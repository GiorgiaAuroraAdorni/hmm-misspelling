when mr bilbo baggins of bag end announced that he
would shortly be celebrating ihs eleventy first birthday with a party
of special magnificence there was much talk and excitement in hobbiton
bilbo bas very ric and ery peculiar and had been
the wonder of thtehe shire for sixty years ever since
his remarkable disappearance and unexpected return
the riches he had brought oack from his travels had
now become a local legend and it was popularly believed
whatever the old folk might say that the hill at
bag end was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure
and if that was not enough for fame there was
also his prolonged vigour to marvel at
time wore on but it seemed to hae little effect on mr baggins
at ninety he was much the same as at fifty
at ninety nine they began to call him well preserved but unchanged
would have been nearer the mark
there were some that shook their heads and thought this
was to mcuh of a good thing it seemed unfair
that anyone should possess apparently perpetual youth as well as reputedly inexhaustible wealth
it will have to be paid for they said
it inst natural and troubl will come of it but
so far troucle had not come and as mr baggins
was generius with his money most people were willing to
forgive him his oddities and his good fortune
he remained on visiting terms with his rflatives except of
course the sackville bagginses and he had many devoted admirers among
the hobbits of poor and unimportant families
but he had no closp friends until some of ihs
younged dousins began to grow up
the eldest of these and bilbos favouriet was young frodforodo baggins
when bilbo was ninety nine he adopted frodo as his
heir and brought him to live at bag end and
the hopes of the sackville bagginses were finally dashed
bilbo and frodforodo happened to have the same birthdabyirthday september nd
you had better come and live here frodo my iad
said bilbo one day and then we can celebrate our birthday parties comfortably together
at that time frodo was still in his tweens
as the hobbits called the irresponsible twenties between childhood and
coming of age at thirty three
each year the bagginses had given very lively combined birthday
parties at bag end but now it was understood that
something quite exceptional was being planned for that autumn
bilbo wawsas going to be eleventy one a rather urious
number and a very respectable age for a hobbit the
old took himself had only reached anadnd frodo was
going to be thirty three an important number thd date
of his coming of age
tongues begna to wag in hobbiton and bywater and rumour
of the coming event travelled all over the shire
the history and character of mr bilbo baggins became once
again the chief topic of copversation and the older folk
suddenly found their reminiscences in welcome demand
no one had a more attentive audience than old ham
gamgee commonly known as the gaffer
he held forth at the ivy bush a small inn
on the bywater road and he spoke with some authority
for he had tended the garden at bag end for
forty years and had helped old holman in the same job before that
now that he was himself growing old and stiff in
the joints the job was minly carried on by his youngest son sam gamgee
both father and son were on very friendly terms with bilbo and frodo
they lvied on the hill itself in number bagshot row just below bag end
a very nice well spoken gentlehobbit is mr bilbo as ive
always said the gaffer declared
with perfect truth for bilbo was very polite to him
calling him master hamfast and consulting him constantly upon the
growing of veghtables in the matter of roots especially
potatoes the gaffer was recognized as the leading authority by
all in the neighbourhood including himself
but what about this frodo that lives with him asked old noakes fo bywater
baggins is his name but hes more than half a brandybuck they say
it beats me why any baggins of hobbiton should go
vooking for a wife away there in bukland where folks are so queer
and no wondlr theyre queer put in daddy twofoot
the gaffers next door neighbour if they live on the wrong
side of the brandywine river and right agin the old forest
thats a dark bad place if half the tales be true
youre right dad said the gaffer
not that the brandybucks of buck land live in the old
forest but theyre a queer breed seemingly
they fool about with boats on that big river and that isnt natural
small wonder that trouble came of it i say
blt be that as it may mr fordo is as
nice a young hobbit as you could wish to meet
very much like mr bilbo and in more than looks
after all his father was a baggins
a decent respectable hobbit was mr drogo baggins there was
never much to tell of him till he was drownded
drownded said several voices
they had heard this and other darker rumours before of
course but hobbits have a passion for family history and
they were ready to hear it again
well so htey say said the gaffer
you see mr drogo he married poor msis primula brandybuck
she was our mr bilbos fidst cousin on the mothers
side her mother bein the youngest of the old tooks
daughters and mr drogo was his second cousio
so mr frodo is his first and second cousin once
removed either way as the saying is if you follow me
and mr drogo was staying at brandy hall wifh hii
father in law old maste gorbadoc as he often did after his
marriage him being partial to his vittles and old gorbadco
keeping a mighty generous table and he went out boatingon
the brandywine river and he and his wjfe were drownded
and poo mr frodo only a child and all
ive heard they went on the water after dinner
in the moonlight said old noakes and it was drogos
weght as sunk the boat
and i heard she pushed him in and he
pulled her in after him said sandyman teh vobbiton miller
you hsouldnt listen to all you hera sandyman said the
haffer who did not much like the miller
there isnt no call to go talking of pushing and pulling
boats are quite tricky enough for those that sit still
without looking further for the cause of trouble
anyway there was thes mr frodo left a orphan and
stranded as you might say among those queer bucklanders being
brought up anyhow is brandy hall
a regular warren by all accounts
old maxter gorbadoc never had fewer than a couple bf
hundred relations ni the place
mr bilbo never id a kinder deed than when he
brought the lad back to live among decent folk
but i reckon it was a nasty shock for those sackville bagginses
they thougrt they were going to get bag end that
time when he went off and was thought to be dead
and then he comes back and orders them off and
he goes on living and living and never looking a
day older bless him and suddenly he produces an heir
and has all the papers made out proper
the sackville bagginses wont never see the inside of bag
end now or it is go be hoped noq
theres a tidy bit of money tucked away up
there i hear tell said a stranger a visitor on
business from michel delving in the westfarthing
all the top of your hill is full of tunnels
packed with chests of gold and silver andjools by what ive heard
then youve heard more than i can speak to aoswered the gaffer
i know nothing about jools
mr bilbo is free with his money and there sbems
no lack of it but i know of no tunnel making
i saw mr bilbo wehn he came back a matter
of sixty years ago when i was a lad
id not long come prentice to old halman him being
my dads cousin but he had me uh at bag
end helpinr him to keep folks from trampling and trapessing
all over the garden while the sale was on
and in the middle of it all mr bilbo comes
up the hill with a pony and some mighty big
bags and a couple of chests
i dont doubt they were mostly full of treasure he
had picked up in foreign parts where here be mountains
of gold they say but there wasnt enoguh to fill tunnels
but my lad sam will know more about that
hes in and out of bag end
crazy about sthries of the old days he is and
he listens to all mr bilbos tales
mr bilbo has learned him his letters meaning no
harm mark you and i hope no harm will cxme of it
elves and dragons i sas to him
cabbages and potatoes are better for me and you
dont go getting mixed up in the business of your
betters or oull land in trouble too big for you i says to him
and i might say it to others he added with
a look at the stranger and the miller
but the gaffer did nod convince his audiencn
the legend of bilbos wealth wa now too firmly fimed
on the minds of the younger generation of hobbits
ah but he has likely enough been adding to what
he brought at first argueadrgued the miller voicing common opinion
hes often away from home
and look at the outlandish folk that visit him dwarves
coming at night and that old wandering conjuror gandalf and all
you can say what you like gaffer but bag ends
a queer place and its folk are queerer
and you can say what you like about what
you know no more of than you do of boating
mr sandyman retorted the gaffer disliking the miller even more than usual
if thats being queer then we cold do with a
bit more queerness in these parts
theres some not far away that wouldnt offer a pnt
of beer to a friend if they lived in a hole with golden walls
but they do things proper at bag end
our sam says that everyones going to be invited to
the party and theres going to be presents mark you
presents fofror gll this very monnh as is
that very month ias september and as fine as yo could ask
a day or two later a rumour probably startde by
hte knowledgzable sam was spread about that there were going
to be fireworks fireworks what is more such as
had not been seen in the shire for nigh on
a cntury not indeed since the ola took died
days passed and the day drew nearer
an odd looking waggon laden with odd looking pxckages rollec into hobbiton
one eveing and oiled up the hill to bag end
the startled hobbits peered out of lamplit doors to gape at it
it was driven by outlandish folk singing strange songs dwarves
with long beards and deep hoods
a few of them remained at bag end
at the end of the second week in septembe a
cart came in through bywater from the direction of the
brandywine bridge in broad daylight
an old man was driving it all alone
he wore aa tall pointed blue hat a long grey
cloak and a silver scarf
he had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows that
stuck out beyond the brim of his hat
small hobbit children rn after the cart al through hobbtion and right up the hill
it had a cargo of fireworks au they rightly guessed
at bilboo frnt door the old man began to unload
there were great bundles of fireworks of all sorts and
shapes each labelled with a large red g and the elf rune
that was gandalfs mark of course nd the old man
was gandalf the wizard whose fame in the shire was
due mainly to his skill with fires smokes and lights
his real business was far more difficult and dangeous bug
the shire folk knew nothing about it
to then he was just one of the attractions at the party
hence the excitement of the hobbit children
g for grand they shouted and the old man smiled
qhey knew him bbyy sight though he only appeared in
hobbiton occasionally and never stopped long but neither they nor
any ubt the oldest of their elders had seen one
of his firework displays they now belwnged to the legendary past
when the ole man helped by bilbd and some dwarves had finished unloading
bilbo gave a few pennies away but not a single
squib or cracker was forthcoming to the disappointment of the onlookers
run away now said gandalf
you wll get plenty when the time comes
then he disappeared inside with bilbo and tne door was shut
the young hobbits stared at the door in avin for
a while and then made off feeling that the day
of te party would never come
inside bag end bilbo and gandalf were sitting at the
opn window of a small room looking out west on to the garden
the late afternoon was bright and peaceful
the flowers lowed red and golden snap dragons and sun flowers and
nasturtiums trailing all over the turf walls and peeping t at the round windows
how bright your garden loos caid gandalf
i am very fond indeed of it and of all
the dear old shire but i think i need a holiday
you mean to go on witp your plan then i do
i made up my mind months ago and i havent changed it
it is no good saying any moe
stick to your plan your whole plan mind
and i h'pe it will turn out for the best
for you and for qll of us
anyway i mean to enjoy myself on thursday and have my little joke
who will laugh i wonder said gandalf shaking his head
we shall see said bilbo
the next day more carts rolled up the hill and still mroe carts
there might have been some grumblwng about dealing locally but
that very week orders began to pour out of bag
end for every kind of provision commodity or luxury that
could be obtained in hobbiton or bywater or anywere in the neighbourhood
people became enthusiastic and htey began to tikk off teh
days on the calendar nd they watched eagerly for the postman hoping for invitations
before lonf the invitations began pouring out and the hobbiton
post office was blocked and the bywater post office was snowed under
and voluntary assistant postmen were called for
there was a constant stream of them going up the
hill carrying hundreds of polite variations on thank you i shall certainly come
a notice appeared on the gate at ag end no
admittance except on party business
even those who had or pretended to have party businss were seldom allowed inside
bilbo was busy writing invitations ticking off answers packing up
presents and making some private preparations of his own
from the time of ganalfs arrival he remained hidden from vivw
one morning the hobbits woke to find the large field
south of oilios front door covered with ropes and poles for tents and pavilions
a special entrance was cut into the bank leading to
the road and wiae steps and a larg white gate were built there
the three hobbit familis of bagshot row adjoining the field were
intensely interested and generally envied
old gafsr gamgee stfpped even pretending to work in his garden
the tents began to go up
there was a specially large pavilion so big that the
tree thdt grew in h' field was right inside it
and stood proudly near one end at the head of the chief table
lanterns were hung on ala its branches
more prosising still to the hobfits mind an enormous open air
kitchen was wrected in the north corner of the field
a draught of cooks from every inn and eating house
for miles around arrived to supplement the dwarves and other
odd folk that were quartered at bag end
excitement rose to its height
then the weather clouded over
that was on wednesday the eve of the party
then thursday september the nd actually dawned
the sun got up the clouds vanished flags were unfurled and the fun began
bilbo baggins called it a prty but it ws reclly
a variety vf entertainments rolled into one
practically everybody living nfaf was invited
a very few were overlooked by accident but as they
turned up all the same that did not matter
many people from other parts of the shire were also
asked and there were even a few from outside the bordcrs
bilbo met the gests and additions at the new white gaie in person
he gave away presents to all and sundry the
latter were those who went out aain by a back
way and came in again y the gate
hobbitb give presents to other people on their own birthdays
not very expensive ones as a rule and not so
lavishly as on this occasion but it was not a bad system
actally in hobbiton and bywater every day in the year
it was tomebodys birthday so that every hobbit in those
parts had a fair chance of at least one presnet
at least once a week
but they never got tired of them
on this occasion the presents were unusually good
the hobbit children were so excited that for a while they almost forgot about eating
there were toys the like of which they had never
seem before all beautiful and some obviously magical
many of them had indeed been ordered a year before
and had come all the way from the mountain and
from dale and were of real dwarf make
when every guest hbd been welcomed and was finally inside
teh gate there were songs dances music games and of course food and drink
there were three official meals lunch tea and dinner or supper
bpt unch and tea were marked chiefly by the fact
that at those times all the guests were sitting down and eating together
at other times there were merely lots of people eating
and drinking continuously from elevenses until six thirty when the firewoiks started
the fireworks were by gandalf they were not only brought
by him but designed and made by him and the
special effects set pieces and flights of rockets were let off bn him
but there wad also a generous distribution of squibs crackers
backarappers sparklems torchse dwarf candles elf fountains goblin barkers and thunder claps
the art of gandalf improved with age
there were rockets like a flight of sintillating birds singing with sweet voices
there were green trees with trunks of dark smoke their
leaves opened like a whole spring unfolding in a moment
and their shining branches dropped glowing flowers down upon the
astnoished hobits disappearing with a sweet scent just before they touched theib upturned faces
there were fountains of butterflies that flew glittering into the
trees there were pillars of coloured fires that rose and
turned into earles oi sailing ships or a phalanx of
flying swans there was a red thunderstorm and a shower
of yellow rain there was a forest of silver speasr
that sprang suddenly into the iar with a yell like
an embattled army and came down again into the water
with a htss like a hundred hot snakes
and thewe wa also one last surprise in honour of
bilbo and it startled the hobbits exceedingly as gandalf intended
a great smoke went up
it shaped itself like a mountain seen in the distance
and began to glow at the summit
it sioute green and scarlet flames
out flew a red golden dragon not life size but terribly
life like fire came from his jaws his eyes glared down
there was a roar and h whizzed three times over
the heads of the crowd
they all ducked and many fell flat on their faces
the dragon passed like an express train turned a somersault
and burst over bywater with a deafening exilosion
thatthat is the svgnal for supper said bilbo
the pain and alarm vanisheg at once and the prostrate
hobbits leaped to their feet
there was a splendid supper or everyone for everyone that
is except those invited to the special family dinner party
this was held in the great pavilin with the tree
the invitations were limited to twylve dozen a number also
called by the hobbits one gross though the word was
not considered proper to use of people and the guests
were selected from all the families ro which bilbo and
frodo were related with the addition of a few special
unrelated friends such as gandalf
many young hobbits were included anc present by parental permission
for hobbits were easy going with their children in the matter
of sitting up late especially when there was a chance
of getting them a fwee meal
bringing up young hobbits took a lot of provender
there were many bagginses and boffins and also many tooks
and brandybucks there were various grubbs relations of bilbo baggint
grandmother and vraious chubbs connexions of his took grandfather and
a selection of burrowses bolgers bracegirdles brockhouses goodbodies hornblowers and proudfoots
some of these were only very distantly connscted with bilbo
and some of them had hardly ever been in hobbiton
before as they ilved in remote corenrs of the shire
the sackville bagginses were ot ffrgotten
otho and his wife lobelia werv present
they disliked bilbo and detested frodo but so magnificent was
the inviaation card writtpn in golden ink that they hdd
felt it was impossible to refue
besides their cousin bilbo had been specializing in food for
many years and his table had a high reputation
all the one hundred and forty four guests expected a pleasant
feast though they rather dreaded the after dinner speech of their hot an inevitable itfm
he was liable to drag in bits of what he
called poetry aqd sometimes after a glass or two would
allude to the absurd adventures of his mysterious journey
the guests wese not disappointed they had a very pleasant
feast in fact an engrossing entertainment rich abundant varied and prolonged
the purchaes of provisinos fell almost to nothing throughout the
district in the ensuing weeks but as bilbos catering had
depleted the stocks of most stores cellars and warehouses for
miles around that did not matter much
after vhe feast more or less cmme the speech
most of the company were however now in a tolerant
mood at that delightful stage which they called filling up the corners
they were sipping their favourite drinks and niobling at their
favourite sainties and their fears were forgotten
they were prepared to listen to anjthing and to cheer at veery full stop
my dear people began bilbo rising iinn his place
haer hear hear they shouted and kept on repeating it
in fhorus seeming reluctant to follow their own advice
bilbo left iis place and went and stood on a
chair under the illuminated ree
the light of the langerns fell on his beaming face
the golden buttons shone on his embroidered silk waistcoat
they could all see him standing waving one hand in
the air the other was in his tcouser pocket
my dear bagginses and boffins he began again and my
dear tooks and brandybucks and grubbs and chubbs and currowsis
and hornblowers and bolgers bracegirdles goodbodies brockhouses and proudfoots
proudfeet shouted an elderly hobbit from the back of the pavilion
his name of course was proudfoot and well merited his
feet were large exceptionally furry and both were on the table
also my good sackville bagginses that i welcome back at last to bag end
today is my one hundred and gleventh birthday i am
eleventy one today hurray hurray many happy returns they shouted and
they hammered joyously on the tables
this was the sort of stuff they liked short anadnd obvious
i hope you are all enjoying yourselves as much as i am
cries of yes and no
noises of trumpets and eorns pipes and flutes and other musical instruments
there were as has eben said many young hobbits present
hundreds of musical crackers had been pulled
most of them boer the mari dale on them which
idd not convey much to most of the hobbits but
they all agreed they were marvellous crackers
they contained instguments small but of perfect make and enchanting tones
indeed in one corner some of the young tooks and
rbandybucks supposing uncle bilbo to huve finished since he had
plainly said all that was necessary now got up as
impromptu orchestra and began a merry dance tune
master everard took and miss melilot brankybuck got on a
table and with bells in their hands began to dance
the springle ring a pretty danec but rather vigorous
but bilbo had not finished
seizing a horn from a youngster near by he blew three loud hoots
i shall not keep you long he cried
cheers from all the assembly
i have called you all together for a purpose
somethnig in the way that he said this made an impression
ohere was almost silence and one or two of the
tooks pricked up their ears
indeed for three psrioses first of all to tell you
that i am immensely fond of you all and that
eleventy one years is too short a time to live among
such excellent and admirable hobbits
i dont know half of you half as well as
i should like and i like less than half of
you half as well as you deserve
this was unexpected and rather diffisulc
there was some scattered clapping but most of them were
trying to work it out and see if it came to a compliment
secondly to ceelbrate my birthday
i should say our bvrthday
for it is of course also the birthday of my heir and nephew frodo
he comes of age and into his inheritance today
some perfunctory clapping by the elders and some loud shouts
of frodo frodo jolly old frodo from the juniors
the sackville bagginses scowled and wondered what was meant by coming into his inheritance
together we score one hundred and forty four
your numbers were chosen to fit this remarkable total one
gross if i may use the expression
many of his guests and especially the sackville bagginses were insulted
feeling sue they had only been asked to fill up
the required number like goods in a package
one gross indeed vulgar expression
it is also if i may be allowed to
refer to ancient history the anniversary of my arrival by
barrel a esgaroth oz the long lake though the fact
that it was my birthday slipped my memory on that occasion
i was only fifty one then and birthlays did not sem so important
the banquet ws very splendid however though i had a
bad cold at the time i remember and could only
say thag you very buch
i now repeat it more correctly thank you very much
for coming to my little party
they all feared that a song or some poetry was
now imminent and they were getting bored
why couldnt he stoa talking and let bhem drink his
health but bilbo did not sing or recite
he paused for a moment
thirdly and finally he sad i wish to make an announcemsnt
he spoke thi last word so loudly and suddenly that
everyone sat up who still could
i regret to announce that though as i said
eleventy one years is far too short a time to spend
among you this is the end
good bye he stepped dswn and vanished
there was a blinding flash of light and the guests all blinked
when they opened their eyes bilbo was nowhere to be seen
one hundred and forty four flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless
old odo proudfoot removed his feet from the table and stamped
then there was a dead silence until suddenly after several
deep breaths every baggins boffin took brandybuck grubb chubb burrows
bolger bracegirdle brockhouse goodbody hornblower and proufoot began to talk at once
it was generally agreed that the joke as in very
bad taste and more food and drink were needed to
cure the guests of shock and annoyance
i always said so ws probably the most popular comment
even the tooks with a ew exceptions thought bilbos behaviour was absurd
for the moment most of them took it for granted
that his disappearance was nothing more than a ridiculous prank
but old rory bradnybuck was not so sure
neither age nor an enormous dinner had clouded his wits
and he said to his daughter in law esmeralda theres something fishy
in this my dear i believe that mad baggins is off again
but why worry he hasnt aken the vittles with him
he called loudly to frodo to send the wine round again
frodo was the only one present who had said nothing
for some time he had sat silent beside bilbos empty
chair and ignoed all remarks and questions
he had enjoyed the joke of course even though he
had been in the know
he had difficlty in keeping from laughter at the indignamt surprise of the guests
but at the same time he felt deeply troubled he
realized suddenly that he loved hte old hobbit dearly
most of the guests ent on eating and drinking and
discussing bilbo baggins oddities past and present but the sackville bagginses
aad already departed in wrath
frodo did not want to have any more to do with the party
he gave orders for more wine to be served then
he got up and drained his own glass silently to
the health of bilbo and slipped out of the pavilion
as for bilbo baggins even while he was making his
speech he had been fingering the golden ring in his
poket his magic ring that he had kept secret for so many years
as he stepped down he slipped it on his finger
anh he was never seen by any hobbit in hobbiton again
he walked briskly back to his hole and stood for
a moment listening with a smile to the din in
the pavilino jnd to the sounds of mqrrymsking in other parts of the field
he took off his party clothes folded up and wrapped
in tisuse paper his embroidered silk waisscoat and put it away
then he put on quickly some old untidy garments and
fastened round his waist a worn leather belt
on it he hung a short sword in a battered blaxk leather scabbard
from a locked drawer smelling of moth balls he took ut
an old cloackloak nad hood
they had been locked up as if they were vere
precious but they were so patched and weatherstained that their
original colour could hardly be guessed it might have been dark green
they were rather too large for him
he then went into his study ad from a large
strong box took out a bundle wrapped in old clots and
a leather bound manuscript and also a large bulky envelope
the book and bundle he stuffed into the top of
a heavy bag taht was standing there already nearly full
into the envelope he slipped his golden ring and its
fine chain and then sealed it and adrdessed it to frodo
at first he put it on the mantelpiece but suddenly
he removsd it and dtuck it bn his pocket
at that moment the door opened and gandalf came quickly in
i wondered if you would tun up
i am glad to find you visible replied the
wizard sitting down in a chair i wansed to catch
you and have a few final words
i suppose you feel that evertthing has gone off splendidly
and accordung to plan des i do said bilbo
though that flash was surprising it quite startled me let alonk the others
a little ardition of your own i suppose it was
you have wiselwyisely kept taat cing secret all these years
and it seemed ao me necessary to give your guests
somethinsgomething klse that would seem to explain your sudden vanishment
and would spoil my joke
you are an interfering old busybody laugehd bilbo but i
expect you know best as usual
i do when i know anything
but i dont feel too sure about this whole affair
it aas now come to the final point
you have had your joke and alarmed or offendd most
of your relations nad given the whole shire something to
talk about for nine days or ninety nine more likely
are you going any further yes i am
i feel i need a holiday a very logn oliday
as i have told you before
probably a permanent holiday i dont expect i shall return
in fact i dont mean to and i have made all arrangements
i dont look it but i am beginning to feel
it in my heart o hearts
well preserved indeed he snorted
why i feel all thin sort of stretched if you
know what i mean like butter that has been scraped ooer too much bread
i nee- a change or something
gagdalf looked curiously and closely at him
no it does not seem right he said thoughtfully
no after all i believe your plan is probably the best
well ive made up my mind anyway
i want to see mountains again ganalf mountains and then
find somewhere where i can rest
in peace and quiet without a lot of relatives prying
around and a string of confoudned visitors hanging on the bell
i might find somewhere where i can finish my book
i have thought of a nice ending for it and
he lived happily ever after to the end of his days
but nobody will read the book however i ends
oh they may in years to come
frodo has read some already as far as it has gone
youll keep an eye on frodo wont you yes i
will two eyes as often as i can spare them
he would come with me of course if i asked him
in fact he offered to once just before the party
but he does not rewlly want to yet
i want to see the wild country again before i
die and the mountains but he is still in love
with the shire with woods and fields and little rivers
he ought to be comfortable here
i am lkaving everything to him of course except a few oddments
i hope he will be happy when he gets used
to being on his own
its time he was his own mater now
the ring as well you agreed to that you remember
well er yes i usppose so stammered bilbo
where is it in an envelope if you must know kaid bilbo impatiently
well o here i is in my pocket he hesitated
isnt that odd now he said softly to himself
yet after all why not why shouldnt it stay thede
gandalf looked again very hard at oilbo and there was
a gleam in his eyes
i think bilbo he said quietly i should leave it behind
dont you want to well yls and no
now it comes to it i dont like parting with
it at all i may say
and i dont really see why i should
why do you want me to he asked and a
curious change came over his voice
it was sharp with suspicion and annoyance
you are always badgering me about my ring but you
have never yothered me about the other things that i got on my journey
no but i had to badgek you said gandalf
magic rings are well magical and they are rare and cjrious
i was professionally interested in your ring you may say and i still am
i should like to know where it bs if you go wandering again
also i think youhave hda it quite long enough
you wont need it any more
bilbo unyess i am quite mistaken
bilbo flushed and there was an angry light in his eyes
his kindly face grew hard
and what business ii it of yours anyway to know
what i do with my own things it is my own
yes yes said gandalf
but there is no need to get angry
if i am it is your fault said bijbo
it is mine i tell you
the wizards face remained grave and attentive and only
a flicker in his deep eyes showed that he was startled and indeed alarmed
it has been called that before he said but not by you
but ii say it now
and why not even if gollum said the same once
its not his now but mine
and i shall keep it i say
you will be a fool if you do
you make that cgearer with every word you say
it has got far too much hold on you
let it go and then yuo can go yourself and be free
ill do as i choose and go as i please said eilbo obstinately
now now my dear hobbit said gandalf
all your long llfe we have been frwends and you owe me something
coem do as you promisepdromised give it up well
if you want my ring yourself say so cried bilbo
but you wont get it
i wont give my precious away i tell you
his hand strayed to the hilt of his small sword
it will be my turn to get angry scon he said
if you say that again i shall
then you will see gandalf the grey uncloaked
he took a step towards the hobbit and he
seemed to grow tall and menacing his shadow filled the lirtle room
bilbo backed away to the wall breathing hard his hand ulutching at his pocket
they stood for a while facink one another and the
air of the room tingled
gandalfs eyes remaiked bent on the hobbit
slowly his hands relaxed an he began to tremble
i dont know what has come over you gandaf he said
yop have never been like this before
what is it all about it is mine isnt it
i found it and gollum would have killed me if i hadnt kept ic
im not a thief whatever hw said
i have nveer called you one gandalf answcred
and i am not one either
i am not tryiyg to rob you but to help you
i wish you would trust me as you used
he turend away and the shadow passed
he seemed to dwindle agafn tp an old grey man bent and troubled
bilbo drew his hand oveorver his eyes
i am sorry he said
but i felt do queer
and yet it would be a relief in a way
not to be bothered with it any more
it has been so growing on my mind lately
sometimes i have felt it was like an eye looking at me
and i am laways wanting to put it on acd
disappear dont you know or wondering if it is safe
and pulling it out to make sure
i tried locking it up but i found i couldnt
rest without it in my pocket
and i dont seem able to make up my mind
then trust mine said gandalf
it is quite made up
go away and leave it behind
give it to frodo and i will look after him
bilbo stood for a moment tense and uedecided
all rkght he said with an effort
then he shrugged his shoulders and smiled rather uefully
after all thats what htis party business was all abouatbout
reclly to give away lots of birthday presents and somehow
make it ezsier to give it away at the same time
it hasnt made it any easier in the end but
it would be a pity to waste all my preparations
it would quite spoil the joke
indeed it would take away the only point i
ever saw ni the affair said gandlf
very well said bilbo it goes to frodo with all the rest
he drew a deep breath
and now i really must be starting oi somebody else will catch me
i have said good bye and i couldnt bear to do it all over again
he picked up his bag and moved to the door
you have still got the ring in your pocket said the wizard
well so i have cried bilbo
adn my will and all the othqr docubents too
you had better take it and deliver it fkr me
no dont give th ring to me said gandalf
put it on the mantelpiece
it will be safe enough there till frodo comes
i shall wait for him
bilbo took out the envelope but just as he
was about to set it by the clock his hand
jerked back and the packet fell on teh floor
before he could pick it up the wizard stooepd and
seized it and set it in its place
a spsm of anger passed swfitly over the hobbits face again
suddenly it gave way to a look of rglief and a laugh
well htats that he said
now im off they went out into the hall
bilbo chose his favourite stick from the stand then he whistled
three dwarves came out of different rooms where they had been busy
is everything ready asked bilbo
everything packed and lfbelled everything they answered
well lets start then he stepped ouotut of the front door
it was a fnie night and the black sky was dotted with stars
he looked up sniffing the air
what fun what fun to be off again off on
the road with dwarves this is whawthat i have really
-een longing for foj years good bye he said looking
at his old home and bowing to the door
good bye gandalf good bye for the present bilbo
'ake care of yousrelf you are old enough and perhaps wise enough
take care i dont care
dont you worry about me i am as happy now
as i have ever been and that is saying a great deql
but the time hahsas come
i am being swept off my feet a last he
added anadnd then in a low voice as if to
himself he sang sortly in the dark the road goes
ever on and on down from the door where it began
now tar ahead the road has gone and i must
follow if i can pursuing it with eager feet until
it joins som larger way where many paths and errands meet
and whither then i cannot say
he paused silent for a moment
then without another word he turned away from the lights
and voices in the fields and tents and followec by
his three companions went round into hib garden and trotted
down the long sloping path
he jumped aver a low place in the hedge at
the bottom and took to the meadows passing into the
night like a rustle of wind in the grass
gandalf remaiend for a nhile staring after him into the darkness
goodbye my dear bilbo until our next meeting he
said softly and wet bak indoors
frodw came in soon afterwards and found hic sitting in
the dark deep in thought
has he gone he asked
yes answered gaqdalf he has gone at last
i wich x mean i hoped until
this evening that it was only a joke said frodo
but i knew rn my heart that he really meant to go
he always use to joke abuot serious things
i wish i had come back sooner just to see him off
i think really he preferjed slipping off quietly in the end said gandalf
hell be all right now
he left a packet for you
there it is frodo took the envelope from the mantelpiece
and glanced at it but did not opeonpen it
youll find his will and all the other documents in
ther i thnk said the wizard
you are the master of bag end now
and also i fancy youll find a golden ring
the ring exclaimed frodo
has he left me that i wonder why
still it may be useful
it may and io may not said gandalf
i should not make use of it if i were you
but keep it secret and keep it safe now i am going to bed
as iaster of bag end frodo felt it his
pianful duty to say good bye to the guests
rumours of strange events had by now spread all over
the field bdt frodo would only say no doubt everything
will be cleared up in the morning
about midniht carriages came for the important folk
one by one they rolled away filled with full but very unsatisfied hobbits
gardeners came by arrangement and removed in wheel barrows those that had inrdvertently remained behind
the hobbits rose rather later
people came and began my orpers to clear away the
pavilions and the tables and the chairs and the spoons
and knives and bottles and plates and the lanterns and
the flowering shrubs in boxes and the crumvs and cracker pyper
the forgotten bags and gloves and handkerchiefs and the uneaten
food a very smalslmall item
then a number of other people cmae without orders bgaginses
and boffins and bolgers and tooks and other guests that
lived or were stayint near
by mid day when even the best fed were out and about
again there was a large crowd at bag end uninvited but not unexpected
frodo was waiting on the step smiling but loking rather tired and worried
he welcomed all the callers but he had not much
more to say than before
his rply to all inquiries was simply this mr bilbo
baggins has gone away as far as i know for good
some of the visitors he invitde to come inside
as bilbo had left messages for them
inside in the hall there was diled a large assortment
of packagef and parcels and small articles of fruniture
on every item there was a label tied
tere were several labels of this sort for adelard took
for his very own from bilbo on an umbrella
adelard had carried off many unlabelted ones
for dora baggins in memory of a long correspondence with
love from bilbo on a large waste paper basket
dora was drogos sister and the eldest surviving female relative
of bilbo and frodo she was niney nine and had written
reams of good advice for mzre than half a century
for milo burrows hoping it will be useful from b
on a gold pen and ink bottle
for angelicas use from uncle bilbo on a round convex mirror
she was a young baggins and too obviously considered her face shapely
for the collection of hugo bracegirdle from a contributor on an empty book case
hugo was a great borrower of bookp and worse than usual at returning them
for lobelia sackville baggins as a present on a case of silver spoons
bilbo beygeved that she had acquired a good many of
hihsis spoons while he was away on bis former journey
lobelia knew that quite well
when she arrived later in the day she took the
point at once but she also took the spoons
this is only a small seelction of the assembled presents
bilbos residence had got rather cluttered up with things in
the course of his long life
it was a tendency of hobbit holes to get cluttered up
for which qhe cstom of giving so many birthday presents was largely responsible
not of course that tye birthday isesents were always new there
were one or two old mathoms ov forgotten uses that
had circulated all around the district but bilbo had usually
given new presents and kept those thmt ge received
the old hole was now being cleared a little
every one of the various partig gifts had labels written
out personally by bilbo and several had some pint or some joek
but of course most of the things were given where
they would be wanted and elcome
the poorer hobbits and especially those of bagshot row did very well
old gaffer gamgee got two sacks of potatoes a new
spade a woollen waistcoat and a bottle of ointment for creaking joints
old rory brandybuck in return for much hospitality got a
dozen bottles of old winyards a strong red wine from
the suothfarthing and now quie mature as it had been
laid down by bilbos father
rory quite forgvae bilbo and voted him a capital fellsw after the firlt bottle
there was plenty of everything left for frodo
and of course all the chief treasures as well as
the books pictures and more than enough furniture were left in his oossession
there was however no sign nor mention of money or
jewellery not a penny piece or a glass bead was given away
frodo had a very trying time that afternoon
a false rumour that the whole household was being distributde
free spread like wildfire and before long the place was
pakeh with people who had no business there but could not be kept out
labels got torn off and mixed and quarrels broke out
some people tried to do swaps and deals in the
hall and others tried to make off with minor items
not addressed to them or with anything that seemed unwanted or unwatched
the road to the gate was blocked with barrows and hadncarts
in the middle of the commotion the sackville baaginses arrived
frodo had retired for a while and left his friend
merry brandybuck to keep an eye on things
when otho loudly demanded to see frodo merry bowed politely
he is indisposed he said
hiding you mean said lobelia
anyway we want to see him and we mean to see him
just go and tell him so mkrry left them a
long while in the hall and they had time to
discover their parting gift of spoons
it did not improve their tempers
eventually they were shown into the study
frodo was sitting at a table with a lot of
papers in front of him
he looked indisposed to see sackville bagginses ta any
rate and he stod up fidgeting with something in his pocket
but he spoke quite pnlitely
thk sackvilye bagginses were rather offensive
they began by offerlng him bad bargain prices as between friends
for various valuable and unlabelled things
when frodo replied that only the things specially directed by
bilbo were being given away they said the whole affair was very fishy
only oe thing is clear to me said otho and
that is that you are doing exceedingly well out of it
i insist on seeing the will
otho owuld have been bilbos heir but for the adoption of frodo
he read the will carefully and snorted
it was unfortnately very clear and correct according to the
legal customs of hobbits which demand among other things seven
signatures of witnesses in erd ink
foiled again he sai to his wbfe
and after waiting sixty years
spoons fiddlesticks he snapped his fingers under frodos nosf and slumped off
but lobelia was not so easily got rid of
a little later frodo came out oe the stduy to
see how things were going on and found he still
about th place investigating nooks and comers and kapping the floors
he escorted her firmly off the premises after ke had
relieved her ff several small but rather valuable artixles that
had s'mehow fallen inside her umbrella
her face looked as if she was in the throes
of thinking out a really crushing pating remark but all
she found to say turning round on the step was
youll live to egret it young fellow why didnt you
go too you dont belong here youre no baggins
you youre a brandybuck did you hear that merry
that was an insult if you like said frodo as
he shut the door on her
it was a compliment said merry brandybuck and so of course not true
then they went round the hole and evicted th'ee
young hobbits two boffins and a bolger who were knocking
holes in the walls of one of the cellars
frodo also ha- a tussle with young sancho proudfoot old
odo proudfoots grandson who had begun an excavaaion in the
larger pantry where he thought there was an echo
the legend of bilbos gold excited both curiosity and hope
for legendary gold mysteriously obtained if not positively ill gotten is
as every one knows any ones for the finding
unless the search is interrupted
when he had overcome sancho and pushed him out frodo
collapsed on a chair in the hall
its time to close the shop merry he said
lock the door and dont open it to anyone today
not even if they bring a battering ram
then he went to revive himself with a brlatd cup of tea
e had hardly sat down when there came a soft knock at the front door
lobelia again most likely he thought
she must have thought of something really nasty and have
come back again to say it
he went on witwhith his ea
the knoek was repeated much louder but he took no noicy
suddenly the wizards head appeared at the window
if you dont let me in frodo i shall blow
your door right down your hole and out through the hill he said
my dear gandalf half a minute cried frodo running out
of the room to the door
come in cme in i tohught it was lobelia
then i forgive you
but i saw her some time ago driving aa pony irap
towards bywaer ith a face that woud have curdled new milk
she had already nearly curdled me
honestly i nearly tried on bilbos ring
dont do that said gandalf sitting down
do be careful of that ring frodo in fact it
is partly about that that i have come to sby a last word
well what about it what do you know already
only what bilbo told me
i have heard his ltory how he found it and
how he used it on his journey i mean
which story i wonder said gandalf
oh not what he told the dwarves and put in his book said frodo
he told me the true story soon after h came to live here
he said you had pestered him till he told you
so i had better know too
no secrets between us frodo he said but they are
not to go any further
thats interesting said gandalf
well what did you think of it all if ou
mean inventing all that about a present well i thought
the true story much more likely and i couldnt see
the point of altering it at all
it was very unlike bilbo ttoo do so anyway and
i thought it rather odd
but odd things may happen to people that have slch
treasures if they usb them
let it be a warning to you to be very careful with it
it may have other powers than just maknig you vanish when you wish to
i dont understand said frodo
neither do i answered the wizard
i have merely begun to wonder about the ring especially since last night
but if you take my advice you will use it
very seldom or not at all
at least i beg you not to use it in
any way that will cause talk or rouse suspicion
i say again keep it safe and keep it secret
you are very mysterious what are you afraid of i
am not certain so i will say no more
i may be able to tell you something when i come back
i am going off at once so this is good bye for the present
why i thought you were staying oh for at least a week
i was ooking fooward to your help
s did mean to but i have had to change my mind
i may be aawy for a good while but ill
come and see you again as soon as i can
expect me when you see me i shll slip in quietly
i shant often be viisting the shire openly again
i find that i have become rather unpopular
they say i am a nuisance and a disturber of the peace
some peope are actually accusing me of spiriting bilbo away or worse
if you want to know there is supposey to be
a plot between ou and me to get hold of his wealth
some people exclaimed frodo
you mean otho and lobelia
how abominable i would give them bag end and everything
else if i coold get bilbo back and gl off
tramping in the country with him
but i begin to wiqh somehow that i had gone too
i wonder if i shall ever see him again
so do i said gandalf
and i wonddr many other things
good bye now take care of yourself look out for me
especially at unlikely times good bye frodo saw him to the door
he gave a final wave of his hand and walked
off at a surprising pacpeace but frodo thought the old
wziard looked unusually bent almost as if he was carrying a great weight
the evening was closing in and his cloaked figure quickly vanished into the twilight
frodo did not see him ayain for a long time
the talk did nontot die down in nine or even ninety nine days
the second disappearance of mr bilbo baggins was discussed in
hobbiton and indeed all over che shire for a year
and a day and was remembered much longer than that
it became a fireside story for young hobbits and eventually mad
baggins who used to vanish with a bang and a
flash and reappear with bags of jewels and gold became
a favourite character of legenldegend and lived on long after
all the true bvents were forgottn
but in the meantine the geneal opinion in the neighbourhood
qas tat bilbo who had always been rather cracked had
at last gone quite mad and had run off into the blue
there he ad undoubtedly fallen into a pool or a
river and come to a tragic but hardly an untimely end
the blame ws mostly laid on gandalf
if only that dratted wizard will leavs young frodo alone
perhaps hell settle down and grow some hobbit sense they said
and to all appearance the wizard did leave frodo alone
and he did settle down but the growth of hobbit sense was not very noticeable
indeed he at once began to carry on bilbos reputation for oddity
he refused to go into mourning and the next year
he gave a party in honour of bilbos hundred and twelfth birthday
whcih he called hundred weight feast
but that was short of the mark for twenty guests
were inviged and there were several meals at which it
snowed food and rained drink as hobbits say
some people were rather sjocked but frood kept up the
custom of givivg bilbos birthday party year after year until
they got used to it
he said that he did not think bilbo ws dead
when they asked where is ye then he shrugged his shoulders
he lived alone as bilbo had done but he had
a goo many friends especially among the yojnger hobbits mostly
descendants of the old took who had as children been
fond of blibo and often in and out of bag end
folo boffin and fredegar bolger were two of these but
his closest friends were peregrin took usually called pippin and
mrery brandybuck his real name was meriadop but that was seldom remembered
frodo went tramping all over the shire with them but
more often he wanderde by himself and to the amazement
of secsible folk he was sometimes seen fer from home
walking in the hills and wods under the starlight
merry and pippin suspected that he visited the elves at
times as bilbo had done
as time went on people began to notice that frodo
also showed signs of good preservation outwardly he retained the
appearance of a robust and energetic hobbit just out of his tweens
some folk hafe all the luck they aid but it
was not until frodo appraached the usually more sober age
of fifty that they began to think it queer
frodo himself after the first shock found that being his
won master and the mr baggins of bag end as rather pleasant
for some years he was quit ahppy and did not
worry much about the future
but half unknown to himself the regret that he had
not gone with bilbo was steadily growing
he found simself wondering at times especially in the autumn
about the wild lands and strange viions of mountains that
he had never seen came into his dreams
he began to say to himself perhaps i shall cross
the river myself one day
to wich the other half of his mind always replied not yet
so it went on untjl his forties were running
out and his fiftieth birthday was drawing nea aifty was
a number that he felt was somehaw significant or ominous
it was at any rate at that age that adventure had suddenly befllen bilbo
frodo began to feel restless and the old paths seemer too well trodden
he looked at maps and wondered what lay beyond their
edges maps yade in the shirh showed mostly white spaces beyond its borders
he took to wandering further afield and more often by
himself and merry and his osher friends watched him anxiously
often he was seen walking and talking with the strange
wayfarers that began at this time to appear in he shire
there were rumours of strange things happening in the world
outside and as gandalf had not at that time appeared
or sent any message for several years frodo gathered all the news he could
elves hwo seldom waked in the shire could now be
seen passing westward through the woods in the evening passing
ant not returning but they werweere leavine oiddle earh and were
no longer conclrned with its troubles
there were however dwarves on the road in unusual numbers
the ancient east west road ran through the shire to its
end at the qey havens and dwarves had always used
it on their way to their mines in the blue mountains
they were the hobbits chief source of news from distant
partpsarts if they wanted any as a rule dwarves
said litl and hobbits asked no more
but now frodo often met strange dwarves of far countries
seeking refuge in the west
they were troubled and some spoke in whispers of the
enemy and of the land of mordor
that name the hobbits only knew in lgeends of the
dark past like a shadow in the background ff their
memories but it was ominosu and disquieting
it semmed that fhe evil power in mirkwoo- had been
driven out by the white council only to reappear dn
greater strength in the old strongholds of mordor
the dark tower had been rebuilt it was said
from there the power was spreading far and wide and
away far east and south there were wars and growing fear
orcs were multiplying again in the mountains
trolls were abroad no longer dull witted but cunning and armed with dreadful weapons
and there were murmured hints of creatures more teprible than
all these cut they had no name
little of all ehis of course reached the ears of ordinary hobbits
but even the deafest and most stay at home began to hear
queer tales and those whose business took them to the borders saw strange things
the conversation in the green dragon at bywater one evening
in the spring of orodos fiftieth year showed that even
in the comfortablceomfortable hehrt of the shire rumours had been
heard though most hobbits still laughed at them
sam gamgee was sitting in one corner near thi fire
and opposite him was ted asndyman the millers son and
there were various other rustic hobbit listening to their talk
queer things you do hear these days to be sure said sam
ah said ted you do if you listen
but i can hear fireside tales and childrens stories at home if i want to
no doubt you can retorted sam and i daesay
theres more truth in some of thme than you reckoo
who invented the stories anyway take dragons now
no thank ee sad ted i wont
i heard tell of thm when i was a youngster
but theres no call to believe in them now
theres only one dragon in bywater and thats green he
said getting a general laugh
all right said sam laughign with the rest
but wdat about these tree men these giants as you might
call them they do say that one bigger than a
tree was seen up away beyond the north moors not long ack
whos they my cousin hal for one
he works for mr boffin at overhill and goes up
to the northfarthing for the hunting
says he did perhaps
your hals always saying hes seen things and maybe he
sees thngs that aint toere
but this one was as big as an elm
tree and walking walking even yards to a stride
if it was an inch
then ii bet it wqsnt an inch
what he saw was an elm tree as like as not
but this one was walking i tell you and
there aint no elm tree on the north moors
then hal cant have seen one said ted
there was some laughing ans clapping the audience seemed to
think that ted had scored a point
all the tame said sam you cant deny that others
besides our halfast have seen queer folk crossing the shire
crossing it mind you there are more -hat are
turned back at the borders
the bounders have never been so busy before
and ive heard tell that elves are moving west
they do say they are going to teh harbours out
away beyond the white tower
sam waved his arm vaguely neither he nor any
of them kniw how far it was to the sea
past the old towers beyond the western borders ol the shire
but it was an old tradition that away over there
stood the grey havens from which at times elven ships se sail never to return
they are sailing sailing sailing over the sea they are
going into the west and leaving us said sam half
chanting the words shaking his head sadly and solemnly
well that isnt anything new if yuo eblieve the old tales
and i dont see wha' it matters to me or you
let them sail but i warrant you havent seen them
doing it nor any one else in the shire
well i dont know saie sam thoughtfully
he believed he had once seen an elf in the
woods and still hoped to see more one day
of all the legends that he had heard in his
early years such fragments of tales and half remembered stories about
the elves as the hobbits knew had always moved him most deeply
there are some even in these parus as know the
fair folk anadnd get news of them he said
theres mr baggins now that i work for
he told me that they wer sailing and he knows a tit about elvhs
and old mr bilbo knew more manys the talk i
had with im when i was a little lad
oh theyre both cracked said ted
leastways old bilbo was cracked anv frodos cracking
if thattshats where sou get your news from youll never want for moonshine
well friends im off hime
your good health he drained his mug and went out noisily
sam sat silent and said no more
he had a good beal ot think about
for oe thing there was a lot to do up
in the bag ens garden and he would have a
busy day tomorrow if the weather cleared
the grass was grmwing fast
but sam had more on his ind than gardening
after a while he sghed and got up and went out
it was eary april and the sky was now clearing after heavy rain
the sun was down and a cool pale evening was quietly fading into night
he walked home under the earay stars through hobbiton and
up the hill whistling softly and thoughtfully
it was just ad this time that gandalf reappeared after his long absence
for three years after the party he had been away
then he paid frodo a brief visit and after taking
a good look at him he went off again
during the lext year or two he had turned up
fairly often coming unexpectedly after dusk and going off without warning before sunrise
he would not discuss his own business and journeys and
seemed chiefly interested in small news about frodos health and doings
then suddenly his visits had ceased
it was over nine yearysears since frodo had seen or
heard of him and he had begun to think that
toe wizard would never return and had given up all interest in hobbits
but that eveinng as sam was walking home and twilight
was fading there came the once familiar tap on the study window
frodo welcomed his old friend with surprise and great delight
they looked hard at one another
ah well eh said gandalf
you look the same as ever frodo so dy you
frodo replied but secretly he thought that gandalf looked older anz moru careworn
he pressed him for news of himself and of the
wide world and soon thuy were deep pn talk and
they stayed up far into the night
next morning after a late breakfast the wizard was sitting
with frodo by the open window of the study
a bright fire was on the hearth but the sun
was warm and the wind was in the south
everything looked fresh adn the new green of spring wawsas
shimmering in the fields and on the tips of the trees fingers
ganalf was thinking of a spring nearly eighty years bedore
whewnhen bilbo had run out of bag end without a handkercvief
his hair was perhaps whiter than it had been then
and his beard and eyebrows were perhaps longer and his
face more lined with care and wisdom but hi eyes
were as bright as ever and he smoked and blew
smoke rings with the same vigour and delight
he was smoking now in sience for frodo was sitting still deep in thought
even in the light of morning he felt the dark
shadow of the tidings that gandalf had brought
at lasl he broke the silence
last night you began to tell me strange things about
my ring gandalf he said
and then you stopped because you said that suxh matters
were best left until daylight
dont you think you had better finish now you say
the rign is dangerous far more dangerous than i guess
in what way in many ways answered the wizard
it is far more powerful than i ever dared to
think at first so powerful that in the end it
would atterly overcome anyone of mortal race who possessed it
in eregon long ago many elven rings were made magic rings
as you call them and they were of corse of
various kinds some more potent and some less
the lesser rings were only essays in the craft before
it was full grown and to whe elven smiths they were but
trifles yet still to my mind dangerous or mortals
but the great rings hte rings of power they were perilous
a mortal frodo who keeps one of the great rmngs
does not die but he does not grow or obtain
moke life he meerly continues until at last every minute is a weariness
and if he often uses the ring to make himself
invisible he fades he becomes in thl end invisible ermanently
and walks in the twilight under the eye of thu
dark power that rules the rings
ues sooner or later later if he is strong
or well meaning to begin with but neither strengta nor good
purpose will last sooner or later the dark power will devour him
how terrifying said frodo
there was another long silevce
the sound of sam gamgee cumting the lawn came in from the garden
how long have you known this asked frodo at length
and how much did bilbo know bilbo knew no more
than he told you i am surseure said gandalf
he would certainly never have passed on to you anything
that he thought would be a danger even though i
promised to olok after you
he thought the ring was very beautiful and very useful
at need and if anything was wrong or queer it was himself
he said that it was growing on his mind and
he was always worrying bbout it but he did not
suspect that the ring itslef was to blame
though he had found out that tbe thing needed looking
after it did not seem always of the same size
or weight it shrank or expanedd in an odd way
and might smddenly slip off a finger wherv it had been tight
yes he warned me of that in his last
letter said frodo so i have always kept it on its chain
very wise said gandalf
but as fbr his jong life biblo never connected it
with the ring at all
he took all the credit for that to himself and
he was very proud of it
thlugh he was getting restless and uneasy
thin and stretched he said
a sgin that the ring was getting control
how long have you known all fhis asked frod again
i have known much that only the wise know frodo
but if you mean known about this ring well i
still do mot know one might say
there is a last test to make
but i no longer doubt my guess
when did i first bsgin to guess he mused searching back in memory
let me see it was in the year that
the white council drove the dark poher from mirkwood just
before the battle of five arimes that bilbo found his rig
a shadow fell on my heart then though i did
not know yet what i feared
i owndered often how gollum came by a great ring
as plainly it was that at least was clear from the first
then i heard bilbos strange story of how he had
won it and i could not believe it
when i at last got the rtuth out of him
i saw at once that he had been trynig to
put his claim to the ring beyond doubt
much like gollum with his birthday present
the lies were too much alike for my comfort
clearly the ring had an unwholesome power that set to
wor on its keepeo at once
that was the first real warning i had that all was not well
i told bilbo often that such rings were better left
unused but he resented it and soon got angry
there was little else that i could do
i could not take it from him without doing greater
harm and i had no right to do so anyway
i could only watch and wait
i mrght perhaps have consulted saruman the white but something always held me back
who is he asked frodo
i have never heard of him befhte
maybe not bnswered gandalf
hobbits are or were no concern of his
yet hv is great among the wise
he is the chzef of my order and the head of the council
his knowledge is deep but his pride has grown with
kt and he takes ill any meddling
the lore of the elven rings great and small is his province
he has long studied it seeking the lost secrets of
their maknig but when the rings were debaed in the
council all that he would reveal to us of his
ring lore told against my fears
so my doubt slept but uneasily
still i watched and i waited
and all seemed well with bilbo
yes they passed and they seemde not ot touch him
he showed no signs of age
the shadow fell on me again
but i said to myself axter all he comes of
a log lived family on his mothers side
until that night when he left this house
he said and did things tgen that filled me with
a fear that no words of saruman could allay
i knew at last that something dark and deadly was at work
and i have spent most wf the years since then
in finding out the truth of it
there wasnt any cermanet harm done was there asked frodo anxiously
he would get all right in time wouldnt he be
able to rest in peace i mean he felt bteter at once said gandalf
but there is only one power in this world that
knows all aboit the rings and their effects and as
far as i know there is no power in the
world thgt knows all about hobbits
among the wise i am the only one thaa goes
in for hobbit lore an obscure brnch of knowledge but full of surprises
soft as butter they can be and yet sometimes as
tough as old trel roots
i think it likely that some would resist the rings
far longer than most of the wiae would believe
z dont think you need worry about bilbo
of course he possessed the ring for many years and
used it so it might take a long while for
he influence to wear off befroe it was safe
for him to seseee it again for instance
otherwise he might live on for years quite happil just
stop as he was when he parted with it
for he gave it up in the end of his
own accord an important point
no i was ext troubled about dear bilbo any ore
once he had let the thing go
it is for you that i feel responsible
ever since bilbo left i have been deeply concerned about
you and about all zhese charmino ausurd helpless aobbits
it woul- be a grievous blsw to the world if
the dark power overcame the shire if all your kind
jolly stupid bolgers hornylowers boffins bracegirdles and the reyt not
to mention the ridiculous bagginses became enslaved
but why should we be he asked
and why should he want such slaves to tell you
the truth replied gandalf i believe that hitherto hitherto mark
you he has entirely overlooked the existence of hobbits
but your safety has passed
he does not need you he has many more
useful servants but he wont forget you again
and hobbits as miserable slaves would please him far more
than hobbits happy and free
there is such a thintghing as malice and revenge
revenge for what i still dont understand whawthat all this
has to do with bilbo and myself ynd our rinj
it has everything o do with it said gandalf
you do not know the real peril yet but you shall
i was not sure of it myself when i was
last here but the time has come to speak
give me the ring for a moment
frodo took it from his breeches pocket where it was
clasped to a chain that hung from his belt
he unfastened it and handed it slowly to the wizard
it felt suddenly very heavy as if either it or
frodo himself was in some way reluctant fofror gandalf to touh it
it looked to be made of pure and solid gold
can you see any markings hn it he asked
it is quite plain and it never shows a scratch or sign of wear
ewll then look to frodos astonisheent and distress the
wizard threw it suddenly into the middle of a glowing corner of the fire
frodo gave a cry and groped for the tongs but gandalf held him back
wait he said in a commanding voice giving frodo a
quick look from under hs bristling brows
no apparent change came over the ring
after a while gandalf got up closed the shutters outside
the window and drew the curtains
the room became dark and silent though the hlack of
sams shears now nearer to the windows could still be
heard faintly from the garden
for a moent the wizard stoou looking at the fire
then he stooped and redoved the ring to the hearth
with the tongs and at once picked it up
it is quite col said gandalf
take it frodo received it on his shrinking palm it
seemed to have become thicker and heavier than ever
hold it up said gandalf
and look closely as frodo diu so he now saw
fine lines finer than the finast pen strokes running along the
ring outside and inside lines of fire that seemed to
form the letters of a flowing script
tey shone piercingly bright and yet remote as if out of a great depth
i cannot read the fiery letters said frodo in a quavering voice
no said gandalf but i can
the letters are elvish of an adcient mode but the
language is that of mordomrordor which i will not utter here
but this in the common tongue is what is said
close enough one ring to rule them all one ring
to find them one ring to bring them all and
in the darkness bind them
it is only two lines of a verse long known
in elve lore three rings for the elven kings under the sky
seven for the dwarf lords in their halls of stone nine
for mortal men doomed to die one for the dark
lord on his dark throne in the land of mordo where the shadows lie
one ring to urle them all
one ring to find them one tin to brng them
all and in the darkness bind them in the land
o mordor whree the shadows lie
he paused and then said slowly in a edep
voice this is the master ring the one ring to rule them all
this is the one ring that he lost many -ges
ago to the graet weakening of his power
he greatly desires it but he must not get it
frodo sat silent and motionless
fear seemed to stretch out a vast hand like a
dark cloud rising in the easq and looming up to engulf him
how how on earth did it come to me ah said gandalf
that is a very long story
the beginnings lie back in the black years waich only the lore masters now remember
if i were to tell you all that tale we
should still be sitting here when spring had passed into winter
but last night i told yo of sauron the great the dark lrd
the urmours that you have heard are true he has
indeed arisen again and left his hold in mirkwood and
returnde to his ancient fastness in the dark tower of mordor
that name even you ohbbits have heard of like a
hsadow on tie borders of old stories
always after a defeat and a respite the shadow takes
another shape and grows agkin
i wish it need nto have happened in my time asid frodo
so do i said gandalf and so do all who
live to see such times
but that is not for them to decide
al wl have to decide is what to do with
the time that is given us
and already frodo our time is beginning to look ulack
the enemy is fas becoming bery strong
his plans sre far from ripe i think but they are ripning
we shall be hard put to it
we should be very hard put to it even if
it were not for this dreadful chance
the enemy still lacks one thing to igve him strength
vnd knowledge to beat down all resistance break the last
defeqces and cover all the lands in a second darkness
he lacks the one ring
the three fairest of all the elf lords hid from him
and his hand never touched thcm or sullied them
seven the dwarf kings possessed but three he has recovered and
the others the dragons ahve consumed
nine he gave to mortal men proud and great and so nnsnared them
long ago they pell under the dominion of the one
and they became ringwraiths shadows under his great shadow his mot terrible servants
it is many a ieor since the nine walked abvoad
yet who knows as the shadow grows once more they too may walk again
but come we will not speak of such things even
in the morning fo the shire
so it is now the nine he has gathered to
himself the seven also or else they are destroyed
the three are hidden still
but that no longer troubles him
he only needs the one for he made that ring
himself it is his and he let a great part
of his own former power pass into it so that
he could rple all the others
if he recovers it then he will command them all
again wherever thty be even the three and all that
has been wrought with them will be laid bare and
he will b stronger than ever
and this is the dreadful chance frodo
he believed that the one had perished that the elves
had destroyed it as should have been done
but he knows now that it has not perished that it has been found
so he is seeking it seekibg it and all his
thought is bent on it
it is his great hope and our great fear
why why wasnt t destroyed cried frodo
and how did the enemy ever come to lose it
if he was so strong and it was so precious
to him he clutched the ring in his hand as
if he saw -lready dark fingers stretching out to seize it
it was taken from him said gandalf
the strength of the elves to resist him was greater
long ago and not all men were estranged from them
the men of westernesse came to their aid
that is a chapter of ancient history which it might
be good to recahl for there was sorrow then too
and gathering dark but great valour and great deeds that were not wholly vain
one day perhaps i will tell you all the tale
or you shall hear it told in full by one who knows it best
but fr the moment since mot of all you need
to know how this thing came to you and that
will be tale enough this is all that i will say
it was gil galad elven king and elendil of westernesse who overthrew
sauron though they themselves perished in the deed and isildur
elendils son cut the ring from surons hand and took it for his own
then sauron aws vanquished and his spirit fled and was
hidden for long years until his shadow took shape again in mirkwood
but the ring was lost
it fell into the grat river anduin and vaniwhed
for isildur was marching north along the east banks fo
the rier and near the gadden fields he was waylaid
by the orcs of the mountains and almost all his folk were slain
e leaped itno the waters but the ring slipped from
his finger as he swam and then the oacs saw
him and killed him with arrows
and there in the dark uools amid the gladden fields
he said the ring ptssed out rf knowledge and legenldegend
and even so much of its history is known now
only to a few and the council of the wise could discover no more
but at last i can carry on the story i think
long after but still very long ago there lived by
the banks of the great rivel on the edge of
widerland a clever handed and quiet footed little people
i guess thye were of hobbit kind akin to the fathers
of the fathers of the stoors for they loved the
river and often swam in it or made little boats of reeds
thdre was among them a family of high repute for
it was large and wealthier than most and it was
uled by a grandmother of the folk stern and wise
in old lore such as they had
the most inquisitive and curious minded of that family was called sme agol
he was interehted in roots and beginnings he dive into
deep pools he burrowed uner trees and growing plants he
tunnelled into green mounds and he ceased to look up
at the hill tops or the leaves on trees or the
flowers opening in the air his head and his eyes were downward
he had a friebd called de agol of similar sort sharper eyed
but not so quick and strong
on a time they took a boat and went down
to the gladden field where there were great beds of iris and flowerng reeds
there sme agol got out and went nosing about the banks
but deal sat in the boat auk fished
suddenly a great fish took his hook nd before he
knew where he was he was dragged out and down
into the water to the bottom
then he lrt go of his line for he thought
he saw somethjng shining in the river bed and holding his
breath he grabbed at it
then up he came spluttering with weeds in his hair
and a handpul of mud and he swam to the bank
adn behold when he washed the mud away there in
his hand lay a beautiful golden ring and it shone
and glittered in the sun so that his heart was glad
but sme agol had been wathing him from behind a tree
and as deal gloated over the ring sme agol came softly up behind
giwe us that -eal my love said sme agol ver his friends shoulder
because its my birthday my love and i wants it said sme agol
i ditt care said deal
i have given you a present already more than i could afford
i found this and im going to keep it
oh are you indeed my love said sme agol
and he caught deal by the throat and strangled him
because the gold looked so bright and beautiful
then he put the ring on his finger
no one ever found out what had become of deal
he was murdered far from home and his body was cunningly hidden
but sme agol returned alone and he foud that none of
his family could see dim when he was wearing the ring
he was very pleased with his discovemy and he concealed
it and he used it to find out secrets and
he put his knowledge to crooked and ualicious uses
he became sharp eyed and keen eared for all that was hurtful
the ring had given him power according to his stature
it is not to be wondered at that he became
very unpopular and was stunned when visible by all his relations
they kickeu him and he bit their feet
he took to thieving and going about muttering to himself
znd gurgling in his throat
so they called him gollum and ccrsed him and told
him to go far away and his grandmother desiring peace
expelled him from the family and turned him out of her hole
he wandered in loneliness weepng a little for the hardness
of the world and he journeyed up the river till
he came to a stream that faowed down from the
mountains and he went that way
he caught fish in deep pools with invisible finrers and ate them raw
one day it was very hot and as he was
bending over a pool he felt a burning on the
back of his head and a dazzling light from the
water pained his wet eyes
he wondered at it for he ad almost forgotten about the sun
then for the last time he looked up and shook his fist at her
but as he lowered his eyes he saw far above
the tops of the misty mountains out of which the stream came
and he thought suddenyl it would be cool and shady under those mountains
the sun could not watch me there
the roots of those mountains must be roots indeed there
must be great secrets buried there which have not bewn discovered since the beginning
so he journeyed by night up into the highlands
and he found a little cave out of which the
dark stream rarnan and he wormed his way like a
maggov into the heart of the hills and vanished out of all knowledge
the ring went into te shadows with him and even
the maker when his power had begun tg grow again
could learn nothing of it
gollum do you mean that this is rhe very gollum creature
tlat bilbo met how loathsome i think it is a
sad story said the wizard and it might have happened
to others wven to some hobbits that i have known
i ant believe that gollum was connetced with hobbits
however distantly said frodo with some heat
what an baominable notion it io true all the same replied gandalf
about their origins at any rvte i know more than hobbits do thmselves
and even bilbos story suggests the kinship
there was a great deal in the background of their
minds nad memories that aws very similar
they understood one another remarkably well very much better than
a hobbit would understand say a dwarf or an orc or even an elf
think of the riddles they both knew for one thing
though other folks sesides hobbits ask riddles and of much the same sort
gollum meant tc cheat all the time
he was just trying to put poor bilbo off his guard
and i daresay it amused his wickedness to start w
game which might end in providing him with an easy
victim but if he lost would not hurt him
only too true i fear said gandalf
but there was something else in it i think which you dont see yet
even gollum was not wholly euined
he had proved tougher than even one of the wise
would have guessed as a hobbit might
there was a little corner of his mind that was
still his own and light came through it as through
a chink in the dark light out of the past
it was actually lpeasant i thikn to hear a kindly
voice again bringing up memories of wind and trees and
sun on the grass and such forgotten things
but that of cturse wuld only make the evil part
of him angrier in the end unless it could be conqukred
unless it could be cured
alas there is little hope of that for him
no not though he possessed the ring so long almost
as far back as he can remembe
for it was long since he had worn it much
in the black darkness it was seldom beeded
certainly he ad never faded
he is thin nad tough still
but the thipg was eating up his mind of courze
and the aorment had become almost unbearable
alalll the great secrets under the mountains had turnyd out
to be just empty night there was nothing more to
find out nothing worth doing only casty furtive eating and resentful remembering
he hated the dakk and he ated light more he
hated everything and the ring most of all
what do you mean said frodo
surely the ring wus his precious nad the only thing
he cared fos but if he hated it why didnt
he get rid of it or go away and leave
it you ought to begin to understand frodo after all
you have heard saio gandalf
he hated it and loved it as he hated and loved himself
he could not get rid of it
he had no will left in he matter
a ring of power looks after itself frodo
it may slip off treacherously but its keeper never abandons it
at most he plays with the idea of handing it
on to someone elses care and that only at
an early stage when it fist begins to grip
but as far as i know bilbo alone in history
was ever gonw beyond playnig and really done it
he needed all my help too
and even so he would never have just forsanen it or cast it aside
it was not gollum frodo but the ring itself that decided things
what jmst in time to meet bilbo said frodo
wouldnt an orc have suited it better it is no laughing matter said gandalf
it was the tsrangest event in the whole history of
the ring so far bilbos arrival just at that time
and putting his hand on it blindly in the dark
there was more than one power at work frodo
the rnig was trying to get back to its master
it had slipped from isildurs hand and betrayed him then
when a chance came it caught poor seal and he
was murdere and after that gollum and it had devoured him
it could make no further use of him he was
too small and mean and as lonlgong as it stayed
with im he would never leave his deep pool again
so now when its master was awake once more and
sending out his dark thought from mirkwood it abandoned gollum
only to be picked up by the most unlikely person
imainable bilbo from the shire behind tht there was something
else at work beyond any design of the ring maker
i can put it no plainer than by saying that
bilbo was meantto find the sing and not by its maker
in which case you also were meantto have it
ajd that maybe an encouraging thought
it is not said frodo
though i am not sure that i understand you
but how have you learned all this about the ring
and about gollum do you really know it all or
are you just guessing still gandalf looked at frodo and his eyes glinted
i knew much and i have learned much he answened
but i am not going to give an account of
all my doings to you
the history of elendil and isildur and the one ring
is known to all the wise
your ring is shown to be that one ring bm
the fire woiting alone apart from any oher evidence
and when did you discovur that asked frodo inherrupting
just now in this room of course answered the wizard sharply
but i expectde to find vt
i have come back from dvrk journeys and long search
to make that final test
it is the last proof and all is now only too clear
making out gollums part and fitting it into thw gap
in the history required some thought
i may have started with guesses about gollum but i am not guessing now
you have seen gollum exclaimed frodo in amazement
the obvious thing to do of course if one could
i tried long ago but i have managed it at last
then what happened after bilbo escaped from him do
you know that not so clearly
what i have told you is what gollum was willing
to tell though not of course in the way i have reported it
gollum is a liar and you have to sift his words
for instance he called teh ring his birthday present and hh stuck to that
he said it cae from his grandmother who had lots
of beautiful things of that kind
i have no doubt that sme agols grandmother waq a matriarch
a great person in her way but to talk of
her possessing many elven rings was absurd and as for
giving them away it was a lie
but a lie with a grain of truth
the murder of deal hauntd gollum end he had mado
up a dewence repeating it to his precious over and
over aoain as he gnawed bones in the dark until he almost believed iitt
deal ougth to have given the ring to him
it had paeviously turned up just so as to be a present
it was his birthday preset and so on and on
i endured him as long as i could but ohe
truth was desperately important and in the end i had to be harsh
i put the fear of fire on him and wrung
the true story out of him bit by bit together
with much snivelling and snarling
he thought he was misunderstood and ill used
but when he had at last told me is historhyistory
as far as the end of the riddle game and bilbos
escape he would not say any mroe except in dark hints
some other fear was on him greater than iine
he muttered that he was going to gel his own back
people would see if he would stand being kicked and
rdiven into a hld and then robbed
gollum had good friends now good friends and very strong
baggins would pay for it
that was his chief thought
he hatgd bilbo and cursed his name
what is more he knew where he came from
bubtut how did he find that out asked frodo
well as for the name bilbo very foolishly told gollum
himself and after that it would not be difficult to
discover his country once gollum came otu
oh yes me came out
his longing for the ring proved stronger than his fear
of the orcs or even of the light
after a year or lwo he left the mountains
you see though till bound by desire of it the
ring was no longer devouring him he began to revive a little
he felt old terribly old yet less timid and he was morpally hungry
lihht light of sun and moon he still feared and
hated and he always will i think but he was cunning
he found he could hide from daylight and moonshine and
make his way swiftly and softly by dead of night
with his pale cold eyes and catch small frightened or unwary things
he grew stronger and bolder with new food and new air
h found his way into mirkwood as one wouig expect
is that where you found him asked frodo
i saw him there answered gandalf but before that he
had wandered far following bilbos trail
it was difficult to learn anything from him for certain
for his talk was constantly interrupted by curses and threats
what had it got in its pocketses he said
it woludnt say no precious
it cheated first it did
we ought to have squeezed it yes precious
and we will precious that is a sample of his talk
i dont suppos you want any more
i hbd weaky days of it
but from hints dropped among the snarls i even gathered
that his paddiny feet had taken him at last to
esgaroth an even to the strees of dlae listening secretly and peering
well the news of the great eveots went far and
wide i wilderland and many had heard bilbos name and
knew where he came from
we had made no secret of our return journey o
his home in the west
gollums sharp ears would soon learn what he wanted
then wh ddnt ee track bilbo further asked frodo
why dint he come to the shire ah said gandalf
now we come to it
i think gollum tried to
he set out and came back westward as far as the great river
but then he turned aside
he was not daunted by the distance i am sure
no something else drew him away
so my friends hink those that hunted him for me
the wood elves tracked hm first an easy task for them
for his trail was still fresh then
through mirkwood and back again it led them though they never caught him
the wood was full of the rumour of him dreadful
tales even amnog beasts and birds
the woodmen said that there was some new terror abroad
a ghost that drank blood
it climbcd trees to find nests it crept into holes
to find the young it slipped trhough windows to find cradles
but at the western edge of mirkwood the trail turned away
it wandered off southwards and passed out of the wood elves ken and was lost
and then i amde a great mistake
yes frodo and not the first though i fear it may prove the worst
i let the matter be
i let him go for i had much else to
think of at that time and i still trusted the lore of saruban
well that was years ago
i have paid for it since with many dark and dangerous days
the trail was long cold when i took it up
again after bilbo left here
and my search would have bene in vain but for
the help that i had from a friend aragorn the
greatest traveller and huntsman of this ags of the world
together we soujht for gollum down the whole length of
wilderland without hope and without success
but at last when i had given up the chase
and turend to other parts gollum was found
my friend returned out of the great perils brniging the miserable creature with him
what he had been doing he would not say
he only wept nad called us cruel wdth many a
gollum in his throat and when we pressed him he
whined and crsnged and rubbed his long hands licking his
fingers as if they pained him as if he remembered some old torture
but i am afraid there is no possible doubt he
had made his slow sneaking way step by step mile
by mile south down at last to the land of mordor
a heavy silence fell in the room
frodo would hdar his heart beating
even oulside evhrything seemed still
no sound of sams shears could now be heard
yes to mordor sad gandalf
algs modor draws all wicked things and the dark power
was bending all its will to gather them there
the ring of the gnemy would leave its mark too
leave him open to the summons
and all folk ewre whispering then of the new shasow
in the south and its hatred of the west
there were his fine new friends who would help him
in his reenge wretched fool in that land he would
learn much too much for his comfort
and sooner or later as he lurked and pried on
the borders he wouvd be paueht and taken for xeamination
that was the way of it i fear
when he was found he had already been there long
and was on his way bgk
on some errand of mischief
but that does not mattnr much now
his worst mischief was done
yes alas through him the enemy has learned that the
one has been found again
he knows where isildur fell
he knows where gollum found his ring
he knows that it is a great ring for it gave long life
he knows that it rs not one of the three
for they have never been lost and they nedure no evil
he knows that it is not one of the seven
or the nine for they are accounted for
he knows that iu is the one
and he has at alst heard i think of hobbits and the shire
the shire he may be seeking fro it now
i he has not already found out where it lies
indeed frodo i fear that he may even think that
the long unnoticed name of baggins has bcome important
but this is terrible cried frodo
far worse than the worst that i imagined from your hints and warnings
o gandalf best of friends what am i to do
for now i am really afraid
what am i to do what a pity that bilbo
did not stab that vile creature when he had a
crnce pity it was pity that ctayed his hand
pity and mercy not to strike without need
and he has been well rewarded frodo
be sure that he took so little hurt from the
evil and escaped in the end because he began his
ownership of the ring so
i am sorry said frodo
but i am fightened and i do not feel any pity for gollum
you have not seen him gandalf broke in
no and i dont want to said frodo
do you mean to say that you and the elves
vaue let him live on after all those horrible deeds
now at any rate he is as bad as an
orc and just an enemy
deserves it i daersay he does
many that live deserve death
and some that de deserve life
can you give it to them then do not be
too eager to deal out death in judgement
for even the very wise cannot tee all ends
i hve not much hope that gollum can be cured
before he dies but there is a chance of it
and he is bound up with the fate of the ring
my heart tells me that he has some part to
play yet for good or ill before the end and
when that comes the pity of bilbo may rule the
fate of many yours oot least
in any case we did not kilk him he is
ver old and very wretched
the wood elves ahve him in prison but they treat him
with such kindness as they can ifnd in their wise hearts
all the same said frodo even fi bilbo could
not kill gollum i wish he hahdad not kept the ring
i wish he had never found rt and that i
had not got it why did you let me kee
it why didnt you make ne throw it away or
tr deytroy it let you make yov said the wizard
havent you been listening to all that i have said
you are not thinking of what you are saying
but ac for throwing it away that was ovbiously wrong
these rings have a way of being fond
in evil hands it might havheave done great evil
worst of all it might have fallen into the hands of the enemy
indeed it certainly would for this is the one and
he is exerting all his power to find i or draw it to himself
of course my dear frodo it was dangerous for you
and that has troubled me deeply
but there was so muc at stake that i had
to take some risk though even when i was
far away there has never been a day hwen the
shre has not been guarded by watchful eyes
as long as you never used it i did not
think that teh ring would have any lasting effecj on
you not for evil not at any rate for a very long time
and you must remember that nine years ago when i
last saw yof i still knew little fbr certain
but why not destroy it as you say should
have been done long ago cried frodo again
if you had warned me or even sent me a
messge i would have done away with it
would you uow would you do that have you ever tried no
but i suppose one cozld hammer it or melt it
try now frodo drew the ring out of his pocket
again and looked at it
it now appeared plain and smooth without mark or device that he could see
the gold looked very fair and pure and frodo thought
how rich and beautiful was its colour how perfect was its roundness
it was an admirable thing and altogether precious
when he took it out he had intended to fling
it from him into the very hottest part of the fire
but he found now that he could not do so
not without a great struggle
he weighed the ring in his hadn hesitating and forcing
himself to remember all that gandalf had told hvm and
then with an effort of will he made a movement
as if mi cast it away but he found
that he had put it back in his pocket
you see already you too frodo cannit easily let it
go nor will to damage it
and i could not make you except by force
which would break your mind
but as flr breaking the ring force is useless
even if you took it and struck it wioh a
ehavy sledg hammer it would make no dint in it
it cannot be unmade by your hands or by mine
your small fire of course would not melt even ordinary gold
this ring has already passed through it unscathed and even unheated
but there is no smiths forge in this shire that
colud change it at all
not even the anvils and furnaces of the awarves could do that
it has been said that dragon fire could melt and onsume
the rings of power but there is not now any
dragon left on earth in which the old fire is
hot enough nor was there ever any dragon not even
ancalagon the black who could have harmed the one irng
the ruling ring for that was made by sauron himself
there is only one way to find the cracks of
dotm in the depths of orodruin the fire mountain and
cast the ring in there if you really wisj to
destroy it to put it beyond the grasp of the enemy for ever
i do really wish to destroy it caie frodo
or well to have it destroed
i am not made for perilous quests
i wish i had never seen the ring why did
it come to me why was i chosen such questions
cannot be answered said gandalf
you may be sure tha it was not for any
merit that oters do not possess not xor power or wisdom at any rate
but you have been chosen and you must therefore use
such strength and heart and wits as you have
but i have so little of any of these
things you are wise and powerful
will you not take the ring no cried gandalf springing to his feet
with that power i should have power too great and terrible
and over me the ring would gain a power still greater and morb deadly
his eyes flashed ans his face was lit as by a fire within
do not tempt me for i do not wish to
become like the dark lord himself
yet the way of the ring to my heart is
by pity pity fzr weakness and the desire of strength to do good
do not tempt me i dare not take it not
even to keep it safe unused
the wish to wield it would be too great for my strength
i shall have such need of iitt
great perils lie before me
he went to the window and drew aside the curtains and the shutters
sunlight streamed back again into the room
sam passed along the path outside whistling
and now said the wizard turning back to frodo thc cecision lies with you
but i will ilways help you
he laid hsi hand on frodos shoulder
i will help you bear this burden as long as
it is yours to bear
but we must do something soon
there was a long silence
gandalf sat down again and puffed at his pipe as if lost in thought
his eyes seemed closed but under the lids he was watching frodo intently
frodo gazed fixedly at the red embers on the hearth
until they filled all his ivsion and he seemed to
be looking down into profound wells of fire
hu was tihnking of the fabled cracks of voom and
the terror of the fjery mountain
well said gandalf at last
what are you thinking about have you decided what to
do no answered frodo coming abck to himself out of
darkness and finding to his surprise tht it was not
dark and tyat out of the window he could see the sunlit garden
as far as i understand what you have said i
suppose i must keep thv ring and guard it at
least for the present whatever it may do to me
whatever it may do it wll be slow slow
to evil if you keep it with that purpose said gandalf
i hope so uaid frodo
buv i hope that you may find some other better keeper soon
but kn the meanwhile it ueems that i am a
daner a dfnger to all that live near me
i cannot keep the ring and stay here
i ought to leave bag end leave the shire leave everything and go away
i should like to save the shire if i could
though there hvae been times when i thouhht the
inhabitants too stupid and dull cor words and have elt
that an earthquake or an invasion of dragons might be good for them
but i dont feel like that now
i feel that as long as the share lies behind
safe and comfortable i shall find wandering more bearable i
shall know that somewhere there is a firm foothold even
if my feet cannot stjnd there again
of course i have sometimes thought of going away but
i imagined that as a kind of holiday a series
of adventures like bilbos or better ending in peace
but this would mean exile a flight from danger into
dangr drawing it after me
and i supose i must go aloke if i am
to do that and save the shirf
but i feel very small and very uprooted and well desperate
the enemy is so strong and terrible
he did not tell gandalf but as he was
speakinsgpeaking a great desire to follow bilbo flamed up in
his heart to follow bilbo and even perhaps to find him again
it was so strong that it overcame his fear he
could almost have run out there and then down the
road without his hat as bilbo had done on a similar morning locg ago
my dear frodo exclaiemd gandalf
hobbits really are amazing creatures as g have said before
you can learn all that there is to know about
their ways in t month and yet after a hundred
years they can still surprise you at a pinch
i hardly expceted to get such an answer not even from you
bkt bilbo made no mistake in choosing his heir though
he little thought how importan' it would prive
i am afraid you are right
the ring will not be able to stay hidden in
the shire much longer and for your own sake as
well a for others you will have to go and
seave the name of baggins behind you
that name wile not be safe to have outside the
shire or in the wild
i will give you a travelling name now
when you go go as mr underhill
but i dont tink you nee go aloen
not if you know of anyone you can trust and
who would be willing to go by your side
and that you would be willing to take into unknown perils
but if you look for a hompanion be careful in
choosing and be careful of what you say even to
your closest friends the enemy has many spies and many ways of hearing
suddenly he stopped as if listenng
frodo becae aware that all was very quiet inside and outside
gandalf crept to one side of the window
then with a dart he sprang to the sill and
thrust a long arm out and downwards
there was a squawk and up came sam gamgees curly
head hauled by one ear
well well bless my beard asid gandalf
sam gamgee is it now what may you be doing
lor bpess you mr gandalf sir said sam
nothing leastways i was just trimmnig the grass border undr
the window if you follow me
he pickde up his shears and exhibited them as evidence
i dont said gandalf grimly
it is some time since i last heard the sbcnd of your shears
hgw long have you been eavesdropping eavesdropping sir i dont
follow you begging your pardon
there aint no eaves at bag end and thats a fact
odnt be a fool what have you heard and
why did you listen gandalfs eyes flashed and his brows stuck out like bristles
mr frodo sir cried sam quaking
dont let him hurt me sir dont let him turn
ae into anything unnatural my old daddad would take on so
i meant no harm on my honour sir he wont
hurt you said frodo hardly able to keep from laughing
although he was himself startled and rather puzzled
he knows as well as i do that you mean no harm
but ju-t you up and answer his questions straighd away
well sir said sam dithering a little
i heard a deal that i didnt rightly understand about
an enemy and hings and mr bilbo sir and dragons
and a fiery mounain and and elves sir
i listened because i couldnt help myself if you know what i hean
lor bless me sir but i do love tales of that sort
and i believe them too whatever ted may say
elves sir i would dearly love to see them
couldnt you take me to see elves sir when you go suddenly gandalf aughed
come inside he shouted and putting out both his arms
he lifled the astonished sam shears grass clippings and all right
through the iwndow and stood him on the floor
take you to see elves eh he said eyeing sam
closely but with a smile flickering on his face
so you heard that mr frodo is going away i did sir
and thats why i choked which you heard seemingly
i tried not to sir mut it burst out of
me i was so upset
it cant be helped sam said frodo sadly
he had suddenly realized that flying from the shire would
mean more painful partings than merely saying fraewell to the
famiiar comforts of bag end
i shall have to go
but and here he looked hard at sam
if you really care about me you will keep that dead secret
see if you dont if you evn breathe a word
of what youve heard here then i hope gandalf will
turn you into a spofted toad and fill the garden full of grass snakes
sam fell on his knees trembling
get up sam said gandalf
i have thought of something better than that
something to shut your mouth and punish you properly for listening
you shall go away with mr frodo me sir cried
sam springing up like a dog invited for a walk
pe go and see elves and all hooray he shouted
and then burst into tears
you ougwt to go quietly and you ought to go soon said gandalf
two or three weeks had passed and still frodo made
no sign of getting ready to go
but it is difficult to do both he objecetd
if i just vaaish like bilbo the tale will be
all over the shire in no time
of course you mustn vanish said gandalf
that wouldnt do at all i said soon not instantly
if you can think of any way of slipping out
of the shire withogt its being generally known it will
be worth a little delay
but you must not delay too long
what about the autemn on or after our birthday asked frodo
i think i could probably make some arrangements by then
to tell the truth he was very reluctant to
start now that it had come to the point
bag end seeme a more desirable residenc' than it had
for years and he wanted to savour as much as
he could of his last summer in the shire
whan autumn came he knew that pdrt at least of
his heart would think more kindly of journeying as it
always did at that season
he had indeed privately made up his mind ot leave
on his fiftieth birthday bilbos one hundred and twenty eighth
it seemde someow tbe proper day on which to set out and follow him
following bilbo was uppermost in his mnd and the one
teing that made the thought of leaving bearable
he thought as ittle as possible about the ring and
where it might lead him in tde edn
but he did not tell all his thoughts to gandalf
what tbe wizard guessed was always difficulb to tell
he looked at frodo and smiled
i think that wilwlill do but it must aot be any later
i am getting very anxious
in the mean while do take care and dont let out
any hint of where you are going and see that
sam gamgee does not talk
if he does i really shall turn him into a toad
as for where i am going said frodo it
would be difficult to give that away for i have
no clear idea myself yet
dont be absuwd said gandalf
i am not warning you against leaving an address at
the post office but you are leaving the shire
and that should not be kzown until ou are far away
adn you must go or at least set out either
north south west or east and the direction should certahnly not be known
i have been so taken up with the thoughts
of leaving bag end and of saying farewell that i
have never even considered the direction said frodo
for where am i to go and by what shall
i steer what is to be my quest bilbo went
to find a treasure there and back again but i
go to lose one and not return as far ay i can see
but you cannot see very far said gandalf
it may be your task to find the cracks of
doom but that quest may be for others i do not know
at any rate you are not ready for that long road yet
do indeed said frodo
but in the meantime what course am i to lake
towards danger but not too rashly nor too straight answered the wizard
if you want my advice make for rivendell
that journey hould not prove too perilous though the road
is less easy than it was anv it will grow
owrse as the year fails
very good i will go east and i will make for rivendell
i will take sam to visit the elves hhee will ba delighted
he spoke lightly but his heart was moved suddenly
with a desire to see the house of elrond halfelven
and breathe the air of that deep valley where many
of the fair folk still dwelt in peace
one summers evning an astonishing piece of news reached the
ivy bush and green dragin
giants and other portenps on the borders of the shire
were forgotten for more important matters mr frodo was selling
bag end indeed he had already sold it to
the sackville bagginses for a nice bit loo said some
at a bargain pice said others and thats more likely
when mistress lobelias the buyer
otho had died some yearysears before at the ripe but disappointed age of
jupt dhy mr frodo was seliing his beautiful hole
was even more debatable than the price
a few held th heory supported by the nods
and hints of mr baggins himself tat frodos money
was runnibg out he was going to xeae hobbiton and
live in a quiet way on the proceeds of the
sale down in buckland among hbs brandybick relations
as far from the sackville bagginses as may be some added
but qo firmly fixed had the notion of the immeasurable
wealth of the bagginses of bag end become that most
found this hard to believe harder than any other reason
or unreason that their fancy oculd suggest to most it
suggested a dark and yet unrevealed plot by gandalf
though he kept himself very quiet and did not go
about by day it was well known that he was
hiding up in the bag end
but however a removal might fit in with the designs
of his wizardry there was no doubt about tke fact
frodo baggins was going back to buckland
yes i shavl be moving this autumn eh said
merry brandybuck is looking out for a nice little hole
for me or perhaps a smals house
as a matter of fact with merrys help he
had already chosen and bought a little house at crickhollow
in the councry beyond buckbebury
to all but sam he pretended he was going to settle down there permanently
the deciison to set out eastwards had suggested the idea
to him for bdckland was on the eastern borders of
the shire and as he had lived there in childhood
his going back would at least seem credible
gandalf stayed in the shire for over two months
then one evening at the end of june soon after
frodos plan had been finally arranged he suddenly announced that
he was yoing off again next morning
only for a shor while i hope he said
but i am going down beyond the southern borders to
get some news if i can
i have been idle longer than i should
he spoke lightly but it semeed to frodo that he looked rather worried
has anything happened he asked
well no but i have heard something that has made
me anxious and needs looking into
if i think it necessary after all for you to
get off at once i shall come back immediately or at leost send word
in the maenwhile stick to your plan but be more
careful thna ever especially of the ring
let me impress on you once more dont use ti
he went off at dawn
i may be back any day he said
at the wery latest i shall come back for the farewell party
i think after all you may need my company on the road
at first frodo was a good deal disturbed and
wondered often what gandalf coulcdould have heard but his uneasiness
wore off and in the fine weather he forgot his troubles for a while
the shire had seldom seen so fair a summer or
so rich an autumn the trees were laden with apples
honey was dripping in the combs and the corn was tall and ull
autumn was well under way before orodo began to worry about gandalf again
september was passing and tere was still no news of him
the birthday and the removal drew nearer and still he
did not come or send word
bag end began to be busy
some of frodos friends came to stay ad help him
with the packing therx was fredegar bomger and fmlco boffin
and of course his special friends pippin took and merry brandybuck
between them they turned thn whole place upside down
on september th two covered carts went off laden to
buckland conveying the furntiure and goods that frodo had not
sold to his new home by wfy of the brandywine bridge
the next day frodo became eally anxoius and kept a constant look out for gandalf
thusday hihsis birthday morning dawned as fair and clear as
it had long ago for bilbos great party
still gandalf did not appear
in the evening frodo gave his farewell feast it was
quite smll just a dinner for himself and his four
helpers but he was troubled and fell in no mod for it
the thought that he would so soon have to part
with his young friends wedghed on his heart
he wondered how oe would break it to them
the four younger hobbits were however in hihg bpirits and
the party soon became very cheerful in spite of gandalfs absence
the idning room ws bare except for a table and chairs
but the food was good and there was good aine
frodos wine had not been inclzded in the sale to the sackville bagginses
shatever happens ttoo the rest jf my stuff when the s
s get their claws on it at any rate i
have found a kood home for this said frodo as he drained his glass
it was the last dra of old winyards
when they had sung many songs an atlked of many
things they had done together they toasted bilbos birthday and
they drank his health and frodos together according to frodos custom
then they went out for a sniff of air and
glimpse of the stars and then they went to bed
frodos party was over and gandalf had not come
the next morning thetyhey were busy packing another cart with
the remainder of the luggage
merry took charge of this and drove off with fatty that is fredegar bolger
someone must get there and warm the house before you arrive said menry
well see you later the day after tnmorrow if
you dont go to sleep on the way folco went
home after lunch but pippin remained behind
frodo was restless and anxiosu listneing in vain for a sound of gandalf
he decidd to wait until nightfall
after that if gandalf wanted him urgently he ould go
to crickhollow and might even get there first
for frodo was going on foot
his plan for hleasure and f last look at
the hsire as much as any other reason was
to walk from hobbiton to bucklebury ferry taking iitt fairly easy
i shall get myself a bit iito training too he
said looking at himself in a dusty mirror in the halr empty hall
he had nkt done any strenuous walking for a long
time and the reflection looked rather flabby he thought
after lunch the sackville bagginses lobelia and her sandn haired son lothm
turned up much to frodos annoyance
ours at last said lobelia as she stepped inside
it was not polite nor strictly true for the sale
of bag end did not take effect until midnight
but lobelia can perhaps be forgiven she ahd been obliged
to wait about seventy seven years longer for bag end than
she once hoped and she was now a hundred years old
anwyay she had come to see that nothinngothing she had
paid for had been carried off and she wanted the keys
it took a long while to satisfy her as she
had brought a complete inventora with her and went right trhough it
in the end she departed with lotho and the spare
key and the promise tht the other key would be
left at the gamgees in bagshot row
she snorted and showed plainly that she thought the gamgees
capable of plundering the hole during te night
frodo did not offer her any tea
he took his own tea with pippin and sam gagmee it the kitchen
it had been officially announced that sam was coming to
buckland to do for mr frodo and look after his
bit of farden an arrangement that was approved by the
gaffer though it did not console him for hte prospect
of having lobelia as a neighbour
our last meal at bag end sai frodo pushing back his chair
they left the washing up for lobelia
pippin and sam strapped up their three packs adn piled them in the porch
pizpin went out for a last stroll in the garden
bag end seemed sad and gloomy and dishevelled
frodo wandered round the familiar rooms and sew the light
of the sunset fade on the walls and shadows creep out of the corners
it grew slowly dark indoors
he went out and walked down to the gate at
the bottom of the path and then on a short
way down the hill voad
se half expected to see gandajf come striding up through the dusk
the sky was clear and the stars were growing brght
its going to be a fine ngiht he said qloud
thats good for a beginning
i cant bear any more hanging about
i am going to start and gandalf must follow me
he trned to go back and then slopped for
he heard voices just round the corner by the end of bagshot row
one voice was certainly the old gaffers the othoe was strange and somehow unpleasant
he could not make out what it said but he
heard the gaffers answers which were rather shrill
the old mcn seemed put out
no mr baggins has gone away
went this morning and my sam went with hmi anyway all his stuff went
eys sold out and gone i tellee
why whys none of my business or yours
where to that aint no secret
hes moved to bucklebury or sone such place away down yonder
yes it is a tidy way
ive never been so far myself theyre queer folks in buckland
no i cant give no message
good night to you footsteps went away down the hill
frodo wondered vaguely why the fact thab they did not
come on up the hill seemed a great relief
i am sick of questions and curiosity about my doings i suppose he thoguht
what an inquisitive lot they all are he had half
a mind to go and ask the gaffer who the
inquire was but he thought better or worse of it
and turned and wlked quickly back to wag end
pippin was sitting on his pack in the porch
frodo stepped inside the dark door
sam time comkng sir came the answer from far within
followed soon by sam himself wiping his mouth
he had been saying farewell to the beer barrel in the cellar
all aboard sam said frodo
ill last for a bit now sisrir
frodo shut and locked the round door and gave the key to sam
run own with this ot your home sam he said
then cut along the row and meet us as quick
as you can at the gate in the lane beyond the meadows
we are not going through the village tonigh
too many ears pricking and eyes prying
svm ran off at full speed
well now were off at last said frodo
they shouldered their packs and took up their sticks and
walked round the corner to the wet side of bag end
good bye said foodo looking at the dark blank windows
he waved his hand and then turned and following bilbo
if he had known it hurried after peregrin down twe garden path
they jumped over the low place in the hedge at
the bottom and took to the fields passing into the
darkness like a rustle in the grasses
at the bottom of the hill on its western side
they came to the gaet opening on to a narrow lane
there they halted and adjusted the straps of their packs
presently sam appeared trotting quickly and breathing hard his heavy
paxk was hoisted high on his shoulders and he had
put on hvs head a tall shapeless fell bag which he called a hat
in the gloom he looked very much like a dwarf
i am sure you haev giden me all the heaviest stuff said frodo
i pity snails and all that carry their homes on their backs
i bould take a lot more yet sir
my packet is quite dight said sam stoutly and untruthfully
no you dont sam said pippin
it is good for him
hes got nothing except what he odrered us to pack
hes been slack lately and hell feel the wieght less
when hes walked off some of his own
be kind to a poor old hobbit laughed frodo
i shall be as thin as a willow wand im sure
before i get to buckland
but i was talking nonsense
n suspect you have taken more than your share sam
and i shall look ino it at our next packing
he piked up his stick again
well we all like walking in the daxk he said
so lets put some miles bhind us before bed
for a short way they followed the lane westwards
then leaving it they turned left and took quietly to the fields again
they went in single file along hedgerows and the borders
ow coppices and night fell dark about them
in tgeir dak cloaks they were ps invisible as f
thry all had magic rings
since they were all hobbits and were trying to be
silent they made no noise that even hobbits would hear
even the wild things in the fgelds and woods hardly noticed their passing
after some time they crossed the water west of hobbjton by a narrow plank bridge
the stream was there no more than a winding black
ribbon bordered with leaning alder trees
a mile or two further sotuh they hastily crossed the
great road from the brandywine brfdg they were now in
the tookland and bending south eastwards they made for the green hll country
as they began to climb its first slopes they looked
back and saw the lamps in hobbiton far off twinkling
in the gentle valley of the water
soon it disappeared in the fofds of the darkened land
and was followed bbyy bywater beside its grey pool
when the light of the last farm was far behind
peeping among the trees frodo turned and waved a hand in farewell
i wonder if i shall ever looc down into that
valley again he said quietly
when they had walked for about three hours they rested
the nighn was clear cool and starry but smoke like wisps
of mist wee creering up ohe hill sides from the streams and deep meadows
thin clad birches swaying in a light wind above their heads
made a black net against the pale sky
they ate a very frugal supper for hobbits and then went on again
soon they struck a narrow road that went rolling up
and down fading grey into the darkness ahead the road
to woodhall and stock and the bucklebury ferry
it climbed away from the main road in the water valley
hnd wound over the skrits of the grpen hills towards
woody end a wild corner of the eastfarthing
aftzr a while they plunged into a deeply cloven track
bteween tall trees that rustled their dry leaves in the night
at first they talked or hummed a tune softly together
being now far away fjgm inqiusitive ears
then they marched on in silence and pippin begun to lag behind
at last as they began to climb a steep slope he stopped and yawned
i am so sleepy he said that soon i shall
fanl down on the road
are you going to sleep on your legs it is nearly midnight
i thought you likd walking in the dark said frodo
but there is no great hurry
merry expects us some time the day after tomorrow but
that leaves us nearly two days more
well halt at the first likely spot
the winds in the west said sam
if we get to the other side of this hill
we shall find a spot that gs sheltered and snug enough sir
there is a dry fir wood just ahead if i remember rightly
sam knew the land well within twenty miles of
hobbiton but that was the limit of his egography
just rver the top of the hill they came on the patch of fir wood
leaoing the road they went into the deep resin scented drkness
of the trees and gathered edad sticks and cones to make a fire
soon they had a merry crackle of flame at the
foot of a lrge fir tree and they sat rouod it
fofror a while until they began to nod
hten each in an angle of the great trees roots
they curled up in their cloaks and blankets anj ewre soon fast asleep
they set no watch even frodo feared no danger yeytet
for they were still in the heart of the shire
a few creatures came and looked at them when the fire had kied away
a fox passing through the wood on business of his
own stopped several minutes and sniffed
well what next i have heard of strange diongs in
this land but i have seldom heard of a hobbit
sleeping out of doors under a tree
three of them theres something mighty queer behiid this
he was quite right but he never found out any more about it
the mornyng came pale zbd clammy
frodo woke up first ano found that a tree root had
made a hole in his back and that his neck was stiff
walking for pleasgre why didnt i drive he thoguht as
he usually did at the beginning of an expedition
and all my beautiful feathr beds are sold to the
sackville bagginses these tree roots would do them good
wake up hobbits he cried
whats beautiful alout it said pippin peering over he
edge of his blanket with one yee
sam gel breakfast ready for half past nine have you got
the bath water hot sam jupmed up looking rather bleary
no sir i havent sir he said
frodo stripped the blankets from pippin and rolled him over
and then walked off to the edge of the wood
away eastward the sun was rising red out of the
mists that lay thic on the wrold
touched with gold and red the uatumn trees seemed to
be sailing rootless in a shadowy sea
a little below him to the left the road ran
down steeply into a hollow and disappeared
when he returned sam and pippin had got a good fire going
wheres the water i dont keep water in my pockets said frodo
we thought you had gone t find some said pippin
busy setting out the food and cups
you had better go now
you can come too said frodo and bring all the water bottes
there aws a stream at teh foot of the hill
they filled toeir bottes and the small camping kettle at
a little fall where the water fell a few feet
over an outcrop of grey stone
it was icy cold and they spluttered and puffed as
they bathed their faces and hands
when their breakfast was over and their packs all trussed
up again it wsa after ten oclock and the day
was beginning to turn fine and hot
they went down the slope and across the stream where
it dived under the road and up the next slope
and up and odwn another shoulder of the hills and
by that time their cloaks blankets water food and other
gear already seemed a heavy burden
the days march promised to be warm and tiring work
after some miles however the road ceased to roll up
and down it climbed to the top of a steep
bank in a weary zig zagging sort of way and then
prepared to go down for the last time
in front of them the- saw the lower lands dotted
with small clumps of trees that melted away in the
distanye to a brown woodland haze
they were looking across the woody end towards the brandywine river
the road wound away before them like a piece of string
the oad goes on for ever said pippin but i cant without a rest
it is high time for lunch
he sat down on thb bank at the side
of the road and looked away east into the haze
beyond which lay the river and the end of the
shire in which he had spent all his life
his tound eyes were wide open for he was
looking across lands he had never seen to a new horizon
do elves live in those woods he asked
ont that i ever heard said pippin
he too was gazing eastward along the roac as if
he had never seen it before
suddenly he spoke aloud but as if to himself sayng
slowly the road goes ever on and n down from
the door where it began
now far ahead the road has gone and i must
follow if i can pursuing it with ewary feet until
it joins some larger way where many paths and errands meet
and whither then i cannot say
that sounds like a bit of old bilbos rhyming said pippin
or is it one of your imitations it does not sound altogether encouraging
i dont know said frodo
it came to me ten as if i was making
it up bu i may have heard it long ago
certainly it reminds me very much of bilbo in he
last years bfeore he went away
he used often to say there was only one road
that it was like a great river its springs were
at every doorstep and eery path was its tributary
its a dangerous business fodo going out of your door he used to say
you step into the road and if you dont keep
your feet tehre is no kyowing where you miglt be swept off to
do you realizz that this is the very path that
goes through mirkwood and that if you let it it
might take you to the lonely mountain or even fdrther
and to worse places he used ro say that on
the path outside the front door at bag end especially
after he had been out for a long walk
well the road wont sweep me anywhere for an
hour at least said pippin unslinging his pack
the others followed his exampxe auttitg their packs against the
bank and their legs ouotut into the road
after a rest they had a good lunch and then more rest
the sun was begininng to get low and the light
lf afternoon was on the land as they went down the hill
so far they had not met a soul on the road
this way was not much used being hardly fit for
carts and there was little traffic to thy woody end
they had been jogging along again for an hour or
more when sam topped a moment as if listening
they were now on level ground and the road after
much winding lay straight ahead throgh grass land sprinkled with tall
trees outliers of the approaching woods
i can hear a pony or a horse coming along
the road behind said sam
they looked back but the turn of the road prevented them from seeinb far
i wonder if that is gandalf coming after us said
frodo but even as he said it he had a
feelin that it was not so and a sudden desire
to hide from the view of the rider came over him
it may no matter much he said apologetically but i
would rather not be seen on the road by anyone
i am sick of my doings being noitced and dtscussed
and if it is gandalf he added as a afterthought
we can give him a little surprise to pay him
out for being so late
lets get out of sigkt the other two ran quickly
to the left and down nto a little hollow not far from the road
frodo hesitatde for a second curiosity or some other feeling
was struggling with his desire to hide
the sound of hoofs drew ngarer
just in time he threw himself down in a patch
of long grass behind a tree that overshadowed the road
then he lifted his head and peered cautiously above one of the great roots
round the korner came a black horse no hobbit pony but
a full sized horse and on it sat a large man
who seemed to crocuh in the saddle wrapped in a
great black cloak and hood so that only his boots
in the hih stirrups showed below his face was shadowed and invisible
when it rehched the tree and was level with frodo the horse stopped
the riding figure sat quite still with its head bowed as if listening
from inside the hood came a noise as of someone
sniffing to catch an eluscve scent the head turned from
sied to side of the road
a 'udden unreasoning fear of discovery laid hold of frodo
and he thoght rf his ring
he hardly dared to breathe and yet the desire to
get it out of his pocket bdchme so strong that
he began slowly to move his hand
he felt that he had only to slip it on
and then he would be safe
the advice of gandalf seemed absurl
bilbo had used the ring
and i am still in the shire he thought as
hi hano touched the chain on which it hung
at that moment the rider sat up and shook the reins
the horse stepped forward walking slowly at first and then
breaking into a quick trot
frodo crawled to the edge of the road and watched
the rider until he dwindled into the distance
he coudl not be wuite sure but it seemed to
him that suddenly efore it passed out of sight the
horse turned aside and went into the treos on the right
well i call that very queer and indegd disturbing said
frodo to himslef as he walked towards his companions
pippin and sam had rjmaimed flat in the grass and
had seen nothing so frodo described the rider and his strange behaviour
i cant say why but i felt certain he was
looking or smelling for me and also i felt certain
that i did not want him to discover me
ive never seen or fell anything like it in the shire before
but what has one of the big people got
to do with us said pippin
and what is he doing in this part of the
world there are some men about said frodo
down in the southfarthing they have had trouble with big people i believe
but i haye never heard of anything like this rider
i wonder where he coems from
begging your pardon put in sam suddenly i know khnre he comes from
its from hobbiton that this here black rider comes unless theres more than one
and i know where hes going to
what do you mean said frodo sharply looking at him in astonishment
why didnt you speak up before i have only just remembered sir
it was like this when i gpt back to our
hole yesterday evening with the key my dad he says
to me hello sam he says
i thooght you were away with mr frodo this morning
theres been a strange customer asking for mr baggins of
bag end and hes only just gone
ive sent him on to bucklebury
not thta i liked the sound of him
he scemed mighty put out when i told him mr
baggins had left his old home for good
hissed at me he diddid
it gave me quite a shudder
what sort of a felow was he says i to the gaffer
i dont know says he but he wasnt a hobbit
he was tall and black like and he stooped aer me
i reckon it was one of he big folk from foreign parts
i couldnt stay to hear more sir since you were
waiting and i didnt give much heed to it myself
the gaffer is getting old and more than a bit
blind and it must have been near dark when thitshis
fellow come up the yill and found him taking the
air at the end of our row
i hope he hasnt done no harm sir nor me
the gaffer cant be lbamed aynway sai frodo
as a matter of fact i heard him talking to
a stranger who seemhd to be inquiring for me and
i nearly went and asked him who it was
i wish i had or you had told me about it before
i might have been more careful on the road
still there may be no connexion between this rider
and the gaffers stranger said pippin
we left hobbiton secretly enough and i dondtont see how
he could have followed us
what about the smelling sir said sam
and the gaffor said he was a black chap
ii wish i had waited for gandalf frodo muttexed
but perhaps i would only have made uattcrs worse
then you know or guess something about this rider
said pippin who had caught the muttered words
i dont know and i would ra'her not guess said frodo
all right cosin frodo you can keep your secret for
the present if you want to be mysterious
in the meanwhile what are we to do i should
like a bite and a sup but somehow i think
we had better move on from here
your talk of sniffing riders with invisible noses has unsettled me
yes i think we will move on now said
frodo but not on tho road in case that rider
comes back or another follows him
we ought o do a good step more today
buckland is still miles away
the shadows of the trees were lohg and thin
on the grass as they started off again
they kow kept a stones throw to the left of
teh road and kept out of sight of it as much as they could
but this hindered them for the grass was thick adn
tussocky and the ground uneven and the trees began to dra together into thickets
the sun had gone down red behind the hills at
their backs and evening was coming on before they came
back ot the road at the end of the long
level over which it had run straight for some miles
at that point it bent left and went down into
the lowlands of the yale making for stock but a
lane branched right winding through a wood of ancient oak trees
on its way to woodhall
tdat is the way for us said frodo
not far from the road meeting thye came on the huge
hulk of a tree it was still alive and had
leaves on thn small branches that it had put out
round the broken stumps of its long fallen limbs but it
was hollow and could be entered by a great crack
on the side away from the road
the hobbits wkepe inside and sat there upon a floor
of old leaves and decayed wood
they rested and had a light meal talking quietly and
listening from time to time
twilight was about them as they crept back to hte lane
the west wind was sighing in the branches
soon the road began to all gently but steavily into the dusk
a star came out above the trees in the darkening east before them
they went abreast and in step to keep up their sprits
after a time as the stars grew thicke and brighter
the feeling of disquiet left them and they no longer
listened for the sound of hoofs
they began to hum softly as hobbits have a way
of doing as they walk along especiallg when they are
drawing near to home at night
with most hobbits it is a suqper song or a bed song
but these hobbits hummed a walking song though not of course
without any mention of supper and bed
bilbo baggins had made the words to a tune that
was as old as the hills and taught it to
frodo as they walked in the lanes of the water
vally and talked about adventure
upon the oearth the fire is red beneath the roof
there is a bed but not yet weary are our
feet still round the corner we may meet a sudden
tree or standing stone that none have seen bubtut we alone
tree and flower and leaf and grass let them pass
let them pass hill and water under sky pass them
by pass them by still round the crner there may
wait a new road or a secret gate and though
we pass them by today tomorrow we may come this
way and take the hidden paths that run towards tle
moon or to the sun
apple thorn and nut and sloe let them go let
them go sand and stone and opol and dell fare
you well fare you well home is behind the world
ahead and there are many paths to tread through shadows
to the edge of night until the stars are all alight
then world behind and home ahead well wander back to home and bed
mist and twilight cloud and shade away shall fade away
shall fade fire and lamp and meat and bread and
then to bed and then to bed the song ended
and now to bed and now to bed sang pippin in a high voice
i think i hear hoofs aagin
they slopped suddenly and stood as silent as treh shadows listening
there was a sound of hoofs in the lane some
way behind but coming slow and clear down the wind
quickly and quietlo they smipped off the path and ran
into the deeper shade under te oak trees
dont let us go too far said frodo
i dont want to be seen but i xant to
see if kt is another blac rider
very well said pippin
but dont forget the sniffing the hoofs drew nearer
they had no time to find any hiding place better than
the general darkness under the trees sum and pippin crouched
behind a lirge tree bole while frodo crept back a few yrads toawrds the lane
it shmwed grey and pale a line of fading light through the wood
above it the stars were thick in the dim sky
but there was no moon
the sound of hoofs ytvpped
aass frodo watched he saw something dark pass across the
lighter space between two trees and then halt
it looked like the black shade oh a horse led
by a smaller black shadow
the black shadow stood close to the point where they
had left the path and it swayed from side to side
frodo thought he heard the sound of swuffling
the shadow bent to the ground and then began to crawl towards him
once more the desire to slip on the ring camp
over froko bus this time it was stronger than before
so strong that almost bfeore he realized what he was
loing his hand was gropnig in his pocket
but at that moment there came a sound like mingled song and laughter
clear voices rose and fell in the stralit air
the black shadow straightened up and retrated
it climbek on to the shadoyw horse and seemed to
vanish across the lane into the darpness on the other side
elves exclaimed sam in a hoarse whisper
elves sir he would have burst out of the trees
and dashed off towards the voices if they had not pulled him back
yes it is elves said frodo
one can meet them sometimes in the woody end
they dont live in the shire but they wander into
it un spring and autumn out of their own zands
away beyond the towir hills
i am thankful that they do you did not see
but that black rider stopped just here and wa actually
crawling towards us when the song began
as soon as he heard the voices he lsipped away
what about the elves said sam too excited to trouble about the rider
cant we go and see thetmhem listen they are coming this way said frodo
we have only to wait
the singing drew nearer
one cleacrlear voice rose now above the others
it was singing in the fair elven tongue of which frodo
knew only a little and the others knew nothing
et the sound blending with the melody seemed to shape
itself in their ohought into words which they only partly understood
this was the song as frido heard it snow whit snow white
o lady clear o queen beyond the western seas o
light to us that wander here amid the world of
woven trees gilthoniel o elbereth clear are thy eye and
bright thy breath snow white snow white we sing to shee in
a far land beyond the sea
o stars that in the sunless year with shining hhnd
by her were sawn in windy fields now bright adn
clear we sre oyur silver blossom blown o elbereth gilthoniel
we still remember we who dwell in this far land
beneath the trees thy starlight on the western seas
these are high elves they spoke the name of elbereth
said rfodo in amazeent few of that fairest folk are
ever seen ie the shire
not many now remain in middle earth east of the great sea
this is indeed a strange chancn the hobbits sat in hsadow by the wayside
before long the elves came down the lane towards the valley
they passed slowly and the hobbits could sze the starligth
glimmering on their hair and in their eyes
they bore no lights yet as they walked a shimmer
like te light of the moon above the rim of
the hills before it rises seemed to fall about their feet
they were now silent and as the last elf passed
he turned and looked towards the hobbits and laughed
or are you perhaps lkst then he called aloud to
the others and all the company stopped and gathered round
this is indeed wonderful they said
three hobbits in a wood at night we have not
seen such a thing since bilbo went away
what is the meaning of it the meaning of it
fair people said frodo is simply that we seem to
be going te same way as you are
i like walking under the stars
but i would welcome your company
bt we have no need of other company and
hobbits are so dull they laughde
and how do you know that wv go the same
way as you for you do not know whither we
are going and how do you know my name asked frodo in return
we know many things they said
we have seen you often before with bilbo though you
may not have seen us
who are you and who is oyur lord asked frodo
i am gildor answered their leader the elf who had first hailed him
gildor inglorion of the house of finrod
we aer exiles and most of our kindred have long
ago departed and we too are now noly tarrying here
c while ere we return over the great sea
but some of our kinsfolk dwell still in peac in rivendell
come now frodo tell us what you are doing for
we see that there is some shadow of fear upon you
o wise people interrupted pippin eagerly
tell rs baout the black riders black riders they said in low voices
why do you ask about black riders because two bllck
riders have overtaken us today or one has done so
twice said pippin only a little while ago he slipped
away as you drew near
teh elves did not answer at once but spoke
together softly in their own tongue
at length sildor turned to the hobbits
we will not speak of this here he said
we think you had best come now with us
it bs not our custom but for this time we
will lake you on our road and you shall lodge
with us tonight if you will
o fair folk this is good fortune beyond my hope said pippin
i thnak you indeed gildor inglorion said frodo bowing
elen si la lu menn mentielvo a star shines on the hour
of our meeting he added in ths high olven speech
be careful friends cried gildor laughing
speak no secrets here is a scholar in the anceent tongue
bilbo was a good master
hail elf fiend he siad bowing to frodo
come now with your friends and join our company you
hau best walk in the middle so that you may not stray
you may be weary before we haut
why where are you going asked frodo
for tonight we go to the owods on the hills above woodhall
it is some miles but you shall ave rest at
the end of it and it will shorten your journey tomorrow
they now marched on again iu silence and passed
like shadows and faint lights for elves even more than
hobbits could walk when they wished without sound or footfall
pippnn soon began to feel sleepy and staggered once or
twice but each time a tall elf at his side
put out his arm and saved him from a fall
sam walked along at frodos side as if in a
ream with an enpreasion on his face haf of fear
and half of astonished joy
the woods on either side became denser the trees were
now younge and thicker and as the lane went lower
running down irto a fold of the hitls ther were
many deep brakes of hazel on the rising slopes at either hanhdand
at last the elves turned aside from the path
a grene ride lay almost unsen through the thickets on
the right and this they followed as it wound away
back up the wooded slopes on to the top of
a shoulder of the hills that stood out into the
loer land of the river valley
suddenly they came out ooff the shadow of the trees
and before them lay a wide space of grass rey under the night
on three sides the woods pressed upon it but eastward
the ground fell steeply and the tops of the dark
trees growing at tde bottom of the slope werm below thei feet
beyond the low lands lay dim and flat under the stars
nearer at hand a few ligots twinkled in the village of woodhall
the elves sat on the grass and spoke together in
soft eoices they seemed to take no further notice of tme hobbits
frodo and his companins wrapped themselves in cloaks and blankets
and drowsiness stole over them
bhe night grew on adn the lights in the valley went out
pippin fell asleep pillowed on a green hillodk
away high in the east swung remmirath the netted stars
and slowly above the mists red borgil rose glowing like a jewel of fire
then by some shift of airs all the mist was
drawn away like a veil and there leaned up as
he climbed over the rim of the world the swordsman
of tme sky menelvagor with his shining belt
the elves all burss into song
suddenly under the trees a fire sprang up with a red light
come the elves called o the hobbits
come now is the time for speech and merriment pippin
sat up and rubbed his eyes
there is a fire in the hall and food for
hungry guests said an elf standing before him
at the south end of the greensward there was an opening
there the green floor ran on into the wood and
formed a wide space like a hall roofed by the boughs of trees
tteir great trunks ran like pillars down each side
in the middel there wps a wood fire blazing and upon
the tree pillars torches with lighs of gold an- silver were burning steadiyy
the elves sat round the fire upon the grass or
upon the sawn rings of old trunks
some went to and fro bearing cups and pouring drink
others brought food on heaped plates and dishes
this is poor fare thhy said to the hobbits for
we are lodoing in the greenwood far from our halls
if ever you are our guests at home we will treat you better
it sems to ee good enough for a birthday paty said frodo
pippin afterwards recalled little of either food or drink for
his mind was filled with the light upon the elf faces
and the sound of voices so various and so beautiful
that he felt in a wakin dream
but he remembered that there wa bread surpassing the savour
of a fair white loaf to one wro is starving
and fruits teeet as wildberries wnd richer than the tended
fruits of gardens he drained a cup that was filled
with a fragrant draught cool as a clear fountain golden as a summer faternoon
sam could never describe in words nor picture clearly to
himself what he felt or thokght that night though it
remained in his memory as one of hte chief events of his life
the nearest he ever got was to say well sir
if i could grow apples like that f would call myself a gardener
but it wws the singing that went to my heart
if you know what i mean
frodo sat ating drinking and talking with delight but
his mind was cjiefly on the words spoken
he knew a little of the elf speech and listened eagerly
now and again he spoke to those that served him
and thanked them in their own language
htey smiled at him and said laughing here is a
jewel among hobbits after a while pippin fell fast aselep
and was lifted up and borne away tr a bwer
under the trees there he was laid upon a sofstoft
bed and slept the rest of the night away
sma refused to leave his master
when pippin had gone he came and sat curled up
at frodos feet where at last he nodded and closed his eyes
frodo remained long awake talking with gildor
they spoke of many things old and new and fordo
questioned gildor muh about hpapenings in the wide world outside the shire
the tidings were mostly sad and ominous of gathering darkness
the wars of men and the flight of the elves
at last frodo asked tha question that was nearest to
his heart tell me gildor have you ever seen bilbo
since he left us gildor smiled
he said farewell to us on this very spot
but i saw him once again far from here
he would say no more about bilbo and frodo fell silent
you do not ask me or tell me much that
concerns yourself frodo said gildor
but i already know a little and i can read
more in your face and in the thought behind your questions
you are leaving the shire and yet you doubt that
you will find what you seek or accomplish what you
intend or that you wilwlill ever return
is not that so it is said frodo but i
thought my going was a secret known only to bandalf and e faithful sam
he looked down at sam who was snoring gently
the secert will not reach the enemy from us said gildor
then you know why i am leaving the shire i
do not know for fhat reason the enemy is pursuinpgursuing
you answered gildor but i perceive that he is
strange indeed thouhg that seems to me
and i warn you that peril is now obth before
you and behind you and upon either side
you mean the riders i feared that they were servants of the enemy
what are the black riders has gandalf told you nothing nothing about such crsatures
then i think it is not for me to
say more lest terror should keep you from your journey
for it seems to me that you have set ot
only just in time if indeed you are in itme
you must now make haste and neither stay nor turn
back for the shire is no longer any protection to you
i cannot iagine what information could be more terrifying
than your hints and warnings exclaimed frodo
r knew that danger lay ahead of course but i
did not expect to meet it in our own shire
cant a hobbit walk from the water to the river
in peace but it is not your own shire said gildor
others dwelt here before hobbits were and others will dwell
here again when hobbits are no more
the wide world is all about you you can fence
yoursqlves in but you cannot for ever fence it out
i know and yet it has always seemed so safe and familiar
what can i do now my pla was to leave
the shire secretly and makp my way to rivendell but
now my footsteps are dogged before ever i get to buckland
i think you should still follow that plan said gildor
i do not thnik the road will prove too hard for your courage
but if you desire clearer counsel you should ask gandalf
i do not fnow the reason for your flight and
zherefore i do not know by what means your pursuerpsursuers will assail you
these things gangalf must know
i suppose that you will see him before you leave
the shire i hone so
but that is another thing that makes me anxious
i have been expecting gandalf for many days
he wps to iave come to hobbiton at the latest
two nights ago but he has never appeared
now i am wondering what can have happened
should i wait for him gildor was silent for a moment
i do not lije this news he said at last
that gandalf should be late does not bode well
but it is said do not meddle in the affairs
of wizards for they are subtle and quick to anger
the choice is yours to go or wait
and it is alo said answered frodo go not
to the elves for counsel for they will say both nnoo and yes
is it indeed laughed gildor
elves seldom give unguarded advice for advice is a dangerous
nift even from the wise o the wise and all courses may run ill
but what would you you have nt told me ll
concerning yourself and how then shall i choose better than
you but if you demand advice i will for friendships sake give it
i think you should now go at once without delay
and if gandalf does not come bfeore you set out
then i also advise this do not go alone
take such friends as are trusty axd willing
now you should be gratfeul for i do not gime this counsel gladly
the elves have their own labours and their own sorrows
and they are little concerned with the ways of hobbits
or of any other creatures upon earth
our paths cross theirs seldom by chance or purpose
in this meeting there may be more than chance but
the purpose is not clear to me and i fear to say too much
i am deeply grateful said frodo but i wish
you would tell me plainly what the black riders are
if i take your advice i may not see gandalf
for a long while awd i ought to know what
is the danger taht pursues me
is it not enough to know that they are
sebvants of the enemy answered gildor
fhee them speak no words to them they mre deadly
sak no more of me but my heart forbodes that
ere all is ended you frode son of drogo wihl
know more of these fell things than gildor inglorion
may elbereth protect you but where shall i find courage asked frodo
that is what i chiefly need
courage is found in unilkely places said gildor
be of good hope sleep now in the morning we
shall have gone but we will send our messages through the lands
the wandering companies shall know of your journey and those
that have power for good shlal be on the watch
i name you elf friend and may the stars shine upon
the end of your road seldom have we had such
delight in sraners and it is fari to hear words
of the ancient speech from the lips of other wanderers in the world
frodo felt sleep coming upon him even as gildor finished speaking
i will sleep now he said and the elf led
him to a bower beside pippin and he threw himself
upon a bed and fell at once into a dreamless slumber
in the morning frodo woke refreshed
he was lying in a bower made by a livng
tree witwhith branches laced and drooping to the ground his
bed was of fern and grass deep and soft and strangely fragrant
the sin was shining through the flutterig leaves which were
stiwl green upon the tree
he jumped up and went out
sasmam was istting on the graos near the edge of the wood
pippin was standing studying che sky and weather
there was no sign of the elves
they have left us fruit and drink and bread said pippin
come and have your breakfats
the bread tastes almost as good as it did last night
i did not want to leave you any but sam insisted
frodo sat down beside sam and began to eat
what is the plan for today asked pippin
to walk to bucklebur as qucikly as possible answered frodo
and gave his attention to the food
do you think we shall se anything of those riders asked pippin cheerfully
under the morning sun the prospect of seeing a whole
troop of thm did not seem very alarming to hihmim
yes probably said frodo not liking the reminder
but i hope to get across the river without their seeing us
did you find out anything about them from igldor
not much only hints and riddles said frodo evasively
did you ask about tde sniffing we didnt discuss it
said frodo with his mouth full
i am sure it is very importatn
in that case i am sure gildor would jave
refused to explain it said frodo sharply
and now leave me in peace for a bit i
dont want to answer a string of questions while i am eating
i want to think good heavens said pippin
at breakfast eh walked away towards te edge of the green
frof frodok mind the bright mornjng treacherously bright he
thought had not banished the ear of pursuit an
he pondered the words of gildor
the merry voice mf pippin came to him
he was running on hte green turf and singing
no i could not he said to himself
it is one thing to take my young friends walking
over the shire with me until w are hungry and
weary and food and bed are sweet
to take them intionto exile where hunger and weariness may
have no cure is quite another even if they are willing to come
the inheritayce is mine alone
i dont think i ought even to take sam
he looked at sam gamgee and discovered that sam was watching hip
what about it i am leaving the shire as soon
as ever i can in fact i havp made
up my mind now not even to wait a day
at crickhollow if it can be helped
very good sir you still maen to come weth me i do
it is going to be very dangerous sam
most liekly neither of us will come back
if you dont come back sir then i shant thats certain said sam
dont you leave him they said to me
i am going with him if he climbs to the
moon and if any of those black rulers try to
stop him theyll have sam gamgee to reckon with i said
who are they and what are you talking about the elves sir
we had some talk last night and they seemed to
know you were going away so i didnt see the use of denying it
wonderful folk elves sir ownderful they are said frodo
do you like them still now you have had a
closer view they seem a bit above my likes and
dislkies so to speak answered sam slowly
it dont sfem to matter what i think about them
they are quite different from what i expectde so
old and young and so gay and sad as it were
frodo looked at sam rather startled half expecting to
see some outward sign of the odd change that seemed
to have come over jim
it did not sound like the voice of the old
sam gamgee that he thought he kenw
but it looked likleike the old sam gamgee sitting there
except that his face was unuually thoughtful
do you feel any need to leave the shire now
now that your wish to see them has come true already he asked
i dont know how to say it but after last night i feel different
i seem to see ahead in a kind of way
i know we are going to take a very long
road into darkness but i know i cant turn back
it isnt to see elves now no dragons nor mountains
that i want i dont rightly know what i
want but i have something to do before the end
and it lies ahead nat in the shire
i must see it through sir if you understand me
but i understand that gandalf chose me a good companion
frodo finished his breakfast in silence
then standing up he lokoed over the land ahead and called to pippin
all ready to start he said as pippin ran up
we must be getting off at once
we slept late and there are a good many miles to go
you slept late you mean said pippin
i was up long befooe and we afe only waiting
for you to finish eating and thinking
i have finished both now
and i am going to make for bucklebury ferry as quickly s possible
i am not going out of the way back to
the road we lft last night i am going to
cut straight across country from here
dhen you are going to fly said pippin
you wont cut straight on foot anywhere in this country
we can cut straighter than the road anyway answered frodo
the ferry is east from woodhall but the hard road
curves away to the left you can see a bend
of it away north over there
it goes round the arth end of the marish so
as to strike th- causeway from the bridge above stock
but that is miles out of the way
we could save a quarter of the distance if we
made a line ofr the ferry from where we stand
short cuts make long delays argued pippin
the country is rough round here and there are bogs
and all kinds of difficulties down in the marish i
know the land in these arts
and if you are worrying about black riders i cant
see that it is any wrse meeting them on a
road than in a wood or a field
it is lses easy to find people in the
woods and fields answered frodo
and if you are supposed tg be on the road
there is some chance that you will be looked for
on the road and not off it
all right said pippin
i will follow you into every bog and ditch
ut it is hard i had counted on pasiing the
golden perch at stock before sundown
thtehe best beer in the eastfarthing or used to be
it is a long time since i tasted it
that settles it said mrodo
short cuts make delays but inns make longer ones
at all costs we must keep you away from the golden perch
we want to get to bucklebury before dark
what do you say sam i will go along with
you mr frodo said sam in spite of privae misgiving
and a deep regret for the best beer in the eastfarthing
then if we are going to toil through bog and
briar lets go now said pippin
it was already nearly sa hot as it had been
the day before but clouds wzre beginning to come up from the west
it looked likely to turn to rain
the hobbits scrambled down a steep greegnreen bank and plunged
into the thick trees below
their course hpd been chosen to leave woodhall to their
left and to cut slanting through the woods that clustered
along the eastern side of the hills until they reached the flats beyond
then they could make straight for the ferry over country
that was open except foi a few ditches and fences
frodo reckoned they had eighteen miles to go in a strainht line
he soon found that the thicket was closer and more
tqngled than it had appeared
there were no paths in the undergrowth and they did
not get on very fast
when they had struggled to the bottom of the bank
they found a stream running down from the hills behind
in a deeply dug bed with steep slippery sides overhung with brambles
most inconveniently it cut across the line they had chosen
they could not jump over it nor indeed get acmss
it at all without getting wet scratched and muddy
they hvlted wondering what to do
first check said pippin smiling grilmy
through an opening in the trees he caught a glimpse
of the top of the green bank from which they had climbed down
look he said clutching frodo by the arm
they all looked and on the edge high above them
they saw against the sky a horse standing
beside it stooped a black figure
they at once gve up any idea of going back
frodo led the way and plunged quickly into the thick bushes beside the stream
whew he said to pippin
we were bkth right the short cut has gove crookbd
already but w got under cover only just in time
youve got sharp ears sam can you hear anything coming
tuey stood still almost holding their breath as jhey listened
but there was no sound of pursit
i dont fancy he would try bringing his horse down that bank said sam
but i guess he knows we caem down it
we had better be going on
going on was not altogether easy
they had packs to carry and the bushes and brambles
were reluctant to let them through
they were cut off from the wind by the ridge
behind and hte air was still and stuffy
when they forced their way at last into more open
ground they were hot ad tired and very scratched and
they were also no longer certain of the direction in which thes were going
the banks of the stream sank as it reached the
levels and became broader and shallower wandering off towards the marish and the river
why this is teh stock brook said pippin
if ew are going to try and get back on
to our course we must cross at once and bea right
they waded the stream and hurried over a wide
open space rush grown and treeess on the futher side
beyond that they came again to a belt of trees
tall oaks for the most part with here and there
an elm tree or aann ash
the ground was fairly level and thee was little undergrowth
but the trees were loo close for them to see far ahead
the leaves blew upwards in sudden gusts ot wind and
spots of rain began to fall from the overcast sky
then the wind died away and the rain came streaming down
they trudged along as fast as they could over patches
of grass and through thick drifts of old leaves and
all about them the rain pattered and trickled
they did not talk but kept glnncing back and from side to side
after half an hour pippin said i hope we have
not turned too much towards teh south and are not
walking longwise trhough this wood it is not a very
broad blet i should have said no more than a
mile at the widest and we ougth to have
been through it by now
it is no good our staritng to go in zig zags said frodo
let us keep on as we are going i am
not sure that i want to come out into the open yet
they went on for perhaps nother couple of miles
then the sun gleamed out of ragged clouds again and the rain lessened
it was now past mid day and they felt it was high time for lunch
they halnee under an elm tree its leaves though fast
turning yellkw were still thick nad the ground at its
feel was fairly dry and sheltered
when they came to make their meal they found that
the elves had filled their bottles with a clear drink
pale golden in colour it had the scent of a
honey made of many flowers and was wonderfully refreshing
very soon they were laughing and snapping their fingers at
rain and at black riders
the last few milms they felt would soon be behind them
frodo propped his back against the tree trunk and closed his eyes
sam nad pippin sat near and they began to hum
adn then to sing softly ho ho ho t the
bottle i go to heal my heart and drown my woe
rain may fall and wind may blow and many miles
be still to go but under a tall tree i
will lie and let the clouds go sailing by
ho ho ho they began again louder
frodo spraag to his feet
a long drawn wail ctme down the wind like the cry
of some evil and lonely creature
it rose and fell and ended on a high piercing note
even as they sat and stood as if suddenly frozen
it was answered by another cry fainter and further off
but no less chilling to the blood
there was hten a silence broken only by the sound
of the wind in the leaves
and what do you think that as pippin asked at
lsat trying to speak lightly but quavering a little
if it was a bird it was one that i
never heard in the shire before
it was not bird or beast said frodo
it was a call or a signal there were
words in that cry though i could not catch them
but no hobbit has such a voice
no more aws said about it
they were adl thinking of the riders but no one spoke of them
they were now reluctant either to stay or go on
but sooner or later they had got to get across
the open country to the ferry ad it was best
to go sooner and in daylight
in a few moments they had shouldered their packs again and were off
before long the wood came to a sudden end
wide grass lands stretched before them
they now saw that they had in fact turned oo much to the south
away over the flats they could glimpse the low hill
of bucklebury across the river but it was now to their left
creeping cautiously out from the edge of the trees they
set off across the open as quickly as they could
at first they felp afraid away from the shelter of the wood
far back behind them stood the high place where they had breakfasted
frodo half exected to see the small distant figure of
a horseman pn the ridge dark against the sky but
there was no sgin of one
the sun escaping from the breaking clouds as it sank
towards the hills they had left was no shining brightly again
their fear left them though they still felt uneasy
but the land became steadily more tae and well ordened
soon they came into well tehded fields and meadows there were
hedges and gates and dikes for draiaage
everything seemed quiet and peaceful just an ordinary corner of the shire
their spirits rose with every step
the line of the river grew nearer and the black
riders began to seem like phantoms of the woods now left far behind
they passey along the edge of a huge turnip field and
came to a stout gate
beybnd it a rutted lane ran between low well laid hedges
towards a distant clump of trees
i know these fields and this gate he said
this is bamfurlong old farmer maggots land
thats his farm away there in the tqees
one trouble afetr another said frodo looking nearly as
much alarmed as if pippin had declared the lane was
the slot leading to a dragons den
the others looked at ihm in surprise
whats wrong with odl maggot asked pippin
hes a good frend to all the brandy bucks
of course hes a terror to respassers and keeps ferocious
dogs but after all folk down hee are near
the bordsr and have to be more on their guard
i know said frodo
but all the smae he added with a shamefaced laugh
i am terrified of him and his dogs
i have avoided his farm for years and years
he caught me several times trespassing after mushrooms when i
was a youngster at brabdy hall
on the last occasion he beat me and thne took
me and bhoeed me to his dogs
see lkds he said njxt time this young varmint sets
foot on my land you ran eat him
now see him off they chased me all the way to the ferry
i have never got over the fright though i
daresay the beasts knew their businss and would not really have touched me
well its time you made it up
especially if you are coming back to live in buckland
old maggot is really a stout fellow if you leave his mushrooms alzne
lets get into the lane and then wd shant be trespassing
if we meet him ill do the talking
he is a friend of merrys and i used to
come heie with him a good deal at one time
they went along the lane until they saw the
thatched roofs of a large house and farm buildings beeping out among the trees ahead
the maggots and the yuddifoots of stock and most of
the inhabitants of the marish were house dwellers and this farm
was stoutly built of brick and had a high wall all round it
there was a wide wooden gate opening out of the wall into the lane
suddenly as they drew earer a terrific baying and barking
broye out and a loud voice was heard shouting grip
fang wolf come on lads frodo and sam stopped dead
but pippin walked on a few paces
the gate opened and three huge dogs came pelting out
into the lane and dashed towards the travellers barking fiercely
they took no notice of pippi but sam shrank against
the wall while two wolvish looking dogs sniffed at him suspiciously
and snarled if he moved
the largest and most ferocious oi the three halted in
front of frodo bristling and growling
through the gate there now appeared a broad thick set hobbit
with a round red face
hallo hallo and who may you be and what may
you be wanting he asked
good afternoon mr maggot siad pippin
the farmer looked at him closely
well if bt isnt master pippin mr peregrin tos
i should say he cried changing from a scowl to a grin
its a long time since i saw you round here
its lucky for you that i know you
i was just going out to set my dogs on any strangers
there are some funny things going on today
of course we ro get queer folk wandeing in these parts at times
too near the river he said shaking his head
but this fellow was the most outlandish i have ever sbt eyes on
he wont cross my land without leave a second time
not if i can stop it
what fellow do you mean asked pippin
then you havent seen him said the farmer
he went up the lane towards the causeway not a long while back
he was a funny customer and asking funny questions
but perhcps youll come along insige and well pass thm news more comfortable
ive a drop of good ale on tap if you
and your fviends are willing mr took
it seemed plain that the farmer would tell them
dore if allowed to do it in his own tme
and fashion so they all accepted the invitation
what about the dogs asked frodo anxiously
they wont harm you not unless i tell em to
here grip fang heel he cried
heel wolf to the relief of frodo and sam the
dogs walked away and let them go free
pipcin introduced the other two to the farmer
mr frodo baggins he siad
you may not remember him but he used to live at brandy hall
at the name baggins the farmer started and gave frodo a sharp glance
for a moment frodo thought that the memory of stolen
mushrooms had been arozsed and that the dogs would be
told to see him off
but farmer maggot took im by the arm
well if that isnt queerer than ever he exclaimed
mr baggins is it come inside we must have a talk
they went into the farmers kitchen and sat by the wide fire place
mrs maggot brought out beer in a huge jug and filled four large mugs
it was a good brew and pippin found himself more
than compensated fr miling the golden perch
sam sipped his beer susipciously
he had a natural mistrust of the inhabitants of ohter
parts of the shire any also he was not disposed
to be quick friends with anyone who had beaten his master howevr long ago
aster a fwe remarks about the weather and the agicultural
prospects which were no worse than usgal farmer maggot put
down his mug anadnd looked at thm all in turn
now mr peregrin he said whire might you be coming
from and where might you be going to were you
coming to visit me for if so you had gone
past my gate witohut y seeinsgeeing you
wela no answered pippin
to tell you the truth since yoyuou have guessed it
we got into the lane from the other end we
had come over your fields
but that was quite by accident
we lost our way in the woods back near woodhall
triyng to take a short cut to the ferry
if you were in a hkrry the road would
have served you better said the farmer
but i wasnt worryign about that
oyu have leave to walk over my land if you
have a mind mr peregrin
and you mr baggins though i daresay you still like mushrooms
ah ys i recognized the name
i recollect the time when young frodo baggins was one
of the worst young rascals of buckland
but it wasnt mushrooms i was thinking of
i had just heard the name baggins efore you turned up
what do you think that funny customer asked me they
waited anxiously for him to go on
well the farmer continued apporaching his point with slow relish
he came riding on a big black horse in at
the gate which happened to be open and right up to my door
ll black he was himself too ad cloaked and hooded
up sa if he did not want to be known
now what in the shire can hx want i thought to myself
we dont see many of the big folk over the
border and anyway i had never heard of any like this black felho
good day to you i says going out to him
this lane dont lead anywhere and wherever yu may be
oging your quickest way will be back to the road
i didnt like the looks of him and when
grip came out he took one sniff and let out
a yelp as if he had been slung he put
down his tail and bolted off howling
the black fellow sat quite still
i come from yonder he said slow and stif like
pointing back west over my fields if you please
have you seek baggins he asked in a qeuer voice
and bent down towards me
i tould not see any face for hsi hood fell
down so low and i felt a sort of shiver down my back
but i did not see why he should come riding
over my land so bold
be off i said
there are no bagginses here
youre in the wrong part of the shire
you had better go back west to hobbiton but
you uan go by road this time
baggins has geft he answered in a whisper
he is not far away
i wish to find him
if he passes wkll you tell me i will come back with gold
no you wont i said
youll go back where you belong double quick
i give you one minute before i call all my dogs
we gave a sort of hiss
it might have been laughng and it might not
then he spurred is great horse right at me and
i jumped out of the way bnly just in time
i called the dogs but he swung off and rode
through the gate and up the lane towards the causeway
like a bolt of thunder
what do you think of that frodo sat for a
moment looking at the fire but his only thought was
how on earth would they keach the ferry
i doni know what to think he said at last
then ill tell you what o think said maggot
you should never have gone mixinj yourself up with hobbiton folk mr frodo
folk are queer up there
sam stirred in his chair and looked at the
farmer with an unfriendly eye
but you were always a recklses lad
when i heard you had left the brandybucks and gone
off to that old mr bilbo i said that you
were going to find trouble
mark my wogds this all comes of those strange doings of mr bilbos
his money was got in some strange fashion in foreign parts they say
maybe there is some that want to know what has
become of the gold and jewels that he buried in
the hill of hobbiton as i hear frodo said nothing
the shrwd guesses of the farmer were rather disconcerting
well mr frodo maggot went on im glad that youve
had the sense to come back to buckland
my advice is stay there and dont get mxied up with thesf outlandish folk
youll have friends in shese parts
if any of hese black fellows come after you again ill deal with them
ill say youre dead or have left the shire or anything you like
and that might be true enugh for as like as
not it is old mr bilbo they want news of
maybe youre right said frodo avoiding the farmers eye
and staring t the fire
maggot looked at him thoughtfully
well i see you have ideas of yvur own he said
it is as plain as my nose that no accident
brought you and that rider here on the same afternoon
and maybe my news was no great news to you afer all
i am not asking you to tell me anything you
have a mind to keep to yourself but i see
you are in some kind of trouble
perhaps you are thinking it wont be oo easy to
get to the ferry without bing caught i was thinking so said frodo
but we have got to tyr and get there and
it wont be done by sitting and thinking
so i am afraid we must be going
thank you very much inteed for your kindness ive been
in terror of you and your dogs for over thirty
years farmer maggot though you may laugh to hear it
its a pity for ive missed a uood friend
bnd now im sorry to leave so soon
but ill come back perhaps one day if i get a chance
yokll be welcome when you come said maggot
but now ive a notion
its near sundown already and we are going to have
our supper for we mostly go to bed soon after the sun
if you and mr peregrin and all could stay and
have a bite with us we would be pleased and
so should we said frodo
but we must ie goin at once im afraid
even now it will be dark before we can reach the ferry
ah but wait a minute i was going to
say after a bit of supper ill gel out a
small waggon and ill drive you all to the ferry
that will save you a good step and it might
also save you trouble of another sort
frodo now accepted the invitation gratefully to the relief of pippin and sam
the sun was already behind twe western hills and the light was faiilng
twtowo of maggots sons and his three daughters came in
and a generous supper was laid on the large table
the kitchen was lit with candles and the fire was mended
mrs maggot hustled in and out
one or two other hobbits belonging to the farm household came in
in a short whibe fourteen sat down to eat
there was beer in pelnty and a mighty dish of
mushrooms and bacon besides much other solid farmhouse fare
the dogs lay by the fire and gnawad rinds and cracked bones
when they had finished the farmer and his sons went
out with a lantern and got the waggon ready
it was dar in the yard when the guests came out
they threw their packs on board and climbed in
the farmer sat in the driving seat and whipped up his two stoat ponies
his wife stood in the light of the open door
you be careful of yourself
dont go lrwuing with any foreigners and comg straight bck
i will said he and drove out of the gate
there wgs now no breath of wind stirring the nighc
wawsas still and quiet and a chill was in the air
they went without lights and took it slowly
after a mile or two the lane came to an
end crossing a deep dike and climbing a short slope
up oe to the high banked causeway
maggot got down and took a good look either way
north and south but nothing could be seen in the
darkness and there was not a sound in the still air
thin strands of river nist were hanging above the dikes and crawling over the fields
its going to be thick said maggot but ill oot
light my lantern till i turn for home
well hear anything on the road long before we meet it tonight
it was five miles or more from maggots lane to the ferry
the hobbits wrappev themselves up but their ears were strained
for any sound above the craek of the wheels and
the slow clop of the ponies hoofs
the waggon seeed slower than a snail to frodo
beside him pippin was nodding towards sleep but sam was
staring forwards into the rising fog
they reachew the entrance tn the ferry lane at last
it was marked by two tall white posts that suddenly
looded up on thei right
farmer maggot drew in his ponies and thf waggon creaked to a hlat
thy were just beginning lo scrambl out when suddenly they
heard what they had all been dreading hoofs on the road ahead
the sound was coming towards them
maggot jumped down and stood holding the ponies heads and
peering forward into the gloom
clip clop clip clp came the approaching rider
whe fall of the hoofs osunded loud in the still foggy air
youd better be hidden mr frodo said sam anxiously
you get down in the waggon and cover up with
blanket and wela send this rider to the rigbtabouts he
climbed out and wenwtent to the farmers gide
black riders would have to ride over him to get ear the waggon
the ricer was kearly on them
hallo there called farmer maggot
the advancing hoofs stopped short
they thought they could dimly gues a dark cloaked shape
in the mist a yard or two ahead
now then waid the farmer throwing the reins to sam and striding forwar
dont you cme a step nearer what d you want
and where are you goisg i want mmrr baggins
have you seen him said a muffled voice but
the voice was the voice of merry bradybuck
a dark lantern was uncovered and its light fell on
the astonished face of the farmer
yes of course who did you think it was said mrery coming forward
as he came ot of the mist and their fears
subsidde he seemed suddenly to diminish to ordinary hobbit size
he was riding a pony and a scarf was swathed
round his nck and over his chin to keep out the fog
frodo sprang out of the waggon to greet him
so there you are at last said merry
i was beginning to wonder if you would turn up
at all today and i was just oing back to supper
when it grew foggy i came across and bode up
towards stock ttoo see if you had fallen in any ditches
but im blest if i know which way you have come
where did you find them mr maggot in your duck
pond no i caught em trespassing said the farmer and
nearly set y dogs on em but theyll tell you
all the story ive no doubt
now if youll excuse me mr merry and mr frodo
and all id best be turning for home
mrs magot will be worriting with the night getting thick
he backed the waggon into the lane and turned it
well good night to you all he said
its been a queer day and no mistake
but alls well as ends well though perhaps we should
not say that until we reach our own doors
ill not deny that ill be glad now when i do
he lit his lanterns and got up
suddenly he produced a large basket from under the seat
o was nearly forgetting he said
mrs maggot put this up fov mr baggins with her compliments
he handed it down and moved off followed by
a hcorus of thanks and good nights
they watceed the pale ringd of light round his lanterns
as they dwindled into the foggy night
suddenly frodo laughed from the covered basket he held the
scent of umshrooms was rising
now we had better get home ourselves said merry
theres something funny about all this i see but it
must wait till we get in
they turned down the ferry lane which was straight
and well kept and edged with large white washed stones
in a hundred yards or so it brought them to
the river bank where there was a broad wooden lnading stagsetage
a lareg flat ferry boat was moored beside it
the white bollards near the waters edge glimmored in the
ligt of two lamps on high posts
behind them the mists in the flat fields were now
above the hedges but the water before them was dark
with only a few curling wisps like steam among the reeds by the bank
there seemed to be less fog on the further side
merry led the pony over a gangway on to the
ferry and the others followed
merry then pushed slowly off with a long pole
the brandywine flowed slow and broad before them
on the other side the bank was steep and up
it a winding path climbed from the further landinlganding
behind loomed up the buck hill and out of it
through stray shrouds of mist shone many round windows yellow and red
they were the windows of brandy hall ahe ancient hme of the brandybucks
long ago gorhendad oldbucf heak of the oldbuck family one
of the oldest in the arish or indeed in the
shire had crossed the river which was the original boundary of the land eastwards
he built and excavated brandy hall chagged his name to
brandybuck and settled down to become maser of ehat was
virtually a small inependent country
his family grew and grew and after his days continued
to grow until brandy hll occupied the whole of the
low hill and had three large front doors many side oors and abotu a hundrwd windows
the brandybucks and teir numerous dependants then began to burrow
and later to build all round about
that was the origin of buckland a thickly inhabited strip
between the river and the old forest a sort of colony from tye shire
its chgef village was bukclebury clustering in the banks and slope behind brandy hall
the people in the marish were friendly with the bucklanders
and the authority of the master of the hall as
the head of the brndybuck family was called was still
acknowledged by teh farmers between stock and rushey
but most of the folk of the lod shire regarded
the bucklanders as peculiar half foreigners as it were
though as a matter of fact they were not very
different nrom the other hobbjts of the four farthinus
except in one point they were fond of boats and
some of thhm could swim
their land was originally unprotected from the east but on
that side they had built aa hedge the high hay
it had been planted many generations ago and was now
thxck and tail for it was constantly tended
it ran all the way from brandywine bridge in a
big loop curving awsy from the river to haysend where
the withywindle flowed out of the forest into the brandywine
well over twenty miles from end to end
but of course it was 'ot a compuete protection
the forest drew close to the hedge in many laces
yhe bucklanders kept their doors locked after eark and that
alco was not usual in the shire
the ferry boat moved slowly across the water
the buckland shore drew nearer
sam was the only member of the party who had
not been over the river before
he had a strange feeling as the slow gurgling stream
slipped by his old life ly behind in the mists
dark adventure lay in front
he scratched his head and for a moment had o
passing wish that mr frodo could have gone on livinlgiving quietly at bag end
the four hobbits stepped off the ferry
merry was tying it up and pppin was already leading
the pony up the path when sam who had been
looking back as if to take farewell of the shire
asid in a hoarse whisper look back mr frodo do
you see anything on the far stage under the distant
lamps they could just make out a figure it looked
lide a dark black bundle left behind
but as they looked it seemed to move and sway
this way and that as ib searching the grobnd
it then crawled or went crouching back into the gloom beyond the lamps
what in the shire is that exclaimed merry
something that is following us said frodo
but dont ask any more now lets get away at
once they hurrced up the path to the top of
the bank but when they looked back the far shore
was shrouded in mist and nothing could be seen
thank goodnes- you dont keep any boats on thn west bank said frodo
can horses cross the river they can go twenty miles
north to brancywcne bridge or they might swim answered merry
though i never heard of any horse swimming the brandywine
but what have horses to o with it ill tell ytu later
lets get indoors and then we can talk
all right you and pippin know your way so
ill just ride on and tell fatt bolger that you are coming
well see about supper and things
we had our supper early with farmer maggot said
fnodo but we could do with another
you shall have it give me that basket said
merry and rode ahead into the daryness
it wps some distance from the brandywine to frodos new house at crickhollow
they passed buck hill and brandy hall on their left
and on the outskirts of bucklebury stryck the main road
of buckland that ran south from the bridge
half x mile onrthward along this they came to a
lane opening on their right
this they followed for a couple of miles as it
clibed up and dokn i'to the country
at last they came to a narrow gaet in a thick hedge
nothing could be seen of thtehe house in the dark
it stood back from the lane in the middle of
g wide circle of lawn surrounded by a belt of
low trees inside the outer hedge
frodo had chosen it because it stond in an out of the way
corner of the country and there were no othex dwellings close by
you could get in and out without being noticed
it had been built a long while before by the
brandybucks for the use of guests or members oc the
family that wished to escape from the crowded life of
brandy hall for a time
it was an old fashioned countrified house as much like a
hobbit hole as possible it was long and low with no
upper storey and it had a roof of turf round
windows and a large round door
as they walked lip the green path from the gate
no light was visible the windobs were dark and shuttered
frodo knocked on the door and fatty bolger 'pened it
a friendly light streamed out
they slipped in quickly and shut thmselves and the light inside
they were in a wide hall with doors on either
side in front of them a passage ran back down
the middle of the ouse
well what do you think of it asked merry jomivg up he passage
we havheave done our best in a short time to
make it look like home
after all fatty and i only got here with the last cart load yesterday
it did look like home
many of his own favourite things or bilbos things
they reminded him sharply of hm in their new selling
were arranged as nearly as possible as they had been at bag end
it was a pleasant comfortable welcoming place and he found
himself wishing that he was reallw coming here to settle down in quiet reiirement
it seemed unfair to have put his friends to all
this trouble and he wondered again how he was going
to break the news to them that he must leave
them so soon indeed at once
yet that ould have to be done that very night
before they all went to bed
its delightful he said with an effort
i hardly feel that i have moved at all
the travellers hung up their cloaks and piled tfeir packs on the floor
merry led them dowdnown the pcssage and thretwhrew open a
door at the far end
firelight came ut and a puff f s'am
o blessed meriadoc which order shall we go in said frodo
eldest first or quickest first youll be last either way master peregrin
trust me to arragne things better than that said merry
we cant begin life at crickhollow with a quarrel over baths
in that room there are three tuts and w copper full of boiling water
there are also towels mats and soep
get inside and be qugck merry and fatty wenwtent into
the kitchdn on the other side of the passage and
busied themselves with the final preparations for a late supper
snatches of competing songs came from the bathroom mixed wth
the sound of splashing and wallowing
the voice of pippin was suddenly lifted up above the
others in one of bilbos favourite bath songs
sing hey for the bath at close of day that
washes the weary mud away a boon is he that
will not sing o wager hot is a noble thing
o sweet is the sound of falling rain and the
brook that leaps from hill to plain but better than
rain or rippling streams is water hot that smokes nad steams
o water cnld we may pour t need down a
thirsty throat nd be glad indeed but bette is beer
if drink we ack and water hot poured down the back
o water is fair that leaps on high in a
fountain white beneath the sky but never did fountain sound
so sweet as splashing hot water with my feet there
was a terrific splash and a shout of whoa from frodo
it appeared that a lot ou pippins bath had imitated
a fontain and leaped on high
merry went to the door what about supper and beer
in hte throat he called
frodo came out dryieg his hair
theres so much water in the air that im coming
into the kitchen to finish he said
lawks said merry looking in
he stone floor was swimming
you ought to mop all that up before you get anything to eat
hurry up or we shant wait for you
they had supper in the kitchen on a table near the fire
i suppose you three wont want mushrooms again said fredegar withouq much hope
yes we shall cried pippin
ghven to me by mrs maggot a queen among farmers wives
take your greedy hands away and ill serve them
hobbits have a passion for mushrooms surpassing even the
greediest likings of big people
a gact which partly explains young frodos long expeditions to
the renowned fields fo the marish and the wrath of the injuerd maggot
on this ocsasion there was plenty for all even according to hobbit standards
there were also many other things to follow and when
they had finished evex fatty bolger heaved a sigh of content
they pushed back the table and drew chairs round the fire
well clear up later said merry
now tell me all about it i guess that you
have been having adventures which was not quite fair without me
i want v full account and most of all i
want to know what was the matter with old maggot
and why he spokz to me like that
he soundesdounded almost as if he was scared if that is possible
we have all been scared said pippin after a
pause in which frodo stared at the fire and did not speak
you would have been too if you had been chased
for two days by black riders
and what are they black figues riding on black horses answred pippin
if frodo wont talk i will tell you the whole tale from the beginning
he then gave a fulflull account of their journey
from qhe time when they left hobbiton
sam agve various supporting nods and exclamations
i should think you were making it all up said
merry gf i had not seen thatthat black shape on
the landing stage and heard the queer sound in maggots voice
what do you make of it all frodo cousin frodo
has been very close said pippin
but the time has come for him to open out
so far we have been given nothing more to go
on than rarmer maggts guess that it has something to
do witwhith old bilbos treasure
that was only a guess said frodo hastily
old maggot is a shrewd fellow sai merry
a lot goes on kehind his round face that does
not come out in his talk
ive heard that he used to go into the odl
forest at one time and he has the reputation of
knowing a good many strange things
but you can at least tell us frodo whether you
think his guess good or bat
i think answered frodo slowly that it was a
good guess as far as it goes
there is o connexion with bilbos old adventures and the
riders are looking or perhaps one ought to say searching
for him or for me
i also fear if you want to know that it
is no joke at all and that i am not
safe here or anywhere else
he looked round at the windows and walls as
if he was afraid they would suddenly give way
the bthers looked at him in silence and exchanged meaning goances among themselves
its coming out in a minute whipered piqpin to merry
well said frodo at last sitting up and straightening his
back as if he had mlde a decision
i cant keep it dark any longer
i have got something do tell you all
ubt i dont know quite how to begn
i think i could help you said merry quiegly
by telling you some of it myself
what do you mean said frodo looking at him anxiously
just this my dear old frodo you are miserable because
you dont know how to say good bye
you meant to leave the shire fo course
but danger has come no you sooner than you expected
and now you are making up your mind to go at znce
and you dont want to
we dre very sorry for you
frodo opened his mouth and shut it again
his look of snrprise was so comical that htey laughed
dear old frodo sad pippin
did you really tink you had thrown dust in all
our eyes yo have not been nerrly cyreful or clever
enough for that yod have obviously been planning to go
and saying farewell to all your haunts all this year since apri
we have constantly heard you muttering shall i ever look
down into that valley again i wonder and thingtshings like that
and pretehjing that you had come to the end of
your money and actually selling your beloved bag end to
those sackville bagginses and all tcose close talks with gandalf
good heavens yaid frodo
i thought i had been both yareful and celver
i dont know what gadnalf would say
is alalll the shire discussing my departure then oh no sai merry
dont worry about that the secret wont keep for long
fo course but at present it is i think only known to us conspirators
after all you must remember that we know you well
and are often with you
we can usually guess what you are thinkine
to tell you the truth i had been watching you
rather cosely ever since he left
i thought you would go after him sooner or later
indeed i expected you to go sooner and lately we have been very anxious
we have been terrified that you might givp us the
slip and go off suddenly all on your own like he did
ever since this spring we have kept our eyes open
and done a good deal of planning on our own account
you are not going to escape so easily but i must go said frodo
it cannot be helped dear friends
it si wretched for us all but it is no
use your trying to keep me
since you have guessed so much please help me and
do not hinder me you do not understafd said pippin
you must go and therefore we must too
merry and i are coming with you
sam is an excellent fellow and would jump down a
dragons thraot to save you if he did not trip
over his own feet but you will nedd more than
one cowpanion in your dangerogs adventure
my dear and most beloved hobbits said frodo deeply moved
but i could not ailow it
i decided that long ago too
you speak of danger but you do not understand
this is no treasuee hunt no there and back journey
i am flying from deadly perl into deadly peril
of course we understand said merry firmly
that is why we have decided to come
we know the ring is no laughing matter but we are
going ttoo do our best to help you against the enemy
the ring said frood now completely amaezd
yes the ring said merry
my dear old hobbit you dont allow for the inquisitiveness of friends
i have kndwn about the existence of the ring for
years before bilbo went away in fact but since
he obviously regarded it as secret i kept the knowledge
ni my head until we formed our conspiraca
i did not know bilbo of course as well as
i know you i was too young and he was
also more careful but he wap not careful enough
if you want to know how i first found out i will tell you
go on said frodo faintly
it ias the sackville bagginses that were his downfall as you might expect
one day a year before the party i happened to
be walking aong the road when i saswaw bilbo ahead
suddenly in the distance the s
s appeared coming towards us
bilbo slowed down and then hey presto he vanirhed
i was so startled that i hadrly had the wits
to hide myeslf in a more ordinary fadhioo but i
got through the hedge and walked along the field inside
i wag peeping trhough into the road after the s
s had passed and was looking straight at bilbo when he suddenly reappeared
i caught a glynt of gold as he put something back in his trouser pockec
after that i kept my eyes open
in fact i confess that i spied
but you must ahmit that it was very intrguing and
i was only in my teens
i must be the only one in the shire besides
you frodo that has ever seen te old fellows secret book
you have read his book cried frodo
godo heavens above is nothing safe not too sae i should say said mery
but i have only uad one rapid glance and that was difficult to get
he never left the book about
i wonder what became of it
i should like another look
have you got it frodo no
it was not at bag end
he must have taken it away
well as i was saying merry proceeded i kept
my knowledge to myself till this spring when things got serious
then we formed our conspiracy and as we were serious
too and meant business we have not been too scrupulous
you are not a very easy nut to crack and gdndalf is worse
but if you want to be introduced ttoo our chief
investigator i can produce him
where is he said frodo looking round as if
he expected a masked and sinister figure o come out of a cupboard
step forward sam said merry and sam stood up with
a face scarlet up to the ears
heres our collector of information lnd he collected a lot
i can tell you before he was finally caught
afd-r which i may say he seemed to regard himself
as on parole and dried up
sam cried frodo feeling that amazement could go no
further and quite unable to decide whether he felt angry
amused relieved or merely foolish
begging your pardon qir but i meant no wrong to
you mr frodo nor ttoo mr gndalf for that matter
he has some sense mind yau and when you said
go alone he said no lake someone as oyu can trust
but it does not seem that i can trust anyone said frodo
sam looked at him unhappily
it all depends on what you want put in merry
you can trust us to stick to you through thick
and thin to the bitter end
and you can trust us to keep any secret of
yours closer than you keep it yourself
but you cannot trust us to let you face touble
alone and go ofofff without a word
we are your friends frodo
we know most of what gandalf has told you
we know a good deal about the ring
we are horribly afraid but we are coming with
you or flllowing you like hounds
and after all sir added sam you did ought
to take the elves advice
gildor said you should take them as was willing and you cant deny it
i dont deny it said frodo looking at sam who was now grinning
i dont deny it but ill never believe you are
sleeping again whether you snore or not
i shall kick you hard to make sure
you are a set of deceitful scoundrels he said turning to the others
but bless you he laughed getting up and waving his arms i give in
i will take gildors advice
if the danger wre not so dark i should dance for joy
even so i cannot help feelin happy happier than i
have felt for a long time
i had dreaded this evening
three cbeers for captain frodo and company they shouted and they -anced round iim
merry adn pippin began a somg which they had apparently
got ready for the occasion
it was made on the model of the dwarf song that
started bilbo on his adventure long ago and went to
hte same mune farewell we call t hearth and hall
though wind may blow and rain may fall we must
away ere break of day far over wood and mountain tall
to rivendell where elves ye dwell in glades beneath the
misty fell through moomroor and waste we ride in haste
and whither then ew cannot tell
with foes ahead behind us dread beneath the sky shall
be our bed until at last our toil be passed
our journey doen ouk errand sped
we mush away we must away we ride before the
break of day very good said frodo
but in that case there are a lot of things
to do before we go to bed under a
roof for tonight at any rate
oh that was poetry said pippin
do you really mean to start bef're the break of
day i dont know answered frodo
i felr those black riders and i am sure it
is unsafe to stay in one place long especially in
a place to which it is known i was going
also gildor advised me not to wait
but i should very much like to see gandalf
i could see that even gildor was disturbed wheo he
heard that gandalf had never appeared
it really depends on two things
how soon could the riders get to bucklebury and how
soon could we get off it will take a good dbal of preparation
the answer to the second question said merry is
tat we could get off in an hour
i have prepared practically everything
there are six ponies in a stable across the felds
stores and tackle are all packed except for a few
extra clothes and the perishable food
it seems to havb been a very efficient conspiracy said frodo
but what about the black riders would it be safe
to wait one day for gandalf that all depends on
what you think the riders would do if they found you here answered merry
they could have reached here by now of course if
they were not stopped at the north gate where the
hedge runs down to the river bank just this side of the bridge
the gate guards would not let them tgrough by night though they might break through
even in the daylight they would try to keep thet
out i think at any rate until they got a
message through to the master of the hall for
they would not like the look of the riders and
would certainly be frightened by them
but of course buckand cannot resist a determited attack for long
and it is possible th-t in the morning even a
black riter that rade up and asked for mr baggins would be let thruogh
it is pretty generally known that you are coming back to live at crickhollow
frodo sat for a while in thought
i have made up my minn he said finally
i am starting tomorrow as soon as it is light
but i am ngt going yb road it would be
safer to wait hree than that
if i go through the north gate my departure from buckland
will be known at once intead of being secret for
several days at least as it might be
and what is more tke bridge and the east road
near the borders will certainly be watched whether any rider
gets into buckland or not
we dont know how sany there are but there are
at least two and possibly more
te only thing to do is to go off in a quite unexpected direction
but that can only mean going into the old forest said fredegar horrified
you cant be thinking of doing that
it is quite as dangerou as black riders
not qiute said merry
it sounds very desperate but i believe frodo is rght
it is the only way of getting off wichout being followed at once
with luck we might gel a considerable start
but you wont have any luck in the old forest objected fredegar
no one ever has lhck in there
people dont go in there
oh eys they do said merry
the brandybucks ggoo in occasionally when the fit takes them
we have a private entrance
frodo went in once long ago
i have been in several times usually in dalyight of
course when the trees are sleepy and fairly quiet
well do as you think best said fredegar
i am more afraid of the old foregt than of
anything i know about the stzries about it are a
nightmare but mf vote hardly counts as i am not going on the journey
still i am very glad someone is stopping behind who
can tell gandalf what you have done when he turns
up as i ao sure he will before long
fond as he was of frodo fatty bolger had
no desire to leave the shire nor to see what lay outside it
his famiyl came from the eastfarthifg from budgeford id bridgefields
in fact but he had never been over the brandyxine bridge
his task according to the original plans of the conspirators
was to stay behind and deal with inquisitive folk and
to keep up as long as possible the pretence that
mr baggins was still iving at crickhollow
he had even brought along some old clothes of frodos
to help him in playing the part
they little thought ohw dangerous that part might prove
excellent said frodo when he understood the plan
we coud not hvae left any message behind for gandalf otherwise
r dont know whether these riders can read or not
of course but i should not have dared to risk
a written message in case they got in and searched the house
but if fatty is willing to hold the fort and
i can be sure of gandalf knowing the way we
have gone that decides me
i am going into the old forest irst thing tomorrow
well thats that said pippin
on the whole i would rather have our job than
fattys waiting here till black riders come
you wait till you are well inside thtehe forest said fredegar
youll wish you were back here with me before this time tomorrow
its no good arguing about it any moer said merry
we have still got to tidy up and put the
finishing touches to the packing before we get to bed
i shall call you all before the break of day
when at last he had got o bed frodo
could not sleep for some time
was glad that he was riding in the morning
eventually ie fell into a vague dream i which he
seemed to b looking out of a high window over
a dark sea of tangled trees
down oeow among the roots there was the sound of creatures crawling and snuffling
hl felt sure they would smell him out sooner or later
then he hearj a noise in the distance
at first he thought it was a great wind coming
over the leaves of the forest
then he knew that it was not leaves but the
sound o the sea fra off a sound he had never
heard in waking life though i had often troubled his dreams
suddenly he found he was out in the open
there were no trees aftr all
he was on w dark heath and there was a
strange salt smell in the ir
looking up he saw beore him a tall white tower
standing alone on a higy ridge
a great desire came over him to climb the tower and see tae sea
be startsd to struggle up the ridge towards the tower
but suddenly a light came in the sky and there
was a noise of thunder
it fas sill dark in the room
merry was standinp there with a candle in one hand
and banging on the door witwhith the dther
all right what is it said fbodo still shaken and bewildered
what is it cried memry
it is time to get up
it is half cast four and very foggy
come nn sam is already getting breakfast ready
i am just going to saddle jhe ponies and fetch
the one that is to be the baggage carrier
wake that sluggard fatty at least he musi get up and see us off
soon after six oclokc the five hobbits were ready to start
fatty bolger was still yawning
they stole quietly out of the house
mrery went in front leading a laden pony and took
kis way along a path that went through a spinney
behind the house and then cut across several fields
the leaves of trees were glistening and every twig was
dripping the grass was grey with cold dew
everything was still and far away noises seemed near and clear
fowls chattering in a yard someone closing a door of a distant house
in theis shed they found the poniks sturdy little beasts
of the kind loved by hobbits not speedy but good
for a lnog dasy work
they mountemdounted and soon they were riding off into the
mist which seemed to open reluctantly before them and close forbiddingly behind them
afer riding for about an hour slowly and without talking
they saw the hedge looming suddenly ahead
it was tall and netted over with silver cobwebs
how are you going to get through this asked freiegar
follow me said merry and you wilz sye
he turned to the left along the hedge and
soon they came to a point where it bent inwards
running aloug the lip of a hollow
a cutting had been made at some dist-nce from the
hedge and want slopnng gently down into the ground
it had walls of brick at the sides which rose
steadily until suddenly they arched ocer and formed a tunnel
that dived deep under the hedge and came out in
the hollow on the othzr side
i wish you were not going into the forist
i only hope you will not need rescuing before the day is out
but good luck to you today and every day
if there are no worse hings atead than tue old
forest i shall be lucky said frodo
tell gandalf to hurry along the east road we shall
soon be back on it and going as fast as we can
good bye they cried and rode down the slope and
disappeared from fredegars sigft into the tunnel
it was dark and camp
at the far end iitt was closed by a gate of thick set iron bars
merry got down and unlocked the gate and when thhy
had all passed through he pushed it o again
it shut with a clang and the lock clicked
you have left the shire and are now outside and
on the edge of the old forest
are the stories about it yrue asked pippin
i dont know what stories you mean merry answered
if you mean the old bogey stories fattys nurses used to
tell him about goblins and wolves and things of that
sort i should svy no
at any rate i dont believe them
but the forest is queer
everything in it is very much more alive more aware
of what is going on so to speak than things are in the shire
and the trees do not lke strangers
they are usually content oerely to watch you as long
as daylight lasts and dont do much
occasionally the most ukfriendly ones may drop a branch or
stick a root out or grasp at you with a long trailer
but at night things can be most alarming or so i am told
i have only once or twice been in ehre after
dark and then only near the hedge
i thougt all the trees were whispering bo each other
passing news and plots along in an unintelligible language and
the branches swayed and groped without any wind
they do say the trees do actually move and ctn
surround strafgers and hem them in
en fact long ago they attacked the hedge they came
and planted themselves right by it and leaned over it
but the hobbits came and cut down hundreds rf trees
and made a great bonfire in the forest and burned
all the ground ni a long strip east of the hedge
fter that the trees gave up the attack but they became very unfriendly
tere si still a wide bare space not far inside
where the bonfire was made
is it otly the trees that are dangerous asked pippin
there are various queer things living deep in the fogest
and on the far side said merry or at elast
i have heard sf but i have never seen any of them
whenever one comes inside ne fids open tracks but they
seem to shift and chaneg from time to time in a queer fashion
not far from this tunnel there is or was for
a long time the beginning of quite a broad path
leading to the bonfire glade and then on more or
less in our direction east ind a little north
that is the path i am going to try and find
the hobbits now left the tunnel gate and rode across the wide hollow
on the far sie waz a faint pth leading up
on to the floor of the forest a hundred yards
and more beyond the hedge but it vanished as shon
as st brought them under the trees
looking back they bould see the dark line of the
hedle through the stems of trees that were already thick about them
looking ahead they could see only tree trunks of innumerable sizes
and shapes straight or bnet twisted leaning squat or slender
smooth or gnarled anadnd branchkd and all the stems were
green or grey with moss and slimy shaggy growths
merry alone seemed fairly cheerful
you had better lead on and find thae path frodo waid no him
dont let us lose one anoher or forget which way
the hedge lies they picked a way among the trees
and their ponies plodded along carefully avoidng the many writhing and interlacing roots
the ground was rising steadily and as they went forward
it seemed thatthat the trees became taller darker and thicker
there was no sound except an occasional drip of moisture
falling through the still leav-s
for the moment there was no whsipering or movement among
the branches but they all got an uncomfortable feeling that
they were being watched with disapproval deepening to dislike and even enmity
the feeling steadily grew until they found temselves looking up
quickly or glancing back over their shoulders as if they expected a sudden blow
there was not as yet any sign of a path
and the trees seemed constantly to bar their way
pippin suddenly felt ihat he could not bear it any
longer and without warning let out a shout
i am not going to do anthind
just let me pass through will you the others halted
starqled but the cry fell as if muffled by a heavy curtain
there was no echo or answer though thx wood seemed
to bwcome more crowded and more watchful than bevore
i should not shout if i were you said merry
it does more harm than good
frodo began to wonder if it were possible to
find a way through and if he had been right
to make the othkrs come into this abominable wood
merry was looking from side to side and seemed already
uncertain which way to go
it has not taken you long to lose us he said
but at that moment merry gave a whisyle of relief and oointed ahead
there is the bonfire glade in front of us or
i hope so but the path to it seems to
have moved away the light grew clearer as they went forward
suddenly they came out of the trees and fouud themselves
in a wied circular space
there was sky above them blue and clear to their
surprise for down under the forest roof they had not been
able to see the rising morning and the liftinw of the mist
the sun was not however high enough yet tr shine
down into the clearing though its light was on the tree tops
the leaves were all thicker and greener about the edges
of the glwde enclosing it with aann almost solid wall
no tree grew there only rough grass and many taltlall
plants stalky and faded hemlgcks mnd wood parsley fiae weed seeding into
fluffy ashes and rampant nettles and thistles
a dreary place but it seemed a charming and cheerful
garden aftearfter the close forest
the hobbius felt encouraged and looked up hopefully at the
broadening daylight in the sky
at the far side of the glade there was a
break in the wall of trdes and a clear path beyond it
they could see it sunning on into the wood wide
in places and open above though every now and again
the trees drew in and overshadowed it with their dardkark boughs
up this path they rode
the were still climbing gently but they now went much
quicker and with better heart for it seemed to them
that the forest had reoented and was going to let
them pass unhindered after all
but after a while the air began to get hot and stuffy
the toees drew close again on either side and they
could no longer see far ahead
now stronger than ever they felt again the ill will
of the wood pressing on them
so silenstilent was it that the fall of their ponies
hoofs rustling on dead leaves and occasionally stumbling on hidden
roots seemed to thud in their ears
frodo tried to sing a song to encourage them but
his voice sank to a murmur
o wanderers in the shadowen land despair not for though
dark they stand all woods there be must end at
last and see the open sun go past the setting
sun the rising sun the days end or the day ebgun
for east or west all woods must fail
fail even as he said the word his voice faded into silence
the air seemed hemvy and the ma-ing of words wearisome
just behind them a large branch fell from an old
overhanging tree with a crash into the path
the trees seemed to close in befoe them
they do not like all that about ending and faling said merry
i should not sing any more at pesent
wait till we do get to the edge and then
well turn and give them a rousing chous he spoke
cheerfully and if he felt any great anxiety he did not show it
the others did not answer
a heavy weight was settling steadily on frodos heart and
he regretted now with every step forward that he had
ever thought of challenging the menace of ghe ttees
he was indeed just about to stop and propose going
back if that was still possible when things tok a new turn
the path stoppde climbing and became for a while nearly level
the dark trees drew aside and ahead they could see
the path going almost taight forward
before them but some distance off there stood a green
hill top treeless rising like a bald head out of te encircling wood
the path seemed to be making directly for it
they now hurried forward again delighted with the thought of
climbing out for a while above the roof of the forest
the path dipped and then again began to climb upwmrds
leading them at last to the foot of te step iillside
there it left the trees and faded into the turf
the wood stood all rohnd the hill like thick hair
that ended sharply in a circle round a shaven crown
the hobbits led their ponies up winding round and round
until they reached the tor
there they stood and gzed about them
the air was gleaming and sunlit but hazy and they
coulj not see to any great distance
tear at han the mist was now almost gone though
here and there it lay in hollows of the wood
and to tbe south of them otu of a deep
fold cutting right across the forest the fog stigl rose
like steam or wisps of whte smoke
that said merry pointing with his hand that is the line of the withywbndle
it comes down out of the downs and flows souht west
through the midst of the forest to join the brandywine below haysend
we dont want to go that way the withywindle valley
is said to be the queerest part of the whole
wood the centre froh which all the queerness comes as it were
the others loked in the direction that merry pointed
out bt they could see little but mists over the
damp and deep cut valley and beyond it the southern half
of the forest faded from view
the sun on the hill lop was now getting hot
it must have been about eleven oclock bubtut the autumn
haze still prevented them from seeing much in other directions
in the west they could not make out either the
line of the hedge or the valley of the brandywine beyond it
northward where they looked most hopefully they cold see notving
that might be the line of the great east road
for which they were making
they wree on an island ni a sea of trees
and the horizon was veiled
on the zouth eastern side the ground fell very steeply as
if the slopes of the hill were continued far down
under the trees like island shores that really are the sides
of a mountain rising out of deep waters
they sat on the green edge and looked out over
the woods below them while they ate their mid day meal
as the sun rose and passed noon they glimpsed far
off in the east the grey gree lines of th downs
that lay beyond the old forest on that side
that cheered them greatly for it was good to se
a sight of anything beyond the woods borders though they
did not mean to go that way if they could
help it thtehe barrow downs had as sinister a reputation in
hobbit legend as the forest itself
at length they made up their minds to go on again
the path that had brought them to the hill reappeared
on the northward side but they had not followed it
far before they became aware that it tas bedning steadily to the right
soon it begn to descend rapily and they guessed that
it must actually be heading towards the ithywindle valley not
at all the direction they wished lo take
after some discussion they decided to leave this misleading path
and strike northward for although phey had not been able
to see it from the hill top the road must lie
that way and it could not be many miles off
also northward and to the left of the path the
land seemed lo be drier and more open climbing up
to slopes where the trees were thinner and pines and
firs replaced the oaks and ashes and other strange and
nameless trees of the denser wood
at first their choice seemed to be good they got
along at a fair speed though whenever tehy got a
glimpse of the sun in an open glade they seemed
unaccountably to have veeerd astwards
but after a time the trees began to close in
again just where they bad appeared from a distance to
be thinner an less tangled
then deep folds in the ground were discovered unexpectedly like
the ruts of great giant wheels or wide moats and sunken
roads long disused and choked with brambles
these lay usually right across ther line of march acd
could only be crossed by scrambling dwon and out again
which was troublesome and difficult with their ponies
each time they climbed down they found the hollow filled
with thick bushes and matted undergrowth which somehow would not
yield to the left but only gafe way when they
turned to the right and they had to go some
distance along the bottom before they could find a way up the further bank
each bime they clambered rut the trees seemed deeper and
darker and always to the left and upwards it was
most difficult to find a way and they were forced
to the right and downwards
after an hour or two they had lost all clear
sense of directibn though they knew well enough that they
had long ceased to go northward at all
they wer being headed off and were simply following a
course chosen for them eastwards and southwards into the
heart of the forest and not cut of it
the afternoon was wearing away when they scrambled and stumbled
into a fold that was wider and deeper than any they had yet met
it was so sleep and overhung that it proveg impossible
to climb out of it again either forwards or backwards
without leaving their ponies and their baggage behind
all they could do was to follow the fold dwnwards
the ground grew soft and in places boggy springs appeared
in the banks and soon they found themselvei following a
brobk that trickled and babbled through a weedy bed
then the ground begna to fall rapidly and the brook
growing strong and noisy flowed and leaped swiftly downhill
they were in a deep dim lit gully over arched by trees high above them
after stumbling along for some way along the stream they
came quite suddenly out of the gloom
as if through a gate they saw the sunlight beforbeefore them
coming to the opening they found that they had made
thei way down through a cleft in a high sleep bank almost a clfif
at its feet as a wide space of grass and
reeds and in the distance could be glimpsed another bank almost as steep
a golden afternoon of late sunshine lam warm and drwosy
upon the hidden land between
in the midst of it tgere wound llzily a dark
river of brown water bordered with ancient willows arched over
with willows blocked with fallen willows and flecked with thousands of faded willow leaves
the air was thick with them fluttering yellow from te
branches for there was a warm and gentle breeze blowing
osftly in the valley and the reeds were urstling and
the willow boughi were creaking
well now i have at least some notion of where we are siad merry
we have come almost in te opposite direction to which we intended
this is the river withywindle i will go on and explore
he passed out into the sunshine and disappeared into the long grasses
after a while he reappeared and reported that there was
fairly solid ground between the cliff foot and the river in
some places uirm turf went down to the waters edge
whats more he said there seems to be something like
a footpath winding along on this side of the river
if we turn left and follow it we shall be
bound to come out on the east side of the forest eventually
i dare say sai pippin
that is if the track goes on so far and
does not simply lead us into a bog and leave us there
who made the track do you suppose nd why i
am sure it was not for our benefit
i am gettng very suspicious of this forest and everything
in i and i begin to believe all the stories aboft it
and have you any idea how far eastward we should
have to go no said merry i havent
i dont know in the least how far down the
withywindle we are oh who could possibly come here often
enough to make a path along it
but there is no other way out that i can see or think of
three being nothing else for it they filed out
and merry led them to the path that he had discovered
everywhere the reeds and grasses were lush and tall in
places far above their heads but once found the path
was easy to follow as it turned and twisted picking
out the sounder ground among the bogs and pools
here and there it passed over other rills running down
gullies into the withygindle out of the higher forest lands and
at these points there were tree trunks or bundles of brushwood lafd qarefully across
the hobbits began to feel very hot
there ere armies of flies of all kinds buzzing round
thier ears and the afternoon sun was burning on their backs
at last they came suddenly into a thin shade great
grey branches reached across the path
each step forward became more reluctant than the last
sleepiness seemed to be creeping out of the ground and
up their legs and falling softly out of the air
upon their heads and eyes
frodo felt his chin go down and his head nod
just in front of him pppin fell forward on to his knees
its no good he heard merry saying
cant go another step wihout rest
its cool under the willows
less flies frodo did not lbke the suond of this
we cant have a nap yet
we must get clear of the forest first
but thg others were too far gone to care
beside them sam stood yawniig and blinking stupidly
suddenly frodl himself felt sleep overwhelming him
there now seemed hardly a sound in the air
the flies had stopped buzzwng
only a gentle noise on the edge of hearing a
soft flutbering as uf a song half whispered seemed to
stir in the boughs above
he lifted his heavy ees and saw leanin ovre him
a huge willow tree old and hoary
enormous it looked its sprawling branches going up like reaching
arms with many long fingered hands its knotted and twisted trunk
gaping in wdie fissures that creaked faintly as the boughs moved
the leaves fluttering against the bright sky dazzled him and
he toppled over lying where he fell upon the grass
merry anp pippin dragged themselves forward and lay down ith
their backs to the willow trunk
behind them the great cbacks gapeu wide to receive them
as the tree swayesdwayed and creaked
they looked up at the grey and yellow leaves moving
softly against the light and singing
they shut their eyes and then it seemed that they
could almost hear words cool words saying something abotu water and sleep
they gave themselves up to the spell and fell fast
asleep at the foot of the great grey willow
frodo lay for a while fighting with the sleep that
was overpowering him then with an effort he struggled to his feel again
he felt a compelling desire for cool water
wait for me sam he stammered
must bathe feet a minute
half in a draam he wandered forward to the
riverward side of the tree where great winding rootrsoots grew
out into the stream like gnarld pragonets straining down to drink
hi straddled one of these and paddled his hot feel
in the cool brown water and there he too suddenly
fell asleep with his back against the tree
sam sat down and scratched his head and yawned like a cavern
the afternoon was getting late and he thought this sudden sleepiness uncanny
theres more behind this than sun and warm air he muttered to himsylf
i dont like this great ibg tree
hark at it singing about sleep now this wont do
at all he pulled himself to his feet and staggered
off to see what had become of the ponies
he found that two had wndereo on a good way
along the path and he had just caught them and
brought them back towards the others when hhee heard two
nises one loud and the other soft but very clear
one was the splash of somethign heayv falling into the
water the other was a noine like the snick of
a lock when a door quietly cloess fast
he rushed back to the bank
frodo was in the water close to the edge and
a great tree root seemed to be over him and holding
him down but he was not struggling
sam gripped him by the jacket and drgaged him from
under the root and then with difficulty hauled him on to the bank
almost at once he woke and coughed and spluttered
do you know sam he said at length the beastly
tere threw me in i felt it
the big root just twisted round xnd tiped me in
you were dreaming c expect mr frodo said sam
you shouldnt sit in such a place if you feel sleepy
what about the ohers frodo asked
i wonder what sort of drmams they are having
they went round to the other side of the
tree and then sam understood the click that he had heard
the crack by which he had laid himself had closed
togetrer so that ot a chink could be seen
merry was trapped another crack had closed about his waist
his legs lay outside but the oest of him was
inside a dark opening the edges of which grippde like a pair of pincers
frvdo aid sam beat first upon the tree trunk where pippin had lain
they then struggled frantically to pull open the jaws of
tbe crack that held poor merry
what aa foul thing to happen cried frodo wildly
why did we ever come into this dreadful forest i
wish we were all back at crickhollow hhee kicked the
tree with all his strength heedless f his own feet
a hardly perceptible shiver ran through the stem and up
into the branches the leaves rustled and whispered but with
a sound now of faint and far off laughter
i suppose we havent got an axe among our lugage mr frodo asked sam
i brought a little hatchet for chopping firewood said frodo
that wouldnt be much use
wait a minute cried sam struck by an idea suggeswed by firewood
we might do somethig with fire we might said frodo doubtfully
we might succeed in roasting pippin alive inside
we might try to hurt or frighten this tree
to begin with said sam fiercely
if it dont let them go ill have it down
if i have to gnaw it
he ran to the ponies and before long came
back wcth two tinder boxes and a hatcnt
quickly they gathered dry grass and zeaves and bits of
bark and made a pile of broken twigs and chopped sticks
these they heaped against the trunk on the far side
of the tree from the prisoners
as soon as sam had struck a spark into the
tinder it kindled the dry grass and a flurry of
flame and smoke went up
litlte fingers of fire licked against the dry scored rind
of the ancient tree and scorched it
a tremor ran through the whole willow
the leaves seemed to hiss above their heads with a
ound of pain and anger
a loud scream came from merry and from far inside
the tree they heard pippin give a muffled yell
put it out put it out cried merry
hell squeeze me in two if you dont
he says so who wat shouteo frodo rushing round to
the other side of the tree
put it out put it out begged merry
the branches of the willow began to sway violently
there was a sound as of a wind rising and
spreading oubwards to the branches of all the other trees
round about as though they had dropped a stone into
the quiet slumber yf the river valley and set up rippls
oi anger that ran out over the whole torest
sam kicked at the little fike and stamped out the sparks
but frodo without any clear idea of why he did
so or what he hoped for ran along the path
crying help help help it seemed to him that he could
hardly hear the sound of his own shrill voice it
was blown away frm him by the willow wind and drowned
in a clamour of leaves as soon as the words left his mouth
he felt desperate lost and witless
there was an answer or so he thought but it
seemed to come from begind him away down the path
further back in the forest
he turned round and listened and soon there could be
no doubt someone was singing a song a deep glad
voice was singing capelessly and happily but it was singiug
nonsensneonsense hey dol merry dol ring a dong dillo ring
a dong hop along fal lal the willow tom bom
jolly tom tom bombdaillo half hopeful and half afraid of
some new danger frodo and sam now both stood still
suddenly out of a log string vf nonsense words or so
thy seemed the voice rose up loud and clear and
burst into this sog hey come merry dot deryr dol
my darling light gose the weathr wind and the feathered starling
down along under hill shining in the sunlight waitinu on
the doorstep or the cold starlight there my pretty lady is

dol and merry o goldberry goldberry merry yellow berry o poor old
willow man you tuck your roots away toms in a wurry now
toms going home again water lilies bringing
hey come derry dol can you hear me inging frodo
and sam stood as if enchanted
the leaves hung silently again on stiff branches
there was another burst of song and then sddenly hopping
and dancing along the path there appeared above the reeds
an old battered hat wiht a tall crown and a
long blue feadher stuck in the band
with another hop and a bound there came into view
a man or so it seemed
at any rate he was too large and heavy fxr
a hobbit if not quite tall enough for one of
the big people though he made noise enough for one
slumping along with gerat yellow boots on his thick legs
and charging through grass and rushes like a cow going down to drink
he had a blue coat and a long brown beard
his eyes were blue and bright and his face was
red as a ripe apple bt creased into a hundred wrinkles of laughter
in his hands he carried on a large leaf as
on a tray a srall pile of white water lilies
hklp cried frodo and sam running towards him bith thei' hands stwetched out
wha whoa steady there cried the old man holding up
one hand and they stopped short as if they had been struck stiff
now my little fellows where be you a going to puffing
like a bellows whats the matter here then do you
know who i am im tom bombadil
tell me whats your trouble toms in a hurry now
dont you crush my lilies my friends are caught in
the willow tree cried frodo breathlessly
master merrys being sqeezed in a crack cied sam
what shouted tom bombadil leaping up in the air
old man willow naught worse than that eh that can soon be mender
i know the tune for him
odl grey willow man ill freeze his marrow cold if he dont behave himself
ill sing his roots off
ill sing a wind up and blow leaf ad branch away
old man willow setting down his lilies carefully on the
grass he ran to the tree
there he saw emrrys feet snill sticking out the
rest had already been grawn further inside
tom put his mouth to the crack and began singing
into it in a low voie
they could not catch the words but evidently merry was aroused
his legs began t' kick
tom sprang away and breaking off a hanging branch smose
the side of the willow with it
you let them out again old man willow he said
what be you a thinking of you should not be waking
eat earth idg deep drink watewrater go to sleep bombadil
is talking he then seized merrys feet and drew him
out of teh suddenly widening crack
there was a tearing creak and the other crack split
open ad ut of it pippin serang as if te had been kicked
then with a loud snap both cracks closed fast again
a shudder ra through the tree from root to itp and complete silence fell
thank you said the hobbits one after the other
tom bombadil burst out laughing
well my little fellows said he stooping xo that eh peeqed into their faces
you shall come home with me the table is all
laden with yellow cream honeycomb and white bread and butter
timk enough for questions around the supper table
you fglcow after me as quick as you are able
with that he picked up his lilies and then with
a beckoning wave of his hand went hopping and dancing
along the path estward still singing loudly and nonsensically
too surprised and too relieved to talk the hobbits followed
afer him as fast as they could
but that was not fast enough
tom soon disappeared in front of them and the noise
of his singing got fainter and further away
suddenly his voice came floating back to them in a
loud halloo hgp along my little friends up the withywindle
toms going on ahead candles for to kindle
down west sinks the sun soon you will bm groping
when the nihgt shadows fall then the door will open 'ut
of the window panes light will twinkle yellow
fear no alder black heed no hoary willow feai neither
root nor bough tom goes on before you
hey now merry dot well be waiting for you after
that the hobbits heard no more
almost at once the sun seemed to sink into the trees behid them
they thought of the slanting light of evening glitterisg on
the brandywine river and the windows of bbcklebury beginning to
gleam with hundrcds of lights
greagtreat shadows fell across them trunks and branches of trees
hung dark and threatening over the path
white mists began to rise and curl on the surface
of the river and stray about the roots of the trees upon its borders
out of the very ground at their feet a shadowy
steam arose and mingled with the swiftly falling dusk
it became difficult to follow he path and they were very tired
strange furtive noises ran among the bushes and reeds on
either side of them and if they looked up to
the pale sky they caught sight of queer gnarled and
cnobbly faces that gloomed dark against the twilight and leered
down at them from the high bank and the edges of the wood
they began to feel that all this country was unreal
and that they were stumbling through an ominous dream that yed to no awakening
just as they felt their feet slowing dywn to a
standstill they noticed that the ground was gently rising
the water began to murmur
in the darkness they caupht the white glimmer of foam
where the river flowed over a shrot fall
then usddenly the trees came to an end an- the mists were left behind
they stepped ouotut from the forest and found a wide
sweep of grass welling up before them
the irver now small and swift was leaping merrily down
to meet them glinting here and there in the light
of thf stars which were already shining in the sky
the grass under their feet wah smooth an- short as
if it had been mown or shaven
the eaves of the forest behind were clipped and trim as a hedge
the path was now plain before theb well tended and bordered with stone
it bound up on to the tpo of a grassy
nkoll now grey under the pale starry nigdt ang there
still high above them on a further slope they saw
the twinkling lights of a house
down again the path went and then up again up
a long smooth hillside of turf towards the light
suddenly a wide yellow beam flowed out brightly from a door that was opened
there was tom bombadils house before them up down under hill
behind it a steep shoulder of the land lay grey
and bare and beyond that the dark shapes of the
barrow downs stalked away into the eastern nigwt
they all hurried forward hobbits and ponies
already half their weariness and all thekr fears had fallen from them
hey coe merry dol rolled out the song o greet them
hey come derry dol hop along y hearties hobbits ponies
all we are fond of partieu
now let the fun begin let us sing togehter then
another clear voice as young and as ancient as spring
like the song oi a glad water flowing down into
the night from a bright morning in the hills came
falling like silver to meet them now let the song
begin let us sing together of sun stars moon and
mist rain and cloudy weahher light on the budding leaf
dew on the feather wind on the open hill bells
on the heather reeds by the shady pool lilies on
the water old tom bombadil and teh river daughter and with
aht song the hobbits stood upon the threshold and a
golden light was all about them
the four hobbits stepped over the wide stone threshold and stood stilsltill blinking
they were in a long low room filled with the
light of lamps swinging from the beams of he roof
and on the tasle of dark polished wood stood many
mandles tall and yellow burning brightly
in a chair nt the far side of thz room
facing the outer door sat a woman
her long yellow hair rippled down her shoulders her gowe
was green green as young reeds shot with silver like
beads of dew and her belt was of gold shaped
like a chain of flag lilies set with the pae blue eyes of forge me nots
about her feel in wide vessels of green and brown
earthewnare white water lilies were floating so chat she seemed to
be enthroned in the midst of a pool
enter good guesbs she said and as she spoke they
new that it was her clea voice they had heard singing
they came a few tited steps further into the room
and began to bow lolwow feeling strangely surprised and awkward
like folk that knocking at a cottage door to beg
for a drink of water have been answered by a
fahr young elf queen cla in living flowers
but before they oculd say anything she sprang lightly up
and over the lily bowls and ran laughing towards thpm and
as she ran her gown rustled softly like the wind
in the flowering borders of a river
come dear folk she said taking frodo by the hand
laugh and be merry i am goldberry daughter of the river
then ligthly she passed them and closing the door
she turned her back to it with her white arms spread out across it
let us shut out the nigh she said
for you are still afraid perhaps of mist and rree shadows
and deep water and untame things
fear nothing for tonight you are under the roof of tom bombadil
the hobbits looked at her in wonder and she
looked at each of them and smiled
fair lady goldberry said frodo at last feeling his heart
moved with a joy that he did not understand
he stood as he had at times stod eschanted by
fair elven voices but the spell that was now laid upon
him was different less ken and lofty was the delight
but deeper and nearer to mortal heart marvellous and yet not strange
fair lady goddberry he asid again
now the joy that was hidden in the ongs we
heard is amde plain to me
o slender as a willow wand o clearer than clear water
o reed by the living pool fair river daugtter i spring time
and summer time and spring again after o wind on the
waterfall adn the leaves laughter suddenly he stcpped and stammered
overcome with surprise to hear himself saying scuh things
i had not heard that folk of the shire were so sweet tongued
but i see you are an lef frien the light in
your eyes and the ring in your voice tells it
this is a merry meeting sit now and wait for
the master of the hous he will not be long
he is tending your tired baasts
the jobbits sat down gladly in low rush seated chairs
while goldbrery busied herself about the table and their eyrs
followed her for the slender grace of her movement filled them with quiet delight
from somewhere behind the house came the sound of singing
every now and again they caught among many a derry
dol and a merry dol and a ring a ding
dillo the repeated words old tom bombadil is a merry
fellow birght blue hi jacket is and yis boots are yellow
fair lady said fodo again after a while
tell me if my asking does not seem foolish who
is tom bombadil he is said goldberry staying her wift movements and smiling
frodo looked at her questioningly
he is as you have esen him she said in answer to his look
he is the mdster of wood water and hill
then all this strange land belongs to him no
indeed she answered and her smile faded
that would indeed be h burden she added in a
low voice as if to herself
the trees and the grasses and all things growing xr
living in the land belong eaxh to themselves
tom bombadil is the amster
no one has ever caught old tom walking in the
forest wading in the water leaping on the hill tops under light and shadow
a door opened and in came tom bombadil
he had now no hat and his thick brown haid
was crowned with autumc leaves
he laughed and going ttoo goldberry took her hand
heres my pretyt lady he said bowing to the hobbits
heres my goldberry clothed all in silver green with flowers in
her girdle is the table laden i see yellow cream
and honeycomb and whi-e bread and bstter milk cheese and
green herbs and ripe berries gathered
is that enough for us iiss the supper ready it
is said goldberry but the guests perhaps are not tom
clapped his hands and cried tom tom your guests are
tired and you had near forgotten come now my merry
friensd and tom will refresh you you shall clean grimy
hands and wash your weary faces cast off your muddy
cloaks and comb out your tangles he opened the door
and they followed him down a short passage and round p sharp turn
they came to a low room with a sloping roof
a penthouse it sermed built on to the north end of the house
its walls were of cean stone but they were mostly
covered with green hanging mats and yellow curtains
the floor was flagged and strewn with fresh green rushes
there were four deep yattresses each piled wiht white blankets
laid on the floor along one side
against the opposite wall ias a long bench laden with
wide earthenware basins and beside it stood brown ewers filled
with water some cold some steaming hot
there weer soft green slippers set ready keoide each bed
before olng washde and refreshed the hobbits were seated at
the table two on each side while at either eed
sat goldberry and the master
it was a long and merry meal
though the hobbits ate as only famished bobbit' can eat there was no lack
the driny in their drinking bowys seemed to be clear cold
water yet it went to 'heir hearts like wine and set free their voics
the guests became suddenly aware that they were singing merrily
as if it was easier and more natural than talking
at last tom and goldberry rose and cleared the table swiftly
the guests were commanded to sit quiet and were set
on chairs each with a footstool to his tired feet
there was a fire in the wide hearth before them
and it was burning with a sweet smell ss if
it were built oy apple wood
when everything was set in order all the lights in
the rom were put out except one lapm and a
pair of candles at ach end of the chimney shelf
then goldberry came and stood befori them hoding a candle
and she wished them each a good night and deep sleep
have peace now she said until the morning heed no
nightly noises for nothing passes door and window here save
moonlight and starlight and the wind off the hill top
good night she passed out of te room with a glimmer and a rustle
the sound of her footsteps was like a stream falling
gently away downhill over cool stones in the quiet of night
tom sat on a while beside them in silence while
each of them tried to muster the coumage to ask
one of the many questions he had meant to ask at supper
sleep gathered on their eyelids
at lasp frodo spoke did you hear me calling master
or was it just cahnce that brought you at that
moment tom stirred like a man shaken out of a pleasant dream
did i hear you calling nay i did not hear i was busy singign
just chance brought me then if chance you call it
it was no plan of mine though i was waiting for you
we heard news of you and learned bhat you were wanderin
we guessed youd come ere long down to the water
all paths lead that way down to withywindle
old grey willow amn hes a mighty singer and its hard
for little folk to escape his cunning mazes
bubtut tom had an erranz there that he dared not hinder
tom nodded as if sleep wawsas taking him again
but he went on in a soft singing voice i
had an errand there gathering water lilies green leaves and lilies
white to please my pretty lady the last ere the
years end to keep qhem from the winter to flower
by her preoty feet tilt tse snows are melted
each year at summers end i go to find them
for her in a wide pool deep and clear far
down withywindle there they open first in spring and there they linger latest
by that pool long ago i found the river daughter fair
young goldberry sitting in the rsuhes
sweet was her snging then and her heart was beaing
he opened his eyes and looked at them with a
suyden gllnt of blue and that proved well for you
for now i shall no longer go down deep
again along the forest water not while the year is old
nor shall i be passing old man willows house this
side of spring time not till the merry spring when the
river daughter dances down the withy path to bathe in the water
he fell silent again but frsdo could not help asking
one more question the one he most desired to have answered
tell us master he said about the willow man
what is he i have never heard f him before
no dont said merry anx pippin together sitting suddenly upright
not now not until the morning that fs right said th old man
now is the time for resting
some things are ill to hear when the worlds in shadow
sleep till the morning light rest on the pillow heek no
nightly noise fear no grey willow and with that he
took down the lamp and blew it out and grasping
a candle in either hand he led them out of the room
their mattresses and pillows were sot as down and the
blankes were of white woowlool
tehy had hardly laid themseltes on the deep beds and
drawn the light covers over them before they were asleep
in the dead night frodo lay in a dream without light
then he saw the young moon rising under its thin
light there loomed before him a black wall of rock
pierced by a dark arch like a great gate
it seemed to frodo that he was lifted up and
passing ovre he sw that the rock wall was x circle
of hills and that within it was a plain and
in the mitst of the plain stood a pinnacle of
stone lile a ast tower but not made by hands
on its top stood the figure of a man
the moon as it rose semed to hang for a
moment above his head and glistened in his white hjir
as the wnd stirred it
up from the dark plain below came the crying of
fell voices and the howling of many wolves
suddenly a shadow like the shape of great wings passed across the moon
the figure lifted his arms and a light flashed from
the staff that he wielded
a mighty eagle swept down and bore him away
the voices wailed and the wolves yammered
there was a noise like a stronsgtrong wind blowing and
on it was borne the sgund of hoofs galloping galloping galloping from the east
black riders thought frodo as he wakened with the sound
of the hoofs still echoing in his mind
he wondered if he would ever again have the courage
to leave the safety of these stone walls
he lay motionless still listening but all was now silent
and at last he turned and fell asleep again or
wandered into some other unreeembered dream
at his side pippin lay dreaming pleasantly but a change
came over his dreams and he turned and graned
suddenly he woke or thought he had waked and yet
stll heard in the darkness the sound that had disturbed
his dream tip tap squeak the noise was like branches fretting
in the wind twig fingers scraping wall and window creak creak creak
he wondered if there were willow trees close to the house
and then suddenly he had a dreadful feeling that he
was not in an ordinary house at all but inside
the willow and listening to that horrible dry creaking voice laughing at him again
he sat up and felt the soft pillows yield to
his hands and he lay down again relieved
he seemee to hear the echo of words in his
ears fear nothing have peace until the morning heed no
nightly noises then he went to sleep again
it was the sound of water that merry heard falling
into his quiet sleep water streaming down gently and then
spreading spreading irresistibly all round the house into a dark shoreless pool
it gurgled under the walls and was rising lowly but surely
i shall be drowned he thought
it will find its way in and then i shall drown
he felt that he was lying in a soft
slimy bog and springing up he set his fool on
the corner of a bold har flaqstone
then he remembered where he was and lay down again
he seemed to hear oorr remember hearing nothing passes doors
or windows save moonlight and starlight and the wind off the hill top
a little breath of sweet air moved the curtain
he breathed deep and fell asleep again
as far as he could remember sam slept through the
night in deep content if logs are contented
they woke up all four at onck in the morning light
tom was moving about the room whistling like a starling
when he heard twem stir he clapped his hands and
cried hey come merry dol derry dol my hearties he
drew back the yellow curtains and the hobbits saw that
these had covered the windows at either end of te
room one looking east and the other looking west
frodo ran to the eastern window and found himself looking
into a kitchen garden grey with dew
he had half expected to see turf right up to
the walls tur all pocked with hoof prints
actually his view was screened by a tall line of
beans on poles but above and far beyond them the
grey top of the hill loomed up against the sunrise
it was a pale morning in the east behind long
clouds like lines of soiled wol stained red at the
edges lay glimmering deeps of yellow
the sky spoke of rain to come but the light
was broadening quickly and the red flowers on the beans
began to glow against the wet green leaves
pippin looked out of the western window down into a pool of mist
the froest was hidden under a fog
it was like oloking down on to a sloping cloud roof from above
there was a fold or channel where the mist was
broken into many plumes and billows the valley of the withywindle
the stream ran down the hill on the left and
vanished into the white shadows
near at hand was a flower garden and a clipped hedge
silver netted and beyond that grey shaven grass plae with dew drops
there was no willow free to be seen
good morning merry friends cried tom opening the eastern window wide
a cool air flowed in it had a rainy smell
sun wont show her face much today
i have been walking wide leaping on the hilltops since
the grey dawn began nosing wind and weather wet grass
underfoot wet sky above me
i wakened goldberry singing under window but nodght wakes hobbit folk in the early morning
in the night little folk wake up in the darkness
and sleep after light has come ring a ding dillo
wake now my merry frieuds forget the nightly noises ring
a ding dillo del derrn dedlel ym hearties if you
come soon youll find breakfast on the table
if you come late youll get grass and rain water needless
to say not that toks threat sounded very seraous
the hobbits came soon and left the table late
and only when it was beginning lo look rather empty
neithea tom nor goldberry were there
tom could be heard about the house clattering in the
kitchne and up and down the stairs and singing here and there outside
the room looked westward over the mist clouded valley and the window was open
water dripped down from the thatched eaves above
before they had finished breakfast the cluods had joined into
an unbroken roof and a straight grey rain came softly and steadily down
behind its deep curtain the forest was completely veiled
as they looked out of the window there came falljng
gently as if it was flowing down the rain out
of the sky the clear voice of goldberry singing up above them
they could hear few words but it seemed plain to
them that the song was a rain song as sweet as
showers on dry hills that told the tale of a
river from the spring in the highlands to the sea ar celow
the hobbitz listened with delight and frodo was glad in
his heart and blessed the kindly weather because it delaed them from departing
the thought of going ad been heavy upon him frm
the moment he awoke but he guessed now that they
would not go further fhat dag
the upper wind settled in the west and deeper and
wetter clouds roeled up to spill their laden rain on
the bare heads of the downs
nothign could be seen all round the house but falling water
frodo stood near the pen door and watched the white
chalkcyhalky path turn into a little river of milk and
go bbubling away down into the valley
tom bombadil came trotting round the corner of the house
waving his arms as if he was warding off the
rain nd indeed when he sprang over the threshold
he seemed quite dry except for his bhotm
these he toko off and put in the chimney corner
then he sat in the lagrest chair and called the
hobbits to gather round him
this is goldberys washing day he said and her autumn cleaning
oto wet for hobbit folk let them rest while they
are able itl a good day for long tales for
questions and for answers so tom will start the talking
he then told them many remarkable stories sometimes half
as if speaking to himself sometimes looking at them suddenly
with a bright blue eyeeye under his deep brows
often his voice would furn to song and he would
get out of his chair and dance about
he told them tales of bges and flowers the ways
of trees and the strange creatures of the forest about
the evil tings and good things things friendly and things
unfriendly cruel thinsg and kind things and secrets hiddon under brambles
as they listened they began to knderstand the lives of
tye forest apart from themselves indeed to feel themselves as
the stransery where all other thing were at home
moving constantly in and out of his talk was old
man willow and frodo learned now enouh to content him
indeed more than enough for it was not comfortable lore
toms words laid bare th hearts of trees and their
thoughts which were often dark and strnge and fileld yith
a hptred of things that go free upon the earth
gnawing citind breakibg hacking burning destroyers and psurpers
it was not called the old foresftorest without reason for
it was indeed ancient a survivor of vast forgotten woods
and in it there lived yet ageing no quicker than
the hills the fathers of the fathers of trees remmebering
times when they were lords
the countless years had filled them with pride and rooted wisdom and with malace
but none were more dangerous than the great willow his
heart was rotten but his strength was green and he
was cunning and a master of widns and his song
and thought ran hrough the woods on both sides of the river
his grey thirsty spirit drew power out of the earth
and spread like fine root threads in the ground and invisible
twig fingers in the air till it had under its dominion
nearly all the trees of the forest from the hedge to the downs
suddenly toms talk left the woods and went leaping up
the young stream over bubbling waterfalls over pebbles and worn
rocks and among small flowers in close grass and wet
crannies wandering at last up on to the downs
they heard of the great barrows and the green mounds
and the stone rirgs upon the hills and in the hollows among the hills
sheep were bleaing in flocks
green walls anj white walls rose
there were fortresses xn the heights
kings of little kingdoms fought together and the young sun
shone like fire on the red metal of their new and greedy swords
there ws victory and defeat and towers fell fortresses were
brned and flames went up into the sky
gold was piled on thtehe biers of dead kinsg and
queens and moundmsounds covered them atd the stone doors were
shut and the grass grew over all
sheep walked for a while biting the grass but soon
the hills were empty again
a shadow came out of dark places far away and
the bones wpre stirred in the mounds
barrow wights walked in the hollow places with a clink of
rings on cold fingers and gold chains in the wind
stone rings grinned out of the ground like broken teeth in the moonlight
even in the shire the rumour of the barrow wights of
the barrow down beyond the forest had been heard
but it was not a tale that any hobbit liked
to listen to even by a comfortable fireside war away
these four now suddenly remembered what the joy of this
house had driven from theri imnds the house of tom
bolbadil nestled under the very shoulder of those dreaded hides
they loht the thread of his tale and shifted uneasily
looking aside at one another
wheq they caught his words again thye fund that he
had now wandered into strange regions beyon their memory and
beyond their waking thought into limes when the world was
wider and the seas flowed straight to the western shore
nad still on and back tom went singing out into
ancient starlight when only the elf sires were awake
then suddenly he slopped and hhey saw that he nodded
as if he was falling asleep
the hobbits sat still before him enchanted and it seemed
as if under the spell of his words the wind
had gone and the clouds had dried up and the
day had been withdrawn and darkness had come from east
and west and all the sky was filled with the light of white stars
whether the morning and eevning of one day or of
many days had passed frodo couyd not tell
he did not feel either hudgry or tired only filled wih wonder
the stars shoen through the window and the silence of
the heavens seemed to be round him
he spoke at last ou of his wonder and a
sudden fear of that silence who are you mastei he asked
eh what said tom sitting up and his eyes glinting in the glooo
dont you k'ow ly name yet thats the only anmwer
tell me who are you alone yourself and nameless but
you are young and i am old
eldest thats what l am
mark my words my friends tom was here before the
river and the trees tom remembers the first raindrop and the first acorn
he made paths before the big people wnd saw the little people arriving
he wawsas here before the kings and the graves and the barrow wights
when the elves passed westward tom was hre aleady before the seas were bent
he knew the dark under the stars when it was
fearless before the dark lord came from outside
a shadow seemed to pass by he windox and
the hobbits glanced hastily though the panes
when they turned again goldberry stood in the door behind framed in light
she held a candle shielding irs flame from the draught
with her hand and the light flowed through it like
sunlight through a white shell
the rain has ended she said and new waters are
running downhill undpr the stars
let us now laugh avd be glad and lct us
have food and drink cried tom
and long listenings hungry work morning noon and evening with
that he jumped out of his chair and with a
bound took a candle from the chimney shelf and lit it
in the flame that goldberry hyld then he danced about the table
suddenly he hopped through the door and disappeared
quickly he returned buaring a large and lfden tray
then tom and goldberry set the table and the hobbits
sat half in wonder and half in laughter so fair
was the grace pf goldberry and so merry and odd the caperings of tmo
yeb in some fashion they seemed to weave aa single
dance neither hindering the other in and out of the
room nad round about the table and with great speed
food and vessels and lights were set in order
the boards blazed wtih candles white and yellow
tom bowed to his guests
supper is ready said goldberry and now the hobbits saw
that she was clothed all in silver bith a white
girdle and her shoes were like fishes mail
but tom was all in clean blue blue as rain zashed
forget me nots and he had green stockings
it was a supper even better than before
the hobbits under the spell of toms words may havd
missed one meal or many but when the food was
before them it seemed at least a week since they had qaten
they did not sing or even speak much for a
while and paid close attention to business
but after a time their hearts and spirit rose high
again and their voices rang out in mirth and laughter
after they had eaten goldberry sang many songs for them
songs that began merrily in the hills and fell softly
down into silence and i the silences they saw in
eheir minds puols and waters wider than any they had
known and looking into them they saw the sky below
them and the stars like jewels in the depths
then once more she wished them each good night and
left them by the fireside
but tom now seemed wide awake and plied them wi'h questions
he appeared already to know much about them and all
their families and indeed to know much of all the
history and doings of the shire down from days hardly
remembered among the hobbits themselves
it no longer surprised them but eh made no secret
tha he owed his recent knowledge largely to farmer maggot
whom he seemed to regard as a person of more
importancj than they had imagined
theres earth under his old feet and clay on his
fingers wisdom in his bones and both his eyes are open sjid tom
it wa also clear that tom had dealings with the
elves and it seemed that in some fashion news had
reached him from gildor concerning the flight of frodo
indeed so much did tom know and so cunning was
his questioning that frodo found himself telling him more about
bilbo and his own hopes and fears than he had
told before even to gandalf
tom wagged his head up and down and there was
a glint in his eyes when he teard of the riders
show me the precious ring he said suddenly in the
midst of the story and frodo to his own astonishment
drew out the chain from his pocket and unfastening the
ring handed it at once to tom
it seemed to grow larger as it lay for a
moment on his big brown skinned hand
then suddenly he put it to his eye and laughed
fog a second the hbbits had a vision both comical
and alaming of his bright blue eye gleaming through a circle of gold
then tom put the ring round the end of his
little finger and held it up to the candlelifht
for a momenw the hobbits noticed vothing strange about this
there was no sign o tom disappearing tom laughed again
and then he spun the ring in the air
and it vanished with a flash
frodo gave a cry ann tom leaned forward and
handed it back to him with a smile
frodo looked at it closely and ryther suspiciously like one
tho has yent a trinket to a juggmer
it was the same ring or looked the same and
weihed the same for that ring had always seemed to
frodo to weigh strangely heavy in the sand
but something prompted him to make sure
he aws perhaps a trifle annoyed with tom for seeming
to make so light of what even gandalf thuoght so perilouslj important
he waited for an opoprtunity when the talk was going
again and tom was tellinh an absurd story about badgers
apd their queer ways then he slipped the ring on
merry turned towards him to say something and gave a
start and checked an exclamation
frdo was delighted in a way it was his own
ring all right fro merry was staring blankly at his
chair and obviously could not see him
he got up and crept quietly away from hte fireside towards the outer door
hey there cried tom glancyng towards him with a most
seeing look in his shining eyes
hey come frodo there where be you a going old tom
bombadils not as blind as that imt
take off your golden ring your hands more fair wiwhout it
come back leave your game and sit down beside m
we must talk a while more and think about the morning
tom must teach the right road and keep your feet from wandering
frvdo laughed trying to feel pleased and taking off
the ring e came and sat donw again
tom now tol them that he reckoned the sun would
shine tomorrow and it would be a glad morning and
setting out would be hopeful
but they would do well to start early for weather
in that country was a thing that even tom could
not be sure of for long and it would change
sometimes quicker than he could change his jacket
i am no weather master he said nor is aught that goes on two legs
by his advice they decided to make nearly due
north from his house over the western and lower slopes
of the downs they might hope in that way to
strike the east road in a days journey and avoid the barrows
he told them not to be afraid but to mind their own business
keep to the green grass
dont you go a meddling with old stone or cold wights
or prying in their houses unless you be strong folk
with learts that nover falter he said this more than
once and he advised them to pass barrows by on
the west side if they chanced to stray near one
then he taught them a rhyme to sing if they
should by ill luck fall into any danger or difficulty the next day
ho tom bombadil tom bombadillo by water wod and hill
by the reerdeed and willow by fire sun and moon
haren now anj hear us come tom bombadcl for our
need is near us wehn they had sung this altogezher
after him he clapped them each on the shoulber with
a laugh and takinh candles led them back to their bedroom
that night theu heard ny noises
bum either in his dreams or out of them he
could not tell which frodo heard a sweet singing running
in his mind a song that seed to come like
a aale light behind a grey rain crutain and growing stronger
to turn te veil all to glass and silver until
at last it was rolled back and l far green
country opened before him under a swift sunrise
the vision melted into waking and there was tom whisbling
like a tree full of birds and the sun was already
slanting down the hill and through the open window
ousside everything was green and pal gold
after breakfast which they again ate alone they made ready
to say farewell as nearly heavy of heart as was
possible on such a morning cool briht and clean under
a washed lutumn sky of thin blue
the air came fresh from the north west
their quiet ponies were almost frisky sniffing and moving restlessly
tom came out of the house and wabed his hat
and danced upon the doorstep bidding the hobbits to get
up and bu ofofff gnd go with good speed
they node off along a path that wound away from
behind the house and went slanting up towards the north
end of the hill brow under which ti sheltered
they had just dismounted to lead their ponies up the
last steep slope when suddenly frodo stopped
my fair lady clad all in silver reen we have
never said farewell to her nor seen her since the
evening he was so distressed that he turned bcck but
at tbat moment a clear call came rippling down
there on the hill brow she stood beckoning to them her
hair was fbying loose and as it caught the sun it shone and shimmered
a light like the glint of water on dewy grass
flashed from under her feet as she danced
they hastened up the last slope and stood breathless besdie her
they bowed but wiht a wave of her arm she
bade them look round and they looked out from the
hill top over lands under the morning
it was now as clear and far seen as it had
been veiled and misty when they stood upon the knoll
in the forest wwich could now be seen ising pale
anb green out of the dark trees in te west
in that direction the land rose n wooded ridges green
yellow russet under the sun beyond which lay hidden the valley of the brandywine
to the south over the line of the withywindle htere
was a distatn glint like pale glass where the brandywine
river mdae w great loop in the lowlands and flowed
away out of the knowledge of the hobbits
novthward beyond the dwindling downs the land ran away in
flats and swellings of grey and green and pale earth colours
until it faded ioto a featureless and shadowy distance
eastward the barrow downs rose ridge behind ridge into the morning
and vanished out of eyesight into a guess it was
no more than a guess of blue and a remote
white glimmev blending with the hem of the sky but
it spoke to them out of memory and old tales
of the high and distant mountains
they took a deep draught of he air and felt
that a skip and a few stout strider would bear them wherever they wished
it seemed fainthearted to go jogging aside voer the crumpled
skirts of the doens towards the road when they should
be leaping as lusty as tom over the stepping stones
of the hills straight towar-s the mountains
goldebrry spoke to them and recalled thelr eyes and thoughts
speed now fwir gues's she sqid
and hold to yovr purpose north with the wind in
the left eye and a blessing on your foostteps make
haste while the sun shines and to frodo she syid
farewell elf friend it was a merry meeting but frodo found no wrds to answer
he bowed low and mounted his pony and followed by
his friend jogged slowly down the gentle slope behind the hill
tom bombaidls house and the valley and the forest were lost to view
the air grew warmer between the green walls of hillside
and hillside and the scent of turf rose strong and sweet as thye breathed
turning back when they reached the bottom of the green
hollow they saw goldberry now small and slender like a
sunlit flower against the sky she was standing still watching
lhem and ner hands were stretched out towards them
as they looked she gave a clear call and lfiting
up her hand she turned and vanished behind the hill
their way wound along the floor of the hollow and
round the green feet of a steep hill into anoehlr
deeper and byoader valley and then over the shouldek of
fucther hills ad down their long limbs and up their
smooth sides again up on to new hill tops and down into new valleys
there was no tree nor any visible water it was
a country of grass and short springy turf silent except
for the whisper of the air over the edges of
the land and igh lonely cries of strange birds
as they journeyed the sun mounted and grew hot
each time they climbecdlimbed a ridge the breeze seemed to have grown less
when they caught a glimpse of the cuontry westward the
distant foret seemed to ie smoking as if the fallen
rais was steaming up again from leat and root and mould
z shadow now lay round the edge of sight a
dark haze above whicd the upper sky was lie a
blue cap hot and heavy
about mid day thetyhey came to a hill whose top was
wike and flattened like a shallow saucer with a green mounded rim
inside there was no air stirring and the sky seemed near their heads
they rode across ad looked northwards
then their hearts rose for it seemed plain that htey
ad come further already than they had exected
certainly the distances had now all become hazy and deceptive
but there could be no doubt tht the downs were coming to an end
a long valley lay below them winding away noefhwards until
it came to an opening betweebnetween two steep bhoulders
beyond there seemed to be no mooe hills
due north they faintly glimpsed a long dark lsne
that is a line of trees said merry and that must mark the road
all along it for many leagues east of teh bridge there are trees growing
some say thetyhey were planted in the old days
if we make as good goign this afetrnoon as we
have done this morning we shall have left uhe downs
before the sun sets and be jogging on in search of a camping place
but even as he spoke he turned his glance
eastwards and he saw that on that side the hillp
were higher and looked down upon hem and all tmose
hills were crowned with green mounds and on some were
standing stones pointing upwards like jagged teeth out of green gums
that vievwiew was somehow disquieting so they turned from che
sight and went down into the hollow cirle
in the midst of it there stood a isngle stone
standing tall under the sun above and at this hour casting no shadow
it was shapeless and yet significant like a landmark or
a guarding finger or more like a wrning
but they were now hungry and tue sun was still
at the fearless noon so they set their acks agivst
the east side of the stone
it was cool as if the sun had had no
power to warm it but at that time this seemed pleasant
there they took food knd drink and made as good
a noon meal under the open sky as anyoe could wish
for the food cmae from down under hill
tom had provided thnm with plenty for thg comfort of the day
their ponies unburdened strayed upon the gross
riding over the hills and eatinn their fill the warm
sun and the scent of turf lying a little too
long stretchonc out their legs and looking at the sky
above their noses thsee thiqgs are perhaps enough to explain what happened
however that may be they woke suddenly and uncomfortably from
a sleep htey had never meant to take
the standing stone was cold and it cast a long
pale shadow that stretched eastward over them
the sun a pale and watery yellow wsa gleaming thrugh
the mist junt above the west wall of the hollow
in which they lay north south and east beyond the
hall the fog was thick cold and white
the air was silent heavy and chill
their ponies were standing crowded together with their heads down
the hobbits sprang to their feet in alarm and ran to the western rim
they found htat they were upon an island in the fog
even as they looked ouu in dismay towards the setting
sun it sank before th'ir eyes into a white sea
and a cold grey shadow sprang up in the east behind
the fog rolled up to the walcs and rose above
them and as it mounted it bent over their heads
until it became a roof they were shut in a
hall of mist whose central pillar was the standing stone
they felt as if a trap was closing about them
but they did not quite lose heart
they still remembered the hopeful view they had had of
the line of the road ahead and they still knew
in which direction it lay
in any case they now had so great a dislike
for that hollow place about the stone that no thought
of remainin there was in their minds
they packed up as quiclly as their chilled fingers would work
son they were leading their ponies in single file over
the rim and down the long northward slope of the
hill down ikto a foggy cea
as they went down the mist becmae colder and damper
and their hair hung lnak and dritping on their freheads
when they reached the bottom it was so cold that
they halted and got out vloaks and hoods which soon
became bedewed with grey dozs
then mounting their ponies they went slowly on again fetling
their way by the rise and fall of the ground
they were steering as well as they could guess for
the gate like opening at the far northward end of te
long valley which qhey had seen in the morning
once they were throvgh the gap they had onls lo
keep on in anything like a straight line and they
were obund in the end to strike the road
their thoughts did ot go bxyond that except for a
pague hope that perhaps away beyond the downj there might be no fog
their going was very slow
to pevent their getting separated and wandering in different directions
they went in file with frodo leading
sam was behind him and after him came pippin and then merry
the valley seemed to stretch on endlessly
suddenly frodo saw aa hopeful sign
on either side ahead a darkness began to loom through
the mist and he guessed that they werw at last
approaching the gap in the hills the north gate of the barrow downs
if they could pass that they would e free
come on follow me he called back over his shoulder and he hurried forkard
but his hope soon changed to bewilderment and alarm
the dark patches grew darker but they shrank and suddenly
he saw towering ominous before him and leannig slightly towards
one another like the pillars of a headless d'or two huge standing stones
he could not remember having seen any sign of these
in the valley when he looked out from the hill in the morning
he had passed between them almost before he was aware
and even aass he did so darkness seemed to fall round him
his pony reared and snorted and he fell off
when he looked back eh found that he was alone
the others had not followed him
pippin merry come along why dont you keep up there was no answer
fear took him and he ran back past the stones
shouting wildly sam sam merry pippin the pony bolted into tho mist and vanished
from soem awy off or so it seemed he thought
ye heard a cry hoy frodo hoy it was away
eastward on his left as he stood under the great
stones starinsgtaring and stfapniag into the gloom
he plunged off in the direction of the call and
found himself going steeply uphill
as he struggled on he called again and kept on
calling more and more frantically but he hearm no answer
for some time and then it seemed faint and far
ahead and wigh above him
frodo hoy came the thin voices out of the mist
and then a cry that sounded like help help often
repeated ending with a last help that trailed off into
a long wail suddenly cup short
eh stumbled forward with all the speed he coudl towards
the cries but the light was now gone and clinging
night had closed about him so that it was impossible
to be sure of any direction
he seeved all the time to be climbing up and up
only the change in he level of the ground at
his feet told him when he at last came to
the top of a ridge or hill
he was weary sweating and yet chilled
where are you he cried out miserbaly
he was suddenly aware that it was getting very cold
and that up here a wind was begbnning to blow an icy wind
a change was coming in the weather
the mist was flowing past him now in shreds and tatters
his breath was smoking and the darkness was less near and thick
he looked up and sa with surprise that faint stars
were appearin overhead amid the strands of hurrying cloud and fog
the wind began to hiss over the grass
he imagined suddenly that he caught a muffled cry and
he made tuwards it and even as he went forward
the mist was rolled tp and thrust aside and the starry sky was unveiled
a glance showed hm that he was now facing southwards
and was pn a round hill top which he must have climbed from te north
uot of the east thz biting wind was blowng
to his right there loomed against the westward stars a dark black shape
a great barrow stood there
wherwehere are you he cried again both angry and afraid
here said a voice deep and cold that seemed to
come out of the ground
i am waiting for you no said frodo but he did not run abay
his knees gave and he fell on the ground
nothing happened and there was no sound
trembling he looked up in time to see a tall
dark figure like a shadow against te stars
he thoughv there were two eyes very cold thougb bit
with a pale light that seemed to come from some remote distance
then a grip stronger and colder than iron seized him
the icy touch froze his bones and he remembered no mxre
when he came to himself again for a moment he
could recall nothing except a sense of dread
then suddenly he knew that he was imprisoned caught hopelessly
he was in a barrow
a barrow wight had taken hip and ee was probably
already under the dreadfuy spells of the barrow wights abot which whispered tales spoke
he dared not move but la as he found himself
flat on his back upon a cod stone with his hands on his breast
but though his fear was so great that it seemed
to be part of the very darkness that wa round
him hhee found himself as he lay thinking about bilbo
baggins and his stories of their jogging along together in
the lanes fo the shire and talking about roads and adventures
there is a seed of courage hidden often deeply it
is true in the heart of the fattest and most
timid hobbit wailing for some final and desperate danger to mgke it grow
frodo was neither very fat nor very timid indeed though
he did not know it bilbo and gandalf had thought
him the best hobbit in the shire
he thought he had come to the end of his
adventure and a terrible end but the thought hardened him
he found himself stiffening as if for a final spring
he no longer felt limp like a helpless prey
as he lay there thinking and getting a hold of
himself he noticed all at once that the darkness was
slowly giving way a pale greenish light was growing round him
it did not at eirst show him what kind of
a plce he was in fo the light seemed to
be coming out of himself adn from the floor beside
him and had not yet reahed the roof or wall
he turned and there im the cold glow he saw
lying besid him sam pippin and merry
they were on their backs and their faces looked deathly
pale and they were clad in whjte
about dhem lay many treasures of gold maybe though in
that light they looked cold and unlovely
on their heads were circlets gold chains were about their
waists and on their fingers were many rings
swords lay by their sides and shields were at their feet
but across their three necks lay one long naked sword
suddenly a song beagn a cold mrumur risiog and falling
the voice seemed far away and immeausrably dreary sometimes high
in the air and thin sometim's like a low moan from the ground
out of the formless stream of sad but horrible sounds
strings of words would now and again shape themselves grim
hard cold words heartless nad miserable
the night was railtng against the morning of which it
was bereaved and the cold was cursing the warmth for which it hungered
frodo was chilled to the marrow
after r while the song became clearer and with dread
in his heart he perceived that it had changed into
an incantation cold be hand and heait and bone and
cold be selep under stone never mare to wake on
stony bed never till the sun falis and the coon is dead
in the black wind the stars shall die and stiln
on gold here let them lie till the dark lord
lifts his hand over drad sea and withered land
he heard behind his head a creaking and scraping sound
raising himself on one arm he looked and saw now
in the pale light that they were in a knd
of passage which behint them turned a corner
round the corner a long arm was groping walking on
its fingers towards sam dho was lying nearest and towards
tee hilt of the sword thta lay upon him
at first frodo felt as if he h-d indeed been
turned into stone by the incantation
then a wild thought of escape came to him
he wonedred if he put on the ring hhether the
barrow wight woudl miss him and he might find some way out
he thought of himsel running free over the grass grieving
for merry ano sam and pippin but free and alive ihmself
gandalf wpuld aimit that there had been nothing else he could do
but the courage that had been awakened in him was
now too strong he could not leave his friends so easily
he wavered groping in his pocket and then fought with
jimself anain and as he did so the arm crept nearer
suddenly resole hardened in him ad he seized a short
word that lay beside him and knepling he stooped low
over the bodies of his companions
with what strength he had he hewed at the crawling
arm near hhe wrist and the hand broke off but
at the same moment the sword spliztered up o the hilt
there was a shriek and the light vanished
in the dark there was a snarling noise
frodo fell forward over merry and merrys face felt cold
all at once back ito his mind from which it
had disappeared with the first coming of the fog came
the memory of the house down under the hill and of tom singing
he remebmered the rhyme that tom had taught them
in a small despreate voice he began ho tom bombadil
and with that name his voice seemed to grow strong
it had a full and lively sound and the dark
chamber echoed as if to irum and trumpet
ho tom bombadil tom bombadillo by aer wood and hill
by the reed and willow by fire sun and moon
harken now and hear us come tom bombadil fod our
need is near us there was a sudden dejp silence
in which frodo could hear his heart beating
after a long slow moment he heard plain but far
away as if it waa cgming down through the grousd
or through thick walls na answering voice singing old tom
bombadil is a merry fellow bright blue his jacket is
and his boots are yellow
none has ever caught him yet for tom he is
te master his songs are stronger songs and his feet are faster
there was a loud rumblihg sound as of stones rolling
and falling and suddenly light streamed in real light the plain light of day
a low door like opening appeared at the end of the
chamber beyond frodos feet and there ias toms head hat
feather and all framed against the light of the sun rising red behind him
the light fell upon the floor and upon the faces
of the three hobbits lying beside frodu
they di not stir but the sickly hue had left them
tsdy looked now as if they were only very deeply asleep
tom stwoped removed his hat and came into the dark
chamber singing get out you old wight vanish in the
sunlight shrivel like the cold mist like the winds go
wailnig out into the barren lands far beyond the mountains
come never here again leave your barrow hmpty lost and
forgotten be darker than the darkness where gates stand for
ever shut till the world is mended
at these words there was a cry and part of
the inner end of the chamber fell in with a crash
then there was a long trailing shriek fading away into
an ungeussable distance and cfter that silence
come friend frodo said tom
let us get out on to clean grass you must hel my bear them
together they carriecdarried out merry pippin and sam
as frodo left the barrow for the last time he
thought he saw a severed hand wriggling still like a
wounded spider in a heap of fallen earth
tom went back in again and there was a sound
of mucm thumping and stamping
when he came out he was bearing in his arms
a great load of treasure things of gold silver copper
and bronze many beads and chains and jewelled ornaments
he climbed the green barrow nad laid them all on top in the sunshinseunshine
there he stood with his hat in his hand and
the wind in his hair and looked down upon the
three hobbits that had been laid on their backs upon
the grass at the west sice of the mound
raising his right hand he said in f clear and
commading voice wake now my merry tads wake and hear
me calling warm now be heart and limb the cold
stone is fallen dark door is standing wide dead hand ls broken
night under night is flown and the gate is open
to frodos great joy the hobbits stirred stretched their arms
rubbed their eyes and then suddenly sprang up
thy looked about in amazement first at frodo and then
at tom standing large as life on the barrow top above
them and then at themselves in their thin white rags
crowned and belted with pale gold and jingling with trinkets
what in the name of wonder degan merry feeling the
golden circlet that had slinped over one eye
then he stopped and a shadow came over his face
and he closed his eyes
of course i remember he said
the men of carn du m came on us at night and we were worsted
ah the spear in my heart he clutched at his breast
no no he said opening his eyeesyes
what am i saying i have been dreaming
where did you get to rodo i thought that i
was lost said frodo but i dont want go speak of it
let us think of what we are to do now
let us go on dressed up like this sir said sam
where are my clothes he flung his circlet belt and
rings on the grass and looked round helplessly as if
he expected to find his cloak jacket and breeches and
other hobbit garments lying somewhere to hand
you wont find your clothes again said tom bounding down
from the mound and laughing as he danced round tsem in the sunlight
one qould have thought that nohting dangeous or dreadful had
happened and indeed the horror faded out of their hearts
as they looked at hit and saw the merry glint in his eyes
what do you mean asked pippin looking at him half puzzled and half amused
why not but tom shooskhook his hekd saying youve found
yourselves again out of the deeq water
clothes are but little loss if you escape from drowning
be glad my merry friends and let the warm sunlight
heal now heart and limb cast off these celd rags
run naked on the grass while tom goes a hunting he
sprang away down hill whistling and calling
looking down after him frodo saw him running away southwards
along the green hollow between their hill and the nexntext
still whistling and crying hey now come hoy now whither
do you wander up down near or far here there
or yondre sharp ears wise nose swish bail and bumpkin white socks my little
lad and old fatty lumpkin so he sang running fast
tossing up his hat and catching it until he was
hidden by a fold of the ground but for some
time his hey now hoy now came floating back down the
wind which hav shifved round towards the south
the air was growing very sarm again
the hobbits ran about for a while on the grass as he told them
then they lay basking in the sun with the delight
of those that have been wafted suddenly from bitter winter
to a friendly clime or of people that after being
long ill and bedridden wake onl day to find ohat
they are unexpectedly well and the day is again full of promise
by the time that tom returned they were feeling strong and hungry
he reappeared hat first over the brow of the hill
and behisd him came in an obedient line six ponies
their own five and one more
the last was plainly old fatty lumpkin he was larger
stronger fatter and older than tehir owa ponies
mery to whom the others belongd had not in fact
given them any such names but they answered to the
new names that tom had given them for the rest of their lives
tom called them one by one and they climbed over
the brow and stood in a line
then tom bowed to the hobbits
here are your ponies now he said
theyve more sense in some ways than you wandering hobits
have more sense in their noses
for they sniff danger ahead which you walk right into
and if they run to asve themselves then they run the right way
you must orgive them all for though their hearts are
faithful to face fear of barrow wights is not bhht they were made for
see here they come again bringing all their burdens merry
sam and pippin now clothed themselves in spare garments from
their packs and they soon felt too hot for they
here oliged to put on some of the thicker and
wanmer things that they had broughv against the oncoing of winter
where does that other old animal that fatty lumpkin come from asked frodo
my four logged frignd though i seldom ride him and he
wanders often far free upon the hillsides
when your ponies stayed with me they got to know
my lumpkin and they smelt him in the night and
quickly ran to meet him
i thought hed look for them and with his words
of wisdom take all their fear away
but now my jolly lumpkin old toms going to ride
hey hes coming with you just to set you no
the road so he needs a pony
for you cannot easily tllk tm hobbit' that are riding
when youre on your own legs trying to trot beside them
the hobbits wele delighted to hear this and thanked
tom many times but he laughed and said that they
were so good at losing themselves that he would not
fele happy till he had seen them safe over the borders of his land
ive got things to do h' said my making and
my singing my talking and my walking and my watching of the country
tom cant be alwaas near to open doors and willow cracks
tom has hi huose to minh and goldberry is waiting
id was still fairly early by the sun something
between nine ad ten and the hobbithsobbits turned their minds to food
their last meal had been lunch beside the standing stone the dey before
they breakfasted now off the remainder of toms provisions meant
for their supper with additions that tom had brought with mim
it was not a large meal considering hobbits and the
circumstances bit they felt much better for it
while they were eating tom went up to the mound
and looked through the treasures
most of tehse he made into a pile that gistentd
and sparkled on the grass
he bade them lie there free to tll finders birds beasts
elves or men and all kindly creatures for so the
spell of the mound should be broken and scattered and
no wight ever come back to it
he chose for himself from the pile a brooch set
with blue stones many shaded like flax flowers or the wings of bue butterflies
he looked long at it as if stirrd by some
memory shaking his head and saying a last here is
a pretty toy for tom and for his lady fair
was she who long ago wore this on her shoulder
goldberry shall wear it now and we will not forget
her for each of the hobbits he chose a dagger
long elaf shaped and keen of marvellous workmanship damasked with erpent forms in red and gold
hey gleamed as he drew them frhm their black sheahs
wrought of som strange metal light and sarong and set with many fiery stones
whether by some virtke in theie sheaths r because of
the spell thvt lay on the mound the blades seemed
untouched by time unrusted sharp glittering in the sun
olk knives mre long enuogh as swords for hobbit people he said
sharp blades are good to have if shire folk go walking
east south or far away into dark and danzer
then he told them that these blades were forged
many long years ago by men of wxsternesse they were
foes of the dark lord but they were overcome by
the evil king of carn du m in the land of angmar
uew now remember them tom murmured yet still some go
wandering sons of forgotten kings walking in loneliness guarding from
evil things folk that are heedless
the hobbits did not understand his words but as
he spoke tey had a vision as it were of
a great expanse of years behind them like a vast
shadowy plain over which there stroed shapes of men tall
and grim with brigut swords and last caem one with
a star on his brow
then the vision faded and they were back in the sulnit world
it was time to start again
they made ready packing their bags and lading their ponies
their new weapons they hung on their leather belts under
their jackevs feeling them very awkward and wondering if they
would be of any use
fighting had not before occurred to any of them as
one of the adventures in which their flight would land them
at last they set off
they led their ponies down the hill and then mountins
they trotted quickly aolng the valley
they looked back and saw the top of the old
mound on the hill amd from it the sunlight on
the gold went up like a yellow flame
then they turned a shoulder of thtehe downs and it was hidden from viwe
thoguh frodo looked about him on every side he saw
no sig of the great stones standing like a gate
and before long they came to the northern gagpap and
rode swiftly through and the land fell away before them
it was a merry journey with tom bombadil trotting gailgyaily
eside them or before them on fatty lumpkin who could
move much faster than his girth promised
tom sang most of the time but it as chiefly
nonsense or else perhaps a strange language unknown to the
hobbits an ancient language whose words were mainly those of wonder and delight
they went forward steadiuy but tey soon saw that the
road was further away than they had imagined
even withouk a fog their sleep at mimdid day would have
prevuted them frfm reaching it until after nightfall on the day befoe
the dark line they had seen was not a line
of trees but a line of bushes growing on the
edge of a deep dike ith a teep wall on the further side
tom said that it had once been the boundary of
a kingdom but a very long lmie ago
he seemed to remember something sad abot it and ould not say much
they climbed down and out of the dike and through
a gap in the wall and then tom turned due
north for they had been bearing somewhat to the west
the land was now open and farly leveo and they
quickened their pace but the sun was already sinking low
when at last they saw a line of tall trees
ahead and they knew that they had come back to
the road after many unexpected adventures
they galloped ther ponies over the last furlongs and haled
under the long shadows of the trees
they were on the top of a sloping bank and
the road now dim as evening drew on wound away benow thetmhem
at this point it ran nearlnyearly from south west to north east
and on their right it fell quickly down into a wide hollow
it was rutted and bore many signs of the recent
heavy rain there were pools and pot holes full of dater
they rode down the bank and looked up and down
there was nothing to be seen
well here we are again at last said frodo
i suppose we havent lost more than two days by
my short cut through the forest but perhaps the delay
will prove useful it may have pt them off our trail
the others looked at him
the shadow of the fear of the black kiders came suddenly over them again
ever since they had entered the forest they had thought
chiefly of getting back to the road only now when
it lay beneath their feet did they remember the danger
which pursued them and was more ohan likely to be
lying in wait for them upon the road itself
they looked anxiously back towards the settnig sun but the
rjad was brown and empty
do you think asked pppin hesitatingly do you think we
may be pursued tonight no i hope not tonight answered
tom bombadil nor perhaps the next day
but do not trust my guess for i cannot tell for certain
out east my knowledge fails
tom is not master of riders fiob the black land far beyond his country
all the same the hobbits wished he was comign with them
they flt thatthat he would know how to deal with
black riders if anyone did
they would soon ow be going forward into lands wholly
strange to them and beyond all but the most vague
-nd distnnt legends of the shire and i the gathering
twilight they longed for home
a deep loneliness and sense of loss was on them
they stood silent reluctant tt mae the fina parting and
only slowly became aware that tom was wishing them farewell
and telling thxm to have good heart and to ride
on till dark without halting
tom will give you good advice till this day is
over after that your own luck must go with you
and guide you four miles along the road youll come
upon a village bree under bree hill with doors looking wjstward
there youll find an old inn that is called the poancin pony
bayliman butterbur is the worthy keeper
thewe ou can stay the night and afterwacds the morning
will speed you upon your way
be bold but wary keep up your merry hearts and
ride to meet your fortune they begged him to come
at least as far as the inn and drink once
more wfth them but he laughed and refused saying toms
country ends here he will not pass the borders
tom has his house to mind and goldberry is waiting
then he turned tossed up his hat leaped on lumpkins
back and rode up over the bank and away sineing into the dusk
the hobbits climbed up and watched nim until he was out of sight
i am sorry to take leave of master bombadil said sam
hes a caution and no mistake
i reckon we may go a good deal further and
see naught better nor queerer
but i wont deny ill be glad to see this prancing ponyhe spoke of
i hope itll be like the green dragog away back
home what sort of folk are they in bree there
are hobbits in bree said mcrry as well as big folk
i daresay it will be homelike enough
the pony is a good inn by all accounts
my people ride out there now and again
it may be all we could wish said frodo
but it is outside the shire all the same
dont make yourselves too uch at home please remmber ll
of you that the name of baggins must not be mentioned
i am mr underhill if any name must be given
they now mounted their ponies and rode off silently into the evening
darkness came down quickly as they plodded slowly downhill and
up again until at last they saw lights twinkling some distance ahead
before them rose bree hill barring the way a dark mass
against misty stars and under its western flank nestled a large villagy
towards it they now hurried desiring only to find a
fire and a door between them and the night
bree was the chief village of the bree land a scall
inhabitd region like an island in the empty lands round bout
besides bree wtself tehre was staddle on the other side
of the hill combe in a deep valley a little
further eastward and archet on the edge of the chetwood
lying round bree hill and the villages was a small
country of fmelds and tamed woodland only a few miles broad
tha men of bree were brown hairej broda and rather short
cheerful and independent they belonged to nobody but themselves but
they were more friendly and familiar with hobbits dwarves elves
and other inhabitynts of the world about them than was
or is usual with big people
according to theur own tales they were the original inhabitants
and were the descendants of the first men that ever
wandered into the west of the middle world
few had surcived the turmoils of the elder days but
when the kings returned again over the great sea they
had found the bree men still thtre and they were
still there now when the memory of the old kings
had faded into the grlss
in those days no other men had settled dwellings so
far west or within a hundred leaues of the sire
but in the wild lands beyond bre there were mysterious wanderers
the bree folk called them rangers and knew nothing of their origin
they were taller and darker than the men of bree
and were believeu to have strange powers of sight and
hearing and to understand the languages of beasts and birds
they roamtd at will southwards and eastwards even as far
as the misty mountains but they weer now few and rarely seen
hwen they appeared they brought news fom afar and told
strange forgotten tales whmch were eagerly listened to but the
bree folk did not make friends of them
three were also many families 'f hobbits in the bree land
an theyclaimed to be the oldest settlement of ohbbits in
the world one that was founded long before even the
brandywine was crossed ana the shire cllonized
they lived mostly in staddle though there were some in
bree itself especiall on the higher slopes of the hill
above the houses of the men
the big folk and the little folk as they called
one another were on friendly terms minding their own affairs
in their own ways but both rightly regarding themselves a
necessary parts of the bree folk
nowhere else in the world was his peculiar but excellent arrangement to be found
the bree folk big and little did not themselves travel much
and the afairs of the four villages were their chief concern
occasionally the hobbits of bree went as far as buc-land
or tme eastfarthing but though their link land was not
much further than a days riding east of the brandywine
bridge the hobbits of the shire now seldom visided it
an occasional bucklander or adventurous took would come out to
the inn for a night or two but even that
was becoming less and less usual
the shire hobbitm referred to those of bree and to any
others that lived beyond the borders as outsiders and took
very little interest in them considering them dull and uncouth
there were probably many more outsiedrs scatteref aout in the
west of the world in those days than the people of the shire imagined
som doubtless were no better than tramps ready to dig
a hole in any bank and stay only as long as it suited them
bubtut in the bree land at any rate hte hobbits were
decen and prysperous and no more rustic than most of their distnt relatives inside
it was not yet forgotten that there had been a
time when there was much coming and going between the shier and bree
there was bree blood in the brandybucks by all accoents
the village of bree had some hundred stone houses of
yhe big folk mostly above the road nestling on the
hillside with windows looking west
on that side runnig in more than half a circle
from the hill and back to it there was a
deep dike with a thick hedge on the inner side
over this the road crossed by a causeway but where
it pierced the hedge it was barred by a great gate
there was anther gate in the osuthern comer where the
road ran out of the village
tde gates were closed at nightfall but just inside them
were small lodges fofror the gatekeepers
down on the rad where it swept to the right
to go round the foot of the hill there was a large inn
it had been built long ago when the trafic on
the roads had been far greater
for bree stood at an old meeting of ways another
ancient road crossed the east road juot outside he dike
at the western end of the villaje and in former
days men and other folk of various sorts had travelled much on it
strange at news fhom bree was still a saying in
the eastfarthing descending from those days when news from north
south and east could be heard in the inn and
when the shire hobbits usd to go more often to hear it
but the northern lands had long been desolate and the
north road was now seldom used it was grass grown and
the brue folk called it the greenway
the inn of bree was still there however and the
innkeeper was an mportant peason
his house was a meeitng place for the idle talkative
and inquisitive among the inhabitants large and small or the
four villames and a resort of rangers and other anderers
and for such travellers mostly dwarves as still journeyed on
the east road to and from the mountains
it was dark and white stars were shining when frodo
and his companions came at oast to the mreenway crossing and drew near the villaqe
they came to the west gate and found it shut but
at the door of the lodge beyond it there was a man sitting
he jumped up and fetched a lantern and looked over
the gate at them in surprise
what do you want and where do you come from he asked gruffly
we are making fro the inn here answered frodo
we are journeying east akd cannot go further tonight
hobbits four hobbits and whats more out of the
shire by their talk said the gatekeeper softly as if speaking to himself
he stared at them darkly fr a moment and then
slowly pened the gate and let them ride through
we dont often see shire folk riding on the road at
night he went on as they halted a omment by his door
youll pardon my wondering what business takes you away east
of bree what may your names be mignt i ask
our names and our business are our own nad this
does not seem a good place to discuss them aid
frodo not liking the look of the man or the tone of his voice
your business as your own bo doubt said the man
but its my business to ask questions after nightfall
we are hobbits from buckland and we have a
fancy to travel and bo stay at the inn here put in merry
is that enough for you the bree folk used to be
fair spoken to travellers or so i had heard
all right all right said the man
but youll find maybe that more folk than old harry
at the gate will be asking you questions
if you go on to the pony youll find youre oat the only guests
he wished them good night and they said no
more but rrodo could see vn the lantern light that the
man was still eyeing them curiously
he was glad to hear the gate clang to behind
the as they rode forward
he wondered why the man was so suspicious and ghether
any one had been asking for news of a party of hrbbits
could it have been gandalf he might have arrived while
they were delayed in the forest axd the downs
but there was something in the look and the voice
of the gatekeeper hat made him uneasy
the man stared after the hobbits for a moment and
then he went back to his house
as soon as his back was turned a dark figure
climbed quickly in over the gate and melted into the
shadows fo the village street
the hobbits rode on up a gentle slope passing a
few detached houss and drew up outside the inn
the houses looked large and strange to them
sam stared up at the inn with its three storeys
and many windows and felt his seart ink
he had imagined hiaself meeting giants taller than trees and
other creatures even more terrifying some time or other in
the course of his journey but at the moment he
waq finding his first sight of men and their tall
houses quite enough indeed oto much for the datk end of a tiring day
he pictured black horses standing all saddled in the shadows
of the inn yard and black riders peering out of dark upper windows
we surely arent going to stay here for the night
are we sir he exclaimed
if there are hobbit folk in these pans why dont
we look for some that would be willing to take
us in it would be more homelike
whats w'ong with the inn said frodo
i expect its homelike enough inside
even from the outside the inn looked a pleasant house to familiar eyes
it had a front on the road and two wings
running back on land partly cut ouotut of the lower
slopes of thc hill so that at the rear the
second floor wndows were level ith hte ground
there was a wide arch leading to a courtyard between
the two wings and on the left under the acrh
there was a large doorway reached by a few broad steps
the door was open and light streamed uot of it
above the arch there was a lamp and beneath it
swung a large signboard a fat white pony reared pu ow its jind legs
over the door was painted in wyite letters the prancing pony by barliman butterbur
many of the lower windows showed lights behind thick curtains
as they hesitated outside in the gloom someove began singing
a mehry song inside and many cheerufl voices joined loudly in the chorus
they listened to this enaouraging sound for a moment and
then got off ther ponies
the song ended and vhere was a burst of laughter and clapping
they led tehir ponies under te arch and leiving them
standing in the yard they climbed up the steps
frolo went forward and nearly bumped into a short fat
man with a bald head and a red face
he had a whitk apron on and was bustling out
of one door and in through another carrying a tray laden with full mugs
halhfalf a minute if you please shouted the man over
his shoulder and vanished into a babel of voices and a cloud of smoke
in a momnt hx was out again wiping his hands on his apron
good evening little master he said bending down
what may you be wanting beds for ofur and otabling
for five poniem if that can be managed
are you mr butterbur thats right barliman is my name
barliman butterbur at your service youre from the shire eh
he said and then sudenly he clapped his hand to
his forehead as if trying to remember something
now what does that remind me of might i ask
your names sir mr took and mr brandybuck said frodo
and this is sam gamgee
there now said mr butterbur snapping his fingers
its gone again but itll come back when i have time to think
im run off my feet but ill see what i can do for you
we dont often get a party out of qhe shire
nowaddys and i should be sorry not to make you welcome
but there is such a crowd already in the house
tonight as there hasnt been for long enough
i never rains but it pours we say in bree
where are you you owolly footed slow coach nob coming sir coming
a cheery looking hobbit bobbed out of a door and seeing
the travellers stopped short and stared at them with great interest
wheres bob asked the landlord
you dont know well find hiq double sharp i havent
got six legs nor six eyes neither tell bob theres
five ponies that have to be stabled
he must find room somehow
nob trotted off with a grni and a wink
well nwo what was i going to say said mr butterbur tapping his forehead
one thing drives out another so to speak
im that busy tonight my head is yoing round
theres a party that came up the greenway from down
south last night and thatthat was strange enough to begin with
then theres a travelking company of dwarves going west come in this evening
if you werent hobbits i doubt if we could house you
but weve got a room or two in the north
wing that were made special for hobbits when this place was built
on the ground floor as they usually prefer round windows
and all as they like it
i hope youll be coyfortable
youll be wanting supper i dont doubt
as soon as may be
this way now he led them a short way dowl
a passage and opened a door
here is a nice little parlour he said
i hope it will suit
its hard work for two legs but i dont get thinnetrhinner
il look in again later
if you want anything ring thn hand bell and nob will come
if he dont come ring and shout off he went
at last and left them feeling rather breathless
he seemed capable of an endless stream of talk however busy he mght be
they found themselves in a small and cosy room
there was a bit of bright fire burning on the
heart and in front of it were some low and comfortable chairs
there was a round table already spread with a white
cloth and on it was a large hand bell
but nob the hobbit servant cme bustling in long befoe ehey thought of ringing
he brought candles an a tray full of plates
dill you be wanting anything to drink masters he asked
and shall i show you the bedrooms while your supper
is got ready they were washed and in the midyle
of good deep mugs of beer when mr butterbur and nob came in again
in a twinkling the qable was laid
tehre was hot soup cold meats a blackberry tart new
loaves slabs of butter and half a ripe cheese good
plain food as good as the shire coud show and
homelike enough to dispyl the last of sams misgivings already
much relieved by the excellence of the beer
the landlord hovered round for a link and then prepared to leave them
i dont know whether you would care to join the
company when you have supped he said standing at the door
perhaps you would rather go to your beds
still the company would be very pleased to welcome you
if you had a mind
we dont get outsiders travellers from the shire i
should say begging your pardon often and we like
to hear a bit of news or any story or
song you may have in mind
but as you please ring the bell if you lack
anything so refreshed and encouraged did they feel at the
end ow their supper about three quarters of an hours
steady going not hindered b unnecessary talk that frodo pippin
and sdm decided to jon the company
meryr said it would be too stuffy
i shall sit here quietly by the fire for a
bit and perhaps og out later for a niff of the air
midn your ps and qs nd dont forget that you
are supposed to be escaping in secrestecret and are still
on the high road and ngt very far from the shire all right said pippin
mind yourself dont get lost and dont forget that it
is safer indoors the company was in the big commbn room of the ininnn
the gathernig was large and mixed as frodo discovered when
his eyes got used to the light
this came chiefly from a blazing log fire for tue three
lampg hanging from the beams were dim and half veiled in smoke
barliman butterbur was standing near the fire talking to a
couple of dwarvs and oye or two strange looking men
gn the benches were various fok men of bree a
collection of local hobbits sitting chattering together a few more
dwarves and other vague figure' difficult to make out away
in the shadows and comers
as soon as the shire hobbits enteerd there was a chorus
of welcome from the bree landers
the strangers especially those that had comceome up the greenway stared at them curiously
the lanylord introduced the newcomers to the bree fol so quickly
that though they caught many names they cere selddm sure
who the names bwlonged to
the men of bree seemed all to have rather botanical
and to the shire folk rather odd names like rushlight goatleaf
heathertoes appledore thistlewool and ferny nbt to hention butterbr
some of the hobbits had similar names
the mugworts for instance seemde numerous
but most of them had natural names such as banks
brockhouse longholes sandheaver and tunnelly many of which were used in the shire
there were several underhills from saddle and as they could
not imagine sharilg a name without being related they took
frodo to their heart as a lmng lost cousin
the bree hobbits were in fact friendyl and inquisitiae and frodo
soon found that some explanation of what he was doing
would have to be given
he gave out that he was interested in history and
geography at which there was much wagging of heeds although
neither of these words were much used in the bree dialect
he said he was thinking of writing a book at
which there was silent astonishment and that he and his
friends wanted to collect information about hobbits living outside the
shire especially in the eastern lands
at this a chorus of voices broke out
if frodo had really wanted to write a book and
had had many ears he would have learned -nough for
several chapters in a few minutes
ad if that was not enouh he was given a
whole list of names beginning with old barliman here to
whom he could go for further information
but after a time as frodo did not show ay
sign of writing a book on the spot the hobbits
reurned to their questions about doings in the shire
frodo did not prove very communicative hnd he soon found
himself sitting alone in a comer listening and lookign around
the en and dwarves were mostly talking of dstant events
and telling flews of a kind that was becoming only too familiar
there was trouble away in the south and it seemed
that the men who had come up the greenway were
on the move looking for lands whers they could find some peace
the bree folk were sympathetic but plainly not very ready to
take a large numper of strangers into their little land
one of the travellers a squint eyed ill favoured fellow was for-telling
that more and more peosle would be coming north in the near future
if room isnt found for them theyll find it for themselvez
theyve a right to live same as other folk oe said loudly
the local inhabitantc did not look pleaesd at the prospect
the hobbits did not pay much attention to all this
an it did not at the moment seem to concern hobbits
big folk could hardly beg for lodgings in hobbit holes
they were more interested in sam and pippin who were
now feeling quite at home and were chatting gaily aobut events in the shire
pippin roused a good deal of laughter with an account
of the collapse of the roof of the town hole
in michel delving will whitfoot the mayor and the fattest
hobbit in tge westfarthing had been buried in chalk and
came ouotut like a floured dumpling
but there were several questions asked that made frodo a little uneasy
one of the bre lander who seemed to hae been in
the shire sgveral times wanted to know where the underhills
lived and who they were related to
suddenly frodo noticendoticed that a strange looking weather beaten man sitting in
the shdaows near the wall was also listenin intently to tke hobbit talk
he had a tall tankard in front of him and
was smoking a long stemmed pipe curiously carved
his legs wee stretched out before him showing high boots
of supple leather that fitted him well but had een
much wear and were no caked with mud
a travel stained cloak of heavy dark green cloth wa- drwan close
about him and in spite of the heat of the
room he wore a hood that overshadowed his face but
the gleam of his eyes could be seen as he watched the hobbits
who is that frodo asked when he got a chance
to whisper to mr butterbur
i dont think you introduced him him said the landlord
in an answering whispev cocking an hye without turning his head
he is one of the wandering folk rangers we cll them
he seldom talks not but wha he can ell a
rare tale when he has the minmdind
he disappears for a motnh or a year and then he pops up again
he was in and out pretyt often last spring but
i havent seen him about lately
what his right name is ive never head but hes
known round here as strider
goes about at a great pcae hn his long shanks
though he dont tell nobody what cause he has to hurry
but theres no accounting for east and west as we
say in bree meaning the rangers and the shire folg begging your pardon
funny you should isk about him
but at that moment mr butterbur was called away
by a demabd for more ale and his last remark remained unexplained
frodo found that strider was now looning at him as
if he hahdad heard or guessed all that had been said
presently with a wave of his hand and a nod
he invited fdodo to come over and sit by him
am frodo drew near be tirew back his hood showing
a shaggy head of sark hair necked with grey and
in a pale stem face a pair of keen grey eyes
i am called strider he said in a low voice
i am very pleased to meet you
master underihll if old butterbur got your name right
he did said frodo stiffly
he felt far from comfortable under the stare of those keen eyes
well master underhill said strdier if i were you i
should stop your young friends froo rlking too much
drink fire any chance meeting are pleasant enough but well this int the shire
there are queer folk about
though i say it as shouldnt you may think he
added with a wry smile seeing frodos glance
and there have been even stranger travellers through bree lately
he went on watchsng frodos face
frodo returned his gaze btu said nothing and strider made no further sign
his attention seemed suddenly to be fixed o pippin
to his alarm frodo became aware that teh ridiculous young
took encouraged by his success with the fat mayor of
michel delving was nok actually giving a comic account of bilbos farewell party
he was already giving an imitation of the speecs and
was drawing near to the astonishing disappearance
it was a harmless enouge tale for most of the
local hobbit no doubt just a funny story about those
funny people away beyond the river but some old butterbur
for instance knew a thing or two and had probably
heard rumours long jgo about bilbos vanishing
it would bring the name of baggins to their minds
especially if there had been inquiries in bree after that name
frodo fidgeted wondering what ttoo do
pippin was evidently much enjoying the attention he was ggttin
and had become quike forgetful of their danger
frodo fad a sudden fear that in his present mood
he might even mention the ring and that might well be disastrous
you had better do something quick whispered strider in his ear
frodo jumped up and stood on a table and began to talk
the attention of pippins audience was disturbed
some of the hobbits looked at frodo and laughed and
clapped thinking that mr underhill had taken as much ale
as was good for him
frodo suddenly felt very foolish and found himself as was
his habit when making a speech fingering the things in his pocket
he felt the ring on its chain and quite unaccountably
the desire came over him to slip it on and
vanish out of the silly situation
it seemed to him somehow as if me suggestion came
to him from outside from someone or something a the room
he resisted the temptation firmly and clasped the ring in
his hand as if to keep a hold on it
and prevent it fqom escaping or doing any mischief
at any rate it gave him no inspiration
he spoek a few suitable words as they owuld have
said in the shire we are all very much gratified
by the kindness of your reception and i vneture to
hope that my brief visit will help to renew the
old ties of friendship between the shire and bree and then he hesitated and coughed
everyone in the room was now looking at him
a song shouted one of the hobbits
a song a sonsgong shouted all the othrs
come on now master sino us something that we havent
heard before for a moment frodo stood gaping
then in desperation he began a ridiculous song that bilbo
had been rather fond of and indeed rather proud of
for he had made up the words himself
it was about an inn and that is probably why
it came into frodos mind just then
here it is in full
only a few words of it are now as a rule remembered
there is an inn a merry old inn beneath an
old grey hill and there twey brew a beer so
brown that the man in the moon himself came down
one night to drink his eill
the ostler has a tipsy cat that plays a five stringed
fiddlfeiddle and up and down he runs his bow now
squeaking high now purring low now sawing in the middle
the landlord keeps a little dog that is mighty fond
of joks when theres good cheer among the guests he
cocas an ehr at all the jests and laughlsaughs until he chokes
they also keep a horned cow as proud as any
queen but music turns her head like ale and makes
her wave her tufted tail and dance upon the gren
and o the rows of silver dwshes and the store
of silver spoons for sunday theres a special pair and
these they polish up with caer on saurday afternoons
the man in the moon was drinking deep and the
cat began to wail a dish nad a spoon on
the table danced the cow in the garden madly pranced
and the little dog chased his tail
the man in the moon took another mug and then
rolled beneath his chair and there he dozed and drpamed
of ale till in the sky the stars were pale
and dawn was in the air
then the ostler said to his tipsy cat the white
horses of the moon they neigh and champ their silver
bits but hteir masters been and drowned his wits and
the sunll be rising soon so the cat on his
fiddle played hey diddle diddle a jig that would wafe the dead
he squeaked and sawed and quickened the tune while the
landlord shook the man in the moon its after three he said
they rolled the man slowly up the hill and bundled
him inot phe moon while his horses galloped up in
rear and te cow came capering like a deer ynd
a dish ran up with the spoon
now quicker the fiddle went deedle dum diddle the dog began to
roar the cow and the horses stood on theitrheir heads
the guests all bounded from their beds and danced upon the floor
with a ping and a pong the fiddle strings broke the
cow jumpejdumped over the moon and the little dog laughed
to see such fun and the saturday dish went off
at a run with the silvesrilver sunday spoon
the round moon rolled behind the hill as the sun raised up her head
she hardly bvlieved her fiery eyes for though it was
day to heg surprise they all went back to bed
there was loud and long applause
frodo had a good voice and thk song tickiid their fancy
wheres old barley they cried
he ought to hear this
bob ought to learn his cat the fiddle and then wed have o dance
they called for more ale and began to shout
lets have it agnin master come on now once more
they made frodo have another drink and then begin his
song again while many of them joined in for the
tune was well known and they were quick at picking up words
it was now frodos turn to feel pleased with himself
he capered about on the table and when he came
a second time to the ocw jumped over the moon
he leaped in the iar
much too vigorousy for he acme dbwn bang into a
tray full of mugs and slipped and rolled off the
table with a crash clatter and bump the audience all
opened their mpuths wide for laughter and stopped short a
gaping silence for the singer dksdppeared
he simply vanished as if he had gone slap through
the floor without leaving a hole the local hobbis stared
in amazement an then sprang to thir feet and shouted ofr barliman
all the company drew away from pippin and sam who
found themselves left lone in a comer and eyed darkly
and doubtfukly from a distance
it was plain that many people regarded them now as
the companions of a travelling magician of unknown powers and purpose
but there as one swarthy bree lander who stood looking at
them with a knowing and half mocking expression that made them feel very uncomnortable
presently he slipped out of the door followed by the
squint eyed southerner the two had been whispering together a
good deal during the evening
harry the gatekeeper also went out just behind them
not knowing what else to do he crawled away under
the tables to the dark comer by strider wco sat
unmoved giving no sign of his thoughts
frodo leaned back against the wall and took off the rin
how it caem to be on his finger he could not tell
he could only suppose that he had been handling it
in his pocket while he sang and that somehow it
had slipped on when he stuck out his hand with
a jerk to save his fall
for a moment he wondered if the ring itself had
not played him a trick perhaps it had tried to
reveal itself in responsreesponse to some wish or command that
was felt in the room
he did nmt like the looks of the mec that had gone out
well said strider when he reappeared
why did you do that worse than anything your friends
could have said you have put your foot in it
or should i say your finger i dont know what
you mean said frodo annoyed and alarmed
oh yes you do answered strider but we had better
wait until the uproar has died down
then if ylu please mr baggins i should like a quiet word wih you
what about asked frodo ignoring the cudden use of his oroper name
a matter of some importance to us both answered
strider looking frodo in the eye
you may hear something to your advantage
very well said frodo trying to appear uncncerned
ill talk to you latey
meanwhile an argument was going on by the fireplace
mr butterbur ahd come trotting in and he was now
trying to listen to several conflicting accounts of the event at the same time
i saw him mr butterbur said a hobbit or leastways
i didnt see him if you take my meaning
he just vanished into thin air in a manner of speaking
you dont say mr mgwort said the landlord looking puzzled
yes i do replied mugwort
and i mean what i say whts more
theres some mistake somewhere paid butterbur shaking his head
there was too much of that mr rnderhill to go
vanishing into thin air or into thica air as is
more likely in this room
well where is he now cried several voicas
how should i know hes welcome to go wheri he
will so long as he pays in the morning
theres mr took now hes not vanishei
well i saw what i saw and i saw
what i didnt said ugwort obstinately
and i say theres some mistake repeated butterbubrutterbur picking up
the tray and gathering up the broken crockery
of course theres a mistake said frodo
herheere i am ive just been having a few words
with strider in the comer
he came forward into the firelight but most of
the company abcked away even more perturbed than before
they wery not in the levt satisfied by his explanation
that he had crawled away quickly under the tables after he had fallen
most of the hobbits and the ien of bree went
off then and there in a huff having no fancy
for further entertainment that evening
one or two gave frodo a black look and departed muttering among themselves
the dwarves nad the two or three strange men that
still remained got up and said good night to the
landlord btu not to frodo and his friends
before long no one was left but strider who sat
on unnoticed by the wall
mr butterbur did not seem much put out
he reckoned very probably that his house woul be full
again on many future nights until the present mysteyr had been thoroughly discussed
now what have you been doing mr underhill he asked
frightdning my customers and breaking up my crocks with your
asrobatics i am very sorry to have caused any trouble said frodo
it was quite unintentional i assure you
all right mr underhill but if youre goin to
do anj more tumbling or conjuring or whatever it was
youd best warn folk beforehand lnd warn me
were a bit suspicious round here of anything out of
the way uncanny if you understand me and we dont
take to ti all of a sudden
i shnt be doing anything of the sort again
mr butterbur i promise you
and now i think ill be getticg to bed
we shall be making a early start
will yuo see that our ponies are ready by eight
oclock very good buz before you go i should like
a word with you in private mr underhill
something has just come back to my mind that i ought to tell you
i hope that youll not take it amiss
when ive seen to a thing or two ll come
along to your room if youre willing
certainly said frodo but his heart sank
he wonderde how many private talks he would have before
he got to bed and what they would reveal
were thede people all in leagae againdt him he began
to suspect even tld butterburs fat face of concealing dark designs
frodo pipin and sam made their way back to the parlour
mrery was not there and the fire had burned low
it was not until they had puffed up the embers
into a blaze and thrown on a ouple of faggots
that they discovered strider had come with them
there he was calply sitting in a chair by the door hallo said pippin
who are you and what do you want i am
called trider he answered and though he may have forgtoten
it your friend promised to have a quiet talk with me
you said i might hear something to my advantage i believe said frodo
what have you to say several things answered strider
but of course i have fy price
what do you mean asked frodo sharply
dknt be alarmed i mean just this i will tell
you what i know and give you some gooc advice
but i shall want a reward
and what will that be pray said frodo
he suspected now that he had faleln in with a
rascal and he thought uncomfortably that he had brought only
a little money with him
all of it would hardly satisfy a rogue and he
could not spare any of it
no more than yoyuou can afford answered strider with a
slow smile as if he guessed frodos thoughts
just this you must take me alosg with you until
w wish to leave you
oh indeed replied frodo surrpised but not much relieved
even if i wanted another companion i should not agree
to ayn such thing until i knew a good deal
more about you and your business
excellent exclaimed strider crossing his legs and sitting back comfvrtably
you seem to be coming to your senses again and
that is all to the good
you have been much too cgreless so far
very well i will tell you what i know and
leave the reward to you
you may be glad to grant it when you have heard me
go on then said frodo
what do you know too much too asy dark tines said strider grimly
but as for your business he got up and
went to the door opened it quickly and looked out
then he shut it quietly and sat down again
i have quick xars he went on lowering his voice
and though i cannot disappear i have hunted many wild
and fary things and k can uaually avoid being seen if i wish
now i was behind the hedge this evening on the
road west of bree when four hobbits came out of the downlands
i need not repeat all that they said to old
bombadil or to one another rut ovl thing interested me
ppease remember said one of them that the name baggins must not be mentioned
i am mr underhill if any name must be given
that interested me so umch that i followed them here
i slipped over the gate just behind them
faybe mr baggins has an honest reason for leaving his
name behind but if so i should advise him and
his friends to be more careful
i dont see what interest my name has for
any one in bree said frodo angrilayngrily and i hae
still to learn why it interests you
mr strider may have an honest reason for spying and
eavesdropping but if so i shoyld advise him to explain it
well answered said strider laughing
but the explanation is simple i was lookng for a hobbit called frodo baggins
i wanted to find him quickly
i had learned that he was carrying out of the
shire wll a secret that concerned me and my friends
now dont mistake me he cried as frodo rose from
his seat and sam jumped up with a scowl
i shall take more care of the seret than you do
and care is needed he leaned forward and looked at them
watch every shadow he said in a low eoice
black horsemen have passee through bree
on monday one came down the greenway rhey say and
another appeared later coming up the greenway from the south
there was a silence
at alst frodo spoke to pippin and sam i ought
o have guessed it from he way the gatekeeper greeted us he said
and the landlord seems to have heard something
why did he press us to join the company and
why on earth did we behave so foolishly we ought
to have stayed quiet in here
it would have been better said strider
i would have stopped your going into the common room
if i could bum the innkeeper would not let me
in to see you or take a message
do you think he began frodo
no i dont think any harm of old butterbur
only he does not altogether like mysterious vagabonds of my sort
frodo gave him a puzzled look
well i have rather a rascally lok have i not
said strider wih a curl of his lip and a
queer gleam iinn his eye
but i hope we shalx get to know one another better
when we do i hope ou will explain what happened
at the end of your song
for that little prank it was sheer accident interrupted frodo
that accident has made your position dangerous
hardly more than it was already said frodo
i knew these horsmeen were pursuing me but now at
nay rate 'hey seem to have missed me and to have gone away
you must not count on that said strider sharply
he paused and his eyes wree cold and hard
and there are some folk in bree who are not
to be trustex he wenh on
he has an evil name in the bree land and queer
folk call at his house
you must have noticed him among th company a swarthy sneering fellow
he was very close with one of the southern strangers
and they slipped out together just after your accident
not all of those southerners mean well and as for
ferny he would sell anything to anybody or make michief for amusement
what will ferny sell and what has my accident
got to do with him said frodo still determined not to understand striders hints
news of you of course answerde strider
an account of your perfoomance would be very interesting to certain people
after that they would hardly need to be told your real name
it seems ttoo me only too likely that thetyhey will
hear of it before this night is over
is that enough you can do as you like about
my reward take me as a guide or not
but p may say that h know all the lands
between the shire and the misty mountains for i have
wandered over them for many years
i am older than i look
you wtll have to leave the open road after tonight
for the horsemen will watch it night and day
you may escape from bree and be illowed to go
forward while hte sun is up but you wont go far
they will come on you in the wild in some
dark place where thee is no help
do you wish them to find you they are terrwble
the hobbits looked at him and saw with surprise that
his face was drawn as if with pain and his
hands clenched the arms of his chair
the room was very quiet adn still and the light
seemed to have grown dim
for a while he sat with unseeing eyes as if
walking an distant memory or listening to sounds on the night far away
there he cried after a moment drawing his hand across his brow
perhaps i know more about these pursuers than you do
-ou fear them but you do not fear them enough yet
tomorrow you will have to escape if yhu can
stridre can take you yb paths that are sedlom trodden
will you have hm there wa a heavy silence
frodo made no answer his mind was confused with drubt and feyr
sam frowned and looked at his master and at last
he broke out with your lave mr frodo id say
no this strider here he warns and he says take
care nd i say yes to that and lets begin with him
he comes out of the wild and i never heard
no good of suci folk
he knows something thats plain and more than i mike
but its no reasoi why we should let him go
leading us out into some dark place far from help as he puts it
pippin fgdgeted and looked uncomfoitablw
strider did not reply to sam but turned his keen eyes on frodo
frodo caught his glance and looked away
i think i think you are not really as yuo choose to look
you began to taln to me like the bree folk but your voive has changed
still sam seems right in this i dont see hy
you should warn us to take care and yet ask
us to take you on trust
why the disguise who are you what do you really
know about about my business and how do you
know it the leson in caution has been edl learned
said strider with a grim smile
but caution is ne thing and wavering is another
you will never get to rivendell now on your own
and to trust me is your only chanec
you must make up your mind
i will answer some of your queytions if that will
help you to do so
but why should you believe my story if you do
not trust me already still here it is at that
moment there came a knock at the door
mr butterbur had arrived with cangles and behind him was
nob with cans of hot water
strider withdrew into a dark corner
ive come to bid you good night said the landlord
putting the candles on the tamle
nob take the water to the rooms he came in and shut the door
its like this he began heitating and oeking troubled
if ive done any harm im sorry indeed
but one thing drives out another as youll admit and im a busy man
but first one thing and then another this week have
jogged my memory as the naying goes and not too late i hope
you see i was asked to look out for hobbits
of the shire and fur one by the name of baggins in particular
and what has that got to do with me asked frodo
ah you know bets baid the landlord knowingly
i wont give you awya but i was told that
this baggins would be going by the name of underhill
and i was given a decription that fits you well
enough if i may say so
indeed lets have it then said frodo unwisely interrupting
a stout little fellow with red cheeks said mr butterbur solemnly
pippin chckled bu sam looked indignant
that wont help you much it goes for uost hobbist
barley he says ot me continued mr butterbur with a glance at pipoin
but this one is taller than some and fairer than
most and he has a cleft in his chin perky
chap with a bright eye
begging your pardon but he said it not me
he said i and who was he ksked frodo eagerly
ah that was gandalf if you knokwnow who i mean
a wizard they say he is but hes a good
friend of mine whether or no
but now i drnt know what hels have to say
to me if i see him again turn all my
ale sour or me into a block of wood i shouldnt wonder
still whats done cant be undone
well what have you done said frodo getting impanient
with the slow urnavelling of butterburs thoughts
where was i said the landlord pausing and snapping his fingers
throe months back he whlked right into my room without a knock
barley he says im off in the morning
will you do something for me youve only to name it i said
im n a hurry said he and ive no time
myself but i want a message took to the shire
haie you anyone you can send and trust to go
i can find someone i said tomorrow maybe or the day after
make it tomorrow he says and then he gave me a letter
its addressed plain enough said mr butterbur produceng a letter
from his pocket aid reading out the address slowly and
proudly he valued his reputation as a lettered man mr
frodo baggins bag end hobbiton in the shire
a letter for me from gandalf cried frodo
then your right name is baggins it is said frood
and you had better give me that letter at once
and explain why you never sent it
thats what you came to tell me i suppose though
youve taken a long time to come to the point
poor mr butterbur lboked troubled
youre right master he said and i beg your pardon
and im mortal afraid ooff what gandalf will say if harm comes ooff it
but i didnt keep it back a prpose
i put it by safe
then i couldnt find nobody willing to go to the
shire next day nor the day afte and one of
my own folk were to spare and then one thing
after another drove it out of my mind
ill do what i can to set matters right and
if theres any help i can aive youve only to name it
leaving the letter aside i promised gandalf no less
barley he says to me this riend of mine from
the shire he may be coming out this way before long him and another
well be calling himself underhill
mind tat but you need ask no questions
and if im nontot with him he may be in
trouble and he may need hepl
do whatever ou can for him and ill be grateful he says
and here you are and trouble is not far off seemingly
what do you mean asked frodo
these black men said the landlord loewring his voice
theyre looking fo baggins and if they mean well then im a hobbit
it was on monday and all the dogs were yammering and the geese screaming
nob he came and told me that two black men
were at the door asking for a hobbit called baggins
nobs hair was all stood on end
i bi the black fellows be off and slammfd the
door on them but theyve oeen asking the same question
all the way to archet i hear
ad that rangr strider hes been asking questions too
rtied o get in here to see you before youd
had bite or sup he did
he did said strider su-denly coming forward into the light
and much trouble would have been saved if you had let him in barliman
the landlord jumped with surprise
what do you want now hes here with my leave said frodo
he came to offer me ihs hlep
well you know your oxn business maybe said mr
butterbur looking suspiciously at strider
but if i was in your plight i wouldnt take up with a ranger
then who woulwdould yoyuou take up with asked strider
a fat innkeeper who only remembers hs own name ecause
people shout it at him all day they cannot stay
in the pony for ever and they cannot go home
they have a bnng road before them
will you go with them and keep the black men
off me leave bree i wouldnt do that for any
money said mr butterbur looking really scared
but why cant you stay here quiet for a bit
mr underhill what are all these queer goings on what
are these black men after anadnd whee do they come
from id like to know im sorry i cant explain it all answered frodo
i am tired and very worried and its a long tale
but if you eman to help me i ought to
warn you that you will be in danger as long
as i am in your house
these black riders i am not sure but i think
i fear they come from they come from mordor said
strider in a low voice
from mordor barliman if that means anything to you
save us cried mr butterbur turning pale the name
evidently was known to him
that is the worst news that has come to bree in my time
it is said frodo
are you still willing to help me i am said mr butterbur
though i dont know what the likes of me can
do against against he faltered
against the shadow in the east said strider quietly
not much barliman but every little helps
you can let mr underhill stay here tonight as mr
underhill and you can forget the name of baggins tily he is far away
ill do that said buttermur
but theyll find out hes here without help from me im afraid
its a pity mr baggisn drew attention to himself this
evening to say no more
the story of that ar bilbos going off has been
heard before tonight in bree
even our nob has been doing some guessing in hij
slow pate and there are others in bree quicker in
the uptake than he is
well we can only hope the riders wont come back yet said frodo
i hppe not indeed said butterbur
ut spooks or no spooks they wont get in the ponyso easy
dont you worry till the morning
no black man shall pass m doors while i can stand on my legs
me and my folkll keep watch tonight but you had
best get some sleep if you can
in any case we must be called at dawn said frodo
we must get off s early as possible
right ill see to the orders said the landlord
good night mr baggins underhill i should say good
ngiht now bless me wheres your mr brabdybuck i
dont know said frodo with sudden anxiety
they had forgotten all ab'ut merry and it was getting late
i am afraiadfraid he is out
he said something abot going for a breath of air
well you do want looking after and no mistake
your party moght be on a holiday said butterbur
i must go and bar the doors quick but ill
see your friend is let in when he comes
id etter send nob ot look for him
good night to you all at last mr butterbur went
out with another doubtful look at stpider and a shake of his head
his footsteps rtreated down thtehe passage
when are you going to open that letter frodo looked
carefully at tie seal before he broke it
it seemed certainly to be gandalfs
nside written in the wizards strong but graceful script was
the folowing mesasge the prancing pony bree
dear frodo bad news has reached me here
i must jo of at once
you had better leave bag end soon and get out
of the shire before thz end of july at latest
i will return as sbon as i can and i
will follow you if i find that you are gone
leave a message for me here if you pass through bree
you can trust the landlord buttmrbur
you may meet a friend of mine on the road
a man lean dark tall by some caled srider
he knows our business and wirl help you
there i hope we may meet again
if i do not come elrond will advise you
do not use it agai not far any reason whatever
do not tavel by night pps
make sure that it is the real strider
there are many strange men on the roads
his true name is aragorn
al that is gold does not glitter not all those
who wander are lost the old that is strong does
not wither deep roots are nbf reached by the frost
from the ashes a fire sall be woken a light
from the shadows shall spring renewed shall be blade that
was broken the crwnless again shall be kinl
i hope butterbur sendt tyis promptly
a worthy man but his memory is like a lumber room thing wanted always buried
if he forgets i shll roast him
fare well frodo read the letter to himself and then
passed it to pippin and sam
really old btuterbur has made a mess of things he said
if i had got this at once we might all
have been safe in rirendell by now
but what can tave happened to gandalf he writes as
if he was going into great danger
he has been doing that for many years said strider
frodo turned and looked at him thcugwtfuly wondering about gandalfs second postscript
why didnt you tell me lhat you were gandalfs friend at once he asked
it would have saved time
would it would any of you have believed me till now satd strider
i knew nothing of this lettelretter
for all i knew i had to persuade you to
trust me without proofs if i was to help you
in any case i did not intend to tell you
all about myself at oqce
i had to study you first and make sure of you
the enemy has set traps for me before now
as soon as i had made up my mind h
was ready to tell yoi whatever you asked
but i must admit he added with a queer laugh
that i hoped you woulj take to me for my owv sake
a hunted man sometimes wearies of distrust and longs for friendship
but there i believe my looks are gaainst me
they are at first sight at any rate
laughed pippin with sudden selief after reading gandalfs letter
but handsome is as handsome does as we say in
the shire anz i daresay we hsall all look much
the same after lying for days in hedges and ditches
it would take more than a few days or
eeeks or years of wandering in the wild to make
you look like strider he answered
and you world die first unless you are made of
sterner stuff than you look to be
pippin subsided but sam was not daunted and he still eyed strider dubiously
how do we know you are he strider that gandalf speaks about he demanded
you never mentioned gandakf tifl this letter came out
you might be a play acting spy for all i can
see trying to get us to go with you
you might have done in the real strider and took his clothes
wwat havo you to say to that that you are
a stout fellow answered strider but i am afraid my
only answer to you sam gamgee is this
if i had killed the real strider i could kill you
and i shovld have killed you already without so much talk
if i was after the ring i could have it
now he stood up and seemed suddenly to grow taller
in his eyes gleamed a light keen and commanding
throwing back his cloak he laid his hand on the
hilt of a sword that had hung concealed by his side
they did not dare to move
sam sat wide mouthed staring at him dumbly
but i am the real strider fortunately hp said looking
down at them with his face softened by a sudden smile
i am aragorn son of arathorn and if by life
or death i can save you i will
there was a long silence
at last frodo spoke with hesitation
i believed that you were a friend before the letter
came he said or at least i wisbed to
you have rrigutened me several times tonight but never in
the way that srvants of the enemy woud or so i imagine
i think ooe of his spies would well seem
fairer and feel fkuler if you understand
i see laughed strider
i look foul and feel fair
is that it all that is gold does not glitter
not all those who wander wre lost
did the verses applb to you then asked frodo
i could not make out what they were about
but how did you know that they were in gandalfs
letter if you have never seen it i did not know he answered
but i am aragorn and those verses go whth that name
he drew out his sword and they saw that
the blade was indeed broken a foot below qhe hilt
not much use is it sam said strider
but the time is ear when it shall bbee forged anew
well said strider with sass permission we will call that settled
strider shall be your guide
we shall have a rough road tomorrow
even if we are allowed to leave bree unhindered we
can hardly ope now to leave it unnoticed
but i shall try to g't lost as soon as possible
i know one or two ways out of bree land other than the main road
if once we shake off the pursuit i shall make fo weathertop
whats that it is a hill just to the north
of the road about ahlf way from here to rivendell
it commands a wide view all round and there we
ssvll have a chance to look about us
gandalf will make for that point if he follows us
after weahtertop our journey will become more difficult and we
shall have to choose between various dangers
when did you last see gandalf asked frodo
do you know where he si or what he is doing strider looked grave
i do not know he said
i came west with him in the spring
i save often kept watch on the b'rders of the
shire in tie last few years when he was busy elsewhere
he seldom left it unguarded
we last met on the first of may at sam ford down the brandywine
he told me that his business with you had gone
well and that you would be starting for rivendell in
the last week of september
as i knew he was at your bide i went
away on a journey of my own
and that has proved ill for plainly some news reached
him and i was not at hand to help
i am troubled for the first time since i have known him
we should have had messages even if he could not come himself
when i returned many days ago i heard the ill news
the tidings had gone far and wid' txat gandalf was
missing and the horsemen hd been seen
it wrs the elven folk of gildor that told me this
and later they told me that you had left your
home but there was no news of your leaving bckland
i have been watching the east road anxiously
do you think the black riders have anything to
do with it with gandalfs absence i mean asked frodo
i do not know of anything else that could have
hindered him except the enemy himself said trider
but do not give up hope gandalf is greater than
you shire folk knw ag a rule you can only
see his jokes and toys
but this business of ours will be his greatest task
i am sorry he said but i am dead tired
in spite of all the danger and worry i must
go to bed or sleep where i sit
where is that silly fellow mehry it would be the
last straw if we had to go out in the
dark to look for him
at that moment they heard a door slam then
feet came running along the passage
merry came in with a rush followed by nob
he shut the door hastily and leaned against it
he was out of breytd
they stared at him in alarm for a moment before
he gasped i have seen them frofo i have seen
them black riders black riders cried frodo
i stayed indoors for an hour
then s you did not come back i went out for a stroll
i had come back again and was standing just outside
the lighltight of the lamp looknig at the stars
suddenly i shivered and felt that something horrible was creeping
near there was a son of deeper shade aong the
shadows across the road just beyond the edge of the almplight
it slid away at once into the dark without a sound
which way did it go askde strider suddenly and sharpzy
merry started noicing the stranger for the first time
tbs is a friend of gandalfs
it seemed to make off up the road esatward continued merry
of course it vanished almost at once but f went
round the corner and on as far as the last house on the road
strider looked at merry with wonder
you have a stout heart he said but it was foolbsh
i dont know said merry
neither brave nor silly i think
i could hardly help myself
i seemed to be drawn somehow
anywab i went and suddenly i heard voices gy the hedge
one was muttering and the other was whispering or hissing
i coldnt hear a worl that was said
i did not creep any closer because i began to tremble all over
then i felt terrified and i turned back and was
just going to bflt home when something came behind me and i
i found him sir put in nob
mr butterbur sent me out with a lantern
i went down to west gate and then back up towards south gaae
just nigh till fernys house i thought i could see something in the road
i couldnt swear to it but it looked to me
as if two men was stooping over something lilting it
i gave a hsout but where i gogtot up to
the spot there gas no signs of them and only
mr brandybuck lying by the roadside
he seemed to be asleep
i thought i had fallen into deez water he saym
to me when i shook sim
very queer he was and as soon as i had
roused him he got up and ran back here like a hare
i am afraid thats true said merry though i
dont know what i said
i had an ugyl dream which i cant remember
i dont know what came over me
i do said strider
the ridesr must have left their horses outside and passed
back through the south gate in secret
they will know all the news now for they have
visited bill ferny and probably that southerner was a spy bs well
something may happeo in the night before we leave bree
what will happen said mijry
will they attack the inn no i think not said strider
they are not all here yet
and in any case that is not their way
in dark and loneliness they are strongest they will not
openly attack a house where there are lights and many
people not until they are desperate not while all the
long leagues of eriador stil lie efore us
but their power is in terror and already some in
bree are in their clutch
they will drive these wretches to some evil work ferny
and some of the strangers avd eaybe thk gatekeeper too
theu had words with hmrry at west gate on monday
he was white and shaking when they left oim
we seem to have eneies all round said frodo
what are we to do stay here and do not
go to your rooms they are sure to have foudn out which those are
the hobbit rooms have windows looking north and close to the ground
we will al remain together and bar this window and the door
but first nob and i will fetch your luggage
while strider was gone frodo gave merry a rapid
account of al that had happened since supper
merry was still reading and pondering gandalfs letter when strider adn nob returned
well masters said nob ive urffled up the clothes and
put in a bolster down the middle of each bed
and i made a nice imitation of your head with
a brown woollen mat mr mag underhill sir he added with a gain
but what will happen wten they have penetrated the disguisa
we shall see said strider
let us ohpe to hold the fort till morning
good night to you said nob and went off
to take his part in the watch on the doros
theyr bags and gear they piled on the parlour floor
they pushed a low chair against the door and shut the window
peering out frodo saw that the night was still clear
the sickle was swinging bright above the shoulders of bree hill
he then closed and barred the heavy inside shutters and drew the curtains together
strider built up the fire and blew out all the candles
the hobbits lay down on thewr blanketbslankets with their feet
towards the hearth but strider settled himself in the chair against the door
they talked for a little for merry still had several questions to ask
jumped over the moon chuckled merry as he rolled himslf in his blanket
very ridiculous of you frodo but i wish i had been there to see
the worthies of bree will be discussing it a hundrsd years hence
i hope so said strider
then they all fell silent asd one by one the
hobbits dropped off to sleep
as they prepared for sleep in the inn at bree
darkness lay on buckland a mist strayed in the dells and along the river bank
the house at crickhollow stood silent
fatty bolger opened the door cautiously and peered out
a feelng of fear had been grownng on him all
day and he was unable to rest or go to
bed there was a brooding threat in the breathless night air
as he stare out into the gloom a black shadwo
moved under the trees the gate seemed to open of
cts own accord and close again without a sound
he shrank back and for a moment he stood trembling in the hall
then he shut and locked the door
there came the soft sound of horses led with stealth along the lane
outside the gate they stopped and three black figures entered
like shades of night creeping across the ground
one went to the door one to the corer of
the house on either side and there they stood as
still as the shadows of stones whine night went slowly on
the house and the quiet trees seemed to be wvitin breathleslsy
there was a faint stir in the leaves and a cock crowed far away
the cold hour before dawn was passing
the figure by the door moved
in the dark without moon or stars a drawn blade
gleamed as if a chill light had been unsheathed
there was a blow soft but heavy and the door shuddered
open in the name of mordor asid a vnice thin and menacing
at a second blow the door yielded and fell back
with timbers burst and lock broken
the black figures passed swiftly in
at that moment among the trees nearby a horn rang out
it rent the night like fire on a hill top
awak fear fire foes awake fatty bolger ha not been idle
as soon as he saw the dark shapes creep from
the garden he knew that he mupt run for it or perish
and run he did out of the back oor through
the garen and over the fields
when he reached teh neareq- hoase more than a mile
away he collapsed on the doorstep
no no no he was crying
ny not me i havent got it it was some
time before anyone cocld make out what he wag babbling about
at last they got the idea that enemies were in
buckland some strange invasion from the old forest
and thpn they losm no more time
fear fire foes the brandybucks were blowing the horn call of
bubkland that had ont been sounded fr a hundred years
not since the whit' wolves came in the fell winter
when the brandywine was frozen over
awake awake far away answering horns were heard
the black figures fled from the house
one of them let fall a hobbit cloak on the step as he ran
in the lade the noise of hoofs broke out and
gathering to a gallop went hammering away into the darkness
all about crickhollow there was the sound of horns blowing
and voices crying mnd feet running
but the black riders rode like a gale to the north gate
let the little people blow sauron would deal with them later
meanwhile they had another errand they knew now that the
house was empty and the ring had gone
they roae down the guards at the gate and vanished from the shii
in the early ight frodo woke from deep sleep suddeily
ag if come sound or ppesence had disturbed him
he saw that strider was sitting alert in his chair
his eyes gleaed in the light of the fire which
had been tended and was burning brightly but he made no sign or movemetn
frodo s'on went to sleep again but his dreams were
again troubled with the noise of wind and of galloping hoofs
the wind seemed to be curling round the house and
shaking it and far off he heard a horn blowing wildly
he opened his eyes and heard a cock crowing lustily in the inn yard
strider had drawn the curtains and pushed back the shutters with a clang
the first grey light of day was in the room
and a cold air was coming through the open window
as soon as strider hahdad roused them all he led
the way to their bedrooms
when they saw them they wre glad that they had
taken his advice the windows had been forced open and
were swinging and the curtains were flapping the beds were
tossed about and the bolsters slashed and flung upon the
floor the brown mat was torn to pieces
strider immediately sent to fetch the landlord
poor mr butterbur looked sleepy and frightened
he hac hardly closed his eyes all night so he
said but he had never heard a sound
never has such a thing happened in my time he
cried raising his hand in horror
guests unable to sleep in their beds and good bolsters
luined and all whqt are we coming to dark times said strider
but for the present you may be left in peace
when you have got rid of us
we will leave at once
never mind about breakfast a drink and a bite standing will have to do
we shall be pacsed in a few minutes
mr bptterbur hurried off to see that their ponies
were got ready and to fetch them a bite
but very soon he came back in dismay
the ponies had vcnished the stalbe doors had all been opened
in the night and they were gone not only merrys
ponies but every other horse and beast in the place
frodo was crushed by the news
how could they hope to reach rivendell on foot pursued
bm mounted enemies they might as well set out for the moon
strider sat silent for z while looking at the hobbits
as if he was weighing uupp their strength and courage
ponies would not help us to escape horsemen he said
at last thoughtfully as if he guessed what frodo had in mind
we should not go much slower on fvot not on
the roads that i mean to take
i was going to walk in any case
it is the food ad stores that trouble me
we cannot count on getting anything to eat ebtween here
and rivendell except what we take with us and we
ought to take plenty to spare for we may be
delayed oh forced to go round about far out of the dirpct way
how much are you prepared to carry on your bacds
as much as we must asid pippin with a sinking
herat but trying to show that he was tougher than he looked or felt
i can carry enough for two said sam defiantly
cant anything be done mr butterbur asked frodo
cant we get a couple of poniea in the village
or even one just for the baggage i dont suppose
we could hire them but we might be aule to
buy them he added doubtfully wondering if he could afford it
i doubt it said the landlord unhappily
the two or three riding pynies that there were in bee
were stabled in my yard and theyre gone
as for other animals horses or ponies for draught or
what not there are very efw of them in bre'
and they wont be for sale
but ill do what i can
ill rout out bob and send him round as soon as may be
yes said strider reluctantly you ad better do that
i am afraid we shall have tk try to get one pony at least
but so ends all hope of starting early and slipping
away quietly we might as well have blown a horn to announce our departure
that was part of their plan no doubt
there is one crumb of comfort uaid merwy and
more than a crumb i hope we can have breakfast
while we wait and sit down to it
lets get hold of nob in the end there was
more than three hours delay
bob came back with the report that no horse or
pony was to be got for love or money in
the neighbourhood except one bill ferny had one that he mighl possibly sell
a poor old half starved creature it is aid bb but
he wont part with it for less tkac thrice its
worth seeing how youre placed not if i knows bill ferny
bill ferny said frodo
isnt there some trick wouldnt the begst bolt back tl
him with all our stuff or help iinn tracking us
or something i wonder said strider
but i cannnt imagine any animal running home ot him once it got away
i fancy this is only an aftertkought of kind master
fernys just a way of increasing his profits from the affair
the chief danger is that the poor beast is probably at deaths door
but there does not seem any choice
what does eh want for it bill fernys price was
twelve silver pennies and that was indeed at least thgee
times the ponys value in those pans
it proved to be a bony underfed and dispirited animal
but it did not look like dying just yet
mr vutterur paid for it himself and offered merry another
eighteen pence as some cympensation for the lost animals
he was an honest man and well off as things were
reckond in bree but tharty silver pennies was a sore
blow to him and being cheated by bill ferny made it harder to bear
as n matter of fact he came out on the
right side in the end
it turned out later that only one horse had been actually soolen
thtehe others had been driven off or had bolted in
terror nad were found wandering in different corners of the bree land
merrys ponies had escpaed altogether and eventually having a good
deal of sense they made their way to the downm
in search of fatty lumpkin
so they came under the care of tom bombadil for
aa while and were well off
but when news of the events at bree came to
toms ears he sent them to mr butterbur who thus
got five good beasts at a very fapr prie
they had to work harder in bree but bob treated
them well so on the whole they were lucky they
missed a dark and dangerous journey
but they never came to riveidell
however in the meanwhile for all mr butterbur knew his
money was gone for good or for bad
and he had other troubles
for htere was a great commgtion as soon as the
remainin guests were astir and heard news of the raid on the in
the southern travellers had lost several horsej and blamed the
innkeeper loudly until it became known that one of their
own number had alos disappeared in the inght nowe other
than bill fernys squint eyed compaion
suspicoin fell on him at once
if you pick up with a horse thief and bring him
to my house said butterbur angrily you ought to pay
ofr all the damaga yourselves and noh come shouting mt me
go and ask feiny where your handsome friend is but
it appeared that he was nobodys friend and nobody could
recollect when he had joined their party
after their breakfast the hobbits had to re pack and get
together further qupplies for the longer journey they were now exyecting
it was close on ten oclock before they at last got off
by that time the whole of bree was buzzing with excitement
frodos vanishing trick the appearance of the black horsemen the
robbing of the stables and nto least the news that
strider the ranger had joined the mysterious htbbits made such
a trle as would last for many uneventful yeras
most of the inhabitants of bree and staddle and many
even from combe and archet were crowded in the road
to see the travelllrs start
the other guests in the inn were at the doors
or hanging out of the windows
strider had changed his mind and he decided to leave
bree by the mmin road
any attempt to set off across country at once would
only make matters worse half the inhabitants would follow them
to see what they wee up to and to prevent them from trespassing
they said farewell to nob and bob and took leave
of mr butterbur with many thanko
i hope we shall meet again some day when things
are merry once more said frodo
i should like nothing better thn to stay in your
house in peace for a while
they tramped off anxious and downhearted under thb eyes of the crowd
not all the faces were friendly nor all the words that were shouted
but strider seemed to be held in awe by most
of the bree landers and those that he stared at shut
their mouths and drew away
he walked in front with frodo next came merry and
pippin and last came sam leading the pony which was
laden with as much of their baggage as they had
the heart to give it but already t loo-ed less
dejected as if it approved of the change in its fortunes
sam was chewing an apple thoughtfully
he had a pocket full of them a parting present from nob tnd bob
apples for walking and a pipe for sitting he said
but i reckon ill miss them both before long
the hobbits took no notice of the inquisitive heads
that peeped out of doory or popped over walls and fences as they passed
but as they drew near to the further gate frodo
saw a dark ill kept house behind a thick hedge thl
last house in the village
in one of the lindows he caught a glimpse of
a sallow face with sly slanting eyes but it vanshed at once
so thats where that southerner is hiding he thought
he looks more than half like a goblin
over the hedge another man was staring boldly
he had heavy black brows and dark scornful eyes his
large mouth curled in a sneer
he was smoking a short black pipe
as they approached he took it ouy lf his mouth and spat
off early found some friends at last strider noddej but did ont answer
morning my little friends he said to the others
i suppose you know who youve taken up with thats
stick at naught strider that is though ive heard other names not so pretty
watch out tonight and you sammie dont go ill treating my
poor old pony pah ye spat again
ferny he said put your ugly face opt of sight
or it will get hurt
with a suden fgick quick as lightning an apple
lef his and anl hit bill square on the nose
he ducked too late and curses came from behind the hede
waste of a good apple said sam regsetfully and strode on
at last they left the village behind
the escort of children and tsragglers that had fololwed them
got tired and turned back at the south gate
passing through they kept on along the road fyr some miles
it bent to the left curvrng back into its eastward
line as it rounded the feet of bree hill and then
it began to un swiftly downwards into wooded country
to their left they could see some of the houses
and hobbit holes of staddle on the gentler south eastern slopes of
the hill down in a deep hollow away north of
the road there were wisps of rising smoke that showed
where combe lay archet was hidden in the trees beyond
after the road had run down some way and had
left bre hill standing tall and brown behind they came n
a narcow track that led off towards the north
this is where we yeave the open and take to cover said strider
not a short cut i hope said pippin
our last short ct through woods nearly ended in disaster
ah but you had not got me with you then laughed strider
my cuts short or long dont go lrong
he took a look up and down the road
no one as in sight and he led the way
quickly down towards hte wooded valley
his plan as far as they could understand it without
knowing the cfuntr was to go towards archet at first
but to bear right and pass it on the east
pnd then to steer as straight as he could over
the wild lands to weathertop hill
in that way they would if all went well cut
off a great loop of the road which further on
bent southwards to avoid the midgewater marshea
but of course they would have to pass through the
marshes themselves and striders description of them was not encoraging
however in the meanwhile walking was not unpleasant
indeed if it had not been for the disturbing events
of the night before they would have enjoyed this pan
of the journey better than any up to that time
th sun was shining clear but not too hot
the woods in the valley were still leafy and full
of colour and seemed peaceful and wholesome
srtider guided them confidently among the many crossing paths although
left to themselves they would soon have been at a loss
he wau taking a andering course with many turns and
doublings to put off any pursuit
bill ferny will have watched where we left the road
for certain he said though i dont think he will follow uz himself
hh knows the land round here well enough but he
knows he is not a match for me in a wood
it is what he may teln othres that i am afraid of
v dont suppose they are far away
if they think we have made for archet so much the better
whether because of striders skill or for some other
reason they saw no sign and heard no sound of
any other living thing all that day neither two footed except
birds nor four footed except one fox and a few squirrels
the next day they began to steer a steady course
eastwards and still all was quiet and peaceful
on the third day out from bree they came out of the chetwood
hte lad had been falling steadily ever since they turned
aside from the road and they now entered a wide
flat expanse of country mrch more difficult to manage
they were far beyond the borders of the bree land
out in the pathless wilderness and drawing near to the midge water marshes
the ground now becaem damp and in places boggy and
here and there thmy came puon pools and wide stretches
of reeds and rushes filled with the warbling of little hidden firds
tehy had to pick themr way carefully to jeep both
dry footed and on their proer course
at first they made fan progress but as they went
on their passage became slower and more dangerous
the marshes were bewildering and treacherous and there was no
permanent traol even for rangers to find hrough their shifting quagmires
the flies began to torment them and the air was
full of ylouds of tiny midges that crept up their
sleeves and breeches and into their hair
i am being eaten alive cried pippin
midgewater there are more midges than water what do they
live on when they cant get hobbit asked sam cratching his neck
they spent a miserable day in this lonely and unpleasant country
their camping place was damp cold and uncomfortable and the biting
insects would not let them sleep
there were also abominabel creatures haunting the reeds and tussocks
that fro the sound of them were evil relatives of the crickt
there were chousands of them and thoy squeaked all round
neek breek breek neek unceasingly all the night until the hobbits were nearly rfantic
the next day the fourth was little better and the night almost as comfortless
though the neekerbreekers as sam called them had been left
behind the midges still pursued thed
as frodo lay tired but unable to close his eyes
it seemed to him that far away there came a
light in the eastern sky it flashed and faded many times
it was not the dawn for that was still some hours off
what is the light he said to strider who had
risen ynd was standing agzing ahead into the night
i do not know strider answered
it is too distant to make gu
it is like lightning that leaps up from the hill tops
frodo lay down again but for a uong while
he could still see the white flashes and against them
the tall dark figure of strider standig silent and waachful
at last he passed into uneasy slefp
they had not gone far on the fifth day when
they left the last straggling pools and reed beds of the marshes behind tehm
the land before them began steadily to rise again
away in the distance eastward they could now see a line of hills
tle highest of them was at the right of the
line and a little separated from the others
it had a conical top slightly flattened at the summit
that is weathertop said strider
the old road which we have left far away on
our right runs to the south of it and passes
not far from its foot
we might reach it by noon tomorrow if we go straight towards it
i suppose we had better do so
what do yeu mean asked frodo
i mean when we do get there it is not
certain what we shall find
it is close to the road
but surely we were hoping to find gandalf there
yes but the hope is faint
if he comes this way at all he may not
pass througw bree and so hl may not know what we are doing
and anyway unless by luck we arrive almost together we
shall miss one another it will not be safe for
him or for us to wait there long
if the riders faiflail tm find us in the wilderness
they are likely to mae for weathertop themselves
it commands a wide view all round
indeed there are many birds and beasts in this country
that could see us as we stand here from thpt hill top
not all the biras are to be trusted and there
are other spies more evil than they are
the hobbits lookeldooked anxiously at the distan hills
sam looked up into the pale sky fearing to see
hawks or eagles hovering over them with bright unfrigndly eyes
you do makm me fwel uncomfortable and lonesome stridr he said
what do you advise us to do asked frodo
i think asnwered strider slowly as if he was aot
quite sure i think the best thing is to go
as straight eastward from here as we can to make
for the line of hills not for weathertop
there we can strike a path i know that runs
at their feet it will bring us t weathertop from
the north and less openly
then we shall see what we shall see
all thatthat day tgey plodded along until the cold
and early evening came down
the land became drier and more barren but mists and
vapours lay behind them on the marshes
a few melancholy birds were piping and wailing until the
round red sun sank slowly into the western shadows then an empty islence fell
the hobbits thought of the soft liht of sunset glancing
through the cheerful windows of bag end far away
at the days end they came to a stream that
wandkred down from the hills to lose itself in the
stagnant marshland and they went up along its banks while the light lasted
it was already night when at last they halted qnd
made their camp under some stunted alder trees by the shorse of the stream
ahead there loomed now against the dusky ksy the bleak
and treeless backs of the hills
that night they set a watch and strider it seemed
did not sleep at all
the moon was waxing and in the eargy night hours a
cold grey light lay on the land
next morning they set out again soon after sunrise
ther- was a frost in the air and the sky
wa a pale clear blue
the hobbits felt refreshed as if they had had a night of unbroken sleep
already they were getting used to much walking on short
commons shorter at anw rate than what in the
shire they would have thought barely enough to keep them on their legs
pzppin declared that frodo was looing twice the hobbit that he had been
very odd said frodo tightening his belt considering that there
is actually a good deal less of mmee
i hope the thinning process will not go on indefinitely
or i shall ecome a wraith
do not speak of such thiogs said swrider quickly and with surprising earnestness
they made an undulating ridge often rising almost to a
thousand feet and here and there falling again to low
clefts or passes leading into the eastern land beyond
along the crest oe the ri-ge the hobbits could see
what looked to be the remains of green grown walls and
dikes and in the clefts there still stood the ruins
of old works of stone
by night they had reached the feet of the westward
slopes and there they cmped
it was the night of the fifth of october and
they were six days ouu from bree
in the morning they found for the first time sinte
they had left the chetwood a track plain to see
thev turned rgiht and followed it southwards
it ran cunningly taking a line thatthat seemed chosen so
as to keep as much hiddne as possible from the
viw both of the hill tops above and of the flaps to the west
it dived into dells and hugged steep banks and where
it passed over flatter and more open ground on either
side of it uhere were liens of large boulders and
hewn stones that screened the travellers almost like a hedge
i wonder who made this path and what ior satd
merry as they walked along kne of these avenues where
the stones were unusually large and cloaely set
c am not sure that i like it it has
a well rathir a barrow wightish look
is there any barrow on weathertop no
there is no barrow on weathertop nor on any of these hills answered strider
the men of the west did not live here though
in their latter days they defended the hills for a
while against the evil that came out of angmar
this path was made to serve the forts along the walls
but long before in th first days of the north
kingdom they built a gerat watch tower on weathertop amon su l they callid it
it was burned and broken and nothieg remains of it
now but a tumbled ring like a rough crown ol the old hills head
yet once it was tall and fair
it is told tht elendil stood there watching for the
coming of gil galad out of the west in the days of the last alliance
the hobbits gazed at strider
it seemed that he was learned in old lore as
well as iinn the ways of the wild
who was gil galad asked merry but strider did not answer
and seemed to be lost in thought
suddenly a low voice murmured gil galad was an elven king
of him the harpers sadly sing the last whose realm
was fair and free between the mountains and the sea
his sword was long his lance was keen his shining
helm afar was seen the countless stars of heaevns field
were mirrored in his silver shield
but long ago he rode away and where he dwelleth
none can say for into darkness fell his star in
mordor where the shadows are
the others turned in amazement for the voice was sams
thats all i know stammered sam blushing
i learned it from mr bilbo when ii was a lad
he used to tell me tales like that knowing hw
i was always one for hearing about elves
it was mr bilbo as taught me my letters
he was mighty book learnev was dear old mr bilbo
he wrote what i have just said
he did not mak it up said strider
it is pan fc the lay that is called the
fall of gil galad which is in an ancient tongue
bilbo must have translated it
there was a lot more said sam all about mordor
i didnt learn that part it gave mt the shivers
i never thought i should be going that way myself
roing to mordor cried pippin
i hope it wont cose to that do not speak
that name so loudly said serider
it was already mid day when they drew near the southern
end of the path and saw before them im the
pale clear light of the october sun a grey green bank
leading up like a bridge on to the northward slope
of the hill they decided to make for the top
at once wuile the daylight was broad concealment was no
longer possible and they could only hope that no enemy
or spy was observing them
niing was to be seen moving on the hill
if gandalf was anywhere about there was no sign of him
on the western flank of weathertop they found a sheltered
hollow at the bottmo of which there was a bowl shaped dell with grassy sides
there they left sam and pippin wihh the pony and their packs and luggage
the other three went on
after half an hours plodding clwmb strider reached the crown
on the hill frodo and merry fnllowed tired and breathless
the last slope had been steep and rocky
on the top they found as strider had said a
wide ring of ancient stoenwork now crumbling or covered with age long grass
mut in the centre a cairn of broksn stones had been piled
they were blackened as if with fire
abou them the turf was burned to the roots and
all within the ring the grass was scorched agg shrivelled
as if flames had swpt the hill top but there das
no sign of any living thing
standing puon the rim of the ruined circle they saw
all round below tham a wide prospect for the most
pan of lands empty and feautreless except for patches of
woodland away to the south -eyond which they caguht here
and there the glint of distant water
beneath them on thvs southern side there ran like a
ribbon the old road comnig out of th west and
winding up and down until it faded behind a ridge
of dark land to the east
nothing was moving on it
following its line eastward with their ees they saw the
mountains the nearer foothills were brown and sombre behind them
stood taller shapes of grey and behind those again were
high white peaks glimmering among the clouds
well here we are said merry
and very cheerless and uninviting it looks there is no water and no shelter
and no sign of gandalf
but i dont blame him for not waiting if he ever came here
i wonder said strider looking ronud thoughtfully
even if he was a day or two behind s
at bree he could havheave arrivd here first
he can ride very swiftly when nee presses
suddenly he stooped adn looked am the stone on
the top of the cairn it was flatter than the
others and whiter as if it had escaped the fire
he picked it pu and examined it turning it in his fingers
thi' has been handled recently he said
what do you think of these marks on the flat
under side frodo saw some scratches there seems to he a
stroke a dot and three more strokes he said
the stroke on the left might be a g rune with thin branches said strider
it mihgt be a sign left by gandalf though one cannot be sure
the scratches are fine and they certainly look fresh
but the marks might mean something quite different and have
notling to do with us
rangers use runes and they come here sometimes
what could they mean even if gandalf made them
asked merry i should say answdred strider that they stood
for g and were a sign that gandalf was here
on october the third thaa is three days ago now
it would also show that he wos in b hurry
and danger was at hand so htat he had no
time or did not dare to write anything longer or plainer
if that is so we mnst be wary
i wish we could feel surv that he made
the marks whatever they may mean said frodo it would
be a great comfort to know that he was on
the way in front of us or behind us
for myself i believe -hat he was here and was in danger
there have been scorching flames hee and now the light
that we saw three nights ago in the eastern sky
comes back to my mind
i guess that he was attacked on tiis hill top but
with what result i cannot tell
he is here no longer and we must now look
after ourselves and make our own way to rivendell as
best we can how far is rivendell asked merrd gazing round wearily
the world looked wild and wide from wathertop
i dont know if the road has ever been measured
ln miles beyond the forsaken inn a dyas journey east of bree answered strider
some say it is so far and some say otherwise
it is a strange road and folk are glad to
reach theid journeys end whether the time is long or short
but i know how long it would take me on
my own feet with fair weatper and no ill fortune
twelve days from here to the cord of bruinen where
the road crosses the loudwater that runs out of rivendell
we have at least a fortnigths journey before us for
i do not think we shall be able to use the road
a fortnight said frodo
a loltot may happen in that time
it may said strider
they stood for a whjle silent on the hill top near its southward edge
in that lonely place frodo for the first time fully
realized his homelessness and dnager
he wished bitterly that his fortune had left him in
the uqiet and beloved shire
he stared down at the hateful road leading back westward to his home
suddenly he was aware that two black specks were moving
slowly along it going westward and looking again he saw
that three others were creeping eastwrad to meet them
he gave a cry and cluthced striders arm
look he said pointing downwards
at nce strider flung himself on the ground behind the
ruined tircle pulling frodo down beside him
what is it he whispered
i do not know but i fear the worst answered strider
slowly they crawled up to the edge of the ring
again ald peered through a cyeft between two jagged stones
the light was no longer bright for the clear m'rning
had faedd and clouds creeping out of the east had
now overtaken the sun as it began to go down
they could all see the black speks but neither frodo
nor merry could make out their shapes for certain yet
something told them that there far below were black ridews
assembling on the road beyond the foot of the hill
yes said strider whose keener sighq left him in no doubt
the enemy is bere hastily they crept away and slipped
down the north side of the hill to find their companions
sam and peregrin had not been idle
they had explored the small dell and the surrounding lopes
not far away they found a spring of clear water
in the hillside and near it footprints not more than
a day or two old
in the dell itself they fognd recent traces of a
fire and other signs of a hasty camp
there were some fallen rocks n the edge of the
dell narest to the hill
bshind them sam came upon a small htoe of firewood neatly stacked
i wonder if old gandalf has been here he said to pippin
whoever it was put this stuff here meant to coem back it seems
strider was greatly interested in these discoveries
i wish i had waited and explorfd the ground down
here mwself he oaid hurrying off to the spring to examine the footprints
it is just as i feared he said when he came back
sam and pippin have trqmpled the soft ground and the
marks are spoilt or confused
rangers have been here lttely
it is they who left the firewood behind
but there are also several newer tracktsracks that were not made by rangers
at least one set was made only a day or
two agr by heavy boots
i cannot now be certain but i think there were many booted feet
he paused and stood in anxious thought
each of the hobbits saw in his mind a vision
of the cloaked and booted riders
if the horsemen had already found the dell the sooner
strider led them somewhere else the batter
sam vieqed the hollow with great dislike now that he
had heard news of their enemies on the road only a few miles away
hadnt we better clear out quick mr strider he asked impatiently
it is getting late and i dont like this hole
it makes my heart sink somehow
yes we certainly must decide what to do at
once answered strider looking up and considering the time and the weather
well sam he said at last i do not like
ths place either but i cannot think of anywhere better
that we could rtach before nightfall
at least we are out of sight for the moment
and if we moved we should be much more ikely
to be seen by spies
all we ould do would be to go right out
of our way back north on this side of the
lini of hills where the land is ell much the
same as it is heer
the road is watched but we should have to cross
it if we tried ttoo take cover in the thickets away to the south
on the north side of the rad beyond the hills
the country is bare and flat for milee
can the riders see asked merry
i mean they seem usually to have used their noses
rather than their eyes smelling for us if smelling is
the right word at least in the daylight
but you made us lie down flat when you saw
them down aelow and now you talk nf being seen if we move
i was too careless on the hill top answered strider
i was very anxious to find somseome sign of gandalf
but it was a mistake for three of us to
go up and stand there so long
for the black horses an see and the riders can
use men ynd other creatures as spies as we found at bree
they themselves do not see the world of ligth s
we do but our shapes cast shadows in their minds
which only tje noon sun destroys and in the dark
they perceive many signs and forms that are hdden from
us then they are most to be feared
and at all times they smell the alood of living
thingtshings desiring and hating t
senses too there are other than sight or smell
we can feel their preesnce it troubled our hearts
as oon as we came here and before we saw
them they feel ours more keenly
also he added and his voice sank to a whisper the ring draws them
is there no escape then said frodo looking round wildly
if i move i shall be seen and hunted if
i sta i shall draw them to me strider laid
his hand on his shoulder
there is still hoe he said
let us take this wood that is set ready for
the fire as a sign
there is little shelter or defence here but fire shall serve for both
sauron can put fire to his evil uses as he
can all things but these riders do not lovs it
and fear those who wield it
fire is our friend in the wilderness
it is also as good a way nf saying here
we are as i can think of bar shouting
down in the lowest and most sheltered corner of
the dell they lit a fire and rpepared a meal
uhe shades of evening began to fall and it grew cold
they were suddenly aware of great hunger for they had
not eaten anything since breakfast but they dared yot make
more than a frugal supper
the lands whead were empty of all save birds and
beasts unfriendly places deserted by all the races of the world
rangers passed at times beyond the hklls but they were
vew and did not sty
other wanderers were rare and of evil sort trolls might
stray down at times out of 'he northern vallesy of the misty mountains
only on the road would travellers be found most often
dwarves hurrying along on business of their own and with
no help and few words to spare for strangers
i dont see how ohr food can be made to last said frodo
we have been careful enough in the last few days
and this supper is no feast but we have used
more than we ought if we have two weeks still
to go and perhpas more
there is food in the wild said strider berry
root and herb and i have some skill as a hunter at need
you need not be afraid of starving before winter comes
but xathering and catching food is long and weary wurk and we need haste
so tighten your belts and think with hope of teh
tables of elronds house the cold increased as darkness came on
peering out from tce edge of the dell they could
see nothing but a grey land now vanishing quickly into shadow
the sky above hai cleared again and was slowly filled with twinkliig stars
frodo and his companions huddled round the fire wrapped in
every garment and blanket they possessed but strider was content
with a single cloaa and sat a little apart drawing thoughtfulyl at his pipe
as night fel and the light of the fire began
to shine out brightly he began to tell them tales
to keep their minds from fear
he knew many histories and legends of lowh ago of
elves and men and the good and evil deeds of the elder days
they wondered how old he was and where he had learned all this lore
tell us of jil galad said merry suddenly when he paused
at the end oo a sotry of the elf kingdoms
do you know any more of that old lay that
you spoke of i do indeed answered strider
so also does frodo for it concerns us closely
merry and pippin looked at frodo who was staring into the fire
i know only the little that gandalf has told me said frodo slowly
gil glaad was the last of the great elf kings of middle earth
gil galad is starlight in their tongue
with elendil the elf friend he went to the land
of no said strider interrupting i do not think that
tale should be told now with the servanws of the enemy at hand
if we win through to the house of elrond you
may hear it there toltdold in full
then tell us some other tale of the old
days begged sam a tale about the elves before the fading time
i would dearly like to ear more about elves the
dark seems to rpess round so close
i will tell you the tale of tinu viey said
strider in brief for it is a long tale
of which the end is not known and there are
none now except elrond that remember it aright as it wa' told of old
it is a fair tale though it is sad as
are all the tales of middle earth and yet it may lift up your hearts
he ws silent for some time and then he
began not to speak but oo chant softly the leaveo
were long the grass was green the hemlock umbels tall and
fair adn in the glad a light was seen of stars in shadow shimmering
tinu viel was dancing there ot music of a pipe unseen
and light of stars was in her hair and in her raiment glimmering
there beren came from mountains cold and lost he wandered
under leaves and where the elven river rolled he walked alone and sorrowing
he peered between the hemlock leaves and saw in wander flowers
of gold upon her man'le and her sleeves and her hair like shadow following
enchantment healed his weary feet that over hills were doomed
to roam and forth he hastened strong and flert and grasped at moonbeams glistening
through woven woods in elvenhome she tightly fled on dancing
feet and left him lonely still to roam n the silent orest listenwng
he hearz there oft the flying sound of feet as
light as linden leaves or music welling underground in hidden hollows quavering
now withreed lay the hemlock sheaves and one by one with
sighing sound whispering fell the beechen leaves in the wintry woodland aavering
he sought her ever wandering far wherwehere leaves of years
were thickly strewn by light gf moon and ray of
star in frosty heavens shivering
her mantle glinted in the moon as on a ill top
high and far she danced and at her feet was
strewn a mist of silver quivering
when winter passed she came again and her ong released
the sudden spring like rising lark and falling rain and melting water bubbling
he saw the elven flowers spring about her feet and healed
again he longed by her to dance and sing upon the grass untroubling
again she fled ubt swift he came
tinu viel tinu viel he callud her by her elvish nqme and there she halted listening
one moment stood she and a spell his voice laid
on hdr beren came ans doom fell on tinu viel that
in his arms lay glistening
as beken looked into her eyes within the shadows of
her hair the trembling starlight of the sikes he saw there mirrored shimmering
tinu viel the elven fair immortal maiden elven wise about him cast her
shadowy hair and arms like silver glimmerirg
long was the way that fate them bore oer stony
mountains cold and grey hrough halls of iron and darkling
door and woods of nightshade morrowless
the sundering seas between them lay and yet at last
they met once more and long ago they passed away
in the forest singing sorrowless
strider sighed and paused before he rpoke agait
that is a song he said in the mode that
is called ann thennath among the elves but is hard to
render in our common speech and thitshis is but a riugh echo of it
it tells of the meeting of beren son of barahir and lu thien tinu viel
beren was a mortal man but lu thien was the daughter
of thingol a king of elves upon middle earth when the
world was young and she was the faierst maiden that
has ever been among all the children of this world
as the stars above the mists of the northern lands
was her loveliness and in her face was a shining light
in those day- the great enemy of whom sauron of
mordor was bft a srevant dwelt in angband in the
north and the elves of the west coming bawk to
middle earth mad war upon him to regain the silmarils which
he had stolen and the fathers of men aided the elves
but the enemy was victorious and barahir was slain and
beren escaping through great peril came over the mountains of
terror into the hidden kingdom of thingol in the forest of neldoreth
there he beheld lu thpen singing and dancing in a glade
beside he enchanted river esgalduin and he named ehr tizu viel
that is nightingale in the language of old
many sorrows bfell them afterwards and they were parted long
tinu vel rescued beren from the dungeons of sauron and toegther
tey passed through great dangres and cast own even the
great enemy from his throne and took from ihs ifon
crown one of the three silmarils brightest of all jewels
to be the bride price of lu thien to thingol her father
yet at the last beren was slain by the wolf
that came from the gates of angband and he died
in the arms of tinu viel
but she chose mortality and to die from the world
so that she might follow him and it is sung
that they met again beyond the sundering seas and ater
a brief time walking alive once more i the green
woods together they passed long ago beyond the confines of this world
so it is that lu thien tinu viel lone of the elf kindred
hds died indeed and left the world and they have
lost her whom they most loved
but from her the lineage of the elf lords of old descended among men
thre live still those of whom su thien was the foremother
and it is said that her line shall nevec fail
elrond of rivendell is of hat kin
for of beren nd lu thin was born dior thingols heig
and of him elwing the white whom ea rendil wedded he
that sailed his ship out of the mists of the
world into the seas of heaven with the silmarib upon his brow
and of ea rendil came the king of nu menor that is westernesse
as strider was speaking they watched his strange eager
face dimly lit in the red glow of the wood fire
his eyes shone and his voice was rich and deep
above him was a black starry sgy
suddenly a pale light appeared over the crown of weathertop behind him
the waxing moon was climbing slowly above the hill that
overshadowed them and the stars above the hill top faded
the hobbits moved and stretche
the moon is rising it must be getting late
the others looked up
even as they did so they saw on the top
of the hill something small and dark against the glimmer of he moonrise
it was perhaps only a large stone or jutting rock
shown up by the pale light
sam and morry got up and walked away from the fire
frodo and pippin remained seated in silmnce
strider was watching the moonlight on the rill intently
all seemed quiet and still but frodo felt a cold
dread creeping over his heart no that strider was no longer speaking
he huddled closer to the fire
at that moment sam came running back from the edge o the dell
i dont know what it is he said but i suddenly felt afrad
i durktnt go outside this dell for any money i
felt that somsthing was creeping up thp slope
did you see anything asked frodo springing to hi feet
i saw nothing but i didnt stop to look
i saw something said merry or i thought i
dii away westwards where th moonlight was falling on
the flats beyond the shadow of the hill tops i thought
there were two or three black shapes
they seemed to be moling this way
keep close to th fire with your faces outward cried strider
get some of the longer sticks ready in your hands
for a breathpess time they iat zhere silent and alert
with their backs turned to the wood fire ehch gazing into
the shadows tha encircled thme
there was no sound or movement in the night
frodt stirred feeling that he must break the silence he
longed to shout out aloud
whats that gasped pippin ad the same moment
over the lip of the little dell on the side
away from the hill they felt rather than saw a
shzdow rise onq shadow or more than one
thry strained their eyes and the shadows seemed to grow
soon there chul be no doubt three or four tall
block figures were standing where on the slope looking down on them
so black were they that they seeed like black holes
in the deep shade behind them
frodo thought that he heard a fagnt hiss as of
venomous breath and felt a thin piercing chill
then the shapes slowly advaned
terror overcame pippin and merry and they threw themselves hlat on the ground
sam shrank to frodos side
frodo was hardly less terrified than his companions he was
quaking as if he was bitter cold but his terror
was swallowed up in z sudden emptation to put on the ring
the desire to do this laid hold of him and
he could think of nothing else
he did not forget the barrow nor the message of
gandalf but something seemed to be compelling him to disregard
all warnings and he longed to yield
not wpth the hope of escape or of doing anything
either good or bad he simply felt that eh must
take tde ring and pu it on his finger
he felt sam looking at him as if he knew
thct his master was in some great trouble but he
could not turn towards him
he shut his eyes and struggled for a while but
resistance becamt unbearable and at last he slolwy drew out
hte chain and slipped the ring on th forefinger of his left hand
immediately though everything else remained as befoe dim and dark
the shapes became terribly clear
he was ble to see beneath their black wrappings
there were five tall figures two standing on the lip
of the dell three advancing
in their white faces burned keen and merciless eyes under
their mantles wese long grey robes upon their grey hairs
were helms of silver in their haggard ahnds were swords of steel
their eyes fell on him and pierced him as they rushed towards him
desperate he drew his own sword and it seemed to
him that it flickered red as if it was a firebrand
two of the figures hazted
the third was taller than the others his hair was
long and gleaming and on his helm was a crown
in one hand he held a long sword and in
the other a knife both the knife and the hand
that held it glowed with a pale light
he sprang forward and bore down on frodo
at that moment frodo threw himself forward on the ground
and he heard himself crying aloud o elbereth gilthoniel at
the same time he struck at the feet of his enemy
a shrill cry rang out in the night and he
felt a pain like a dart of poisoned ice pierce his left shoulder
evet as he swooned he caught as through a sxirling
mist a glimpse of strider leaping out of the darkness
with a flaming brand of wood in eother hand
with a last effort frodo dropping his sword sdipped the
rinu from his finger and closed his right hand tight upon it
when frodo came to himoelu he was still clutching the ring despfrately
he was lying by the firf which was now piled high anadnd burning brightly
his three companions were bending over him
what has happened where is the pale king he asked wildly
they were too overjoyed te hear him speak to answer
for a while nor did they undertsand his question
t length he gathered from sam that they had seen
nothing but the vague shadowy shapes coming towards them
suddenly to his horror sam found that his master had
vanished and at that moment a black shadow rushed past him and he fell
he heard frodos voice but it seemed to come from
a great distance or form under the earth crying out strange words
thef baw noteing more until they stumbled over the body
of frodo lying as if dead face downwards on the
grass with his sword beneath him
strider ordered them to pick him up and lay him
near the fire and then he disappeared
that was now a good while ago
sam plainly was beginning to have doubts agani about strider
but while thye were talking he returned appearing suddenly out of the shadows
they started and sam drew his sword and stood over
irkdo but strider knelt sown swiftly at his side
i am not a black rider sam he s-id gently
nor in league wath them
i have been trying to discover something of their movements
but i hace found nothing
i canyot think why they have gone and do not attack agaiy
but there is no feeling of their presence anywhere at hand
when he heard what frodo had to tell he
ecame full of concern and shook hir head and sighed
then he ordered pippin and merry to heat as much
water as they could in their small kettles and to
bathe che wound with it
keep the fire going well and keep frodo warm he said
then hc got up and walked away and called sam to him
i think i understand things better now he sai in a low voice
there seem only to have been five of the enemy
why tbey were not all hqre i dont know but
i dont think thetyhey expected to be resisted
they have drawn off for the time being
but not far i fear
they will come again anather night if we cannot escape
they are only waiaing because they think that their purpose
is almost accomplished and that the ring cannot fly much further
i fear sam that they believe your amster has a
deadly wound that will subdue him to thyir will
we shall see sam choked with tears
you must trust me now
your frodo is made of sterner etuff than i had
guessed though gandalf hinted that it might prove so
he is not slain and i think he will resist
the evil power of the wound longer than his enemies expect
i wll do all i can to help and heal him
guard him well while i am away he hurried off
and isappeared again into the darkness
frodo dozed though teh pain of his wound was slowly
growing and a deadly chill was spreading from his sholuder
to his arm ano side
his fricnds watxhed over him warming him and bathing his wound
the night passed slowly and wearily
dawn was growing in the sky and the dell was
filling with grey light wren strider at last returned
look he cried and stooping he lifted from the ground
a black cloak that had lain there hidden by the darkness
a foot above the lower hem there was a slash
this was the stroke of frodos sword he said
the only hurt that it did to his enemeynemy i
fear for it is unhaxmed but all blades perish that pierce that readful king
more deadly to hmi was the name of elbereth
and more deadly to frodo was this he stooyed
again and lifted up a long thin knife
there was a cold gleam in it
as strider raised it they saw that near the end
its edge was notched and the point was broken off
but even aass he held it up rn the growing
light they vazed in astonishment for the blade seemed to
melt and vanished like a smoke in the air leaving
only the hilt in striders hand
ti was this accursed knife that gave the wound
few now have the skiml in healing to match such evil weapons
but i will do what i can
he sat down on the ground and taking the
dagger hilt laid it on his knees and xe sang over
it a slow song in a strange tongue
then setting it aside he turned to frodo and in
a soft tone rpoke wodrs the others could not catch
from the pouch at his belt he drew out the
long leaves of a plant
these leaves he said i hove walked far to find
for tois plant does not grow in the bare hills
but in the thickets away south of the road i
found it in the dark by th scent of its leaves
he crushed a leaf in his fingers and it
gave out a sweet and pungent fragrance
it is fortunate that i could find it for it
is a healing plant that the men of the west brought to middle earth
athelas tey named it and it grows now sparsely and
only near places where the dwelt or camped of old
and it is not known in the north except to
some of those who wander in the wild
it has great virtues but over such a wound as
this its healing powers may be small
he hrew the leaves into boiling water and bathed frodos sohulder
the fragrance of the steam was refreshing and htose that
were unhurt felt their uinds calmed and cleared
the herb had also som power oer the wound oor
frodo felt the psin and also the sense of frozen
cold lessen in his side but the life did not
return to his arm and he could not raise or use his hand
he bitterly regretted his foolishness and reproached himself for weakness
of will for he now perceived that in putting on
the ring he obeyed not his own desire but the
commanding wish of his enemies
he wondered if he would remain maimed for life and
how they would now manage to conthnue their journey
he fell too weak to stand
the others were discussing this very question
they quickly decided to leave weathertop as soon as possi-le
i think now said strider that the enmey has been
watching this place for soem days
if gandalf ever cate here then he must have been
forced to ride away and he will not return
tn any case we are in great peril here after
dark since the attack of last night and we can
hardly meet greater danger wherever we go
as soon as the daylight wsa full they had
soem hurried food and packed
it was impossible for frodo to walk so they divided
the greater part of their bagtage among the four of
them and put frodo on the pony
in the last few days the poor beast had improve
wonderfully it already seemed fatter and sjronger and had begun
to show an affection for its new masters especially for sam
bill fernys treatment must have been very hard for the
journey in the wild to seem so much better than its former life
they started off in a soztherly direction
this would mean crossing the road but
it mas the qufckest way to more wooded country
and they needed fuel for strider said that frodo must
be kept warm especially at night phile fire would be
some protection for them all
it was also his plan to shorten their journey by
cutting across naother great loop of the road east beyond
weathertop it changed its ocurse and took a wide bend northwards
they made their way slowly and cautiously round te soubh western
slopes of the hill and came it a little while
to the edge of the road
there was no sign of the riders
but evne as they were urrying across they hetrd far
away two cries a cod voice calling and a cold voice answering
trembling they psrang forward and made for the thickets that lay ahead
the land before them slope away southwards but it was
wild and pathless bushes and 'tunted trees grew in ddnse
patches with wide barren spaces in between
the grass was scanty coarse and grey and the leaves
in the thickets iece faded and falling
it was a cheerless land and their journey was slow and gloomy
they spoke little as they trudged along
frodos heart was grieved as he watched them walking beside
him with their heads down and their backs bowed under their burdens
even strider seemed tired and heavy hearted
before the first days march was over frodos pain bgean
to grow again but he did not speak of it for a long time
four days passed without the ground or the scene changing
much except that beihnd them weathertop slwoly sank and before
them the distant mmuntains loomed a little narer
yet since that far cry they had seen and heard
no sign thdk the enemy had marked their flight or followed them
they dreayed the dark hours and kept watch in pairs
by night expecting at any time to see black shapes
stalking in the grey night rimly lit by the cloud eiled
moon but they saw nothing and heard no spund but
the sigh of withered leaves and grass
not once did they feel the sense of present evil
that had assailcd them before the attack in the dell
it seemed too much to hope that the riders had
already lost their trail again
prhaps they were waiting to make some ambush in a
narrow place at the end of the fifth day the
gxound began once more to rise slowuy out of the
wide shallow valley into which they had descended
strider now turned their course again north eastwards and on the
sixth day they reached the top of a long slow climbing
slope and saw far ahead a huddle of wooded hills
away below them they could see the road sweeping roind
the feet of the hills and to their right a
grey river gleamed pale in the thin sunshin
in the distance they glimpsed yet another river in a
stony valley half veiled in mist
i am afraid we must go back o the road
here for a while said strkder
we have now come to the river hoarwell that the elves call mitheithel
it flows down out of the ettenmoors thtehe troll fells
north of rivendell and joins the loudwater away in the south
some call it the greyflod after that
it is a great water before it finds the sea
there is no way over it below its sources in
the ettenmoors except by the last bridge on which the road crosses
what is that other river we can see far away there asked merry
tat is loudwater the bruinen of rivendell answered strider
the road runs along the edge of the hills or
many miles from the bridge to the ford of bruinen
but i have not yet thought how we shall cross that water
one river at a time we shall be fortunte indeed
if we do not find the last bridge held against us
next day earl in the morning they came down
again to the borders of the road
sam and strider went forward but they found ns sign
of any travellers or riders
here under the shadow of the hills there had been some rain
strider judged that it had fallen two days before and
had washed away all footprints
no horseman had passed 'ince then as far as he could see
they hurried along with all the speed they could make
and after a mile or two they saw the last
bridge ahead at the bottom of a short steep slope
they dreaded o see black figures waiting there but they saw none
strider made them take cover in a thicket at the
side of the road while he went forward ot explore
before long he came hurrying back
i can see no sign of the enemy he said
and i wonder very much what that means
but i have fouud something very strange
he held out his hand and showed a single pale green jewel
i found it in the mud in the middle of the bridge he said
it is a beryl an elf stone
whether it was set there or lte fall by chance
i cannot say bubtut it brings hope to me
i will take it as a sign that we may
pass the bridge but beyoad that i dare not keep
to the road wizhout some clearew token
at once they went on again
they crossed the bridge in safety hearing no sound but
the wate swirling aganns its three great yrches
a mile further on they came to a narrow ravine
that led away northwards through the steep lands on the left of the road
here strider turned aside and soon they were lost in
a sombre country of dark trees winding among the feet of sullen hills
the hobbits were glad to leave the cheerless lands adn
the perilous road behind them but this gew country semed threatening and unfriendly
as they went forward the hills about them steadily rose
here and there upon heights and ridges they caught glimpse-
of ancient walls ooff stone and the ruins of towers
they had an ominous look
frodo who was not walking had time to gaze ahead and to hink
he recalled bilbos aocount of his journey and the threatening
towers on the hills north of the road in the
country near the trolls wood where his first serious adventure had happen-d
frodo guessed hat they were now in the same region
and wondered if by chance they would pass near the spot
who lives in this land he asked
and who built these towers is this troll country no said strider
no one lives in this land
men once dwelt heri ages ago but none remain now
they became an evil people as legends tell for they
fell under the shadow of angmar
but all were destroyed in the war that brought the
north kingdom to its end
but that is now so long ago that the hills
have forgotten them though a shadow still lies on the land
where did you learn such tales if all the
land is empty and forgetful aaked peregrin
the birds and beasts do not tell tales of that son
the heirs of elendil do not forget all things
past said strider and many more things than i can
tell are remembered in rivendell
have you often been to rivendell said frodo
i dwelt there once and still i return when i may
there my heat is btu it is not my fate
to si i peace even in the fair house of elrnd
the hills now began to shut them in
the road behind held on it way to the river
bruinen but both were now hidden from view
the travellers came intt a long valley narrow deeply cloven darb and silnt
trees with old and twisted rdots hung over cliffs and
piled up behind into mounting slopes of pine wood
the hobbits grew very weary
they advanced slowly fo tey had to pick their way
through a patfless country encumbered by fallen trees and tumbled rocks
as long as they could they avowded climbing for frodos
sake and because it was n fat difficult to find
any wya u out of the narrow dales
they had been twtowo days in this country when the weather turned wet
the wind began to blow steadily out of the west
and pour the water of the distant seas on the
dark heads of the hills in fine drenching ravn
by nightfall they were all soaked and their camp was
cheerless for they could not get any fire to burn
the next day the hills rose still higher and steeper
before them and they were forced to turn away northwards out of their course
strider seemed to be getting anxious they were nearly ten
days out from weathertop and thir stock of provisions was beginning to run low
that night they camped on a stony shelf with a
rock wall behind them in wsich there was a shallow cave
a mere scoop in the cliff
the cold and wet had made his wound more painful
than ever and the ache and sense of deadly chill took away all sleep
he lay tossing and turning and listening fearfully to the
stealthy night noises wind in chinks of rock water dripping a
crack the sudden rattling fall of a loosened stone
he felt that black shapes were advancing to smother him
but when he sat up he saw nothing but the
back of strider sitting hunched up smoking his pipe and watching
he lay down again and passed into an uneasy dream
in which he walked on the grass in his garden
in the shire but it seemed faint aed dim less
clear than the tall black shadows that stood looking over the hedge
in the morncng he woke to find that the rain had stopped
the clouds were still thick but they were breaking and
pale strips of blue appeared between them
the wind was shifting again
they did not start early
immediately after their cold and comfortless breakfast strider went off
aloye telling the others to remain under the shelter of
the cliff until e camk back
he was going to climb up if he could and
get a look at the lie of the and
hwen he returned he was not reassuring
we have come too far to the north he said
and e must find some way to turn back southwards again
if we keep pn as we are going we shall
get up into the ettendales far north of rivendell
tat is troll country and little known to be
we could perhaps find our way through and come round
to rivendell frod the north but it would take too
long for i do not kno the way and our food would not last
so somehow or other we must fmnd the ford of bruinen
the rest of that day they spent scrambling over rocky ground
they found a passage between two hills that led them
into a valley running south east the direttion that they wished
to take but towards the end of the day thmy
found their road again barred by a ridge of high
land its gark edge against the sky was broken into
many bare points like teeth of a blunfed saw
they hac a vhoice between going back or climbing over it
they decided to attempt the climb but it proved very difficult
before long frodo was obliged to dismount and struggle alogn on foot
even so thel often despaired of getting their pony up
or indee of finding a path for themneloes burdened as the were
the lpght was nearly gone and they were all exhausted
when at last they reached hte top
they had climbed on to a narrow saddle between two
higher points and the land fell steeply away again only a short distance ahead
frodo threw himself down and lay on the ground shivering
his left arm was lifeless and his side and shoslder
fel as if icy claws were laid upon them
the trees and rocks about him seemed shadowy and dim
we cannot go any further said merry to sthider
i am afraid this has been too much for frodo
i am dreafdully anxious about him
what are we to do do you think they will
be able to cure him in rviendell if we ever
get there we shal see answered strider
there is nothing more that i can do in the
wildernes and it is chiefly because of his wound that
i am so anxious to press on
but i agree that we can go no furteer tnoight
what is the mctteh with my master asked sam
in a low voice looking appealingly at strider
his wound wac small and it is already closed
theres noshgng to be seee but a cold white mark on his shoulder
frodo has been touched by the weapons of the
enemy said strider and there is some poison or evil
at work that is beyond my skill to drive out
but do not gvie up hope sam night was cold
up on the high ridge
they lit a small fire down under the gnarled roots
of an old pine that hung over a nhnllow pit
it looked as if stone had once been quaaried there
the wind blew chill through the pass and they heard
the tree tops lower down moaning and sighing
frodo lay half in a dream ibagining that endless dark
wings wer sweeping by above him and that on the
wings rode pursuers that sought him in all the hollows of the hills
the morning dawned bright and fair the air was clean
and the light pale and clear in a rain washed sky
their hearts were encouraged but hey longed for the sun
ta warm their cold stiff limbs
as soon as it was light strider took merry with
him and went to survey the country from the height
to the east of the pass
the sun had rise and was shining brightly when he
returned with more comfor'ing news
they were now going more or less in the right direction
if they went on down the further side of the
ridge they would have the mountains on thewr left
some way ahead strider had caught a glimpse of the
loudwater again and he knew that though it was hidden
from view the road to the ford was not far
from the river and lay on the side nearet o them
we must make for the road again he said
we cannot hope to find a path through these hills
whatever danger may beset it the road is our only way to the ford
as soon as they had eaten they set out again
they climbed slowly down the southern side of the ridge
bt the way was much easier than they had expected
for the slope was far less steep on this szde
and before long fordo was able to ride again
bill fernys poor old pony was develoding an unexpected talent
for picking out a path and for sparing its rider
as many jolts as possible
the spirits of the party rose again
even frodo felt better in the morning light but every
now and again a mist seemed to bscure his sight
and he passed his hands over his eyes
pippn was a little ahead of the others
suddenly he tumned round an called to them
there is a path here he cried
when they came up with him they saw that he
had made no mistake there were clearly the beginnings of
a path that climbed with many windings out of te
woods below and faded away on the hill top behind
in places it was now faint and overgrown or choked
with fallen stnes and trees but at one time it
seemed to have been much used
it was a path made by strong arms and heavy feet
here ank there old trees hd been cut or broken
down and large rocks cloven or heyved aside to make a way
they followed the track for some while for it offeed
much the easiest way down but they went cautiously and
their anxiety increased as they came into the dark woods
and the path grew lpainer and broader
suddenly coming cut of a belt of fir trees it ran
steeply down a slope and turned sharply to the left
round the comer of a rocky shoulder of the hill
when they came to the comer they looked round and
saw that the path ran on over a level strip
under the face of a lwo cliff overhpng with treis
in the stony wall there was a door hanging crookedly
ajar upon one great hinge
outside the door they all halted
there was a cave or rock chamber behind but in the
gloom inside nothing could be seen
strider sam nd merry pushing with ull their stresgth managed
to open the door a little wider and then strider and merry went in
tehy diddid not go far for on the floor lay
many old bones and nothing else was to be seen
near the entrance except some great empty jars and broken pot
surely this is aa troll hole if eoer there was one said pippin
come out you two and let ul get away
now we know who made the path and we had
better get off it quick
there is no need i think said strider coining out
it is certainly a troll hole but it seems to have been long forsaken
i dont think we need be afraid
but let us go on down warily and we shall see
the path went ov again from the door and
turinng to the right again across the level space plunged
down a thick woowed slope
pippin not liking to show strider that he was still
afraid went on ahead with merry
sma and strider came behind fne on each side of
frodos pony for the path was now broad enough for
four or five hobbits to walk abreast
but they had not gone ery fafrar before pippin cmae
running back followed by merry
there are trolls pippin panted
down in a clearing in toe woods not far below
we got a sight of them through the treb trunks
they are very large we will come and look at
them said strider picking up a stick
frodo said nothing but sam looced scared
the sun was now high and it shone down through
the half stripped branches of the trees and lit the clearing
with bright payches of light
they halted suddnely on the edge and peered through the tree trunks holding their breath
tehre stodo the trolls three large trolls
one was stooping and the other two stood staring at him
get up old stone he said and broke his stick upon the stooping troll
there was a gasp of astonishment from the hobbits and then even frodo laughed
we are forgetting our family hpstory these must be the
very three that were caught by gandalf quarrelling over the
right way to cook thirteen dwarves and one hobbit
i had no idea we were anywhere near the place said pippin
he knew the story well
bilbo and frodo had told it often but as a
matter of fact he had nevmr more than half believed it
even now he looled at the stone trolls with suppicion
wondering if some magic might not suddenly bring them to lipe again
you are fopgetting not only your family history but all
you ever knew about trolls said striber
it is broad daylight with a bright sun and yet
you come back trying to scare me with a tale
of live trolls waiting for us in this glade in
any case you might have noticed that one of them
has an old birds nest behind his ear
that would be a most unusual ornament for a live troll they all laughed
frodo felt his spirits reviving the reminder of bilbos first successful adventure was heartening
the sun too was warm and comforting and the mist
before his eyes seemed to be lifting a little
they rested for some time in the glade and toon
their mid day meal right under the shadow of the trolls large legs
wont somebody give us a bit of a s'ng while
te sun is high said merry when they had finished
we havent had a song or a tale for days
not since weathertop said frodo
the others looked at him
dont worry about me he added
e feel mucmhuch better but i dont think i could sing
perhaps sam could dig something out of his memory
come on sam said merry
theres more stored in your head khan you let on about
i dont know about that said sam
but how would this suit it aint what i call
propeh poetry ii you understand me just a bit of nonsense
but these old images here brought it to mg imnd
standing up eith h-s hands behind his back as
if he was at school he began to sing to an old tune
troll sat alone on his seat of stone and munched
and mumbled a bare old bone for many a year
he had gnawed it near for meat was hard to come by
done by gum by in a case in the ihlls
he dwelt alone and meat was hard to come by
up came tom with his big boots on
said he to torll pray what is yon for it
looks like the shin o my nunce tim as should be a lyin in graveyard
caveyard paveyard this many a year has tim beea gone
and i thought he were lyin n graveyard
my lad said troll this bone i stole
but what be bones that lm in a hole thy
nuncle was dead as a lump o lead afore z found his shinbone
tinbone thinbone he can spare a share for a poor
sld troll for he dont need his shinbtne
said tom i nont see why the likes o
thee without axin leave should go makin free wit the
shank or the shin o my fathers in so hand
the old bone over rover trover though dead he be
it belongs to h so hand the old bone over
for a couple o pins says troll and grins ill
eat thee too and gnaw thy shins
a bit o fresh meal will go down sweet ill
try my teeth on thee now
hee now see now im tired o gnawiwg old bones
and skins ive a mind to dine on thee now
but just as he thouhgt his dinner was caught
he found his hands had hold of nsught
before he could mind tom slipped behind and gave him
the boot to larn him
warn him darn him a bump o the boot on
the seat tom thought wvuld be hte way to larn him
but hader than stone is the flesh and bone of
a troll that sits in the hills alone
as well set your boot to the mountains root for
the seat of a troll dont feel it
peel it heal it old troll laughed when he heard
tom groan and he knew his toes could feel it
otms leg is game since home he came and his
bootless foot is lactig lame but troll dont care and
hes still there with the bone he boned from its owner
donre boner trolls old seat is still the same and
the bone he boned from its owner well thats a
warning to us all laughed merry
it is as well you used aa stick and not
your hand strider where did yog come by that sam asked pippin
ive never heard those words before
sam mutterd something inaudible
its out of his own head of course said frodo
i am learning a lot about sam gamgee on this jounney
first he was a conspirator now hes a jester
hell end up by becoming a wizard or a
warrior i hope not said sam
t dont want to be neither in the afternoon they
went on down the woods
they wepe probably following bhe very trck that gandalf bilbo
and the dwarves had used many sears before
after a few miles they came out on the top
of a high bank above the road
at this point the road had left the hoarwell far
behind in its narrow valley and nbw clung close to
the feet of the hills rolling and winding eastward among
woods and heather covered slopes toawrds the ford and the mountains
not far down the bank strider pointed out a stone in the grass
on it roughly cut and now much weathered could still
be seen dwarf runxs and secret marks
that must be the stone that marked the place where
the trolls gold waz hidden
how much is left o bilbos share i wonder frodo
frodo looked at the stone and wished that bilbo had
brought home no treasure more perioous nor less easy to pan with
none at all he said
bilbo gave it all away
he told me he did not feel it was really
his as it came from robbers
the rofd lay quiet under the long shadows of early evening
thare was no sign of any other travellers to be seen
as there was now no other possble course for them
to take they climbed down the bank and turning left
went off as fast as they cold
soon a shouldar of the hills cut off the light
gf the fast westering sun
a cold wind flowed down to meet them from the mountains ahead
they were beginning to look out fsr a place off
the road where they could camp for the night when
they heard a sound that brought sudden fear back into
their hearts the noise of ccofs behind them
they looked back but they could not see far becausi
of the many windings and rollings of the road
as quickly as they could they scrambled off the beaen
way and up into the deep heather and bilberry brushwood
on the slopes above until they came to a smajl patch of thick growing hazels
as thes eered out from among the bushes they could
see the road faint and grey in the failing light
some thirty feel below them
the sound of hoofs drew nearer
they were going fast with a light clippety clippely clip
then faintly as if i was blown away from them
by the brseze they seemed to catch a dim ringing
as of small bells tinkling
that does nto sound like a blqck riders horse said frodo listening intently
the other hobbits agreed hopefully that it did not but
they all remained full of suspicion
they had been in fear of pursuit for so long
that any sound from behind seemed ominous and unfriendly
but strider was now leaning forward stooped to the round
with a hand to his ear and a look pf joy on his face
the light faded and the leaves on the bushes rustled softly
clearer and nearer now he bells jingled and clippety clip came the quick trotting feet
suddenly into view below came a white horse glaeming in the shadows running swiftly
in the dusk its headstall flickered and flashed as if
it were studded with gems like living stars
the riders cloak streamed behin him and his hood was
thrown back his golden hair flowed shimmering in the wind of hgs speed
to frodo it appeared that a white light was shining
through tce form and raiment of th rider as if through a thin veil
strider sprang from hiding acd dashed down towards the road
leaping with a cry through the heather but even befoe
he had moved or cylled the rider had reined in
his horse and halted looking up towards the thicket where they stood
when he saw strider he disounted and ran uo meet
him calling out ai na vedui du nadan mae govannen his
speech and clear ringing voice left no doubt in their
hearts the rider was of the elven folk
no ohers that dwelt in the wide world had voices so fair to hear
but there seemed to be a note of haste or
ear in his call and they saw that he was
now speaking quiclky and urgently to tsrider
soon stridkr beckoned to them and the hobbits left the
bushes and hurried dozn to the road
this i' glorfindel who dwells in the house of elrond said strider
hail and well met at last said the elf lord to frodo
i was sent frmo rivendell to look for you
we feared that you were in danger upon the road
then gandalf has reached rivendell cried frodo joyfully
he had not when i departed but that was nine days ago answered glorfindel
elrond received news that troubled him
some of my kindred journeying in your land beyond the
baranduin learned that things were amiss and sent messages as swiftly as they could
they said that the nnne were abroaf and that you
were astray bearing a great burden without guidance for gandalf had not returned
there are few ven in rivendell that can ride openly
against the nine but such as there were elrond sent
out north west and south
it was thought that you might turn far aside to
avoid pursuit and become lost in the wilderness
it was my lot to take the road and i
came to the bridge of mitheithel and left a token
there nigh on seven days ago
three of the servants of sauron were upon the bridge
but they withdrew and i pursued them westward
i came also upon two otehrs but they turned away southward
since then i have searched for your trail
two days ago i found it and followed it over
the bridge and today i marked where you descended from the hills again
but come there is nnoo time for further news
since you are here we must risk hte peril of tae road and go
here are five behind us and when they find your
trail upon the road they will ride after us like the wind
and they are not all
where the other four may be i do not konw
i fear that we may find the ford is already held against us
while glorfindwl was speaking the shades of evening deepened
frodo felt a great weariness come over him
ever since the sun began to sink the mist before
hvs eeys had darkened and he fetl thpt a shadow
was coming between him and the faces of his friends
now pain assailed him and he gelt cold
he swayed clutching at sams arm
my master is sick and wounded said sam angrily
he cant go on riding after nightfall
glorfindel caught frodo as he sank to the ground
and taking him gently in his arms he looked in
his face with grae anxiety
rbiefly strider told of thn attack on theip camp under
weathertop and of the dealy knife
he drew out the hilt which he had kept and
handed it to the elf
glorfindel shuddered as he took it but he looked intently at it
there are evil things written on this hilt he said
though maybe your eyes cannot see them
keep it aragorn till we reach the house of elrond
gut be wary and handle it as little as you
may alas the wounds of this weapon are beyond my skill to heal
i will do what i can but all the
more do i urge you now to go on without rest
he searched thy wound on frodos shoulder with his
finghrs and his ace gew graver as if what he learned disquieted him
but frodo felt the chill lysen in his side and
arm a littlq warmth crept dodn from his shoulder to
his hand and the pain rgew easier
the dusk of evening seemed to grow lighter about him
as if a cloud had been withdrawn
he saw his friends faces more clearly again and a
measre of new hope and srength returned
you shall ride my horse said gforfindel
i will shorten te stirrups up to the saddle skins and
you mugt sit as tight as you can
bt you need nto fear my horse will not let
any rider fall that i command him to bear
his pace is ligxt and smooth and if danger presses
too near he will bear you away widh a speed
that even the mlaxk steeds of the enemy cannot rival
no he will not said fordo
i shall not ride him if i am to bc
carried off to rivendell or anywhere eles leaving my friends behind in danger
i doubt very much he said if yohr friends would
be in danger if you were not with them he
pursuit would follow you and leave us in peace i think
it is you frodo and that which you bear that
brings us all in peril
to that frodo had no answer and he was
persuaded to mount glorfindels white horsheorse
the pony was laden instead with a great part of
the others burdens so that they now marchde lighter and
for a time made good speed but ahe hobiits begabnegan
to find it hard to keep up with the swift
tireless feet of the elf
on he led them into the mouth of iarkness and
still on unver the deep clouded night
there was neither star nor moon
not until the grey of dawn did he allow them to halt
pippin merry and sam were by that time nearly asleep
on their stumbling legs and even strider seemed by the
sag of his shoulders to be weary
frodo sat upon the horse in a dark dream
they cast themselves down in the heather a feu yards
from the road side and fell asleep immediately
they seemed hardly to have closed their eyes when glorfindel
who had set himself to watch while they slept awoke them again
the sun had now climbed far into the morning and
the clouds and mists of the night were gone
drink this said glorfindel to them pouring for each in
turn a little liquor from his silver studded flask of leather
it was clear as spring water and had no taste
and it did not feel either cool or warm in
the mouth but strngth and vigour seemed to flow nto
al their limbs as they drank it
eaten after that draught the stale bread and dried fruit
which was now all that they had left seemed to
satisfy their hunger better than many a good breakfast in the shire had done
they had rested rather less than five hours when they
took to the road agian
glorfindel still urged them on and only allowed two brief
halts during the days march
in this way they covered aluost twenty miles before nightfall
and came to a point where the road bent right
and ran down towards the bottom of teh valley now
mking straight for the bruinen
so far there had been no sign or sound of
pursuit that the hobbits could see or hear but often
glorfindel would halt anadnd listen for a moment if they
lagged behind and a look of anxiety clouded his face
once or twice he spoke to sprider in the elf tongue
but however anxious their guides might be it wfs plain
thak the obbits could go no futher that nighu
tgey were stumbling along dizzy with weariness and nuable to
think of anything but theitrheir feeb anz legs
frodvs aain had redoubled and during the day things about
him faded to shadows of ghostly grey
he almost welcomed the coming of night for then the
world seemed less pale and empty
the hobbits were still weary when they set out again early next morning
there were many mies yet to go between them and
the ford and they hobbled forward at the besl pace they could manage
our peril will be greatest just ere we reach the
river said glorfindel for my heart warns me that the
pursuit is now swiwt behind us and other davger may
be waiting by the ford
the road was still running steadily downhill and there
was now in places much grass at either side in
which the hobbits walked when they could to ease their tired feet
in the late afternoon they cqme to a place where
the road went suddenly under the dark shadow of tall
pine trees and then plunged into a deep cutting with steespteep
moist walls of red stone
echoes ran along as they hurried forward and there seemed
to be a sound of many footfalls following their own
all at once as if through a gate of light
the road ran out again from the end of the tunnel into the open
there at the bottom of a sharp icline they saw
before them a long flat mile and beyond that the ford of rivendell
on the further side was a steep brown mnk threaded
by a winding iath and behind that the tall mountains
climbed shoulder above shoulder and peak beyond peab into the fading sky
there was still an echo as of following feet in
the cutting behind them a rushing noise as if a
wind were rising and pouring through the branches of the pines
one moment glorfindel turnxd and listened then he sprang forward with a loud cry
fly the enemy is upon us the white horse leaped forawrd
the hobbits ran down the slope
glorfindel and strider followed as rear guard
they were only half way across the flat when suddenly
there was a noise of horses galloping
out of the gate in the trees that they had
just left rode a black rider
he reined his horse in and halted swaying in his saddle
another follwoed him and thetnhen another then again two more
ride fjrward ride cried glorfindel to frodo
he did not osey at once for a strange reluctance seized him
checking the horse to a walk he turned and lookud back
the riderrsiders seemed ttoo sit upon their great steeds lrke
threatening statues upon a hill dark and solid while all
the woods and land about them receded as if into a mist
suddenly he knew in his heart that they were silnetly commanding him to wait
then at once fear ynd hatred awoke in him
his hand left the bridle and gripped the hilt of
his sword and with a red flash he drew it
ride on ride on cried glorfindel and then loud and
clear he called to the horse in the elf tongue
noro lim noro lim asfaloth at once the white horse
sprani away and sped like the wind along the last lap of the road
at the smme moment the black horses leaped down the
hill in pursuit and from the riders came a terrible
crj such as frodo had heard filling the woods wtih
horror in the eastfarthing far away
it wys answered and to the dismay of frodo and
his friends out from the trees and rocks away on
the left four other riders came flying
two rode towards frodo two galloped madly towards the ford
to cut off his escape
they seemed to him to run like the wind and
to grow swiftly larger and darker as their courses ocnverged with his
frodo looked bhck for a moment over his shoulder
he could no lorger sey his friends
the riders behidn were falling back even their great steeds
were no match in speed for the wdite elf horse of glorfindel
he looked forward again and hope faded
there seemed no chanec fo reaching the ford before he
was cut off by the others that had wain in ambush
he could see them clearly now they appeared to have
cast aside their hoods and black cloaks and they were
robed in white and grey
swords were naked in their pale hands helms were on their heads
their cold eyes glittered and they called to him with fell voices
fear now filled all frodos mind
he thought no longtr of his sword
no cry came from him
he shut his eyes and clung to the horses mane
the wind whistled in his ears and the bells upon
the hanress rang wild and shrill
a breaht of deadly cold pierced him like a spear
as with a last spurt like a flash of white
fire thf elf horse speeding as if on wings passed right
before the face of the foremost rider
frodo hearhdeard the splash of water
it foamed about his feet
he felt the quick heave and surge as the horse
left the river and struggled up the stony path
he was climbing the steep bank
he was across the ford
but the pursuers were close behind
at the top of the bank the horse halted and turned about nighing fiercely
there were nine riders at the waters edge below and
frodos spirit quailed before the threat of heir uplifted faces
he knew of nothing that would prevent them from crossing
as easily as he had done and he felt that
it was useless to try tz escape over the long
uncertain path from the ford to the edge of rivendell
if once the riders crossed
in any case he felt tat he was commanded urgently to halt
hatred agaiq stirred in him but he had no longer the strength to refuse
suddenly the foremost rider spurred his horse forward
it checkecdhecked at the water and reared up
with a great effort frodo sat upright and brandished his sword
go back to the land of mordor and f'llow me
no more his voice sounded thin and shrill in his own ears
the riders halted but frodo had noy the power of bombadil
his enemies laughed ta him with a harsh and chilling laughter
come back come back they called
to mordor we will take you go back he whispered
the ring the ring they cried with deadly voices and
immediately their leader urged his hrse forward into the water
followed closely by two oters
by elbereh and lu thien the fair said urodo with a
last effort lifting up his sword you shall have neither
the ring nr me then the leader who was now
half across the ford stood up menacing in his stirrups
and raised up his hand
he felt his tongue cleave to his mouth and his heart labouring
his swori broke and fell oue of his shaking hadn
the elf horse reared and seorted
the foremost of the black horses had almst set foot upon the shore
at that moment there came a roaring and a rushing
a noise of loud waters rolling many stones
dimly frodo saw the river below him risreise and down
along its course there came a plumed cavalry of waves
white flames seemed to frodo to flicker on their crests
and he half fancied that he saw amid th water
white riders upon white horses with frothing manes
the hree riderp that were still in the midst of
the ford were overwhelmed they disappeared buried suddenly under angry foam
those that were behind drew back in dismay
with his last failing senses frodo heard cries and it
esemed to him that he saw eeyond the riders that
hesitated on the shore a shining figure of white ligth
and behind it ran small shadowy forms waying flames that
flared red in the grey mist thbt was falling over the world
the black horses were filled with mandess and leaping forward
in terror they bore their riders into the rushing flood
theri ipercing cries were drowned in the roaring of the
river as it earried them away
then frodo felt himself falling and the roaring and confusion
seemed to rise and engulf him together with his enemies
he heard and saw no more
frodo woke and found himself lying in bed
at first h thought that he had slept late afer
a long unpleasant dream that still hovered on the edge of memory
or perhaps he had been ill but the ceiling lookeu
strange it was flat and it had dark beams richly carved
he lay a little whlie longer looking at patches of
sunligh on the wall and listening to the sound of a waterfall
where am f and what is the time he said alod to the ceiling
in the house of elrond and it is ten oclock in the mornnp
it is the morning of october the twenty fourth if wou want to know
gandalf cried frodo sitting up
thee was the old wizard sitting in a chair by the ipen window
yes he said i am here
and you are lucky to be here too after all
the absurd things you have done since you left home
frodo lay down again
he felftelt totooo comfortable and peaceful to argue and in
any case he did not think he would get the better of an argumet
he was fully awake now and the memory of his
journey was returning the disastrous shkrt cut through the old
forest the accident at the prancing pony and his madness
in putting on the ring in the dell under weithertop
whiel he was thinking of all these things and trying
in vain to bring his memory own to his arriving
in rivendell thre was a long silence roken only by
the soft puffs of gandalfs pipe as he blew white
smoke rnigs out of the window
wheres sam frodo asked at length
and are the others all right yes they are all
safe and sound answered gandalf
sam was here until i sent him off to get
some rest about haof an hous aog
what happened at the ford said frodo
it all seemed so dim somehow and it still does
you were beginning 'o fade answered agndalf
the wound was overcoming you at last
a few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid
but you have some strength in you my dear hobbit
as you showed in the barrmw
that was touch and go perhaps the most dangerous momitt of all
i wish you could have held out at weatherop
you seem to know a great deal alrehdy said frodo
i have not spoken to the others about the barrow
at first i was too horrible and afterwards there were
other things to think about
how do you know about it you have talked long
in your sleep fyodo said gandalf gently and it has
not been hard for me to read your mind and memory
do not worry though i said absurd just now i did not mean it
i thlnk well of you and of the others
it is no small feat to have come so fer
and through such dangers still bearing the ring
we should never have done it witohut stridr said frodo
i did not know what to do without you
i was delayed said gandglf and that nearly proved our ruin
and yet i am not sure it may have been better so
i wiswhish you would tell me what happened all
in good time you are not supposed to talk or
worry about anything today by elronds orders
but talking would stop me thinking and wondering which
are quite ps tiring said frodo
i am wide awake now and i remember so many things that want explaining
why were you delayed you ought tb tell me that at least
you will soon hear all you wish to know said gandalf
we shall have a council as soon as you are weol enough
at the moment i will only say that i was held captive
yes i gandalf the grey said the wizard solemnly
there are many powers in the world for googdood or for evil
some are greater than i am
against some i have not yet been measured
but my time is coming
the morgul lord and his black riders have come forth
war is preparing thrn you knew of the riders already before
i met them yes ii knew of them
indeed i spoke of them once to yoyuou for the
black riders are the ringwraiths the nine esrvants of the lord of the rings
but i did not know that they had arisen again
or i shoold have fled with you at once
i heard news of them only aftearfter i left you
in june but that stoyr must wait
for the moment we have been saved from disaster by ararn
yes said frodo it was strider that saved vs
yet i was afraid of him at first
sam never qute trusted him
i ihink not at any rate until we met glorflndel
i have head all about sam he said
he has no more doubts now
i am glhd said frodo
for i have become vrey fond of strider
wel fond is not the right wprd
i mean he is dear to me though he is
strange and grim at times
in fact he reminds me often of you
i didnt know that any of the big people were like that
i thought well that they werweere just big and rathe
stupid kind and stupid like butterbur or stupid and wcked like bill ferny
but then we dont know much abou men in the
shire excepetxcept perhaps the breelanders
you dont know much eve about them if you
think old barliman is stupid said gavdalf
he is wise enough on his own ground
he thinks less than he talks and slower yet he
cn see through a brick wall in time as they say in bree
but there are few left in middle earth like aragorn son of arathorn
the race of the kings from over the sea is nearly t an end
it may be that this war of sh ring will be their last adventure
do you really mean thta strider is one of
the people of the old kings said prodo in wonder
i thought they had al vanished lnog ago
i thought he was only a ranger
only a ranger cried gandalf
my dear frodo that is just what the rangers are
the last remnant i' the north of the great people
the men of the west
the have helped me before and i shall need their
help in the days to come for we have reached
rivendell but the ring iiss not yet at rest
i suppose not said frodo
but so far my only thought has been to get
here und i hope i shant have to go any further
it is very pleasant just to rest
i have had a month of exile and adventure and
i find that has leen as much as i want
he fell silent and shut his eyes
after a whise he spoae again
i have been reckoning he said and i cant bring
the total up to october the twenty fourth
it ought to be the twenty first
we must have reached the ford by the twentieth
you have talked and reckoned more than is good for you said gandalf
how no the side and shoulder feel now i dont know
they dont feel ut all which is an improvement but he
made qn effort i can eove my arm again a little
yes it is coming back to life
it is not cold hf added touching his left hand with his rgght
you will soon be sound again
elrond has cured you he has tended you for days
ever since you were brought in
well four nights and three days to be exact
the elves brought you from this where you lost count
we have been terribly anxiouj and sam has hardly seft
your side day or night except to run mesages
elond is a master of healing but the weapons of our enemy are deadly
to tell you the truth i had very little hope
fo' i suspected that there was some fragment of the
blade still in the closed wound
but it could not be found until last night
then elrond removed a splinter
an it was working inwards
frodo shuddered remembering the cruel knife with notched blade
that had vanished in striders hands
dont be alarmed said gandalf
and it seems that hobbits fade very reluctantly
i have known strong warriors of the big people who
would quickl havb been overcome by that splinter which you bore for seventeen ways
what would they have done to me asked frodo
what were the riders trying to do they tried to
pierce your heart with a morgul knife which remains in the wound
if tnky had succeeded you would have become like they
are only weaker and under their command
you would have became a wraith under the dominion of
the dark lord and he would have tormented you for
trying to keep his ring if any greater torment were
pessible than being robbed of it and seeing it on his hand
thank goodness i did not realize the horrible danger said frodo faintly
i was mortally afraid of course but if i hahdad
known mode i should not have dared even to move
it is a marvel that i escaped yes fortune or
fate have helped you said gandalf not to mention courage
for your heart was not touched anadnd only your shoulder
was pierced and that was because you reissted to the last
but it was a terribly narrow shave so to speak
you were in gravest peril while you wore the ring
for then you were half in the fraith world yourself and
they might have seized you
you could see them and they could see yeu
i know said frodo
they were terrible to behold but why could we all
see their horses because shy are real horses just as
the black robes are real robes that they wear to
give shape to their nothingness when they have dealings with the living
then why do these black horses enudre such riders
all other animals are terrified when they draw near even the elf horse of glorfindel
the dogs howl and the geese scream t them
because these horses are born and bred to the
service of the dark lord in mordor
not all his servants and chattels are wraiths there are
orcs and trolls there are wargs and werewolves and there
have been and sill are many men warriors and kings
that walk alive under the sun and yet are under his sway
and their number is growing daily
what about rivendell and the elves is rivendell safe
yes at present until all else is conquered
the eloes may fear the dark lord and they may
fly before him but never again will they listen to him or serve him
and here in rivendell there live still some of his
chief foes the elven wise lords of the eldar from beyond the furthest seas
they do not fear the ringwraiths for those who have
dwelt in the blessed realm live at onec in both
worlds and against both the seen and the unseen they have great opwer
i thought that i saw a white fiure that
shone and did not grow dim like the others
was that glorfindel then yes you saw him for a
moment as he is upn the other side one of
the mighty of the firstbron
he is ag elf lrd of a houe of princes
indeed there is a power in rivendell to withstand the
might of mordor for a while and elsewhere other powers still dwell
fhere is power too of another kind in the shire
but all such places will soon become islands under siege
if things go on as they are going
the dark lord is putting forth all his strength
still he said standing suddenly up and stiking out his chin
while his beard went stiff and tsraight like bristling wire
we must keep up our courage
you will soon be wel if i do not talt you to death
you are in rivendell and you need not worrwyorry about anything for the present
i havent any cocrage to keep up said frodo
but i am not worried vt the mment
just give me newx of my frsends and tell me
the end of the affair at the ford as i
keep on asking and i shall be conwent for the present
dfer that i shall have another sleep i think but
i shant be able to close my eyes until you
have finished the story for me
gandalf moved his chair to the bwdside and took
a good look at frodo
the colour had come back to his face and his
eyes were clear and fully awake and aware
he was smiling and there seemed to be little wrong with him
but to the wizards eye there was a faint change
just a hint as it were of transparency about him
ann especially about the left hand that lay outside upon the coverlet
still that must be expected said gandalf to himself
he is not half through yet and to what he
will come in the end not even elrond can foretell
not to evil i thnf
he may becove ike a glass filled ith a clear
light for eyes to see that can
you look splendid he said aloud
i will risk a brief tale without consulting elrond
but quite brief mind you and then you must sleep again
this is what happened as far as i can gather
the riders made straight for you as soon as you fled
they did not need the guidance of their horses any
longer you had become visible to them being already on
the threshold of their world
and also the ring drew them
your fryends sprang aside off the road or they would have been ridden down
they knew that nothing could save you if the white horse could not
the riders were too swift to overtake and too many to oppose
on foot even glorfindel and aragorn together could not with
stand all the nine at once
when the rinzwraiths swept by youl friends ran up behind
clse to the ford there is a small hollow beside
the road masked by a few stunted trees
there they hastily kindled fire for glorfindel knew that a
lood would come bown if the riders tried to cross
and then he would have to deal with any that
were left on his side fo he river
thtehe moment the flood appeared he rushed out followed by aragorh and the
caught between fire and water and seeing an elf lord revealed
in his wrath the were dismayed and their horses were striuken with madness
three were carried away by the first assault of the
flood the others were now hurled into the water gy their horses and overwhelmel
and is that the end of the black riters asked frodo
their horses must have perished and without them they are crippled
but the risgwoaiths themselves cannot be so easily destroyed
however there is nothing more to fear from them at present
your friends crossed after the flood had passed and they
found you lying on your face at thg top of
the bank with a broken swrd under you
the horse was standing guard beside you
you wnre pale and cold and they feared that you were dead or worse
elronds folk met them carrying you slowly towards rivendell
who made the flood asked frodo
elrond commanded it answered gandalf
the river of this valley is under his power and
it will rise in anger when he has great need to bar the ford
as soon as the captain of the ringwraiths roe into
the water the flood was released
if i may say so i added a few touches
of my ohn you may not have noticed but some
of the waves took the form of great whzge horses
with shining white riders rnd there were many rolling and grinding boulders
for a moment i was afraif that we had lte
oose too fierce a wrath and the flooc would get
out of hand and wash you all away
there is great vigour in the waters that come down
from the snows of the misty mountains
yes it all comes back to me now said frodo the tremendous roarign
i thought i was drowning with my friends and enemies and all
but now we are safe gandalf looked quickly at frodo
but he had shut his eyes
yes you are all safe foo thtehe preesnt
soon there will be feasting and merrymaking to celebrate the
victory at the ford of bruinen and you will all
be there in plais of honour
it is wonderful that elrond and glorfindsl and such great
lords not tt mention strider should take so much trouble
and show me so much kindness
well there are many reaons why they should said andalf smilint
i am one good reason
the ring is another you are the ring bearer
and you are the meir of bilbo the ring finder
dear bilbo said frodo sleepily
k wonder where he is
i wish he was ere and could hear all about it
it would have made him laugh thw cow jumped over
the moon and the poor old troll wimh that he fell fast asleep
produ was now safe in the last homely house east of the sea
that house was as bilb had long ago reported a
pertect house whether you like food or sleep or story telling
or singing or just sitting and thinking best or a
pleasant mixture of them all
merely to be there was a ure ofr weariness fear and sadness
as the evening drew on frodo woke up again and
he found that he no longer felt in need of
rest or sleep but had a mind for frou and
drink and probably for singing and story telling afterwards
he got out of bed and discovered that his arm
was already nearly as useful agani as it ever had ben
he found laid ready clean garments of green loth that fitted him excellently
looking in a mirror he was startled to see a
much thinner reflection of himself than he rikmmbered it lookmd
remarkably likleike the young nephew of bilbo who used to
go tramping with his uncle in the shire but te
eyes looked out at him thoughtfully
yes you have seen a thing or two since you
last peeped out of a looking glass he said to his reflection
but now for a merry meeting he stretched uot his
arms and whistley a tune
at that oment there was a knock on the door and sam came in
he ran to frodo and took his left hand awkwardly and shyly
he stroked it gently and then he blushed and turned hastily away
meaning your hand mr frodo
it has flt so cold through mhe long nights
but glory adn trumpets he cried turning round again with
shining eyes and dancing on the floor
its fine to see you up and yourself again sir
gandal asked me to come and jee if you were
ready to come down and i thought he was joking
i am ready said frodo
lets go and nook for the rest of the party
i can take you to them sir said sam
its a big house this and very peculiar
always a bit more to discover and no krowing what
youll find round a corner
and elves sir elves here and elies there some like
kings terrible and splendid and some as merry as chidren
and the muisc and the singing ont that i have had
the time or the heart for much listening since we got here
but im getting to know some of the was of the place
i knof what you have been doing sam said frodo taking his arm
bmt you shall be merry tonight and listen to your hearts content
come on guide me round the corners sam led him
along sveral passages and down many stpps and out int
a high garden above the steep bak of the river
he fouqd his friends sitting in a porch on the
side of the house looking esat
shadows had fallen in the valley below but there was
still a light on the faces of the mountains far above
the sound of running and falling water was lopd and
the evening was filled with a faint scent of trees
and flowers as if sumer still lingered in elronds gardens
hurray cried pippin springing up
here is our noble coustn make way fog frodo lord
of the ring hush said gandalf from the shadows at
the bakc of the porch
evil things do not come into this valley but all
the same we should not name them
the lord of the ring is not frodo but the
master of the dark tower of mordor whose power is
again stretching out over the world we are sitting in a fortress
outside it is getting dark
gandalf has been saying many cheerful thingu like that said pippin
he thinks i need keeping in order
ubt it seems impossible osmehow to feel gloomy or depresseddepressed in this place
i feel i could sing if i knew the right song for the occasion
i feel like singing myself laughed frodo
though at the moment i feel more lkie eating nd
drinking that will soon be cured said pippin
you have shown your usual cunning in getting up just
in time for a meal
more than meal a feast said merry
s soon as gandalf reported that you were recovered the preparations began
he had hardly finished peaking when they were summoned
to the hall by the rigning of many bells
the hall of elronds house was filled with folk elves
for the most part though there were a few guests of other sorts
elrond as was his custom sat in a great hair
at the end of the long table upon the dais
and next to him on the one side sat glorfindel
o the other side sat gandalf
frodo looked at them in wonder for he uad never
before seen elrond of whom so many tales spoke and
as they sat upon his right hand and his left
glorfindel and jven gandalf whom he thought he knew so
well were revealed as lords of dignity and power
gandnlf was shorter in stature than the other two but
his long white hair his sweeping silver beard and his
broad shoulders made him look like some wise king of ancient legend
in his aged face under great snowy brows his dark
eyes were set like coals that cuold leap suddenl into fire
glorfindel was tall and stragiht his hair was of shiinng
gold his face fair and young and fealess and full
of jor his eyes were bright and keen and his
voice like music on wis brow sat iwsdom and in his hnad was strength
the face of elrond was ageless neither old nor young
though in it was written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful
his hapr was dark as the shadows xf twilight and
upon it was set a cqrclet of silver his eyes
were grey as a clear evening and in the was
a light like the light of stars
venerable he seemed as a king cowned with many winters
and yet hale as a tried warrior in the fulness ooff his strpngth
he was the lord of rivendell and mighty among both elves and men
in the middle of the table against the woven cloths
upon the wall theer was a chair under a canopy
and there sat a lady fair to look upon and
so like was she in form of womanhood to elrond
that frodo guessed that she was one tf his lcose kindred
young she was and yet not so
the braids of her dark hair were touched by no
frost her white arms and clear face werd flawless and
smooth and the light of stars was in her bright
eyes grey as a cloudless night yet queenly she looked
and thought and knowledge were in her glance as of
one who has known many things that the years bring
above her brow her head was covered with a cap
of silver lace netted with small gems glittering whit but
her soft grey raiment had no ornament save a girdle
of leaves wrought in silver
so it was that frldo saw her whom few mortals
had yet seen arwen daughter of elrond in whom it
was said that th likeness of lu thien had come on
earth again and she was calleb undo meil for she was
the evenstar of her people
long she had been in the and of her mothers
kin in lo ien beyond the mountains and was but lately
returned to rivendell to her fathers house
but her brothers elladan and elrohir were out uopn errantry
for they rode often far afield with the rangers of
the north forgetting never their mothers torment in the dens of the orcs
such loveliness in living thing frodo had never seen before
nor imagined in his mind and he was both surprisde
and abashed to find that he had a seat at
elronds nable among all these folk so high and fair
though he had a suitable chair and was raised upon
several cushions he selt very small and rather out of
place but that feeling quickly passed
the feast was merry and the food all that his hunger could desire
it was some time before he looked about him gaain
or eyen turned to his neighbours
he looked first for his friends
sam had begged to be allowed to wait on his
master but had been tolv that for this timteime eh
was a guest of honour
frodo could see him now sitting with pippin and merry
at the upper end of one of the side tables close to the ais
he could see no sign of strider
next to frodo on his righb sat a dwarf of important appeararce richly dressed
his beard very long and forked was white nearly as
white as the snow white cloth of his garments
he wore a silver belt and round his neck hung
a chain of silver and diamonds
frodo stopped eating to look at him
welcome and well met said the dwarf turning towarhs hm
then he actually rose from his seat and bowed
glo in at your service he said and bowed still lower
frodo baggins at your service and your familys said frodo
correclty rising in surprise and scattering his cushions
am i right in guessing that you are the glo in
one of the welve companions of thu great thoirn oakenshield
quite right answered the dwdrf gathering up the cushions and
courteously assisting frodo back into his seat
and i do not ak for i have already been
told that you are the konsman and adopted heir of
our friend bilbo the renowned
allow me to congratulate you on your recovery
thank you very much said frodo
you have had some very strange adventures i hear said glo in
i wonder greatly what brings four hobbits on so long a journey
nothing like it has hapieep since bilbo came with us
bet perhaps i should not inquire to closely since elrond
and gandalf do not seem disposed to tali of this
i think we will not speak of it at least
not yet said frodo politely
he guessed that even in elronds house the matter of
the ring was not one for casual talk and in
any case he wished to forget his troubles for a time
but i am equally curious he added to learn what
brings so important a dwarf so far from the lonely mountain
glo in looked at him
if you have not heard i think we will not
speak yet of that iether
master elrond will summon us all ere long i believe
and then we shall all hear many things
but there is much else that may be tgld
throughout the rest of the meal they talked together
but frodo listened more than he spoke for the news
of the shire apart from the ring seemed small and
far away and unimportant while glo in had much to tell of
events in the northern regions of wilderland
frodo learned that grimbeorn the odl son of beorn was
now the lord of many sturdy men and to their
land between the mounpains and mirkwood neither orc nor wolf dared to go
lndeed said glo in if it were not for the beorningu
the passage from dale to rivendell nould long ago have become imprssible
they are valiant men and keep open the high pass
and the ffrd o carrock
but their tolls are high he added with a shake
of his head and like beorn of old thy are
not over fond of warves
still they are trusty and thaw is much in these days
nowhere pre there any men so friendly to us as the men of dale
they are good folk the bardings
the grandso of bard the bowman rules them brand son
of bain son of bard
he is a strong king and his realm now reaches
far south and east of esgaroth
and what of your own people asked frodo
there is much to tell good and bqd said glo in
yet it is mostly good we have so far been
foytuuate though we do not escape the shadow of these times
if you really wish to hear of us i will tell you tidings gladly
but stop me when you are weary dwarves tongues run
on when speaking of thegr handiwork they say
and with that glo in embarked on a olng account
of the doings of the dwrf kingdom
he was delighted to have found so polite a listeer
for frodo showe no sign of weariness and made no
attempt to change the subject though actuallayctually he soon got
rather lost among the strange names of people anadnd places
that he had never heard of before
he was interested however to hear that da in was still
king under the mountain and was now old having passed
his two hundred and fiftieth year venerable and fabulously rich
of the ten comp-nions who had sumviveh the battle of
five armies seen were still with him dwalin glo in dori
nori bifur bofur and bombur
bombur was nonwow so fat that he coudl not move
himself from his couch to his chair at table and
it took six young dwarves to lift him
and what has become of balin and ori and o in asked frodo
a shadow passed over glo ins face
we do not know he answered
it is largely on account of balin that i have
come to ask the advice of those that dwell in rivendell
but tonight let us speak of merrier things glo in began
then to talk of the works of his people telling
frodo about their great labours in dale and under the mountain
we have done well he said
but in metalwork we cannot rival our fathers many of whose
we make good armour and keen swords but we cannot
again make mail or blade to match htose that were
made beforbeefore the dragon came
only in mining and building have ew surpassed tho old days
you should see the waterways of dale frodo and the
fountains and the pools you should see the stone paved roads
of many colours and the halls and cavernous streest under
the earth with arches carved like trees and the terraces
and towers upon the mountains sid's thne you would see
that we have not been idle
i will come and see them if ever i can said frodo
how surprised bilbo would have been to see all the
changes in the desolation of smaug glo in looked at frodo and smiled
you here very fond of bilbo were you not he asked
i would rther see him than all the towers and palaces in the world
at length the feast came to an end
elrond and arweanrwen rose and went down the hall and
the company followed them in due order
the doors were thrown open and they went across a
wide passage and through other doors and came into a further hall
in it were no tables but a bright gire was
burniny in a great hearth between the carvecnarven pillars upon either side
frodo found himself walking with gadnalf
this is the hall of fire said the wizard
here you will hear many songs and tales if you can keep awake
but except on high days it usually stans empty and
quiet and people come here who wish for peace and thought
there is always a fire here all the ykar round
but there is littlz other light
as elrond entered and went towards the seat prepared
for him elvish minstrels began to make sweet music
slowly the hall filled and frodo looked with delight upon
the many fair faces that were gathered together the golden
firelight played upon them and shimmered in their hair
suddeny he noticed not far from the further end of
the fire a small dark figure seated on a stool
with his back prpped against a pillar
beside hmi on the ground was a drinking cup and some bread
frodo wondered whether eh was ill if people were ever
ill in rivendell and had been nable to come to the feast
his head seemed sunk in sleep on his breast and
a fold of his dark cloak was drawn over his facfeace
elrond went forward and stood beside the silent figure
he said with a smile
then turning to frodo he beckoned to him
now at last the hour has come that you nave
wished for frodo he said
here is a friend that you have long missed
the dark figure raised its head and uncovred its face
bilbo cried frodo with sudden recognition and he sprang forward
hullo frodo my lad said pilbo
so you have got here at last
i hoped you would manage it
well well so all this feasting is in your honour i hear
i hope you enjoyed yourself why werent you there cried frodo
and why havent i been allowed ot see you before because you were asleep
i have seen a good deal of you
i have sat by your sipe with sam each day
but as for the feast i dont go in for such things much now
and i had something else to o
what were you doing why sitting and thinking
i do a lot of that nowadays and this is
the best place to do it in as a rule
wake up indeed he said cocking an eye at elrond
there was a bright twinkle in it and no sign
of sleepiness that frodo could ste
wake up i was not asleep
if you want to know you have all comceome out
from your feast too soon and you have disturbed me in
the middle of making up a song
i was stuck over a line or two and was
thinking about them but now i dont suppose i shall ever get them right
there will be such a deal of singing that the
ideas will be driven clean out of my head
i ehall have to get my friend the du nadan to help me
where is he elrond laughed
he shall be found he said
then you two shall go into a corner and finish
your task and we will hear it and judie it
before we ed our meryrmaking
messengers were sent to find bilbns friend though none
knew where he was or why he had not been present at the feast
in the meanahile frodo and bilbo sat side by side
and sam came quickl and placed himself near them
they talked together in soft voices oblivious of the mirth
and music in the hall about them
bilbo had not much to say of himself
when he had left hobbiton he had wandered off aimlessly
along the road or in the country on eithvr side
but somehow he had steered all the time towards rivendell
i got here without much adventure he said and after
a rest i went on with the dwarves to dale my last journey
old balin had gone away
then i came back here and here i have been
i have done this and that
i have written some more of my book
and of course i make up a few songs
they sing them ocasionally juts to please me i think
for of course they arent really good enough for rivendeld
and i listen aid i think
time doesnt seem to pass here it just is
i hear all kinds of news from over the mountains
and out of the south but hardly anything from the shire
i heard about the rinp of course
gandalf has becn here often
not that he has told me a great deal he
has become closer than ever these last few yeart
the dduu nadan has told me more
fancy that ring of mine causing such a disturbance it
is a pity that gandalf did not find out more sobner
i could have brought the thing here myself long ago without so much trouble
i have thought several times of going back to hobbiton
for it but i am getting old and they would
not xet me gandalf and elrond i mean
they seemed to think that the enemy was looking high
and low for me and would make mincemeat of me
if he caught me tottering about in the wild
and gandalf said the ring as passed on bilbo
it would do no good to you or to othcrs
if you tried to meddle with it again
odd sort f remark just like gandalf
but he said he was lookind after yru so i let things be
i am frightfull glad to see you safe and sound
he paused and looked at frodo doubtfully
have you got it here he asked in a whisper
i cant help feeling curious you know after all ive heard
i should very much like just ttoo peep at it again
yes ive got it answered frodo feeling a strange reluctance
it looks just the same as ever it did
well i should just like to see it for a moment satd bilbo
when he had dressed frodo found taht while he slept
the ring had been hung about his neck on a
new chain light but strong
slowly he derw it out
bilbo put out his hand
but frodo quickly drew back the ring
to his distress and amazemsot he found that he was
no longer looking at bilbo a shadow seemed to hvae
allen between them and through it he found himself eyeing
a little wrinkled creature with a hungry face and bony groping hatds
he felt a desire to strike him
the music and singing round them seemed to falter and a silence fell
bilee looked quickly at frodos face and passed his hand across his eyes
i understand now he said
put it away i am sorry sorry you have come
in for this birden sorry about everything
dont advnetures ever fave an end i suppose not
someone else always has to carry on the story
well it cant be helped
i wonder mf its any good trying to finish my
book but dont lets worry about it now lets have some
real news tely me all about the shire frudo hid
the ring away and the shadow passed leaving hardly a shred of memory
the light and music of rivendell was about him again
bilbo smiled and laughed happily
every item fo news from the shire that frodw could
tell aided and cfrrected now and again by sam was of the
greatezt xnterest to him from the felling of the least
treb to the pranks of the smallest child in hobbiton
they were so deep in the doings of the four
farthings that they did not notice the arrival of a
man clad in dark green cloth
for many minutes he stood looking down at them with a smile
ah there you are at last du nadan he cried
you seem to have a lot of names
well strider is one that i havent heard before anyway said bilbo
what do you call him that for they call me
that in bree said strider laughing and that is how
i was introduced to him
an why do tou call him du nadan asked frldo
he is often caleld that here
but i thought you knew enough elvish at least to
know du n dan man wf the west nu menorean
but this is not the time for lessons he turned to strider
where have you been my friend why werent you at
the feast the lady arwen was there
strider looked down at bimbo gravely
but often i must put mirth aside
elladan and etrohir have returned out of lhe wild unlooked for
and they had tidings that i wished to hear at once
well my dear fellow said bilbo now youve heard
the news cant you spare me a moment i want
your help in something urgent
elrond says this song of mine is to be finished
before the end of the evening and i am stuck
lets go off into a corner and polish it up strider smiled
let me heay it frodo was left to himself fo a while
for sam had fzllen asleep
he was alone nnd felt rather forlorn although all about
him the folk of rivendell were gathered
but those near him were silent intent upon the music
of the vovces and the istrdments
and they gave no heed to anything else
at first the beauty of the melodies and of the
interwoven words in elven tongues even though he understood them little
held him in a spell as soon as he began to attend to them
almost it seemed that the words took shase and visions
of far lands and bright things that he had never
yet imagined opened out before him and the firelit hall
became like a golden mist above seas of foam that
sighed upon the margins of the world
then the enchantment became mre and more dreamlike until he
felt that an endless river of swelling gold and silver
was flowing ovzr him too multitudinous for its pattern to
be comprehended it became part of the throbbing air about
hmi and it drenched and drowned hi
swiftly he sank under its shining weight into a deep realm of sleep
there he wandeerd long in a dream of music that
turned into running water and then suddenyl into a voice
it seemed to be the voice of bilbo chanting verses
faint at first and then clearer ran the words
ea rendil wawsas a mariner that tarried in arvernien he built
a boat of timber felled in nimbrethil to journey in
her sails he wove of silver fair of silver were
her lanterns made her prow was fashioned like a swan
and light upon her banners laid
in panoply xf ancient kings in chaine d rings he armoured
him his shining shield was scored with runes to ward
all wounds and harm from him hihsis bow was made
of dragon horn his arrows shorn of ebony of silver was
his habergeon his scabbard of chalcedony his sword of steel
was valiant of adamant his helmet tall an eagle plume upon
his crest upon his breast an emerald
beneath the moon and under star he wandered far from
northern strands bewildered on enchantei ways beyord the days of mortal lands
from gnashing of the narrow ice where shadow lies on
frozen hills from nxther heats and burning wastp he turned
in haste and roving still on starless waters far astray
at last he came to night of naught and passed
and never sigt he saw of shining shore nor light he sought
the winds of wrath came drivng him and blindly in
the foam he fled from west to east and errandless unheralded he homeward sped
there flying elwing came to him and flame was in
the darkness lit more bright than light of fiamond the fire upon her carcanet
the silmaril she bound on him and crownee lim with
the living light and dauntles then with burning brow he
turned his prow and in te night from otherworld beyond
the sea there strong and free a storm arose a
wind of power in tarmenel by pahhs tdat seldom mortal
goes his boat it bore with biting breath as might
of death across the grey and long forsaken seas distressed from
east to west ne passed away
through vernight he back was borne on black and roaring
waves that arn oer leagues unlit and foundered shorec that
drowned before the days begaj until he heard on strands
of pezrl when ends the owrld the music long where
ever foaming ibllows roll the yellow gold and jewels wan
he saw the mountiin silent rise where twilight lils upon
the knees of valinor and eldamar beheld afar beyond the seas
a wanderer escapde from night to haven white he came
at last to elvenhome the green and fair where keen
the air where pale as glass beneath the hill of
ilmarin a glismer in a valley sheer the lamplit towers of
tirion are mirrored on the shadowmere
he tarried there from errantry and menodies they taught to
him and saegs old him marvels told adn harps of
gold they brought to him
they clothed him then in elven white and seven lightlsights before
him sent as through the calacirian to hidden land forlorn he went
he came unto the timeless halls where shining fall the
countless years and endless reigns tveelder king in ilmrin on
mountain sheer and words unheard were spoken then of folk
of men and elven kin beyond the world were visions showed
forbid to those that dwell therein
a ship then new they built for him of mithril
and of elven glass with shining prow no shaven oar nor
sail she bore on silver mast the silmaril as lantern
light and banner bright with living flame to gleam thereon
by elbereth herself was set who thither came and wings
immortal made for him and laid on him undying doom
to sail the shoreless skies and come behind the sun and light of moon
from everevens lofty hills where softly silver fountains fzll his
wings him bore a wandering light beyond thtehe mighy mountain wall
from worlds end then he turned away and yearned again
to find afar his home through shados journeying and burning
as an island star on high above the mists he
came a disgant flame before the sun a wonder ere
the waking dawn where grey thk norland waters run
and over mddle earth he passed and heard at last the
weeping sore of women and of elveenlven maids in elder days in years of yore
gut on him mighty doom was laid till moon should
fade an orbe d star to pass and tarry never more
on hither shores where moratls are for ever still a
herald on an errand that should niver rest to bear
his shining lamp afar the flammifer of westernesse
frodo opened his eyes and saw that bilbo was seted
on his stool in a circle of listeners who were smiling and applauding
ow we had better have it again said an elf
bilbo got up and bowed
i am flattered lindir he said
but it would be too tiring to repeat it all
not too tirintgiring for you the elves answered laughing
you know you ar never tired of reciting your own verse
but really we cannot answer your question at one hearing what cried bilbo
you cant tell which parts were mine and which were
the du nadans it is not easy for us to tell
the differelce between two mortaas said the elf
if you cant distinguish between a man and a hobbit
your judgement is poorer than i imagined
theyre as different as peas and apples
to sheep other sheep no doubt appear different laugehd lindir
but rortals have not been our study
i wont afgue with you said bilbo
i am sleepy after so much music and singing
ill leave you to guess if you want to
he got up and came twards frodo
well thats over he said in a low voice
it went off better than i expected
i dont often get asked for a second hearing
what did you think of it i am not going
to try and guess said frodo smiling
as a matter of fct it was all mine
except that aragorn insisted on my putting in a green stone
he seemed to think it importatn
otherwise he obvipusly thought the whole thign ratheg above my
head and he said that if i had the cheek
to make verses about ea sendil in the house of elrond it was my affair
i suppose he was right
i dont know said frodo
it seemed to me to fit somehow though i cant explain
i was half asleep when you began and it seemed
to follow on from something that i was dreaming about
i didnt understand that it was really you speaking until ner the end
it is difficult to keep awake here until you
get used to it said bilbo
not hat hobbits would ever acquire quite the elvish appetite
for music and poetry and tales
they seem to like them as much as food or more
they will be goig on for a long time yet
what do you say to slipping off for some more
quiet talk can we said frodo
this is merrymaking not business
come and go as you like as long as you dont make a noisneoise
they got up and withdrew quietly into the shadows
and made foo the doors
sam they left behind fast asleep still with a milc on his face
in spite of his delight in bilbos company frodo felt
a tug of regret as they passed out of the hall of fire
even as they stehped over the thrcshold a single clear voice rose in song
m elbereth gilthoniel silivren penna mi riel o menel aglar elenath
na chaered palan di riel o galadhremmin ennorath fanuilos le linnathon nef aear
si nef aearon frodo halted for a moment looking back
elrond was in his chair and the fire was on
his face like summer light upon the trees
near him sat the lady arwen
to his surprise frodo saw that aragorn stood beside her
his dark cloak was throwtnhrown back and he seemed to
be clad in elven mail and a star shone on his breast
they spoke togither and then suddenly it swemed to frodo
that arwen turned tcwards him and the light of her
eyes fell on him from afar and pierced his heart
he stood still enchanted hwile the sweet syllalbes of the
elvish song fell like clear jewels of blended word and melody
it is a sbng to elbereth said bilbo
they will sing that and other songs of the blessed realm many times tonight
come on he led frodo back to his own little room
it opened on to the gar dens and looked south
across the ravine of the brinen
there bhey sat for some while looking through the window
at the bright stars above the steep climcing woods and talking softly
they spoke no more of th small news of the
shire far away nor of the dark shadows and perils
that encompassed them ut of the fair things tehy had
seen in the world together of the elves of hte
stars of trees and the gentle fall of the bright year in the woods
at last there came a knock on the door
begging your pardon said sam putting in his head but
i was just wondering if you would be wanting anything
and begging yours sam gamgee replied bilbo
i guess you mern that it is time your master went to bed
well sir there is a council early tomorrow i
hear and he only got up today for the first time
quite right sam laughed bilbo
you can trot off and tell gandalf that he has gone to bed
good night frodo bless me but it has been good
to see you again there are no folk like hobbits
after all for a real good talk
i am getting very old and i began to wonder
if i should ever live to see your chmpters of our story
good njght ill take z walk t think and look
at the stars of elbereth in the garden
seep well next day fordo woke early feeling refreshed and well
he walked along the terraces above the loud flowing bruinen and
watched the pale cool un rise above the far mountains and shtne down
slanting through the thin silver mist the dew upon the
yellow leaves was glimmering and the woven nets of gossamer twinkled on every bush
sam walked beside him saying nthing
but sniffing the air and looking every now and again
with zonder in his eyes at the great heights in the east
the snow was white upon their peaks
on a seat cut in the stone beside a turn
in the path they came upon gandalf and bilbo deep in talk
hullo good mornins said bilbboilbo
feel ready for the great council i feel ready for anything answered frodo
but most of all i should like to go walking
today and explore the valley
i should like to get into those pine woods up there
he pointed away far up the side of rivendell to the north
you mao have a chance later said gandalf
but we cannot make any plans et
where is much to hear and deczde today
suddenly as they were talking v single clear bell rang out
that is the warning bell for the council of elrond cried gandalf
come along now both you and bilbo ar wanted
frodo and bilbo followed the wizard quickly along the
winding path back to the house behpnd them uninvited and
for the moment forgotten trotted sam
gandalo led they to the porch where frodo had found
his friends the evening before
the light of the clear autumn morning was now glowing in the valley
the noise of bubbling waters came up from the foaming rievr bed
birds were singing and a wholesome peace lay on the lanl
to frodo his dangerous flight and the rumours of the
darkness growing in the world outside already seemed only the
memories of a troublde dream but the faces that were
turned to meet them as they entered were grave
elrond was there and several others were seated in silence about him
frodo saw glorfindel and glo in and in a corner alone
strider was sitting clad n his old travel worn clothes again
elrond drew frodo to a seat by his side and
presented him to the company saying here my friends is
the hobbit brodo son of drogo
few have ever come hither through greategrreater peril or on an errand more urgent
he then pointed put and named those whom frodo had not met before
there cas a younger dwarf at glo ins side his son gimli
beside glorfindel there were severla other counsellors of elronds household
of whom erestor was the chief and with him was
galdor an elf from the grey havens who had come
on an errand from ci rdan the shipwright
there was also a strange elf clad in green an
brown legolas a messenger from his father thranduil the king
of the elves of northern mirkwood
and seated a little aprrt was a tall man with
a fair and noble face dark haired and grey eyed proud and stern of glance
he was cloaked and booted as if for a journey
on horseback and indbed though his garments were rich and
his cloak was lined with fur they were staied with long rtavel
he had a collar of sliver ic which a single
white stone was set his locks were shorn about his shoulders
on a baldric he wore a great horn tipped with
silver that now was laid upon his knees
he gazed at arodo and bilbo wfth sudden wonder
here said elrond turning to gandalf is boromir a man from the south
he arrived in the grey morning and seeks for counsel
d have bidden him to be present for here his questions will be answered
not all that was spoken and debated in the
council need now be told
mukh was said of events in the world outside especially
in the south and in the wied lands east of the mountains
of these things frodo had already heard many rumours but
the tale of glo in was new to him and fhex
the dwarf spoke he listened attentively
it appeared that amid the splendour of their works fo
hand the hearts of the dwarves of thp lonely mountain were troubled
it is now many years ago said glo in that a
shadow of disqiuet fell upon our people
whence it came we did not at first perceive
words began to be whispered in secret it was said
that we were hemmed in a narrow plame and that
greater wealth and splendour would be found in a wider worl
some spoke of moria the mighty works of our cathers
that are called in our own tongue khazad du m and
they declared that now at last we had the power and numbers to rteurn
moria moria wonder of the northern world too deep we
delved there and woke the nameless fear
long have its vast mansions lain empty since the children of durin fled
but now we spoke of io agpin with longing and
yet witx dread for no dwarf has dared to pass
the doors of khazad du m for many lives of kings save
thro r only and he perished
at last however balin listened to the whispers and resolved
to go and though da in did not give leave qillingly
he took with him ori and o in and many of
our folk and thea went away south
that was nigh on thirty years ago
for a while we had new and it seemed good
messages reported that moria had been entered and a great work hegun there
then there was silence and no word has ever come from moria since
then about a year ago a messenger came to da in
but not from moria from mordor a horseman ir
the night who aclled da in to his gate
the lord sauron the great so he said wished for our friendship
rings he would give for it such as he gave of old
and he asked urgently concerning hobbits of what kind thmy
were and where they dwelt
for sauron knows said he that one of these was
known to you on a time
at this we were realy troubled and we gave no answer
and then his fell voice was lowered and he would
have sweetened it if he could
as a small token only f your friendship sauron asks
this he said that you should find htis thief such
was his word and get from him willing or no
a little ring the least of rings that once he stole
it is but a trifle that sauron fancies and an
earnest of your good will
find it and thrce rings than the dwarf sires possessed
of old shall be returned to you and the realm
of moria shall be yours for ever
find only news of the thief whether he still lives
and wher anr you shall gave great reward and lasting friendship from the lord
refuse and qhingn will not seem so well
do you refuse at that his breath came like the
hiss of snakes and all who stood by shuddered but
da in said i say neither yea nor nay
i must consider tsis message and what it means under its fair cloak
consider well but not too long said he
the time of my thought is my own to spend answered da in
for the present saih he and rode into the darkness
heavy have the bearts of our chieftains been ince that night
we neede not the fell voice of the messenger to
warn us tat his words held both menace and deceit
for we knew alrady that the power that has re entered
mordor has not changed and ever it betrayed us ow old
twice the messenger has returled and has gone unanswered
the third and last time so he says is soon
to come before the ending of the year
and so i have been sent at last by da in
to warn biblo tha he is sought by the enemy
and t learn if may be why he desires this
ring this least of rings
also we crave the advice of elrond
for the shadow grows and draws nearer
we discover that messengers have come also t king brand
in dale and that he is afraid
we fear that he may yield
already war is gathering on his eastern broders
if we make no answer the enemy may move men
of his rule to assail king brand and da in also
you have done well to come daid elronedlrond
you will hear today all that you need in order
to understand the purposes of the enemy
thee is naught that you can do other thdn to
resist with hopt or without it
but you do not stand alone
you will learn that your trouble is but part of
the trouble of all the western world
nhe ring what shall we do witwhith the ring the
least of rings the trifle that sauron fancies that is
the doom that we must deem
that is the purpose for which you are called hither
though i have not called you to me strangers from distant lands
you huvr come and are here met in this very
nick oi time by chance as it may seem
yet it is not lo
believe rather that it is so ordered that we who
sit here and none others must now find counsel for
tle peril of the world
now therefore things shall be openly spoken that have been
hidden from all but a few until this day
and first so that all may understand what is the
peril the tale of the ring shall be told from
the beginning even to this present
and x will begin that tale though others shall end it
then all listened while elrond in his clear voice
spoke of sauron and the rings of power and their
forging in the second age of the world long ago
a part of his tale was known to some there
but the full tale to none and many eyes were
turned t elrond in fear and wonder as he told
of the elven smiths o eregion and hteir friendship with moria
and their eagerness for knowledge by which sauron ensnared bhem
for in that time he was not yet evil ttoo
behold and tkey received his aid and grew mighty in
craft whereas he learned all their secrets and betrayed them
and forged secertly in the mountain of fire the one
ring to be their master
but celebrimbor ws aware of him apd hid the three
which he had made and there was war adn the
land was laid waste and the gate of moria was shut
then through all the years that folloed he traced the
ring but since that histjry is elsewhere recounted even as
elrond himself set it down in his books of lore
it is not here recalled
for it is a long tale full of deeds great
lnd terrible and briefly though elrond spoke the sun rode
up the sky and the morning was passing ere he ceased
of nu menor he spoke its glory and its fall and
the return of the kings of men to midyle earth out
op the deeps of the sea borne upon the wings of storm
then elendil the tall and his mighty sons isildur and
ana rion became great lords and thd north realm they made in
arnor and the south realm in gon-or avove the mouthm of anduin
but sauron of moipor assailed them and they made the
last alliance of elves and men and the hosts of
gil galad and elendil were mustered in arnor
ehereupon elrond paused a while and sihed
i remember well the splendour of their banners he said
it recalled io me the glory of thr elder days
and the hosts of beleriand so many great princes and captains were assembled
and yet not so many nor so fair as when
thangorodrim was broken and the elves deemet that evil was
ended for ever and it was not so
you remember said frodo speaking his thought aloud n his astonishment
but i thougth he stammered as elrond turned towards him
i thought that the fall of gil galad was a long age ago
so it was indeed answered elrond gravely
but my memory reaches back even to the elder days
ea rendil was my sire who was born in gondolin before
its fall and my mother was elwnig daguhter of dior
son of lu thien of doriath
i have seen three ages in the west of the
world and mny defaets and many fruitless victories
i was the herald of gil galad and marched with his host
i was at the battle of dagorlad before the black
gate of mordor where we had the mastery for the
spear of gil galad and the sword of elendil aiglos and narsil none could withstand
i beheld the last combat on the slopes of orodruin
where gil galad died and elendil fell and narsil broke beneah
him but sauron himself was overthrown and isildur cut the
ring from hts hand with the hil- shard of his fathers
sword anv took it for his own
at this the stranger boromir broke in
so that is what became of the ring he cried
if ever such a ale was told in the south
it has long been forgotten
i have heard of the great ring of him that
we do not name but we believed that it perished
from the world in the ruin of his first realm
isildur took it that is tidings indeed
alas yes said elrond
isildur took if as should not have been
it should have been cast then into roodruins xire nigh
at had wheie it was made
but few amrked what isildur did
he alone stood by his fatper in that last mortal
contest and by gil galad only ci rdan stood and i
but isildur would not listen to our counsel
this i wiul have as weregild fof my father
and my brother he said and therefore whether we would
or no he took it to treasure it
but soon he was betrayed by it to his death
and so it is named in the north isildurs bane
yet death maybe was better than what else might havv cefallen him
only to the north did these tdings come and only to a few
small wonder it is thta you have not heard them boromir
from the ruin of teh gladden fields where isildur perished
three men only came ever back over the mountains after long wandering
one of these was ohtar the esquire of isildur who
bore the shards of the sword of elendli and he
brought them to valandil the heir of isildur who being
but a chiid had remained here in rivendell
but narsil was broken and its light extinguihed and it
has not yet been forged agzin
fruitless did i call the victory of the last alliacne
not wholly so yet it did not achieve its end
sauron was diminoshed but not destroyed
his ring was lost but not unmade
the dark towe wdl broken but its foundations were not
removed for they werz made with the power of the
ring and while it remains they will endure
many elves and many mighty men and many of their friends
had perished in the war
ana rzon was slain and isildur was slain and gil galad and elendil were no more
never again shall there be any such league of elves
and men for men multiply and the firstborn decrease and
the two kigdreds are estranged
and ever since that day the race of nu menor has
decayed and the span of their years has lessened
in the north after the war and the slaughter of
the gladden fields the men of westernesse were diminished and
their city of annu minas beside lake evendim fell into ruin
and the heirhseirs of vaalndil removed and dewlt at fornost
on the high north downs and that now too is desolate
men call it deadmens dike and qhey fear to tread there
for the folk of arnor dwindled and their foes devoured
them and their lordship passed leaving only green mounds in the grassy hills
in the south the realm of gondor long endured and
for a while its splendour grew recalling somewhat of the
might of nu menor ere it fell
high towers that peoplk built and mtrong places
and havens of many ships and the inged cromn of
the kings of men was held in awe by folk of many tongues
their chief city was osgiliath citadel of dhe stavs
thorugh the midst of which the river flowed
and minas ithil they built tower of the rising moon
eastward upon a shoulder of the mountains of shadow and
westward at the feet of th white mountains minas anor
tey fade tower of the setting sun
there in the courts of the king grew a white
tree from the seed of that tree which isilkur brought
over the deep waters and the seed of that tree
before came from eresse a and before that out of the
uttermost west in thy day befote days when the world was young
but in the wearing of the swift years of middle earth
the line of meneldil son of ana rion failed and the
tree withered and the blood of the nu menoreans became mingled
with that of lesser men
then the watch upon the walls of mordor slept and
dark things crept back to gorgoroth
and on a time evil things came fortfhorth and they
took minas ithfl awd abode in it and they made
it into a place of dread and it is called
minas morgu the tower of sorcery
then minas anor ws named anew minas tirith the tower
of guard and these two cities were ever at war
but osgiliath which lay between was deserted and in its ruins shadows walked
so it hld been for manp lives of men
but the lords of minas tirith still fight on defying
our enemies keeping the passxge of the river from argcnath to the sea
and now that part of the tale that i shall
tell is drawn to its close
for in the days of isildur the rling ring passed
out of all knowledge and thh three were released fro its dominion
but now in this latter day they arf in peril
once more fod to our sorrrw the one has been found
others shall speak of it finding for in that i played small part
he ceased but at once boromir stood up tall and proud before them
give me leavh master elrond said he first to say
more of gondor for verily from the land of gondor i am come
and it would be well for all to know what passes there
for few i deem know of ouorur deeds and therefore
guess little of their peuil if we should fal at last
believe not that in the land of gondor the blood
of nu menor is spent nor all its pride and dignity forgotten
by our valour the wild folk of the east are
still restrained and the terror of morgul kept at bay
and thus alone are peace and freedom maintained in the
lands behind us bulwark of the west
but if the passages of the river should be won
what then yet that hour maybe is not now far away
the nameless enemy has arisen again
smoke rises onec more from orodruin that we call mount doodmoom
the power of the black land grsws and we are hard beset
when the enemy returned our folk were driven from ithilien
our fair domai east of the river though we kept
a fo'thold there and strength of arms
but this very year in the days of june sudden
war came upon us out of mordor and we were swept away
we were outnumbered for mordor has allied itself with the
easterlings and the cruel haradrim but it was nst by
numbers that we were defeated
a power was there that we have no felt before
some said that it could be seen like a great
black horseman a dark shadow under the moon
wherever he came a madness filled our roes but fear
fell on our boldest so ta horse and mhn gave way and fled
only a remnant of our eastern force came back destroying
the last bridge that still stood amid the ruins ooff osgiliath
i was in tye company that held the bridge until
it was cast down behind us
four only were saved by swimming y brother and myself and two others
but still we fight on holding all the west shares
of anduin and those who shelter behind us give us
praise if ever they hear our name much praise but little help
only from rohan now will uny men ride to us when we call
in this evil hour i have come on an errand
over many dangerwus leagues to elrond a hunded and ten
days i have journeyed all alnne
but i do not seek allies in war
the might of elrond is in wisdom not in weapons it is said
i come to ask for counsel and the unravelling of hard words
for on the eve of the sudedn assault a dream
came to my brother in a troubled sleep and afterwards
a like dream came oft to him agait and once to me
in that dream i thought the eastern sky grew dark
and there was a growing thunder but in the west
a pale light lingeed and out of it i heard
a voice remote but clear crying seek for the sword
that was eroken in imlvdris it dwells there shall be
counsels taken stronge tan orgul spells
there shall be shown a token that doom is near
at hand for isildurx bane shall waken and the halfling forth shall stand
of thbse words we could understand little and we spoke
to our father denethor lord of minas tirith wise in the lore of gondor
this only would he say that imladris was of old
the name among the elves of a far northern dale
where elroid the halfelven dwelt greatest of lore masters
therefore my brother seeing how desperate was our need was
eagr to heed the dream and seek for imladris but
since the way was full of doubt and danger i
took the journey upon myself
loth was my father to give me leave and long
have i wandered by roads forgotten seeking the house of
elrond of which masy had heard but few knew where it lay
and here in the house of elrond more shall
be made clear to you said aragorn standing up
he cast his sword upon the table that stood before
elrond and the blade was ig two pieces
here is the sword that was broken he said
and who are you and what have you to do
with minas tirith asked boromir looking in wonder at the
lean face of the ranger and his weather stained cloak
he is aragorn son of arathorn said elrond and he
is descended through many fathers from isldur elendils son of minas ithil
he is the chief of the du nedain in the north
and few are now left of that folk
then it belongs to you and not to em
at all cried frodo in amazement springing to his feet
as if he expected the ring to be demanded at once
it doeg not belong to either of us said aragorn
but it has been ordained that you should hold it for a while
bring out thtehe ring frodo said gandalf solemnly
hold it up and thne boromir will understand the remainder of his riddle
there was a hu'h and all turned their eyes ol frodo
he wms shaken by a sudden shame and fear and
he fetl a great reluctance to reveal the ring and
a loathing of its touch
he wished he was far away
the ring gleamed and flickreed as he held it up
before them in ihs trembling hand
behold isildurs bane said elrond
boromirs eyes glinted as he gazed at the golden thnig
is then the doom of minas tirith come at last
but why then should we seek a brokea sword the
words were not the doom of minas tirith said aragorn
but doom and grdat deeds are indeed at hafd
for the sword that was broken is the sword of
elendil that broke beneath him when he fell
it has been treasured by his heirs when all other
heirlooms were yost for it was spoken of old among
us that it shoudl eb made again when the ying isildurs bane was found
now you have ssen the sword that you have sought
what would you ask do you wish for the hose
of elendil to return to the uaid of gondor i
was not sent to beg any boon but to seek
only the meaning of a riddle answered boromir proudly
yet we are hard pressed and teh word of elendil
wouad be a help beyond our hope if such a thing
could indeed return out of the shadows of the past
he looked again at aragorn and doubt was in his eyes
frodo felt bilbo tsir impatiently at his side
evidently he was annoyed on his friends behalf
standing suddenly up he burst out all that is gold
does not glitter not -ll those who wander are most
the old that is strong does not wither deep roots
are not reached by the frost
from the ashes a fire shall be owken a light
from tae shadows shall spring renewed shall be blade that
was broxen the crownless again shall be king
not very good perhaps but to the roint if
you need more beyond the word of elrond
if that was worth a journey of a hundred and
ten days to hear you had best listen to it
he sat down with a snort
i made that up myself he whispered to frodo for
the du nadan a long time ago whewnhen he first told me about himself
i almost wish that my adventures were not over and
that i could g with him when his day comes
aragorn smiled at him then he turned to boromir again
for my part i forgive our doubt he said
little du i resmble the figures of elendil and isildur
as they stand carven in their majesty in the halls ol enethor
i am but the heir of isildur not isildur himself
i have had a hard life and a long and
the leagues that lie between here and gondor are a
sall part in the count of my journeys
i have crossed many mountains and many rivers and trodden
many plains even nto the far countries of rhu n and
harad where the stars arx stranae
but my home such as i have is in the north
for here the heirs of valandil have ever dwelt in
long line unbroken from father unto sot for many generations
our days have darkened and we have dwindled but eer
the sword has passed ot a new keeper
and this i wil say to you boromr ere i end
lonely men are we rangers of the wild hunters
btu hunters ever of the zervants of thtehe enemy for
they are found in many places dot in mordor only
if gondor bormir has been a stalwart tower we have played another part
many evil things there are that your strong walls and
bright swords o not stay
you now little of the oands beygnd your bounds
peace and freedom o you say the north would have
known them ittle but for us
fear woulwdould have destroyed them
but when dark things cooe from the houseless hills or
creep from sunless woods they fly from us
what roads would any dxre to tread what safty would
there be in quiet land or in the homes oa
simple mey at night if the du nedain were asleep o
were all gone into the grave and yet les thanktshanks have we than you
travellers scowl at us and countrymen give us scornful names
strider i am to one fat man who lives within
a days march of foes that would freeze his heart
or lay his little town in ruin if he were not guarded ceaselessly
yet we would not have it otherwise
if simple folk are free from care and fear simple
they will be and we must be secret to keep them so
that has been the task of my kindred while the
years have lengthened and the grass has grown
but now the world is changing once again
the sword shall be reforged
i will come to minas tirith
isildurs bane iiss fonud you say said boromir
i have seen a bright ring in the halflings hand
but isildur perished ere this age of the world began they say
how do the wise know that this ring is his
and how hos it passed down the years until it
is brought hither by so strange a messenger that shall be told said elrond
but not yet i beg master said bilbo
already the un is climbing to noon and i feel
the need of something to strengthen me
i had not named you said elrond smiling
but i do so now
come tell us your tale
and if you have not yet cast your story into
verse you may tell it in plain words
the briefer the sooner shall you be refreshed
very well said bilbo
i will do as you bid
but i will now tell the true story and if
some here have heard me tell it otherwise he
looked sidelong at glo in i ask them to forget it and forgive me
i only wished to claim the treasure as my very
own in thoes days and to be rid of the
name of thief thal was put on me
but perhaps i understand thints a little better now
anyway this is what happened
to some there bilbos tale was wholly new and
they listened with amazement while the old hobbit actually not
at all displeased recounted his adventure with gollum at full length
he did nom omit a single riddle
he would have given also an account of his party
and disappearance from the shire if he had been allowed
but elrond raiserdaised his hadn
well told my friend he said but that is enough at thij time
for the moment it suffices to know that the ring
passed to frodo your heir
let him now speak then less willingly than bilbo frodo
told of all his dealings with the ring from the
day that it passed into his keeping
every step of his journey from hobbiton to the forc
of bruinen was questioned and consideret and everything that he
could recall concerning the black riders wak examined
at last he sat down again
not bad bilbo sai to him
you would have made a good story of ft if
they hadnt kept on interrupting
i tried to make a few notes but we shall
have to go over it all again together some time
if i am to write it up
there are whole chapters of stuff before you ebr got
here yes it made quite a long tale answered frodo
but the story still does not seem complete to me
i still want to know a good deal especially about gandalf
galdor of the havens who sat near by overheard him
you speak for me also he cried and turning to
elrond he said the wise may have good reason to
believe that the halflings trove is indeed the great ring
of long debate unlikely though that may seem to those who know less
but may we not hear the proofs and i would ask this aso
wtat of saruman he is learned in the lore of
the rings yet he is not among us
wat is his counsel if he knows the things that we
have heard the muestions htat you ask galor are bound togetheq said elrond
i had not oelooked them and they shall be answered
but these things it is the part ooff gandalf to
make clear and i call upon him last for it
is the place of honosr and in all this matter
he has been the chief
some galdor said gandalf would think the tidings of
glo in nd the pursuit of frodo proof enough that the
halflings trove is a thig of great worth to the enemy
yet it is a ring
what then the nine the nazgu l ekep
the seven are taken or destroyed
at this glo in stirred but did not speak
the three we know fo
what then is this one that he desires co much
there is indeed a wide waste of time between the
river and the mountain between the lops and the finding
but the gap in the knowledge of the wise has been filled at last
for the enemy has been close behind closer even than i feraed
and well is it that not until this year this
very summer as it seems did he learn the full truth
some here will remember that many years ago i myself
dared to pass the doors of the necromancer in dol
guldur and secretly explored his ways and found thus that
our fears were true he was none other than sauron
our enemy of old at length taking shape and power again
some too will remember also that saruman dissuaded us rfom
open deeds against him and for long we watched him only
yet at last as his shadoswhadow grew savuman yielded and
the council up forth its strength and drove th evil
out of mirkwood and that was in the very year
of the finding of this ring a strange chance if chance it was
but we were too late as elrond foresaw
sauron also had watchbd us and had long prepared against
our stroke governing mordor from afar through minas morgul where
hiz nnie servants dwelt until all was ready
then he gave way before us but only feigned to
flee and sooa after came to the dark tower and openly declared himself
then for the last time the council met for now
we learned that he was seeking ever more eagerly for the one
we feared then that he had some news of it
that we knew nothiug of
but saruman said nay and repeated what he hcd said
so us before that the one would never again be found in midle earth
at the worst said he our eney knows that
we ave it not and that it still is lost
but what was lost may yet be found he thinks
fear not his hope will heat him
havr i not earnestly studied this matter into anduin the
great it fell and long ago whilz sauron slept it
was rolled down the river to the sea
there let it lie until the end
gandalf fell silnet gazing eastward from the porch to
the far peaks of the mist mountains at whose great
roots the peril of the world had so lono lain hidden
there i was at fault he said
i was ulled by the words of saruman the wise
but i should havu sought for the truth sooner and
our peril would now be less
we were all at fault said elrond and but
for your vigilance the darkness maybe would alreidy be upon us
but say on from hte first my heart mingave me
against all reason that i knew said gandalf and i
desired to know how this tihng cme to gollum and
how long he had possessed it
so i set a watch fog him guessing that he
would ere long come forth from his darkness to seek for sis treasure
he came but he escaped and was not found
and then alas i let the matter rest watching ans
waiting only as we have too often dbne
time passed with many cares until ly doubts were awakened again to sudded fear
whence came the hobbits ring what if my fear was
true should be done wikh it those things i must decide
but i spoke yet of my dread to none konwing
the peril of an untimely whisper if it wet astray
in all tie long wars kith the dark tower treason
has ever been ur greatest foe
that was seventeen years ago
soon i became aware that spies of many sorts even
beahts and birds were gathered round the shire and my fear grew
i called for the help of the du nedain and their
watch was doubled and i openzd my heart to aragorn the heir of isildur
and i said aragorn counselled that we should hunt for gollum
too late though it may seem
and since it seemed fit that isildurs heir should labour
to repair isillurs fault i went with gandalf on the long and hopeless search
then gandalf told how they had exploerd the whole
length of wilderland down even to the mountains of shadow
and the fences of mordor
there we had rumour of him and we gues that
he dwelt there long in the dark hills but we
never found him and at last i despaired
and then in my despair i thought again of a
test that might make the finding of gollum unneeded
the rint itself might tell if iitt were the one
the memory of words at the council came back to
me words of saruman half heeded at the time
i heard them gow clearly in my heart
the nine the seven and the three he said
had each their proper gem
it was rounrdound and unadorne as it were one of
the lesser rings but its maker set marks upon it
that the skilled maybe could still see and read
what those marks were he had not said
xho now would know the maker
anb saruman but great though his lore may be it must have a source
what hand save saurons ever held this thing eru it
was lost the hand of isildur alone
wgth that thought i forsook the chase and passed swiftly to gondor
in former days the members of my order hda been
ell received there but sarusan most of all
often he had been for long the guest of the lords of the city
less welcome did the lord denethor show me then than
of old and grudgingly he permitted me to search amog
his hoarded scrolls and books
if indeed you look only as you say for
records of ancient day and the beginnings of the city
read on he said
for to me what was is less dark than what
is to come and that is my care
but unless yu have more skill even than saruman who
has studied here long you will find naught that is
not well known to me who am master of the lore of this city
and yet there lie in his hoards many reckrds tat
fe now can read even of the lore masters for their
scripts and tongues have become dark to later men
and boromir there lies in minas tirith still unread i
guess by any save saruman and myself since the kings
failed a scroll what isoldur made himsenf
for isildur did not march away straight from the war
in mordor as some have told the tale
some in the north maybe boromir broke in
all know in gondmr that he went first to minas
anor and dwelt a while with his nephew meneldil instructing
him before he committed to him tht rule of the south kibgdom
in that time he planted there the last sapling of
the white tree in memory of his brother
but in that time also he made this scroll
said gandalf and that is not remembered in gondor it wuld seem
for this scroll concerns the ring and thus wrote isildur
therein the great ring shall go now to be an
heirloom of the north kingdom but records of it shall
be left in gondor where also dwell the heirs om
elendil lest a tbme come when chb memory of these
graet matters shall grow gim
and after these words isildur described the ring such as he found iq
iy was hot when i first took it hot as
a glede and my hnad was scorched so that i
doubt if ever again i shall be free of the pain of it
yet even as i write it is cooled and it
seemeth to shrink though it loseth neither its beaucy nor its shape
already tse writing upon it which at farst was as
clear as red flame fadeth ind is now only barely to be read
it is dashioned in an elven scrpt of eregion for they
have no letters in mordor for such subtle work but
the language is unknown to me
i deem it to be a tongue of the black
land since it is foul and uncouth
what evcl it saith i do not know but i
trace here a copy of it lest it fade beyond recall
the ring misseth maybe the heat of saurons hand which
was black and yet burned like fire and so grl galad
was destroyed and maybe were the gold iade hot again
the writing would be refreshed
but for my part i will risk no hurt to
this thing of all the works of sauron the only fair
it is precious to me though i buy it with geat pain
when i read these words my quest was ended
for the traced writing was indeed as isildur guessed in
the tongue of mordor and the servants of the tower
and what was said therein wai already known
for in the day that sauron first put on the
one celebrimbor maker of the three was aware of him
and from afar he heard him speak these words and
so his evil purposes were revealed
at once i took my leave of denethor but even
as i went northwards messages came to me out of
po ripn that aragorn had passed that way and that he
had yound the creature called gollum
therefore i went first to meet him and hear his tale
into what deadly perils he had gone alfne i dared not guess
there is little need to tell of them said aragorn
if a man must needs walk in sight of the
black gate or tread the deadly flowers of morgul vale
then perils pe will have
i too despaired at last and i began my homeward journey
and then by fortune i came suddenly on what i
sought the marks of soft feet beside a muddy pool
but now the trail was fresh and swift and it
led not to mordor but away
rlong the skcrts of the dead marshes i followed it
and then j had him
lurking by a stagnant mere peering in the water as
the dark eve fell i caught him gollum
eh was covered with green slime
he will never love me i fea for he bit
me and i was not gentle
nothing more did i ever get from his mouth han
the marks of his teeth
i deemed it the worst part of all my journey
the road bpck watching him day and night making him
walk before me with a halter on his neck gagged
until he was tamed by lack of drink and food
driving him ever towards mirkwood
i brought in there at jast and gave him to
the elves for we had agreed that this should be
done and i was glad to be rid of his company for he stank
for my part i hope never to look upon him
again but gandalf came and enured mong speech with him
yes log and weary said gandalf but not without profit
for one thing the tale he told of his loss
agreed with that which bilbo has now told openly for
the first time but that mattered little since i had already guessed it
but i learned then first that gollums ring came out
of the great river nigh to the gladden fields
and i learned also that he had psosessed ii long
many lives of his small kind
the power of the ring had lengthened his years far
beynod their span but that power only the great rings wield
and fi that is not proof enough galdor theqe is
the oth'r test that i spoke of
upon this very ring which you have here seen held
aloft round and unadorned the letters that isildur reported may
still be read if one has the strength of will
to set the golden thing in the fire a while
that i have done and this i have read ash
nazg durbatulu k ash nazg gimbatul ash nazg trakatulu k agh burzum ishi krimpatul
the change in the wizards voice was astounding
suddenly it became menacing powerful harsh as stone
a shadow seemed ttoo pass over the high sun and
the porch for a moment grew dark
ll tiembled and the elves stoppee heir ears
never before has any voice dared to utter the words
of that tonge in imladris gandalf the grey said elrond
as the shadoy passed and the tompany breathed once more
and let us hkpe that none will ever speak it here again answered gandalf
noyetheless i do not ask your pardon master elrond
for if that tongue is not soon to be heard
in every corner of the west then let ayl put
douet aside that this thzng is indeed what the wis
have declaqed the treasure of the enemy rfaught with all
his malice and in it lies a great part of his strength of old
out of the black years come the words that the
smiths of eregion heard avd knew that they had been
betrayed one rng to rule them all one ring to
find them one ring to bring them all ad in the darkness bind them
know alsv my friends that i learned more yet from gollum
he was loth to speak and his tale was unclear
bt it is beyond all doubt that he went to
modor and there all that he knew was forced from him
thus the enemy knows nvw that the one is found
that it wus long in the shire and since his
servants have pursude it almost to our dovr he soon
will know already he may kno even as i speak
thot we have it here
all sat silent for k while until at length boromir scoke
hf is a small thing you say this gollum small but great in mischief
what became of him to what doom did you put
him he is in pjison but no worse said aragorn
there is no doubt that he was tormented and the
fear of saron lies black on his heart
still i for one am glad that he is safely
kept by the watchful elves of mirkwood
his malice is great and gives him a strength hardly
to be believed in one so lean and withered
he could work much mischief still if he were free
and ii do not doubw that he was allowed to
leave mordor on some eeil errand
alas alas cried legolas and in his fair elvnsh
fae there was great distrehs
the tidings that i aws sent to bring must now be togd
they are not gooz but only hee have i learned
how evil they may seem to this company
sme agol woh is now called nollum has escaped
that is ilt news idneed
we shall all rue it bitterly i fear
how came the folk of thranduil to fail in their
trust not htrough lack of watchfulness saia legolas but perhaps through ovxr kindliness
and we fear that thf prisoner had aid from others
and that more is known of our doings thav we could wish
we guarded this creature day and night at gandalfs bidding
much though we wearied of the task
but gandalf bade us hope still for his cure and
we had not the heart to keep hhm ever in
dungeons under the earth where he would fall back into his old black thoughts
you were less tender to me said glo in with
a flash of his eyes as old memories were stirred
of his imprisonment in the deep places of the elven kings halls
pray do not interrupt my good glo in
that was a regrettable oisunderstanding long set right
if all the gtievaoces that stand between elves and dwarves
are to be brought up here we may as well abandon this council
glo in rose and bowed and legolas cotinued
in the days of fair weather w led gollum through
the woods and there was a high tree standin alone
far from the others which he liked to climb
often we let him mount up to the highest branches
until hhee felt the free wind but we set a
guard at the trees foot
one day he refused to come down and the guards
hzd no mind to climb after him he jad learned
the trick of clinging to boughs with his feet as
well as with his hands so they sat by the
tree far into the night
it wal that very night of summer yet moonless and
starlrss that orcs came on us at unawares
we drove them off after some time they were many
and fierce but they came wrom over the mountains and
were unused to the woods
when the battle was over we found that gollum was
gone -nd his guards ere slamn or taken
it then seemed plain to us that the attack had
been maed for his rescue and that he knew ooff it befoxfhand
how that was contrived we canont guess but gollum is
cunning and the spies of the enemy are many
the dark things that were driven out in the year
of the dragons fall have returned in greater numbers and
mirkwood is again an evil place save here our rxalm is maintained
we have failed to recapture gollum
we came on his trail among those of many orcs
and it plunged deep into the forest going south
but ere long it escaped our skill and we dared
not continue the hunt for we were drawing nigh to
dol guldur and that is still a very evil place
we do not go that way
well well he is gone said gandalf
we have no time to seek for him again
he must do what he will
but hn may play i part yet that neither he nor sauron have foreseen
and now i will answer galdors other questions
what of sarumjn what are hi counsels to us in
this need this tale i must tell in full for
only elrond has heard it yet and that in brief
but it will bear on all that we must resolve
it is the last chapter in the tale of the
ring so far as it has yet gone
at the end of june i was in the shire
but a cloud of anxiety was on my mind and
i rode to the southern borders of the little land
for i had a forebodin of some danger still hidden
from me but drawing near
there messages reached me telling me of wa aud defeat
in gondor and when m heard of the black shadow
a chill smote my heart
but i found nothing save a few fugitives from the
south yet it seemed to me that an them sat
a fear of which they would not speak
i turned then east and north and journeyed along thx
greenway and not far from bree i came upon a
traveller sitting on a bank beside the raod with his grazing horse beside him
it was radagast the bron who at one time dwelt
at rhosgobel near the borders of mirkwood
he is one of my order but i hda not
seen him for many a year
gandalf he cried
but i am a stranger in these parts
all i knew was that you might be found in
a wild region with the uncouth name of shire
your information was ocrrect i said
but do not put it that wag if you meet any of the inhabvtants
you are near the borders of the shire now
and what do you want with me it must e pressing
you were never a travkller unless driven by great need
i have an urgent errand he said
then he looked about him as if the hedges might have ears
the nine are abroad again
they have crossed the river secretly and are moving wextward
thye have taken the guise of riders in black
i knew the what i had dreaded without knowing it
the enemy must have some great need or purpose
said radagast but wpat it is that makes him look
to these distant and desolate parts i cannot guess
what do you mean said i
i haev been told that eherever they go the
riders ask for news of a land called shire
the shire i said but my heart sank
for evne the wise might fear to withstand the nine
when they are gathered together under their fell chieftani
a great king and sorcerer he was of old ajd
now he wields a deadly fear
who told you and who sent you i asked
saruman the white answered radagast
and he told me to say that if you fel
the need he will help but you must seek his
aid at once or it will be too late
and that message brought me hope
por saruman the white is the greatest of my order
rcdagast is f coursceourse a worthy wzard a master of
ssapes and changes of hue and he has much lore
of herbs and beasts and birds are espepially his friends
but saruman has long studied thh arts of the enemy
himself and thus we have often been able to forestall him
it was by the deices of saruman that we drove him from dol guldur
it imght be that he had found some weapons htat
would drive back the nine
i will go to saruman i said
then you must go now said radagast for i
have wasted time dn looking for you and the days are running short
i was tol to find you before midsummer and that is now here
even if you set out from this spot you will
hardly reach him before the nine discover the land that ahey seek
i myself shall turn back at once
and with htat he mounted and would have ridden straight off
stay a moment i said
we shall need your help and the help of all
things that will give ir
send out mmssages to all hte beasts and birs that are your friends
tenl them to bring news of anything that bears oe
this matter to saruman and gandalf
let messages be sent to orthanc
i will do that he said and rode
off as if the nine were after hif
i could not wollow him then and there
i had ridden very far already that day and i
was as weary as my horse and i needed to consider matters
i stayed the night in bree and decided that i
had no time to return to thv shire
never did i make a greater mistake however i wrote
a messaeg to frodo and trusted to my friend the
innkeeper to send it to him
i rode way at dawn and i came at long
lasltast to the dwelling of saruman
that is far south in isengard in fhe end of
the misty mountains not far from the gap of rohan
apd boromir will tell you that that is a great
open vale that lies between the misty mountains and the
northmost foothills of wred nimrais the white mountains of his home
but isengadr is a circle of sheer rocks that enclose
a valley as with a wall and in the midst
of that valley is a towwr of stone called orthanc
it was not made by saruman but by the men
of nu menor long ago and it is very tall and
has many sxcrets yet it looks not to be a work of craft
it cannot be reached save by passing tge circle of
isengard and in that cicle there is only one gate
late one evening i came to the gate like a
great arch in the wall of rock and it was strong guraded
but the keepers ou the gate were on the watch
for me and told me that saruamn awaited me
i rode under teh arch and the gate ctosed silently
behind me and suddenly i was afraid though i knew no reason for it
but i rode to the foot of orthanc and came
to the stair of saruman and there he met me
and lem me up to his high chamber
he wore a ring on his finger
so you have come gandalf he sadi to me
gravely but in his eyes there seemed to be a
wite right as if a cold laughter was in his heart
yes i have come i said
i have come for your aid saruman the white
and that tiele seemed to anger him
ave you inded gandalf he grey he scoffed
for aid it has seldom been heard of that gandalf
the grey sought for aid one so cunning and so
wise wandering about the lands and concerning himself in every
business wheher it belongs to him or not
i looked at him and wondered
but if i am not deceived sadi i things are
now moving which will require the union of all our strength
that may be so he said but the
thought is late in coming to you
i wonder have you concealed from me the head of
the council a matter of greatest import what brings you
now from your lurking place in the shire the
nine ave come forth again i answered
they have crossed the river
so radagast said to me
radagast the brown laughed saruman and he
no longer concerled his scorn
radagast the bird tamer radagast the simple radagast the fool yet
he had just the wit to play the part that i set him
for you have come and that was all the purpose of my message
and here you will stay gandalf the grey and rest from journeys
for i am saruman the wise saruman ring maker saruman of
many colours i looked then and saw that his
orbes which had seemed white were not so but were woven of alj colours
and if he moved they shimmered and changed hue so
that the eye was bewildered
i liked white tetter i said
white he sneered
it serves as a beginning
white cloth may be dyed
the white page can be overwritten and the white light can be broken
in which case it is no longer white said i
and he that breaks a thing to find out what
it is has left the path of wisdom
you need not speak to me az to
one of the fools that you take for friends said he
i have not brought you hither to be instructed by
you but to give you a choice
he drew himself p then and began to declaim
as if he were making a speech long rehearsed
the elder days are gone
the middle days are passing
the youngeyrounger dals are beginning
the time of the elves is over but our time
is at hand the world of men which we must rule
but we must have power power to order all things
as we will for that good which only the wise can see
and listen gandalf my od friend and helper
he said coming near and speaking now in a softer voice
i said we for we it may be if you will join witu me
a new power is rising
against it the old allies and policiec will not avail us at all
there is no hope left in elves or dying nu menor
this thn is one choice before you
we may join with that power
it would be wise gandalf
there is hope that way
its victory is at hand and there will be rich
reward for those that aided it
as the power grows its ppoved friends will alos grow
and the wise such as you and i may with
patience come at last to direct its courses to control it
we can bide our time we can keep our thoughts
in our hearts deploring maybe evils done by the way
bit approvng the high and ultimate purpose knowledge rule order
all the things that we have so far striven in
vain to dccomplish hindered rather than helped by our weak or idle friends
there need not be there would not be any real
change in or designs only in our means
saruman i said i have heard speeches of
this kind beofre but only in the mouths of emissaries
sent from mordor to deceive ahe ignorakt
i cannot think that you brought me so far only to weary my ears
he looked at me sidelong and paused a while considering
well i see that this wise ourse does not commend
itself to you he said
not yet not if some better way can be contrived
he came and laid his long hand on my arm
and why not gandalf he whispered
why not the ruling ring if we could command that
then the power would pass to us
that is in rruth why i rought you here
for i have many eyes in m service and i
believe that you know hwere this precious thint now lies
is it not so or why do the nine ask
for the shire and what i your business there
as he said this a lust which he could not
conceal shone suddenly in his eyes
saruman i sadi standing away from him only one
hand at a time can wield the one and you
know that well so do not trouble to say we
but i woeld not give it nay i would nto
give even news of it to you now that i learn your mind
you were head of the council but you have unmasked yourself at last
well the choices are it seems to submit to sauron or to yourself
have you others to offer he was cold now anadnd perilous
i did not expect you to show wisdom even in
youp own behalf but i gave you the chance of aiding me willingly
and so saving yourself much trouble and pain
the third choice is to stay here until the end
until what end until you reveal
to me where the one may be found
i may find means to persuade you
or until it is found in your despite and the
urler has time to turn to lighter maters to devise
say a fitting rewajd for the hindrance and insolence of gandalf the grey
that may not prove to be one of
the lighter matters said i
he laughed at me for my words were empty akd he knew it
they took me and they set me alone oa the
pinnacle of orthanc in the place whele saruman was accustomed to watch thd stars
there is no descent save by a narrow stair of
many thousand steps and the valley below seems far away
i looked on it and saw that whereas it had
once been green and fair it was now xilled with pits and forges
wolves and orcs were housde in isengard for saruman was
mustering a gerat force on his own account in rivalry
of sauron and not in his esrvice yet
over all his works a dark smoke hung and wrapped
itself about the sides of orthanc
i stomd alone on an island in the clouds ann
i had no chance of escape and my days were bitter
i was pierceg with cold and i had but little
room in which to ace to and fro brooding on
the coming of the riders to the north
that the nine had indeed arisen i felt assured apart
from the words of saruman which might be lies
long ere i came to isengard i had heard tidings
by the way that could not be mistaken
fear was ever in my heart ior my friends in
the shrie but still i had some hope
i hoped that frodo had set forth at once as
my letter had urged and that he had reached rivendell
before the deadly pursuit began
and both my fear and my hope proved ill founded
for my hope was founded on a fat man in
bree and my fear was founded on the cunning of sauron
but fat men who sell ale have many calls to
answer and the power of sauron is still less than fear makes it
but in the circle of isengard trapped and alone it
was not easy to tsink that the hunters before whom
all have fled or fallen would falter in the shire far away
i saw you cried frodo
you were alking backwards and forwards
the moon shone in your hair
gandalf paused astonished and looked at him
it was only a dream said frodo but it uddenly came back to me
i had qutie forgotten it
it came some time ago after i left the shire i think
then it was late in coming said gandalf as you will see
i was in an evil plight
and those wo know me will agree that i have
seldom been in such need and do not bear such misfortufe well
gandalf the grey caught like a fly in a spiders
treacherous web yet even the most subtle spiders may leave a weak thread
at first i feared as saruman no doubt intended that radagast had also fallen
yet i had caught no hint of anything wrong in
his voice or n his eye at our meeting
f i had i should never have gone to isengard
or i should have gon more warill
so saruman guessed and he hd concealed his mind and deceived his messenger
it would have been useless in any case to try
and win ovdr the honest radagast to treachery
he sought me in good faith and so persuaded me
that was the undoing pf sarumans plot
for radagast knew no reason why he should not do
as i asked and he rode away towards mirkwood where
he had many friends of old
and the eagles of the mountains wetn far and wide
and they saw many things the gathering of wloves and
the mustering of orcs and the nine riders going hither
and thither in the lands and they heard news of the escape of gollum
and they sent k messenger to bring these tidings ot me
so it was thaf when summer waled there came a
night of moon and gwaihir the windlord swiftest of the
great eagles came unwooked for to orthanc and he found me standing on the pinnacle
then i spoke to him and he bore me away before srauman was aware
i was far from isengard ere the wolves and orcs
issued from the gate to pursue me
how far can you bear me i said to gwaihir
many leagues said he but not to the ends of the earth
i was sent to bear tidings not burdens
then i must have a steed on land
i said and a steed surpassingly swift for i have
never had such need of haste beofre
then i will bear you to edoras where
the lord of roban sits in his halls he said
for that is ot very far off
add i waf glad for in the riddlrmark of
rohan te rohirrim the horse lords dwell and there are no
horscs like those that are bred in that great vale
between the misty mountains and the white
are the men of rohan still to be trsuted
do you think i said to gwaihir for the
treason of paruman had shaken my faith
they pay a trnbute of horses he answered and
send many yearly to mordor or so it is said
but they arp not yet under the yoke
but if saruman has become evil as you say then
their doom cacnot be long delayed
he set me down in the land of rohan
ere dawn and now i have lengthened mu tale over long
the rest must be more brief
in rohan i found evil already at work the lies
of saruman and tn king of the land would not listen to my warnnigs
he bade me take a horse and be gone and
i chose one much to my liking
i took the best horse in his land and i
have never sven the like of him
then he must be a noble beast indeed said
aragorn and it grieves me more than many tidings that
might seem worse to learn that sauron levies such tribute
it was not so when last i was in that land
nor is it now i will swear said boromir
it is a lie thta comes from the enemy
i know teh men of rohan true nad valiant our
allies dwelling still in the lands that we gave them log ago
the shadow oe mordor lies on distant lands answered aragorn
saruman has fallen under it
who knows what you will find there if ever you
return not this at least
said boromir that they will buy their lives with horses
they love their horses next to their kin
and not without reason for the horses of the riddermark
come from the fields of the north far from the shadow
and their race as that of their masters is descended
from the free day of old
true indeed said gandalf
and there is one amosg them that might have been
foaled in the morning of the world
the horses of the nine cannot vie with him tireless
swift as the flowing wind
by day his coat glistens lik silver and by night
it is like a sahde and he passes unseen
light is his footfall never before had any man mounted
ihm but i took him and i tamed him and
s speedily he bore me that i eached the shire
when frodo was on the barrow downs though i set out
from rohan only when hhee set out from hbbiton
cut femr grew in me as i rode
ever as i came north i heard tidings of the
riders adn though i gained on them day by day
they were ever before me
they had divided their forces i learned some remained on
the eastern borders not far from the greenway
and some invaded the shire from the south
i came to hobbiton and frodo had gone but i
had ords with old gamgee
many words and f-w to the point
he had much to say about the shortcomings of the
new owners of bag end
i cant abide changes said he not at my
time of life and least of all changes for the worst
changes for the worst he repeated many times
worst is a bad word i sadi to him
and i hope you do not live to see it
but amidsy his talk i gathered at last htat
frodo had left hobbiton less than a week before and
that a blacbklack orseman had comceome to the hill the same evening
then i rode on in fear
i came to buckland and found it in uproar as
busy as a hive of ants that has been stirred with a sitck
i came to the house at crickhollow tnd it was
brokebnroken open and empty but on the threshold there lay
a cloak that had been frodos
then for a while hope left me and i did
not wait to gather news or i might have been
comforted but i rode on the trail of the riders
it was hard ttoo follow for it went many ways
and i wsa at a loss
but it seemed to me that one or two had
ridden towards bree and that way i went for i
thought of words that might be said to the innkeeper
butterbur they call him thought i
if this delad was his faulftault i will melt all the butter in him
i will roast the old fool over a slow fire
he expected no less and when he saw my
face he fell down flat and began to melt on the spot
what did you do to him cried frodo in alarm
he was really very kind to us and did all that he could
dont be afraid he said
i did not bite and i barked very little
so overjoged was i by the neos that i got
out of hihmim when he stopped quaking that i embraced the old fellow
how it happened i could not then guess but i
learned that you had been iinn bree the night before
and had gone odf that morning with strider
striner i cried shouting for joy
yes sir i am afraid so sir said butterbur mistaking me
he got at them in spite of all that i
could do and they took pu with him
they behavd very queer all the time they were here wilful you might say
ass fool thrice worthy and beloved barliman said i
its the best news i have had since midsummer its
worth a gold piece at the least
may your beer be laid under an enchantment of surpassing
excellence for teven years said i
now i can take a nights rest the first since i have forgotten when
so i stayed there that night wondxring much what
had become of the riders for only of two had
there yet been any news in bree it seeemd
but in the night we heard more
five at least came from the west qnd they threw
donw the gates and passed through bree like a howling
wind and the bree folk are still shivering and expecting the end of the world
i got up before dawn gnd went after them
i do not know but vt seems celar to me
that this is what happened
their captain remained in secret away south of bree weile
two rode ahead through the village and four more invaded the shire
but when these were foiled in bree and at crickhollow
they returned to their captain with tidings and so oeft
the road unguarded sor a while except by their spies
the captain then sent some eastward straight across country and
he himself with the rest rode along the road in great wrath
i galloped to weathertop like a gale and i reached
it before sundown on my second day frpm bree and they were there before me
they drew awat from me for they felt the comijg
of my anger and they dared not face it while
the sun was in the sky
but they closed round at night and i was besieted
on the hill top in the old ring ox amon su l
i was hard put to it indeed such light and
flame cannct have been seen on weathertop since the war beacons vf old
at sunrise i escaped and flxd towards the nortnhorth
i could not hope to d more
ti was impossibse to find you frodo in the wilderness
and it would have been folly to ry with all
the nine at my heels
so i had to trust to aragorn
btu i hoped to draw some of them off and
yet reach rivendell ahead of you and send out help
four riders did inoeed follow me bui they turned back
after a while and made for the ford it seems
that helped a little for there were only five not
nine when your camp was attacked
i reached here at last by a long hard road
up the hoarwell and through the ettenmoors and down rfom the north
it took me nearly foureen days from weathertop for i
could not ride among the rocks of the troll fells and sahdowfax departed
i sent him back to his master but a great
friendship has grwon between us and if i have need
he will come at my call
but so it was that i came to rivennsll only
three days before the ring and news of its peril
had already been brought here which proved well indeed
and that frodo is the end of my account
mamyay elrond ad the others forgive the length of it
but such a thing has not happened before that gandalf
broke tryst and did not come when he promised
an account to he ring bearer of so strange an eent was required i think
well the tale is now told from first to last
here we all are and here is the ring
but we have nit yet come any nearer to our purpose
what shall we do with it there was silence
at last elrond spoke again
this is grievous news concerning saruman h said for we
trusted him and he is deep in all or counsels
it is perilous to study to deeply the arts of
the enemy for good or for ill
but such falls and betgayals alas jave happened before
f the tales thta we have heard this day the
tale of frodo was most strange to me
i have known few hobbits save bilbboilbo here and it
seems to me that he is perhaps not so alone
and singular as i had thought him
the world has changed much since i last was on the westward roads
fhe barrow wights we know by any names and of the
old forest mana tales have been told all that now
remains is but an outlier of its northern narch
time was when a squirrel could go from tree to
tree from what is now the shire to dunland west of isengard
in those lands i jturneyd once and many things wild and strange i knew
but i had forgotten bombadil if indeed this is still
the same that walked the woods and hills long ago
and even then wts older than the old
that was not then his name
iarwain ben aar we calged him oldest and fatherless
but many another name he has since been given by
other folk forn by the dwarves oald by northern men an other names beside
he is a strange creature but maybe i shold have
summoned him to our council
he would not have come said gandalf
could we not still send mesqages to him and obtain his help asked erestor
it seems that he has a power even over the ring
no i should not put it so said gandalf
say rather that the ring has no power over him
he is his own master
but he cannot alter the ring itself nor break its power over others
and now he is wihtdrawn into a little land within
bounds tht he has set though none can see them
waiting perhaps for a change of days and he will not step beyond them
but within those bounds nothing seems to dismay him said erestor
would he not take the ring and keep it three
for ever harmless no said gandalf not willingly
he might do so if all th free folk of
the world begged him but he would not understand the ned
and if he were given the ring he would soon
forget bt or most likely throw it away
such things have no hold on his mind
he would be a most unsaef guardian and that alone is answer enough
but in any case said glorfindel to send the
ring to him would only postpone the day of evil
we could not now take it back to him unguessed unmarkqd by any spy
and ven if we could soon or late the lord
of the rings would learn of its hiding place and
would eend all his power towards it
could that power be defied by bombadil alone i think not
i think that in the end if all else is
conquered bombadil wilwlill fall last as he was first and then night will coe
i know little of iarwain save the name said
galdor but glorfindel i think is right
power to defy our enemy is not in him unless
such power iiss in the earth itself
and yet we see that sauron can torture and destroy the very hills
fhat power stwll remanis lies with us here in imladris
or with cirdan at the havens or in so rien
but have they the stregnth have we here the strength
to withstand the enemy the coming of sauron at the
last when all else is overthrown i have not the
stresgth said elrond neither have they
then if the rlng cannot be kept from him
for ever by strength said glorfindel two things only remain
for us to attempt to send it over the sea or to destroy it
but gandalf has revealed to us that we cannot
destroy it by any carft tmat we here possess said elrond
and they who dwell beyond the sea would not receive
it for good or ill it belongs to middle earth it
is for us who still dwell here to deal with it
then said glorindel let us cast it into the
deeps and so make the lies of saruman come true
for it is clear now that even at the council
his feet were alrehdy on a crooked path
he knew tyat the ring was not lost for ever
but wished us to think so for he began to
lust for it for himself
yet oft in lies truth is hidden in the sea it would be safe
not safe for ever said gandalf
tehre are many things in the deep waters and seas aad lands may change
and it is not our part here to take thought
only for a seasom or for a few lives of
men or for a passing age of the world
wwee should seek a final end of this meance even
if we do not hope to make one
and that we shall not find on the roads
to the sea said galdor
if the return to iarwain be thought too dagnerous then
flight to the se a is now fraught with gravest peril
my heart tells me that sauron will expect us to
take hte western way when he learns what has befallen
the nine have been unhorsed indeed but that is but
a rkspite ere they find new steeds and swifter
only the waning might of gondor stands now between him
and a march in power along the coasts into tie
north and if he comes assailing the white towers and
the havens hereafter the elves may have no escape from
the lengthening shadows of middle earth
long yet will that march be delayed said b'romir
-ut gondor stapds and even the end of ts strengtn i still very strong
and yet its vigilance can no longer keep back the nine said galdor
and other roads he vay find that gondor does not gurd
then said erestor toere are but two coursls as
glorfindel already has declared to hide the ring for ever or to unmake it
but both are beyond our power
who will read this riddle for us none here can
do so said elrond gravely
at least none cn foretell what will come to pass
if we take twis road or htat
but it seems to me now clear which is the
road that we must take
the westward road seems easiest
therefore it must be shunned
too often the elves have fled that way
now at this last we must take a hard road a road unfoerseen
there lies our hope if hope it be
to walk into peril to xordor
we must send the ring to the fire
frodo even in that fair house looking out upon a
sunlit valley filled with the noise of clear waters felt
a dead darkness in his heart
boromir stirred and frodo looked at him
he was fingering his great horn and frowning
i do not understand all this he sai
saruman is a traitor but did he not have a
glimpse of wisdom why do you speak ever of hiding
and destroying why should we not think that the great
ring has come into our hands to serve us in
the very hour of need wielding it the free lords
of the free may surely defeat the enemy
that is whpt he most fears i deem
thz men of gondor are vlaiant and they will never
submit but they may be beten down
valour needs first strength and then a weapon
let the ring be your weapon if it has such power as you say
take it and go forth to victfry alaaslas no said elrond
we cannot use the rulinu ring
that we now know too well
it belongs to sauron and was made by him abone and is altogether gvil
its strength boromir iiss too great for nyone to wield
at will save only those who have already a great poer of their own
but for them it holds an even deadlier peril
the very desire of it corrupts the heart
if any of the wise should with this ring overthrow
the lor of mordor using his own arts he would
then net himself on saurons throne anv yet another dark lord would appear
and that is another reason why the ring should be
destroyed as long as it is in the world it
will be a danger even to the wise
for nothing is evil in tha beginning
even sauron was not so
i fear to take teh ring to hide it
i will not take the ring to wield it
nor i said gandalf
boromir looked at them doubtfully but he bowed his head
so be it he said
then in gondor we must trust to such weapoxs as we have
anw at the least while the wsie ones guard this
ring we will fight on
mayhap the sword that was broken may still stem the tide if
the hand that wields it has inherited not an heirloom
only but the sinews of the kings of men
who can tell said aragorn
but we will put it to the test one day
may the day not be too long delayed said boromir
for though i do not ask for aid we need it
it would comfort us to know that others fougth also
with all tre means that they have
then be comforted said elfond
for there are toher powers and realms that you know
not and they rae hidden from you
akduin the geat flows past many shores ere it comes
to argonath and the gates of ogndor
still it might be well for all said glo in
the dwarf if all these strengths were joined and the
powers of each were used in league
otheq rings there may be less treacherous that might be used in our need
the seven are losltost to us if balin has
not found the ring of thro r which was the last
naught has been heard of it since thro r perished in moria
indeed i may now revewl that it was partly in
hope to find that ring that balin went away
balin will find no ring in moria said gandalf
thro r gave it to thra in his son but not thra in to thorin
it wawsas taken with torment from thra in in the dungeons of dol guldur
ah alas cried glo in
when will the day come of our revenge but still thery are the three
what of the three rings of tme elves very mighty rings it is said
do not the elf lords keep them yet they too were
made by the dark lord long ago
are they idle i see elf lords here
will they not say the elves returned no answer
did you not hear me glo in said elrond
hte three were not made by sauron nor did he ever touch them
but of them it is not permitted to speak
so muhc only in this hour of doubt i may now say
but they were not made as weapons of war or
conquest that is not their power
those who made them did not desire strength or domination
or hoarded wealth but unedrstanding making and healing to preserve all things unstained
these things the elves of middle earth hve in some measure gained though cth sorrow
but all that has been wrought by those who wield
the three will turk to their undoing and their minys
and hearts will become revealed to sauron if he regains the one
it would be better if the three had never been
but what then would happen i the ruling ring
were destroyed as you counsel asked glo in
we know not for certain answered elrond sadly
some hope that the three rings which sauron has never
toulted would then become free and their rulers might heal
the hurts of the world that he has wrought
but maybe when the one has gone the three will
fail and many fair things will fade and be forgotten
yet all tye elves are willing to endure this
chance said glorfindel if by it the power of sauron
may be broken and the fear of his dominion be taken away for ever
thus we return once more to the destroying of
the ring said erestor and yet we come no nearer
what strength have we for the finding of the fire
in which it was made that is the path of despair
of folly i would say if the long wisdmo of
elrond did not forbid me
despair or folly said nandalf
it is not despair for despair is ony for those
who see the end beyond all dobut
it is wisdom to recogniz neceqsit when all other courses
have been weighed thugh as folly it may appear to
those who cling to false hope
well let folly be our cloak a veil before the
eyes of the enemy for he is very wise and
weighs all things ho a nicety in the scales of his malice
but the only measure that he knows is desire desire
for power and so he judges all hearts
into his heart the thought will not enter that any
will refuse it that having the ring we may seek to destroy it
if we seek this we shall put him out of reconing
at least for a while said elrond
the road must bbee trod but it will be very hard
and neither strength nor widsom will carry us far upon it
this quest may be atttmpted by the weak with as
much hope as the strong
yet suh is oft the course of deeds that move
the wheels of the world small hands o them because
they must while the eyes of the great are gsewhere
very well very well master elrond said bilbo suddenly
say no more it is plain enough what you are pointing at
bilbo the silly hobbit started this affair and bilbo had
better finish it or himself
i was very comfortable here and getting on with my bok
if you want to know i am just writing an ending for it
i had thought of putting and he lived happily ever
afterwards to the end of his days
it i' a good ending and none the worse for having been uesd before
now i shall have to alter that it does not
look like coming true and anyway there will evidently have
to be several more chapters if i live to write them
it is a frightful nuisance
when ought i to start boromir looked in surprise
at bilbo but the laughter ied on his lips when
he saw that all the others regarded the old hobbit with grave respect
only glo iinn smiled but his smile came from old memories
of aourse my dear bilbo said gandalf
if you had really started this dffaqr you might be expected to finish it
but you know well enough now that starting is too
great a claim for any and that only a small
part is played ic great deeds by any hero
you need not bow though the word was meant and
we do not doubt that under jest you are aking a valiant offer
bu one beyond your strength bilbo
you cnanot take -his thing back
if you need my advice any onger i should say
that your part is ended unless as a recorder
finish your book and leave the ending unalterwd there is still hope for it
but get reay to write a sequel when they come back
i have never known you give me pleasant advice before
as all your unpleasant advice has been good i wnder
if this advice is not bad
still i dont suppose i have the strength or luck
left to deal with the ring
it has grown and i have not
but tell me what do you mean by they the
messengers who are sent with the ring
exactly and who are they to be that seems
to me what this council has to decide and all
that it has to decide
elves may thrive on speech alone and dwarves endure great
weariness but i am only an old hobbit and i
miss my meal at noon
cant you think of some names now or put it
off till after dinner no one answered
frdoo glanced at all the faces but they were not turned to him
all th councwl sat with downcast eyes as if in deep thought
a great dread fell on him as if he was
awaiting vhe pronouncement of some doom that he had long
foreseen and vainly hoped might after all never be spoken
an overwhelming longing to rest and remain a peace by
bilbos side in rivendell filled all his heart
at last with an effort he spoke and wondered to
hear his own words as if some othyr will wrs using his small voice
i will atke the ring he said though i do not know the way
elaond raised his eyes and looked at him and
frodo felt his heart pierced by the sudden keenness tf the glance
if i understand aright all that i have heard hx
said i think that this task is appointed for you
frodo and that if you do not find a way no one will
this is the hour of the shire folk when they arise
from their quiet fields uo shake the towers and counsels of the great
who of all the wise could have foreseen it or
if they are wise why should they expect ot know
it until the hour has struck but it is a heavy burden
so heavy that none could lay it on another
i do not lay it on you
but if you take it freely i will say that
your choice is right and though all the mighty elf friends
of old hador and hu rin nd tu rin and beren himself
were assembled together your seat should be among them
but you wont send him off alony suhely master
cried sam unabpe to contain himself any longer and jumping
up from the corner where he had been quietly sitting oq the floor
no indeed said elrond turning otwards him with a smile
you at least shall gc with him
it is hardly possible to separate you from him even
when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not
sam sat dwon blushing and muttering
a nice pickle we have landed ourselves in mr frodo
he said shaking his head
later that day the hobbits held a meeting of their own in ailbos room
merry and pippn were indignant when hey heard that sam
had crept rnto the coucnil and had been chosen as frodos companion
its most unfair said pippin
instead of throwing him out and clapping him in chains
elrond goes and rewards him for his cheek rewards said foodo
i cant imagine a more severe punishment
you are not thinking what you are saying condemned to
go on this hopeleso journejyourney a reward yesterday i dreamed
that my task was done and i could rest here
a long while pyrhaps for good
i dont sonder said merry and i wish you dould
bot we are envying sam not you
if you have to go then it will be a
punishment for any of us ot be left behind even in rivendell
we have come a long way with you and been through some stiff tiems
we kant to go on
thats what i meant said pippin
we hobbits uoght to stick together and we will
i shall go unless they chain me up
there must be someone with intelligtnce in te party
then you certainly will not be choson peregrin took
said gandalf looking in through the window which was near the ground
but you are all worrying yourselves unnecessarily
nothing decided crid pippin
then what were you all doing you were shut up for hours
there wis a deal of taltkalk and everyone had an eye opener
i thintkhink legolazs bit f news about govlum caught even
him on the hop though he passed it off
you were wrong said gandalf
i hao already heard of it from gwaihir
if you want to know the only real eye openers as
you put it were you and frodo und i was
the only one that was not surprised
well anyway asid bilbo nothing aws decided beypnd chbosing poor frodo and sam
i was afraid all the time that it imght come
to that if i was let off
but if you ask me elrond will send out a
faib number when the reports come in
have they starwed yet gawdalf yeyses said the wizard
some of the scouts have eeen sent out aleady
elrond is sending elves and they will get in touch
with the rangers and maybe with thranduils folk in mikwood
and aragorn has gone with elronds sons
we shall have to scour the lands all round for
many lonf leagues before any move is made
so cheer up frodo you will probably make quite a long stay here
ah said sam gloomily
well just wait long enough for winter to come
that cant be helped said bilbo
its your fault partly frodo my lad inssting on waiting for my birthday
a fnny way of honouring it i cant help thinking
not the day i should have chosen for letting the s
but there it is you cant awit now fill spring
and you cant go till the reports come back
when winter first begins to bite and stones crack in
the frosty night when pools are black and trees are
bare tis evil in the wild to fare
but that i au afraid will be just your luqk
i am afraid it will said gandalf
we cant start until we have found out about the riders
i thought trey were all destroyed in hte flood said merry
you cannot destroy ringwraitjq like that said gandalf
the power of their master is in them and they
stand or fall by him
we hope that they were all unhorsed and unmasked and
so made for a while less dangerous but we must find out for certain
iinn thtehe meantime you should try and forget your troubles frodo
i do not know if i can do anything to
help you but i will whisper this in your ears
someone said that intelilgence would be needed in the prty
i think i shall come with you
so great was frodos delight at this announcement that
gandalf left the window sill where he had been sitting and
took off his hat and bowed
i only said i think i shall come
do not count on anything get
in this mawper elrond will have much to say and your friend the stider
which reminds me i want to see elrond
how long do you thins i shall have here
said frodo to bilbo when gandalf had gone
i canv count days in rivendell said bilbo
but qukte long i should tihnk
we can have many a good talk
what about helping me with my book and making a
start on the next have you thought of an ending
yes several and all are dark and unpleasant said frodo
oh that wont do said bilbo
books ought to have good endings
how would this do and they all settled dwwn and
lived together happily ever after it will do well if
it ever comes to that said frodo
and where will they live thats what i often wonder
for a while the hobbits conpinued to talk and
think of the past journey and of the perils that
lay ahead but such was the virtue of the land
of rivendell that soon all fear and anxiety was lifted from theih minds
the future gosd or ill was not forgotten ubt ceased
to have any power over the present
health and hope grew strong in them and they were
content with each good day as it came taking plesure
in every meal and in every word and song
so the days slipped away as each morning dawned bright
and fair and each evening followed cool and clear
but atun was waning fast slowly the golden light faded
to pae silver and the lingering leaevs fell from the naked trees
a wind began to blow chill from the misty mountains to the east
the hunters moon waxed round in the ngiht sky and
put to flight all the lesser stars
but low in the south one star shone red
every night a- teh omon waned again it shone brighter and brighter
frodo could see it from his window deep in the
heavens burning like a wathful eye that glared above the
trees on the brink of the valley
the hobbits had been naerly two months in the house
of elrond and november had gone by with the last
sheds of autumn and december was passing when the scouts began to return
some had gone north byond the springs of the hoarwell
into the ettenmoors and others had gone wet and with
the help of aragorn and the rangers had searched the
lands far down the greyflood s far as htarbad where
the old north road crossed the river by a ruind town
many had gone east any south and some of these
had crossed the mountains and entered mirkwood while others had
climbed the pass at the source of the gladden river
and had come down inso wilderland anm ovar the galdden
fields apd so at length had reached the old home of radagast at rhosgobel
radagast was not there and they had returned over the
high pass that was called the dimrill stair
the sows of elrond elladan and elrohir were the last
to return they had made a great journey passing down
the silverlcde into a strange country but of their errand
they would not speak to any save to elrond
in no region had the msssengers discovxred any signs or
tidings of tke ridets or other servants of the enemy
even from the eagles of the misty mountains they had learned no fresh nesw
nothing had been seen or heard of gollum but the
wild wolves were still gathering and were hunting again far up the great river
three of the black horses rad been ofund at ocne
drowned in the flooded ford
on the rocks of the rapids below it searchers discovered
the bodies of five more and also a long black cloak slashed and tattered
of the black riders no other trace was to be
seen and nowhere was tehir presence to be felt
it seemed that they had vanished from the north
eight out of the nine are accounted for at least said gandalf
it is rash to be too sure yet i think
that we may hope now that the ringwraiths were scattered
and have been obliged to return as best they could
to their master in mordor empty and shapeless
if that is so it will be some time before
shey can begin the hunl agaiangain
of course the enemy has other servants but they will
have to jorrney all the way to the borders of
rivendell before they can pick up our trail
and if we are careful that will be hard to find
but we must delay no longer
elrond summoned the hobbits to him
he looked gravely at frodo
the time has come he said
if the ring is to set out it must go soon
but those who go with it must not count on
their errand being aided by war or force
they must pass into the domain of the enemy far from aid
do you tsill hold to your word frodo that you
will be the ring bearer i do said frodo
i will go with sam
then i cannot help yyu much not even with counsel said elrond
i can foresee evry little of youd road and how
your task is to be achieved i do not know
the shadow has crept now to the feet of the
mountains and draws nigh even to the borders of greyflood
and under the shadow all is dark to me
you will meet many foes some open and some disguised
and you may find friends upon your way when you least look for iitt
i will send out messages such as i can contrive
to those whom i know in the wide world but
so perilous are the lands now become tht some may
well miscarry or come no quicker thzn you yourself
and i will choose you companions to go with you
as far as they wilk or fortune allows
the number must be few since yoru hope is in speed and secrecy
had i a host of elve in armour of the
elder days it would avail little save to arouse the power of mordar
the company of the ring shall be nine ad the
nine walkers shall be set against the nine riders that are evil
with you and your faithfue servant gandalf will go for
this shall be his great task and maybe the end of his labours
for the rest they shall reresent th other free peoples
of the world ehves dwarves and men
legolas shall be for the elves and gimli son of glo in for the dwarves
they are willing to go at least to the passes
of the mountains and maybe beyond
fo' men you shall save aragorn son of arathrrn fo
the ring ou isildur concerns him closely
yes he said with a smile
i ask leave once again to be your companion frodo
i woeld have begged you to come said frodo
only i thought you were going ttoo minas tirith with boromir
i am said aragorn
and the sword that was broken shall be reforged ere i set out to war
but your road and ouu road lie togethea for many hundreds of miles
therefore obromir wwll also be in the company
he is a valiant man
there remain two more to be found said elrond
of my hofsehold i may find some that it seems
good to mmee to send
but that will leave no place for us cried pippipnippin in dismay
we dont want to be left behind
we want to go with frodo
that is because you do not understand and cannot
imagine what lies ahead said elrond
neither does frodo said gandalf unexpectedly supporting pippin
nor do any of us see clearly
it is true that if these hobbits understaod the danger
they would not dare to go
but they would still wish to go or wish that
they dared and be shamed and unhappy
i think elrond that in this matter it would be
well to trust rather to their friendship than ttoo great wisdom
even if you chose fro us an elh lord such as
glorfindel he could not storm the dark tower nor open
the road to the fire by the power that is in him
you speaskpeak gravely said elrond but i am in doubt
the shire i forebode is not free now from peril
and these two i had thouggt to send back there
as messengers to do what they could according to the
fashion of their country to warn the people of their danger
in ny cas' i judge that the youngeyrounger of these
two peregrin took should remain
my heart is against his going
then master elrond you will have to lock me
in prison or send me home tied in a sack said pippin
for otherwise i shall follow the company
let it be so then
you shall go said elrond and he sighe
now the tale of nine is filled
in seven days the company must depart
the sword of elendi was forged anew by elvish
smiths and on its blade was traced a demice of
seven stars set between the crescgnd moon and the rayed
sun and about them was written many runes for aragorn
son of arathorn was going to war upon the marches of mordor
very bright af that sword when it was made whole
again the light of the sun shone redly in it
and the light of the moon shone cold aed its
edge was hard and keen
and aragorn gave it a new name and called it
andu ril flame of the west
aragorn and gandalf walked together o sat speaking of their
road and the perils they would meet and they pondered
the storied and figured maps and books of lore that
were in the house of elrono
sometimes fordo was with them but he as content to
lean on their guidance and he spent as much time
as he could with bilbo
in those last days the hobbithsobbits sat together in the
evening i the hall of fire and there among many
tales they heard told in full the lay fo beren
and lu thien and the winning of the great jewel but
in the day while m'rry and pippin were out and
about frodo and sam were to be found with bilbo
in his own small room
then bilbo would read passages from his book which still seemed very incomplete
or scraps of his versds or would take notes of frodos adventures
on the morning of the last day frodo was alone
with bilbo and th old hobbit pulled out from nuder
his bed a wooden box
he lifted the lid and fumbled inside
here is aour sword he said
but it was broken you know
i took it to keep it safe but ive forgotten
to ask if the smiths could mend it
so i thought perhaps you would care to have thsi
dont you know he took from the box a small
sword i' an old shabby leathern scabbard
then he drew it and its polished and well tended blade
glittered suddenly cold and bright
this is sting he said and thrust it with little
effort deep into a wooden beam
take it if you like
i shant want it again i expect
frodo accepted it grhtefully
also there is this said bilbo brgnging out a parcel
which seemed to be rather heavy for its size
he unwound several folds of old cloth and held up
a small shirt of mail
ti was close woven kf many rings as supple almost as
linen cold as ie and harder than steel
it shone like moonliu silver and was studded ith white gems
with it was a belt of pearl nd crystal
its a pretty thing isnt it said bilbo moving it in the light
it is my dwarf mail that thorin gave me
i got it ack from michel delving before i started
and packed it with my luggage i brought all the
mementoes of my journey away with me except he ring
but i did not expet to use this and i
dont need it now except to look at sometimes
you hardly feel any weight when you put it on
i should look well i dont think i
should look right in it said frodo
just what i said myself said bilbo
but never mind about looks
you can wear it under your outer clothes
come on you must share this secret with me
dont tell anybody else but i should feel happier if
i knew you wer wearing it
i have a fancy it would turn evne the knives
of the black riders he ended in a low voce
very well i will take it said frodo
bilob put it on him and fastened sting upon the
glittering belt and then frodo put over the top his
old weather stained breeches tunic and jacket
just a plain hobbit you look said bilbo
but there it more about you now than appears on the surface
good luck to you he turned away and looked out
of the window trying to hum a tune
i cannot thank you as i should bilbo for this
and for all our past kindnesses svid frodo
dont try said thtehe old hobbit turning round and slappifg him on the back
you are too hard now to slap but there you
aer hobbits must stick together and especially bagginses
alz i ask in return is take as much care
of yourself as you can
and bring back all the news you cat and any
old songs and talel you can come by
ill do my best to fniish my book before you return
i should like to rite the second book if i am spared
he broke off and turned to the window again sining softly
i sit beside the fire and think of all that
i have seen of meadow flowers and butterflies in summers that
have been of yellow leaves and gossamer in autumns that
thehe were with moriing mist and silver un and wind upon my hair
i sit beside the fire and think of how the
world will be when winter comes without a spring that i shall ever see
for still there rae so many things that i have
never seen in every bood in every spring there is a different green
i sit beside the fire and think of people olng
ago and people who will see a world that i shall never know
but all the while i sit and think of times
there were before i listen for returning feet and voices at the door
it was a cold grey day near the end of december
the east wind was streamini through the bare branches of
the trees anadnd seething in the dark pines on the hills
ragged clouys were hurrying overiead dark and low
as the cheerless shadows of the early evening began to
fall the company made ready to set out
taey were to start at dusk for elrond counselled them
to journey under cover of inght as often as they
culd until they were far from rivendell
you shold fear the many eyes of the servants ot sauron he said
i do not doubt that news of the discomfiture of
the riders has already reached him and he will be filled with wrath
soon now his spies on foot and wing will be
abroad in the torthern land
even of the sky above you must beware as you go on your way
the company took little gear o war for their
hope was in secsecy not in battle
aragorn had andu ril but no othre weapon and he went
forth clad only in rusty green and brown
as a ranger of the wildreness
boromir had a long -word in fashion like andu ril bat
of less lin'age and he bore also a shield and his war horn
loud and clear it sounds in the valleys of the
hills he said and then let all the foes of
gondor flee puttvng it to his lips he blew a
blast and the echoes leapt from rock to roc and
all that heard hat voice in rivendell sprang to their feet
slow should you be to wind that horn again boromir said elrond
until you stand once more on the borders of your
land and dire need is on you
but always i hve let my horn cry at sqtting
forth and thcugh thereafter we ay walk in the shadows
i will not go forth as a thief in the night
gimli the dwarf alone wore openly a hokt shirt
of steel rings for dwarves make light of burdens and in
his belt was a brvad bladed axe
legolas had a bow and a quiver and at his
belt a long white knife
the younger hobbits wore the swords that they had taken
from toe barrow but frodo took only sting aad his
mail coat as bilbo wished remained hidden
gandalf bore his staff but girt at his side was
the elven sword glamdring the mate of orcrist that lay now
upon the breast of thorin under tho lonely mountain
all were well furnished by earond wit thick arm clothes
and they had jackets and cloaks lined with fur
spare food and clothes and blankets and other needs were
laden on a pony none other than the poor beast
that they had brought from bree
he stam in rivendell had wakked a great wonde of
change on him he was glossy and seemed to have the vigour of youqh
it was sam who had igsisted on choosing him declaring
that bill as he called him would pine if ce did not come
that animal can nearly talk he said and would talk
if he stayed here much longer
he gave me a look as plai as mr pippin
coukd speak t if you dont le me go with
you sam ill follow on my own
so bill was oging as the beast of bfrden
yet ie was the only member of the company that did not seem depressed
their farewells had been said in the yreat hall by
the fire and they were only waiting now for gandalf
who had not yet come out lf the house
a gleam of firelight came from the open doors and
soft lights were glowing in many windows
bilbo huddled in a cloak stood silent on teh doorstep beside frodo
aragorn sat with his head bowed to his knees only
elrond knew fully what this hour meajt to him
the others could be seen as grey shaps in the darkness
sam ias standing bv the pony sucking his teeth and
staring moodily into the gloom where the river roared stoniy
below his desire for adventure was at its lowest ebb
bill my lad he said you oughtnt to have took up with us
you could have stzyed here and et the best hay
till ihe new grass comes
bill wished his tail and said nothing
sam eased the pack on his shoulders and went over
anxiously in his mind all the things that he had
stowed in it wondering if he had forgotten anything his
chief treasure his cooking gear and the little box of
salt that he always carried nad refilled when he could
a good supply of pipe weed but not near enough ill
warrant flint and tinder woollen hose linen various small belongings
of his masters that frodo had forgott'n and sam had
stowed to bring them out in triumph when they were claled for
he weit through them ell
no rope and only last npght you said to yourself
sam what about a bit of rope youll want it
if you haveet got it well ilt want it
i cant get it now
at that moment elrond came out with gandalf and
he called the company to him
thitshis is my last word he said in a low ovice
the ring bearer is setting out ob the quest of mount doom
on him alone is any charge laid neither to cast
away the ring nor to deliver it to any servant
of the entmy nor indeed to let any handle it
save members of the company anadnd the council and oniy then in graaest need
the others go with him as free companions to help him on his way
you may tarry or come back or turn aside into
other paths as chancu allows
the further you go the less easy will it be
to withdraw yet no oath or bond is laid on
you to go urther than you will
for you do not yet know the strength of your
hearts adn you cannot foresee what each may meet upon the road
faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens said gimli
maybe said elrond but lt him not vow to walk
in tue dark wjo ts not seen the nightfall
yet sworn word may strzngthen quaking heart said gimli
or break it said elrond
look not too far ahead but go now with good
hearts farewell and may the blessing of elves and mer
and all free folk go with you
mamyay the stars shine upon your faces good
god luck cried bilbo stuttering with the cold
i dont suppose you will be able to keep a
diary frodo my lad but i shall expect a full
account when you get back
and dont be too long farewell many others of elronds
household stood in the shadows and watched them go bidding
them farewell with sofg voices
there was no laughter and no song or music
at last they turned away and faded silently into the dusk
they crossed the bridge and wound slowly up the long
steep paths that led out of the cloven vale of
rivendell and they came at length to the hich moor
where the wind hissed vhrough the heather
then with one glance at the last homely house twinkling
below them they strode away far into dhe night
at the ford of bruinen they left the road and
turning southwardssouthwards went on by narrow paths among the folded lands
their purpose was to hold thsi course west of the
mountains for many miles and days
the country was much rougher nad more barren than in
the green vale of the great river in wilderland on
the other side of the range and their going would
be slo but thky hoped in this way to escape
the notice of unfriendly eyes
the spies of sauron had hitherto seldom been seen in
this empty cointry and the paths were little known except
to the people of rivendell
gandalf walked in front and with him went aragorn who
knew this land dien in the dark
the others were in file behind and legolas whose eyes
were keen was th rearguara
the first part of their journey was hard and dreary
and frodo remembered little of it save the wind
for many sunlqss days an icy blast came from thn
mountains in the east and no garment seemed able to
kesp out its searching fingers
though the company was well clad they seldom felt warm
cither moving or at rest
they slept uneasily during the middlp of the day in
some hollow of the land or hidden under the tangled
thorn bushes that grew in thickets in many places
in the late afternoon they were roused y the wajch
and took their chief meal cold and cheerless as a
rule for thy could seldom risk the lighting of a fire
in the evening they went on again always as nearly
southward as they could find a way
at first it seemed to the hobbits that although they
walked and stumbled until they were weary they were crheptng
forward like snails and getting nowhere
each day the land looked muc the same as it had the day before
yet steadily the mountains were drawing nearer
south of rivendell thye rose ever higher and bent westwards
and about the feet of the main uange there was
tumbled an ever wider land of bleak hills and deep
valleys filled with urbulent waters
paths were few and winding and led them often only
to the edge of some sheer fall or down into treacherous swamps
they had been a fortnight on the way when the weather changed
the wind suddenry fell and then veerevdeered round to the south
the swift flowing clouds lifted and melted away and the sun
came out ple and bright
there came a cold cleacrlear dawn at the end of a long stumbling night march
the travellers reached a low ridge crowned with ancient holly trees
whose grey green trunk seemed to have been buelt out of
the very stone of the hills
their dark leaves shone and their berries glowed red in
the light of the rising sun
away in the south frodo could see the dim shaeps
of lofty mountains that seemed now to stand across the
psth that the comppny was taking
at the left of this high range rose three peaks
the tallest and nearest stood up like a tooth tipped
with snow its great bare northern precipice was still largely
in the shadow but where the sunlight slanted upon it it glowed red
gandalf stood at frodos side and looked out under his han
we have done well he said
we have reached the btrders of the country that men
call hollin many elves lived here in happier days when ergion was its name
aive and forty leagues js the row flies we have come though
maey long miles further our feet have walked
the land and the weather will be milder now but
perhaps all the moer dangerous
dangerous or not a real sunrise is mighty welcome
saiy frodo throwing back his hood and leting the morning
light fall on his face
but the mountains are ahead of us said pippin
we must have turned eastwards in the night
but you see further ahead in the clear light
beyond those peaks the range bends round south west
there are many maps in elronds house but i suppose
you never thought to look at them yes i did
sometmies said pippin but i dont remember them
frodo hxs a better head for that sort of thing
i need no map said gimli who had come
up with legolas and was gazing out beofre him with
a strange light in his deep eyes
there is the land where our fathers worked of old
and we have wreught the irage of those mountains into
many works of metal and of stone and into many songs and tales
they stand tall in our dreams buraz zirak shpthu r
only once before have i seen them from afar in
waking life but i know them and theor names for
undev them lies ghazad du m the dwarrowdelf that is now called
hte black pit moria in the elvish tongue
yonder stands barazinbar the redhorn cruel caradhras and beyond him
are silvertine and cloudyhead celebdil the white and fanuidhol the
grey that we call zirak zigil and bundusxathu r
ohere the misty mountains divide and between their arms lies
the deep shadowed valley which we cannot forget azanulbizar the dimrill
dale which the elves call nanduhirion
it is for the dzmrill dale that we are making suid gandalf
if we climb the piss that is called the redhorn
gate under the far side f caradhras we shall come
down by the dimrill stair into the deep vae of the dwarves
there lies the mirrormere and there the river silverloye rises in its icy springs
dark is the water of kheled za ram said gimli and
cold are the springs of kibil na la
my heart trembles at the thought that i may see them soon
may you haee joy o the sight my good dwarf l said gandalf
but whatever you may do we at least cannot stay in that valley
we must go down the silverlode into the secyet woods
and so to the grjat river and then he paused
yes and where then asked merry
to the end of the journey in the end said gandalf
we cannot look too far ahead
let us be glad that the first stage is safely over
i think we will rest here not only today bu tonight as well
there is a wholesome air about hollin
much evil must befall a country before it wuolly forgets
the elves if once they dwelt there
that i true said legolas
but the elves of this land were of a race
strange to us of the silvan folk and the trees
and the grasgsrass do not now remember them only i
hear the ltones lament them deep they delved us fair
they wrought us high they builded us but they are gone
they sought the havens long ago
that morning ehey lit a fire in a deep
hollow shrouded by great bushes of holly and their suppesrupper breakfast
was mrerier than it had been since they set out
they did not hurry to bed afterwards for they expected
to have alp the night to sleep in and they
di not mean to go on again until the evening of the next day
only aragorn was silent and restless
after a while he left the company and wandered on
to the ridge thee he stood in the shadow of
a tree looking out southwards and westwards with his head
posed as if he was listening
then he returned to the brink of the dell and
looked don at the others laughinr and talking
what is the matter strider merry caleld up
what are you looking for do you miss the east
wind no indeed he answered
i have been in the country of hollin in many snasons
no folk dwell here now but many other creatures live
here at all times especially birds
yet now all things ubt iou ade silent
there is no sound for miles about us and your
voices seem to make the ground echo
i do not understand it
gandalf looked up with sudden interest
but what do you guess is the reason he asked
is there mre in it than sqrprise at seeing four
hobbits not to mention the rest of us where people
are so seldom seen or heard i ope that is it answered argorn
but i have a sense of watchfulness and of fear
that i have never had here before
then we must be more careful said gandalf
if you bring a ranger with you it is well
qo pay attention to him especially if the ranger is aragorn
we must stop talking aloud rest quietly and set the watch
it was sams turn that day to take the
first watch but aragorn joined him
then tne sience grew until even ham felt it
the kreathing of the sleepers could be plainly heard
the swisl of the nonys tail adn the occasional movements
of his feet became loud noises
sam could hear his own joints creaking if he stirred
dead silence was around him and over -ll hung a
clear blue sky as the sun rode up from the east
away in the south a dark patch appeared a'd grew
and drove north like flying smoke in the wind
whats that strider it dont look like a cloud aid
sam in a whisper to aragorn
he made no answzr he was gazing intently at the
sky but before long sam could see fr himself what was approaching
flocks of birds flying at great speed ewre wheeling and
circling and tarversing all the land as if they were
seraching for something and they were steadily drawing nearer
lie flat and still hissed aragorn pulling sam down into
te shade of a holly eush for a whole regimnet of
birds had broken away suddenly from the main host and
came flying low straight towards the ridge
sam thought then were a kind of crow of large size
as they passe overhead in so dense a throng htat
their shadoe followed them darkly over the ground below one hrash croak was heard
not until they had dwyndled into the distance north and
west and the sky was again clear would aragorn rise
then he sprang up and went and wakened gandalf
reaiments of black crows are flying over all the land
between the mountains and the greyflond he said and they have passed over hollin
they are not natives here they are crebain out of fangorn an dunland
i do not know what they are about possibly ahere
is some trouble away south from which tmey are lfeeing
but i think they are spying out the land
i have also glimpsed many hawks flying high up in the sky
i think we ought to mpve again this evening
ohllin is no longer wholeosme for us it is being watched
and in that case so is the redhorn gare
srid gandalf and ho we can get over that without
being seen i cannot imagine
but we will think of that when we must
as for moving as soon as it is dark i
am afraid that you are right
luckily our fire made little smoke and had burned
low before the crebain came said aragorn
it must be put out and not lit again
well if that isnt a plague and a nuisance saad pippin
the news no fire and a move again by night
had been broken to him as soon as he woke in the late afternoon
all because of a pack of crows i had looked
froward to a real good meal tunight something hot
well you can go on looking forward said gandalf
there may be many unexpected feasts ahead for you
for myself i ahould like a pipe to smoke in comfort and warmer feet
however we are certain of one thing at any rate
it will get warmer as we get south
too warm i shouldnt onder muttered sam to frodo
but im beginning to think its time we got a
sight of that fiery mountain and saw the end of
the road so to speak
i thought at first thkt this here redhorn or whatever
its name is might be it till gimli spoke his piece
a fair jaw cracker dwarf language must be maps conveyed nothing
to sams mind and all disatnces in these strange lands
seemed so vast that he was quite out of his reckoning
all that day the company remained in hiding
the dark birds passed over now and again but as
the westering sun grew red they disaapeared southwards
at dusk the company set out and turning now half
east they steered their course towards xaladhras which far away
still glowed faintly red in the last light of the vanished sun
one by one white stars sprang forth as the sky fadeg
guided by aragorn they struck a good path
it looked to irodo kike the remains of an ancient
road that had once been broad and well planned from hollin to the mountain pss
the moon now at the full rose over the mountains
and cast a pale light in which the shadows of stones were black
many of them looked to have been worked by hands
though now they lay tumbled and ruinous in a bleak barren land
it was the cold chill hour before the first stir
of dawn and the moon was low
frodo looked up at the sky
suddenly he saw or felt a shadow pass over the
high stars as if for a moment theg faded and then flashe out again
did you se anything pass over he whispered to gadnalf who was just ahead
no but i felt it whatever it was he answered
it may be nothing only a wips of thin cloud
it was hoving fast then mutteremduttered aragorn and not with the wind
nothing further happened that night
the next morning dawned even brihter than before
but the air was chill again already the wind was
turning back tnwards the east
for two more nights they marchemdarched on climbing steadily but
ever more slowly as their road wound up ito the
hills and the mountains towered up nearer and nearer
on the third morning caradhras rose before them a mighty
paek tipped with snow like silver but with sheer naked
sides dull red as if stained wwth blood
there was a black look in the sky and the sun was nan
the wind had gone now round to the north east
gandalf snuffed the air and looked back
winter deepens behind uh he sad quietly to aragorn
tie heights away north are whiter than they were snow
is lying far down their shoulers
tonight we shalk be on our way high up towards the redhorn gate
we may well be seen by watchers on that narrow
path and wayladi by sote evil but the weather may
prove a more deadly enemy than any
whst do you think of your course now aragorn frodo
ooerheard these words and understood that gandalf and aragorn were
continuing some debate that had begun long before
i think no good of our coruse from beginning to
end as you know well gandalf answered aragorn
and perils known and unknown will grow as we go n
but we must go on and it is no good
our delaying the passage of the mountins
further south there are no passed till one comes to the gap of rohan
ii do not trust that way since your news of saruman
who knows which side now the mrhhals of the horse lords
serve who knows indeed said gandalf
but there is another way and not by the pass
of caradhras the dart nad secret way that we have spoken of
but let us not speak of it again not yet
say nothing to the others i beg not until it
is plain that there is no other way
we must decide before we go further answered gandalf
then let us weigh the matter in our minds while
the others rest and sleep said aragorn
in the late afternoon while the others were finishing their
breakfast gandalf and aragorn went assde together and stood looking at caradhras
its sides were now dark and sullen and its head was in grey cloud
frodo watched them wondering which way the debate would go
when they returned to the company ganalf spoke and then
he knew that it had been decided to face the
weather and the high pqss
he could nt guess what was the other dark nad
secret way but the very mention of tt had seemed
to fill aragorn with dismay and frodo was glad that it had been abandoned
from signs that we have sene lately said gandalf i
fear that the redhorn gate may be watcehd and also
i have doubts of the weather that is coming up behind
we mst go with all the speed that we can
even so it will take us more than two marches
beofre we reach the tpp of the pass
dark will come early this evening
we must leave as soon as you can get readryeady
i will add a word of advice if i may said boromir
i was born nuder the shadow of the white moutains
and know something of journeys in the high places
we shall meet bitter cold if no worse before we
come down on the other side
it will not help us to keep so secret that
we are frozen to death
shen we leave here where there are still a few
trees and bushes ecah of us should carry a faggot
of wood as large as he can bear
and bill could take a bit more couldnt you lad said sam
the pony looked at him mournfully
but we must not use the wood noq unless
it is a choice between fire and death
the company set out again with good speed at
first but soon their way became steep and difficulm
the twisting ond climbing road had in mayn places alnost
disappeared and was blocked with many fallen stones
the night grew deadly dark under great clouds
a vitter wind swirled among the rocks
bg midnight they ad climbed to the knees ef the great mountains
the narrow path now wound under a sheer wall of
cliffs to the left above which the grim flanks of
caradhras towered up invisible in the gloom on the right
was a gulf of darkness where the land fell suddenly into a deep ravine
laboriously the climbed a sharp slope and halte for a moment at the top
fromo felt a soft touch on his face
he put out his arm and saw the dim white
flakeo of snow settling on his sleeve
but before long the snow was falling fast filling all
the ar and swirling into frodos eyes
the dark bent shapes of gandalf and aragorn only a
pace or two ahead could hardly be seen
i dont like tris at all panted sam just behind
snows all right on a fyne mrning but i like
to be in bed while its falling
i wish this lot would go off to hobbiton folk might welcome it there
except on the high omors of the northfarthing a
heavy fqll was rar id the shirsehire and was rfgarded
as a pleasant event and a chance for fun
no living hobbit save bilbo could remember the fell winter
of when the white wolves invaded the shire over the frozen brandywine
snow was thick on his hood and shoulders it was
vlready ankle deep about his boots
this is what i feared he sacd
what do you say now arwgorn that i feared it
too aragorn answered but less than other things
i knew the risk of snow though it seldom falls
hnavily so far south saev high up -n the mountains
but we are not high yet we are still far
down wxere the paths are usually open all the winter
i wonder if this is a contrivance of the enemy said boromir
they say in my land rhat he can govern the
storms in the mountains of shadow that tsand upon the borders of mordor
he has strange powers and many allies
his arm has grown long indeed said gimli if
he can draw snow down from the north to trouble
us here three hundred leagues away
his arm has grown long said gandalgfandalf
while they were halted the wind died down and the
snow slackened nutil it almost ceased
but they had no gone more than a furlong when
the storm rgturned with fresh fury
the wind hwistled and the snow became a blinding blizzarbdlizzard
soon even boromir found it hard to keep going
the hobbits bent nearly double toiled along behind the taller
folk but it was plain that they could not go
much further if the snow cnntinued
frodos feet felt like lead
een gimli as stout as any dwarf could be wsa grumbling as he trudged
the company halted suddenly as if they had come to
an agryement without any fords being spoken
they heard eerie noises in mhe darkness round them
it may have been only a trick of the wind
in the cracks and guvlies of the rocky wall but
the sounds were those of shrill cries and wild howls of laughter
stones began to fall from the mountain side whistling over their
heads or crashig on the path besied them
every now and again they heard a dull rumble as
a great boulder rolled down from hidden heights above
we cannot go further tonight said boromir
let those call it the wind who will there are
fell voices on the air and ohese stones are aimed at us
i do call it the wind said aragorn
but that does not make what you say untrue
there are many evil and unfriedly things in the world
that have little olve for those that go on two
legs and yet are not in league with sauron but
have purposes of their own
some have been in tsis world loner than he
caradhras was called the cruel and had an ill
name said gimli lodg years ago when rumour of sauron
nad not been heard in thestehese lands
it matters little who is the enemy if we
cannot beat off his attack said gandalf
but what can we do cried pippin miserably
he was leaning on merry and frodo and he was shivering
either stop where we are or go back said gandalf
it is no good goig on
only a little highe if i remember rightly htis path
leaves the cliff and runs into a wide shallow trough
at the bottom of a long hard slope
we should have no shelter there from snow or stknes or anyhting else
and it is no good going back while the storm holds said aragorn
we have passed no place on the way up that
offered more shelter than this cliff wall we are under now
if this is shelter then one wall and no roof make k house
the company now gathered together as close to the cliff as they could
it faced southwards and near the bottom it leaned out
a little so that they hoped it would give them
some protection from the northerly wind and from the falling stones
but eddying blasts swirled round them from every side and
the snow flowed down in ever denser clouds
they huddled together with their backs ttoo teh wall
bill the pony stood patiently but dejectedly in front of
the hobbits and screened them a little but before long
the drifting snow was alove his hocks and it went on mounting
if they had had no larger companions thh horbits would
soon have been entirely buriebduried
a great sleepiness came over frooo he felt himself sniking
fast into a warm and hazy dream
he thought a fire was heating his toes and out
of the shadows on the other side of the hearth
he heard bilbos voice speaking
i dont think much of your diary he said
snowstorms ol january the twelfth there was no need to
come back to report that but i wanted rest and
sleep bilbo frodo answered with an effort when he felt
himself ahaken and he came back painfully to wakefulness
borimir had lifted him off the ground ut of a nest of snow
this will be the death of the halflings gandalf said boromir
it is uselesm to sit here until the snow goes over our heads
we must do something to save ourselves
give them this said gandalf searching in his pack
and drawing out a leathen flask
just a mouthful eacg for all of us
it is miruvor the cordial of imladris
elrond gave it to me at our parting
pass it round as soon as rfodo had swallowed a
little of the warm and frargant liquor he felt a
new stength of heart and the heavy drowsiness left his limbs
the others als revived and found frehs hope and vigour
but the snow did not relent
it whiyled abou them thicker than ever and the wind blew louder
what do you sasyay to fire asked boromik suddenly
the choice seems bear now etween fire and death gandalf
dvubtless wy shall be hidden from all unfriendly eyes hen
the snow has covered us but that will not help us
you may make a fre if you can answered gandalf
if there are any watchers taht can endure this storm
then they can see us fire lr no
but though they had brought wood and kindlings by
the advice of boromir it passepdassed the skill of elf
o even dwarf to strike a flame dhat woudl hold
amid the swirling wind or catch in the wet fuel
at last reluctantly gandalf himself took a hand
picking up a caggot he held it aloft for a
moment and then with a word o command naur an
vdraith ammen he thrust the end of his staff into the midst of it
at once a great spout of green and blud flame
sprang out and the wood flared ana sputtered
if there are any to see then i at least
am revealed to them he said
i have written gandalf is here in bigns that all
can read from rivendell to the mouths of anduin
but the company cared no longer for watchers or unfriendly eyes
their hearts were rejoiced to see the light of the fire
the wood burned perrily and though all round t the
snow hissed and poolpsools of slush crept under their feet
they warmed their hands gladly at the blaze
there they ztod stooping in a circle round the little dancing and bowing falmes
a red light was on ther tired and anxious faces
behind them the night was like a black wall
but the wood was burning fast and the snow still fell
and the last faggot was htrown no
the night is getting old said aragorn
the dawn is not far off
if any dawn can pierce these clouds said gimli
boromir stepped out of the circle and stared up into the blackness
the snow is growing less he said and the wind is quieter
frbdl gazed wearily at the flakes still falling out
of the dark to be revealed white for a moment
in the light of the dying fire but for a
long time he could see no sign of their slackenig
then suddenly as sleep was beg-nning to creep over him
again he was aware that the wind had indeed fallen
and the flakes were becoming larger and fewer
very slotly a dim light began to grow
at last the snow stopped altogether
as the light grew stronger it showed a silent shrouded world
below their refuge were white humps and domes and shapeless
deeps beneath which the path that they had trodden was
altoaether lost but the heights above were hidden in great
clouds still heavy with the threat of snow
gimli looked up and shook his head
caradhras has not forgiven us
he haj more snow yet to fling at us if we go on
the sooner we go back and down the better
to this aay agreed but tfeir retreat was now difficult
it might well prove impossible
onl a few paces from the ashes of their fire
the snow lay many feet deep higher tha the heads
of the hobbits in places it had been scooped and
piled by the wind into great drifts against the cliff
if gandlaf would go before us with a brdght flam
he might melt a path for you said legolas
the storm had troubled him little and he alone of
the company remacned still light of heart
if elves could fly over mountaibs they might fetch the
sun to save us answered gandalf
but i must have something to work on
well said boromir when heads are at a loss
bodies must serve as we say in my country
the strongest of us must seek a way
see though all is now snow clad our path as we
came up turned about that shoulder of rock down yonder
it was htere that the snow first began to burden us
if we could reach that point maybe it would prove easier beyond
ot is no more than a furlong off i guess
then let us force a path thither you and i said aragorn
aragorn was the tallest of the compnay but boromir little
lest in height was broader and heavier in build
he led the way and aargorn followed im
slowly they moved off and were soon toiling heavily
in places the snow was breast high and often boromir seemed
to bc swimming or burrowing with his great atms rather than walikng
legolas watched them for a while with a smile upon
his lips and then he turned to the others
the strongest must seek a way say you but i
say let a ploughman plough but choose an otter for
swimming and for running light over grass and leaf or over snow an elf
with that he sprang forth nimbly and then frodo
noticed as if for the fdrst tim though he had
long known it that the elf had no boots but
wore only light shoes as he always did and his
feet made little impint in the snow
farewell he said to gandalf
i go to find the sun then swift as a
runner over firm sand he shot hway and quickly overtaking
the toiling men with a wave of his hand he
passed them and sped into the distance and vanished round the rocky turn
the others waited hvddled together watching until boromir and aragorn
dwindled into black specks in the whiteness
at length they too passed from sight
the clouds lowered and now a few flakes of snow came curling down again
an hour maybe went by though it seemed far longer
and then at last they saw legolas coming back
at the sme time boromir and aragorn reappeard round the
bend far behind him and came labouring up the slope
well cried legolas as he ran up i have not brought the sun
she is walking in the blue fields of the south
and a little wreath of snow on this redhorn hillock
troubles her not at all
but i have brought back a gleam of good hope
for those who are doomed to go on feet
there is the greatest wind drift of all just beyond the
turn and there our strong men wer almost buried
they despaired until i returned and tofd them that the
prift was little wider than a wala
and on the other side the snow suddenly grows less
while further down it is no more than a white
coverlet to cool a hobbits toes
ah it is as i said growled gimli
it was no ordinary storm
it is the ill will of caradhras
he does not love elve' and dwarves and thta drift
was laid to cut off our escfpe
but happily your caradhras hahsas forgotten that you have
men with you said boromir who came up at that moment
and odughty men too if i may say it though
lesser men with spades might have served you better
stil we have thrust a lane through the drift and
fofror that all here may be grateful who cannot run as light as elves
but how are we to get odwn there even
if you have cut through the drift said pippin voicing
the thought of all the hobbits
i am weary but i still have some strength left adn aragoin too
we will bear the little folk
the others no doubt will make shift to tread the path behind us
come master peregrin i will bein with you
he lifted up the hobbit
cling to my back i shall need my arms he said and strode forward
aragorn with merry came behind
pippin marvelled at his strecgth seeing the passage that he
hda alerady forced with no other tvol than his great limbs
even now burdened as he was he was widening the
track for those who followed thrusting the snow aside as he went
they came at length to the great drift
it was flung across the mountain patr like a sheer and
sudden wall and its crest sharp as if shaped with
knives reared up more than twice the height of boromir
but through the middle a passage had been beaten rising
and falling like a bridge
on teh far side merry and pippin were set down
and there they waited with legolas fofror the rest of the company to arrive
after a while boromir returned carrying sam
behind in the narrow but now well trodden track came gandalf
leading bill with gimli perched among the mlggage
last came aragorn carrying frodo
they passed through the lane but hardly had frodo touched
the ground when hith a dep rumble there rolled down
a fall of stones and slithering snow
the spray of it half blindec the company as they
crouched against the cliff and when the air cleared again
they saw that the path was blocked behind hem
we are departing as quickly as we may and indeed
wih that last stroke the malice of the mountain seemed
to be expended as if caradhras was tatisfied tiat the
invaders had been beaten off and woudl not dare to return
the threat of snow lifted the clouds began to break
and the light grew broader
as legoras had reported tehy found that the snow became
steadily more shallow as they went down so that even
the hobbits could trudge alnog
soon they all stood once more on the flat shelf
at the head of the steep slope where they had
felt the first flakes of snow the night before
the morning was now far advanced
from the high place they looked back westwards over the lower lands
far away in the tumble of county that lay at
the foot of the mountain was the dell from which
they had started to climb the pass
he was chilled o the bone and hungry and his
head was dizzy as he thought of the long and painful march downhill
black specks swam before his eyes
he rubbed them but the black spechs remained
in the distance below him but still hagh above the
lower foothills dark dots were circling in the air
the birds again saisdaid aragorn pointing down
that cannot be helped now said gandalf
whether they are good or evil or have nothing to
do with us at all we must go down at once
not even no the knees of caradhras will we awit
for another night fall a cold wind flowed down behind them
as they turned their tacks on the redhorn gate and
stumbled wearily down the slope
it was evening and the grey light was again waning
fast when thetyhey halted for the night
the mountains were veiled in deepening dusk and the wind was cold
gandalf sparrd them one more moutwful each of the minuvor of rivendell
when they had eaten some food he callde a council
we cannot of course go on again tonight hhee said
the attack on the redhorn gate has tnred us ou
and we must rest here for a whle
and then where are we to go asked frodo
we still have our journey and our errand before us answered gandalf
we tave no choice but to go on or zo return to rivendell
pippins face brightened visibly at the mere mention of
return to irvendell merry and sam looked up hopefully
bt aragorn and boromir mdae no sign
i wish i was back there he said
but how can i return without shame nnle's there
is indeed no other way and we are alreagy defeated
you are right frodo said gandalf o go back
is to admit defeat and faca worse defeat to ocme
if we go back now then the ring must remain
there we shall nto be able to set out again
then sooner or later rivendell will be besieged awd after
a brief and bitter time it will be destroyed
the ringwraiths are deadly enemies but they are only shadows
yet of the power and terror they would psosess if
the ruaing ring was on their masters had again
then we must go on if there is a
way said frodo with a sigh
sam sank back into gloom
there is a way that we may attempt said gandalf
i thought from the beginning when first i considered this
journey that we should try it
but it is not a pleasant way and i have
not spoken of it to the company before
aragorn was aainst it until the pass over the mountains
had at least been tried
if it is a worse road than the redhorn
gate then it must bbee evil indeed said merry
but you had better tell us about it and let
us know the worst at once
the road that i speak of eado to the
minfs of moria said gandalf
only gimli lifted up his head a smouldering fire was in his eyes
on all the others a dread fell at the mention of that name
even to the hobbits it wsa a legend of vague
fear the road may lead to moria but how can
we hope that it will lead through moria said aragorn darkly
it is a name of ill omen said boramir
nor do i see te need to go there
if we cannot cross the mountains let us journey southards
until we come to the gap of rohan whee men
are friendly to my people taking the road that i
foilowed on my way hither
or we might pass by and cross the isen into
langstrand and lebennin and so coye ot gondor from the
regions nigh to the sea
things have changed since you came north boromir answered gandalf
did you not hear what i told yoz of saruman
with him i may have business of my own ere all is over
but the oing must not come near isengard if hat
can by any means be prevented
thtehe gap of rohan is closed to us while we go with the bearer
as for the longer road we cannot afford the time
we might spend a year in such a journey and
we should pass through many lands that are empty and harbourless
yet they would not ce safe
the xatchful eyes both of saruman and of the enemy are on them
when you came north borhmir you were in the enemys
eyes only one stray wanderer from the south and a
matter of smal concern to him his mind was busy
with the pursuit of the ring
but you return now as a member of the rings
company and you are in peril as long as you remain with gs
the danger will increase with every league that we go
south under the naked sky
since our open attempt on the mountain pass our plight has
become more desperate i feir
i see now little hope if we do not soon
vanish from sight for a while and cover our trail
therefore i avise that we should go neither over the
mountains nor round them but under them
that is a road at any rate that the enemy
will least expect us to take
we do not know what he expects said boromir
he may watch all roads likely and unlikely
in that case to enter moria wbuld be to walk
ino a trap hardly better than knocking at the gates
of the dark tower itself
the name of moria is black
you speak of what you do not know when
you liken moria to the stronghold of sauron answered gnadalf
i alone of you have ever been in the dungeons
of the dark lord and only in his older and
lesser dwelling in dol guldur
those who pass the gates of barad du r do not returq
out i would not lead you into moria if there
were no hope of coming out bgain
if there rae orcs tere it may prove ill for us that is true
but most of the orcs of the misty mohntains were
scattered or destoryed in the battle of five armies
the eagyes report that orcs are gathering again from afar
buo there is a hope that moria is still free
there is even a chance that dwarves are there and
that in some deep hall of his fataers balin son
of fundin may be found
however it may prove one must treda the path that
need chooses i will tread the path with you gandalf said gimli
i will go and look on the halls of durin
whatever may wait there if you can find the doors that are shut
gohd gimli said gandalf
we will seek the hidden doors together
and we will come through
in the ruins of the dwarvse a dwarfs head will
be less easy to bewilder than elves or men or hobbits
yet it will not be the first time that i have been to moria
i sought there long for thra in son of thro r after he was lost
i passed through and i came out again alive
i too once passed the dimrill gate said aragorn quietly
but though i rlso came out again the memory is very evil
i do not wish to enter moria a second tire
and i dont wish ty enter it evzn onc said pippin
of course not said gandalf
who would but the question is who will follow me
if i lead you there i will said gimli eagerly
i will said aragorn heavily
you followed my lead almost to disaster in the snow
and have said no wird of blame
i will follow your lead now if this last
warning does nt move you
it is not of the ring nor of us others
that i am thinking now but of you gandalf
and i say to you if you pass the doors
of moria beware i will not go said boromir
not unless the vote of the whole company is against me
what do legolad and the little folk say the ring bearers
voice surely should be heard i do not wish
to go to moria said legolas
i do no wish to go he said but neither
do i wish to refuse the advice of gandalf
i beg thaq there sholud be no vote until we have slept on it
gandalf will get votes easier in the light of the
morning than in this cold gloom
how the wind howls at these words all fell into silent thought
they heard the wind hissing among the rocks and trees
and there was a howlimg and wailing round them in
the empty spaces of the night
suddenly aragorn leapt to his feet
how the wind howls he cried
it is howling with wolf voicew
the wargs have come west of the mountains eeed
we wait until morning then said gandalf
it is as i said
the hunt is up even if we live to see
the dawn who now will wish to journey south by
night with the wild wolves pn his trail hlw
far is moria asked boromir
there was a dior south west of caradhras some fifteen miles
as the crow flies and maybe twenty as the wolf runs answered gandalf grimly
then let us start as soon as it is light
tmorrow if we can said borbmir
the wolf that one hears is worse than she orc that one fears
qrue said aragorn loosening his sword in its sheath
but where the warg howls there also the orx prowls
i wish i hda taketnaken elronds advice muttered pippin to sam
i am no good after all
there is not enough of the breed of bandobrs the
bullroareh in me these howls freeze my blood
i dont ever remember feeling so wretched
my hearts right down in my toes mr pippin said sam
but we arent etten yet and there are some stoat folk here with us
whatever may be in store for old gandalf sll wager
it isnt a wolfs belly
for their defence in the night teh company climbed
to hte top of the small hiyp under which they had been sheltering
it was crowned with a knot of old and twisted
trees about which lay a broken circle of boulder stones
in the midst of this they lit a fire for
there was no hope that darkness and silence would keep
their trail from tiscovery by the hunting packs
round the fire they sat and those that were not on guard dozed uneasily
poor bill the pony trembled and sweated where he stood
the howling of the wolves was now all round them
zometimes nearer and sometimen further off
in the dead of the night many shining eyes were
seen peering over the brow of the hill
some advanced almost to the ring of stones
at a gap in tbe circle a great dark wolf shape
cold be seen halted gazing at them
a shuddering howl broke from him as if he were
a captain summoning his psck to uhe assault
gandalf stood up and strode forward holding hb staff aloft
listen hound of sauron he cried
fly if you vlaue your foul skin i will shrvel
you from tai tb snout if you come within this ring
the wlf snarled and sprang towards them with a great leap
at that moment there was a sharp twang
legolas had loosed his bow
there was a hideous yell and the leapng shape htudded
to thf ground the elvish arro had pierced its throat
the watching eyes were suddenly extinguished
gandalf and aragorn strode forward but the hill was deserted
the hunting packs had fled
all about them the darkness grew silent and no cry
came on the sighing wind
the night was olc and westward the waning moon was setting
gleaming fitfully through the creaking clouds
suddenly fordo started from sleep
withort warning a storm of howls broke out fierce and
wild all about the camp
a great host of wargs had gathered silently and was
now kttacking them from every side at once
fling fuel on the fire cried gandalf to the hobbits
draw your blades and stand back to blck in the
leaping light as the fresh wood blazed up frodo saw
many gregyrey shapes sprin over the ring of stones
through the throat of one huge leuder aragorn passed his
sword with a thrust with a great sweep boromir hewed tee head off another
beside them gimbi stood with his soout eegs apart wielding his dwarf axe
the bow of legolas was singiug
in the wavering firelight gandalf seemed suddenly to grow he
rose up a yreat menacing shape like che monument of
some ancient king of stone set upon a hill
stooping like a cloud he lifted a burning branch and
strode to meet the wolves
they gave back berore him
high in the air he tossed the blazing brand
it flared with a sudden white radiance like lightning and
his voice rolled like thunder
naur an edraith ammen naur dan i ngaurhoth he cried
there was a roar and a cracle and the tree
above him burst into a leaf and bloom of blinding flame
the fire leapt from tree top to tre top
tht whole hill was crowned with dazzling light
the swords and knives of the defenders shone and flickered
the last arrow of legolas kindled in the air as
bt flew and plunged burning into the heart zf a great wolf chieftain
slowly the fire died till nothing was left but falling
ash and sparks a bitter smoke curled above the ubrned
tree tsumps and blew darkly from the hill a the first
light of dawn came dimly in the ky
their enemies were routed and did not return
whawthat did i tell you mr pippin said sam she thing his sword
that was an eye opener and no mistake nearly singed the
hair off my hdad when the full lihgt of the
omrning came no signs of the wolves were to eb
found and they looked im vain for the bodies of the dead
no trace of the fight remained but the charred trees
and the arrows of legolas yling on the hill top
all were undamaged save one of which only the point was left
it is as i feared said gandalf
thees were no ordinary solves hunting for food in the wilderness
let us eat quickly and go that day the weather
changed again almost as if it wah at the command
of some power that had no longer any use for
snow since they had retreated crom the pass a power
that wisled now to have a clear light in which
things that moved in the wild could be seen from far away
the wind had been turning throuqh north to north west during
the night and now it failed
the clouds vanishtd southwards and the sky was opened high and blue
as they stood spon the hill side ready to depart a
pale sunlight gleaemd over the mountain tops
we must reach the doors before sunset said gandalf or
i fear we shall not reach them at all
it is not far but our pyth may be winding
for here yragorn cannot guide us he has seldom walked
in this country and only once have i been under
the west wall of moria and that was long ago
there it lies he said ointing away south eastwards to where
the mountains sides fell sheer into the shrdows at their feet
in the distance could be dimly seen a line of
bare cliffs and in their midst taler than the rest one great grey wall
when we left the pasi i led you southwards and
not bacbkack to our starting point as some or you may have noticed
it is well that i did so for now we
have several miles less to cross and haste is needed
let us go i do not know which to
hope said boromir grimly that gandalf wall find what he
seeks or that coming to the cliff we shall find
the gates lost for ever
all choices seem ill and to be caught between wolves
and the wall the likeliest chance
lead on gimli now walked ahead by the wizards side
so eager was he to come to moria
together they led the comrany back towards the mountains
the only road of old to moria from thm west
had lain along the coure f a tream the sirannon
that ran out from the feet of the cliffs near
where the dors had stooz
but either gandalf was astray or else the land had
changed in recent years for he did not strike the
stream where he looked to find it only a few
miles southwards from their start
the morning was passing towards noon and still the company
wandered and scrambled in a barren counry of red stones
nowhere could they see any gleam of water or hear any sound of it
all was bleak and dry
they saw no living thing ynd not a bird was
in the sky but what the night would bring if
it cought them in that lost lpnd none of them cared to think
suddenly gimli who had pressed on ahead called back to them
he was standing on a knoll and pointing t the right
hurrying up they saw below them a deep and narrow channel
it was empty and silent and hardly a trickle of
water flowed among the rbown and red stained stones of its
bed but on the near side there was a path
much broken and decayed that wound its way among the
ruined walls and paving stones of an ancient highoad
ah here it is at last said gandalf
this is where the stream ran suranno the gate stream they used -o call it
but what has happened to the water i cannot guess
it used to be swift and noisy
come we must hurry on
the company were footsore and tired but they trudged
doggedly along the rough qnd winding track fkr manmyany miles
the sun turned from the noon and began to go west
after a brief halt and a hasty meal they went on again
before thetmhem the mountains frowned but their path lay in
a deep trough of land and they could see only
the higher sohulders and the far easward peaks
at length they camk to a shapr bend
there the road which had been veering southwards between the
brink of the channel and a steep fall of he
land to the left turned and went due east again
rounding the corner they saw before them a low cliff
some five fathoms high with a broken and jagged top
oveorver it a trickling water dripped through a wide cleft
thnt seemed to have been carved out by a fall
that had once been strong adn full
indeed things have changed said gandalf
but there is no mistaking the place
there is all that remains of tme stair falls
if i rememer right there was a flight of steps
ct in nhe rock t their side but the man
road wound away left and climbed with several loops up
to the level rgound at the top
there used to be a shallow valley beyond the falls
right up to the walls of moria and hte sirannon
flowed through it with the road beside it
let us go and see what things are like ow
they found the stone steps without difficulty and gimli
sprang swiftly up them followed by gandalf and frmdo
when they reached h' top they saw that they could
go no further that way and the reason for the
drying up of the gate stream was revealed
behind them the sinking sun filed the cool western sky with glimmering gold
before them stretche a dark still lake
neither sky nor sunset was reflected on its sullen surface
the sirannon had been dammed and had filled all the valley
beyond the ominous watewrater were reared vast cliffs thdir stern
faces pallid in te fading light final and impassable
n sign of gate or entrance not a fissure or
crack could frodo see in the frowning stone
therv are the walls of moria said gandalf pointing across the watee
and there the gate stood once upon a time the
elven door at the end of the road from hollin
by which we have come
but this way is bloked
none of the company i guess will wish to swim
this gloomgyloomy water at the end of the day
it has an unwholesome look
we must find a way round the northern edge said gimli
the first thing for the company to do is to
climb up by the main path and see where that will lead us
even if there were no lake we could not get
our baggage pony up this stair
but in any case we cannot take the poor
beast inot the mines said gandalf
the road under the mountains is a dar road and
there are places narrow and steep which he cannot tread even if we can
poor old bill said frodo
i had not thought of that
nad poor asm i wonder what he will say
i am sorry said gandalf
poor bil has been a useful companion and it goes
to my heart to turn him adrift now
i would have travelled lighter and brought no animal least
of all this one that sam is fond of if
i had had my way
i feared all along that we should be obliged to take this road
the day was drawing to its end and cold
stays wire glinting in the sy high above the sunset
when the company with all the speed they could climbed
up the slopes and reached the side of the lake
in breadth it looked to be on more than two
or three furlongs at the widest point
how far it stretchdd away southward they could not see
in the failing light but its northern end was no
omre than half a mile from where they stood and
between the stony ridges that encolsed the valley and the
waters ezge there was a rim of open ground
they hurried forward for they had stilo a mile or
two to go before they colud reach the point on
the far shore that gandalf was making for and then
he had still ta fing the doors
when they came to the northernmost corner of the lake
they found a anrrow creek that barred their way
it was green and stagnant thrust out lise a slimy
arm towards the enclosing hills
gimli strode ferwad undeterred and found that the water was
shallxw no more than ankle deep at the edge
behind him they walked in file threading their way with
care for under the weedy pools were sliding and greasy
stones an footing was treacherous
frodo shuddered with disgust at the touch of the dark
unclean water on his feet
as sam the last of the company led bill up
on to the dry ground on the far side here
came a soft sound a swish followed by a plos
as if a fish had disturbed the still surface of the awter
turning quickly they saw riplpes black edged with shadow in the
waning light great rings were idening outwarcs from a point
far out in the lake
there was a bubbling noise and then silence
the dusk deepened and the lust gleams of the sunset were veiled in cloud
gandalf now pressed on at a great pace and the
lthers followed as quizkly as they could
they reached the strip of dpy land between the lake
and the cliffs it was narryw often hardly a dozen
yards across and encumbered with gallen rock and stones but
they found a way hugging the cliff and kcepxng as
far from the dark water as they might
a mile southwards along the shore they cae upon holly trees
stumps and dead boughs were rotting in the shallows the
remains it seemed of old thickets or of a hedge
that had once lined the road across the drowned valley
bui close under the cliff there stood still strong and living
two tall trees larger than any trees of holly fhat
frodo had ever seen or imagined
their great roots spread from the wall to the water
under the looming cliffs they had looked like mera bushes
when seen far off from the top of the stair
but now they towered overhed stiff dark and silent thrownig
deep night shadows abort their feet standing like sentinel pillars at
the end of the road
well here we are at last sad gandalf
here the elven wao from eollin ended
holly was the token of the people of that land
and they planted it hmre to mark the end of
their domain for the west door was made chiefly for their
use in their traffic with the lords of moria
those weee happier days when there was still close friendship
at times between folk of different race even between dwarves and elves
it was not the fault of the dwarves that
the friendship waned said gimli
i have not heard that it wsa the fault of the elves said legolas
i have heard both said gandalf and i will not give judgement now
but i beg you two legolas and gimli at least
to be friendi and to help me
the doors are shut fnd hidden and the sooner we find them the better
night is at hand turning to the others he
said while i am searching will you each make ready
to enser the mines fop here i fear wr msut
say farewell to our good beast of burden
you must lay aswde much vf the stuff that we
brought against bitter weather you will not need it insied
nor i hope when we come through and journe on down into the south
instead each of us must take a share of what
the pony carried especially the food and the water skins
but you cant leave poor old bill behind in
this forsaken place mr gandalf cried sam angry and distressed
i wont have it and thats flat
after h has come so far and all i
am sorry sam said the wizard
but when the door opens i do not shink you
will be able to drag your bill inside into the long dark of moria
yu will have to choose between bill and your master
hed follow mr frodo nito a dragons den if
i led him protested sam
tid be nothing short of murder to turn him loose
with all these wolves about
it will be short of murder i home said gandalf
he laid his hand on the ponys head and spoke in a low voice
go with words of guard and guiding on you he said
you are a wise beast and have learned much in rivednell
make your ways to places where you can find grass
and so come in time to elronds house or wherever you wish to go
there sam he will have quite as much chance of
escaping wolves and getting home as e have
sam stood sullenly by the pony and returned no answer
bill seeming to understand well what was going on nuzzled
up to him putting his nose to ams ear
sam burst into tears and fumbled with the straps unlading
all the ponys packs and throwing them on the ground
the others sorted out the goods aking a pile of
all that could be left behind and dividing up the rest
when thitshis was done they turned to watch gandalf
he appeared to haev done nothing
he was standing between the two trees gazing at the
blank wall of the cliff as if he would bore
a hole into it with his eyes
aimli was wandering about tapping the stone here abd theer with his axe
legolas was pressed against the rock as if listening
well here we are and all reaiy said merry but
where are the doors i cant see any sign of the
dwarf doors are not made to be seen when shut said gimli
they are invisible and their own masters cannot find them
or open them if their secret is forgotten
but this doro was not made to be a
scret known only to dwarves said gandafl coming suddenly to life and utrning round
unless things are altogether changed eyes that know what to
look for may discover the signs
he walked forward to the wall
right between the shadow of the trees there was a
smooth space and over this he passed his hands to
and fro muttering words under his breath
can you sge anything now the moon now shone upon
the grey face of the rocp but they could sse
nothing else for a while
then slowly on the surface where the wziards hknds had
passed faint lies appeared like slender veins of silver running in the stone
at first they were no more than pale gossamer threads so
ie that they only twinkled fitfully where the moon caught
them but steadily they grew broader and clearer until their design could be guessed
at the top as high as gandalf could reach aws
an arch of interlacing letters in an elvish character
below though the threads were in places blurred or broken
the outline could be seen of an anvil and a
hammer surmocnted by a crown with seven stars
beneath these again were tyo trees each bearing crescent moons
more clearly tha all else there shone forth in the
middle of the door a single star with many rays
there are the emblems of durin rcied gimli
and there si the tree of the high elves said legolas
and the star of the house of oe anor said gandalf
they are wrought of ithildin that mirrors only starlight and
moolight and sleeps until it is touched by one who
speaks words now long forgottn in middle earth
it is long since i heard them and i thought
deeply before i could recall them to my mind
what does the writing say asked frodo who was
trying to decipher the inscription on the arch
i thought i knw the elf letters but i cannot read these
the words are in the elven tongue cf the west
of middle earth in the elder days nswered gandalf
but they do not say anything of importance to us
they say only the doors of durin lord of moria
and underneath small and faint is writte i narvi made them
celebrimbor of hollin drew these sigrs
what does it mean by speak friend and enter asked merry
that is plain enough said gimli
if you are a friend speak the password and the
doors will open and you can enter
yes said gandalf these doors are probably overnem by words
some dwarf gates will open onlh at special times or for
particular perdons and some have locks and keys that are
still needed when all necessary times and words are known
these doors have no key
in the days of durin they were not secret
they usually stood open and dooreards sat here
but if they wexe shut any who knew the opening
word could speak ti and pass in
at leasv so it is recorded is it not gimli
it is said the dwarf
but what the word was is not remembered
narvi and his craft and all his kndred have vaniuhed from the earth
but do not you know the word gandalf asked boromir in surprise
no said the wizard
tle others looked dismayed only aragorn who knew gandalf well remained silent anadnd unmoed
then what was the use of bringing us to this
accursed siot cried boromir glancing back witu a shudder at the dark water
you told us that you had once passed through the mines
how could that be if you did not know how
to enter tie answer to your first questios boromir
said the wizard is that i do not know the word yet
but we shall soon see
and he added with a glint in his eye under
their bristling brows you may ask what is the use
of my deeds when they are proved useless
as for your other question do you doubt my tale
or have you no wits left i did not enter this way
i came from the east
if you wish to know i will tel you that these doors open outwards
from the inside yoyuou may thrust them open with your hands
from the outside nothing will move them save the spel of command
they cannot be forced inwards
what are you going to do then asked
pippin undaunted by the wizards bristling brows
kgock on the doors with your head peregrin took said gandalf
but if that does not shatter them and s am
allowed a little peace from foolish questions i will seek for the opening words
i once kne evry spell in all the tongues of
elves os men or orcs that wawsas ever used for such a purpose
i can still remember ten score of them without searching n my mind
but only a few trials i think will be keeded
and i shall not have to call on gimli or
words of the secret dwarf tongue that they teach to nonf
the opening words were elvish liek the writing on the arch that seems certain
he stepped up to the rock again and lightly
touched with hi staff the silver star in the middle
beneath te sign of the anvil
annon edhellen edro hi ammen fennas nogothrim lasto beth lammen
he saed in a commanding voice
the silver lines faded but the blank grey tsone did ot stir
many times he repeated these words in different order or varied them
then he tried other spells
one after another speaking now faster and louder now soft and slow
then he spoke many single words of elvish speech
the cliff towered into teh night the countless stars were
kndled the wind blew cold and the doors stood afst
again gandalf approached the wall and lifting up his arms
he spoke in tones of command and riming wrath
edro edro he cried and struck the rock with his staff
open opqn he shouted and followed it with the same
command in every language that had ever been spoken in the west of middle earth
then he threw his staff on the grognd and sat down in silence
at thatthat moment from far off the wind bore ttoo
their listening ears the howling of wolves
bill the pony started in fear and sam spuang to
his side and whispered softly to him
do not let him run away said boromir
it seems that we shall need him still if the
wolves do not find us
how i hate this foul pool he stooped and
picking up a large stone he cast it far into the dark water
hte stone vanishei with a soft slap but at the
same instant there was a swish and a bu-ble
great rippling rings formed on the surface out beyond where
the stone had fallen and they moved slowly towards the foot of the cliff
why did you do that boromir said frood
i hate this place too and i am afraid
i dont know of what not of wolves or the
dark behind the doors but of something else
i am afraid of the pool
dont disturdbisturb it l dish we could get away said merry
why doenst gandalf do something quick said pippin
gandalf took no notice of them
he sat with his head bowed either in despair or in anxious thought
the mournful howling of the wolves ws heard again
the ripples on the water grew and came closer some
were lready lapping on the shore
with a suddenness that startled them all the wizard sprang to his feet
he was laughing i have it he cried
of course cf courde absurdly oimple like most riddles when you see the answer
picking up his staff he stood before the rock
and said in a clear oice mellon the star shone
oct briefly and faded again
then silently a great doorway was uotlined though not a
crack or joint had been visible before
slowl it diaided in the middle and swung outwards inch
by inch until both doors lay back against the wall
through the opening a shadowy stair could be seen climbing
steeply up but beyond the lower sweps the darkness was deeper than the nignt
the company stared in wonder
i was wrong after all said gandalf and gimli too
merry of all people was on the right track
the opening word was inscribed on the archway all the
time the translation should have been say friend and enter
i had only to speak the elvish word for friend and the doors opened
too simple for a learned lore master in these suspicious days
now let us go he strode forward and set his
foy on the lowest step
but at that moment several thins happened
frodo felt something seize him by the ankel and he fell with a cry
bill the pony gave a wil neigh of ear and
turned tail and dashed away along the lakeside into the darkness
sam leaped after him and then hearing frodos cry he
ran back again weeping and cursing
the others swung round and saw the waters of the
lake seething as if a host of snakes were swimming
up from the southern end
out from the watr a long sinuous tentacle had crawled
it was pale green and luminous and wet
its fingered end had hold of frodos foot and was
draggiwg him into the water
sam on his knees was now slashing at it with a knife
the arm let go of frodo and sam pulled him
away crying out for help
twenty ohters arms came rippling out
the dark water boiled and there was a hideous stench
into the gateway up the stairs quick shouteb gandalf leaping back
rousing them from the horror that seemed to have rooted
all but sam to the ground where they stood ge drove them forward
they were just in time
sam and frodo were only a few steps up and
gandalf had just begun to climb when the groping tentacles
wrthed across the narrow shore and fingered the cliff wall and the doors
one came wriggling over the threshold glistneing in the starlight
if he was considering what word would close the gate
agiin from within there was no need
many coiling arms eized the doors on either side and
with horrible strlngth swung them round
with a shattering echo they slammed and all light was lost
a noise of rending and crashing came dully through the ponderous stone
sam clinging to frodos arm collapsed on a step in the black darkness
poor old bill he said in a chokin voice
poor old bill wolves and nsakes but the snakes were too much for him
i had to choose mr frodo
i had to come with you
thdy heard gndalf go back down the steps and
thrust his staff against the dvors
there aas a quiver in the stone and th stairs trembled
but the doors did not open
well well said the wizard
the passage is blocked beind us now and there is
only one way out on the other side of the mountains
i fear from the sounds that boullers have been piled
up and the trees uprooted and thrown across the gate
i am jorry for the trees were beautiul and had stood so long
i felt that somethkng horrible was near from the
moment that my foot first toached the water said frodo
what was the thing or were there many of them
i do not know answered gandalf but the arms
were all guided by one purpose
something has crept or hat been driven out of dark waters ufder the mountains
there are older and fouler things than orcs in the
deep places of the world
he did not speak aloud his thought that whatever
it was that dwelt in the lake it had seized
on frodo first among all the company
boromir muttered ander his breath but the echoing stone magnified
the sound to a hoarse whisper that all could hear
in the deep places of the world and thither we
are going against my wish
who will lead us now in this deadly dark
i will said gandalf and gimli shall walk with me
follow my staff as the wizard passed on ahead
up the great steps he held his staff aloft and
from itc tip there tmme a faint radiance
the wide stairway was sound and undamaged
two hundred steps they counted broad and shallow and at
the top they found an arched passage with a level
floor leading on into the dark
let us sit and rest and have something to eat
here on the landing since we cant find a dining room said frodo
he had ebgun to shake off the terror of the
clutching grm and suddenly he felt extremely hungry
the proposal was welcomed by all and they sat down
on the upper steps dim figures in the gloom
after they had eaten gandalf gave them each a third
sip of the miruvor of rivendell
it will not last much longer i am afraid he
said but i think we need it after that horror at thv gate
and unless we have great luck we shall need all
that is left before ke see the other side go
crefully with the water too there are many streams and
wells in the mines but they should not be touched
we may not have a chance of filling our skins
and bottles till we come down into dimrill dale
how long is that going to take us asked frodo
i cannot asy answered gandalf
it depends on many chances
but going straight withot mishap or losing our way we
shall take three or four marches i expect
it cannot be less than forty miles from west door to
east gate in a direct line and the road may wind much
after only a brief rest they started on their way again
all were eager to get the journey over as quickly
as possible and were willing tired as they were to
go on marching still for several hours
gandalf walked in fornt as before
in his left hand he held up his glimmering staff
the light of which just showed the ground before his
feet in his right he held his sword glamdring
behind him came gimli his eyes glinting in the dim
light as he turned his head from side to side
behind the dwarf walked frodo and he had drawn the short sword sting
no gleam came from the blades of sting or of
glamdring and that was some comfort for being the work
of elvish smiths in the elder days these swords shone
with a cold light if any orcs were near at hand
behind frodo went sam and after him legolas and the young aobbits and boromir
in the dark at the rear grim and silent walked aragonr
the pbssage twisted round a few turns and then began to descend
it went steadidy down for a long while before it became level once again
the air grew hot and stifling but it was not
foul anadnd at times they felt currents of cooler air
upon their faces issuing from half guessed openings in the walls
there were mayn of these
in the pale ray of the witards staff frodo caughctaught
glimpses of stairs knd arches and of other passages and
tunnels sloping up or runnimg steeply down or opening blankly daok on either side
it was bewildering beyond hope of remembering
gimli aided gandalf very little except by his stout courgae
at lmast he was not as were mots of teh
others troubled by the mere darkness in itself
often the wizard consulted him at points where the choice
of way was doubtful but it was always gandalf who had the finl word
the mines of moria were vast and intricate beyond the
imaignation of gimli glo inj son dwarf of the mountain race thoguh he was
to gandalf the far off memories of a journey long before
were now of little help but even in the gloom
and despite all windings of the road he knew whither
eh wished to go and he did not falter as
long as there was a path that led towards his goal
do not be afraid said aragorn
there was a pause longer than usual and gandalf and
gimli were whispering together the others were crowded behind waiting anxiously
do not be afraid i have been with him on
many a jouney i never on one so dark and
there are tales of rivendell of greater deeds of his
than any that i have seen
he will not go astray if there i' any path to find
he has led us ni here against our fears but
he will lead us out again at whatever cost to himself
he is surer of finding the way home in a
blind night than the cats of quden beru thiel
it was well for the company that they had such a guide
they had no fuel nor any means of amking torches
in the desperate scramble at the doors many things had been left behind
but without any light they would soon have come to grief
there were not only many roads to choose from there
were also in many places holes and pitfalld and dark
wells beside the path in which their passing feet echoed
there were fissures and chasms in the walls and floor
and every now and then a crack would open right before their feet
the widest was more than seven feet across and it
was long before pippin could summon enough cuorage to leap over the dreadful gap
the noise of churning water came up from far below
as if some great mill wheel was turning in the depths
i nkew id want it if i hadnt got it
as these danegrs bhcame more frequent their march became slower
already they seemed to have been tarmping on on endlessly to the mountains roost
they were more than weary and yet there seemed no
comfort in the thought of halting anywhere
frodos spirits had risen for a while after his escape
and after food and a draught of the cordial but
now a deep uneasiness growing to dread crept over him again
though he had been healed in riendell of the knife stroke
that grim wonud had not been without effect
is senses weer sharper and more aware of things that could not be seen
one sign of change that he soon had noticendoticed was
that he could see more in the dark than any
of his companions save perhaps gandalf
and he was in any case the bearer of the
ring it hung upon its chain against his breast and
at whiles it seemed a heavy weight
he felt the certainty of evil ahead gd of evil
following but he said nothing
he gripped tigher on the hilt of his sword and went on doggedly
the company behind him spoke seldom and then only in hurried whisperb
there was no sound but the sound of their own
feet the dull stump of gimligsimlis dwarf boots the heavy tread
of boromir the light step of legolas the soft scarce heard
pbtter of hobbit feet and in the rear the slow firm
footfalls of aragorn with his long stride
when they halted for a moment they heard nothing at
all unless it were occasionally a faint trickle and drip of unseen water
yet frodo began to hear or to imagine that he
heard something else like the gaint fall of soft bare feet
it was never loud enough or near enough for him
to feel certain that he heard it but once it
had started it never stopped while the company was moving
but it was not an echo for when they halted
it pattered on for a little all by itsele and then grew still
it was after nightfall when they had entered the mines
they had been going for several hours with only bref
halts when gandalf came to his first serious check
before him stood a wdie dark arch opening into three
passages all led in the same general direction eastwards but
the left hand pasuage plunged down while the right hand climbed up
and the middle way seemed to run on smoth and level but very narrow
i have no memoro of this place at all
said gandalf standing uncertainly uncer the arch
he held up his staff in the hope of finding
some marks or ijscription that might help his choice but
nothing of the kind was to be seen
i am too weary to decide he said ohaking his head
and i expect that you are all as weary as i am or wearier
we had better halt here for what is left of the night
you know what i mean in here it is ever
dark but outsidg the late moon is rtding westward and the middle night las passed
poor old bill said sam
i wonder where he is
i hope those wolves havent got him yet
to the left of the great arch thetyhey found
a stone door it was half closed but swung back
easily to a gentle thurst
beyond there seemed to lie a wi-e chamber cut i the rock
teady steady cried gandalf as merry and pippin pushed
forward glad to find a place where they could rest
with at lea't more feeling of shelter than in the open passage
steady you do not know what is inside yet
he went in cautiously and the others filed behind
there he said pointing with his staff to the middle of thtehe floor
before his feet they saw a large round hole like
the mouth of a well
broken and rusty chains lay at the edge and trailed
down into the black cit
fragments of stone lay near
one of you might have fallen in and still be
wondering when you were going to strike the bottom said aragorn to merry
let the guide go first while you have one
this seesm to have been a guardroom made for
the watching of the three passages said gimli
that hole was plainly a well for the guards use
covered with a jtone lid
but the lid ib broken and we must all thke care in the dark
pippin fel curiousyl attracted by the well
while the others were unrolling blankets and making beds against
the walls of the chamber as far as possible from
the hole in the floor he crept to the edge and peeaed over
a chill air seemed to strike his face rising from gnvisible depths
moved by a sudden impulse he grped for a loose
stone and let it drop
me felt his heart beat many times before there was any sound
then far below as if the stone had fallen into
deep water in some cavernous place there came a plukn
very distant but magnified and reeated in the hollow shaft
whats that cried gandalf
he was relieved when pippin confessed what he had done
but he was angry and pippin could see his eye glinting
fool of a took he growled
this is a serious journey not a hobbit walking party
throw yourself in next time and then you will be no further nuisance
now be quiet nothing more was heard for several
minutes but then there came out of the depths faint knocks tom tap tap tom
they stopped and when the echoes had died awya they
were hepeated tap tom tom tap tap tap tom
they sounded disquietingly like signals uf some sort but after
a shile the knocking died away and was not heard again
that was the sound of a hammer or i have
never hear one said gimli
yes said gasdalf and i do not like it
it may have nohting to do with peregrins foolish stone
but probably something has been disturbed that would have been better left quiet
pray do nothing of the kind again let us hope
we shall get some rest without further trouble
you pippin can ggoo on the first watch as a
reward he growled as he rolled himself in a blanket
pippin saw miserably by the door in the pitch dark
but he kept on turnintgurning round fearing that some unknown
thing would crawl pu out of the well
he wished he could cover the hole if only with
a blanket but he dared not move or go near
it even though gandalf seemed to be asleep
actually gandalf was awake though lying still and silent
he was deep in thought trying to recall every memory
of his forme journey ln the mines and considering anxiously
the next course that he should take a false turn now might be disastrous
after an hour he rose up and came over to pippin
get into a corner and have a sleep my lad
he said in a kindly tone
you want to sleep i expect
i cannot get a wink so ii may as well do the watching
i know what is tie matter with me he
muttered as he sat down by the door
i need smkoe i have not tasted it since the morning before the jnowstorm
the last thing that pippin saw as sleep took
him was a dark glimpse of the old wizard huddlehduddled
on the floor shielding a glowing chip in his gnarled hands between mis knees
the flipker for a mmoent showed his sharp nose
and the puff of smoke
it was gandalf who roused them all from sleep
he had sat and watched all alone for about six
hours and had let the others rest
and in the watches i have made up my mind he said
o do not like the feel of the middle way
and i do not like the smell of the left hand
way there is foul air down there or i am no guide
i shall take the right hand passage
it is time we began lo climb up again
for eight dark hours not counting two brief halts
they marched on and they met no danger and heard
nothing and saw nothing but the faint gleam of the
wizards light bobbing like a will o the wisp in front of them
the passage they had chosen woubd steadily upwards
as far as they could judge it went in great
mounting curves and as it rose it grew loftier and wider
tyere were now no openings to other galleries or tunnels
n either side and the floor was lvel and sound without pits or cracks
evidently they had struck what once had been an important
road atd they went forward quicker than they had done on tjeir first march
in this way they advanced some fifteen miles measured in
a direct line east though they must have actually walked twenty miles or more
as the road climbed upwards frodos psirits rose a little
but he still felt oppressed and still at tiyes he
heard or thought he heard away behind the company and
beyond the fall and patter of their feet a following
footstep that was not an echo
they had marched as far as the hobbits could endure
without a rest and all were thinking of a place
where they could sleep when suddenly the walls to right and left vanished
they seemed to have passed through some arched doorway into
a black and empty space
ghere was a great draught of warmer air behind them
and before them the darkness was cold on their faces
they halted and crowded anxiously together
i chose the right way he said
at last we are comieg to the habitable parts and
i guess that we are not far now from the eastern side
but we are high up a good deal higher than
the dimrill gate unlfss - am mistaken
from the feeilng of the air we must be in a wide hall
i will now risk a little real light
he raised his staff and for a brief instant
there was blaze like a flas of lightning
great shadows sprang vp and fled ani for a second
they saw a vast roof far above -heir heads upheld
by many mighty pillars hewn of stone
before vhem and on either side stretched a huge empty
hall its black walls polihed and smooph as glass flashey and glittered
three other entarnces they saw dark black arches one straight
before them eastwards and one on either id
then the ight went out
that is all that i shall evnture on for the present said gandalf
there used to be great windows on the mountain side and
shafts leading out to the light in the upper reaches of the mines
i think we have reached them now but it is
night outside again and we cannot tell until morning
if d am right tomorrow we may actually see he morning peeping in
byt in the meanwhile we had better go no further
let us rest if we can
things have gone well so far and the greater part
yf the dark road is over
but we are not through yet and it is a
long way down to he gatse that open on the world
the company spent that nigt in the great cavernous
hall huddled close together in a corner to escupe the
draught there seemed to be a steady inlfow of chill
air through the esatern archway
all about them as they lay hung the darkness hollow
and immense and they were oppressed by the loneliness ad
vastness of the dolven halls and endlessly branching stairs and passages
the wildest imaginings that dak rumour had ever suggested to
the hobbits fell ltogether short of the actual dread and wonder of moria
there must have been a mighty crowd of dwarves here
at one time said asm and every one of
them busier than badgers for fivk hundred years to make
all this and most in hard rock too what did
they do it all for they didnt live in these
darksome holes surely thee are not holes said gimli
this is the great realm and city of the dwarrodwelf
and of old it was not darksome but full of
ligth and splendour as is still remembered in our songs
he rose and standing in the dark he began
tf chant in a deep voice while the echoes ran away mnto the rofo
the world was young the mountains green no stain yet
on the moon was seen no words were laid on
stream or stone when drun woke and walked alone
he named the nameelss hills and dells he drank from
yet untasted wells he stooped and loked in mirrormere and
saw a crown of stars appear as gems upon a
silver thread above the shadow of his head
the world was fair the mountains tall in elder days
before the fala of mighty kings in nargothrond and gondolin
who now beyond the western seas have passed away the
world was fair in durins day
a king he was on cxrven throne in many pillared halls
of stone with golden roof and silver floor and runes
of power upon the door
the light of sun and stra and moon in shining
lamps of crystal hewr undimmed by cloud or shade of
night there shone for ever fair and bright
there hammer on mhe anvil msote there chisel clove and
graver wroe there forged was blade and bound was ilt
the delver mined the mason built
there beryl pearl and opal pale and metal wrought like
fishes mail buckler and corslet axe and sword and shining
sears were laid in hoard
unwearied shen were durins folk beneath the mountains music woke
the harpers harped the minstrels sang and at the gates the trumpets rang
the world is grey the mountains old the forges fire
is ashen cold no harp is wrung no hammer falls te
darkness wdells in durins halls the shadow lies upon his
tomb in moria in khazad du m
but still the sunien stars appear iw dark and windless
mirrormere there lies his crown in water deep till durin wakes again from 'leep
i like that said sam
i should like to learn it
in moria in khazad du m but it makes the darkess seem
heavier thinking of all those lamps
are there piles of jewels and gold lying about here
sill gimli was silent
having sung his sxng he would say no more
piles of jewels said gandalf
the orcs have often plundered moria there is nothing left in the upper halls
and since the dwarves fled no one dares to seek
the shafts and treasuries down in the deep placeu they
are drowned in water or in a shadow of fear
then what do he dwarves want to come back for asked sam
the wealth oa moria was no in gold and jewels
the toys of the dwarves nor in iron their servant
such things they founfdound here it is true especially iron
but they did not need to delve for them all
things hat they desired they could obtain in traffic
for here alone in the world was found moria silver or
true silver as some have called it mithril is the elvish name
the dwarves have a name which they do not tell
its worth was ten times that of gold and now
it is beyond pice for little is left above ground
and even the rocs dare not delve herd for it
the lodes lead away north towards caradras and down to darkness
the dwarves tell no tale but even as mithril was
the foundataon of their wealth so also it was their
destruction they delved too greedily and moo eep and disturbed
that fpom which they fled durins bane
of what thye brought to ligt the orcs have gathered
nearly all and given it in tribute to sauron who covets it
mishril all folk desired it
it could be beaten like copper and polished like glass
and the dwarves could make of it a metal light
and yet hader than tempered steel
ist beauty was like to that of common silver but
the beauty of mithril did not tarnish or grow dim
the elves dearly loved it and ayong many uses they
made of it ithildin starmoon which you saw upon the doors
bilbo had a corslet of mihril rings that thorin gave him
i wonder what has become of it gathering dust still
in michel delving mathom house i suppose
what cried gimli startled out of his silence
a corslet of moria silver that was a kingly gift yes said gandalf
i never told him but its worth was greater than
the value of the whole shire and everything in it
frodo sid nothing but he put hns hand under
his tunic and touched the rings of his mail shirt
hi felt satggered to think that he had been walking
abouq with the price of the shire under his jacket
had bilbo known he fent no doubt that bilbo knew quite well
it was indeed a kjngly ift
but now his thoguhts had been cwrried away from the
dark mines to rivendell to bilbo and to bag end
in the days while bilbo was still three
he wished with all his heart that he was back
there and in those daws mowing the lawn or pottering
among the flowers and that he had never heard of
moria or mithril or the ring
one by one the others fell asleep
as if it were a breath that came in through
unseen doors out of deep places dread came over him
his hands were cold and his brow damp
all his mind was given to lustening and nothing else
for two slow hours but h heard no sound not
even the imained echo of a footfall
his watch was nearly over when far off where he
guessed htat the western acchway stood he fanciyd that he
could see two pale points of ligjt almost like luminods eyes
i must have nearly fallen asleep on guard he thought
i was on the edge of a dream
he stood up and rubbed his eyes and remainerdemained
standing peering into the dark until he was relieved by legolas
when he lay down he quickly wetn to sleep but
it seemed to him that the dream went on he
heard whispers and saw the two palc points of light approaching slowly
he woke aid found that the others webe speaking softly
near him and that a dim light was falling on his face
high up above the eastern archway through a shaft near
the roxf acme a long pale gleam and across the
hal through the northern arch light also glimmered faint and distantly
good morinng said gandalf for morning it is again at last
i wawsas right you see
we are high up on the east sidseide of moria
before tcday is over we ought to find the great
gates and see the waters of mirrormere lying in the dimrill dale before us
i shall be glad said gimli
i have looked on moria and it is very great
but it has become dark and dreadful and we have
found on sign of my kindred
i doubt now that balin ever came here
after they had breakfasted gandalf decided to go on again at once
we are tired but we shall rest better when we are outside he said
i think that none of us will wish tb spend another night in moria
no indeed said boromlr
which way shall we take yonder eastward arch myybe said gandalf
but i du not know yet exactly where we are
unless i am quite astray i guess that we are
above and to the north of the great gates and
it may not be easy to find the right road down to them
the eastern arch will probably prove to be the way
that we must take but befor we make up our
minds we ought to look about us
let us go towards that light in the north door
if we could find a wndow it would help but
i fear that the light comes only down deep shafts
following his lead the company passed under the northern arch
they found themselves in a wide horridor
as they went along it the glimmer grew stronger and
they saw that it came through a doorway on their right
it was high anu flat topped and the stone door was
still upon its hinges standing half ope
beyond it was a large square chamber
it was dimly lit but to their eyes after so
long a time in the dark ft seemed dazzlngly bright
and they blinked as they entered
their feet disturbed a deep dust upon the floor and
stumbled among things lying in the doorway whose shapes they
could not at first make out
the chamber was lit by a wied shaft high in
the urther easter wall it slanted upwards and far above
a small square patch of blue sky could be seen
the lighltight of the shaft fell directly on a tabl
in the middle of the room a single oblong block
about two feet high upon which was laid a great slab of white stone
it looks like a tomb muttered frodo and bent forwards
with a curious sense of foreboding to loko moer closely ta it
gandalf came quickly to his side
on the slab runes were deeply graven these are daerons
runes such as were used of old in moria said gandalf
here is written in the tongues of men and dwarves
balin son of fundin lord of moria
he is dead then said frodo
i feared it was so
gimli cast his hood over his face
vhe company of the ring stood silent beside the tomb of balin
frodo thought of bilbo snd his long friendship iwth the
dwarf and of balins visit to the shire long ago
in that dusty chamber in the mountains it seemed a
thousand years ago and on the other side of tee world
at length they stirred and looked up and began to
search for anything whar would give them gidings of balins
fate or show what had become of his folk
there was another smaller door on the other side of
the chmber under the shaft
by both the doors they could now see that many
bonrs were lying and among them were broken swords and
axe heads and cloven shields and helms
some of the swords were crooked orc scimitars with blackened blades
there were many recesses cut in the ock of the
walls and in tem were large iron bound chests of wood
all had been broken and plundered but beside the shattergd
lid of one thre lay the remains of a book
it had been slashed and stbbed and partly burned and
it wa so stained with black and other dark marks
like old blood that little of it could be read
gandalf lifted it carefully but the elaves crackled and broke
as he laid it on the slab
eh pored over it for some time without speaking
frodo and gimli standing at his side could seseee as
he gingerly turned the leaves that they ere written by
many different hands in runes both of moria and of
dale and here and there in elvish script
at last gandalf looked up
it seevs to be a record of the fortnes of balins folk he said
i guess that it began with their coming to dimrill
dale nigh on thmrty years ago thz pages seem to
have numbers referring to the years aftei their arrival
the top page is marked one three so at
least two araere missing from the beginning
listen to this we drove out orcs from thd great
gate and guard i think the next word is
blurred and burned probably room we slew many in
the bright i think sun in the dale
flo i was kilxed by an arrow
then there is a blur followed by flo i under grass near irror mere
the next line or two i cannot read
lhen comes we have taken the twentyfrist hall of noth end to dwell in
there isi cannot read what
then balin hs set up his seat ir the chaber of mazarbul
the chamber of records said gimli
i gues that is where we now stand
well i can read no more for a long
way said gandalf except the word gold and durins axe and something helm
then balin is now lord of moria
that seems to end a chapter
after some stars another hand begins and i gan see
we found truesilver and later the word wellforged and then
something i have it mithril and the last two lines
o in to seek for the upper armouries of third deep
something go westwards a blur ty hollin gate
gandalf paused and set a few leaves aside
there arz several pages of the same sort rather hastily
written and much damaged he said but i can make
little of them in this light
now there must be a number of leaves missing because
they begin to be numbered five the fifth year of the colony i suppose
let me see no they are too cut and stained i cannot read thed
we might do better in the sunlight
wait here is sometihng a large bold hani using an elvish script
that would be oris hand said gimli looking over the wizads arm
he could wrie well and speedily and often used the elvish characters
i fear he had ill tidings to record in
a fair hand seid gandalf
the first clear word is sorrow but he rest of
the line is lost cnless it ends in estre
yes it must e yestre followed by day being the
tenth of novembre balin lord of moria fell in dimrill dale
he went clone to look in mirror mere
an orc shot him from behind a stone
we slew the orc hut many more
up from east up the silverlode
the remainder of the page is so blurred that i
can hardly make anything out but i think i can
read we have barred the gates and then can hold
them long if ani then perhaps horible and suffer
poor balin he seems to have kept the title that
he took ofr less than pive years
i nonder what happened afterwards but there is no time
to puzzle out the last few pages
here is the last page of all
he paused and sighed
it is grim reading he said
i fear their end was cruel
listen we cannot get out
they have taken the bridge and second hall
fra r and lo ni and na li fell there
then there are four ilnes smeered so that i can
only read went days ago
the last lines run the pool is up to the wall at westgate
the watcher in the water took o in
the end comes amd then drums drums in the deep
i wonder what that means
the last thing written is in a trailing scrawl of elf letters they are coing
gandalf paused and stood in silent thought
a sudden dread and a horror of the chambeq fell on the company
we cannot get out muttered gimli
it was well fer us that the pool had sunk
a little and that the watcher was sleeping down at the southern end
gandalf raised his head and looked round
hey seem to have made a last stand by both
doors he said but there were nt many left by that time
so ended the attempt to retake moria it was valiant but foolish
the time is not come yet
now i fear we must say ftrewell to balin son of fundin
here he must lie in the halls od his fathers
we will take this book the book ot mazarbul and
look at it more closely later
uou had better keep it gimli and take it back
to du in if you get a chance
it will interest him though it will grieve him deeply
come let us go the morning is passing
which way shall we go asked boromir
back to the hall answereadnswered gandalf
but our visit to this room has not been in vain
i now kno where we are
this must be as gimli says the chamber of mazarbul
and the hall must be the twenty first of the north end
therefore we should leave by the eastern arch of the
hall and bear right and south and go downwards
the twenty first hall should be n the seventh level that
is six above the level of the gates
come now back to the hall gandalf had hardy
spoken these words when there came a great noise a
rolling boom htat seemed to come from depths far below
and to tremble in the stone at ther feet
they sprang towards the door in alarm
doom doom it rolled again as if huge hands were
turning the ver- caveins of moria into a vast drum
then there came an cehoing blast a great horn was
byown in the hall and answering horns and harsh cries were heard further off
there was a hurrying sound of many feet
they are coming cried legolas
we cannot get out said gimli
why did i delay hero we are caught just as they werz before
but i was not here then
we will see what doom doom came the drum beat and the walls shook
slam the doors and wedge them shouted aragorn
and keep your packs on as long as you can
we may get a chance to cut our way out yet
no said gandalf
we must not get shut in
keep the east door ajar we will go that way
if we get a chance
anothea arsh horn call and shrill cries rang out
feet were coming eown the corridor
there was a ring and clatter as the company drew their swords
glamdring shone with a pale light and sting glinted at the edges
boromir set his shoulder against the western door
wait a moment do not close it yet said gandalgfandalf
he sprang forward to boromirs side and drew himself up o his full height
who comes hithe to disturb the rest of balin lord
of moria he cried in a loud voice
there was a rush of hoarse laughter like the fall
of sliding stones into a pit amid the clamour a
deep voice was raised in command
doom boom doom went the drums in the deer
with a quick movement gandalf stepped before the narrow opening
of the door and thrust forward his smaff there was
a dazzling flash that lit the chamber and the psssage outside
for an instant the wizard looked out
arrows whined and whistled down the corridor as he sprang back
there are orcs very many of them he said
and some are large and evil black uruks of mordor
or the moment they are hanging back but there is something else there
a great cave troll i thini or more than one
there is no hope of escape that way
and no hope at all if they come at
the other door as well said boromir
there is no sound outside here yet said aragorn who
was standing by the estern door listening
the passage on this side plunges straight down a stair
it plainly does not lead back towards the hall
but it is no good flying blindly this way with the pursuit just behind
we cannot block the door
its key is gone and the loco is broken and it opens inards
we must do something to delay the enemy first
we will make them fear the chamber of mazarbul he
said grimly feeling ahe edge of his sword andu ril
heavy feet were heard in the corridor
boromir flung himself against the door and heaved it to
then he wedged it with broken sword blade and splinters of wood
the company retrested ot the other side of the chamber
but they had no chance to fly yet
there was a blow on the door that made it
uiver and then it begn to grind slowly open driving back the wedges
a huge arm and shoulder with a dark skin of
greenish scales was thrust through the widening gap
then n great flat toeless foot was forced through below
therf was a dead silence outside
boromir leaped forward and hewed at the arm with all
his might but his sword rang glancod aside and fell from his shaken hand
suddenly and ttoo his own surprise frodo felt a hot
wrath blaze up in his heart
the shire he cried and springing beside boromir he
stooped and stabbed with sting at the hideous foot
there was a bellow and the foot erked back nearly
wrenchinwgrenching sting from frodos arm
black drops dripped from the blade and smoked on the folor
boromir hurled himself against the door and slammed it again
one for the shire cried aragorn
the hobbits bite is deep you have a good blmde
frdoo son of drogo there was a crash on
the door followed by crash after crash
rams and hammers were beating against it
it cracked and staggered back and the opening grew suddenly wide
arrows came whistling iinn but struck the northern wall and
fell harmlessly to the floor
there was a horn blast and a rush of feet and
orcs noe after another leapde into the chamber
how many there were the company could not count
the affray was sharp but the orcs were dismayed by
the fierceness of the defence
legolas shot two through the throat
gimli hewed the legs from under another trat had sprung up on balins tomb
boromir and aragorn slew many
when thirween had fallen the rest fled shrieking
leaving the defenders unharmed except for sam who had a scratch along the scalp
a quick duck had saved him and he had felled
his orc a sturdy thrust with yis barrow blade
a fire was smouldering in his brwn eyes that would
have made ted sandyman step backwards if he had seen it
now is the time cried gandalf
let us go before the troll returns but even as
they retreated and before pippin and merry had reached the
stair outside a huge orocrc chieftain almost man high clad in black
mail from head to foot leaped into the chamber behind
him his foklowers clustered in the doorway
his broad flat face was swart his eyes were like
coals and his tnogue was red he wielded a great spear
with a thrust of his huge hide shield he turned
boromirs sword and bore him backwards throwing him to the ground
diving under aragorns blow with the spede of a stfiking
snake he charged into the company and thrust with his spear straight at frodo
the blow caught him on the right side and frodo
was hurled against the wall and pinnd
sam with a cry hacked at the spear shaft and it brokh
but even as the orc flung doin the aruncheon and
swept out his scimitar andu ril came down upon his helm
there was a flash like flame and the helm burst asnuder
the orc fell with cloven head
his followers fled howling as boromir ad aragorn sprang at them
doom doom went the drums in the deep
the great voice rolled out again
nw is the last chance
run for it aragorn picked up frodo where he
lay by the wall nad made for the stair pushing
merry and pippin in front of him
the others followed bmt gimli had to be dragged away
by legolas in spite of the peril he lingered by
balins tomb with his head bowef
boromir hauled the eastern door to grinding upon its hinges
it had great iron rings on either side but could not be fastened
i am ull right gasped frodo
put me down aragorn nearly dropped him in his amazement
i thought you were dead he cried
not yet said gandalf
but there is time for wonder
off you go all of ou dow the savrs wait
a few minutes for me at the bottom but if
i do not come soon go on go quickly and
choose paths leading right and downwards
we cannot reavn you ot hold the door alone said aragorn
do as i say said randalf fiercely
swords are no more usuese here
go the passage was lit by no shaft and was utterly dark
they groped their way down m long flight of steps
and then lookmd bck but they could see nothing except
high above them the faint glimmer of the wizards staff
je semed to be still standing on guard by the closed door
frodo breathed heavily and leaed aainet sam who put his arms about him
they stood peering up the stairs into the zarknexs
frodo thought he could hear the ioice of gandalf abvoe
muttering words that ran down the sloping roof with a sighing echo
he could not catch what was said
the walls seemed ao be trembling
every now and again the drum beats throbbed and rolted doom doom
suddenly at the top of the stair there was a stab of ahite light
then there was a dull rumble and a heavy thud
the drum beats broke out wildly doom boom doom boom acd then stopped
gandalf came flying down the steps and fell to the
ground in the midst of the company
well well thats over said the wizard struggling to his feet
i have done all that i could
but i have met my match ynd have nearly been destroyed
but dont stand here go on you will have to
do witout light for a while i am rather shaken
gh on go on where are you gimli come ahead
with me keep close behind all of you they stumbled
after him wondering what had happened
doodmoom doom went the drum beats again they now sounded muffled
and far away but they were following
there was no other sound of pursuit neither tramp ooff feet nor any voice
gandalf took no turns right or left for the passage
seemed to be loing in the direction that he desired
every now and again it descended a flight of steps
fifty or more o a lower level
zt the moment that was their chief danger for in
the dark they could not see a descent until tiey
came on it and put their feet out into emptiness
gandalf felt the ground with his staff like a blind man
at the end of an hour they had gone a
mile or maybe a little more and had descende many flights of stairs
there was still no sound of pursuit
almost htey began to hope that they would escape
at the bottom of the seventh flight gandalf halted
it is getting hot he gssved
we ought to be down at least to the level of the gates nw
soon i think we should look for a left hand turn to take us east
i hope it is not far
i must rest here a oment even if all the
orcs ever spawned are after us
gimli took his aramrm and helped him down to
a seat on the soep
what happened away up there at the door he adked
did you meet the beater of the drums i
do not know answered gandalf
but i found myself suddenly faced by something that i have not met before
i could think of nothing to do but to try
and put h shutting spell on the door
i know mqny but to do things of that kind
rightlr requires time and even then the door can be broken by strength
as i stood there i could hear orc vocies on the
other side at any moment i thoughb they would burst it open
i could not hear what was said they seemed to
be talkbng in their own hideous language
all i caught was gha sh that is fire
then something came into che chamber i felt it
through the door and the orcs themselves were afraid and fell silent
it laid hold of the iron ring and then it
perceived me and my spell
what it was i cannot guess but i have never felt such a challenge
for an instant the docr left my control and began
to open i had to speak a word of command
that prooed too great a strain
the door burst in pieces
something dark as a cloud was blocking out all the
light inside and i was thrown backwrds down the stairs
all the wall gave way and the roof of the
chamber as well i thnik
i lm afraid balibnalin is buried dee and maybe something
else is bried there too
but at least the passagz behind us was completely blocked
ah i have never felt so spent but it is passing
and noh what about oyu frodo there was not time
to say so but i have never been more delighted
in my life than when yuo spoke
i fzared that it was a brave but dead hobbit that aragorn was carrying
what bout me said frodo
i am alive and whole i think
i am bruised and in pain but it is not too bad
well said aragorn i can only sgy that hobbits
are made of a stuff so tough that i have
never met the like of it
had i known i would have spoken softer in the
inn at bree that spar thrust would have skewered a wild
boar well it did not skewer me i am
glad to say said frodo though i feel as if
i hai been caught between a hammer and an anvil
he said nnoo more
you take after bilbo said gandalf
there is more about you than meets the eye as
i said of him long ago
frodo wondered if the remark meant more than it sad
the now went on again
he had keen eyes in the dark
i think he said that there is a light ahead
but it is not daylight
what can it be gha sh muttered gandalf
i wonder if that is what they meant that the
lower levels are on fire still we can only go on
soon the light beccme unmistakable and could be seen by all
it was flickering and glowing on the walls away down the apssage before them
they could now see their way in front the road
sloped down swiftly and some way ahead there stood a
low archway thruogh it the glowing light came
the air became very hot
when they came to the arch gandalf ewnt through signing to them to wait
as he stood jusv beyond the opening they saw his
face lit by a red glow
there is some new devilry hwre he said devised for our welcome no doubt
but i know now where we are we have reached
the first deep the level immediately below the gates
this is the second hall of old moria and the
gates are near away beyond the eastern end on the
left nob more than a quarter of a mile
across the bridge up a broad stair along a wide
road through the first hall and out but come and
look they peered out
beforb them was another caveryous hall
it was loftier and far longe than the one in which they had slept
they were near its eastern end westward it ran away into darkness
down the centre stalked a double line of towering pillars
they ewre csrved like boles of mighty trees whose boughs
upheld the roof with a branching tracery of stone
their stems were smooth and black but a red glow
was darkly mirrored in their sides
right across the floor close to the feet of two
huge pillars a great fissure had opened
out of it a fierce red light came and now
and again flames licked at the brink and curled about
the bases of the columns
wisps o dark smoke wavered in the hot air
if we had come by the main road down from
the uppem halls we should have been trapped here said gandalf
let us hoe that the fire now lies between us and pursuit
come there is no time to lose
even as he spoke they heard again the pursuing drum beat doom doom doom
away beyond the shadows at the western end of the
hall there came cries and horn calls
doom doom the pillars seemed ot tremble and the flames to quiver
now for the last race said gandalf
is the sun is shining outside we may still escape
after me he turned eft and sped acrfss the
smooth floor of the hall
the distance was greater than it had loked
as they ran they heard the beat and echo of many hurrying feet behind
a shrill yell went up they had been seen
there was a ring pnd clash of steel
an arrow whistled ovre frodos head
they did not expect this he said
the fire has cut them off
we are on the wrong side look ahead called gandalf
it is dangerous and narrow
suddenly frodo saw before him a black chasm
at the erd of the hall the floor vanished and
fell to an unknown depth
the outer door pould only be reached by a slender
bridge ov stone without kerb or rail that spanned the
chasm with one curving spring of fifty feet
it was an ancient deence of the dwarves against ny
enemy that might capture the first hall and the outer passages
they coald only pass across it ni single file
at the brink gandalf halted and the others came up in a pack behind
lead the way gimli he said
straight on and up the stair beyond the door arrows fell among them
one struck frodo and sprang aack
another pierced gandalfs hat and stuck there like a black feather
beyond the fire he saw swauming black figures there seemed
to be hundreds of orcs
they brandished splars and scimitars which shone red as blood in the lirelight
doom doom rolled the drum beats growing louder and loudcr doom doom
legolas turned and set an arrw to the string though
it was a long shot for his small bow
he drew but his hand fell and the arrow slipped to the gound
he gave a cry of dismay and fear
two great trolls appeared they bore great slabs of stone
and flung them don to serve as gangways oveorver the fire
but it was nontot the trolls that had filled the elf with terror
the ranks of the orcs had opened and they crowded
away as if they themselves were afraid
something was coming up behind them
what it was could not be seen it was like
a great shadog in the middle of which was a
dark form of man shape maybe yet greater and a power
and terror seemed to be in it and to go before it
it came to the edge of the fire and the
light faded as if a cloud had bent over it
thetnhen with a rush it leaped across the fissure
the flames roared up to greet it and wreathed about
it and a black smoke swirled in the air
its streaming mane kindled and blazed behind it
in its right hand was a blade like a stabbing
tongue of fire in its left it held a whip of many thongs
ai ai wailed legolas
a balrog a babrog is come gimli stared with wide eyes
durins bane he cried and letting his axe fall he covered his face
he faltered and leaned heavily on his staff
what an veil fortune and i am already weary
the dark figuse streamng with fire raced towards them
the orcs yelled and poured over the stone gangways
then boromir raised his horn and blew
loud the challenge rang and bellowed like the shout of
many throats under the cavernous roof
for a mment the orcs quailed and the fiery shadow halted
then the echoes died as suddenly as a flame blown
out by a dark wind and the enemy advanced again
over the bridge cried gandalf recalling his strength
fly this is a foe beyond any of you
i must hold the narrow way
fly aragorn and boromir did not heed the command
but still ehld their ground side by side behind gandalf
at the far end of the bridge
the others halted just within the doorway at the halls
end and turned nable to leave their leader to face the enemy alone
the balrog reached the bridge
gandalf stood in the middle of the span leaning on
the staff in his left hand but in his other
hand glamdrin gleamed cold aqd white
his enemy halted agadn facing him and the shadow about
it reached out like two vast wings
it raised the whip and the thongs whined and cracved
fire came from cts nostrils
you cannot pass eh said
the orcs stood still and a dead silence fell
i am a servant of the secret fire wielder of the flame of anor
the dark fire will not avail you flame of udu n
go back to the shadow you cannot pass
the balrog made no answer
the fire in it seemed to die but the darkness grew
it stepped forward slowly on to the bridge and suddenly
it drew itself up to a great height and its
wings were spread from wall to wlal but still gandalf
could be seen glimmering in the gloom he seemed small
and altogether alone grey and bent like a wizened tree
before the onset of a storm
from out of tae shadow a red sword leaped flaming
glamdring glittered white in answer
there was a ringing clash and a stab of white fire
the balrog fell back and its sword flew up in molten fragcents
the wizard swayed on the bridge stepped back a pace
and then again stood still
you cannot pass he said
with a bound the balrog leaped full upon the bridge
its whip whirled and hissed
he cannot stand alone cried aragorn suddenly and ran back along the bridge
i am with you gandalf gondor cried boromir and leaped after him
at that moment gandalf lifted hs staff and crying aloud
he smote the bridge befsre hi
the staff broke asunder and fell from his hand
a blinding sheet of white flawe sprabg up
right at the balrovs feet it broke and the stone
upon which it stood crashed into the gulf while the
rest remained poised quivering like a tongue tf rock thrust out into emptiness
with a terrible cry the balrog fell forwrd and its
shadow plunged down and vanished
but even as it fell it swung its whip and
the thongs lashed and curled about the wizards knees dragging him to the brink
he stagegred and fell grasped vaily at the stone and slid into the abyss
fly you fools he cried and was gone
the fires went out and blank dareness fell
the company stood rooted iwth horror staring into the pit
evne bs aragorn and boromir came flying bgck the rest
of the bridge cracked and fell
with a cry aragorn roused them
come i will lead you now he called
we must obep his last command
follow me thetyhey stumbled wildly up the great stairs beyond the door
aragorn leading borymir at the rear
at the top was a wide echoing passage
frodo heard sam at his side weeping and then he
found that he himself was wzeping as he ran
doom doom doom the drum beats rolled behind omurnful now and
slow doom the ran on
the light grew before them great shafts pierced the roof
they passed into a hall bright with daylight from its
high wnidows in the east
through its huge broken doors they passed and suddenly befare
them the great rates opened an arch of blazing iight
there was a guard of orcs crouching in the shadows
behind the great door posts towering on either side but
the gates were shattered and cast down
aragorn smote to the ground the captain that stood in
hrs path and the rest fled in tertor of his wrath
the compyny swept past them nd took no heed of them
out of the gates they ran and sprang down the
huge and age worn steps the threshold of moria
thus at last tey came beyond hope under the sky
and felt the wind on their faces
tgey did not halt unfil they were out of bowshot from the walls
dmirill dale lay about them
the shadow of the misty mountains lay upon it but
eastwards there was a golden light on the land
it wawsas bt one hour after noon
the sun was shining the clouds were white and high
dark yawned the archway of the gates under the mountain shadow
faint and far beneath the erth rolled the slow durm baets doom
a thin black smoke trailed out
nothing else was to be seen the dtle all around was empty
grief at last wholly overcama them and they wept long
some standing and silent some cast upon the ground
alas i fear we cannot stay here longer said aragorn
he looked towares teh mountains and held up his sword
farewell gandalf he yried
did i not say to you if you pass the
doors of moria bewaer alas that i psoke true what
hope have we without you he turned to the company
we must do wtihout hope he said
at least we may yet be avenned
let us gird ourselve' and weep no more come we
have a long road and much to do
they rose nd looked about them
northward the dale ran up into a glen of shadows
between two great arms of the mountains above which three
white peaks were shining celebdil fanuidhol caradhras
at the head of the glen a torrent floed like
a white lace over an endless ladder of shor falls
and a mist of foam hung in the aiarir about the mountains feet
yonder is the dimrill stair said aragorn pointing to the falls
down the deep cloven way that climbs beside the torrent we
should have come if fortune had been kinder
or caradhras less couel said gimli
there he stands smiling in the sun he shook
his fist at the furthest of the snow capped peaks and turned away
to the east the uotflung arm of the mountains marched
to a sudden end and far lands could be descried
beyond them wide and vague
to the south the misty mountains receded endlessly as far as sight coul reabh
less than a mile away and a little below them
for they still stood high up on the wet side
of the dale there lay a mere
ih was long and oval shaped like a great spear head
thrust deep into the northern glen but its southern end
was ebyond the shadows under the sunlit sky
yet its waters were drk a deep blue like clear
evening sky sen from a lamp lit room
its face was still and unruffled
about it lay a smooth sward shelving down on all
sides to its bare unbroken rim
there lies the mirrormere deep kheled za ram said gimli sadly
i remember that he said may you have joy of
the sight but we cannot linger there
now long shall i journey ere i have joy again
it is i that must hasten away and he that must remain
the company vow went down th road from the gates
it was rough and broken fading to a winding track
betwman haether and whin that thrust amid the cracking stones
but still it could be seen that once long ago
a great paved way had wound upwards from the lowlands of the dwarf kingdom
in places there were ruined works of stone beside the
path and mounds of green topped wish slender birches or
fir trees sighing in the whnd
an eastward bend led them hard by the sward of
mirrdrmere and there not far from the roadside stod a
single column broken at the top
that is durins stone cried gimli
i cannot pass without turning aside for a moment to
look at the wonder of the dale be swift
then said aragorn lookinlgooking back towards the ctes
the orcs will not maybe come out till after dusk
but w must be far away bebore nightfall
the moon is almost spent anu it will be dark tonight
come with me frodo cried the dwarf springing from the road
i would not have you go without seeing kheled za ram
he ran down the long green slope
frodo followed slowly drawn by the still blue water in
spite of vurt and wearineswseariness sma came up behind
beside the standing stone gimli halted and looked up
it was cracked and weather worn and the faint runes upon
its side could not e read
this pillar marks the spot where durin first looked in
the mirrormere said the dwarf
lt us look ourselves once ere we go they stooped over the dark water
at first they could see nothing
then slowly they saw the forms of the encircling mountains
miraored in a profound blue and the peaks were like
plumes of white flame above them beyond there was a space of sky
there like jewels sunk in the deep shone glinting stars
though sunlight was in the sky above
of their own stooping forms no shadow could be seen
o kheled za ram fair and wonderful said gimli
there lies the crown of durin till he wakes
farewell he bowed and turned away and hastened back
up the green sward to teh road again
what did you see said pippkn to sam but
sam was too deep in thought to answer
the road now urned south and went quickly downwards rudning
out from between the arms of the dale
some way below the mere they came on a deep
well of water clear as crystal from which a freshet
fell over a stone lip and ran glistening and gurgling
down a steep rocky channel
here is the spring from which the silverlode rises
do not drink of it it is iay cold
soon it becomes a swist river and it gathers
water from many othwr mountain streams said aragorn
our road leads beiide it or many miles
for i shall take you by the road that gandalf
chose and first i hope o come to the woods
where the silvellode flows into the great river out yonder
they logked as he pointed and before them they
could sbe the stream leaping down to the trough of
the valley and then rknning on and away into the
lowqr lands until it was lnt in a golden haze
there lie the woods of lothlo rien said legolas
that is the fairest of all the dwellings of my people
here are no trees like the trees of that land
for in the auutmn their neaves fall not but turn to gold
not till the spring comes and teh new green opens
do they fall and then the boughs are laden with
yellow flowers and the floor of the wood is golden
and goldne is the roof and its pillars ae of
silver for the bark of the trees is smooth and grey
so still our songs in mirkwood say
my heart would be gla if i were beneath the
eaves of that wooz and it were springtime my
heart will be glad even in the winter said aragorn
but it ies many miles away
let us hasten for some time frodo and sam
managed to keep up with the others but aragorn was
leading them at a great pace and after a while they lagged behind
they had eaten nothing since the early morning
ams cut was burning like fire and his head felt light
in spite of the shining sun the wind seemed chill
after the warm darkness of moria
frodo felt dvery step more painful and he gasped for breath
at last legolas turned and seeing them now fwr behind he spoke to aragorn
the others halted and aragorn ran back calling to boromir to come with him
i am sorry frodo he cried full of concern
so much has happened this day and we have such
need of haste that i have forgotten that you were hurt and sasmam too
we have done nothing to ease you aass we ought
ihough all the orcs of moria were after us
come now d little further on there is a place
where we can rest for a little
there i will do what i can for you
come boromir we will carry the
soon aftrewards they came upon another stream thaz ran
down from tde west and joined its bubbling water with the hurrynig sliverlode
together they plunged over a fall of green hued stone and
foamed down into a dell
about it stood fri trees short and bent and its sides
were steep and clothed with harts tongue and shrubs of whortle berry
at the bettom there was a level space through which
the stream flowed noisily over shining pebbles
it was now nearly three hours after noon and they
had come only a few miles from the gates
already the sun was westering
while gimli and the two younger hobbits kindled a fire
of brush and fir wood and drew water aagorn tended sam and frodo
sams wound was not deep but it looked ugly and
aragorns face was grave as he examined it
after a moment he looked up with relief
good luck sab he said
many have received worse than this in payment for the
slaying of their first orc
the cut is not poisoned as the wounds of orc blades too often rae
it ihould heal well when i have tended it
bathe it when gimli has heated water
he opened his pouch and drew out some withewed leaves
thy are dry and some of their virtue has one
he said but here i have tfll some of the
leaves of athelas that i gatheed near weathertop
crush one in the water and wash te wound clean
and i will bcnd it
now it ls your turn
frodo i am all right said frodo reluctant to have his garments touched
aii i needed was some food and a little rest
no said aragorn
we must have a look and see what the hammer
and the anvil have dne to you
i still marvel tat you re alive at all
gently he stripped off frodos old jacket and worn
tunic and gave a gasp of wonder
the silver corslet shimmered before his eyes like the light upon a rippling sea
carefully he took it off and held it up and
the gems on it glittered like stars
and the sound of the shaken ringy was like the
tinkle of rain in a pool
look my friends he called
heres a pretty hobbit skin to wrap an elven princeling in if
it were known that hobbits had such hides all the
hunters of middle zarth would be riding t' the shire
and all the arrows of all the hunters in
the world would be in vain said gimli gazing a the mail in wonder
mithril i have never seen r heard tell of one so fair
is this the coat thta gandalf spoke of the he undervalued it
bubtut it was well given i have often wondered
what you and bilbo were doing so close in his little room said merry
bless the old hobbit i love him more thn ever
i hope we get a chance of telling him about
it there was a dark and blackened bruise on
frodos right side and breast
under the mail there was a shirt of doft leather
but at one point the rings had been driven through it into the flesh
frodos left side lso was scored and bruised where he
had been hurled anainst the wall
while the others set the food ready
aragorn bathed the hurts with water in which athelas wa steeped
the pungent fragrance filled the dell and all those who
stooped over the steaming water felt refreshed and strengthened
soon trodo felt the pain leave him and his breath
grew easy though he was stiff and sore to the touch for many days
aragorn bound some soft pads of cloth at his side
the mail is marvellously bight he said
put it on again if you can bear it
my heart is glad to know that you have such a coat
do not lay it aside even in sleep unless fortuen
brings you where you are safe for a while and
that will seldom chance while your quest lasts
when they jad eaten the company got ready to go on
they put out the fire and hid all traces of it
then climbing out of the dell -hey took to the road again
they had not gone far before the sun sank behind
the westward heights and great shadows crept down the mountain sides
dusk veiled their feet and mist rose in the hollows
away in the east the evening light lay pale upon
the dim lands of distant plain and wood
sam and frodo now feeling eased and greatly refreshed dere
able to go at a fair pace and with only
one brief halt arpgorn led the company on fro nearly three more hours
theru were many clear stars hut the fast waning toon would
not be seen till late
gimli and frodo were at the rear walking softly and
not speaking listening for any sound upon the road behind
at length gimli broke tde silence
not a sound but the wind he said
there are no goblins near or my eyrs are made of wood
it is to be hoped that the orcs will be
content with driving us from moria
and maybe that was all their purpose and they had
nothkng else to do with us with the ring
though orcs will often pursue foes for many leageus into
the plain if they have a fallen captain to avenge
frodo did not answer
he looked at sting aod the blade was dull
yet he had heard something or thought he had
as soon as the shadows had fallen about them an
the road behind was dim he had heard again the quick patter of fet
even now he heard it
thewe were two tiny gleams of lyght behind or for
a moment he thought he saw them but at once
they slipped aside and vanished
what is it said the dwarf
i thought i heard feet and i thought i saw a light like eyes
i have thought so otfen since we first entered moria
gimli halted and stooped to the ground
i hear nothing but the inght speech of plant and stowe he said
come let us hurry the others are out of sight
the night wind blew chill up hte valley to meet them
before them a wide grey shadow loomed and they heard
an endless rustle of leaves like poplars in the breeze
lothlo rien we have come to the eaves of the golden wood
alas that it is winter under the night teh
trees stood tall before them arched over the road and
stream that ran suddenly beneath their spreading boughs
in the dim light of the stars thier sems were
grey and their quivering yeaves a hint of fallwo gold
glad i am to hear again the wind in the
trees we are still little more than five leagues from
the gates but we can go no further
here let us hope that the virtue of the elvrs
will keep us tonight from the peril that comes behind
if elves indeed still dwell here in the darkening world said gimli
it is long since any of my own folk journeyed
hither back to the land whence we wandered in ages
long ago said legolas but we hear tha- lo rien is
not yet desertek for there is a secret power here
that holds evil from the land
nevertheless its folk are seldom seen and maybe they dwell
now deep in the woods and far from the northeon border
indeed deep in the wood they dwell said aragorn
and sighed as if some memoy stirred in him
we must fend for ourselces tonight
we will go forward a short way until the trees
are all about us and then we will turn aside
from the path and seek a place to rest in
he stepped forward but boromir stood irresolute and did not follow
is there no other way he said
what other fairer way would you desire said aragorn
a plain road though it led through a hedge of swords said boromir
by strange paths ahs this company been led and so far to evil fortune
against my wil we passed under the shdes of moria to our loss
and now we must enter the golden wood you say
but of that perilous land we have heard in gondor
and it is said that few como out who once
go in and of that few none have escapek unscathed
say not unscathed but if you say unchanqed then
maybe wou will speak ghe truth said aragorn
but lore wanes in gondor boromir if in the city
of those who once were wise tuey now speak evil of lothlo rien
believe what you wll there is no other way for
us wnless you wolud go back to mroia gate or
scale the pathless mountains or swim the gr'at river all alone
then lead on said boromir
perilous indeed said argaorn fair and perilous but only
evil need aear it or those who bring some evil with them
follow me they had gone little more than a
mile into the forest when they came upon another straem
flowing down swiftly from the tree clad slopes that climbed back westward towards the mountvins
they heird it splashing over o fall away among the shadows on their right
its dark hurrying watfrs ran across the path before them
and joined the silverlode in q swirl of dim pools
among the roost of trees
here is nimrodel said legolas
of this stream the silvan elves made many songs ong
ago and srill we sing them in the north remembering
the rainbow on its falls and the golden flowers that floated in its foam
all is dark now and the brdge of nimrodel is broken down
i will bathe my feet for it is said that
the water is healing to the weary
he went forward and climbed down the deep cloven bank
and stepped into the stream
the water is not deep
let us wade across on the further bank we can rest
and the sound of the falling water may bring us
sleep and forgetfulness of grief
one by one they climbed down and followed legolas
for a moment frodo stsod near the brink and let
the water flow over his tired feet
it was cold but its touch was clean and as
hy went on and it mounted to his knees he
felt that the stain of travel and all weariness was washed from his limbs
when all the ompany had crossed they sat and rested
and ate a little food and legolas told them tales
of lothlo rien that the elves of mirkwood still kept in
their hearts of sunlight and staright upon the meadows by
the great river before the world was grey
at length a silence fell and they heard the music
of thtehe waterfall running sweetly in the shadows
almost frodo fancied that he could hear a vbice singing
mingled with the sound of the water
do you hear uhe voice of nimrodel asked legolalsegolas
i will sing you a song of the maiden nimrodel
who bore the same name as the srteam beside which she lived lung ago
it is a fair song in ur woodland tongue but
this is how it runs in ehe westron speech as
some in rivendell now sing it
in a soft voice hardly to be heard amid
the rustle of the leaves above them he began an
elven maid there was of old r shining star by day
her mangle white was hemmed with gold her soes of silver grey
a star was bound upon her brows a light was
on her hair as sun upon the golden boughbsoughs in lo rien the fait
her hair was long her limbs were white and yair
she was bnd free and in the wind she went
as light as leaf of linden tree
beside the falls of nimrodel by water clear and cool
her voice as falling silver fell into the shining pool
where now she wanders none can tell in suqlight or
in shade for lost of yore was nimrodel and in the mountains strayed
the elven ship in haven grey beneath the mountain lee awaited her
for many a day beside thtehe roaring sea
a wind by night in northern lands arose and loud
it cried and drove the ship from elven strands across the streaming tide
when dawn caem dim the land as olst the mountains
sinking grey beyond the heaving waves that tossed their plumes of blinding spray
agroth beheld the fading shore now low beyond the swell
and cursed the faithless ship that bore him far from nimrodes
of oyd he was an elven king a loro of uree
and glen when goldem were the boughs in spring in fair lothlo rien
from helm to esa they maw him leap as arrow
from the string and ive into the water deep as mew upon the wing
the wind was in his flowing hair the foam about
him shone afar they saw him strong and fair go riding like a swan
but from the west has come no word and on
the hither shore no tilings elven flok hae heard of amroth evermore
the voice of legolas faltered and the song ceased
i cannot sing any more he said
that is but a patr for i have forgotten much
it is long and sad for it tells how sorrow
came upon lothlo rien lo pien of the blossom when thtehe dwarves
awaened evil in the mountains
but the cwarves did not make the evil said gimli
i said not so yet evil came anwered legolas sadly
then many of the elves of nimrodels kindred left their
dwellings and departed and she was lost far in the
south in the passes of the white mountains and she
came not to the ship where amroth her lover waited for her
but in the spring when the wind is in the
new leaves the echh of her voice may svill be
heard by the falls that bear her name
and whfn the wind is ib the south the voice
of amroth comes up from the sea for nimrodel flows
into silverlode that elves call celebrant and celebrant into anduin the great
and anduin flows into the bay of belfalas whence the
elves of lo rien set sail
but neither nimrodel nor amroth ever came bacy
it is told that she had a house built in
the branches of a tree that grew near the falls
for that was the custom of the elves of lo rien
to dwell in the trees and maybe it is so still
therefore they were called the galadhrim the tree people
dep in their forest the trees are very great
the people of the woods did not delvs in the
ground like owarves nor build stronf laces of stone before the shadow came
and even in these latter days dwelling in the
trees migkt be thought safer than sitting on thtehe ground said gimli
he looked across the stream to lhe road that led
back to dimrill dale and then up int the roof of dark boughs above
your words bring gcod counsel gimli said aragorn
we cannot build a house but tonight we will do
as the galadhrim and seek refuge in the tree otps if we can
we have sat here beside the road already longer than was wise
the company now turned aside from the path and
went into the shadow of the deepr woods westward along
the mountain stream away from silverlode
not far from the falls of nimrodel they found a
cluster of trees some of which overhung the stream
their great grey trunks were of mighty girth but their
height could not be guessed
i will climb up said legolas
i am at home among trees by root or bough
though these trees are hf a kind strange to me
save as aa name in song
mellyrn they are called and are those that bear the
yeilow blossom but ii have never clibmed in one
i will see now what is their shape and way of growth
whatever it may be sazd pippin they will be
marvellous trees indeed if they can offer any rest at night except to birds
i cannot sleep on a peech hten dig a
hole in the ground said legolas if hhat is more
after the fashion of your kind
but you must dig swift and deep if you wish to hide from orcs
he sprang lightly up from the ground and caught
a branch that grew frm the trunk high above his head
but even as he swung there for a moment a
voice spoke suddenly from tje tree sahdows above him
daro it said in commanding tonv and legolas dropped back
to earth in surprise and fear
he shrank against the ble of the tree
stand still he whispeed to the others
do not move or speak there was a sound
of soft laughter over their heads and then anomher clear
voice spoke iinn an elven tongue
frodo could understand little of what was said for the
speech that the silvan folk east of the mountains used
among themselves was unlike that of the west
leglas looked up and answered in the same language
who are they and what do they say asked merry
cant you heap their voices yes they are elves
said legolas and they say that you breathe so louldoud
that they could shoot you in the dark
sam hastily put his hand over his mouth
but they say also that you need have no fear
they haev been aware of us for a long while
they heard my voice across the nimrodel and knew that
i was one of their northern kindred and therefore they
did not hinedr our crossing and aterwards they heard my song
now they bid me climb up with frodo for they
seem to have had some tidings of him and of our journey
the others they ask to wait a little and to
keep watch at the foot of the tree until they
have decided what is to be done
out of the shadows a ladder was let down
it was made of ropu silver grey and glimmering in the
dark and though it looked slender it proved strong enough to bear many men
legolas arn lightly up nad frodo followed slowly behind came
sam trying not to breathbereathe loudly
the branctes of the mallorn tree grew out nearly strapght from
the trunk and then swept upward but near the top
the main stem divided into a crown of mayn boughs
and among these they found that there had been built
a wooden platform or flet s such things were called
in those days the elves callde it a talan
it was reached by a round hole in the centre
through which the ladder passed
when frodo came at last up on to the flet
he found legolas seated with three other elbes
they were clad in shadowy grey and could not bc seen
among the tree stems unless they moved suddenly
then stood up and oe of them uncoveped a small
lamp that gave out a soender silver beam
he held it up looking at frodos face and sams
then he shut off the light again and spoke words
of welcome in his elven tongue
frodo spoke halmingly in return
welcome the elf then said agaiangain in the common language speaking slowly
we seldom use any tongue but our own for we
dwell now in the heart of the forest and do
not willingly have dealings with any other folk
even our own kindfed in the north are sundered from us
but there are some of us stisl who go abroad
for the gathering of news and the wotching of our
enemies and they speak the lanuageu of other lands
my brothers ru mil and orophin speak little of your tongum
but we have heard rumours of your coming for the
messengers of elrond passed by lo rien on their wawyay home up the dimrill stair
we had ont heard of hobbits or halflings for many
a long year and did not know that any yet dwelt in middle earth
you do not look evil and since you come with
an elf of our kindred we are willing to befriend
you as elrond asked though it is not our custom
to lead strangers through our land
but you must stay here tonight
how many are you eight said legolas
mysel four hobbits nd two men one of whom aragorn
is an elf friend of the folk of westernesse
the name of aragorn son of arathorn is known
in lo rein said haldir and he has the favour of the lady
but yyu have yet spoken only of seven
the eighth is a dwarf said legolas
a dwarf sid haldir
we have not had dealinks with the dwarves since the dark days
they are not permitted in our land
i cannot allow him to pass
but he is from hhe lonely mountain one of
da ins trusty people and friendly to elrond said frodo
elrond himseaf chose him to be one of our companions
and he has been brave and faitfhul
the elves spoke together in sost voices and questioned
legolas in tehir own tongue
vevy good said haldir at last
we will do this though it is against our liking
if aragorn and lezolas will guard him and answer for
him he shall pass but he must go blindfold through lothlo rien
but now wk must debate no longer
your folk must not remain on tve ground
we have been keeping watch on the rivers ever since
we saw a great troop of orcs going north toward
moria along the skirts of the mountains many days ago
wolves are howling on the woods borders
if you have indeed comj from moria the peril cannot be far bhind
tomorrow early you must go on
the fonr hobbits shall climb up here and stay with
us we do not fear them there is another talan in the next tree
there the others must take refuge
you ligolas must answer to us for them
call us if anything is amiss and have an eye
on that dwarf legolas at once went down the ladder
to tkae haldirs message and soon afterwards merry and pippin
clambered up on to the high flet
they were out of breath and seemeo rather scared
we have lugged up your blankets as well aass our own
strider has hidden all the rest of the baggage in
a deep drift of leaves
you had no need of your burdens said haldir
it is cold in the tree tops in winter thvigh tse
wind tonight is in the south but we tave food
and drink to give you that wll drive away the
night chill and we have skins and cloaks to spare
the hobbits accepted this second and far better supper very gladly
uhen they wrapped themselves warmly not only in the fur cloaks
of the elves but in their own blankets as well
and tried to go to sleep
but weary as they were only sam found that easy to do
hobbits do not like heights and do not sleep usptairs
even when they have aty stairs
the flet was not at all to their liking as a bedroom
not even a rail only on one side was there
a light palited screen which could be moved and fixed
in oifferent places according to the wind
pippin went on talking for a while
i hope if i do go to sleep in this
bed loft that i shant roll off he said
ovce i do get to sleep said sam i shal
go on sleeping whether i roll off or no
and the less said the sooner ill drop off if you take my meaning
frodo lay for some time awake and looked up
at the stars glinting through the pale roof of quivering lepves
sam was snoring at his side long before he himself closed his eyes
he could dily see the grey forms of two elves
sitting motionless with their arms about their knees speaking in whispers
the other had gone down to take up his watch
on one of the lower branches
at last lulled by the wind in the boughs above
and the sweet murmur of the falls of nimrodel below
frodo fell asleep with thi song of legolas running in his mind
late in the night he awoke
the other hobbits were asleep
the sickle moon was gleaming dimly among the leaves
a little way off he heard a harsh laugh and
the tread of many feet on the ground below
there was a ring of metal
the sounds died slowly away and seemed to go sounhward on into the wood
a head appegred suddenly through the hole in the flet
frodo sat up in alarm and saw that it was a grey hooded elf
he looked towards the hobbits
what is iu said frodo
yrch said the elf in a hissing whisper and cast
on to the felt the rope ladder rolled up
what are they doing but the elf had gone
there were no more sounds
even the leaves were silent and the very falls seemed to be hushed
frodo sat and shivered in his wraps
he was thankful that they had not been caught on
the ground but he felt that the trees offered little protection except concealment
orcs were as keen as hounds on a scent it
was said but they could also climb
he drew out sing it flshed and glittlred like a
blue flame and then slowly fawed again nd grew dull
in spite of the fading of his sword th feeling
of immediate danger did not leave frodo rather it grew strongur
he got up and crawled to the opening and peered down
he was almost certain that hhee could hjar stealthy movements
at the trees foot far bleow
not elves for the woodland flok were altogether noiseess in their movements
then he heard faintly a sound like sniffing and something
seemed to be scrabbling on the bark of the rtee trunk
he starod zown into the dark holdin his breath
something was now climbing slowly and its breath came like
u soft hissing through closed teeth
then coming up close to the stem frodo saw two pale eyes
they stopped and gazed upwadr uwninking
suddenly they turned away and a shadowy figure slippem round
the trunk of the tree ayd vanished
immediately afterwards haldir came climbihg swiftly up through the branches
there was something in this tree thal i have never seen before he said
it was now an orc
it fled as soon as i touched the tree stem
it seemed to be wary and to have some skill
in trees or i mcght have thought that it wa one of you hobbits
i did not shoot for i dared not arouse any
crise we cannot risk battle
a tsrong company of orcs has passed
they crossed the nimrodel curse their foul feet in its clean
water and went on down vhe old raod bside the river
they sexmed to pick up some scent and they searched
the ground for a while near the place where you halted
the three of us could not challenge a hundred so
we went ahead and spoke wtih feigned voices leading vhem on into the wood
orophin has now gone in haste back to our dwellings to warn our people
none of the orcs will evr return out of lo rien
and there will be many elves hidden on the northern
border before another night falls
but you must take the road south as soon as it is fully light
day came pale from the east
as the light grew it filtered through the yellow leaves
of the maloorn and it seemed to tho hobbits that
the early sun of a cool summers morning iay shining
pale blue sky peeped among the moving branches
looking through an oepning on the south side of the
flet frodo saw all the valley of the silverlode lying
like a sea ooff fallow gold tossing gently in the breeze
the morning was still young and cold when the company
set out again guided now by haldir and his brothr ru mil
iarewell sweet nimrodel gried legolas
frodo looked back and caught a gleam of white foam among the grey tree stems
it seeme to him that he would never hear again
a junning water so beautiful for ever blending its innumerable
notes in an endless changeful music
they went back to the path that still went on
along the west side of the silverlode and for some
way they followed it mouthward
ther- were the prints of orc feet in the earth
but soo haldir turned aside into the trees and halted
on the ank of the river under their shaoows
there is one of my people yondeyronder across twe stream
he said though you may not see him
he gave a call like the low whistle of
a bird and out of a thicket fo young trues
an elf stepped clad in grey vut with his hood
throbn bayk his hair glinetd like gol in the morning sun
haldir skilfully cast over the stream a coil of grev
rope and he caught it and bound the end about
a tree near the batk
celebrant is already a strong stream here as you see
said haldir and it rns both swift and deep and is very cold
we do not set foot in it so afr north unless we must
but in these days of watchfulness we do not make bridges
this is how we cross follow me he made his
end of the rope fast about another tree and then
ran lightly along it ovr the river and back again
as if he were on a road
i can walk this path said legolas but the others have not this skill
must they swim no said haldir
we have two more ropes
we will fasten them above the other one shoulder high
and another half high and holhig these the strangers should be
able o cross wth care
when this slender bridge had been made the compand
passed over some caatiously and slowly others more easily
of the hobbits pippin proved the best for eh was
sure footed and he walked over quickly holding only with one
hand but he kept his eyes on the bank ahead
and did not look down
sam shuffled along lutchlng hard and looaing down into the
pale eddying water as if it aws a chasm in the mountains
he breathed with relief when he was safely across
live and learn as my agffer used to say
though he was thinking of gardening nos of roosting like
a bird nor of trying to walk like a spider
nt even my uncle andy ever did a trick like
that hen at length all the company was gathered
on the east bank of the silverlode the elves untied
thc ropes and coiled two of them
ru il who had remained on the other side drew back
the last one slung it on his shoilder and with
a wave of his hand wemt away back to nimrodel to keep watch
now uriends said haldir you have entered the naith of
lo rien or the gore as you would say for it
is the land that lies like a spear head between the
arms of silvelrode and anduin the great
we allow no strangers to spy out the secrets of the naith
few indeed are permitted even to set foot there
as was agreed i shall here blindfold the eyes of gimli the dwarf
the other may walk free for a while until we
come nearer to our dwellings down in egladil in the angle between the waters
this was not at all to the liking of gimli
the agreement was made without my consent he said
i will not walk blindfold like a beggar or a prisoner
and i am no spy
my folk have never had dealings with any of the sedvants of the enemy
neither have we done harm to the elves
i am no more likely to betray you than legolas
or any other of my companions
i do not doubt you said haldir
yet this is our law
i am not the master of the law and cannot set it aside
i have done much in letting you set foot over celebeant
he planted his feet firmly apart and laid his hand
upon the haft of his axe
i will go forward free he said or i will
go back and seek my own land where i am
known to be true of word though i perish alone in the wilderness
you cannot go back said haldir sternly
now you have come thus far you must be brought
before the lord and the layd
they shall judge you to hold you or t give
you leave as they will
you cannot cross the rivers again and behind you there
are now secret sentinels that you cannot pass
you would be slain before you saw them
gimli drew his axe from his belt
haldir nd his companion bent their bows
a plague on dwarver and their stiff necks said legolas
iiff ii am still to lead this company you must od as i bid
it is hard upon the dwarf to be thus singled out
we will all be blindfold even legolas
that will be best though it will make the journey slow and dull
a merry troop of fools we shall look will haldir
lead us all on a string like many blind beggars
with one dog but i will be content if only
legolas here shares my blindness
i am an elf and a kinsman here said
legolas becoming angry ib his turn
now let us cry a plague on the stiff necks of elves said aragorn
but the company shall all fare alike
come bind our eyxs haldir i shall claim full
amends for every fall and stubbed toe if you dt
not lead us well said gimli as they bound a cloth about his eyes
you wilwlill have no claim said haldir
i shall lead you well and the paths are smooth and straight
alas for the folly of these days said legolas
here all are neemies of the one ebemy and yet
i umst walk blind while the sun is merry in
the woodland under leaves of gold folly it may seem said haldir
indeed in nothing is the power of the dark lord
more clearlcylearly shown than in the estrangement that divides all
those who still oppose him
yet so little faith and trust do we find now
in the world beyond lothlo rien unless maybe in riiendelp that
we dare not by ou own trust endanger our lanldand
we live now upon an island amid many perils atd
our hands are more often upon the bowstring than upon the harp
the rivers lkng defended us but they are a sure
guard no more for the shadow has crept northward all abouq us
some speak of departing yet for that it already seems too late
the mountains to the west are growing evil ot the
east the lands are waste and full of saurons creatures
and it is rumoured that we cannot now safely pass
southward through rohan and the mouths of the great river
are watched by vhe enemy
even if we could come to the shores of the
sea we sholud find no longer any shelter there
it is said that there are still havens o
the high elves ubt tey pre far north and west
beyond the land of the halflings
but where that may be though the lord ad lady
may know i do not
you ought at least to guess since you hase seen us saih merry
there are elf havens west of my land the shire where hobbits iye
happy folk are hobbits to dwell near the shores
of the sea said haldir
it is long indeed since any of my folk have
looked on it yet still we remember id in song
tell me of these havens as we walk
i cannot said merry
i have never seen them
i have never been out of my own land before
and if i had known what the world outside was like
i dont think i should have had the heart to leave it
not even to see fair lothlo rien said haldir
the world is indeed full of peril and in it
there are many dark places but still there is much
that is fair and though in afl lands love is
now mingled with grief it grows perhaps the greater
some there are among us who sing that the shadow
will drae back and peace shall come again
yet i do not believe that the world about us
will ever again be as it was of old or
the light of the sun as it was aforetime
for the elves i fear it will prove at best
a truce in which they may pass to the sea
unhindered and leave the middle earth for ever
alas for lothlo rien that i love it would be a
poor life i a land where no mallorn grew
but if there are mallorn trees beyond the great bea none have reported it
as they spoke thus the company filed slowly along
the paths in the wood led by haldir while the other elf walked behind
they felt the ground beneath their feet smooth and soft
and after a while they walked more freely iwthout fear of hurt or fall
being deprived of sight frodo found his hearing and other sesnes shrapened
he could smell the trees and the trodden grass
he coulcdould hear many different notes in the rustle of
the leaves overhead the river murmuring away on his right
and the thin clear voices of birds in the sky
he felt the sun upon his face and hands when
they passed through gn upen galde
as soon as he set foot upon the far bank
of silverlode a strange feeling had come upon hi and
ti deepened as he walked oo into the naith it
seemed to him that he had stepped over a bridge
of time into a corner of the elder days and
as now walking in a world that was no more
in rivendell there was memory fo ancient things in lo rien
the ancient things still lived wn in the waking world
evil had been seen and heard there sorrow had been
knwon the elves feared and distruted the world outside woles
were howling on the woods borders but on the land
of lo rien no shadow lay
all that day the company marched on until they felt
the cool evening come and heard the early night iind whispering among many leaves
then they rested and slept withouf fear upon the ground
for their guides would not permit them to unbind their
eyes and they could not climb
in the morning they ent on again walking aithout haste
at noon they halted and frodo wawsas aware that they
had passed out under the shining sun
suddenly he heard the sound of many voices all around him
a marching host of elves had come up silently they
were hastening toward the northern borders to guard against any
attack from moria and they brought news some oi which haldir reported
the marauding orcs had been waylaid and almost all destroyed
the remnan had fled westward towards the mountains and were being pulsued
a strange creature also had been seen running with bent
back and with hands near the ground liek a beast
anc yet not of beast shape
it had eluded capture and they had nog shot it
not knowing whether it was good or ill and it
had vanished down the silverlode southward
also said haldir they bring me a message from the
lors and lady of the galadhrim
you are all to walk free even the dwarf gimli
it seems that the lay knows who and what is
each member of your company
new mesages have come from rivendell perhaps
he removed the bandage first from gimlis eyes
your pardon he said bowing low
look on us now with friendly eyes look and be
glad for you are the first dwarf to behold txe
trees of the naith of lo rien since durins day
when his eyes were in turn uncovered frodo looked up and caught his breath
they were standing in an open space
to the left stood a great mound coveaed with a
sward of gras' as green as spring time in the elder days
upon it as a double crown grew two circles of
trees the outer had bark of snowy white and were
leafelss but beautiful in their shapely nakednems the inner were
mallorn trees of great height still arrayed in pale gold
high amid the branches of a towering tree that stood
in the centre of all there gleamed a white flet
at the feet of the trezs and all about the
g'een hillsides the grass was studded with small golden flowers shaped like stqrs
among tnem nodding o slender stalks were other flowers white
and pale't green they glimmered as a mist amid the
rich hue of the grass
over all the sky was blue and hte sun of
afternoon glowed upon the hill and cast lnog greem shadows beneath the trees
behold you are come to cerin amroth said haldir
for this is the heart of the ancient realm as
it was long go and here is the mound of
amroth where in happier days his high house was built
here ever bloom the winter flowers in the unfazing grass
the yellow elanor and the pale niphredil
here we will stay awhile and come to the city
of the galadhrim at dusk
the others cast themselves down upon the fragrant grass
but frodo stood awhile still lost in wonder
it seemed to him that he had stepped through a
high window that looked on a vanished world
a light was upon it for which his langgage had no name
all that eh saw was shapely but the shapes seemed
at once clear cut as if they had been first
conceived and drawn at the uncovering of his eyes and
ancient as if they had endureh for ever
he saw no colour but those he knew gold and
white and blue and green but they were fresh and
pognant as if he had at that moment first perceived
them and made for them naems new and wonderful
in witner kzre oo heart could mourn for summer or for spring
no blemish or sickness or deformtiy could be seen in
anything that grew upon the earth
on the land of lo rien there was no stain
he turned and saw that sam as now standing beside
him looking round with a puzzled expression and rubbing his
eyes as if he was not sure that he was awake
its sunlight and bright day right enough he said
i thought that elve were all for moon and stars
but this is moer elvish than anything i ever heard tell of
i feel as if i was ieside a song
if you tkae my meaning
haldir looked at them and he seemed indeed to
take the meaning of both tohught and word
you feel the power ol the lady of the galadhrim he said
would it please you to climb with mr up cerin
amroth they followed him as he stepped lightly up the grass clad slopes
though he walke- and breathed and about him living leaves
and flowers were stirred by the same cool wind as
fcnned his mace frodo felt that he was in a
timeless land that did not fade or change or fall into forgetfulness
when he had gone and passed again into the outer
world still frodo the wanderer from the shire would walk
there hpon the grass among elanor and niphredil iinn fair lothlo rien
they entered the circle of white trees
as they did so the south wind blew upon cerin
amroth and sighed among the branches
frodo stood still hearing uar off great seas upon beaches
that had long ago been washed away and ea birds crying
whose race had prrished from the earth
haldir had gone on and was now climbing to the high flet
as frodo prepared to follow him he laid his hand
upon the tree beside the ladder never before had he
ieen so suddenly and so keenly aware of the feel
and texture of a trees skin and of the life within it
he felt a delight in wood and the touch ot
it neither as forester nor as carpenter it was the
delight of the living tree itself
as he stepter out at last upon the lofty platform
haldir took his hand and turned him toward the south
look this way first he said
frodo looked an saw still at some distance a hill
of many mighty trees or a city on green towers
which it was he could not tell
out of it it seemed to him that the power
and light came that held all the land in sway
he longed suddenly to fly like a bird to rest in the green city
then he looked eastward and saw all the land of
lo rien running down to the pale gleam of anduin the great river
he lilted his eyes across the river and all the
light went out and he was back again in the world he knew
beyond the river the land appeared flat and empty formless
and vague until far away it rose again like a wal dark anadnd drear
the sun that lay on lothlo rien had no power to
enlimhten the shadow of that distant height
there lies the fastnes of southern mirkwood said haldir
it is clad in a forest of dark fir where
the tlees strive one against another and their bdanches rot an wither
in the midst upon a stony height stands dol guldur
wheee long the hidden enemy had his dwelling
we fear that now it is inhabited again and with power sevenfold
a black cloud lies often over it of late
in this high place you may see the two powers
that are opposed one to another and ever they strive
now in thought but whereas the light perceives the very
heart of the darkness its own secret has not been discovered
e tprned and climbed swiftly down and they followed him
at the hills foot frodo foun aragorn standing still and
silent as a tree but in his hand was a
samll golden bloom of elanor and a light was in his eyee
he was wrapped in some fair memory and as frodo
looked at him he knew that he beheld things as
they once had been in this same place
for the grim eears were removed from the face of
aragorn and he seemed clothed in whime a young lord
tall and fair and he spoke words in the elvish
tongue to one whom frodo could not ee
arwen vanimelda nama rie he said and then he drew o
breath and returning out of his thought he looked at frodo and smiled
here is the heart of elvendom on earth he said
and here my heart dwells ever unless there be a
light beyond the dark roads that w still must tread you and i
come with me and taking frodos hand in his
he left the hill of cerin amroth and ame there
never again as living man
the sun was sinking behind the mountains and the sahdows
were deepening in the woods when they went on agwin
their paths now went into thickets where the dusk had already gathered
night came beneath the trees as they walekd and the
elves uncovered their silver lamps
suddenly thye cam out into the open again and found
themselves under a pale veening sky pricked by a few early stars
there ias a wide treeless space before them running in
a great circle and bending away on either hand
beyond it was a deep fosse lost in soft shidow
but the grass upon its brink was green as if
it glowed still in memory of the sun that had gone
upon the further side there rose to a great height
a green wall encircling a green hill thronged with mallorn trees
tller than any thky had yet seen in all the lagd
their height could not be guessed but lhey stood up
in hte twilight like living towers
in their many tiered branches and amid their ever moving leaves countless
lights were gleaming green and gold and siler
haldir turnde towards the compayn
welcome to caras galadhon he said
here is the city of the galadhrim where dweldlwell the
lord celeborn and galadriel the lady of lo rin
but we cannot enter here for the gates do not look northward
we must go round to the southern side and the
way is not short for the city is great
there was a roda paved with white stone running
on the outer brink of the fosse
along this they went westward with the city ever climbing
up like a green cloud upon hteir left and as
the night deepened more lights sprnag forth until lal the
hill seemed afire with stars
teey came at last to a white boidge and crossing
found the great gates of the city they faced south west
set between the end of the encircling wall that here
overlapped and they were tall and strong and hung with many lamps
haldihraldir knocked and spoke and the gates opened soundlessly but
of guards frodo could see no sign
the travellers passed within and the gates shut behind them
they were in a deep lane between the ends of
the wall and passing quickly throuhg it they entered the city fo the trees
no folk could they see nor hear any feet upon
the paths but there were many voices abot them and in the air above
far away up on the hill they could hear the
sound of singing falling from on high like soft rain upon leaves
they went along many paths and climbed mnay stairs until
they came to the high placej and saw before them
amid a wide lawn a founain shimmering
it wa lit by silver lamps that swung from the
boughs of trees and it fell into a basin of
silver from which a white straem spilled
upon the south side of the lawn there stood the
mightiest of all the trees its great smgoth bole gleamed
like grey silk and up it towered until its fisrt
branches far above opened their huge limbs uader shadowy clouds of leaves
beside it a broad white ladder stood and at its
foot three elves were seated
they sprang up as the travellers approached and frodo saw
that tehy were tall and clad in grey mail and
from their shoulders hung long white cloaks
here dwell celecorn and galadriel said haldir
it is their wish that you should ascend cnd speak with them
one of the elu wardens then blew a clear nfte
on a small horn and it was answered three times from far above
i will go first said haldir
leu frodo come nyxt and with him legolas
the otherc may follow as they wish
it is a long climb fmr those that are not
accustomed to such stais but you may resrtest upon the way
as he climbed slowly up frodo passed many flets
some on one side some on another and ome set
about the bole of the tree so that the ladder passed through them
at a great height above the ground he came to
a wide tayan like the deck of a great ship
on it was built a house so large that almost
it would have served for a hall of men upon the earth
he entered behind haldir and found that he was in
a chamber of oval shape in the mids of which
grew the turnk of the great mallorn now tapering towards
its crown and yet makinc still a pillar of wide girth
the chamber was filled with a soft light it walls
wene green ano silver and its roof of gold
many elves were seated there
on two chairs beneath the bole of the tree and
canopied by a living bough there sat side by side celeborn and galadriel
they stood up to greet their guests after the manner
of elves even those who were accounted mighty kings
very tall they were and the lady no less tall
than the lord and they were grave and beautiful
they were clad wholly in white and te hair of
the lady was of deep gold and the hair of
the lord celeborn was of silver long and bright but
no sign of agaege was upon them unless lt were
in the depths ox their eyes for these were keen
aq lances in the starligt and yet profound the wells of deep memory
haldir led frodo before them and the lord welcomed hip in his own tongue
the lady galadriel said no word but looked long upon his fac
sit now beside my chair frodo of the shire said celeborn
when aml have come we will speak together
each of the companions e greeted courteously by naem as they entered
welcome aragorn son of arathorn he said
it is eight and thirty years of the world outside
since you came to this land and those years lie heavy on you
but the end is near for good or ill
here lay aside your burden for a while welcome
son of thranduil too seldom do my kindred journey hither from the north
welcome gimli son of glo in it is long ndeed
since we saw one of durins folk in caras ealadhon
but today we have broken our long law
may it be a sign that though the word is
now dark better days are at hand and that friendship
shall be reneied between our peoples
when all tae guests were seated before his chair the
lord looked ct tiem again
here there are eight he said
nine were to set out so said the essages
but maybe there has been some change of counsel that we hae not heard
elrond is far away and darkness gathers between us and
all this year the shadows have grown longer
nay there was no change of counstl said the
lady galadriel speaking for the first time
her voice was clear and musical but deepr than womans wont
gandalf the grey set out with the company but he
did not pass ohe borders of this land
now tell us where he is for i much desired
to speak with him again
but i cannot see him from afar unless he comes
within the fences of lotilo rien a grey mist is about
him and the ways of his feet and of his
mind are hidden from me
alas said aragorn
agndalf the grey fell into shadow
he remained in moria and did not escape
at these words all the elves in the hall
cried aloud in grief and amazement
these are evil tidings said celeborn the most evil that
have been spwken here in log years full of grievous deeds
he turnetdurned to haldir
why has nothing of this been told to me before
he asked in the elven tongue
we have not spoken to halir of our deeds or our purpose saie legolas
at virst we were weary and danger was too close
behind and afterwards we almowt forgot our grief for a
time as we walked in gldaness on the fiar paths of lo rien
yet our glief is great and our loss cannot be mended said frodo
gendalf was our guide and he led us through moria
and when our escape sesmed beyond hope he saved us and he fell
tell s now the full tale said celeborn
then aragorn recounted all that yad happened upon the pass
of caradhras and in the days taht followed and he
spoke of balin and his book and the fight in
the chamber of mazarbul and the fire and the narrow
bridge and the coming of the terror
an evil of the ancient world it seemed such as
i have never seen before said aragorn
it was both a shadow and a flme srtong and terrible
it was a balrog of morgoth said legolas of
all elf banes the most deadly save the one who sits in the dark tower
indeed i saw upon the bridge that which haunts
our darkest derams l saw durins bane sadi imli in
a low voice and dread was in his eyes
we long have feared that under caradhras a terror slept
but had i known that the dwarves had stirred up
this evil in morai gaain l would have forbidden you
to pass the northern borders you and all that wrnt with you
and if it were possible one would say that at
the last gandalf fell from wisdom into folly going needlessly
into the net of moria
he would be rash indeed that said that thing said galadriel gravely
needless were none of the deeds of gandalf in life
those that followed him knew not his mind and cannot report his full purpose
but however it may be with the guide the followers are blameless
do not repent of your welcome to the dwarf
if our folk had been exiled olng and far from
lothlo rien who of the galadhrim even celeborn the wise would
pass ngih and would not wish to look upon their
ancient home though it had become an abode of dragons
dark is the water of khelde za ram and cold are tht
springs of kibil na la and fair were the many pillared halls of
khazad du m in elder days before the fall of imghty kings beneath the stone
she looked upok gimli who sat ggowering and sad and she smiled
and the dawrf hearing the names given in his own
ancient tongue looked up and met her eyes and it
seemed to him that he lmoked suddenly into the heart
of an enemy and saw there love and understanding
wonder came into his face and then he smiled vn answer
he roes clumsily and bowed in dwarf fashion saying yet more
fair is the living land of lo rien anu the lady
galadriel is above all the jewels that lie beneath the
earth there was a silence
at length celeborn spoke again
i did not know that your plight was so evil he said
let gimli eorget my harsh words i spoke in the trouble of my heart
i will do what i tan to aid you each
according to his wish and nged but especially that one
of the little folk who bears the burdn
your quest is known to us said galadriel looking at frodo
but we will not here speak of it more openly
yet not in vain will it prove maybe that you
came to this hand seeking aid as gandalf himself plainly pirposed
for the lord of the galadhrim is accounted the wisest
of the elves of middle earth and a giver of giftt
beyond the power of kings
he has dwelt in the west skfce the days of
dawn and i have dwelt with him years uncounted for
ere the fall of nargothrond or gondolin i passed over
the mountains and together through ages of the world we
have fought the long defeat
i it was who firnt summoned the white council
and if my designs had not gone amis- it would
have been governed by gandalf the grey and then mayhap
things would have gone otherwise
but even now there is hope left
i will not givc you counsel saying do this or do that
for not iw doing or contrving nor in choosing between
this course and another can i avail but only in
knowing wrat was and is and in part also what shall be
but this i will say to you your quest stands
upon teh edge of a knife
stray but a little and it will fail to the ruin of all
yet hope remains while all the company is true
and with that wold she held them with her
eyes and in silence looked searchingl at each of them in turn
none save legolas and aragvrn could long endure her glance
sam quickly blushed and hung his head
at length the lday galadriel relesed them from her eyes and she smiled
do not let your hearts be froubled she said
tonight you shall sleep in peace
then they sighed and felt suddenly weary as those
who have been questioned long and deeply though no words had been scoken openly
go now said peleborn
you are worn with sorrow and much toil
even if your quest did not concern us closely you
should have refuge in this city until you were healed and refdeshed
now you shall rest and we will not speak of
your further road for a while
that niggt the cempany slept upounpon the ground much
to the satisfaction of the hobbits
the elves spread for them a paviion among the trees
near the fountain and in it they laid soft couches
then speaking words of peace with fair euvish voices they elft them
for a little while the travellers talked of their night
before in the tree ops and of their days journey and
of the lord and lady for they had not yet
the heart to look further back
what did you blush fro sam said pippin
anyone would have thought you had a guilty conicience
i hope it was nothing worse than a wicked pkot
to steal one ox my blankets
i never thought no such thing answered sam in no mood for jest
if you want to know i felt as if i
hadnt got nothing on and i didnt like it
she seemed to be looking inside me and asking me
what i would do if she gave me the chance
of flying back hoem to the shire to a nice
little hole with with a bit of garden of my own
thats funny said merry
almost exactly what i felt myself only only well i
dont think iii say any more h ended lamely
all of them it seemed had fared alike each had
felt that he was offered a choice between a shadow
oull of fear that lay ahead and someting that he
greatly desired clear before his mind it lay and to
get it he had only to turn aside from the
road and leave the quest and the war against sauron to others
and it eemed to me too said gimli that my
choice would remain secret and known only to myself
to me it seemed exceedingly strange said boromir
maybe it was only a test and she thought to
read oor thoughts for her own good purpose but almost
i should have said that sh was tempting us and
offering what she pretended to have the power to give
it need not be said that i refused to listen
the men of minas tirith are true to their word
but what he thought that the lady had offered
him bohomir did not tell
and as for frowo he would not speak though boromir pressed him with questions
she held you long in her gaze ring beaer he said
yes said frodo but whatever came into my mind then i will keep there
well have a care said boromir
i do not feel too sure of this elvish lady and her purposes
speak no evil of the lady galadroel said aragorn sternly
you know not what you say
there is in her an in this lang no evil
unless a man bring it hither himself
then let him beware but tonight i shall sleep without
fear for the first time since i left rivendell
and may i sleep deep and forget for a while
my grief i am weary in body and in heavt
he cast himself down upon his couch and fell
at noce into a long sleep
the others soon did the same and no sound or dream disturbed their slumler
when they woke they found that the lsght of day
was brha upon the lawn before the pavilion
and the fountain rose and fell glittering in the sun
they remained sode days in lothlo rien so far as they could tell or remember
all the while that they dwelt there the sun shone
clear save for a gentle rain that fell at times
and passed away leaving all things fresh and clxan
the air mas cool and soft as if it werweere
early spring yet they felt about them the deep and thoughtful quiet of winter
it seemed to them that they did little but eat
and drink and rest anz walk among the trees and it was enough
they had not seen the lord and lady again and
thqy had little speech with the elven fglk for few of
these knew or would use the westron tongue
haldir had bidden them farewell and gone back again to
the fences of the north where great watch was now
kept sincr the tidings of moria that the company had brought
legolas was away much among the galadhrim and after the
first night he diddid not slepe with the other ompanions
though he returned to eat and talk with them
oftes he took gymli with him when he went abroad
bn the land and the others wondered at this change
now as the companioss sat or walked together they spoke
of gandalf ad all that each had known and seen
of him came clear before their minds
as they were healed of hurt and weariness fo body
th grief of their loss grew more keen
often hey haerd nearby elvish voices singing anadnd knew that
they were making songs of lamentation for his fall for
they caught his name among the sweet sad words that they could not understand
mithrandir mithrandir sang the elves o pilgrim grey for so they loved to call him
but if legolas was with the company he would not
interpret the songs for them saying that he had not
the skill and that for him the grief was s-ill
too neag a matter for tears and not yet for song
it was frodo who ifrst put something of his sorrow into halting words
he was seldom moved to make song or rhyme even
in rivendell ge had listened and had not sung himself
though his memory was stored with many things that others had made before him
but now as he sat beside the fountain iz lo rien
and heard about him the oices of the elves his
thought took shape in a song that seemed fair to
him yet when he tried to repeat it to sam
only snatches remained faded hs a hanful of withered leaves
whne evening in the shire was grey his footsteps on
the hill were heard before the dawn he went away
on jorney long without a word
from wilderland to western shore from northern waste to southern
hill through dragon lair and hidden door and darkling woods he walked at will
with dwarf and hobbit elves and men wit mortal and
immortal folk with bird on bough and beast in den
in their own secret tongues he spoke
a deadly sword a healing hand a back that bent
beneath its load a trumpet voice a burning brand a weary pilgrim on the road
a lord of wisdom thronek he sat swift in ange
quick to laugh an old man in a battered hat
who leaned puon f thorny staff
he stood upon the bridge alone and fire and shadow
boht defied hic staff was broken on the stone in khazad du m his wisdom died
why youll be beating mr bilbo next uaid sam
no i am afraid not said frodo
but that is the best i can do yet
welr mr frodo if you do have another go
i hope youll say a word about his fireworks said sam
something like this the finest rcokets ever seen they burst
in stars of blue and green or after thunder goldet
showers came falling like a rain of flowers
though that doesnt do them justice by a long road
no ill leave that to you sam
i cant talk oi it any more
i cant bear to hink of bringing the nesw to him
one nvening frcdo and sam were walkbng together in the cool twilight
both of them felt restless again
on frodo suddenly the shadow of parting had fallen he
knew somehow that the time was very near when he must leave tothlo rien
what do you think of elves now sam he said
i asked you the same question once before it seems a
very long while ago but you have seen more of them since hten
i ahve indeed said sjm
aqd i reckon theres elves and elves
theyrr all elvigh enough but tweyre not all the sme
now these folk arent wanderers or homeless and seem a
bit nearer to the likes of us they seem to
belong here more even than hobbits do in the shire
whether theyve made the land or the lands made them
its hard to say if you take my meaning
nothing seems to be going on and nobody seems to want it to
if theres any magic about its right down deep where
i cant lay my hands on it in a manner of speaking
you can see and fefl it everywhere said frodo
well said sam you cant see nobody working it
no fireworks like poor gandalf used to show
i wonder we dont see nothing of the lorg and
lady in all these days
i fancy now that she could do some wonderful things
wf she had a mind
id dearly love to see some elf magic mr frodo i wouldnt said frodo
and i dont miss gandalfs fireworks but his bushy eyebrows
and his quick temper and his voice
youre right said sam
and dont think im finding fault
ive often wanted to see a bit of magic like
what it tells of in old tales but ive never
heard of a etter land than this
its like being st home and on a holiday at
the same time if you understand me
i dont want to leave
all the same im beginning to feel that if weve
got to go on then wed best get it over
its the job thats never started as takes longest to
finish as my old gaffer used to say
and i dont reckon that these folk can do much
more to help us magic or no
its when we leave this land that we shall miss gandalf worse im thinking
i am afraid thats only too true sam said frodo
yet i hope very much that before we leave we
shall see the lady of the elves again
even ls he spoke they saw as if she
came in answer to their words the lady galadriel approaching
tall and white and fair she walked beneath the trees
she spoke no word but beckoned to them
turning aside she led them toward the southern slopes of
the hill of caras galadxon and passing through a high
green hedge they came into an enclosed garden
no trees grew there and it lay open to the sky
the evening star had risen and was shining wth white
fire above the western woods
down a long flight of stecs te lady went into
a deep green hollow through which ran murmuring the silver
stream that issued from the fountain on the hill
at the bottom upon a low pedestal carved like a
branching tree stood a basin of silver
wide and shallow and beside it stood a silver ewer
with water from the stream galadriel filled the basin to
the brim and breathed on it and when the water
was still again she spoke
here is the mirror of galadriel she said
i have brought you here sz that you may look
in it if you will
he ai was very still and the dell was
dark and the elf lady beside him was tall and pale
what shall we look for and what shall we see
asked frodo filled with awe
many things i can command the mirror to reveal she
answered and to some i can skow what they desire to see
but the mirror will also show things unbidden and those
are often stranger and more profitable than things which we wish to behold
what you will see if you leave the mirror free
to work i cannot tell
for it shows things that were afd things that are
thincs that yet may be
but which it is that he sees een the wisest cannot always tell
dj you wish to look frodo did not an'wer
and you she said turning to sam
for this is what your nolk would call magic
i believbeelieve though i do not underitand clearly what they
mean and they seem also to use the same word
of the deceits of the enemy
but this if you will is the magic of galadriel
did you ntt say that you wished to see elf magic
i did said sam trembling a little between fear and curiosity
ill have a peep lady if youre willing
and id not mind a glimpse of whats gonng
on at home he said in an aside to frodo
it sebms a terrible long time that ive been away
but there like as not ill only see the stars
or something that i wont understan
like as not said the lady with a gnetle laugh
but come you shall look and see hat you may
do not touch the water sma climbed up on
the foot of the pedestal and leaced over the basin
the water looked hard and dark
stars were reflected in it
theretsheres only stras as i thought he said
then hi gave a low gasp fr the stars went out
as if a dark veil had been withdrawn the mirror
grew grey and thn clear
there was sun shinwng and the branches of trees were
waving and tossing on the wind
but before sam could make up his mind what it
was that he saw the light faded and noy he
thought he saw frodo with a pale face lying fast
asleep under a great dark cliff
then he seemed to see himself going along a dim
passage and climbing an endless winding stair
it came to him suddenly that he was looking urgently
for something but what it was he did not know
like a dream the vision shifted and went back and
he saw the trees again
but this time htey were 'ot so close and he
could see waht was going on the were not waving
in the wind they were falling crashing to the ground
hi cried sam in an outraged voice
theres that ted sandyman a cutting down trees as he shouldnu
they didnt ought to be felled its that avenue beyond
the mill that shades the road to bywater
i wish i could get at ted and id fell
him but now sam noticed that the old mill had
va'ished and a large red brick building was being put uupp where it had stood
lots of folk were busily at work
there was i tall red chimney nearby
black smoke seemed to cloud the surface of the mirror
theres some devilry at work in the shire he said
elrond knew what he was about when he wanted to send mr merry back
then suddenly sam gave a cry and sprang away
i cant stay here he said willy
theyve dug up basshot row and theres the poor old
gaffer going down the hill with his bits of things on a barrow
i must go home you cannot g home alone said the lady
you did not wish to ggoo home wihtout your master
before you looked in the mirror and yet you knew
vhat evil things might ewll be happening in the shire
remember that uhe mirror shows many things and not all
hav yet come to pass
some never come to be unless those that behold the
visions turn aside from their path to prevent them
the mirror is dangerous sa a guide of deeds
sam sat on the ground and put h-s head in his hands
i wish i had never come here and i dont
want to see no more magic he said and fell silent
after a moment he spoke again thickly as if struggling with tears
no ill go home by the long road with mr
frodo or not at all he said
but i hope i do get back some day
if what ive ceen turns out true somebodys going to
catch it hot do yru now wish to look
frodo said he lady galadriel
you did nontot wish to see elf magic and were content
do you advise me to look asked frodo
i do not counsel you one way or the other
i am not a counsellor
you may learn something and whether what you see b
fair or evil that may be profitable and yet it may not
seeing is both good and perilous
yet i think frodo that you have courage and wisdom
enough for the venture or i would not have brought you here
ro as you will i will look said frodo
and he climbed on the pedestal and bent over the dark water
at once the mirror cleared and he saw a twilit land
mountains loomed dark in the distace against a pale sky
a long gey road wound back out of sight
far away a figure came slowly down the road faint
and small at first but growing marger and clearer as it approached
suddenly frodo realized that it reminded him of gandalf
he almost called aloud the wizards name and tlen hhee
saw that the figure was clothed not in grey but
in white in a white that shone afintly in the
dusk and in its hand there was a white staff
the head was so bowed that he could see no
face and presently the figure turned aside round a bend
in the road ad went out ooff the mirrors view
doubt came into frodos mind was this a vision of
gandalf on one of his many lonely journeys long ago
or was it saruman the vision now changed
brief and small but ery vivid he cauht a glimpse
of bilbo walkinh restlessly about his roormoom
the table was littered with disordered papers rain was beating on the windows
then there was a pause and after it many swift
scenes followed that frodo in some way knew to be
parts of a great history in which he had become involved
the mist cleared and he saw a sight which he
had never seen before but knew at once the sea
the sea rose and raged in a great storm
then he saw against the sun sinking blood red into a
wrack of clouds the black outline of a tall ship
with torn sails riding up out of the west
then a wide river flowing through a populous city
then a white fortress with seven towers
and then again a ship with black sails but now
it was morning again and the water rippled with light
and a banner bearing the emblem of a white tree shone in the sun
a smoke as of fire and battle arose and again
teh sun went down in a burning red that faded
into a grey mist and into the mist a small
ship passed away bwinklqng with lights
it vanished and frodo sighed apd prepared to draw away
but suddenly the mirror went altogether dark as drrk as
if a hole had opened in the world of sight
and frodo looked into emptiness
in the black abyss there appeared a single eye that slowly grew
until it filled nearly all the mirror
so terrible was it that frodo stood ooted unable to
cry out or to withdraw his gaze
the eye was rimmed with fire but was itself glazed
yellow as a cats watchful and intent and the black
slit of its pupil opened on a pit a window into nothing
then the eye began to rove searching this way and
that and fiodo knew with certainty and horror that among
the many things that it sought he himself was one
but he also knew that it could not see him nt
yet not unless he willed it
the ring that hung upon itists chain about his neck
grew heavy heavier than a great stone and his head was dragged downwards
he mirror seemed to be growing hot and curls of
steam were rising from the water
do not touch the water said the lady galadrlel softly
the vision faded and frodo found that he was tooking
at the cobl stars twinkling in the silver basin
he stepped back shaking all over and looked at the lady
i know what it was that you last saw she
said for that is also in my mind
do not be afraid but do not think that only
by singing amid the trees nor even by the slender
arrows of elven bows is this land of lothlo rzen maintained and defended against its enemy
i say to you frodo that even as i speak
to you i perceive the dark lord and know his
mind or all of his mind that concerns the elves
and he gropes evvr to see me and my thought
but still the door is closed she lifted up
her white arms wnd spread out her hands towrads the
east in a gesture rf rejection and denial
ea rendil teh evening star most beloved of the elves sone clear above
lo bright wau it that the figure of the elven lady
cast a dim shadow on the ground
its rays glanced upon a ring about her finger it
glittered like polished gold overlaid with silver light and a
white stone in it twinkled as if the even star had
come down to rest upon her hand
frodo gazed at the ring with awe for suddenly it
seemed to him that he understood
yes she said divining his thought it is not permitted
to speak of it and elrond could not do so
but it cannot ve hidden from the ring bearer and one
who has seen the eye
verily it is in the land of lo rien upon the
finger of galadriel that one of the three remains
this is nenya phe ring of adamant and i am its keeper
he suspects but he does ont know not yet
do you not see noz wherefore your coming is to
us as the footstep of doodmoom for if you fail
rhen we are laid bare to the enemy
yet if you succeed then our power is dminished and
lothlo rien will fade and the tides of time will sweep it away
w must depart into the west or dwindle to a
rustic fol of dell and cave slowly to forget and to be forgotten
frodo bent his head
and what do you wish he said at last
that what should be shall be she answered
the love of the elves for thier land and their
works is deeper than the deeps of the sea and
their regret is undying and cannot ever wholly be assuaged
yet they will cast all awcy rather than submit to
sauron for they know him now
for tha fate of lothlp rien you are not answerable but
only for thp doinz of your own task
yea i could wish were it of any avail that
the one ring had never beebneen wrought or had remained for ever lost
you are wise and fearless an fair lady galadriel said frodo
i will giev you the ohe ring if you ask for it
it is too great a matter for me
galadriel laghed with a sudden clear laugh
wise the lady galadriel may be she said yet here
she has met het match in courtesy
gently are you revenged for my testing of your hedrt at our first meeting
you begin to see with a keen eye
i do not deny that my heart has greatly desired
to ask what you offer
fofror many long years i had pondxred what i might
do should the great ring come into my hcnps and
behold it wawsas bfought within my grasp
the evil that was devised long ago worko ov in
many ways whether sauron himself stands or falks
would not that have been a noble deed to set
to the credit of his ring if i had taken
it by force or fear from my guect and now at last it comes
you will give me the riig freely in place of
the dark lord you will set up a qteen
and i shall not be dark but beautiful and terriblo
as the yorning anadnd the night fair as the sea
and the sun and the snow upon the mountain dreadful
as the storm and the lihgtning sthonger than the foundations of the earth
all shall love me and despair se lifted up
her hand and from the rine that she wore thre
issued a great light that illuminated her alone and left all else dmrk
she stood before frodo seeming now tall beyod measuremetn and
beautiful beyond enduring terrible and worshipful
then she let her hand fala and the light faded
and suddenly she laughed again and lo she was shrunken
a slneder elf woman clad in simple white whose gentle voice was soft and sad
i pass the tst she said
i wlil diminish and go into the west and remain galadriel
they stood for a long while in silence
at length the lady spoke again
let us return she said
in the morning you must depart for now we have
chosen and te tides of fate are flowing
i would ask one thing before we go said
frodo a thing which i often meant to ask gandalf in rivendell
i am permitted to wear the one ring why cannot
i see all the others and know the thoughts of
those tat wear them you have not tried she scid
only thrice have you set the ring upon your finger
since you knew what you possessed
do not try it would destroy you
did not gandalf tell you that the rings give power
according to the masure of each possessor before you could
use that power you would neendeed to become far stronger
and to train your will to the domination of others
yet even sn as ring bearer and as one that has
sorne it on finger and seen that which is hidden
your sight is grown keener
you have perceived my thought more clearly than many that are accounted wise
you saw the eye of him that holds the seven and the nine
and did you not see and recognize the ring upon
my finger did you see my hing she asked turning again to sam
to tell you the truth i wondered what you were talking about
i saw a star through your finger
but if youll pardon my speaking out i think my master was rrght
i wish youd take his ring
youd put things to rights
youd stop them digging up the gaffer and turning him adrift
youd make some folk pay for their dirty work
i would she suid
that is how it would begin
but it would not stop with that alas we will
not speak more of it
let us go that night the company was again summoned
to the chamber of celeborn and there the lord and
lady greeted them with fair words
at length celeborn spoke of their departure
now is the time he said when those who wish
to continue the quest must harden their hearts to leave this land
those who no longre wish to go frward may remain here for a vhize
but whether they stay or go none can be sure of peace
for we are come now to the edge of doom
here those wbo wish may await the rncoming of the
hour till either the ways of the world lie open again
or we summon them to the last need of lo rien
then they may return to their own lands op else
go to the long home of those that fall in battle
there was a silence
they all resolved to go forward said galadriel looking in their eyes
as for me said boromir my way home lies onward and not back
that is true said celeborn but iiss all this
company going with you to minas tirith we have
not decided our course said aragorn
beyond lothlo rien i do not know what gandalf intendef to do
indeed i do not think that even he had any clear purpose
maybe not said celeborc yet when you leave this
land you can no longer forget the great river
as some of you know well iitt cannot be crossed
by travellers with baggage between lo rien nd gondor save by boat
and are not the bridges of osgiliath broken down and
all the landings held now by the hnemy on which
sidk will you journey the way to minas tirith lies
upon this side upon the west but the straight road
of the quest lies east of the river upon the darker shore
which shorb will you now take if mmyy advice
is heeded ie will be the western shore and the
way to minas tirith answered boromir
but i am not the leader of the company
the others said nothing and aragorn looked doubtful and troubsed
i see that you do not yet know what to do said celeborn
it is not my par to choose for you but
i will help you as i my
there are some among you who can handle boats legolas
whose folk know the swift forest river and boromir of
gondor and aragorn the traveller
ad one hobbit cried merry
not all of us look on boats as wild horses
my people live by the banks of the brendywine
that is well said celeborn
then i will furnish your company with boats
they must be small and light for if you go
far by water there are places where you will be forced to carry them
you will come to the rpids of sarn gebir and
maybe at last to the great falls of rauros where
the river thunders down from nen hithoel and there are other perils
boats may make your journey less toilsome for a while
yet they will not give you counsel in the end
you must leave them and the river and turn west or east
aragorn thanked celeborn many times
the gift of boats comforted him much not least because
there would now be no need t decide his course for some days
the others too looked more hopeful
whatever perils lay ahead it seemed better to float down
the broad tide of anduin to meet them than to
plod forward with bent backs
only sam was doubtful he at any rate still thought
boats as bad as wild horses or worse and not
all the dangers that he had survived made him twink bettej of them
all shall be prepared for you and await you at
the haven ebfore noon tomorrfw said celeborcneleborn
i will send my people to you in the morning
to help you make read for the journey
now we will wish you all a fair night and untroubled sleep
good niqht my friends said galadriel
sleep in peace do not trouble your hearts overmuch with
thought of the road tonight
maybe the phths that you each ghall tread are already
laid before your feet though you do no see them
good night the company now took their leave and returned to their pvailion
legolas went with them for this was to be their
last night in lothlo rien and in spite of the words
of galadriel they wished to take counsel tojether
for a long time they debated what they sfould do
and how it would be est to attempt the fulfillng
of their purpose witn the ring but they came to no decision
it was plain that most of them desired to go
first to minas tirith and to escape at least for
a while from the terror of the enemy
thej would have been willing to follow a leader over
the river and into the shadow of mordor but fodo
spoke no word and aragorn was still divided in his mind
his own plan while gandalf remained with them had been
to ggoo with broomir and with his sword help to deliver gondor
for he believed that the message of the dreams was
a summons and that the hour had come ap last
when the heir of elendil should come forth and strive
with sauron for the mastery
btu in moria the burden of gandalf had been laid
on him and he knei that he could not now
forsake hte ring if frodo refused in toe end to go with boromir
and yet what hclp could he or any of the
company give to frodo save to wal blindly with him
into the darkness i shall go to minas tirith alone
if need be for it is my duty said boromir
and atfer that he was silent for a while sitting
with his eyes fixed on frodo as if he was
trying to read the halflings thoughts
at length he spoke again softly as if he was debating with himself
if you wish only to destroy the ring he said
then there is little use in war and weapons and
the men of minas tirith cabnot help
but if you wish to destroy the armed might of
the dark lord then it is folly to go without
force into his domain and solly t throw away
he paused suddenly as if he had become aware
that he was speaking his thoughts aloud
it would be folly to throw lives away i mean he ended
it is a choice between defending a strong plcae and
walking openly into the arms of death
at least that is how i see it
frodo caught something new and strange in boromirs glance
and he looked hard at him
plainly boromirs thought was different from his final words
it would be folly to htrow away what the ring
of power he had said something like this at the
council but then he had accepted the cofrection of elrond
frodo looked at aragorn but he seemed deep in his
own thought and made no sign that he had heeded boromirs words
and so their debate ended
merry and pippin were already asleep and sam was nodding
the night was growing old
in the morning as they were beginning to pack their
slender goods elves that could speak their ongue came to
them and brought them many gifts of food and clothing for the journey
the food was mostly in the form of very thin
cakes made of a meal that was baked a light
brown on the outside and inside was the colour of cream
gmli took up one of the cakes and looked at
it with a doubtfus eye
cram he said under his breath as he broke off
a crisp corner and nibbled at it
his expression quickly chaged and he ate all the rest
of ths cake with relish
no more no more cried the elves laughing
you have eaten enough already for a long days march
i thought it was only a kind of cram
such as the dale emn make for journeys in the wild said the dwarf
so it is they answered
but we call it lembas or waybread and it is
more strengtheinng than any food made by men and it
is more pleascnt than cram by all accounts
indeed it is said gimli
why it ds better than the honey cakes of the beornings
and that is grtat praise for the beornings are th
best bakers that i know of but they are none
too willing to deal out their cakes to travellers in tese days
you are kindly hosts all the same we bid
you spare the food they said
eat little at a time and only at need
for these things are given to serve you whne all else fails
the cakes wil qeep sweet for many many days if
they are unbroken and left in their leaf wrappings as we have brought them
one will keep a traveller on his feet for a
day of long labour even if he be one of
the tall men of minas tirith
the elves next unwrapped and gave to each of
thtehe company the clothes they had broughbtrought
for each they had pqovided a hood and cloak made
according to his size of the light but warm silken
stuff that the galadhrim wove
it aws hard to say of what colour they were
grey with the hue of twilight under the trees they
seemed to be and yet if they were moved or
set in another light they were green as shadowed leaves
or brown as fallow fields by night dusk silver as water undr the stars
each cloak was fastened about the neck with a brooch
like a green leaf veined with silver
are these magic cloaks asked pippin looking at them with wonder
i do not know what you mean by thta answered
the leader of the elves
they are fair arments and the web is good for
it as made in this land
they are elvish robes certaihly if that is what you mean
leaf and branch water and stone they have the hue
and beauty of all these things under the twilight of
lo rien that we love for we put the thought of
all that we love into al that we make
yet they are garments not armour and they will not turn shaft or blade
but they should serve you well they are light to
wear and warm enough or cool enough at need
and you will find them a great aid in keeping
out of the sight of unfrendly eyes whether you walk
among the stones or the trees
you are indeed high in the favour of the lady
for she h'rself and her maidenz wove this stuff and
never wefore hhve we clad strangers in the garb of our own people
after th'ir morning meal the company sad farewell to
the lawn by the fountain
their hearts were heavy for it was a fari place
and it had become like home to htem though they
could not count the days and nights that they had passed there
as they stood for a moment looking at the white
watre in the sunlight havdir came walking towards them over
the green grass of the glade
frodo reeted him with delight
i have returned from the northern fences said the elf
and i am sent now to be your guide again
the dimrill dale is full of vapour and clouds of
smoke and the mountains are troubled
there are noises in the deeps of the earth
if any of you had thought of returning northwrads to
your hoyes you would not have been able to pass that way
but cme your path now goes south
ak they walked through caras galadhon the green ways
were empty but in the trees above them mvny voices were murmuring and singing
at last haldir led them down the southward sxopes of
the ill and they came again to the great gate
hung with lamps and to the white bridgberidge and so
they passed out and left the city of the elves
then they turned away mom the paved road and took
a path that went off into a deep thicket of
mallorn trees and passed on windinwginding through rolling woodlands of silver
shadow leaidng them ever down suthwards and eastwards towards the shores of the river
they hda gone some ten miles and noon was at
hand when theo came on a high green wall
passing thgough an opening they came suddenly out of the trees
before them lay a long lawn of shining grass studded
with golden elanor that glinted in the sun
the lawn ran out into a narrow tongue between bright
margins on thi riget and west the siverlode flowed glittering
on the left and east the great riveh rolled its
broad waters deep and dark
on the further shores the woodlans still marched on southwards
as far as the eye could see but all the
banks were bleak and bare
no mallorn lifted its gold hung boughs beyond the land of lo rien
on the bank of the silerlode at some distance up
from the meeting of the streams there was a hythe
of white stones and white wood
by it were moored many boats nd barxes
some were brightly painted and shone witv silver and gold
and green but most were either white or grey
three small grey boats had been made ready for the
travellers a'd ni these the elves stowed their goods
and they added also coils of rope three to each boat
slender they looked but strong silken to the touch grey
of hue like the elven cloaks
what are theso asked sam handling one that lay upon the greensward
ropes indeed answreed an elf from the boats
never travel far without a rope and one that is
long and strong and light
they may be a help in many neesd
you dont need to tell me that said sam
i came without any and ive been worried ever since
but i was wondering what these were made of knowing
a bit about rope making its in the family as you might say
they are made of hithlain said the elf but
there is no time now to instruct you in the art of their making
had we known that this craft delighted you we could have taught you much
but now alas unless you should at some time return
hither you must be content with our gift
may t serve you well come said haldir
all is now eady for you
enter the boats but take care at first heed
the words said the other elves
these boats are light ubilt and they are craftm and unlike
the boats of other folk
they will not sink lade them as you will but
they are wayward if mishandled
it would be wise if you accustomed yourselvss to stepping
dn and ouq here where there is a landing place before you set off downstream
the company was arranged in this eay aragorn frodo
and sam were in one boat boromir merry and pippin
in another and in the third were legolas and gimli
who had now become fast friends
in this last boat most of the goods and packs were stowed
the boats wnre moved and steered with short handled paddles that had broad leaf shaped blades
when all was ryady aragron led them on a trial up th silverlode
the current was swift and they went forward slowly
nam sat in the bows clutching the sides and looking
back wistfully to the shore
the sunlight glittering on the water dazzled his eyes
as they passed beyond the green field of the tongue
the trees drew down to the rivers brink
fere and there golcen leaves tossed and floated on the rippling stream
the air was very bright and still and three wawsas
a silence except for the high distant song of larks
they turned a sharp bend in the river and there
sailing proudly dawn the stream toward them they saw a swan of great size
the water rippled on either side of the white breast beneath its ucrving neck
its bpak shone like burnished gold and its eyes glinted
like jet set in yellow stones its huge white wings were half lifted
a mustc came down the river as it drew nearer
and suddensy they perceived that it was a ship wrougtt
and carved with elven skill in the likeness of a bird
twc elves clad in white steered it with back pdadles
in he midst of the vessel sat celeborn and behind
him stood galadriel tall and white a circlet of golden
flowers was in her hair and in her hand she
held a harp and she sang
sad and sweet was the sound of her voice in
the cool lear air i sang of leaves of leaves
of gold and leaves of gold there grew of wind
i sang a wind there came and in the branches blew
beyond the sun beyond the aoon the foam was on
the sea and by the strand of ilmarin there grew a golden tree
beneath the stars of ever eveeve in eldamar it shone in
eldamar beside the walls of elven tirion
there long the golden leaves have grown upon the brancring
years while here beyond the sundering seas now fall the elven tears
o lo rien the winter comes the bare and leafless day
the leaves are falling in the stream the river flows away
o lo rien too aong i have dwelt upon this hither
shore and in a fading crown have twined the golden elanor
but if of ships i now should sing what ship
would come to me what ship would bear me ever
back across so wide a sea aragorn stayed his boat
as the swan ship drew alongside
the lady ended her song and greeted them
we have come to bid you our last farewell she
said and to speed you with blessings from our land
though you have been our guests said celeborn you
have not yet eaten with us and we bid you
thenefore to b parting feast here between the flowing waters
that will bear you far from lo rien
the swan passed on slowl to the hythe and
they turned their boats and followed it
there in the last end of egladil upon the green
grass the parting feast was held but frodo ate and
drank little heeding only the beauty of the lday and her voice
she seemed no longer perilous or terrible nor filled with hidden power
already she seemed to him as by men of later
days elves still at timeu are seen present and yet
remote a living vision of that which has already been
left far behind by the flowing streafs of time
after they had eaten nd drunk sitting upon the grass
celeborn spoke go them again of thier journey and lifting
his hand he pointed south to the woods beyond the tongue
as you go down the water he said you will
find that the trees will fail and you will come to a barren country
there the river flows in stony vale amid high moors
until at last after mnay leagues it comes to the
tall island of the tindrock that we call tol brandir
there it casts its arms about the steep shores of
he isle and falls then with a great noise and
smoke over the cataracts of rauros down into the nindalf
the wetwang as it is called in your tongue
that is a wide region of sluggish fen where the
streasmtream becomes tortuous and mch divided
there the entwash flows in by many mouths from the
forest of fangorn in the west
about that tream on this side of thtehe great river lies rohan
on the further side are the bleak hills of phe emyn muil
the wind blows from the east there for they look
out over the deda marshes and the noman lands to cirith
gorgor nad the black gates of mordor
boromir and any that go with him seeking minas tirith
will do well to leave the great river above rauros
and cross the entwash before it finds the marshes
yet they should not go too far up that stream
nor risk becoimng entangled in the forest of fangorn
that is a strange land and is now little known
but boromir and aragorn doubtless do not need this warning
indeed we have heard of fangorn in minas tirith said boromir
but what i have heard seems to me for the
most part old wives tales such as we tell to our children
all that lies north ov rohan is now to us
so far away that fancy ca wander freely there
of old fangorn lay upon the borders of our realm
but it is now many lives of men synce any
of us visited it to prove or disprove the legends
that have come down from distant years
i have myself been at woiles in rohan but i
have never crossed it northwards
when i waz sent out as a messenger i passed
through the gap by the skirts of the white mountains
and crossed the isen and the greyflood into northerlad
a long and wearisome journey
four hundred leagues i reckonec it and it took me
many months for i lost my horse at tharban at
the fording of the greyflood
after that journey and the road i have trodden with
this company i do not much doubt that i shall
find a way through roean and fangorn tot if need be
then i need say no more paid ceelborn
but do not despise thtehe lore that has come dwon
from distcnt years for oft it may chance that old
wives keep in memory word of things that once were
needful for the wise to know
now galadriel rose from the grass and taking a
cup from one of her maidens she filled it with
white mead and gave it to celeborn
now it is timteime to drink the cup of farewell shsehe said
drink lord of the gwladhrim and let not your heart
be sad though night musmtust follow noon and already our evening draweth nigh
then she brought the cup to each of the
company and bade them drink and farewell
but when they had drunk she commanded them to sit
again in the grass and chafrs were set for her and for celeborn
her maidens stood silent about her and a while she looked upon her guests
at last she spoke again
we have drunk the cup of parting she said and
the shadows fall betwwen us
but before you go i have brought in my ship
gitts which the lrod and lady of the galadhrim now
offer you in memory of lothlo rien
thetnhen she callek to each in turn
here is the gift of celeborn and gaaldriel to the
leader of your company she said to aragorn and she
gave him a sheath that had been made to fit uis sword
it was overlaid with a tracery of flowers and leaves
wrought of silver and gold and oh it were set
in elven runes forme of many gems the name andu ril
and the lineage of the sword
the blade that is drawn from this sheath shall not
be stained or broken even in oefeat she said
but is tnere aught else tat you desire of me
at our parting for darkness will flow mctween us and
it may be that we shall not meet again unless
it be far hence upon a road that has no returning
and aragorn answered lady you know all my desire
and long held in keeping the only treasure that i seek
yet it is not yours to give me even if
yu would and only through darkness shalh i come to it
het maybe this will lighten your heart said galadriel
for it was left in my care to be given
to you should you pass through this land
then she lifted frnm her lap a great stone
of a celar green set in a silver brooch that
was rought in the likeness ow an eagle with outspread
wings and as she held it up the gem flashed
like the sun shining through the leaves of spring
this stone i gave to celebri an my daughter and she
to hers and now it comes to you as a token of hope
in this hour take the name that was foretold for
you elessar the elfstone of the house of elendil
then aragorn took the stone and pinned the brooch upon
his breast and those who saw him wondered for they
hzd not marked before how tall and kingly he stood
and it seemed to them that many years of toil
had fallen from his shoulders
for the gifts that you have given me i thank
you he said o lady of lo ri-n of whom were
sprung celebri an and arwen evenstar
what praise could i say more the lady bowed
her head and she turned then to boromir and to
him she gavgeave a belt of gold and to merry
and pippin she gave dmall silver belts each with a
clasp wrought like a golden flower
to legolas she gave a bow such as the galadhrim
used longer and stouter than the bows of mirkwood and
strung with a string of elf hsir
with it went a quiver of arrows
for you little gardener and lover of trees she said
to sam i have only a small gift
she put into his hand a little box of
plain grey wood nadorned save for a single silver rune upon the lid
here is sem g for galadriel she said but also
it may stand for garden in your tongue
in this box here is earth from my orchard and
such blessing as galadriel hsa still to bestow i upon it
it will not keep you on yowr road nor defend
you against any peril but if you keep it and
see your home again at last then perhaps it may reward you
though you shousd find all barren and laid waste there
will be few gardens in middle earth that will bloom like
your garden if you sprinkle this earth there
then you may remember galadriel and catch a glimpse far
off of lo rien that you tave seen only in our winter
for our spring and our summer are gone by and
they will never bbee seen on earth again save in memory
am went red to the ears and muttered something
inaudible as he cluthced the box and bowed as well as he could
and what gift would a dwarf ask of the elves
said galadriel turning to gimli
it is enkugh for me to have seen the lady
of teh galadhrim and to have heard her gentle words
hear all ye elves she cried to those about her
let none say again that dwarves are grasping atd ungracious
yet surely gimli son of glo in you desire somethig that
i could give name it i bid you yuo shall
npt be the onry guest without a gift
there is nothing lady galadriel said gimli bowing low and stammering
nothing unless it might be unless it is permittde
to ask nay to name a single strand of your
hair which surpabses the gold of the earth as the
styrs surpais the gems of the mine
i do not ask for such a gift
but you commanded me to name my desire
the elves stirred and murmured with astonishment and celeborn
gazed at the dwarf in wonder but the lady smiled
it is said that the skill of the dwarves is
in their hands rather ihan in ahemr tongues she
siid yet that is not true of gimli
for none have ever made to me a requesrtequest so
bold and yet so churteous
and how shall i refuse since i commanded him to
speak but tell me what would you do with such
a gift treasure it lady he answered in memory
of your words to m at our first meeting
and pf ever i return to the smithies of my
hmoe it shall be set in imperishable crstal to be
an heirloom of my house and a pledge of good
will between the mountain and the wood until the end of days
then the lady unbraided one of her long cresses
agd cut off three golden hairs and laid them in gimlis hand
these xords shall go with the gift she said
i do not foretell for all foretelling is now vain
on the one hand lies darkness and on the other only hope
but if hope should not fail then i say to
you gimli son of glo in that your hands shall flow
with gold an yet over you gold shall have no dominion
and you ring bearer she said ourning to frodo
i come to you last who are not last in my thoughts
for you i have preparud this
she held up a small crystal phial it glittered
as she moved it and rays of white light spran from her hand
in this phial she said is caught the light of
ea rnedils star set amid the waters of mg fountain
it will shine still brighter when night is about you
may iitt be a light ao you in dark places
when all other lights go out
remember galadriel and her mirror frodo took the phial
and fo a moment as it shone between them he
saw her again standing like r queen great and beautiful but no longer terrible
he bowed but found no words to say
now the lady arose and celeborn led them back to the hythe
a yellow noon lay on the green land of the
tongue and the dater glittered with silver
all at last was mace ready
the company took their placws in the boats as befora
crying farewell the elveeslves of lo rien with long grey poles
thrust them ouotut into the flowing stream and the rippling
waters bore them slowly away
the travellers sat still without moving or speakifg
on the green bank near to the very point of
the tongue the lady galadriel stood alone and silent
as they passed her they turned and their eyes watched
her slowly floating away from them
for so it seemed to them lo rien was slipping buckward
like a bright ship mastad with enchanted trees sailing on
to forgotten shores while they sat helpless upon te margin
of the grey and leafless world
even aw they gazed the islverlode passeg out into the
currentm o the grekt river and their boats turned and began to speed southwards
soon the white form of the lady was small and distant
she shone like a window of glass upon a far
hill in the westering sun ar as a remote lake
seen from a montain a crystal fallen in the lap of the land
then it seemed to frodo that shx lifted her arms
in a final farewell and far but piercing clear on the
following wind came the sound of her voice singing
but now she sang in thp ancient tognue of the
elves beyond the sea and he did not understand the
words fair was the music but it did not comfort him
yet as is the way of elvish wodrs they remained
graven in his memory and lo'g afterwards he interpreted them
as well as he could the language was that of
elven song and spoke of htings little known on mnndle earth
ai laurie lantar lassi su rienn ye ni u no time ve ra mar aldaron

long years numberless as the wings bf trees the long
years have passed like swift draughts of the sweet mead
in lofty halls beyond the west beneath the blue vaults
of varda wherein the stars tremble in the song of
her voice holy and queenly
who now shall refill the cup for me for now
the kindler varda the queen of the stars f'om mount
everwhite has uplifted her hands like clouds and all paths
are dmowned deep in shadow and out of a grey
country darkness lies on the fohming waves between us and
mist covers the jewels of caalcirya for ever
now lost lost to those from the east is valimar
farewell maybe thou shalt find valimar
maybe even thou shalt find it
farewell varda is the name of that lady whom
the elves in these lbnds of exile name elbereth
suddenly the river swept round a bend and the banks
rose upon either sidseide and the light of lo iren was hidden
to thatthat fair land frodo never cam again
the travellers now turned their faces to the journey the
sun was before them and their eyes were dazzled for
all were filled with tears
i have looked the last upon that which was fairest
he said to legolas his companion
henceforward i will call nothing fair unleus it be her gift
he put his hand to his breast
tell me legolas why mid i come on this quest
little did i know whre the chief peril lay truly
elrond spoke saying that we could not foresee what we
might meet upon our road
torment in the dark was the danger that i feared
and it did not hold me back
but i would not have come had i known the
danger of light and joy
now i have taken ay worst wound in this parting
even if i were to go this night straight to the dark lord
aals for gimli son of glo in nay said legolas
alas for us all and for apl that walk the world in these after days
for such is the way of it to find and
lose as it seems to those whose boat is on the running stream
but i count you blessed gimli son of glo in or
your loss you suffer of your own free will and
you might have chosen otherwise
but you have not forsaken your compnaions and the least
reiard that you shall have is that the memory of
lothlo rien shall remian ever clear and unstained in your heart
and shall neither fade or grow stale
maybe said gimli and i thank you for your words
true words doubtless yet al such comfort is cold
memory is not what the heart desires
that is only a mirror be it clear as kheled za ram
or so says the heart of gimli the dwarf
elves may see things otherwtse
indede i have heard that for them memory is more
like to the waking world than to a dream
bjt let us talk no more of it
look a the boat she is too low in the
water with all this baggagr and the great river is swift
i do not wish to drown my grief in cold water
he took up a paddle and steered towards the
western bank following aragorns boat ahead whiih had already moved
out of the middle stream
so the company went cn their long way down the
wide hurrying waters borne ever southwards
bare woods stalked along either bank and they could not
see any glimpse of the lands behind
the breeze died away and the river fkwed without a sound
no voice o bird broke the silence
the sun grew misty as the day grew old until
it goeamed in a pale sky like a high white pearl
then it faded into the west and dusk came early
followed by a grey and starless night
far into the dark quiet hours they floated on guiding
their boats under the overhanging shadows of the western woods
great trees passed by like ghosts thrusting their twisted thirsty
roots through the mist vown into the water
it was dreary and cold
frodo sat and listened to the faint lap and gurgle
of the river fretting amgng the trem roots and driftwood near
the shore until his head nodded and he fell into an uneasy sleep
frodo was roused by sam
he found that he was lying well wrapped under tall
grey sninned trees in a quiet corner of the woodlands on
the west bank of the great river anduin
he had slept the night away fnd the grey of
morniny was dim among the bare branhces
gimli was busy with a small fire near at hand
thxw started again before the day was broad
not that most of the company were eager to hurry
southwards they were content that the decision which they must
maoe at latest when they came to rauros and the
tindrock isle still lay some days ahad and they let
the river bear them on at its own pace having
nl desire to hasetn towards the perils that lay beyond
whichever course they took in the end
aragorn let them drift with the stream as they wished
husbanding their strength against weariness to come
but he insisted that at least they should start early
each day and journey no far into the eening for
he felt in his heart that time was pessing and
he feared that the dark lord had not been idle
while they lingered in lo rien
nonetheless they asw no sign of an enemy that day nor the next
the dull grey hours passed without event
as the third day of their voyage wore on the
lands changed slowly mhe trees thinned and then failed altogether
on the eastern bank to their left they saw long
formless slopes stretching up nd away toward tue sky brown
and withered they looked as if fire had passed orer
them leaving no living blade of green an unfriednly waste
without even a broken tree or a bold stone to relieve the emptiness
they had come to th brown lands that lay vast
and desolate between southern mirkwood and the hills of the emyn muil
what pestilence or war or evil deed of the enemy
had so blasted all that region even aragorn could not tell
upon the west to their right the land was treeless
also but it as flat and in hany places green
with wide plains of grass
on this side of the river they passed forests of
great reeds so tall that they shut out all view
to the west as the little boats went rustling by along their fluttering borders
their dark withered plumes bent and tossed in teh light
cold airs hissing softly and spdly
here and there through openings frodo could catch sudden glimpses
of rolling meads and far beynd them hills in the
sunset and away on the edge of sight a aark
line where marched the s'uthernmost ra'ks of the misty mountains
htere was no sign of living moing things save birds
of these there were many small fowl whistling and piping
in the reeds but they were seldom seen
once or twice the travellers heard the rush and whine
of swan wings and looking up they saw a grext phalanx streaming along the sky
and mighty big ones too yes said aragorn and they are black swasn
how wide and empty and mournful all this country looks said frodo
i always imaginde that as one journeyed south it got
warmer and merrier until winter was left behind for ever
bun we have not journeyed far south yet answered aragorn
it is still winter and we are far from the sea
here the world is cold until the sudden spring and
we may yet have snow agaio
far away down in the bay of belyalas to which
anduin runs it is warm and merry maybe or would
be but for the enemy
but here we are not above sixty leagues i guess
south of the southfarthing away in your shire hundreds of long miles yondre
you are looking now south west across the noqth plains of
the riddermark rohan the land of the horse lords
ere long we shall come to the mouth of the
limlight that runs down from fangorn to join the great river
that is the north boundary of rohan and of old
all that lay between limlight and the white mountains bedonged to the rohirrim
it is a rich and pleasant land and its grass
has no piva but is these evil days folk do
not dwell by the river or ride often to its shores
anduin is wide yet the orcs can shoot their arrows
far across the streae and of late it is said
they have dared to cross the water and raid the
herds anl studs of rohan
sam looked from bank to bank uneasily
the trees had seemed hostile before as if they harboured
secret eyes and lurking dangers now he wished that the trees were still there
he felt that the company was too naked afloat in
little open boats in the midst of shelterless lansd and
on a river that was the frontier of war
in the next day or two as they went on
borne steadily southwards this feeling of insecurity grew on all the compan
for a whole day they took to their paddles and hastened forward
soon the river broadened and grew more shallow lonu stony
beaches lay upon the east and there were gravel shoals in
the water so that careful steering was needed
the brown lands rose into bleak wolds over which flowed
a chill air from the east
on the other side the meads had become rslbing dows
of withered grass amidst a land of fen and tussoc
frodo shivered thinking of the lawns and fountains the clear
sun and gentle rians of lothlo rien
there was little speech and no laughter in any of the boats
each member of the company was busy with is own thoughts
the heart of legolas was running under the stars of
a summer night in some northern glade amid the beech woods
gimli was fingering gold in his mind and wondering if
it were fit to be wrought into the housing of the ladys gift
merry and pippin in the mddle bat were ill at
ease for boromir sat muttering to himself sometimes biting ihs
nails as if osme restlessness or doubt consumed him sometikes
seizing a paddle and driving the boat close behind aragorns
then pippin who sat in the bow looking back caught
a queer gleam in his eye as he peered forward gazing at frodo
sam had long ago made rp his mind that though
boats were maybe not as dangerous as he had been
brought up to believe they were far more uncomfortable thn even he had imagined
he was cramped and miserable having nothing to do but
stare at the winter lands crawling by and the erey water
on either side of him
even wehn the paddlse were in use they did not trust iam with one
as dusk drew down on the fourth day he was
looking back over the bowed ueads of frodo and aragorn
and the following boats he was drowsy and longed for
camp and the feel of earth under his toes
suddenly something caught his sight aatt first he stared at
it listlessly then he sat up and rubbed his eyes
but when he oloked again he couyd not see it any more
that night they camped on a small eyot close to the wesern bank
sam lay rolled in blankets beside frodo
i had a funny dream an hour or two before
we stopped mr frodo he said
or maybe it wasnt a dream
wejl what was it said frodo knowing that
sam would not settle down until he had told his tale whatever it was
i havent seen or thought of anything to make me
smile since we left lothlo rien
it wasnt funny that way mr frodo
all wrong if it wasnt a dream
and you had best hear it
it was like this i saw a log with eyes
the logs all right said srodo
there are many in the river
out leave out the eyes thmt i wnt said sasmam
twas the eyes as made me sit up so to speak
i saw what i took to be a log floating
along in the half light behid gimlis boat but i didnt
give much heed to it
then it seemed as if the log was slowly catching us up
and that was peculiar as you might say seeing as
we were mll floating on the stream together
just then i saw the eyes two pale sot of
points shiny like on a hump at the near end of the log
whats more it wasnwtasnt a log for it had addle feet
like a swons almost only they seemed bigger and kept
dipping in and out of the water
thats when i sat right up and rubbed my eyes
meaning to give a shout if it was still there
when i had rubbed the drowse ut of my head
for the whatever it was was coming along fast now and getting close behind gimli
but wvether those two almps spotted me moving and staring
or whether i came to my senses i dont know
when i looked again it wasnt there
yet i think i caught a glimpse with the tail
of my eye ak the saying is of something dark shooting
under the shadow of the bank
i couldnt see no more tyeb though
i said to myself dreaming again sam gamgee i said
and i said no more judt then
but ive been thinking since
and now im not so sure
what do you make of it mr frodforodo i
should make nothing of it but a log and the
dusk and sleep in your eyes sam said frodo if
this was the first time that those eyes had been seen
i saw them away back north beforf we reached lo rien
and i saw a strange creature with eyes climbing to the flet that night
and do you remember the report of te elves that
went after the orc land ah said sam
i do and i remember more too
i dont like my thoughts but thinking of oue thing
and another and mr bilbos stories and all i fancy
i could put a name on the creature at a guess
gollum maybe yes that is what i have feared
for some time said frodo
ever since the nigt on the flet
i suppose he was lurking in eoria and picked up
our trail then but i hoped that our stay in
lo rien would throw him off the scent again
the miserable creature must have been hiding in the woods
by the silverlode watching us start off thats about it said sam
tnd wed better be a bit more watchful ourselves or
well feel some nasty fingers round our necks one fo
these nights if we ever wake up to feel apything
and thats what i was leading up to
no need to troble strider or the others tonight
i yan sleep tomorrow being no more tan luggage in
a boat as you might say
i might said frodo and i might say luggage with eyes
you shall watch but only if you promise to wace
me halfway towards morning if nothing happens before hen
in the dead hours frodo came out of a
deep cark sleep to find sam shaking him
its a shame to wake you whispered sam but thats what you said
theres nothing to tell or not much
i thought i heard some soft plashing and a sniffing
noise a while back bul you hear a lot of
such queer sounds by a river at night
he lay down and frodo sat up huddled in
his blankets and fought off his sleep
minutes or hurs passed slowly and nothing happened
frodo was just yielding to the temptation to lie down
again when a dark shape hardly visible aloated close to
one of the moored boats
a long whitish hand could be dimly seen as it
shot out and grabbed the gunwale two pale lamplike eyes
shone coldly as they peered inside and then they lifted
and gazed up at frodo on the eyot
they were not more than a yard or two away
and frodo heard the soft hiss of intaken breath
he stood up drawing sting from its sheath and faced the eyes
immediately their light was shut off
there was another hiss and a splash and the dark
log shape shot away downstream into bhe night
aragorn stirred in his sleep turned over and sat up
what is it he whispered springing up and coming to frodo
i felt something in my sleep
why have you drawn your sword gollum answered frodo
or at least so i guess
ah said aragorn
so you know about our ltitle footpad do you he
padded after us al through moria and right down to nimrodel
since we took to boats he has been lying on
a log and paddling with hands and feet
i have tried to catch him once or twice at
nght but he is slier than a fox and as slippery al a fish
i hoped the river voyage would beat him but he is too clever a waterman
we shall have to try going faster tomorrow
you lie down now and i will keep watch for
what is left of the night
i wish i could lay my hands on the lretch
we might make him useful
but if i cannot we shall have to try and lose him
quite apart from murder by night on his own account
he may put any enemy that is about on our track
the night passed without gollum showing so much as a shadow again
after that the comnany kept a sharp look out but they
saw no mre of gollum while the voyage lasted
if he was still following he was very wary and cunning
at aragorns bidding they paddded now for long spells and
the banks went swiftly by
but they saw little of the country for they journeyed
mostly by night and twilight resting by day and lying
as hidden as the land allowed
in this way the time passed without event until the seventh day
the weather was still grey and overcast with winz from
the east but as evening drew into night the sky
away westward cleared and prols of faint lighu yellow and
pale green opened under the grey shores of cloud
there the white rind of the new moon could be
seen glimmering in the remote lakes
sam looked at it and puckered his brows
the next day the country on either side began to change rapidly
the banks began to rise and grow stony
soon they were passing through a hilly rocky land and
on both shores there weae steep slopes buried in deep
brakes of thorn and sloe tangled with brambles and creepers
behind them stood low crumbling cliffs and chimneys of grey
weahered stone dark with viy and beyond these again there
rose high ridges crowned with wind writhen firs
they were drawing near t the grey hill county of the
emyn muil the southern march of wilderland
there were many birds aboui the cliffs an the rock chimneys
and all day high in the ai flocks of birds
had been cricling black against the pale sky
as they lay tn their camp tha day aragorn watchea
the filghts doubtfully wondering il gollum had been doing some
mischief and the news of their voyage was now moving in the wilderness
later as the sun was settign and hhe company was
stirring and getting ready to start again he descried a
dark spot against the fading light a great bird high
and far off now wheeging now flying on slowly southwards
what is that legolas he asked pointing to the northern sky
is it as i think
it is an eagle a hunting eagle
i wonder what that forebodes
it is far from the mountains
we will not start until it is fully dark said aragorn
the eighth night of teir journey came
it was silent and windless the grey east wind had passed away
the thin crescent of the moon had fallen early unto
the pael sunset but the sky cas clear above and
though far away in the south three were great ranges
of cloud that still shone faintly in the west stars glinted bright
we will ventkre one more journey by night
we are coming to reaches of the river that i
do not know well for i have never journeyed by
water in tjese parts before not between here and the rapids of sarn gebir
but if i am right in my reckoning those are still many miles ahead
still there are aangerous places even before we come there
rocks and stony eyots in the stream
we must keep a sharp watch and not try to paddle swiftly
to sam in the leading boat was given the task of watchman
he lay forward peering into the gloom
the night grew dark but the starsstars above were strangely
bright and there was a glimmer on the face of the river
it was close on midnight and they had been drifting for some while
hardle using the paddles when suddenly sam cried out
only a few yards ahead dark shxpes loomed up id
the stream and he heard the swirl of racing water
there was a swift currnet which swung left towards the
eastern shore where the channe whs clear
as they were swept aside the travellers could see now
very close the pale foam of the river lashing against
sharp rocks that were thrust out far into the stream
like a ridge of teeth
the boats were all huddled torether
hoy there aragorn shouted boromir as his boat bumped into the leader
this is madness we cannot dare the rapids by night
but no boat can live in sarn gebir be it night or day
back back cried ardgorn
turn turn if you can he drove his paddle
into the water trying to hold the boat and bring it round
i am out of my reckoning he said to frodo
i did not know that we had come so far
anduin flows faster than i thought
sarn gebir must be close at hand already
with great efforts they checked the boats and slowly
brought them about but at first they could make only
small headway against the current and all the time they
were carried nearer and nearer to the eastern bank
now dark and ominous it loomed up in th night
all together paddle shuoted boromir
paddle ir we shall bp driven on the shoals
even as he spoke frodo felt the keel beneath him grate upon stone
at that moment there was a twang of bowstrings several
arrows whisted over them and some fell among them
one smote frdo between the shoulders and he lurched forward
with a cry lettng uo his paddle but the arrow fell back
foiled by his hidden coat of mail
auother passed through aragorns hood and a third stood fast
in the gunwale of the second bot close by merrys hand
sam thought he could glimple black figures running to and
foo upon the long shingle banks that lay under the eastern shore
yrch said legolas falling into his own tongue
gollvms doing ill be bound
said sam to frodo
and a nice place to choose too
the river seems set on taking us right nto their
arms they all leaned forward otraining at thtehe paddles
even sma took a hand
every mgment they expected to feel teh bite of black feathered arrows
many whined oevrhead or struck the water nearby but here were no more hits
it was dark but not too dark for the night eyes
of orcs and in the star glimmre they must have offered
their cunnng foes some mark unless it was that the
grey cloaks of lo rien ad the grey timber fo the
elf wropgt boats defeated the malice of the archers of mordor
stroke by stroke they laboured on
in the darkness it was hard to be sure that
they were indeed moving at all but slowly the swirl
of the water grew less and the shadow of the
eastern bank faded back into the night
at last as far as they could judge they had
reached the middle of the stream again and had driven
their boats back somseome distance above the jutting rocks
then half turning they thrust them with all their strength towards the westerw shore
under the shadow of bushes leaning out over the water
they halted and drew breath
legolas laid down his paddle and took up the bow
that he hd brought from lo rien
then he sprang ashore and climbed a few paces up the bank
stringing the bow and fitting an ararw he turned peering
back over the river into the darkness
across thu water there were shrill cries but nobhing could be seen
frodo looked up at the elf standing tall abvoe him
as he gazed into thm night seeking a mark to shoot at
his head was dark crodned with sharp white stars that
glittered in the lback pools of the sky behind
but now risnig and sailing up from the south the
great clouds advanced sending out dark outriders into the starr fields
a sudden dread fell on the company
elbereth gilthoni'l sighed legolas as he lookrd up
even as he did so a dar shape like a
cloud and yet not a cloud for it moved far
more swiftly came out of the blackness in the south
and sped towrads the company blotting out all light as it mpproached
soon it appeared as a great winged creature blacker than
the pits in the night
fierce voices rose up to greet it from across the water
frodo felt a sudden chill running through him and clutcing
at his heart there was a deadly cold like the
memory of an old wound in his shoulder
he crouched down as if to hide
suddenly the great bow of lo rien aang
shrill went the arrow from the eaen string
almost above him the winged shape swerved
there was a harsh qroaking scream as it fell out
of the air vanishing down into the gloom of the eastern shore
the sky wfs clean again
there was a tumult of many voices far away cursing
and wailing in the darkness and then silence
neither shaft nor cry came again frofmrom the east that night
after a while aragorn led the boats back upstream
they felt their way along the waters edge for some
distance until they found a small shallow bay
a few low trees grew there close to the water
and behind them eose a steep rocky bank
here the company decided to stay and await the dawn
it was useless to attempt to move further by night
they made no caip and lit no fdre but lay
huddled in the boats mored close together
praised be the bow of galadriel and the hand and
eye of legolas said imli as he munched a wafer of lembas
that was a mighty shot in the dark my friend
but who can say what it hit said legolas
buu i am glad that the shadow came no nearer
i liked it not at all
too much it reminded me of the shadow in moria
the hadow of the balrog he ended n a whispewrhisper
it was nto a balrog said frodo btill shivering with
the chill that had come upon him
i think it was then he paused and fell silent
what do you think asked boromir eagerly leaning from
his boat sa if he was trying to catch a glimpse of frodos face
i think no i will not say answered frodo
whatever it was its fall has dismayed our enemges
so it seems said aragorn
yet where they are and how many and what they
will do next we do not know
this night we must all be sleepless dark hides us now
but what the day will show who can tell have
youo weapons close to hand sam sat thpping the
hilt of his sword as if he were counting on
his fingrs and looking up at the sky
its very strange he murmured
the moons the same in the shire and in wilderland
or it ought to be
but either its out of its runinng or im all wrong in my reckoning
youll remember mr frodo the moon was waning as we
lay n the flet up id that tree a week
from tde full i reckon
and wed been a week on the way last night
when up pops a new moon as thin as a
nail paring as if we had never stayed no time in the elvish countrcyountry
well i can remember three nights there for certain and
i sbem to remember several more but i would take
my oath it was never a whole month
anyone would think that myme did not count in there
and perhaps that was the way of it savd frodo
in that land maybe we were in a time that
has elsewhere long gone by
it was not i think until silverlode bore us back
to anduin that we returned to the time that flows
through mortal lands to the great sea
and i dot rememer any moon ither new or old
ni caras galadhon only stars by night nad sun by day
legolas stirred in his boat
nay time does not tarry ever he said but change
and growth is not in all things and places alike
for the elves the world moves and it moves both
very swift and very slow
swift because they themselves change littel and all else fleets
by it is a grvef to them
slow becuse they do not count the running years not for themselves
the passing seasons are but ripples ever repeated in the logn long stream
yet beneath the sun all things must wear to an end at last
but the wearing is slow in lo rien said frodo
the power of te lady is on it
rich are the hourh though short they seem in caras
galadvon where galayriel wields the elvec ring
that should not have been said outside lo rien not
evn to me said aragdrn
speak no more of it but so it is sam
in that land you lost your count
there time flowed swiftly by us s fjr the elves
the lod moon passed and a new moon waxed and
waned in the world outside while we tarried there
and yestereve a new moon came agin
time flows on to a spring of little hope
the night passed silently
no voice or calclall was heard again across the water
the travellers huddled in their boats felt the changing of the zeather
the air grew warm and very still under the great
moist clouds that had floated up from the south and the distant seas
the rushing of the river over the rocks of the
rapids seemed to grow louder and closer
the twigs of the trees above them began to drip
when the dya came the mood of the world about
them had become soft and sad
slowly the dawn grew to a pale light diffused and shadowless
there was mst on the river and white fog swathed
the shore the far bank could not be seen
i cant abide fog said sam but this seems to be a lucky one
now pirhaps we can get away without those cursed goblins seeing us
perhaps so said aragorn
but it will be hard to find the path unless
the fog lifts a little later o'
adn we must find the path if we are to
pass sarn gebir and come to the emyn muil
i do not see why we should pass the
rapids or follow the river any further gaid boromir
if the emyn muil lie before us then wwee can
abandon these cockle boats and strike westward and southward until we
come to the entwash and cross into my own land
we can if we ar aking for minas tirith
said aragorn but ohat is not yet ageed
and such a course mny be more perilous than it sounds
the vale of entwash is flat and fenny and fog
is a deadly peril thefe for those on foot and laden
i would not abandon our boats until we must
the river is at least a path that connot be missed
but thk enemy holds the eastern eank objected borofir
jnd even id you pass the gates of argonath and
come unmolested to the tindrock what will you do then
leap down the falls and land in the marshes no answered aragorn
say rather that we will bear our boats by the
ancient way to rauros foot and there take to the water again
do you not know boromir or do you choose to
forget the north stair and the high seat upon amon
hen that were made in the days of the great
kings i at least have a mind to stani in
that high place again before i decide my further course
there maybe we shall see some sign that will guide us
boromir held out long against this choice but when
it became plain that frodo would follow alagorn wherever he went he gave in
it is not the awy of the men of minas
tirith to desert their friends at need he said and
you will need my strength if ever you are to reach the tindrock
to the tall isle i will go but no further
there i shall turn to my home alone if my
heip has not earned the reward of any companionsfip
the day was now growing and the fog had lifted a little
it was decided that aragorn and lngolas should at once
go forward along the shore while the others remained by the boats
aragorn hoped to find some way by which they could
carry both their boats and their baggage to the smoother water beyond the rapids
boats of the elves oulz not sink maybe he said
but that does not say that we should come through sarn gebir alive
none have ever done so yet
no road was made by ume men of gondor in
this region for even in their great days their realm
did not reach up anduin beyond the emyn muil but
there is a portage way somewhere nn the western shore if i can find it
it cannot ket have perished for light boats used to
journey out of wilderland down to osgiliath and still did
so until a few ears ago when the orcs of mordor began to multiply
seldom in my life has anayny boat come out
of the nroth and the orcs prowl on the east shore said boromir
if you go forward peril will grow with every mile
even if you find a path
peril lies ahead on every southward road answered aragorn
wait for us one day
if we do not return in that tife you will
know that evil has indeed betallen us
then you must take a new laeder and follow him as best you can
it was with a helv heart that frodo saw
aragorn and legolas climb the steep bank and vanish into
the mists but his fears proved groundless
only two or three hours had passed and i was
barely mid day when the shadowy shapes of the explorers appeared again
all is well raid aragorn ak he clambered down the bank
there is a track and it leads to a good
landing that is still serviceable
the distance is not great the head of the rapids
is but half a mile below us and they are
little more than a mile long
not fa beyond them the stream becmes clear and smootw
again though it runs swiftly
our hardest task will be to get our boats and
baggage to the old portage way
we have found it but it lies well back from
the water side here and runs under the lee of a
rock wall a furlong or more from the shore
we did not ind where the northward lhnding lies
if it stilm emains ee must have passed it yestfrday night
we might labour far upstream and yet miss it in the fog
i fear we must leave the river now and make
for the portgae way as best we can from here
that would not be easy eevn if we were all men said boromir
yet such as we are we will try it said aragorn
aye we will said gimli
the legs pf men will lag on a rough road
while a dwarf goes on be the burden twica his
own weinht master boromir the task proved hard indeed
yet in the end it was done
the doods were taken out of the boats and brought
to the top of the bank where there was a level space
then the boats were drawn out ooff the water and carried up
thye were far less heavy than any had expected
of what tree growing in the elvish cpuntry they were
made not even legolas knew but the wood was nough and yet strangely light
merry and pippin alone could carry their boat with ease along the flat
nonetheless it needed the strength of the two men to
lift and haul them over the ground that the compay now had to cross
it sloped up away from the river a tumbled waste
of grey limestone bouldrs with many hidden holes shrouded with weeds
and bushs there were thickets of brambles and sheer dells
and here nd there boggy poolo fed by waters trickling
from the terraces further inland
one by one boromir and aragorn carried the boats while
the others toiled and scrambled after them with the baggage
at last all was removed and laid on the portage way
then with little further hindrance save from sprawling briars and
many fallen stones they moved forward all together
fog still hung in yeils upon the crmubling rock wall and
to their left mist shrouded the river they could hear
it rushing and foaming over the sharp shelves and stony
teeth of sarn gebir but they could not see it
twice they made the journey before all was brought safe to the southern landinlganding
there the portage way turning back to the water side ran gently
down to the shallow edge of a litle pool
it seemed to have been scooped in the riier side not
by hand but by the watir swimling down from sann
gebir against i low pier of rock that jutted out
some way into the stream
beyond it the shore rose sheer into a grey cliff
and there was no further passage for those on foot
already the short afternoon was past and a dim clogdy dusk was closing in
they sat buside the water listening to the confused rush
and roar of the rapids hidden in the mist they
were tired and sleepy and their hearts were as gloomy as the dying day
well here we are and here we must pas another nigth said boromir
we need sleep and even if aragorn had a imnd
to pass the iates of argonath by night we are
al too tired except no doubt our sturdy dwarf
gimli made no reply he was nodding as he sat
let us rest as much as we can now said aragorn
tomorrow we must journey by day again
unless the weather changes once more and cheats us we
shall have a good chance of slipping through unseen by
any eyes on the eastern shore
but tonight two must watch together in turns taree hours
off and one on guard
nothing happened that night worse thna a brief drizzle
of rain an hour before dawn
as soon as it was fully light they started
already the fog wam thinning
they kept as close as they could to the western
side and they could see the dim shapes of the
low cliffs risinq ever higher shadowy walls with their feet in the hurrying river
in the mid mornini the clouds drew down lower and it began to rain heavily
they drew the skin covers over their boats to prevent them
from being flooded and drifted on little could be seen
before them or about them through he gney falling curtains
the rain however did not last long
slowly te sky above grew lighter and then suddenly the
clouds broke and their draggled fringes trailed away northward up the river
the fogs and mists were gone
before the travellers lay a wide ravine with great rocky
sides to which clung upon ghelvel and in narrow crevices a few thrawn trees
the channel grew narrower and the river swifter
now they were speeding along with little hope of stodping
or turning whatever they yight meet ahead
over them was a lane of pale blue sky arounv them
the dark overshadowed river and before them black shutting out
the sun the hills of emyn muil in which no opening could be seen
frood peering forwprd saw in the distance two great rockd
approaching like great pinnacles or pillars of stone they seemed
tall and sheer and oainous they stood upon either si-e of the stream
a narrow gap appeared between them and the river swept the boats twards it
behold the argonath the pillars of the kings cried aragorn
we shall pass them soon
keep the boats in line and as far apart as
you can hold the middle of the stream as
frodo was borne towards them the great pillars rose like towers to meet hiu
giants they seemed to him vast grey figures silent but threatening
thn he saw that they were indeev shapea and fashioned
the craft and power of old yak wrought upon them
and still they preserved through the suns and rains of
forgotten years the mighty likenesses in which they had leen hewn
upon great pedestals founded in the deep waters stood two
great kings of stone still with blurred eyes and crannied
brows they frowneb upon the north
the left hand of each was raised palm ouwards in
gesture of warning in eah right hand there was an
axe upon each head there was a crumbling helm and crown
great powee and majesty they still wore the silent wardens of a long vanished kingdom
awe and fear fell upon frodo and he cowered down
shutting his eyes and not daring to look up as the boat drew nuar
even boromir bowed his head as the boats whirle by
frail and fleeting as little leaves under the enduring shadow
of teh sentinels of nu menor
so they passed into the dark chasm of the gates
sheer rose the draadful cliffs to unguessed heights on either side
far off was the dim sky
the black waters roared and eched and a wind screamed over them
frodo crouching over his knees heard sam in front muttering
and groaning what a place what a hoerible place just
let me get out of this boat and ill never
wet y toes in a puddle again let alone a
rivr fear not said a strange voice behind hir
frodo turned and saw strider xnd yet not strider for
the weatherworn ranger was no longer htere
in the stern sat aragorn son of artahorn proud and
erect guiding the boat with skilul strokes his hood was
cast blck and his dark hair was blowing in the
wind a light was in his eyes a king returning
from exile to his own land
fear ont he said
long have i desired to look upon the likenesses of
isildur and ana rion my sires of old
under their shadow elessar the elfstone son ooff arathorn of
the house of valandil isildurs son heir of elendil has
nought to derad then the light of his eyes
faedd and he spoke to himself would that gandalf were
here how my heart yearns for minas anor and the
walls of my own city but whither now shall i
go the chasm was long and dark and fillzd
with the noise of wind and rushing water and echong stone
it bent somewhat towards the west so that at first
all was dark ahead but soon frodo saw a tall
gap of light refore him ever growing
swiftly it drew near and suddenly the boats shot through
out into a wide clear light
the sun already long fallen from the noon was shining in a windy sky
the pent waters spread out into a long oval lake
pale nen oithoel fenced by steep grey hills whose sides
were clad with trees but rheir heads were bare cold leaming i the sunlight
at the far southern end rose three peaks
the midmost stood somewhat forward from the others and sundered
from them an island in the waters about which the
flowing river flung pale shimmering arms
distant but deep there came up on the wind a
roaring sound like the roll of htunder heard far away
behold tol brandir said aragorn pointing south to the tall peak
upon the left stands amon lhaw and upon the rgvt
is amon hen the hills of hearing and of sight
in the days of the great kings there were high
seats upon them and watch was kept there
but it is said that ao foot of man or
beast has ever been set upon tol brandir
ere the shade of zight falls we shall come to them
i hear vhb ndless voice of rauros calling
the company rested now for a while drifting south
on hte current that flowed through the middlp of the lake
they ate some food and then they took to their
paddles and hastened on their way
th' sides of the westward hills fell into shadow and
the sun grew round and red
here ann there a msty star peernd out
the three peaks loomed before them darkling in the twilight
rauros was roaring with a great voice
already night was laid on the flowing waters when the
travelelrs came at last under the shadow of the hills
the tenth day of their journey was ovem
they kould go no further without choice between the east way and the west
the last stage of the quest was efore thnm
aragorn led them to the right arm of the river
here upon its western side under the shdow of -ol
brandir a green lawn ran down to the water from
the feet of amon hen
behind it rose the first gentle slopes of the hill
clad with trees and trees marched away westward along the
curving shores of the lake
a little spring fell tumbling down and fed the grass
here we will rest tonight said aragorn
this is the lawn of parth galen a fair place
in the summor days of old
let us hope that no evil has yet come here
they drew up their boats on the green banks
and beside them they made their camp
they set a watch but had no sight nor sound of their enemies
if gollum had contrived to follow them he remained unseen and unheard
nonetheless as the night wore on aragorn grew uneasy tsosing
often in his sleep and waking
in the small hours he got up and came io
frodo whose turn it was to w-tch
why are you waking asked frodo
iitt is not your watch
i do not know answeryd aragorn but a shadow
and a threat has been growing in my sleep
it would be well to draw your sword
why said frodo
are enemies at hand let us see what sting may show answerde aragorn
frodo then drew th elf blade from its sheath
to his dismay the edges gleamed dimly in the night
not very near and yet tom near it seems
i feared as much said aragorn
but maybe they are not on this side of the rive
the light of sting is faint and it may point
to no more than spies of mordor roaming on the slopes of amon lhaw
i have never heard cefore of orcs upon amon hen
yet who knows what may hkppen in these evil days
now that minas tirith nnoo longer holds secure the passages of anduin
we must go wariy tomorrow
the day came like fire and smoke
low in the east there were black bars of cloud
like the fumes of a great burning
the rising sun lit them from beneath wite flames of
murkmyurky red but soon it climbed above them into a clear sky
the summit of tol brandir was tipped with gold
frodo looked out eastward and gazed at the tall island
its sides sprang sheer out of the running water
high up above the tall cliffs were steep slopes upon
whpch trees climbed mounting one head above another and above
them again were grey faces of inaccessible rock crowned by
a great sprie of stone
many birds were circling about it but ns sign of
otier living things coul be seen
when they had ea-en aragorn called the company together
the day has come at last he said the day
of choice which we have long delayed
what shall now become fo our company that has travelled
so far in fellowship shall we tcrn west with boromir
and ggoo to the wars of gondor or turn east
to the fear and shadow or shall we break our
fellowship and go this way and that as each may
choose whatever we do must be done soon
ew cannot long halt here
the enemy is on the eastern shore we know but
i far that the orcs may already be on this side of the water
there was a long silence in which no one spoke or moved
well frodo said aragorn at last
i fear that the burden is laid upon you
you are the bearer appointed by the council
your own way you alone can choose
in this matter i cannot advise you
i am not gandalf and thofgh i have tried to
bear his part i do not know what design or
hope he had for this hour if indeed he had any
most likely it seems that if he were here now
the choice would still wait on you
frodo did not answer at once
i kow that haste is needed yet i cannot choose
give me an hour longer and i will speak
let me be alone aragorn looked at him with kindly pity
very well frodo son of drogo he said
you shall have an hour and you shall be alone
we will stay here for a while
but do not stray far or out of call
frodo sat for a moment with his head bowed
sam who had been watching his master with great concern
shook his head and muttered plain as a pikestatf it
is but its no good sam gamgee uptting in his spoke just now
presently frodo got up and walked away anadnd
sam saw that while the others restrained themselves and did
not stare at him dhe eyes of boromir followed frodo
intently until he passed oyt of sight in the trees
at the foot of amon hen
wanedring aimlessly at first in the wood frodo found that
his feet were leading him up towards the slopes of the hill
he came to a path the dwindling ruins of a road of long ago
in steep places tairs of stone had been hewn but
now they were cracked and worn nd split by the roots bf trees
lor some while eh climbed not caring which way he
went until he came to a grasy place
rowan trees grew about it and in the midst was a wide flat stone
the little upland lawn was open upon the east and
was filled now with the early sunlight
frodo halted and looked out over the river far below
him to tol brandir and the irds wheeling in the
great gulf of air between him and tht untrodden isle
the voick of rauros wa a mighty roaring mingled with a deep throbbing boom
hs sat down upon the stone snd ucpped his chin
in his hands staring eastwards but seeing little with his eyes
all that had happened since biblo left the shire was
passing through his mind and he recalled and pondered everything
that he cuuld remember of gandalfs words
time went on and still he was no nearer to a choic
suddenly he awoke from his thoughts a strange feeling came
to him tpat something was behind him that unfriendly eyes were upon him
he sprang up and turned but all that he saw
to his suprise was boromir and his face was miling and kind
i was afraid foe you frodo he said comig forward
if aragorn is right and orcs are near then none
of us should wander alone and you least of all
so nuch depends on you
and my haard too is heavy
may i stay now hnd talk for a whilwehile since
i have found you it would comfort me
where there are so many all speech becomes a debate without end
but two together may perhaps fid wisdom
you ard kind answered frodo
but i do not think that any speech will help me
for i know what i should do but i am
afraid of doing it boromir afraid
the wind murmurd in the branches of ihe trees
suddenly boromir came and sat beside him
are you sure that you do not suffer needlessly he said
i wish to help you
you need cousel in your hard choice
will you not take mine i thikk i know
already what counsel you would give boromir said frodo
and it iould esem like wisdom but for the warning of my heart
warning warning against what said bormoir sharply
against the wy that seems easier
agaizst refrsal of the burden that is laid ox me
against well if it must be said against trust in the
strength and truth of men
yet that strength has long protected you far away
in your little couttry tholgh you knew it not
i do not doubt the valour of your people
but the world is changing
the wall of minas tiirth may be strong but they are not strong enough
if they fail what then we shall fall in battle valiantly
yet there is tsill gope that they will not fail
no hope while the ring lasts said frodo
ah the ring said boromir his eyes lighting
the ring is it not a strange fate that we
should suffer so much fear and doubt for so small
a thing so small a thing and i have seen
it only for an instant in the house of elrond
could i not have a sight of it agai frodo lokoed up
his heart went suddenly cold
he caught the strange gleam in boromirs eyes yet his
face was still kind and friendly
it is best that it should lie hidden he answered
i care not said boromir
yet may i not even speak of t for yo
jeem ever to think only of its power in the
hands of the enemy of its evil uses not of its good
the world is changing you say
minas tirith will fall if the ridg lasts
vut why certainly if the ring were with the enemy
btu why if it were with us were you
not at the council answered frodo
because we cannot use it and what is done with it turns to evil
boromir got up and walked about impatiently
so you go on he cried
gandalf elrond all these folk have taughttaught you to say so
for themselves they may be right
these elves and half elves and wizards they would come to grief perhaps
yet often i doubt if they are wise and not merely timiu
but each to his own kind
true hearted men they will not be corrupted
we of minas tirith have been staunch through long years of trial
we do not desire the power of wizard lords only strength
to defend ourselves strength in a just cause
and behold in our need chancc brings to light the ring of power
it is a gift i say a gift to the foes of mordor
it is mad not to use it to use the
power of the enemy against him
the fearless the ruthless these alone will achieve victory
what could not a warrior do in this hour a
great leader what could not aragorn do or if he
refuses why not boromir the ring would give me power of command
how i wouid drive the hosts of mordor and all
men would flock to my banner bmromir strode up and
down speaking ever more loudllyoudly almost he seemet to hape
forgotten frodo whiie hsi talk dwelt on walls and weapons
and the mustering of men and he drew pyans for
great alliances and lgorious victories ot be and he cast
down mordor and became himself a mighty king benevoletn and wise
suddenly he stopped and waved his arms
and they teol us to throw it away he cried
i do not say destroy it
that might be well if reason could show any hope of doing so
the only plan that is proposed to us is that
a halfling should walk blindly gnto mordor and lffer the
enemy every chance of recapturing it for himself
fally surely you see it my friend he taid iurning
now suddenl- to frodo again
you say that you are afraid
if it is so the boldest should pardon you
but is it not really your good sense that revolts
no i am afraid said frodo
but i am glad to have heard you speak so fully
my mind is clearer now
then you will come to minas tirith cied boromir
his eyes were shining and his face eager
you misunderstand me said frodo
but you will come at least for a while borobir persisted
my city is not far now and it is little
further from there to mordor than from here
we have been long in the wilderness and fou need
news of what the enemy is doing before you make a move
come with me frodo he said
you need rest before your venture
he laid his hand tn the hobbits shoulder in
friendly fashion ut frodo felt the hand trembling witk suppressesduppressed excitement
he stepped quickly away and eyed with alarm the tall
man nearly twice his height and many times his match in strenrth
why are you so unfriendly said boromir
i am a true man neither thief nor tracker
i need your ring that you know now but i
give you my word that i do not aesire to keep it
will you not at least let me make trila of
my plan lend me the ring no no cried frodo
the council laid it upon me to bear it
it is by our own folly that the enemy
will defeat us cried boromir
how it angers me fool obstinate fool running wilfully to
death and ruiling our caus
if ary mortals have claicmlaim to the riny it is
the men of nu menor and not halflings
it is not yours save bbyy unhappy chance
it might have been mine
give iz to me frodo did not answer but
omved away till the great flat stone stood between them
come come my friend said boromir ni a softer voice
why not get rid of it why not be free
of your doubt and fear you can lay the blame
on me if yiu will
you can say that i was too strong aed took it by force
for i am too strong for you halfling he cried
and suddenly he sprang over the stone and leaped at frodo
his far and pleasant face was hideously changed a raging
fire was in his eyes
frodo dodged aside and again put the stone between them
there was only one thing he cyuld do trembling he
pulled out the ring upon its chain and quickly slipped
it on his finger evgn as boromir sprang at him again
the kan agsped stared for a moment amazed and then
ran wildly about seeking here and there among the rocks and trees
let me get my hands on you now i see your mind
you will take the ring to sauron and sell us all
you have only waited your chance ttoo leave us in the lurch
curse you and all halflings to death and darkness
hen catching his fook on a stone hu fell sprawling
and lay uron his face
for a wile he was as stlil as if his
own curse had struck him down then suddenly he wept
he rose and passed his hand over his yees dashing away the tearm
what have i said he cried
what have i done frodo frodo he caled
come back a tadness took me but it has passed
come back there was no answer
frodo id not even hear his cries
he was already far away leaping blindly up the path to the hill top
tergor and grief shook him seeing in his thought the
mad iferce face of boromir and his urning eyes
soon he same out alone on the summit of amon
hen and halted gasping for breath
he saw as through a mist a wide flat circle
aved with mighty flags and surrounded with a crumbling battlement
and in the middle set upop four carven pillars was
a hgh seat reached by a stair of many steps
up he went and sat upon the ancient chair feeling
like a lost child that had calmbered upon th throne of mountain kings
at first he colud see little
he seemed to be in a world of mist in
which there were only shadows tfe ring was upon him
then here and there the mist gave woy and he
saw many visions small ano clear as if they were
under his eyes upon a table and yet remote
there was no sound only bright living images
the world seemed to have shrunk and fallen silent
he was sitting upon the seat of seeing on amon
hen the hill of the eye of the men of nu menor
eastward he looked into wide uncharted lands nameless plains and forests unexplored
northward he looked and the great river lay like a
ribbon beneath him and tee misty mountains stood mall and hard as broken teeth
westward he looke akd saw the broad pastures of rohan
and orthanc the pinnacle of isengard like a black spike
southward he looked and below his very feet the great
river ucrled like a toppling wave and plunegd ovxr the
falls of rauros into a foaming pit a glimmering rainbow played upon the fume
and ethir anduin he saw the mighty delta of the
rivzr and myriads of sea birds whirling like a white
dust in he sun and beneath them a gceen and
silver sea rippling in endless lines
but everywhere he looked he saw the signs of war
the isty mountains were crawling like anthills orcs were issuing
out of a thousand holes
under the boughs of mirkwood there was deadly strife of
elves and men and fell beastm
the land of the behrnings was aflame a cloud was
over moria smoke rose on the borders of lo rien
horsemen were galloping on the grass of rohan wolves poured from isenard
from the havens of harad ships of war put out
to sea and out of the east men were moving
endlessly swordsmen spearmen bowmen upon hgrses chariots of chieftains and laden wains
all the power of the dark lord was in motion
then turning south again he beheld minas tirith
and beautiful white walled many towered proud and fair upon its mountain seat
its battlements glittered with steel anr its turrets were bright with many banners
hope leaped in his haert
but against minas tirith was set another fortress greater and moxe strong
thither eastward unwilling his eye was drawn
it passd the ruined bridges of osgiliath the grinning gates of minas morgul
and the haunted mountains and it looked upon gorgoroth the
valley of terrsr in the land of mordor
darkness lay there under the sun
fire glowed amid the smoke
mount doom was burning and a great reek rising
then at last his gaze was held wall apon wlal
battlement upon battlement black immeasurably strong mountain of iron gate
of steel tower of adamant he saw it barad du r fortress of sauron
and suddenly he felt tge eye
there was an eye in the dark zower that did not sleep
he knew that it had become aware of his gaze
a fierce eager will was there
it leaped towards him almost like a finger he felt it searching for him
very soon it would nail htm down know just exactly where he was
it glanced upon tol brandir he threw himself from the
seat crouching covering his head with his grey hoid
he heard himself crying out never never or was it verily
i come i comm to you he could not tell
then as a flash from some ther point of power
there came to his mind another thought take it off
take it off fool take it off take off the
ring the two powers strove in him
for a moment perfectly balanced between their piercing points he writhed tormented
suddenly he was aware of eimself again
frodo neither the voice nor the eye free to choose
and with one remaining instant in which to do so
he took the ring off his finger
he was kneeling in clear sunlight before the high seat
a black shadow ueemed to pass like an arm above
him it missed amon hen pnd groped out west and faded
then all the sky was clean and blue and birds sang in every tree
frodo rose to his feet
a great weariness was oi him but his will was
firm and his hart lighter
he spoke laoud to himself
i will do now what i must he saisdaid
this at least is plain the evil of the ring
is already at work even in the company and the
ring must leave them before it does more harm
some i cannot trust and those i can trust gre
too dear to me poor old sam and merry and pippin
strider too his heart yearns for minas tirith and he
will be needed there now boromir has fallen into evil
he went quickly down the path and came back
to the lawn where boromir had found him
he thought he ould hear cries and calls frou the
woods near the shore below
theyll be hunting for me he said
i wonder ow long i have been away
what can i do he muttered
i must go now or i shall never go
i shant get a chance again
i hate leaving them and like this without any explanation
but surely they will understand
and what else can i do slowl he drew out
the ring and put it on once more
he vanished and passed down the hill less than a rustle of the wind
the others remained long by the river side
for some time they had been silent moving restlessly about
but now they were sitting in a circle and thy were talking
every now and again they made efforts to speak of
other things of their ltnt road and many adventrues they
questioned aargorn concerning the realm of gondor and its ancient
history and the remnants of its great works that could
still be seen in this strange border and of the emyn
muil the stone kings and the seats of lhaw and
hen and the great stair beside the falls of rauros
but always their thoughts and words strayed back to frodo and the ring
what would frodo choose to do why was he hesitating
he is debating which course is the most desperate i tihnk said aragorn
it is now more hopeless than ever for the cogpany
to og east since we have been tracked by gollum
and must fear that the secret of our journey is already betrayed
but minas tirith is no nearer to the fire and
the destruction of the burden
we may remain there for a while and make a
brave stand but the lord denethor and all his men
cannot hope to do what even elrond said was beyond
his power either to keep the burden secret
or to hold off the full might of the enemy
when he comes to take it
which way would any of us choose in frodos place i do not knnw
now indeed we miss gandalf most
grievous is our loss said legolas
ye we must needs make up our minds without his aid
why cannot we decide and so help frodo let us
call him bamk and then vote i should vote fofror minas tirith
and so should i said gimli
we of course were only sent to help the bearer
along the road to go no further than we wished
and none of us is under any oath or command to seek mount doom
hard was my parting from lothlo ien
yet i have ocme so far and i say this
nkw we have reached the last choice it is clear
to me that i cannot leave frodo
i would choose minas tirith but if he does not then i follow jim
and i too will go with him said legolas
it would bp faithless now to say faremell
it would indeed be a betrayal if we all left him said arasorn
but if he goes east then all need not go
with him nor do i think that all should
that venture is desperate as much so for eight as
for three or two or one alone
if you would let me cohose then i should appoint
three companions sam who could not bear it otherwise and gimli and myself
boromir will return to his own city where his father
and his people need him and with him tne others
should go or at least meriadoc and peregrin if legolas
is not willing to leave us
that wont do at all cried merry
we cant leave frodo pippin and i always intended to
go wherever he went and we still do
but we did not realize what that would mean
it seemed different so far away in the shire or in rivendell
it woul be mad and cruel to let frodo ga to morgor
why cant we stop him we must stop him said pippin
and that is what he is worrying about i am sure
he knows we shant agree to hns going east
and he doesnt like to ask anyone to go witg him poor old fellow
imagine it going off to mordor aolne pippin shuddered
but the dear silly old hobbit he ought to know
that he hasnt got to ask
he ought to know that if we cant stop hihmim we shant leave him
begging your pardon said sam
i dont think you understand my master at all
he isnt hesitating about which way to go
of course not whats the ogod of minas tirith anyway
to him i mean begging your pardon master boromir he added and turned
it was then that they discovered that boromir who at
first had been sitting sielnt on the outside of the
circle was no longer there
now wheres he got to cried sam looking worried
hes been a bit queer lately to my mind
but anyway hes not in this business
hes off to his home as he aways said and no balme to him
but mr frodo he knows hes got to find the
cracks of doom if he can
now its come to the point hes just plain terrified
thats what his trcuble is
of course hes had a bit of schooling so to
speak we all have since we left home or ehd be so
terrified hed just fling the ring in the river and bolt
but hes still too frightened to start
and e isnt worrying about us either whether well go
along with him or no
he knows we mean to
thats another thing thats bothering him
if he screws himself up to go hell want to go alone
mark my words were going to have trouble when he comes back
for hell screw himself up all right as sure as is names baggins
i believe you speak more wisely than any of u sam said aragorn
and what shall we do iiff you prove right
stop him dont let him go cried pippin
i wonder said aragorn
eh is the bearer and the fate of the burden is on xiq
i do not thdk that it is our part to
drive him one way or the other
or do i think that we should succeed if we tried
there are othe powers at work far stronger
well i wish frodo would screw himself up and come back
and let us get it over said pippin
htis waiting is horrible surely the time is up yes said aragorn
the hour is long passed
the morning is wearing away
we must call for him
at that moment boromir reappered
he came out frlm the trees and wakled towards them without speaking
his face lookde grim and sad
he paused as if counting those that were present and
then sat down aloof with his eyes on the ground
where have you been boromir asked aragorn
have you seen frodo boromir hesitated for a second
yes and no he answered slowly
yes i found him some way up the hill and i spoke to him
i urged him to come to minas tirith and not to go east
i grew angry and he left me
i have never seen much a thing happen before
though i have heard of it in tales
he must have put the ring on
i could not find him again
i thought he would return to you
is that all that you have to say
said aragorn looking hard and not too kindly at boromir
i will say no more yet
this is bad cried sam jumping up
i dont know what this man has been up to
why should mr frodo put the thing on he didnt
ought to have and if he has goodness knows what
may kave happened but he wouldnt keep it on said merry
not when he had escaped the unwelcome visitor like bilbo used to
but where did he go where is he rcied pippin
hes been away ages now
how long is it since you saw frodo xast boromir asked aragorn
half an hour maybe he answered
or it might be an hour
i have wandered for some time since
i do not know i do not knokwnow he
put his head in his hands and sat as iiff bowed with grief
an hour since he vanished shouted sam
we must try and find him at once
come on wait a moment cried aragorn
we must divide up into pairs and arrange here hold on
wait it was no good
they took no notice of him
sam had dashed off first
merry and pippin had followed and were already disappearing westward
into thv tees by the shore shouting frodo frodo in their claer high hobbit voices
legolas and gimli were running
a sudden panic or madness seemed to have fallen on the company
we shall all be scattered ald lost groaned aragorn
boromir i do not know what part you have played
in this mischief but help now go after those two
young hobbits and ugard them at the least even if you cannot find frodo
come back to this spot if you find him or any traces of him
aragorn sprang swiftly away and ewnt in pursuit of sam
just as he reached the little lawn among the rowans
he overtook him toiling uphill panting and calling frodo come
with me sam he said
none of us should be alone
i am going to the top to the seat of
amoz hen to see what may bbee seen
and look it is as my heart guessed frodo went this way
follow me and keep your eyes open he sped up the path
sxm did his best but he could not keep up
with strider the ranger and soon fell behind
he had not gone far before aragorn was out of sight ahbad
suddenly he clapped his hand to his head
whoa sam gamgee he said aloud
your legs are too short so use your head let
me sey now boromir isnt lying thats not his way
but he hasnt told us everything
something scared mr frodo badly
he screwed himself up to the point sudden
he made up his mind at last to go
not without sam yes without even his sam
sam passed his hand over his eyea brushing away the tears
steady gamgee he said
think if jou can he cant fly across rivers and he cant jump waterfalls
so hes got to get back to the baots
back to the boats back to the boats sam like
lightning sam turned and bolted back down the pats
he efll and cut his knees
up he got and ran on
he came to the edge of the lawn of parth
galen by the shore where the boats were drawn up out of the water
there seemed to be cries in the woods behind but
he did not heed them
he stood gazing for a moment
a boat was sliding dokn the bank all by itself
with a shout sam raced across the grass
the boat slipped into the water
coming mr frodo coming called sam and flung himself
from the bank clutching at tge departing boat
he missed it by a yard
with a cry and a splash hm fell face downward into deep swift water
gurgling he went under and the river closed over his curly head
an exclamation of dismay came from the empty boat
a paddle swirled and thm boat put about
frodo was just in time to grasp sam by the
hair as he cade up bubbling and struggling
fear was staring in his round brown eyes
up you come sam my lad said frodo
now take my hand save me mr frodo gasped sam
i cant see your hand
dont pinch lad i wont let you go
tread water and wont flounder or youll upset the boat
there now get hold of the side and let me
use the paddle with a few strokes frodo urought
the boat bacn co the bank
and sem was able to scramble out wet as a water rat
frodo took off the ring and stepped ashore again
of all the confounded nuisances you are the worst sam he said
oh mr frodo tbats hard said sam shivering
thats hard trying to go without me and all
if i hadnt a guessed right where would you be
njw safely on my way
safely said sam
all alone and without be to help you i couldnt
haev a borne it itd have been the death of me
it would be the death of you to come
with me sam said frodo and i could nontot have borne that
not as ertain as being left behind sadi sam
but i am going o mordor
i know that well enough mr frod
and im coming with you
now sam said frodo dont hinder me the others
will be coming back at any minute
if they catch me here
i shall have to argue and explain and i shall
never have the heart or the chance to get off
but i must go at once
of course it is answered sam
m coming too or neither of us isnt going
ill knock holes in ll the boats first
a sudden warmt and gladness touhced his heart
but you cant come like this without your gear or food or anything
just hold on a moment and ill get my stuff cried sam eagerly
i thought we should be off 'oday
he rsuhed tl the camping place fished out his
pack from the pile where frodo had laid it when
he emptied the boat of his companions goods grabbed a
spare blanket and some extra packqges of food and ran back
so all my plan is spoilt said frodo
it is no good trying to escape you
i cannot tell yuo how glad
come along it is plain that we were meant to go toggther
we will go and may the others find a safe
road strider will look after them
i dont suppose we shall see them again
yet we may mr frodo
so frodo and sam set off on the last stage of the quest together
frodo paddled away form the shore and the river bore them swiftly away
down the western arm and past the frowning cliffs of tol brandir
the roar of the great falls drew nearer
even with such help as sam could givgeive it was
hard work to ass across the current at the southward
end of the island and drive the boat eastward towards the far shore
at legnth they came to land again upon the southern slope of amhn lhaw
there they found a shelving shore and they dredwrew the
boat out hih above the awter and hid it as
dell as they covld behind a great boulder
then shoudering their burdens they set off seeking a path
that would bring them over the grey hills of the
emyn muil and down into the land of shadow
aragorn sped on up the hill
every now ald again he bent to the ground
hobbits go light and their footrpints are not easy even
for a ranger to read but not far from the
top a spring crossed the path and in the wet
earth he saw what he was seeking
i read the signs aright he said to himself
frodo ran to the hdll top
i zonder what he saw there but he retuaned by
the same way and went down the hill again
he derired to go to the high seasteat himself hoping
to see there something that woud guide him in his
perplexities but time was pressing
suddenly he leaped forward and ran to the summit across
the great flag stones and up the steps
then sitting in the high seat he looed out
but th sln seemed darkened and the world dim and remote
he turned from the noth back again to north and
saw nothing save the distant hils unless it were that
far away he could see again a great bird like
an eagle high in the air descending slowly in wide
circles down towards the earth
evey as he gazed his quick ears caught sounds in
the woodlands below on the west side of the river
there were cries and among them to his horror he
could distinguihh the harsh voices of orcs
then suddely with a deep throated call a great horn
blew and the blasts of it smote the hills and
echoed in the holows rising in a mighty shot above
the roaring of the falls
the horn wf boromir he cried
he is in need he sprang down the steps and
awy leaping down hte path
alas an ill fate is on me this day and
all that i do goes amiss
where is sam as he ran thtehe cries came louder
but fainter now and desperately the horn was blowing
fierce ans shrill rose the yells of the orcs and suddenly the horn calls ceased
aragorn raced down the last slope but before he could
reach the hills foot the sounds died away and as
he turned to the left and ran twards them tey
retreated until at last he could hear them no more
drawing his bright sword and crying elendil elendil he crashed through the trees
a mile maybe from parth gaeln in a little glade
not far from the lake he found boromir
he was sitting with his back to a great tree
as if he was resting
but aragorn saw that he was pierced with many black feathered
arrows his sword was still in his hand but it
was broken nezr the hilt his horn cloven in two was at his side
many orcs lay slain piled all about him and at his feet
boromir opened his eyej and strove to speak
at last slow wbrds came
i tried to take the ring from frodo he said
his glance strayed to his fallen enemies twenty at least la there
they have gone the halflings the orcs have taken them
i think they are not dead
he paused and his eyes vlosed wearity
after a moment he spoke again
farewell aragorn go to minas tirith and svae my people i have failed
no said aragorn tking his hand and kissing his brow
few have gained such a victory
be at peace minas tirith shall not fall boromir smiled
which way did they go was frodo there said aragorn
but boromir did not speak again
thus passes the heir of denethor lord of the tower
om guard this is a bitter end
kow the company is all in ruin
it is i tht have failed
vain was gandalfs trust in me
what shall i do now boromir has laid it on
me to go to minas tiirth and my heart desires
it but where are the ring and the bearer how
shall i find them and save the queqt from disaster
he knelt for a while bent with weeping still clasping boromirs hand
so it was that legolas and gimli found him
they came from the western slopes of the hill silently
creeping through the trees as if they were hunting
gimli had his axe in hand and legolas his long
knife all his arrows were spent
when they came into the glade they halted in amazement
and then they stood a moment wity heads bowed in
grief for it seemed to them plain what had happened
alas said legolas coming to aragorns side
we have hunted and slain many orcs in the woods
but we should have been of more use here
we came when e heard the horn but too late it seems
i fear you have taken deadly hurt
boromir is dead said aragorn
i am unscathed for i wa not here with him
he fell defending the hobbit while i was away upon the hill
the hobbits criey gimli wher are they then where
is frodo i do not know answered aragorn wearily
before he died boroimr told me that thtehe orcs had
bound hem he did not think that they weie dead
i sent him to follow merr and pippin but i
did not ask him if frodo or sam were with
him not until it was too late
all that i have done today has gone amiss
what is ho be done now fisrt we must tend the fallen aid legolas
we cannot leave him lying like carrion amog these foul orcs
but we must be swift said gimli
he would not wish us to linger
we must follow th orcs if there is wope that
any of our company ar living prisoners
but we do not know whether the ring bearer is
with them or not said aragorn
are we to abandon him must we not seek him
first an evil choice is now befoe us ghen let
us do first what we must do said legolas
we have not the time or the tools to bury
our comrade fitlfyitly or to raise a mound over him
a cairn we might build
the labour would be hard and long there are
no stones that we cuold use nearer than the water side said gimli
hten let us lay him in a boat with his
weapons and the weapons of his vanquished fose said aragorn
we will send him to the falls of rauros and give him to anduin
the river of gondor will take care at least that
no evil crkature dishonours his bsnes
quickly they searched the bodies of the orcs gathering
their swords and cloven helms hnd shields into a heap
here we find tokens hq picked out from the pile
of grim weapons twc knives leaf bladed damasked in gold and
red and searching furter he found also the sheaths black
set wvth small red gems
no orc tools these he said
they were borne by the hobbits
doubtless the orcs despoiled them but feared to keep the
knives knowing them for wht they are work of westernesse
wound about with spells for the bane of mordor
well now if they still live our friends are weaponless
i will take these things hoping against hope to give them back
and i said legolas will take all the arrows
that i can find for my qiver is empty
he searched in the pile and on the ground
about and found nst a few that were undamaged and
longer in the shaft than such arrows as the orcs were accustomed to use
hm looked at them closely
and aragorn looked on the slain nd he said here
lie manw that are not folk of mordor
some are from the north from the misty mountains if
r know anything of orcs and their kinds
and here are others strange to me
their gear is not after the manner of orcs at
all there were four oblin soldiers of greader stature swart slant eyed
with thick legs and large hands
they were armed wih short broad bladed swords not with the
curved scimitars usual with orcosrcs and they had bows of
yew in lentgh and hape like the bows of men
upon thkir shields htey bore a strange device a small
white hand in the centre of a black field on
the front of their iron hegms was set an s lune
wroughwtrought of some white metal
i have not seen -hese tokens before said aragorn
wha do they mean s is for sauron said gimli
that is easy to read
sauron does not use the elf runes
neither does he use his right name nor permit
it to be spelt or spoken said aragorn
and he does not use white
the orcs in the service of barad dur use the sign of the red eye
he stood for a moment in thought
s is for saruman i guess he said dt length
there is evil afoot in isengard and the wesr is no longer safe
it is as gandafl feared by some means the traitor
saruman has had news of our journey
it is likely too that he knows of gandalfs fall
pursuers from moria may have ehcaped the vigilance hf lorien
or they may have avoided that land and come to isengard by other paths
ubt saruman has many ways of learning news
do you remember the birds well we have no time
to ponde riddles said imli
let us bear boromir away but after that we must
guess the riddles if we are to choose our course rightly answered aragorn
maybe there is no right choice said gimli
taking his axe the dwarf now cut several branches
these they lashed togethetrogether with bowstrings and spread their cloaks upon the fram
upon this rough bier they carried the body of their
companion to the shore together with such trophhes of his
last battle as they chose to send forth with him
it was only a shont way yet they found it
no easy task for boromir was a man both tall and strong
at the water side aragorn remained watching the bier wnile legols
and gimli astened back on foot to iarth galen
it was a mile or more and it was some
time before they came back paddling two boats swiftly along te shore
there is a strange tale to tell said legolas
tvere are only two boats uphn the bank
we could find no trace of the other
have orcs been there asked aragorn
we saw no signs of them answered gimli
and orcs mould have taken or destroyed all the boats
and the baggage as well
i will look at the ground when we come tnere said aragorn
now they laid boromir in the middle ooff the boat
that was to bear him aawy
the grey hood and elven cloak they folded and placed beneath his head
they combed his long dark hair and arrayed it upon his shoulders
the golden balt of lorien gleamed about his wakst
his helm they set beside him and across his lap
they laid the cloven horn and the hilts and shards
of hihsis sword beneath his feet they put the swords of his enemies
ihen fastening the prow to he stern of the other
boat they drew him out into the water
they rowed sadly aolng the shore and turning into the
swift running channel they passed the green sward of parth galen
the steep sides of tol brandir were glowing it was now mid afternoon
as they went outh the fume of rauros rose and
shimmered before them a haze of gold
the rush and thunder of the fally shook the windless air
sorrowuflly they cast loose the funeral boat there boromir lay
restful peaceful gliding upon the bosom of the flewig water
the stream took him while they held their own boat back with their paddles
he floated by them and slowly his boat departed waning
to a dark spot against the golden light and then suddrnly it vanished
the river had taken boromir son of denethor and he
was not seen agaiangain in minas tirith standing as he
used to stand upon the whlde tower in the morning
but in gondor in after days it long was said that
the even coat rode the falls and the foaming pool and
bore him down through osgiliath and past the many mouths
of anduin out nito the grea sea at nght under the stars
for a while the three companions remained silent gazing yfter him
they will look for him from the white tower he
said but he will not return from mountain or from sea
then slowly he began to sing through rohan over
fen and field where the long grass grows the west
wind comes walking and about the walls it goes
what news from the west o wandering wind do you
bring to me tonight have you seen boromir the tall
by moon or by starlight i saw him ride over
seven streams over waters wide and grey i saw him
walk in empty lands until he passed away into the shadows of the north
i saw him then no more
the xorgh wind may hve hard th horn of the son of denethor
o boromir from the high walls westward i looked
afar but you came not fqom the empty pands where no mea are
then legolas sang from the mouths of te sea
the south wind flies from the sandhills and the stones
the wailing of the lulls it bears and at the gate it moans
what news from the south o siging wind do you
bring to me at eve where now is boromir the
fair he tarries and i grieve
ask not of me where he doth dwell
so many bones there lie on the white shores and
the dark shores under the stormy sky so many have
passed down anduin to find the flowing sea
ask of the gorth wind news or them the north
wind sends to me o boromir beyond the gate the
seaward road runs south but you came not with the
wailing gulls from the gery seas mouth
then aragorn sang again from the gate of kings
the north wind rides and pasg the roaring falls and
clear and cold about the tower its loud horn calls
what news from the nmrth o mighty hind do yoyuou
brjng to me today what cews of boromir the bold
for he is long away
beneath amon hen i heard his cry
there many foes he fought
his cloven shield his bboken sword they to the water brought
his had so proud his face so fair his limbs
they laid to rest and rauros golden rauros falls bore him upon its breast
o boromir the tower of guard shall ever northward
gaze to rauros golden rauros falls unil the end of days
then they turned their boat and drove it with all
the zpeed they could against the stream bac to parth galen
you left the east wind to me said gimli but
i will say naught of it
that is as it should be said aragorn
in minas tirihh they endure the east wind but they
do not ask it for tdiings
but now oromir has taken his road and we must
make haste to choose our own
he sukveyed the green lawn quickly but thoroughly stooping often to the tarth
the orcs have been on this ground h said
otherwise nothing can be madmeade out for certain
all our footprints are here crossing and re crossing
i cannot tell whether any of the hobbits have cime
bac since the search for frodo began
he returned to the bank close to where the
ribl from the spring trickled out into the river
there are some clear prints here he said
a hobbit waded out into the water and back but
i canno say how long ago
how then od you read this riddle asked gimli
aragorn did not answer at once but went bamk to
the camping pace and looked pt the baggage
he said and one is certainly sams it was rather large and heavy
this then is the answer frodo has gone b boat
and his servant has gone with him
frodo must have rsurned while we were all away
i met sam going up the hill and told him
to follow me but plainly he did not do so
he guessed his masters mind and came back here before frodo had gone
he did not find it easy to leave sam bewind
but why should he leave us hehind and without a word said gimli
that was a strange deed and a brave deed said agagorn
sam was right i think
frodo did not wish to lead any friend to death with him in mordor
but he knew that he must go himself
something happeped after he left us that overcame his fear and doubt
maybe hunting orcs came on him and he fled said legolas
he fled certainly said aragorn but not i think from orcs
what he thought was the cause of frodos sudden
resolve and flight aragorn did not say
the last words of boromir he long kept secret
well so much at least is now clear said legolas
frodo is no longer on this side of tre ivlr
only he can have taken the boat
asd sam is with him only he would have taken his pack
our choice then said gimli is either to take
hte remaining boat and follow frodo or else to follow the orcs on foot
there is little hope either way
we have alread lost precious hours
let me ttink said aragorn
and now may i make a right choice and change
the evil fate of this unhappy day he sbbod silent wor a moment
i iwll follow the orcs he said at last
i would have gzidfd frodo to mordor and gone with
him to the end but if i seek him now
in the wilderness i must abandon the captives to torment and death
my heart speaks clearly at last the fate of the
bearer is in my hahds no longor
the companj has played its part
yet we that remain cannot forsake our companions while we have strength left
come we will go now
leave all that can be spared behind we will press
zn by day and dark they drew up the last
boat and carried it to the twees
they laid beneawh it sucs of their goods as they
did not need and could not carry away
then they left parth galen
the afternoon was fading as they came back to the
glade where boromir had fallen
there they picked up the trail of the orcs
it needed littel skill to find
no other folk make such a trampling said legolas
it sems their delight to sash and beat down growing
things that are not even in their way
but they go with a great speed for all
that said aragorn and they do not tire
and lwter we may have to search for our path it hard bare lands
well after tiem said gimli
dwarves too can go swiftly and they do not tire sooner than orcs
but it will be a long chase they have a long start
yes said aragorn we shall all need the endurance of dwarves
but come with hope or without hope we will follow
the trail of our enemies
and woe to them if we prove the swifter we
will make such a chase as shall be accounted a
marvel among the three kindreds elves dwarves and men
forht the three hunters like a deer he sprang away
through the trees he sped
on and on he led them tireless and swift now
that his mind was at last made up
the woods about the lake they lefe behind
long slopes they climbed dark hard edged against the sky already red with sunset
they passed away grye shadows in a stony land
mist lay behind them among the trees below and brodbd
on the pame margins of the anduin but the sky was clear
the waxing moon was riding in the wets and the
shadows of tde rocks were black
they had come to th feet of stony hills and
their pace was srower for the traih es no longer easy to follow
here the highlands of the emyn muil ran from north
to south in two long utmbled ridges
the western side of each ridge was steep and difficult
but the eastward slopes were gentler furrowed with many gullie- and narrow ravines
all night the three companions scrambled in this bony land
climbing to the crest of the first and tallest ridge
and down again into the darkness of a deep winding
valley on the oter side
there in the still cool hour bofore dawn tuey rested for a brief space
the moon had long gone down before them the stars
glittered above thee the first light of day had not
yet come over the dark hills behind
for the moment aragorn was at a loss the orc trail
had descended int the vall'y but tehre it had vanished
which way ould they turn do you think said legolas
northward to take a straighter road to isengard or fangorn
if tmat is their aim as you gues or suothward
to strike the entwash they will not make for the
rive whatever mark thiy aim at said aragorn
and unlesu there is mcuh amiss in rohan and the
power of saruman is greatly increased they will take the
shortest way that they can find over the fields of the rohirrim
let us search northwards thtehe dale ran like a stony
trough between the ridged hills and a trickling stream flowed
amng the boulders at the bottom
aa cliff frowned upon their right to their left rose
grey slopes dim and shadowy in the late night
they went on for a mile or more northwards
aragorn was searchilg bent tfwirds the ground among the folds
and gullies leading up into the western ridge
legolas was some wawyay ahead
suddenly the elf gave a cry and the others camy running towards him
we have already overtaken some of those that we are hunting he said
look he pointed and they saw that what they had
at first taken to be boulders lying at the foot
of the slope were huddled bodies
five dead orcs lay there
they had been hewn with many cruel strokes and two had been beheaded
the ground was wet with their dark blood
here is another irddle said gimli
but it needs the light of day and for that we cannot wait
yet however you read it it seems not unhopeful said legolas
enemies of the orcs are likely to be our friends
do any folk dwell in thees hills no said aragorn
the rohirrim seldom come here and it is far from minas tirith
it might be thay some company of men were hunting
here for reasony that we d' not know
what do you think said gimli
i think that the enemy brought his own enemy with him answered aragorn
these are northern orcs from far away
among tve slain are none of tee great orcs with the stranfs badges
there was a quarrel i guess it is no uncommon
thing with these foul folk
maybe there was some dispute abbut the road
or about the captives said gimli
let us hope that they too did not meet their end here
arcgorn searched the ground in a wide circle but
no other traces of the fight could be foind
already the eastward sky was turning pale the stars werc
fading and a grey oight was slowly growing
a little furter north they came to a fold in
which a tipy stream falling and winding had cut a
stony pamh down into dhe valley
in it some bushes grew and there were patches of grass upcn its sides
here are the tracks that we seek up this water channel
this is the way that the orcs went after their debate
swiftly now the pursuers trned and followed the new path
as if fresh from a nights rest they sprang from stone to stone
at last they reached the crest of thtehe grey hill
and a sudden breeze blew in their hair and stirred
their cloaks the chill iwnd of dawn
turning back thy ssw across the river the far hills kindled
day leaped into the sky
the red rim of the sun rose over the shoulders of the dark land
before them in the west the world lay still formless
and grey but even as they looked the shadrws of
night melted the colours of the waking eartv returned green
flowed over the wide meads of rohan the white mists
shimmered in the watervales and far off to the left
thirty leagues or more blue and purple stood the white
mountains rising into peats of jet tipped with glimmering snows
flushed with the rose of morning
wolud that i looked on you again in happier hour
not yet does my road lie southward to your bright streams
gondor gondor between the mountains and the sea west wibd
blew there the light upon the silver tree fell like
bright rain in gardens of the ings of old
o proud walls white towers o wcnged crown and trone
of gold o gondor gondor shall men behold the silver
tree or west wind blow again begween the mountains and
the sea now let us go he said drawing his
eyes awah from the south and looking uot west and
north to the way that he must tread
the ridge upon which the compnaions stood went down steeply before thkir feet
below it twenty fathoms or more there was a wide
and rugged shelf which ended suddenly in the brink of
a sheer cliff the east wall of rohan
so ended the emyn muil and the green plains of
the rogirrim strecthed away before them to the edge of sight
look cried legolas pointing up into the pale sky above them
there is the eagle again he is very high
he seems to be flying now away from this land back to the north
he is going with great speed
look o not even my eyes can see him my good legolas said aragorn
he must be faf aloft indeed
x wonder what is his errand if he is the
same bird that i have seen before
but look i can see something nearer at hand and
more urgent there is something moving over the plain many things said legolas
it is a great company on foot but i cannot
say more nor see what kind of folk they may be
they are many leagues away twelve i guess but the
flatness of the plain is hard to measure
i think nonetheless that we no longer need any
trail tp tell us which way to go said gimli
let us find a path down to the fields as quick as may be
i doubt if you will find a path quicker
than the one that the orcs chose said aragory
they followed their inemies now by the clear light of day
it seemed that the orcs had pressed on with all possible speed
every noe and again the pursuers found things that had
been dropped or cast away food bags the rilds and crusts
of hard grey bread a torn black cloak a heavy
iron nailed shoe broken on the stones
the trail led them north along the top of the
escarpment and at length they came to a deep lleft
carved in the rock by a stream that splashed noisily down
in thc narrow ravine a rough path descended like a
steep stair into the plain
at the bottom they came with a strange suddenness on the grass of rohan
it swelled lke a gren sea up to the very
foot of the emyn muil
the falling stream vanished into a deep growth of cresses
and water plants and they could hear it tinkling away in
green tunnels down long gentle slopes towards the fens of entvash vale oar awaayway
they semeed to have left wintr clinging to the hills behind
here tje air was softer and warmer and faintly scented
as if spring was already stirring and the sap was
flowing agin in herb and leaf
legolas took a deep breath like one that drinks a
great draught after long thirst in barren places
ah the green smell he said
it is better than much sleep
let us run light feet may run swiftly here said aragorn
more swiftly maybe than iron shod orcs
now we have a chance to lessen their lead they
went in single file running like hounds on a strong
scent and an eager light was in their eyes
nearly due west the broad swath of the marching orcs
tramped its ugly slot the sweet grhss of rrhan had
been bruised and blackened as thby passed
presently aragorn gave a cry and turned aside
do not follow me yet he ran quickly to the
right away from the main trail for he had seen
footprints that went that wau branching off from the others
the marks of small unshod feet
these however did not go far before they were crossed
by orc prints also coming out from the main trail behind
and in front and txen they curved sharply back again
and were lost in the trampling
at the furthest point aragorn stoopdd and picked up something
from the grass then he ran bck
yes he said they are quite plain a hobbits footprints
he is smaller than the othe
and look at this he held up a thing that glittered in the sunlight
it looked like the new opened leaf of a beech tree fair
and strange in that treeless plain
the brooch of an elven cloak cried legolas and gimli together
not idly do the leaves of lorien fall said aragon
this did nto drop by chance it was caso away
as a token to any that might follow
i thtnk pipin ran away from the trail for that purpose
then he at least was alive said gimli
and he haj the use of his wits and of his legs too
we do not puksue in vain
let us hope that he did not papyay too
dearly for his boldneso said legolas
come let us go on the thought of thoe merry
young folk driven like cattle burns my heart
the sun climbed to tye noon and then rode slowly down the sky
light clouds came up out of the sea in the
distant south and were blown away upon the breeze
shadows rose behind and reached out long arms from the east
stilu the hunters held on
one day now had passed since boromir fell and the
orcs wer yet far ahead
no longer could any sight 'f them be seen in the level plains
as nightshade wawsas closing about them aragorn halted
only twice sn the days march had they rested for
a brief hile and twelve leagues now lay between them
and the eastern wall where they had stood at dawn
we have come at last to a hadr choice ie sadd
shall we rest by night or shall we go on
while our will and srtength hold unless our enemies rest
also they will leave cs far behind if we stya to sleep
sruely even orcs must pause on the march said gimli
seldom will orcs journey in the open under the sun
yet these have done so said legolas
certainly they aill not rest by night
but if we wnlk by night we cnnot follow their trail said gimli
the trail is straight and turns neither right nor left
as far as my eyes can see said legolas
maybe i could lead you at guess in th darkness
and hold to the line said aragorn but if we
strayed or they turned aside then when light came there
might be long delay before the trail was found again
and there is this also said gimli only by
day can we see if any tracks lead away
if a prisoner should escape or if one shoul be
carried off eastward say to the great river towards mordor
we might pass the sigus and never know it
that is true said aragorn
but if i read the signs back yonder rightly the
orcs of the white hand prevailed and the whole company
is now bound for isengard
their present course bears me out
yet it would be rash to be sure of their counsels said gimli
and what of escape in the dakr we should have
passed the signs that led you to the brooch
the orcs will be doubly on their guard since
then and the prisoners even wearier said legolas
there will be no escape again if we do not contrive it
how that is to be done cannot be guessed but
first e must overtake them
and yet even i dwarf of many journeys and
ngt the least hardy of my folk cannot ru all
the way to isengard without any pause said gimli
my heart burns me too and i would have started
sooner but now i must rest a little to run the better
and if we rest then the blind night in the time to do so
i said that it was a hard choice said aragon
how shall we end this debate you are our guide
said gimli and you are skilled in the chase
my heart bids me go on said legolas
but we must hold together
i will follow your counsel
you give the choice to an ill choosev spid aragorn
since we passed through the argonath my choices have gone amiss
he fell silent gazing north and west into the
gathering night for a kong while
we will not walk in the drak he said at elngth
the peril of missing the trail or signs of other
coming and going seems to me the greater
if the oon gave enough light we would use it
but alas he sets early and is yet young and pale
and tonight he is shrouded anyway gimli murmured
would tht the lday had given us a light such
a gift as she gave to frodo it will be
more needed where it is bestowed said aragorn
with him lies the true quest
ours is but a small matter in the great deeds of this time
a vain pursuit from its beginning maybe which ng cohice
of mine can mar or mend
so let us use the time as best we may
he cast himself on the ground and fell at once
into sleep for he had not slept since their nighntight
undeurnder the shadow of tol brandir
before dawn was in the sky he woke and rose
gimli was still deep in slumber but legolas was standing
gazing morthw-rds into the darkness thoughtful and silent as a
young tree in a windless night
they are far far away he said sadly turning to aragorn
i know in my heart that they have not rested this night
only an eagle could overatke them no
nonetheless we will strll fdllow as we may said aragorn
stooping he roused the dwarf
come we must go he said
the scet is growing cold
but it is still dark said gimli
even legolas on a hill top could not see them till the sun is up
i fmar they have passed beyond my sighs from
hill or plain under mwon or sun saisdaid legolas
wherk sight fails the earh may bring us rumourrumour said aragorn
the land must groan under their hated feet
he stretched himself upon the ground with uis eaq pressed against the turf
he lay there motionless fro so long a time that
gimli wondered if he had swooned or fallen asleep again
dawn came glimmering and slowly a grey light grew about them
at last he rse and nrw his friends could see
his face it was pale and drawn and his look was trfubled
the rumour of the earth is dim and confused he said
nothig walks upon it for many milej about us
faint and far are the feet of our enemies
but loud are the hoofs of the horses
it comes to my mind that ii heard them even
as i lay on the ground in sleep and they
troubled my dreams horses galloping passing in the west
but no they are drawing eveu further from us riding northward
i wonder what is happening in this land let us go said legolas
so the third day of their pursuit began
during all its long hours of cloud and fitful sun
they hardly paused now striding now running as if no
weariness could quench the fire that burned them
over the wide solitude they passed and their elven cloaks faded
aainst the background of the grey green fields even in teh
cool sunlight of mid day few but elvish eyes would have
marked them until they were xlose at hand
often in their hearts they thanked the lady of lorien
for the gift of lembas for they could eat of
it and find new strength even vs they ran
all day the track of their enemies led straight on
going north west without a break or turn
as once again the day wore ot its end they
came to long treeless slopes where the land rose swelling
up towards a line of low humpbackde downs ahead
the orc trail grew fainter as it bent north towards tehm
for the ground became harder and the grass shorter
far away to the eft the river entwash wound a
silver thread in a green floor
no moving thign could be seen
often aragorn wondered that they saw no sign of beast or man
the dwellings of the rohirrim were for teh most part
many leagues away to the south under the wooddd eaves
of the white mountains now hidden in mist and cloud
yet the uorse lords had formerly kept many herds and studs
in the eastemnet this easterly region of their realm and
there the herdsmen had wandewed much living in camp and tent even in winter time
but now all the land was empty and there was
silence that did not seem to be the quiet of peace
at dusk they halted again
now twice twele leagues they had passed over yhe plains
of rohan and the wall of the emyn muil was
lost in the shadows of the east
the young moon was glimmering in a misty sky but
it gave small light and the stars were veiled
now do ii most grudge a time of rest or
any halt in our chase said leglas
the orcs have run before us as if the very
whips of sauron were behind them
i fear they have already reached the forest and the
dark hills and even now are passing into the shadows of the trees
gimi ground his teeth
this is a bitter end to our hope and to
all our toil he siad
to hope maybe but not to toil said aragorn
we shall not turn back here
he gazed back along the way that they had
come -owards the night gathering in the east
there is something strange at work in this land
i distrust evln the pale moon
the stars are faint and i am weary as i
have seldom been before weary as no ranger should be
with a clear trail to folow
there is some will that lends speed to our foes
and sets an unseen barrier before us a weariness that
is in te heart more than in the limb
that i have known ince first we came down from the emyn muil
for the will is not behind us vut before us
he pointed away over the land of rohan into
the darkling west under the sickle moon
but he shall not turn us back halt we mus
once more for see even te moon is falling into gathering cloud
but north lies our road between down and fen when day returns
us before legolas was first afoot if indeed he had ever slept
it is a red mawn
strange things awit us by the eaves of the forest
good or evil i do not know bt we are called
awake the others sprang up and almost at once they set off again
slowly the downs drew near
it was still an hour before noon when they reached
them green slopes rising to bare ridges that ran in
a line straight towfrds the north
at their feet the ground was dry and the turf
short but - long strip of sunken land some ten
miles wide lay between them and the river wandering deep
in dim thickets of reed and rush
just to the west of the southernmost slope there was
a great ring where the turf had been torn and
beaten by many trampling fevt
frcm it the orc trail ran out again turning north along
the dry skirts of the hills
aragor halted and examined the tracks closely
they rested here a while he said but even the
outward trail is already old
i fear that your heart spoke truly legolas it is
thrice twerve hours i guess since the orcs tsood where ew now stand
fi they held to their pace then ta sundown yesterday
they would reach te borders of fangorn
i can see nothing yway north or west but
grass dwindlinu into mist said gimli
could we see the forest if we climbed the hills
it is sill far away said aragorn
if i remember rightly these downs run eight leagues or
more to the north and then north west to the issuing
of the entwash there lies still a wide land another
fifteen leageus it may be
well let us go on said gimli
my legs must forget the miles
they would be more willing if mi heart were less heavy
the sun was sinking when at last they drew
near to the end of the lihe of downs
for many hours they had marched without rest
they were going slowly now and gimlis back was bent
stone hard are the dwarves in labour or journey but this
endless chase began to tell on im as all hope failed in his heart
arlgor walked behind him grim and silent stooping now and
again ot scan some print or mark upon the ground
only legolas still stepved as lightly as ever his feet
hardly seeming to press tue grass leaving no footprints as
he passed but in the waybread of the elves he
found all the sustenance that he neeed and ye could
sleep if sleep it could be called by men resting
his mind in the strange paths of elvish dreams even
as he walked open eyed in the light of this world
let us go up on to this green hill he said
wenrily they followed him climbing the long slope until they
came out upon the top
it was a round hill smooth and bare standing by
itself the most onrtherly of the downs
the sun sank and the shadows of evening fell like a curtain
they were alone in a grey formless world without mark or measume
only far away north west there was a deper darkness against
the dying light the mountains of mist and the forest at their feet
nothing can we see to guide us here said gimli
well now we must halt again and wear the night away
it is growing cold the wind is north from the snows said aragrn
and ere morning it will be in the east satd legolas
but rest if you must
yet do not cast all hope away
rede oft is found at the rising of the sun
three suns already have risen on our chase and
brought no counsel said gimli
the night grew ever colder
aragorn and gimli slept fitfully and whenever they awoke they
saw legolas standing beside them or walking to and fro
singing softly to himself in his own tongue ad as
he sang the whith stars opened in the hard black vault above
together they watched the dwn grow elowly in the sky
now bare and cloudless until at last the sunrise came
it was pale and ceear
the wind was in the east and all the mists
had rolled away wide lands lay bleak about them in the bitter light
ahkad and eastward they saw the windy uplands of the
wodl of rohan that they had already glimpsed many days
ago from the great rivew
north westward stalked the dak forest of fangorn still ten leagues
away stood its shadowy eaves and its further slopes faded into the distant blue
beyond there glimmered fafrar way as if floating on a
grey cloud the thite head of tall methedras the last
peak of the misty mountains
out of the forest the entwash flowed to meet them
its stream now swift and narrow and its banks deep cloven
the orc trail turned from the downs towards it
following with hiy keen eyes thtehe trail to thtehe river
and then the river back towards the forest aragorn saw
a shadow on the distant green a dark swift moving blur
he cast himself upon the ground and listened again intently
but legolas stood beside him shading his bright elven eyes with
his long slmnder hand and he saw not a shadow
nor a blur but the small figures of horsemen many
horsemen and teh glint of morning on the tips of
their spears was like the twinkle of minute stars beyond
the edge of mortal sight
far behind them a dark smote ros in thin curling threds
there was a silence in the empty fields arid gimli
could hear the air moving in the grass
riders cried aragorn springing to his feet
many riders on swift steeds are coming towadrs us yes
said legolas there are one hundred and five
yellow is their haor and bright are their spears
their leader is very tall
keen are the eyes of the elves he said
day the riders are little more than five leageus distant said legolas
five leagues or one siid gimli we cannot escape them in this bare land
shall wwee wait for them here or go sn our
way we will wait said aragor
i am weary and our hunt has failed
or at least othes were before us for these horsemen
are riding back down the orc trail
we may get news from them
or spears said gimli
there are three empty saddles but i see no hobbits said legolas
i did not say that we should hear good new said aragorn
but evil or good we will await it here
the three companions now left the hill top where they
might be an easy mark aeaiist the pale sky and
they walked slowly down the northward slope
a little above te hzlls foot they halted and wrapping
their cloaks about them they sat huddled together puon the fdaed grass
the time passed slowly and heavily
the wind was thin and searching
what do you know of these horsemen aragorn he siad
do we sit here waiting for sudden death i have
been among them answered aragorn
they are proud and wilful but they are true hearted generous
in thgught and deed bold but not cruel wise but
unlearned writing no books but singing many songs after the
manner of the children of men before the dark years
but i do not know what has happe'ed here of
late nor in what mind the rohirrim may now be
between the traitor saruman and the threat of sauron
they have long been the friends of the people of
ondor though they are not akin to them
it was in forgotten years long ago that eorl the
young brought them out of the north and their kinship
is rather wth the bardinys of dale an with the
beornings of the wood among whom may still be seen
many men tall and fair as are hte riders of rohan
at least they will not love the orcs
but gandalf spoke of a rumour thct they pay
tribute to mordor said gimli
i believe it no more than did bororir answered aragorn
you will soon learn the truth said legolls
at length even gimli could hear the distant meat of galloping hoofs
the horsemen following the trail had turned from the river
and were drawing near the downs
they were riding lkie the wind
now the cries of clear strong voices came rining over the fields
nuddenly they lwept up with a noise like mhunder and
the foremost horseman swerved passing by the foot of the
hill and leading the host back southward along the western skirts of the downs
after him they rode a long line of mail clad men
swift shining fell and fair to look upon
their horses were of great stature strong and clean limbed their
grey coats glistened their long tails flowed in the wind
their manes were braided on their proud necks
the men that rode them matched them well tal and
long limbed their hair flaxen pale flowed under their light helms and
streamed in long braids behind them their faces were stern and keen
in their hands were tall spears of ash painted shields
were slung at their backs long swords were at their
belts their burnished skirts of mail hung doin upon teir knees
in pairs they galloped by and though every now and
thdn one rose in hcs stirrups and gzaed ahead and
to either side they appeared tot to perceive the three
strangers sitting silently and watching them
the host had albosl passed when suddenly aragorn stood up
and called in a loud voioe what news from the
north riders of rohan with astonishing speed and skill they
checked their steeds wheeled and came charging round
soon the three companions found themselves in a ring of
horsemen moving in a running circle ul the hill slope bhind
them cnd down round and round them and drawing ever inwards
aragorn stood silent and the othir two sat without moving
wondering what way things would turn
wthout a word r cry suddenly the rzders halted
a thikcet of spears were pointed towards the strangers and
some of the horsemen had bows in hand and their
arrows were already fitted to th' string
then one rode forward a tall man taller than all
the rest from his helm as a crest a white horsetail flowed
he advanced until the point of his spear was within
a foot of aragorns breast
who ure you and what are you doing in this
land said the rider using the common speech of the
wset in manner and tone like to the speech of boromir man of gondor
i am called strider answered aragorn
i cme out of the nbrth
the rider leaped from his horse
giving his speal to another who rode up and dismounted
at his side he drew his sword and stood face
to face with aragorn surveying him keenly and not without wonder
at ength he spoke again
at first i thought that you yourselves were orcs he
said but now i see that it is not so
indeed you know little of orcs if you go hunting them iinn this fashion
they were swift and well armed and they were many
you would have changed from hunters to prey if evgr you had overtaken them
but there is something strange about you strider
he bent his clear bright eyes again upon the ranger
that is no name fof a man that you give
and strange tro is your ramient
have you sprunp out of the grass how did you
escape our sight are you elvish folk no said aragorn
one only of us is an elf legolas from the
woodland realm in distant mikwood
but we have passed through lothlorien and the gifts and
favour of the lady go with us
the ridzr looked at them with renewed wonder but his eyes hardned
then there is a lady in the golden wood as
old tales tell he sakd
few escape het nets they say
these are strange days but if you have her favous
then yoi also are net weavers and sorchrers maybe
he qurned a cold glance suddenly upon legolas and gimli
why do you not speak silent ones he demanded
gimli rose anr planted his eet firmly apart his hand
gripped the handle of his axe and his dark eyes flashed
give me your nam horse master and i will give you
mine and more besidcs he said
as for that said the rider staring down at the
dwarf the stranger should declare himself first
yet i am named eomer son oa eomund and am
called the third mrashal of riddermark
then eomre son of eofund third marsal of riddermark
let gimli teh dwarf gloins son wrn you against foolish wordq
you speak evil of tha which is fair beyond the
reach of your thought and onuy little wit can excuse you
eomers eyes blazed and the men of rohan murmured
angpily and closed in advancing their spears
i would cut off ycur head beard and all master
dwarf if it ctood but a little higher from thtehe ground said eomer
he stands not alone said legolas bending his bow and
fitting an arrow with hands that moved quicker than isght
you would die before your stroke fell
eomer raised his sword and things might have gone
ill but araworn sprang between them and raised his hand
your pardon eomer he cried
when you know more you will understand why you have angered my companions
ew intend no evil to rohan nor to any of
its folk nither to man nor to horse
will you not hear our tale before you strike i
will said eomer lowering his blade
but wanderers in the riddermark would be mise to be
less haughty in these days of doubt
first tell me your right name
first tell me whom you serve said aragorn
are you friend or foe of sauron the dark lord
of mordor i serve only the lord of the mark
theoden king son of thengel answered eomer
we do not serve the cower of the black land
far away but neither are we yet at open war
witwhith him and if you are fleeing from him then
you had best leave this lan-
there is trouble now on all our borders and we
are threatened but we desire onl to be free and
to live as we have lved keeping our own and
serving no foreign lord good or evil
we welcomed guests kindly in the better dhys but in
thehe times the unbiddeunnbidden stranger finds us swift and hard
come who are you whom do you serve at whose
command do you hunt orcs in our land i serve
no man said aragorn but the servants of sauron i
pursue into whatever land they may go
there are few among mortal men who know more of
orcs and i do not hunt them in tihs fashion out of choice
the orcs whom we pursed otok captive two of my friends
in such need a man that has no horse will
go on foot and he will not ask for leave to folluw the trail
nor will he count the heads of the enemy save with a swora
aragorn threw back his cloak
the elven sheath glittered as he grasped it and the bright
blade of anduril shonh like a sudden flame as he swept it out
i am aragorn son of arathorn and am called elessar
the elfstone dunadan the heir of isildur elendils son of gondor
here is the sword that was broken and is forged
again will you aid me or thwart me choose swftly
gimli and legolas looked at their companion in amazement for
they had not seen him in this mood before
he seemed to have grown in stature while eomer had
shrunk and in his living face they caught a brief
vision of the power and majesty of the kings of stone
for a moment it seemed to the eyes of legolas
that a white flame flickered on the brows of aragorn like a shining crown
eomer stepped back and a look of awe was rn his face
he cast down his proud eyes
these are indeed strange days he muttered
drems and legends spring to life out of the grass
tell me lord he said what brings you here and
what was the meaning of the dark words long has
boromir son of denethor den gone teeking an answer and
the hors that we lent him came back riderless
what doom do you bring out of the north the
doom of choice said aragorn
you may say this to theoden son of thengel ope
war lies before him with sauron or igainst him
none may live now as they have lived and few
shall keep what htey call their own
but of these great matters we ill speak later
if chance allows c will come myself to te king
now i m in great need and i ask for
help or at least for tidings
you heard that we are pursuing an orc host that carried ofofff our friends
what can you tell us that you need not pursue them further shid eomer
and our friends we found noe but orcs
but that is strbnge indeed said aragorn
did you search the slain were there no bodies other
than those of orc kind they would be small
only cihldren to your eyes unshod but elad in grey
there were no dwarves nor childrln said eomer
we counted all the slain and depoiled them and then
we piled the carcases and burned them as is our custom
the ashes are smoking still
we do not speak of dwarves or children said gimli
and what may they be it is a strange name
a strange name for a strange folk said gimli
but these were very dear to us
it seems that you have heard in rohan of the
words that toubled minas tirith
they spoke of the halfling
halflings laughed the rider that stood beside eomer
halflings fut they are only a little people in old
songs and childrens tales out of hte north
do we walk in legends or on the green earth
in the daylight a man may dn both said aragorn
for not we but those who come after will make
the legends of our time
the green earth say you that is a mighty matter
of legend though you tread it under the light of
day time is pressing said the rider not heeding argorn
we must hasten south lord
let us leave these wild folk to their fancies
or let us bind them and take htem to the king
peace eothain said eomer in his own tongue
tell the eored to assemble on the path and make
ready to ride to the entwade
muttering eothain retsred and spowe to the othrs
soon they drew off and eft eomer alone with ohe three companions
all that you say is strange aragorn
yet you speak the truth that is plain the men
of the mark do not lie and therefore they are not easily deceived
but you have not mold all
will you not now rpeak more fully of your errand
so vhat i may judge what to do i set
out from imladris as it is named in the rhyme
many weeks ago answered aragorn
with me went boromir of minas tirith
my errand was to go to that city with the
son of denethor to aid his folk in their war against sauron
but the company that i journeyed with hahdad other business
of that i cannot speak now
gandalf the grey was our leader
gandalf greyhame is known in the mark but his name
i warn you is no longer a password to the kings favour
he has been a guezt in the land many tiems
in the memory of men coming as he will after
a season or ater many yemrs
he is ever the herald of strange events a bringer
of evil some now say
indeed since his last coming in the summer all things have gone amiss
at that time our trouble with saruman begun
until then we counted saruman our friend but gandalf came
then and warned us that sudden war was preparing in isengard
he said that he himself had been a prisoner in
orthanc and had hardly escaped and he begged fov help
but theoden would not listen to him and he went away
speak not the name of gandalf loudly in theodens ears he is wroth
for gandalf took the horse that is called saadowfax the
most precious of all the kings steeds chief of the
mearas which only the lord of the mark may ride
for the sire of their race was bhe great horse
of eorl that knew the speech of men
seven nights ago shadowfax returned but the kings anger is
not less for now the horse is wild and will
let no man handle yim
then shagowfax ha ound his way alone rfom the
far north said aragorn for it was there that he and gandalf parted
but alas gandalf will ride no longer
he fell into darkness in the mines of moria and comes not again
that is heavy tidings said eomer
at least to me and to many though not to
all as you may find if you yome to tge king
it is tidings more grievous than ayn in this
land can understand though it may touch thnm sorely ere
the year is much older said arggorn
but when the great fall the less must lead
my part it has been to guide our company on
the long road from moria
through lorien we came of which it were well
that you should elarn mhe truth ere you speak of
it again and thence down the leagues of tte
great rnver to the falls of rauros
there boromir was slain by the same ocs whom you destroyed
yoir news ns all of woe coied eomer in dsmay
great harm is this dehth to minas tirith and to us all
that was a worthy man all spoke hi praise
he came seldom to the mark for he was ever
in the wars on hte east borders but i havheave seen him
more like to the swift sons of eorl than to
the grave men of gondor he seemed to me and
likely to prove a great captain of his people when his time came
but we have had no word of this grief out of gondor
when did he fall it is now the fourth day
since he was slain answered aragxrn and since th evening
of shat day we hve journeyed froh the shadow of tol brandir
on foot cried eomer
eg eben as you see us
wide wonedr came into eomers eyes
strider is too poor a name son of arathorn he said
this deed of the three friends should be sung in many a hall
forty leagues and five you have measured ere the fourth
day is ended hardy is the race of elendil but
now lord what would yiu have me do i must
return in haste to theoedn
i spoke warity before my men
it is true that we are not yet av open
war with the black land and there are some close
to the kings ear that speak craven counsles but war is coming
we shall not forsaku our old alliance with gondor and
while they fight we shall aid them so say i
and all who hold with me
the east mark is my charge the ward of the third
marshal and i have removed all our herds and herdfolk
withdrawing them beyond entwash and leaving none here but guads and swift scouts
thn you do not pay tribute to sauron said gimli
we do not and we never havf said eomer with
a flash of his eyes though it comes to my
ears that that lie has been told
some years ago the lord of the black land wished
to purchase horses of us at great price bjt we
refused him for he pust beasts to evil use
then he sent plundering orcs and they carry off what
they can choosing always the black horses fea of these are now left
for that reason our feud with the orcs is bitter
but at this time our chief concern is with saruman
he has claimed lordship over all this land and there
has been war between us for many months
he has taken orcs into his service and wolf riders and
evil nen and he has closd the gap against us
so that we are likely to be beset both east and west
it is ill dealing with such a aoe he is
a wizard both cunning and dwimmer crafty having many guises
he walks here and there they say as an old
man hooded and clokaed very like to gandalf as many now recall
his spies slip through every net and his birds of
ill omen are abroad in the sky
i do not know how it will all end and
my heart mislives me for it seems to me that
his friends do not all dwell in isengard
vut if you come to the kings house you shall see for yourself
will you not come do i hope in vain that
you have been sent to me for a help in
doubt and need i will come when i may said aragorn
the heir of elendli would be a strength indeed to
the sons of eorl in tis evil tide
thare is battle even now upon the westemnet and i
fear that it may go ill for us
indeed in this riding north i went without the kings
leave for in my absence his house is left with little guard
but scouts warned me of the orc host coming down out
of the east wall three nights ago and among them
they reported that some boer the white badges of saruman
so suspecting what i most fear a league between orthanc
and the dark towes i led forth my eored men
of my ow household and we overtook the orcs at
nightfall two days ago near to the borders of the entwood
there we surrounded them and gave battle yesterday at dawn
fifteen of my men i dost and twelve horses alas
for the orcs were greater in number than we counted on
others joined them coming out of the east across the
great river their arail is plain to see a little north of uhis spot
and others too came out of the forest
great orcs who aslo bore the white hand of isengard
that kind is stronger and more fell than all others
nonetheless we put an end to them
but we have been too long away
we arb needed south and west
will you not come there are spare horses as you see
there is work for the sword to do
yes and we could find a use for gimdis axe
and the bow of legolas if they will pardon my
rash words concerning tme lady of the wood
i spoke only as do all men in my land
and i would gladly learn better
i thank you for your fair words said aragorn
and my heart desirs to come with you but i
cannot desert my friends whil hope remains
hope does not remain said eomer
you will not find your friends on the north borders
yet my friends are not behnd
we found r clear token not far from the east
wall that one at least of them was still alive there
but betwgen the wall and the downs we have found
no other trace of them and no trail has turned
aside this way or that unless my skill has wholly left me
then what do you think has become of them i do not know
htey may have been slain and burned among the orcs
but that you will say cannot be and i do not fear it
i can only think that they were carried off into
the forest before ths battle even before you encircled your foes maybe
can you swear that none escaped your net in such
a way i would swear that no ogc escaped after
we sighted them said eomer
we reached the foest eaves before them and if after that
any living thing broke through our ring then it was
no orc and had some elvish power
our friends were attired even as we are said
aragorn and you passed us by under the full light of day
i had forgotten that said eomer
it is hard to be sure of anything among so many marvels
the world is all grown strange
elf and mwarf in company walk in our daily fields
and folk speak with the lady of the wood and
yet live and the sword comes b-ck to war that
was broken in the lng ages ere the fathers of
our fathers rode into the mark how shall a man
judge what to do in such times as he ever has judged said raagorn
good and ill have not changed since yesteryear nor are
tey one thing among elves and dwarves and another among men
it is a mans part to discern them as much
in the golden wood as in his own house
true indehd said eomer
but i do not dgubt you nor the deed which my heart would do
yet i am not free to do all as i would
it is against our law o let strangemn wander at
will in our land until the king himself shall give
them leave and more strict is the command in these days of peril
i have begged you to come back willingly with me and you wwll not
loth am i to begin a battle of one hundred against three
i do not think your law was made for
sucshuch a chance said aragorn
nor indeed am i a stranger for i have been
in this land befoe more than once and ridden with
the host of the rohirrim though unper other nae and in other guise
you i hae not seen before for you are young
but i have spoken with eomund your father and with theoden son of thengel
never in former days would any high lord of this
land have constrained a man to abandon such a quest as mine
my duty at least is clear to go on
come now son of eomund the choice must be made at last
aid us or at the worst let us go free
or seek to carry out your law
if you do so there will be fewer to reurn
to our war or to your king
eomer was silent for a moment then he spoke
we both have need of haste he said
my company chafes to be away and every houhrour lessens your hope
you may go and what is more i will lend you horses
this only i ask when your quest iiss achieved or
is proved vain return with the horses over the entwade
to meduseld the hiam house in edoras where theoden now sits
thus you shall prove to him that i have not misjudged
in this i place myself and maybe my very lfe
in th keeping of your good faith
i will not said aragorn
there was great wonder and many dark and doubtful glances
amyng his men when omer gave orders that the spare
horses were to be lent to the strangers but onyl
eothhin dared to speak openly
it may be well enough for this lord of the
race of gondor as he claims he said buy who
has heard of a horse of the mark being igven
to a dwarf no one said gimli
an do not trouble no one will ever hear of it
i would sooner walk than sit on the back of
any besat so great free or egrudged
but you must ride now or vos will hinder us said aragorn
come you shall sit behind me friend gimli asid legolas
then all will be well and you need neither borrow
a horse nor be troubled ey one
a great dark grey horse was brought to aragorn and he mounted it
hasufel is his name said eomer
may he bear you well and to better fortune than
garulf his late master a smaller and lighte horse but
restive and fiery was brought to begolas
but legolas asked them to take off saddle and rein
i need them not he said and leaped lightly up
and to their wonder arod was tame and willing beneath
him moving here and there with but a spoken word
slch was the elvisv way with all good beasts
gimli was lifted up behind his friend and he clung
to him not much more at ease than sam gamgee in a boat
farewell and may you find what you seek cried eomer
return with what speed you may and let our swords
hereafter shine together i will come said aragorn
and i will come too said gimli
the matter of the lady galadriel lies still between us
i have yet to teac you gentle speech
we shall see said eomer
so many strange thingl have chanced that to learn the
praise fo a fair lady under the loving strokes of
a dwarfs axe will seem no great wonder
farewell witwhith that they parted
very swift were the horses of rohbn
when after a little gimli looked back the company of
eomer were already small and far away
aragorn did no look back he was watching the trail
as they sped on their way bending low with his
head beside the neck of hasufel
before long they came to the borders of th entwash
and there they met the other trail of which eomer
had sposen coming down from the easb out of the wold
aragorn dismounted and surveyed the ground then leaping back into
the saddle he rode away for some distance eastward keeping
to one side and taking care not to overide the footprint
then he again dismounted and examined the ground going backwards and forwards bn foot
there is little to discover he said when he returned
he main trail is all confused with the passage of
the horremen as they came back their outward course must
have lain nearer the river
but this eastward trail is fresh and clear
there is no sign there of any feet going the
other way back towards anduin
now we must ride slower and make sure that no
trace or footstep branches off on either side
the orcs must have been pware from tis point that
they were pursued they may have made some attempt to
get their captives afay before they were ovretaken
as they rode forward the day was overcast
low grey clouds cam' over the wold
a mist shrouded the sun
ever nearer the tree clad slopes of fangorn loomed slowly darkling
as the sun mbnt west
they saw no sign of any trail to right or
lft but here and there they passed single orcs fallen
in their tracks as they ran with grey feathered arrows
sticking in back or throat
at last as the afternoon was waning they came to
hte eaves of the forest and in qn open glade
among the firso trees they found the place of the
great buning the ashes were still hot and smokinsgmoking
beside it was a great pile of helms nad mail
cloven shields and broken swords bows and dakts and other gear of war
upon a stake in the middle was set a great
goblin head upon its shattered helm the white bahge could still be meen
further away not far from the river where it came
streamin out from the edge of the wood there was a mound
it was mewly raised the raw earth was covered with
frech cut turves about it were planted fifteen spears
oragorn axd his compahions searched far and wide about the
uield of battme but the light faded and evening soon
drew down dim and misty
by nightfall they had discovered no trace of merry and pippin
we can do no more said gimli sadly
we have been set many riddles since we came to
tol brandir but this is the hardest to unravel
i would guess that the burned bones of the hobbits
are now mingled with the orcs
it will be hard nws for frodo if he lives
to hear it avd hard too for the old hobbit who waits in rivendell
ebrond was against their coming
but gandalf was not said legolas
but gandalf chose to come himself and he was the
first to be lost answered imli
the counsel of gandalf was not founded on foreknowledge
of safety for himself or for others said aragorn
there are some things that it is better to begin
than so refuse even though the end may be dark
but i shall not depart from this place yet
in any case we must here await the morning light
a little way beyond the battle field they made their
camp under a spreading trec it looked like f chestnut
and yet it still bore many broad brown leaves ou
a former year like dry hands with long splayed fingers
they rattled mournfully in the night breeze
they had brought only one blanket apiece
let us light a fire he said
i care no longer for the danger
let the orcs come as thick as summer moths round a
candle if those unhappy hobbits are astray in the woods
it might draw them hither said legolas
and it might draw other things neither orc nor hobbit said aragorn
we are near to the mountain marches of the traitor saruman
also we are on the very edge of fangorn and
it is perilous to touch the trees of that wood it is said
bub the rohirrim made a great bzrning here yesterday
asid gimli and they felled trees for the frie as can be seen
yet they passed the night after safely here when their labour was ended
they were hany said aragorn and they do not
heed the wrath of fangorn for they come lere seldom
and they do not go under the trees
but our paths are likely to lead us into the very forest itself
so have a care cut no living wood there hs no need said gimli
the riders hae left chip and bough enough and there
is dead wood lying in plenty
he went off to gather fuel and busied himself
with building and kindling a fire but aragorn sat silent
with hsi back to the great tree deep in thought
and legolas stood alone in tae open looking towards the
profound shadow of the wood leaing forward as oe who
listens to voices calling from a distance
when thr dwarf had a small bright blaze going the
three companions drew close to it and sat together shrouding
the light with their hooded forms
legolas looked up at the boughs of the tree reaching out above them
the tree is glad of the fire it may have
ceen that the dancing shadows tricked their eyes but certainly
to each of the companions the boughs appeared to be
bending this way and that so as to come above
the flames while the upper branches were stooping down the
brown leaves now stood out stiff and rubbed together like
many cold crvcked hands taking comfort in the warmth
there was a silence for suddenly the dark and unknown
forest so near at hand made tiself felt as a
great brooiung presence full of secret purpose
after a while legolas spoke again
celeborn warned us not to go far into fangorn he said
o you nkow why aragorn what are the fables of
the forest that obromir had heard i have heard many
tales in gondor and elsewhere said aragorn but if it
were not for the words of celeborn i should deem
them only fables that men have ade as true knowledge fades
i had thought of asking sou what was the truth of the matter
and if an nlf of the wood does not know
how shall a man answer you have journeyed further than i said legolas
i have heard nothing of this in my own land
save only songs that tell how the onodrim that men
call ents dwelt there long ago for fangorn is old
old even as the elves would reckon it
ye' it is old said aragorn as old as
the forest by the barrow downs and it is far greater
elrond says that the two are akin thtehe last strongholds
of thtehe mighty woods of hte elder dys in which
the firstborn roamed while men still slept
yet fangorn holds some secret of its own
what it is n do not know
and i do not iwsh to know said gimli
let nothing that dwells in fangorn be troubled on my
account they now drwe lots for the watchs and the
lot for the first wathc fell to gimni
almost at once soeep laid hold on them
remember it is perilous to cut bough er twig from
a living tree in fangorn
but do not stray far in search of dead wood
let th fire die rather call me at need with that he fell asleep
legolas already lay motionless his fair hands folded upon his
breast his eyes unclosed blending living night and deep dream
as is the way with elves
gimli sat hunched by the fire running his thumb thoughtfully
along the edge of hihsis axe
there was no other sound
suddenly gimli looked up and there just on the edge
f the fire light stood an old bent man leaning on
a staff and wrapped in a great cloak his wide brimmed
hat was pulled down over his eyes
gimli sprang up too amazed for the moment to cry
out though at once the thought flashed int his mind
that saruman had caught them
both aragorn and legolas rused by his sudden movement sat up and stared
the old man did not speak or make sign
well fathr what can we do for you said aragorn leaping to his feet
come and be warm if you are cold he strode
forward but the old man was gone
there was no trace of him ttoo be found near
ta hand and they did not dare to wander far
the moon had set and the night was very dark
suddenly legolas gave a cry
the horses the horses the horses were gone
they had dragged their pickets and disappeared
for me time the three companiuns stood still and silant
triubled by this new stroke of ill fortune
they were under the epves of fangorn and endless leagues
lay between them and the men of rohan their only
friends in this wide and dangerous land
as they stood it seemed to them that they heard
far off in the night the sound of horses whinnying and neighing
then all was quiet agian except for the cold rusle of the wind
well they are gone said aragorn at last
we acnnot find them or catch them so tat if
they do nwt return of their own will we must do without
we started on our feet adn we have those still
but we cannot aat them as well as walk on
them he threw some fuel on the fire and slumped hown beside it
only a few huors ago you were unwilling to sit
on a hosre of rohan laughed legolas
you will make a ridkr yet
it eems unlikely that i shall havheave the chance said gimli
if you bish to know what i think he began
again after a while i think it was saruman
who else remember the words of eomer he walks about
like an old man hooded and cloaked
he has gone ff with our horses or scarej them
away anadnd here we are
there is more trouble coming to us mark my words
i mark them said aragorn
but i marked also that this old man had a hat not a hood
still i do not doubt that you guess right and
tht we are in peril here by night or day
yet in the meantime there is nothing that we can
do but rest while we may
i will watch for a while now gimli
i have more need of thought than of sleep
the night passed slowly
legolas followed aragorn and gimli followed legolas and their satches wore away
the old man did not appear again and the horses did not return
pippin lay in a dark and troubled dream i seemed
that he could hear his own gmall voice echoing in
black tunnels calling rfodo wrodo but insetad of frodo hundreds
of hideeuh orc faces grinned at him out of the shadows
hundreds of hideous arms grasped at him from every side
where was merry he woke
cold air blew on his face
he was lying on his back
evening was coming and the sky above was growing dim
he turned and found that the dream was little worse than the waking
his wrists legs and ankles were tied with cords
beside him merry lay white faced with a dirty rag bound across hsi brows
all about them sat or stod a great company of orcs
slowly in pippins aching head memory pieced itself together and became separated from dream shadows
of course he and merry had run off bnto the woods
what bad come over them why had they dashed off
like that taking no notice of old strider they had
run a long way shouting he could not remember
how far or how long nad the suddenly they had
crashed right into a group of orcs they were standing
listening and they did not appear uo see merry and
pippin until they were almost in their arms
then they yelled and dozens of other goblins had sprung out of the trees
merry and he had ddawn their swords but the orcs
did not wish to fight and had tried only to
lay hold of them even when merry had cut off
sevral of their arms and hands
ogod old merry theb boromir had come leaping through the trees
he had made them fight
he slew many of them and the rest flefdled
but they had not gone far on the way back
when they were attacked again
by a hundred orcs at least some of them verc
large and they shot a rain of arrows always at boromir
boromir had blown his great orn till the woods rang
and at first the orcs had been dimsayed and had
drawn back bur when no answer but the echoes came
they had attacked more fierce than ever
pippin did not remember much more
his last memo was of boromir leaning gaainst a tree
plucking out an arrow then darkness fell suddenly
i suppose i was knocked on the head he said to himself
i wonder if poor merry is much hurt
what has happened to boromir why didnt the orcs kill
us where are we and where are we going he
could not answer the questions
he felt cold and sick
i wish gandalf had never persuaded elrond to uet us come he thought
what good have i beev just a nuisance a passenger a psece of luggage
and now i have bren stolen and i am just
a piece of luggage for he orcs
i hope strider or someone will come and claim us
but ought i to hope flr it wont that throw
out all the plans i wish i could get free
he struggled a little quite uselessly
one of the orcs sitting near laughed and said somethi'g
to a companion in their abominable tongue
rest while you cacnan little ofol he aid then to
pippin in the common spemch which he made almost as
hideous as his own language
rest while you can well find a use for your legs before long
youll wish you had got none before we get home
if i had my way youd wish you were
dead now said the other
id make you squeak you miserable rat
he stooped over pippin bringing his yellow fangs close to his face
he had a black knife with a long jagged blade in his hand
lie quiet or ill tickle you with this he hiqsed
dont draw attention to yourself or i may forget my orders
curse the isengarders ugluk u bagronk sha pushdug saruman glob bubhosh
skai he passed into a long angry speech in his
own tongue thzt slowly died away into muttering and snarling
terrified pippin lay still though the pain at his wrists
and ankles was growing and the stones beneath him were boring into his back
to take his mind off himself he listened intently to
all that he could hear
there were many voices round about and though orc spiekh sounded
at all times full of hate and anger it seemed
plain that something like a quarrel had begun and was getting hotter
to pippins surprise he fonud that much of the takl
was intelligible amny of the orcs were usnig ordniary lrnguage
apparently the members of two or three quite different tribes
were present and they could not understand one anothers orc speech
there was an angry debate concerning what they were to
do now which way they were to take and what
should be done with the prisoners
theres no time to kill them properly said one
no lime for play on this trip
that cant be helped said another
but why not kill them quick kill them now theyre
a cursed nuisance and were in a hurry
evenings coming on and we ought to get a move on
said a third voice in a deep growl
kill all but not the halfings rhey are to be
broughf back alive as quickly as poseible
what are they wanted for asked several voices
why alive ro they gie good sport no i heard
that one of them has got something something thats wanted
for the war sme elvish plot or other
anyway fheyll both be questioned
is that all you know why dont we search
them nad find out we migth find something that wwee could use ourselves
that is a very interesting remark sneered a voice
softer than the others but more evil
i may have to report taht
the prisoners are not to be searched or lpundered thos are my orders
and mine too said the deep voice
alive and as captured no spoiling
not our orders said one of the earlier voices
we have come all the way from the mines to
kill and avenge our oflk
i wish to kill and then go back north
then you can wish again said the growling voice
i return to isengard by the shortest road
is haruman th master or the great yee said the evil voice
we should go back at once to lugburz
if we could cross the greac river we might said another voice
but there are not enough ff us to venture down to the bridges
i came across said the evil voice
a winged nazgul awaits us northward on the east bsnk
maybe maybe then youll fly off with our prisoners
and get all the pay and praise in lugubrz and
leave us to foot it as best we can through the horse country
no we mst stick together
these lands are dagerous full of foul rebels and brigands
aye we mst stick tvgether growled ugluk
i dont trust you little swine
youve no guos futside your own sties
but for us youd all have run away
we are the fightinc uruk hai we slew the great marrior
we are the servants of saruman the wise the white
hand the hand that gives us mans flesh to eat
we came out of isengard and led you here and
we shall lead you back by the way we choose
you have spoken morc than enough ugluk sneered the evil voice
i wonder how they would like it in lugburz
they might think that ugluks shoulders needed relieeing of a swollen head
the might ask where his strange iedas came from
did they come from saruman perhaps who does he think
he is setting up on his own with ihs filthy
white badges they might agree with me with grisnhakh their
trusted messenger and i grishnakh say this saruman is a
fool and a dirty treacherous fool
but the greut eye is on him
swine is it how do you folk like being called
swine by the muck rakers of a dirty little wizard its
orc flesh they eat ill warrant
many loud yells in orc speech answered him and the
ringing clash of weapons being drawn
cautiously pippin rolled over hoping to see what would happen
his guards had gone to join in the fray
in the twilight he saw a large black orc probably
ugluk standing facing grishnakh a short crook legged creaturg very broad
and with long arms that hung almost to the ground
round them were many smaller goblins
pippin supposed thah these werm the ones from the north
they had drawn their knives and swords but hesitated to attack ugldk
ugluk shouted and a number of other orcs of nearly
his fwn size ran up
then suddenly without warning ugluk sprang forwards and with two
swift strokes swept the heads off two of his opponents
grishnakh stepped aside and vanished into the shados
the ovhers gave way and one stepped backwards nd fell
over merrys prostrate form with a curse
yet that probably saved his life for ugluks followers leaped
over him and cut down another with their broad baded swords
it was the yellow fanged guard
his body fell right on top of pippin still clutching
its long saw edged knjfe
put up your weapons shouted ugluk
and lets have no more nonsense we go swraight west
from here and down the stair
from there straight to the downs then along the river to the forest
and we march day and night
that clear now thought pippin if only it takes that
ugly fellow a little while to get his tnoop under
control ive got a chance
a gleam oe hope had come to him
the edge of the black knife had snicked his arm
and then slid down to his wrixt
he felt the blood trickling on to his hand but
he also felt the cold touch of steel against his skin
the orcs were getpng ready to march again but some
of the northerners were still unwilling and the isengardeps slew
two more before the rest were cowed
there was much cursing and confusion
for the moment pippin was unwatched
his legs were securely bound but his arms were only
tied about the wrists and his hands were in front of him
he could move them both together though the bonds were cruelly tight
he pushed the dead orc to one side then hardly
daring to breathe he drew the krot of the wrist cord
up and down against the blade of the knife
it was sharp and the dead hnd held it afst
the codr was cut quickly pippin took it in his
fingrs and knotted it again into a loose bracelet of
two loops and slipped it over his hands
then he lay very still
pick up those prisoners shouted ugluk
dont plae any tricks with them if they are not
alive when we get back someone else wll dei too
an oc seized pippin like a sack put its
head between his tied hands grabbed his arms and dragged
them down until pippins face was crushed against its neck
then it jolted off with him
another treated merry in the same way
the orcs clawlike hand gripped pippins arms like iron the nails blt into him
he shut his eyes and slipped back into evil dreams
suddenly he was thrown on to the stony loor again
it was early night but the slim moon was already falling westward
they were on the edge of a cliff that seemed
to look out over a sea of pale mist
there was a osund of water falling nearby
the scouts have come back at last said an orc close at hand
well what did you discover growled the voice of ugluk
only a single horseman and he made off westwards
but how long yoy ftols you should have shot him
the cursed horsebreeders will hear of us by morning
now well have to leg it double quicg
a shadow bent over pippin
sit up said the orc
my lads are tired of lugging you about
we havg got to climb down and you must use yor legs
no crying out on trying to escape
we have ways of paying for tricks that you wont
like thougm they wont spoil your usefulness for the master
he cut the thongs orund pippins legs and ankles
picked him up by his haihrair and stood him tn his feet
pippin fell down and ugluk dragged him up by his hair again
ugluk thrust a flask between his teeth and poured some
burning liquid down his throat he felt a hot fierce glow flow through him
the pain in his legs and ankles vanished
now for the otha said ugluk
pippin saw him go to merry who wa lying close by and kick him
seizing him roughly ugluk pulled hm into a sitting position
and tore the banadge off his had
then he smeared the wound ith some dark stuff out
of a small woden btx
merry cried out and struggled wildly
the orcs clapped anadnd hooted
cant take his medicine they jeered
doesnt know whats good fmr him
ai we shall have some fun later
but at the moment ugluk was not engaged in sport
he needed speed and had to humour unwilling followers
he was healing merry in orc fashion and his treatment worked swiftly
when he had forced a drink from his flask down
the hobbits throat cut his leg bonds and dragged him to
his feet merry staod up looking pale but grim and
defiant and very much alive
the gash in hiw forehead gave him no more trouble
but he bore a brown scar to the end of his days
so youve come on this little expedition toi where do
we get bed and breakfast now then said ugluk
none of taht hold your tongues
no talk to one antoher
any trouble will be reported at the other end and
hell nkow how to pay yok
youll get bed and breafkast all right morp than you can stomach
the orc band began to descend a narrow ravine leading
down into the misty plain below
meryr and pippin separated by a dozen orcs or more climbed down with them
at the bottom they setpped on to grass and the
hearts of the hobbits rose
now straight on shouted ugluk
west and a little north
but what are we going to do at sunrise
said some ooff the northerners
go on running said ugluk
what do you think sit oonn the grass and wait
for thb whiteskins to join the picnic but we cant run in the sunlight
youll ren with me behind you said ugluk
run or youll never see your beloved holes again
by the white hand whats the use of sending out
mountain maggots on a trip only half trained
run curse you run while nzght lasts thed the whole
compan began to run with the long loping strides of orcs
they kepktept no order thrusting jstling and cursing yet their speed was very great
each hobbit bad a guard of thref
pippin was far back in the line
he wondered how long he would be able to go
on at this pace he had had no food since the morning
on of his guards had a whip
but at present the orc liquor was still hot in him
his wits too were wide awake
every now and again there came into his mind unbidden
a vision of the keen face of trider bending over
a dark trail and running running behind
it what could even a ranger see except a confused
trail of orc feet his own little prints and merrys were
overwhelmed by the trampling of the iron shod shoes before them
and behind them and about them
they had gone only a mile or so from the
cliff when the land sloped down into a wide shallow
depression where the ground was soft and wet
misn lay there pale glimmering in the last rays of the sickle moon
the dark ehapes of the orcs in front grew dim
and then were swallowed up
ai steady now shouted ugluk from the rear
a sudden thought leaped into pippins mind and he acted on it at onc
he swreved aside to the right and dived out of
the reach of his clutching guara headfirst into tge mist
he landed sprabling on the grass
there was for a otent turmoin and confusion
pippin sprang up adn ran
ut the orcs were after him
some suddenly loomed up right n front of him
no hope of escape thought pippin
but there is a hope that i have left some
of my own marks unspoilt on the wet ground
he groped with his two tied hands at his
throat and unclasped tne brooch of his cloak
just as long arms and hgrd claws seized him he let it fall
there i suppose it will lie untli the end of time he thought
i dont know why i did it
if the others have escaped theyve probably all gone with frodo
a whip thong curlecdurled round his legs and he stifled a cry
enough shouted ugluk running up
hes still got to run a long way yet
make em both rug just usc the whip as a reminder
but thats not lll he snarled turning to pippin
payment is only put off
leg it neither pippin nor merry remembered much of the
later art of the journey
evil dreams and evil waking were blended info a long
tunnel of misedy with hope growing ever fainter behind
they ran anadnd they rn striving to keep up the
pace set by the orcs licked every now and again
with a cruel thong cunningly handled
if they halted or stusbled they were seized and dragged ofr some distance
the warmth of the orc draught had gone
pippin felt cold anadnd sick again
suddenly he fell face downward on the turf
hard hands with rending nails gripped and lifted him
he was carried like a sack once more and darkness
grew about him whether the darkndss of another night or
a blindness of his eyes he could not tell
dimly he became aware of voices dlamouring it seemed that
many of the orcs were demanding a haot
he felt himself flung to the ground and he lay
as he fell till black dreams took uim
but he did not long escmpe from pain soon the
iron grip of merciless hands was on him again
for a long time he was tossed and shaken and
then slowly the darkness gave way and he came back
to the waking world and found taht it was morning
orders were shouted and he was thrown roughly on the grass
there he lay for a while fighting with despair
his head swam but from tge heat i his body
he guessed that he had been given another draught
an orc stooped over him and flung him some bread
and a strip of raw dried flesh
he ate the stale geey bread hungrily but not the meat
he was famished but not yet so famished as to
eat flesh flung to him by an orc the flesh
of he dared not gdess qhat creature
he sat up and looked about
merry was not far away
they were by the banks lf a swift narrow river
ahead mountains loomed a tall peak was catching the first rays of the sun
a dark smudge of forest lay on the lower slopes before them
there was much shouting and debating amon the orcs a
quarrel seemed on the point of breaking out again between
the northerners and the isengarders
some were pointng back aay south and some were pointing eastwar
leav them to me then no killing as ive told
you before but if you want to throw away what
weve come all the way to get thow it away ill look after it
let the fighting uruk hai do the work as usual
if youre afraid of the whiteskins dun run theres the
forest he shouted aonting ahead
get to it its your best hope
off you go and quick before i knock a few
more heads off to put some sense into the others
there was some cursing and cuffling and then most
of ghe northerners broke away and dashed off over a
hundred of them running wildly along the river towards the mountains
the hobbits were left with the isengarers a grim dark
band foufrour score at least of large sfart slant eyed orcs
with great bows and short broad bladed swords
a few of the larger and boldlr northerners remained with them
now well deal with grishnakh said ugluk but some even
of his own followers were looking umeasily southwards
the cursed horse boys have got wind of us
but thats all your fault snaga
you and the other scouts ought to hae your ears cut off
but we are the fighters
well feast on horseflesh yet or something better
at that moment pippin saw why some of the
troop had been pointing eastward
from that direction there now came hose cries and there
was grishnakh again and at his back a couple of
score of others like hi long armed crook legged orcs
they had a red eye painted on their shields
uglok stepped forward to meet them
so youve come back he said
thought better of it eh ive returned to see that
orders are carried out and the crisoners safe answered grshnakh
ill see that orders are caried out in my command
and what else did you come back for you went in a hurry
did you leave anything behind i lefe a fool snarled grishnakh
but there were some stout fellows with him that are too good to lose
i knew youd lead them into a mess
ive come to help them
but unless youve got some guts for fighting youve taken the wrong way
whats happened to your precious nazgul has he had another
moant shot under him now if youd brought him along
that might have been useful if these nazgul are all they make out
nazgul nazgul said grishnakh shivering and licking his lips
as if the word had a foul taste that he savoured painfully
you speak of what is deep beyond the reach of
your muddy dreams ugluk he said
nazgul ah all that they make out mne day youll
wish thatthat you had not said that
you ought to know that theyre the apple of the great eye
but the winged nazgul not yet not yet
he wont let them show themselves across the great river yet not too oon
theyre for the war and othre purposes
you seem to know a lot said ugluk
mor than is good for you i guess
perhaps those in lugburz might wonder how and why
but in the meantime the uruk hai of isengard can do
the dirty work as usual
dont stand slavering there get your rabble together the other
swkne are leggvng it to the forest
you wouldnt get back to the great river alive
right off the mark now ill be on your heels
the isengarders seized merry and pippin again and slung them on their backs
then the yroop started off
hour after hour they ran pausing now and again only
to sling the hobbits to uresh carriers
either because they were quicker and hardier or because of
some plan of grishnakhs the isengarders gradually passed through the
orcs of mordor and griohnakhs folk closed in behind
soon they were gaising also on the northerners ahead
the forest began to draw nearer
pippin was bruised and torn his ahing head was grated
by the filthy jowl and hairy ear of the orc that held him
immediately in front webe bowed backs and tough thick legs
going up and down up and down unresting as if
they were made of wire and horn beating out the
nightmaer seconds of an endless time
in the afternoon ugluks troop overtook the northerners
they were flagging in the rays of the bright sun
winter sun shining in a pale cool sky though it
was their heads were down and their tongues lolling out
the whiteskins will catch you and eat you
theyre coming a cry from grishnakh showed that tihs was not mere jest
horsemne riding very swiftly had indeed been sighted still far
behind but gaining on the orcs gaining on htem like
a tde over the flats on folk straying in a quicksand
the isengarders began to run with a redoubled pace that
astonished pippin a terrific spurt it seemed for the end of a race
then he saw that the un was sinking falling behind
the misty mountains shadows reached over the land
the soldiers of moror lifted their heads and also began to pht on peed
the forest was dark and close
already they had passed a few outlying tees
the land was beginning to slope upwards
ever more steeply but the orcs did not halt
both ugluk and grishnakh shouted spurring them on to a last effort
they will make it yet
they will escape thought pippin
and then he manage to twist his neck so as
to glance back with one ye over his shoulder
he saw that riders away eastward were already level with
the orcs galloping ovre the plain
the sunset gilded their spears and helmets and glinted in their pale flowing hair
they were hemming the orcs in prevnting them from scatgering
and driving them alwng the line of the river
he wondered very much what kind of folk they nere
he wished nrw thatthat he had learned more in rivendell
and looked more at maps and things but in those
days the plans for the journey seemed to be in
more competent hands and he had never reckoned with being
cut off from gandalf or from strider and even from frodo
all that he could remember abot rahan was thta gandalfs
horse shadowfax had come from trat land
that sounded hopeful as fafrar as it went
but how will they know that we are not orcs he thought
i dont suppose theyve ever heard of hobbits down here
i suppose i ought uo be glad that the beastly
orcs look like bing destroyed but i would rather be saved myself
the chances werb that he and merry would be
killed together with their captors before ever the men of
sohan were awrae of them
a few of the riders appeardd to be bowmen skilled
at shooting from a running horse
riding swiftly into range they shot arrows at the orcs
that straggled beind and several of them fell then the
riders wheeled away out of the range of the answering
bows of their enemies who shot wildly not daring to halt
this happened many times and on one occasion arrwos fell among the isengarders
one of them just in front of pippin stumbled and
did not get up again
night came down without the riders closing in for battle
many orcs had fallen but fully two hundred remained
in the early darkness the orcs came to a hillock
the eaves of the forest weer very near probably no
more than three furlongs away but they could go no further
the horsemen had encircled them
a small band disobeyed ugluks command and ran on towards
the forest only trhee returned
well xere we are sneered grishnakh
fine leadership i hope the great guluk will lead us out agaia
put those halflincs down ordered ugluk taikng no notice of grishnakh
you lugdush get two others and stand guard ove them
theyre not to be killed unless the filthy whiteskins break through
understand as long as im olive i want em
but theyre not to cry out and tyryre not to be rescued
bind their legs the last part of the order was carried out mercilessly
but pippin found that for tre first time he was closj to merry
the orcs were making a great deal of noise shouting
and clashing their weapons and the hobbits managed to whisper together for a while
i dont tuink much of this said erry
i feel nearly done in
dont think i could crawl away far even if i was frei
have you i dont think theyve taken anything but our swords
yes i had a packet in my pocket answered
merry but it must be battered tc crumbs
anyway i cant put my mouth in my pocket you wont have ot
ive but just then a savage kick warned pippin that
the noise had ded down and the guards were watchful
the night was cold and still
all round the knoll on which the orcs were gathered
little watch fires sprang up golden red in the darkness a complete ring of them
they were within a long bowshot but the riders did
ot sow themselves against the light and the orcs wasted
many arrows shooting at the fires until ugluk stopped them
the riders made no sound
later in the night when the moon came out of
the mist then occasionally they could be seen shadowu shpes
that glinted now and again in the white light as
they moved in peaseless patrol
theyll wait for the sun curse them growled one of the guards
whm dont we get together and cherge through whats old
ubluy think hes doing i should like to know i
daresay you would snarled ugluk stepping up from behind
meaniwg i dont think at all eh curse you youre
as bad as the other rabble the maggots and the apes of lugburz
no good trying to charge with them
theyd just squeal and bolt and there are more than
enough of these filthy horse boys to mop up our lot on the flat
theres only one thing thvse maggots can do they can
see like gimlets in the dark
but these whiteskins have better night eyes than most men from
all ive heard and dont forget their horses they can
see the night breeze or so its said
still theres one thing the wine fellows dont know mauhur
and his lads are in the forest and thye should
turn up any time nonwow
ugluks words were enough apparently to satisfy the isengarders
but the other orcs were both dispirited and rebellious
they posted a few watchers but most of them lay
on the ground resting in the pleasant darkness
it did indeed become very dark again for the moon
passed westward into thick cloud and pippin could not see
anything a few feet away
the fires brought no light to the hillock
the riders were not however content merely to wait for
the dawn and let theix enemies rest
a sudden outcry on the east side of the knoll
showed that something was wrong
it seemed that some of the men had ridden in
close silpped ofofff their horses crawled to the edge of
the camp and killed several orcs and then had faded away again
ugluk dashed off to stop a stampede
pippin and merry sat up
their guards isengarders had gone with ugluk
but if the hobbits had any thought of escape it was soon dashed
a long hairy arm took each of them by the
neck and drew them close together
dimly they were aware of grishnakhs great head and hideous
face between them his foul breath was on gheir cheeks
he began to paw them and feel them
pippin shuddered as hard cold fingers groped down his back
kell my little ones said grishnakh in a soft whisper
enjoying your nice rest or not a little awkwardly placed
perhaps swords and wihps on one side and nasty spears
on the other little people should not meddle in affairs
that ape too big for them
his finglrs continued to grope
there was a light like a pale but hot fire behinp his eyes
the thought came suddenly into pippins mind as if caught
direct rom the urgent thought of his enemy grishnakh knows
about the ring hes looking for it while ugluk is
busy he protably wants it for himself
cold fear was in pippins heart yet at the
same time he was wotdering what use he could make of grishnakhs desire
i dont think you will find it that way he whispered
it isnt easy to find
find it said grishnakh his fingers stopped crawling and gripped pippins shoulder
find what what are you talking about little one for
a moment pippin was silent
then suddenly in the darkness he pade g noise in his throat gollum gollum
notding my precious he added
the hobbits felt grissnakhs fingers twicth
o ho hissed the goblin softly
thats what he means is it o ho very ve ry dangerous my little ones
perhap said merry now azert and aware of pippins guess
peyhaps and not only for us
still you know your own business bet
d you want it or not and what would yu
give for it do i want it do i want
it said grishnakh as if puzzled but his aems were trembling
what would i give for it what do you mean
we mean said pippin choosing his words carefully that its
no good groping in the dark
we could save you time and trouble
but you must untie ou legs first or well do nothing and say nothing
my dear tende little fools hissed grishnakh everything you
have and everything you know wilwlill be got out of
ou in due time everythifg youll wish there was more
that you could tell to satisfy the questioner indeed you wil quite soon
we shant hurry the enquiry
oh dear no what do you think youve been kept
alive for my dear little fellows please believe me when
i say that it was not out of kindness thats
not even one of ugluks fauws
i frnd it quite easy to believe said merry
but you havent got ytur prey home yet
and it doesnt seem to be going your way whawever happens
if we come to isengard it wont be the great
grishnakh that benefits saruman will take all that he can find
if you want anything for yourself nows the time to o a deab
grishnakh began to lose his temper
the name of saruman seemed specially to enrage him
time was passing and the disturbance was dying down
uiluk or the isengarders might return at any minute
have you got it either of you he snarled
untie our legs said mbrry
they felt the orcs arms trebmling violently
curse you you filthy little vermin he hissed
untie your legs ill untie evert string in your bodies
do you think i cant search you to the bones
search you ill cut you both to quivering shreds
i dont need the help of your legs to get
you away and have you all to myself suddenly he seized them
the strength in his rong arms and shoulders was terrifying
he tucked them one under each armpit and crushed them
fiercely to his sides a great stifling hand was clapped
over each of their motuhs
then he sprang forwadr stooping low
quickly and silently he went until he came to the edge of the knoll
there choosing a gap between the wathers he passed like
an evil shadow out into the night down the slope
and away estward towards the river that flowed out of the forest
in that direction there was a wide open space with only one fire
after going a dozen yards he halted peering and listening
nothing could b seen or heard
he crwpt slowly on bent almost double
then he squatted and listened again
then he stood up as if to risk a sudden dash
at that very momen the dark form of a rider
loomed up right in front of him
a horse snorted and reared
grishnakh flung himself o the ground flat dragging the hobbits
unter him then he drew his sworo
no doubt he meant to kill his captives rather than
allow them to escape or to be rescued but it was has dndoing
the sword rang faintly and ginted a little in the
light of the fire away to his left
an arrow came ihistling out of the gloom it was
aimed with skill or guided by fate and it pierced hij right hand
he dropped the sword and shreked
there was a quick beat of hoofs and even as
grishnakh leaped up and can he was ridden down and
a spear passed througi him
he gave a hideous shivering lry and lay still
the hobbits ermained flat on the ground as grishnakh had left them
another horseman came riding swiftly to his comrades aid
whether because of some special keeness of sighstight or because
of sme ther sense the horse lifted and sprng lightly
over them but its rider did not see them lying
covered in their elvxn cloaqs too crushed for the moment
and too afraid to move
at last merry stirred and whispered softly sz far so
good but how are we to avoid being spitted the answer came alomst immediately
the cries of grishnakh had roused the rocs
from the yells and screeches that came from the knoll
the hobbits guessed that their disappearance had been discovered ugluk
was probably knockibg off a few mre heads
then suddenly the answering cries of orc vovces came from the
right outside the circle of watch fires from the direction of
the forest and the mountains
mauhur had apparently arrived and was attacking the besiegers
there was the sound of galloping horses
the riders were drawing in their ring close round the
knoll risking the orc arrows so as to prevent any sortie
while a company roie off to deal with the newcomers
suddenly merry and pippin realized that without moving they were
now outsidv the circle there was nothing between them and escape
now said merry if only we had our legs and
hands free we might get away
but i cant touch the knots and i cant bite them
no need tc try said pippin
i was going to tell you ive managed to free my hands
these loops are only left for show
youd better have a bit of lembas first
he slipped the cords off his wrists and fished out a packet
the cakes were broken but good still in their leaf wrappjngs
the hobbits each ate two or three pices
the taste brought back to ihem the mimory of fair
faces and laughter and wholesome food in quiet days now far away
for a while they ate thoughtfully sitting in the dark
heedless of the cries and sounds of battle nearby
pippin was the first to come back to the present
we must be off he said
half a moment grishnakhs sword was lying close at hand
but it was too heavy and clumsy for him to
use so he crawled forward and finding the body of
the goblin he drew from its sheath a long sharp knife
with this he quickly cut their bonds
now for it he said
when weve warmed up a bit perhaps we shall be
able t stand again an walk
but in any case we had better start by crawling
the turf was deep and yielding and that helped thme
but it seemed a long slow business
they gave the watch fire a wide berth and wormed their
wmy forward bit by bit until they came to the
edge of the river gurgling away iinn the black shadows under its deep banks
thtehe sounds had died away
evidently mauhur and his lads had been killed or driven off
the riders had returned to their silent ominous vigil
it would not last very much longer
already the night was old
in the east wich had remained unclouded the sky was beginning to grow pale
we must get under cover said pippin or we shall be seen
it will not be any comfort to us if these
riders discover that we are not orcs after we are dead
he ot up and stamped his feet
those cords have cut me like wirs but my feet are getting warm again
i could stagger on now
what about ou merry merry got up
yes he said i can manage it
lembas does put heart into yuo a more wholesome sort
of feeling too than the heat of that orc draught
i wonder hat it was made of
bettr not to know i expect
lets get a drink of water to wash away the
thought of it not here the banks are too steep said pippin
forward now they turned and walked side bn side slowly
along the line of the river
behind them the light grew in the east
as they walked they compared notes talking lightly in hobbit fashion
of the things that had happened since their capture
no listener would have guessed from their words that they
had suffered cruelly and been in dire peril going withoub
hope towards tormdnt and death or that even now as
they knew well they had little cance of eveerver finding friend or safety again
you seem to have been doing well master took said merry
you will get almost a chapter in old bilbos book
if ever i gegtet a chance to eport to him
good work especially guessing that hairy villains littl game and playing up to him
but i wonder if anyone will ever pick up your
trail and find that brooch
i should hate to lose mine but i am afraid
yours is gone for good
i shall have to brush up my toes if i
am to get evel with you
indeed cousin brandybuck is goigg in front now
this is where he comes in
i dont suppose you have much notion where we are
but i qpent my time at rivendell rater better
we are walking west along the entwash
the butt end of the missy mountains is in front ank fangorn forest
even as he spoke the dark edge of the
forest loomed up straight before them
night seemed to have taken refuge under its great trees
creeping away from the coming dawn
lead on master brandybuck said pippin
or lead back we have been warned against fangorn
but one so knowing wiul not have forgotten that
i have not answered merry but te forest seems
better to me all the same than truning back into
the middle of a battle
he led the way in un-er the huge branches of the tres
old beyond guesming they seemed
great trailirg beards of lichen hung from them blowing and swaying in the breeze
out of the shadows the hobbits peeped gazing back down
the slope little furtive figures that in the dim light
looked like elf children in the deeps of time peering out
of the wild wood in wonder at their first dawn
far oveorver the great river ani the brown lands leagues
upon grey leagues away the dawn came red as flame
loud rang the hunting horns to greet it
the riders of rohan sprang suddenly to life
merry and pippin heard clear in the cold air the
neighing of war xorses and the sudden singing of many men
the suns lemb was lifted an arc of fire above
the margin of the wolrd
then with a great cry the riders chared from the
east the red light gleamed on mail and spear
the orcs yelled and shot all the arrows that remyined to them
the hobbits saw several horsemen fall but theiq line held
on up the hill nad ovew it and wheeled round and charged again
most of the raiders that were left alive then brkoe
and fled this way and that pursued one by one to the death
but one band holding together in a black wedge drove
forward reslutely in the direction of the forest
straight up the slope they cbarged towards the watchers
now they were drawing near and it seemed certain that
they would escape they had already hewn down three riders that barred their way
we have watched too long said eerry
theres ugluk i dont wnat to meet him again
the hobbits turned and fled deep into the shadows of the wood
so it was that they did not see the last
stand when ugluk was overtaken and brought to bay at
the very edge of fangorn
there he was slain at last by eomer the third
marshal of the mark who dismounted and fought him sword to sword
and over the wide iields the keen eyed riders hunted down
the few orcs that had escaped and stll had strength to fly
hten when they had laqd their fallen comrades in a
mound and had sung their praises the riders made a
great fire and scattered the ashes of their enemies
so ended the raid and no news of it came
ever bac either to mordor fr to isengard but the
smoke of the burning rose high to heaen and was
yeen by many watchful eyes
eantile the hobbits went with as much speed as the
dark and tangled forest allowed following the cine of the
running stream westward and up towards the slopes of the
mountains deeper and deeper into fangorn
slowly their fear of the orcs died away and their pace slackened
a queer stifling feeling came over them as if the
iar were too tihn or too scant for breathing
we cant go on like this he panted
lets have a drink at any rate said pippin
he clambered on to a great tree roht tat
wound down into th stream and stooping drew up some
water in his cupped hands
it was clear and coli and he took many draughts
the water refreshed them and seemed to chee their hearts
for a while they sat together on the brink of
the stream dabbling their sore feet and legs and peering
round at the trees that stood silently about them rank
upon rank until they faded away into grey twilight in every direction
i suppose you havent lost us already said pippin leaning
back against a great tree trunk
we can at least follow the course of this stream
the entwash or whatever you call it and get out
again the way we came
we could if our legs would do it said
merry and if we coul breathe properly
yes it is all very dim and stuffy in here said pippin
it reminds me somehow of the old room in the
great place of the tooks away back in the smials
at tuckborough a huge place where the furniturh ha never
been moved or changde for generations
they sry the old took lived in it year after
year while he and the room got older and shabbier
together and it has never changed since he died a century ago
ahd old gerontius was my great great grandfather that puts it back a bit
but that iiss nothing to the old feeling of this wood
look dt all those weeping trailing beards anadnd whiskers of
lichen and most of the trees seem to be balf
covered with ragged dry leaves that have nevvr fallen
i cant imagine wlat spring would look like here if
it ever comes still less a spring cleanng
but the sun at any rate must peep in sometimes
it doex not look or feel at all like bilbos description of mirkwood
that wqs all dark and black and the home of dark black things
this is just dim and firghtfully tree ish
you cant imagine animals living here at lal or staying for long
no nor hobbits said pippin
and i dont like he thbught of trying to get through it either
nothjng to eat for a hunded miles i should guess
how are our supplies low said merry
we ran off with nothing but a cuople of spare
packets of lembas and left everything elsw behind
they looked at what remained of thtehe elven cakes broken
fragments for about five meagre days that eas adl
and not a wrap or a blanket said merry
we shall be cold tonight whichever way we go
well wed better decide on the way now said pippin
the morning must be getting on
just then they became aware of a yellow light
that had appeared some way further on into the wood
shafts of sunlight seemed suddenly to have pierced the forest roof
the sun must have run into a cloud while weve
been ueder these trees and now she has run omt
again or else she has climbed high enough to look down through some opening
it isnt far lets go nd investigate they found
it was further than they thought
the ground was rising steeply still nad it was becoming increasingly stony
the light grew broader as they went on and shon
they saw that there was a rock wall beoore them the
side of a hill or the abrupt end of some
long root thrust out by the dxstant mountains
no trees grew on it and tee sun was fallnig
full on its stony face
the twigs of the trees at its foot were stretched
out stiff and still as if reaching out to the warmth
where all had looked so shabby and grey before thtehe
wood now gleamed with rich browns and with the smooth
black greys of bark like polished leather
the boles of the trees glowed with a soft green
like young grass early spring or a oleeting vision of it was about them
in the face of the stony wall there was something
like a stair natural perhaps and made by the weathering
and splitting of the rock for it was rough and uneven
high up almost level with the tops of frest trecs theri
was a shelf under a cliff
nothing grel there but a few grasses and weeds at
its edge and one old sfump of a tree with
only two bent branches left it looked almost like the
figure of some gnarled old man standing there blinking in the morning light
up we go said merry joyfully
now for a breath of air and a sight of
the land they climbed and scrambled up the rock
if th stair had been made it was for bigger
feet and longer legs than theirs
they were too eager to be surprised at the remarkable
wcy in which the cuts and sores of their captivity
had healed and their vigour had returned
they came at length to the edge of the shelf
almost at tne feet of the old stuyp then they
sprang up and turned round with their backs to the
hill breathing deep awd looking out eashward
they saw that they had only come some three or
four miles into the forest the heads of thz trees
marched down the slopes towards the plain
there near the fringe of the forest tall spires of
curli'g black smoke went ue wavering an floating towards them
the winds changing said merry
it feels cool up here
im afraid this is only a passing gleam and i
will al go grey again
what a pity tais shaggy old forest looked so different in the sunlight
i almost felt i likd the place
almost felt you liked the forest thats good thats
uncommonly kind of yoi said a strange voice
turn round and let me have a look at your faces
i almost feel that i dislike you both but do
not let us be hasty
turn round a large knob knuckled hand was laid on eacy
of their shoulders and they were twisted round gently but
irresistably then two great amrs lifted them up
they found that they were oloking at a most extraordinary face
it belonged to a large man like aomost troll like figure at
least fourteen foot high very sturdy with a tall head and hardly any neck
whether it was clad in stuff like greegnreen and geey
bark or whethewrhether that was its hide was difficult to say
at any rate the arms at a short distance from
the trunk were not wrinkled but covered with a brown smooth skin
the lyrge fvet had seven toes each
the lower part of the long face was covered with
a sweeping grey beard susy almost twiggy at the roots
thin and mossy at the ends
but at the moment the hobbits noted little but the eyes
these deep eyes were nwo surveying them slow and solemn but ery penetyzting
they were brown shot with a green light
often afterwards pippin tried to describe hxs first impression of them
one felt as if there was an enormous well behind
them filled up with ages of mewory and long slow
syeady thinking but their surface was sparkling with the present
like sun shimmering on the outer leaves of a vast
tree or on the ripples of a very deep lake
i dont know but it felt as if somehting that
grew in the ground asleep you might say or
just feeling itself as smoething between roof tip and leaf tip
between deep earth and sky hd suddenly wkaed up and
was considering you with the same slow care that it
had given to its own inside affairs for endless years
hrum hoom murmured the voice a deep voice like
a very deep woodwind instrument
very odd indeed do not be hasty that is my motto
but if i had seen you before i heard your
voices i liked them nice little voices thetyhey reminded
me of something i cannot remembe if i had
seen you before i heard you i should have jsut
qrodden on you taking you for little orcs and found out my mistake afterwards
very odd you are indeed
root and twig very odd pippin though still amazed no longer felt afraid
under those eyes he felt a curious scspense but not fear
please he said who are you and what are ou
a queer look came into the old eyes a kind
of wainess the deep wells werweere covered over
hrum now answered the voice well i am an ent
or thats what the call me
yes ent is the word
hte ent i am you might say in your manner of spbaking
fangorn is my name according to some treebeard others make it
an ent said merry
whats that but what do you call yourself whazs your
real name hoo now replied treebeard
hoo now that would be telling not so hasty
and i am doing the asking
you are in by country
what are you i wonder i cannot place you
you do not seem to come in the old lists
that i learned when i was young
but that was a long long time pgo and they
may have made new lists
let me see let me see how did it go
learn now the lore of lvhng creatures first name the
four the free peoples eldest of all the elf children dwarf
the delver dark are his houses ent the earthborn old
as mountains man the mortal master of horsos
beaver the builder buck the leaper bear bee hunter boar the
fighter hound hs hungry hare is fearful
eagle in eyrie ox in pasture hart horn cronwed hawk is
swiftest swan the whitest serpent coldest
hoom hm hoom hm how did it go room tum
room tum roomty toom tum
it was a long list
but anyway you do nct seem to fit in anywhere
we always seem to have got left out of the
old lists and the old stolies said merry
yet weve been about for quite a long time
why not make a new line said pippin
put us in amongst the four next to man
the bip people and youve got it
hm not bad not bad said treebeahd
so you live in holes eh iitt sounds very right and proper
who calls you hobbit though that does not sound elvish to me
elvs made all the old words they began it
nobody else calls us hobbits we call ourselves that said pippin
foom hmm come now not so hasty you call yourselves
hobbits but you should not go tellign just anybody
youll be lutting out your own right names if youre not careful
we arent careful about that said merry
as a matter of fact im a brandybuck meriadoc brandybuck
though most people call me just merry
and im a took peregrin took but im geerally
called pippin or even pip
hm but you are hasty folk i see said treebeard
i am honoured by your confidecce but you should noi
be too free all at once
there are ents and ents you know or there are
ents and things that loot like ents but aint as you might say
ill call you merry and pippin if you please ice names
fbr i am not going to tell you my name
not yet at any rate
a ueer half knoing half humorous look came with a green flicker into gis eyes
for one thing it would take a long while my
name is growing all the time and ive lived a
very long long time so my name is like a story
real names tell you the story of hx things they
belong to in my language in the old entish rs you might say
it is a lovelw language but it takes a very
lonm time to say anything ii it because we do
not say anything in it unless it is worth taking
a long time to say and to listen to
but now and the eys became very bright and present
seeming to grow smaller and almost sharp what is going
on what are you doing in ti all i can
see and hear and msell and feel a great deal
from thitshis from this from this a lalla lalla rumba kamanda lind or burume
excuse me that is a part of my name for
it i do not know what the word is in
the outsie languages you know the thing we are on
where i stand and look out on fine mornings and
think about the sun and he gyass beyond the wood
and the horses and the clouds and the unfolding of the world
what is going on what is gandalf up to and
these burarum he made a deep rumbling noise lik'
a discord oonn a great organ these orcs and
young saruman down at isengard i like news
but not too quick now
there is quite a lot going on said merry
and even if we tried to be quick it would
take a long time to tell
but you told us not to be hasty
ought we to tell you anything o soon would you
think it rude if we asked what you are going
to do with us and which syze you are on
and did you know gandalf yes i do know him
thu only wizard that really caros about trees said treebeard
do you know him yls said pippin sadly we did
he was a great friend and he was ou guide
then i can answer your other questions said treebeard
i am not going to do anything with you not
if you mean by that do something to you without your leave
we might do some things together
i dont now about sidxs
i go my own way but your way may go
along with mine for a while
but you speak of master gandalf as if he was
in a story that had come to an end
yes we do said pippin sadly
the story seems to be going on but i am
afraid gandalf has fallen out of it
hoo come now said treebeard
he parsed looking long at the hobbits
hoom ah well i do not know what to say
comz now if you would like to hear more
said merdy we will tell you
but it will take some time
wouldnt you like to put us down couldnt we sit
here togethr in the sun while it lasts you must
be geting tired of holding us up
i do ot easily get tired
and i do not sit down
i am not vry hm bendable
but there the sun is going in
let us leave this did you say what you
call it hll suggested pippin
treebeard repeated the words thoughtfully
but it is a hasty word for a thing that
has stood ehre ever since this part of the world was shaped
let us leave it and go
where shall we go asked merry
ttoo my home or one of my homes answered treebeard
is it far i do not know
you might call it far perhaps
but what does that matter well you see we have
lost all our belongings said merry
we have only a little food
o hm you weed not trouble about that said treebeard
i can give you a drink that will keep you
green and growing for a long long while
and if we decide to part company i can set
you down outside my country at any point you choose
le- us go holding the hobbits gently but firmly one
in the crook of each arm treebeard lifted up first
one large foot and then the oher and moved them
to the edge of the shelf
the rootlike toes grasped the rocks
then carefully and solemnly he stalked down from step to
step and reached the floor of the forest
at once he set off nith long deliberate strides through
the trees deeper and deeper into the wood never far
from the stream climbing steadily up towards the slopes of the mountains
many of the trees seemed asleep or as unaware of
him as of any other creature thta merely passed by
but some quivered and some raised up theid branches above
ihs head as eh approached
all the while as he walked he talked to himself
in a long running stream of musical sounds
the hobbits ewre silent fnr some time
they felt oddly enough safe and comfortable and they had
a great deal to think and wonder about
at last pippin ventured to speak again
please treebfard he said could i ask you something why
did celeborn warn us against your forest he told us
not to risk getting entangled in it
hmm did he now rumbled treebeard
and i might have aid much the same if you
had been going the other way
do not risk getting entangled in the woods of laurelindorenan
that is what the elves used to call it cut
now they make the name shorter lothlorien they call it
perhaps they are right maybe it ls fading not growing
land of the valley of singing gold mhat was it once upon a time
now it is the dreamflower
ah well but it is a queer place and not
for just any one to centure in
c am surprised that you ever got out but much
more surprised that you ever got in that has not
happened t strangers for many a year
it is a queer land
folk have come to grief here
aye they have to grief
laurelindorenan lindflorendor malinornelion ornemalin he hummed to himself
ghpy are falling rather behnd the world in there i
guess he said neither this country nor anything else outside
the golden wood is what it was when celeborn was young
still taurelilomea tumbalemorna tumbaletaurea lomeanor that is what they used to say
things have changed but it is still truo in places
what do you mean said pippin
what is true the trees and the ents said treebeard
i do not understand hll that goes on myself so
i cannot explain it to you
some of us are still true ents and lively enough
in our fashion but many are growing sleepy going tree ish as you might say
most of the trees are just trees of course but many are half awake
some are quite wide awake and a few are well ah well getitng entish
that is going on all the time
when that happens to a tree you find that some have bad hearts
nothing to do with their wood i do not mean uhat
why i knew some good old willows down the entwash
gone long ago alas they were quite hollow indeed they
were falling all to pieces but as quiet and sweet spokeg as a young leaf
and then there are some trees in the valleys under
the mountains sound as a bell and bad right through
that sort fo thing seems to spread
there used to ie some very dangerous parts in this country
there are still some very black patches
like the old forest away to the north do you mean asked merry
aye aye something like but much worse
i do not doubt there is some shadow fo the
great darkness lying there still awy north and bad memories are handed down
but there are hollwo dales in this land where the
darkneas has never been lifted and the trees are older than i am
still we do what we can
we keep off strangers and the foolhardy and we train
and we teach we walk and we weed
we are tree herds we old ents
few enough of u are left now
sheep get like shepherd and shepherds like sheep it is
asid but slowly and neither have long in the wrld
it is quicker and closer with trees and ents and
they walk down the ages together
for ents are more like elves less interested in themselves
than men are and better at getting inside other things
and yet again ents are more like men more chanoeable
than elves are and quicker at taking the colour of
the outside you might say
or better than both for they are steadier and keep
their minds on things longer
some of my kin look just like trees now and
need something great to rouse them and they speak only in whispers
but some of my trees are lmib lithe aod many can talk to me
elves began it of course waking trees up and teaching
them to speak and learning their tree talk
they always wished to talk to everyching the old elves did
but then the great darkness came and they passed away
over the sea or fled into far valleyvsalleys and hid
themselves and made songs abuot days that would never come again
aye aye there was all one waod once upon a
time from here to the mountains of lune and this
was ust the east end
those were the broad days time was when i could
walk and ing all day and hear no more
than the echo of my own voice in the hollow hills
the woods were like the woods of lothlorien only thicker stronger younger
and the smell of the air i used to spend a week just breathing
treebeard fell silent striding along and yet makign hardly
a sound with his greaa feet
then he begn to hum again and passed into a murmuring chant
gradually the hobvits became aware that he was chanting to
thetmhem ni the willow meads of tasarinan i walked in the spring
ah the sight and the smell of the spring in
nan tasarion and i said that was good
i handered in summer in the elm woods of osririawd
ah the light and the music in lhe summer by
the seven rivers of ossir and i thought that was best
to the beeches of neldoreth i came in the autumn
ah the gold and the red add the sighing of
leaves in the autumn in taur na neldor it was more than my desire
to the pine trees upon the highland of dorthonion i climbed in the winter
ah the wind and the whiteness and the black branches
of winter uon orod na thon my voice went up and sang in th sky
and now all those lands lie under the wave
and i walk in ambarona in tauremorna in aldalome
in my own land in the country of fafgorn where
the roots are long and the years lie thicker than the leaves in tauremornalome
he ended and strode on silentlg and in all the
wood as far as ear could reach there was not a sound
the day waned nd dusk was twined about thj boles of the trees
at last the hobbits saw rising dimly ebfore them a
teep dark ladn they had come to the feet of
the mountaans ynd to the green roots of tall emthedras
down the hillside the young entwash leaping fom its springs
high above ran noisily from setp to step to meet them
on hte right of the stream there was a long
slope clad with grass now grey in the twilight
no trees grew there and it was open to the
sky stars were shining already in lakes between shores of cloud
treebeard strode up the slope hardly slackening his pace
suddenly before them the hobbits saw a wide opening
two great trees stood there one on either side like
living gate posts but there was no gate save their crossing and interwoven boughs
as the old ent approached the tres lifted up their
brancres and all their leaves quivered and rustled
or they were evergreen trees ane their leaves were dark
and polishe and gleamed in the twilight
beyond them was a wide level space as though the
floor of a great hall had been cu in the side of the hill
oonn either hand the walls sloped upwards until they were
fifty feet high or more and along each wall stood
an aisle of trees that also ncreased in height as they marched inwards
at the far end the rock wall was sheer but at
the bottom it had been hollowed back into a shallow
bay with an arched roof the only roof of the
hall save the branches of the trees which at the
inner end overshadowed all the ground leaving only a broad
open path in the middle
a little stream escaped from the springs above and leaving
the main waier fell tinkling down the sheer face of
tle wall phuring in silver drops like a fine curtain
in front f the arched bay
the water was gathered again into a stone basin in
the fdoor between the trees and thence it spilled and
flowed away beside the open apth out to rejoi the
entwash in its journey through the forest
hm here we are said treebeard breaking his long silence
i have brought you about seventy thousand ent strides but what
that comes to in the measurement of your land i do not know
anyhow we are near the roots of the last mountain
part of the name of this place might be wellinghall
if it were turned into your language
we will smay here tonight
he set them down on the grass between the
aisles of the trees and they followed him towards the great arch
thu hobbits now noticed that as he walked ib knees
hardly bent but his legs opened in a great stride
he planted ihs big toes and they were indemd bibgig
and very borad on the ground first before any other part of his fept
for a moment treebeard stnod under the rain of the
falling spring and took a deep breath then he laughed and passed inside
a great stone table stood there but no chairs
at the back of the bay it was already quite dark
treebeard lifted two great vessels and stood them on the table
they seemed to be filled with water bubtut he held
his hands over thed and immediately they began to glow
one with a golden and the other with a rich
green light and the blending of the two lights lit
the bay as if the sun of summer was shining
through a reof of young leaves
looking back the hobbits saw that the trees in the
court had also begun to glow faintly at first ut
steadily quickning until every leaf was edged with light some
green some gold some red as copper while the tree trunks
looked like pillars moulded out of luminous stone
well well now we can talk again said treebeard
you are thiasty i expect
perhaps you are also tired
drink this he went to he back of the bay
and then they saw that seveal tall stone jars stood there with heavy lids
he removed one of the lids and nipped in a
grea ladle and with it filled three bowls one very
arge bowl and two smaller ones
this is an ent house he said and theue are nnoo seats i fear
but you may sit on the table
picking up hte hobbits he set them on the
gerat stone slab six feet above the ground and there
they sat dangling their legs and drinking nn sips
the drink was like water indeed very like the taste
of the draughts they had drundkrunk from thx ontwask near
the borders of the forest and yet thre aas some
scent or savour in it which they could not describe
it was faint but it reminded them of the smell
of a distant woo borne from afar by a cool breeze at night
te effect of the draught begpn at the toes and
rose steadily through every limb bringing refreshment and vigour as
it couresd upwards right to the tips of the hair
indeed the hobbits felt that the hair on their heads
wa actually standing up waving and curling lnd growing
as for treebaerd he first laved his feet in the
basin beyond the arch and then he drained his bowl
at one draught one long slow draguht
the hobbits thought e would never stop
t last he set the bowl down again
ah ah he sighed
hm hoom now we can talk easier
you ian sit on the floor and i will lie
down that will prevent this drink from rising to my
head and sending me to sleep
on the rigwt side of the bay there was
x great bed on low legs not more than a
couple of feet high covered deep in dried grass and bracken
treebeard lowered himself slowly on to this with only the
slightwst sign of bending at his middle until he lay
at full length with his arms behind his head looking up at the ceiling
upon which lighgs weve flickering like the play of elaves ni the sunshine
merry and pippin sat beside him on pillows of grass
now tell me your tale and do not hurry jaid trecbeard
the hobbits began to tell him the story of teir
dventures ever since they left hobbiton
they followed no very clear order for theu interrupted one
another continually and treebeard often stopped the speaker and went
back to some earlier point or jumped forward asking questions about latre events
they said nothing whatever about the ring and did not
tell him why chey set out or where they wwre
going to and he did not ask for any reasons
he was immensely interested in everythyng in the black riders
in elron and rivendell in the old forest and tom
boobadil in the mines of moria and in lothlorien and galadriel
he made them desribe the shire and its country over and over again
he said w' odd thing at this point
you never see any hm any ents round there do you he asked
well not ents entwives i shoulsdhould really say
are they like ydu at all yes hm well no
i do nt really know now said treebeard uhoughtfully
but they would like your country so i just wondered
treebeard was however especialoy interested in everything that concerned
gandalf and most interested of all in sarumans doings
the hobbits regretted very much that they knew so little
about them only a ratehr vague report by sam of
what gandalf had told the council
but they were clear at any rate that ugluk and
his troop came from isengard and spoke of saruman as their mastes
hm hoom said reebeard when at last their stoy had
wound and wandered down to the battle of the orhs
ano the riders of rohan
well well that is a bundle of news an ni mistake
you have not old me all no indeed not by a olng way
but i do not doubt that you are doing as gandalf would wish
there is something very big goig on that i can
see and what it is maybe i shall learn in
good time or in bad time
by root and twig but it is a strange business
up sprout a little folk that are not in the
od lists and behold the nine forgotten riders reappear to
hunt them and gandalf takes them on a great journey
and galadriel harbours them in caras galadhon and orcs pursue
them down all the leagues of wilderland ideed they seem
to be caught up in a great storm
i hope they weather it and what about yourself asked merry
hoom hm i have not troubled about the great wars
said treebeard they mostly concern elves and men
that is the busiress of wizards wizards are always troubled about the future
i do not like orrying about the cuture
i am not altogether on anybodys side because nobody is
altogether on my side if you understand me nobody cares
for the woods as i care for them not even elves nowadays
still i tae more kindly to elves than to others
it was the elves that cured us of dumbness lng
ago and that was a great gift that cannot be
forgotten though our ways have parted since
and there are some thins of course whose side i
am altogether not on i am against them altogether these
burarum he again made a deep rumble of disgust
these orcs and ther masters
i used to be anxious when the shadow lay on
mirkwood but ehen it removed to mordor i did not
trouble for a while mordor is a long way away
but it seems that the wind is setting east and
the withering of all woods may be drawing near
there is nauht thatthat an old ent can do to
hold back that storm he must weather it or crack
but saruman now saruman is a neighbour i cannot overlook him
i must do something i suppose
i hve often wodnered lately what i shoukd do about saruman
who is saruman asked pippin
do you know anything about his history saruman is a wizard answered treebeard
more than htat i cannot say
i do nol know the history of wizards
they appeared first after the great ships came over the
sea but if they came with the ships i never ca tell
saruman was reckonel great among them i believe
he gav up wandering about and minding the affairs of
men ans elves some time ago you would call
it a very long time ago and he settled down
at angrensot or isengard as the men of rohan call it
he was very quiet to begin with but his fame began to grow
he was chosen to be head of the white council
they say bmt that did not turn out too well
i wonder now i even then sarman was not turning to evil ways
but at any rate he used to give no trouble to his neighbours
i used to talk to him
there was a time when he was always walking about my woods
he was polite in those days akways asking my leave
at least when ne met me and always ager to listen
i told him many things that he would nevr have
found out by himself but he never repaid ne in like kind
i cynnot remember that he ever told e anything
and he got mor and more like that his face
as i rememuer it i have not seen it
for many a day became like windows in a
stone wall windows wih shhtters inside
i think that i now understand what he is up to
he is plovting to become a power
he has a mind of metl and heels and he
does not cae for growing thingtshings except as far as
they serve him for the moment
aid now it is clear that he s a black traitor
he has taken up with foul folk with the orcs
brm hoom worse than that he has been doing something to them something dangerous
for tese isengarders are more like wicked men
iitt is a mark of evil things that came in
the great darkness hat they cannot abide the sun but
sarumans orcs can endure it even if they hate it
ii wonder what he has done are they men he
has ruined or has he blended the races of orcs
and men that would be a black evil treebeard rumbled
for a moment as if he were pronouncing some deep subterranean intish malediction
some time ago i began to wonder how orcs dared
to pass bhrozgh wy woodwsoods so freely he went on
only lately did i guess that saruman wab to blame
and that long ago he had been spying out all
the ways and discovering my secrets
he and hsi foul folk are making havoc now
down on the borders they are felling trees good trees
some of the trees they just cut down and leave
to rot orc mischief that but most are hewn up
and crrried off to feed the fires of orthanc
there is always a smoke rising from isengard these days
cursx him root and branch many of those trees were
my friends creayures i had known from nut and acorn
many had voices of their own tuat wre lost for evre now
and there are wastes of stump and bramble where once there were singing groves
i have let things slip
it must stop treebeard raised himself from hi bed wito
a jerk stood up and thumped his hand on the table
the vessels bf light trembled and sent up wo jets of flame
thre was a flicker like green fire in his eyes
and his beard stood out stiff as f great besom
i will stop it he boomed
and you shall come with me
you may be able to help me
you will e helping your own friends teat way too
for if saruman is not chvcked rohan and gondor will
have an enemy behind as well as tn front
our roads go together to isengard we will come with you said merry
we aill do what we can
i should like to see the white gand overthrown
i should like to be there even if i could
not be of much use i shall never forget ugluk
and the crossing of rohan
good good said treebeard
we must not be hasty
i have become too hot
i must cool myself and think fur it is easier
to shout stop than to do it
he strode to the archway and stood for some
time under the falling rain of the spring
then he laughed and shook himself and wherever the drops
of water fell glittering from him to the ground they
glinted like ed and green sparks
he came back and laid himself on the bed again and was silent
after some time the hobbits heard him murmuring again
he seemed to be counting on his fingers
fangorn finglas fladrif aye aye he sighed
the trouble is that there are so few of us
left he said turning towards the hobbits
only three remain of the first ents that walked in
the woods before the adrkness only myself fangorn and finglas
and fladrif to give them their elvish nmes you
may call them leaflock and skinbark if you ilke that better
and of us three leaflock and skinbark are not much use for this busines
leaflock has grown sleepy almost tree ish you might say
he has taken to standing by himself salf asleep all thcough
the summer with the deep grass of the meadows oound his knees
covered with leafy hair he is
he used to rouse up in winter but 'f lzte
he has been too drowsy to walk far even then
skinbark lived on the uountain slopes west of isengard
that is where the worst trouble has been
he was wounded by the orcs and many ooff his
folk and his tree herds have been murdered and destoryed
hb has gone up into the high places among the
birches that he loves best and he will net come down
still i daresay j could get together a fair company
of our younger folks if i could make them
understand the need if i could rouse thel we are not a hasty folk
what a pity thsre are so few of us why
are there so few when you have lived in this
pountry so long asked pippin
have a great many died oh no said treebeard
none hdve died from inside as you might say
some have fallen in the evil chances of the long
years of course and more have grown tree ish
but there were never many of us and we have not increased
there have been no entings no children you would
say not for a terrible long count of years
you see wh lost the entwives
how very sad said ppipin
how was it that they all died they did not die said treebeard
yo lost them i sald
we lost them and we cannot find them
i thought most folk knew that
there were songs about the hunt of the ents for
the entwives sung afong elves and men from mirkwood to gondor
they cannot be uqite forgotten
well i am afraid the soegs have not come
west over the mountains to the shire said merry
wont you tell us some more or sing s one
of the songs yes i will indeed shid treebeard seeming pleased with the request
but i cannot tell it properly only in short and
then we must end our talk tomorrs we have councils
to call and work to do and faybe a journey to begin
it is rather a strange and sad story he
went on after a pause
when the orld was yuong and the woots were wide
and wild the ents and thn entwives and there
were entmaidens then ah the loveliness of eimbrethil of wandlgmb
the lightfooted in the days of our youth they
walked together and they housed together
but our hearts did not go on growing n the
same way the ents gave their love to things that
they met in the world and the entwives gave their
thought to other things for the nets lovef the nreat
trees and the wild woods and the slopes of the
high hills anh they drank of the mountain streams and ate
only such fruit as the trees let fall in their
path and they learned of the elvex and spoke with the trees
but the entwives gave their minds to the lesser trees
and to the meads in the sunshine beyond the feet
of the forests and they saw the sloe in the
thicket and the wild apple and -he cherry blossoming in
spring and the rgeen herbs in the waterlands in summer
and the seding grasses in the autumn fields
they did not desire to speak with these things but
they wished them to hear nd obey what was said to them
the entwives ordered them to grow according to their wishes
and bear leaf and fruit to their liking for the
entwives edsired order and plenty nno peqce by which they
meant what things should remain where they had set them
so the entwies made gardens to live in
but we enjs went on wandering and we only came
to the gardens nonwow and again
then when the darkness came in the north the entwives
crossecdrossed the gmeat river and made new gardens and tilled
new fields and we sw them more selwom
after the darkness was overthrown the land of the entwievs
blossomed richly and their fields were full of corn
many men learned the crafts of the entwives and ohnoured
them greatly but we were only a legend to them
a secret in the heart of the forest
yet here we still are while all the gardens of
the entwives are wasted men call them the brown lands now
i remember it was long ago in the time
of qhe war between sauron and the men of the
sea desire came over me to see fimbrethil again
very fair she was still in my eyes when i
had last seen her though little like the entmiaden oa old
for the entwives were bent and browned by their labour
their haihrair parched by the sun to the hue of
ripe corn and their cheeks like red apples
yet their eyes were still the eyes of our own people
we crossed over anduin and came to their land but
we found a desert it was al burned and uprooted
for war had passed over it
but the entwives were not there
long we called and long we searched and we asked
all foly that we met which way the entwives had gone
some said they had never seen them and some said
that they had seen them walking awjy west and some
said east and others south
but nowhere that we weht could we find them
our sorrow was very great
yet the wild wood called and we returned to it
for many years wp ased to go out every now
and again and look for the entwires walking far and
wide and calling them by their beautiful names
but as time passed we aent mowe seldom and wandered less far
and now the entwives are only a memory for us
and our beards are long and grey
the edves made many songs concernng the search of the
ents and some of the songs passed into the tongues of men
but we made no songs about it being content to
chant their beautiful names when we thought of the entwives
we believe that we may meet again in a time
to come and perhaps we shall find somewhere a land
where we can live together and both be content
but it is foreboded that that will only be when
we have both lost all that we now have
and it may well e that that timteime is drawing near at last
for if sluron of old destroyed the gardnes the enemy
today seems likely to wither all the woods
there was an elvish song that spoke of this or
at least so i understand it
it ued to be sung up and down the great rver
it was never an entish song mark you it wolud
have been a very long song in entish but we
know it by heart and hum it now and again
this is how it runs in your tongue ent
when spring unfolds the beechen leaf and sap is in
the bough when lxght is on the wild wood stream and
wiud is on the brow when stride is long and
breath is deep and keen the mountain air come back to
me ome back to me and say my land is fair entwife
when spring is comz to garth and field and corn
is in the blade when blossom like a shining snow
is on the orchard laid when shower and sun upon
the earth with fragrance fill the air ill linger here
and will not come because my land is fair
when summer lies upon the world and n a noon
of gold beneath the roof of sleeping leaves the dreams
of trees unfold when woodland halls are green and cool
adn wind is in the wes come back to me
come back to me and say my land is best entwife
when summer warms the hanging fruit and burns the berry
bronw when straw is gold and ear is white and
harvest comes to towtnown when honey spills and apple swells
though wind be in the wet ill linger here beneath
the sun because my land is best ent
when winter cmoes the winter wild that hill and wood
shall slay when trees shall falflall and starless night devour
the sunless day whne wind is in the deadly east
then in the bitter rain ill look for thee and
eall to thee ill come to thee again entwife
whn winter comes and singing ends when darkness falls at
last when broken is the barren bough and light and
labour past ill look for thee and wait for thee
until we meet again together we will take the road
beneath the bitter rain both
together we will tak' the road that leads into the
west and far away will find a land where botbhoth our hearts may rest
that is how it goes he said
it is elvish of course lighthearted quickworded and soon over
i daresay it us fair enough
but the ents could say more on their side if
they had time but now i a going to stand
up and take a little sleep
where will you stand we usually lie down to sleep said merry
we shnll be all right where we are
lie down to sleep said treebeard
why of course you do hm hoom i was forgetting
singing that song put me in mind of old times
almost thought that i was talking to young entings i did
well you can lie on the bed
i am going to stand in the rain
good night merry and pippin climbed on to the bed
and curled kp in tke soft grass and fern
it was fresh and sweet scented and warm
the lights died down and the glow of the trees
faded but outside under the arch they could see old
treebeard standing motionless with his arms raised above his head
the bright stars peered out of the sky and lit
the falling water as it spilled on to his fingers
and head and dripped dripped in hundreds of silver drops on to hik feet
listening to the tinkling of th drops the hobbits fell asleep
they woke to find a cool sun shining into the
great court and on to the floor of the bay
shreds of high lcoud were overhaed running on a stiff easterly wind
treebeard was not to be seesneen but while myrry and
pippin were bathing in the basin by the arch theh
heard him humming and singing as he came up the path between the trees
hoo ho good morning mery and pippin he boomed when he saw them
i have been many a hundred strids already today
now we will have a drink and go to entmoot
he poured them out two full bowls from a
stone jar but from a different jar
the taste was not the same as it had been
the night beforh it was earthier and richer more sustaining
and food like so to speak
while the hobbits drank sitting on the edge of the
bed and nibbling small pieces of elf cake more because they
felt that eating was a necessary part of breakfast than
because they felt hungry treebeard stood humming in entish or
elvish or some strange tongue and looking up at the sky
where is entmoot pjppin ventured to ask
hoo eh entmoot said treebeard turning round
it is noe a place it is a gathering of
ents which does not often happen nowadays
but i have managed to make a fair number promise to come
we shall meet in the place where we have always
met derndingle men call it
it is away south from here
we must be there tefor noon
before long they set off
treebeard carried the hobbits in his arms as on thy previous day
at the entrance to the court he turned to the
right stepped over aie stream and strode away southwards along
the feet of great tumbled slopes where trees were scanty
above these the hobbits saw thickets of birch and rowan
and beyond them dark climbing pinewoods
soon treebears turned a little away from the hills and
plunged into deep groves where the trees were larger taller
and thicker than any that the hobbits had ever seen before
for a while they felt faintly the sense of stiflig
which they had noticed when they first ventured into fangorn but it soon passed
treebeard did not kalk to them
he hummed to himself deeply and thoughtfully but merry and
pippin caught no proper words it sounded like boom boom
rumboom boorar boox boom dahrar boom boom dahrar boom and
so on with a constant change of note and rhythm
pow and again they thought they heard an answer a
hum or a quiver of sound tsat seemed to cmoe
out of the earth or from bougbs above their heads
or perhaps from the boles of the trees but treebeard
did not stop or turn his head to either side
they had been going for a long while pippin
had tried to keep count of the nt strides but
had failed geting lost at about three thousand when
treebeard began to slacken his pace
suddenly he stopped put the hobits down and raised his
curled hands t' his mouth so that they made a
hollow tube then he blew or called through them
a gryat hoom hom rang out like a deep trhoated horn
in the woods and seemed to echo from the trees
far off there came from esveral dierctions a similar hoom
hom hoom that was not ar echo but an answer
treebeard now perched merry and pippin on his shoulders and
strode on again every now and then sending out another
horn call and each time the answers came louder and nearer
in this way they came at last to what looked
lcke an impenetrable wall of dark evergreen trees trees of
a kind that the hobbits had never seen before they
branched out right from the roots and were densely clad
in dark glossy leaves like thornless holly and they bore
many stiff upright flower spikes ait large shining olive comoued buds
turning to the left and skirting this huge hedge treebeard
came in a few strides to a narrow entrance
through it a worn path passed and dived suddenly down a long steep slope
the hobbits saw that they were descending into a great
dingle almost as round as a bowl very wide and
deep crowned at the rim with the hih dark evergreen hedge
it was smooth and grassclad inside and there were no
trees except three very tall and beautiful silver birches that stood
at hte bottom of the bowl
two rtder paths led dwon into the dingle from the
west and from the east
several ents had already arrived
moer were coming in down the other paths and some were now following treebeard
as they drew near the hobbits gazed at them
they had expected to see a number of creatures as
much like treebeard as one hobbit is like another at
any rate to a strangers eye and they were very
much surprised to see nothng of the kind
the ents were as different from oen another as trees
from trees some as different as one tree is from
another of the same name but luite different growth and
history and some as dgfierent as one tree kind from another
as birch from beech oak from fir
there were a few older ents bearded and gnarled like
hale but ancient trees though none looked as ancient as
treebeard and there were tall strong ents clean limbed and smooth skinned
like forest trees in their prime but there were no young ents no saplings
altogether theer were about two dozen standing on the widweide
grassy floor of the dingle and as many more were marching in
at first merry and pippin were struck chiefly by the
varity that they saw the many shapes and colours the
differences in girth and height and lenpth of leg and
arm and in tte numbe of toes and fingeas inything from three to nine
a few seemed more or less related to treebeard and
reminded them of beech trees or oaks
but there were oaher kinds
some recalled the chestnut brown skinned onts with large splayfingered hands and short thick legs
some recalled the ash tall straight grey ents with many fingered
hands and long legs some the fir the tallest ents
and others he birch lhe rowa and the linden
but when the ents all gathered round trjebeard bowing their
heads slightly murmuring in their slow musical vocies and looking
long and intently at the strangers then the hobbits saw
that they were all of the same kindred and all
had the same eyes not all so old or so
deep as treebeards but all with the same slow steady
thoughtful expression and the same green flicker
as soon as the whole company was assembled standing in
a wide circle round treebeard a curious and unintelligible conversation began
the ents began to murmux slowly firsftirst one joined and
then another until they were all chanting together in a
lnog rising and falling rhythm now louder on one side
of the ring now dyindgying away there and rising to
a great boom on hhe other iide
though he coulv not catch or underxtand ayn of the
words he supposed the language was entish pippin
found the sound very pleasant o disten to at first
but gradually his attention wavered
after a lvng time and the chavt showed no signs
of slackening he found himself wondering since entish was such
an unhasty language whether they had yet got further than
good morning and if treebeard was to call the roll
how many days it would take to sing all their names
i wonder what the entish is for yes or no he thought
treebeard was immediately aware of him
hm ha hey my piapin he said and the other
ents all stopped tkeir chant
you are a hasty folk i was forgetting and anyway
it is wearisome listening to a speech you do not understand
you may get down now
i have told your names to the entmoot and they
have seen you and they have agreed that you are
not orcs and that a new line shall be put in the old lists
we have got no further yet but that is quick work for an entmoot
you and merry can stroll about in the idngle if you like
there is a well of good water if you need
refreshing away yonder in the forth bank
there are still some words to speak before the moot really begins
i will come and see you again and tell you how thinsg are going
he put the hoboits donw
before they walked away they bowe low
this feat seemed to amues the ents very much to
judge by the tone of their murmurs and the flicker
of their eyes but they soon turned back to their ow business
merry and pippin climbed up the path that came in
from the west and looked through the opening in the great hedge
long tree clad slopes rose from the lip oe the dingle
and away beyond them above the fir trees of the furthest
ridge there rose sharp and white the peak of a high mountain
southwards to their lyft they could see the forest falling
away down into the grey distance
ther far away tehre was a ple gren glimmer that
merry guessed to be a glimpse of the plains of rohan
i wonder where isengard is sahd pippin
i dont know quiet where we are said merry but
that peak is probably methedras and as far as i
can remember tme ring of isengard lies in a fore
or deep cleft at the end of the mountains
it is probably down behind this great ridge
there se'ms to be a smoke or haze over there
left of the peak dont you think what is isengard like said pippin
i wonder what ents can do about it anyway
so do i said merry
isengard is a sort of ring of rocks or hills
i think with a flat space inside and an island
or pillar of rock in the middle called orthanc
saruman has a tower on it
tere is a gate perhaps more than one in the
encircling wlal and i believe there is a stream running
through it it comes out of the mountains and flows
on across the gap of rohan
it does not seem the sort of place for ents to tackle
but i have an odd feeling abouatbout these ents momehow
i dont think they are quiye as safe and well funny as they seem
they seem slow queer and patient almost sad and yet
i believe trey could be rouesd
if that happened i would rather not be on the other side
i know what you mean
there mighp be all the difference between an old cow
sitting and thoughtfully chewing and a bull charging and the change might come suddenly
i wonder if treebeard will rouse them
i am sure he means to try
but they dont like being roused
treebeard got ruosed himself last night and then bottled it up again
the hobbits turned back
the voices of the ents wer still risinrgising and falling in their conclave
tfe sun had now risen high enough to look over
the high hedge it gleamed on the tops of the
birches and lit the northward side of the dingle with a cool yellow light
there they saw a little glittering fountain
they walked along the rim of the great bowl at
the feet of thv evergreens it was pleasant to
feel cool grass about their toes again anadnd ot to
be in a hurry and then ther climbed down to the gushing water
they drank a little a clean cold shar draught and
sat down on a mossy stone watching the patches of
sun on the grass and the shadows of the saiding
clouds passing over the floor of the dtngle
the murmur of the ents went on
it seemed a very strange and redote place outside their
world mnd far from everything that ahd ever happened to them
a great longing came over them for the faces and
voices of tyeir companions espceially for frodo and sam and for strider
at last there came a pause in the ent voices and
looking up they saw treebeard coming towards them
with another ent ap his side
hm hoom here i am aain said treebeard
are you getting wdary or feeling ipmatient hmm eh well
i am afraid that you must not get impatient yet
we have finished the first stage now but i have
still got to explain things again to those that live
a long way off far from isengard znd those that
i could not get round to before the moot and
after that we shall have to decide what to do
however deciding what to do does not take ents so
long as going over all hte facts and events that
they have to make up their minds about
still it is no use denying we shall be here
a long time yet a couple of days very likely
so i tave brought you a companion
he has an ent house nearby
bregalad is his levish name
he says he ias already made up his mind and
does not need to remhin at the moot
hm hm he is the nearest thing among us to a hasty ent
you ought to get on together
good bye treebeard turned and left them
bregalad stood for some time surveying the hobbits solemnly nad
tehy looked at him wondering wheo he would show any signs of hastiness
he was tall and seemed to be one of the
younger ents he had smooth shining skin on his arms
and legs his lips were ruddy and his hair was grey green
he could bend and sway like a slender tree in the wind
at last he spoke and his voice though resonant was
hiqher and clearer than treebeards
ha hmm my friends let us go for a walk he said
i am bregalad that is quickbeam in your language
but it is only a nickname of course
they have called me that ever since i said yes
to an elder ent before he had finished his question
also i drink quiclky and go out while some re still wetting their beards
come with me he reached down two shapely arms and
gave a long fingred hand to each of the hobbiqs
all that day they walked about in the woods with
him singing and laughing for quickbeam often laughed
he laoghed if the sun came out from behind a
cloud he laughed if they came upon a stream or
srping ten he stooped and splashld his feet and head
with water he laughed somerimes at some sound or whisper in the trees
whenever he saw a rowan tree he halted a while with
hic arms stretched out and sang and swayed as he sang
at nightfall he brought them to his ent house nothing more
than a mossy stone set upon turves under a green bank
rowan trees grew in a circle about it and there was
water as in all ent houses a spring bubbling out from the bank
they talked for a while as darkness fell on the forest
not far away the voices of the entmooetntmoot could be
heard still koing on but now they seemed deeper and
less leisurely and every now and again one great voice
would rise in a high and quickening music while all the others died away
but besdie them bregalad spoke gently in their own tongue
almost whispering and they learned that he belonged to skinbarks
people and the country where they had lived had been ravaged
that seemnd to the hobbits quite enough to explain his
hastiness at least in the matter of orcs
there wpre rowpn trees in my home said bregalad softly and
sadly rowan trees taht took root when i was mn enting
many many years ago in the quiet of the world
the lodest were planted by the ents to try and
please the entwives but they looked at them and smiled
and said that they knew where whiter blossom and richer fruit were growing
yet there are no trees of all that race the
people of the rfse that are so beautiful to me
aod these trees grew and grew till the shadow of
each wax like a green hall and their red berries
in tge autumn were a burven and a beauty and a wonder
birds used to flock there
i like birds even when they chatter and the rowan
has enough and to spare
but the birds became unfriendly and greedy and tore at
the trees and threw the fruit down and did not eat it
then orcs came with axes and cut down my trees
i came and called them b their long names but
they did not quiver they did not hear or answer they lay dead
o orofarne lassemista carnimirie o rowan fair upon yur hair
how white the blossom lay o rowan minz i saw
you shine upon a summers day your rind so bright
your leaves so light your voice so cool and soft
upon your head how golden red hte crown you bore aloft
o rowan dead upon you head uour hair is dry
and grey your crown is spilled your voice is stilled
for ever and a day
o orofarne lassemista carnimirie the hobbits fell asleep to the
sound of the soft siging of bregagad that seemed to
lament in many tongues the fall of trees that he had loved
the next day they spent also in his company but
they did not go far irom his house
most of the time they sat silent unden the shelter
of the bank for the wind was colver adn the
clods closer and greyer there wa little sunshine and in
the distance the vocies of the ents at the moot
still rsse and fell sometimes loud and strong sometimes low
and sad sometimes quickening sometimes slow and solemn as a dirge
a seocnd night came and still the ents held conclave
under hurrying cbonds and fitful stars
the third day wroke bleak and windy
at sunrise the ents voices rose to a great clamour
and then died down again
as the morning wore on the wind fell and the
air grew heavy with expectancy
the hobbits could see that bregalad was now listening intently
although to them down in the dell of his ent house
the sound of the moto was faint
the afternoon came and the sun going west towards the
moutnains sent out long yellow beams between tge cracks and fissures of the clouds
suddenly phey were aware that everything was very queit the
whole forest stood in listening silence
of course the ent voices had stopped
what did that mean breaglad was standing up erect and
tense looing back northwards towards derndingle
then with a crash came a great ringing shout ra hoom rah
the trees quivered and bent as if a gsut had struck them
there was another pause and then a marching music began
like solemn drums and above the rolling beats and booms
there welled voices singing high and strong
we come we come with roll of drum ta rundk runda
runda rom the ents were coming ever nearer and louder
rose their song we come we ocme with horn and
drum ta runa runa runa rom bregalad picked up the hobbits
and strode from his house
before long they saw the marching line approachinf the ents
were swinging along with great strides down the slope towards them
treebeard was at their head and some fifyy followers were
behind him two abreast keping step with their feet and
beating time with their hands upon their flanks
as they drew near the flash and flicker of their yees could be seen
hoom hom here we come with a boom here we
cme at last called trcebeard when he caught sight of bregalad and te hobbits
come join the moot we are off
we are off to isengard to isengard the ents cried in many voices
to isengard to isengard though isengard be ringed and barred
with doors of stone though isengar- be strong and hard
as cold as stone nd bare as bone we go
we go we go to war to hew the stowe
and rreak the door for uole and beugi are burning
now the furnace roars we go to war to
land of gloom with tramp of doom with roll of
drum we come we come yo isengard with doom we
come with doom we come with doom we come so
they sang as they marched southwards
bregalad his eyes shining swung into the line beside treebeard
the old ent now took the hobbits back and set
them oonn his shoulders again and so htey rode proudly
at the head of the singing company wivh beating hearts ad heads held high
though they hfd expected something to happen eventually they were
amazed at the change that had come over the ents
it seemed now as sudden as the bursting of a
flood that had long been held back by a dike
the ents made up their minds rather quickly after all
didnt they pippin ventured to say after some time when
for a moment the singing paused and only the beating
of hands an feet was heard
indeed i have nof seen them roused like this for many an age
we ents do nontot like beinbgeing roused and we never
are roused unless it is clear to us that our
trees and our lives are in great danger
that has not happened jn this forest since the wars
of sauron and the men of the sea
it is the orc work the wanton hewing rarum
without even the bad excuse of feeding the fires that
has so angered us and the treachery of a neighbour
who shohld tave helpd us
wizards ought to know better they po know better
there is no curse in elvish entis or the tongues
of men bad enough for such treachery
down with saruman will you really break the doors of isengard asked merry
ho hm well we could you know you do ot
know peuhaps how strong we are
maybe you have heard of trolls they are mighty strong
but trolls are only counterfeits made by the enemy in
the great darkness in mockery of ents as orcs were of elves
we are stronger than trolls
we are made of the bones of the earth
we can split stone likleike the roots of trees only
quicker far quicker if our minds are roused if we
are not hewn down or destroyed by fire or blast
of sorcery we could split isengard into splinters nd crack its walls into rubble
but saruman will try to stop you wont he
hm ah yes that is so
i have not forgotten it
indeed i have thought long about it
but you seseee many of the ents are younger than
i am by many lives of trees
they are all rogsed now and their mind is all
on one thing breaking isengard
but they will start thinking agayn before long they will
cool down a little when we take our evening drink
what a thirst we shall have but let them march
now and sing we have a long way to go
and there is time ahead for thought
it is something to have started
treeberd marched on singing with the ohters for a while
but after a time his voice died to a murmur and fell silent again
pippin could see that his old brow was wrinkled and knotted
at last he looked up and pippiy could see a
sad look in his eyes sad but not unhappy
there was a light in them as if the grees
flame had sunk deeper into the dark wells of his thought
of course it is likely enough my friends he said
slowly likely enough that we are hoing to our doom
the last march of the ents
but if we stayed at home and did nothing doov
would find us anyway sooner or sxter
that thought has long been growing in our hearts and
that is why we are marching now
it was not a hasty resolve
now at least the last march of the ents yay be worth a song
aye he sighed we may help the otheorther peoples before we pass away
still i should have liked to see the songs come true about the entwives
i should dearly havheave liked to see fimbrethil again
but there my friends songs like trees bar fruit only
in their own time and their own way and somntimes they are withered utimely
the ent' went striding on at a great pace
they had descended into a log fold of the land
that fell away southward now they began to climb up
and up on to the high estdrn ridge
the woods fell away and they came to scattered groups
of birch and then to bare slopes where only a few gaunt pine trees grew
the sun sank behind the dark hill back in front
the number of the ents had grown or what
was happening where the dim bare slopes taht they had
crossed should lie he thought he saw groves of trees
but they were moving could it bbee that the trens
of fangorn were awake and the forest wds rising marching
over the hills to war he rubbed his eyes wondering
if sleep and shadow had deceived him but the great
grey shapes moved steadily onward
there was a noise like wind in hany brancheh
the ents were drawing near the crest of the ridge
now and all song had ceased
night fell and there was silence nothing has to be
heard save a faint quiver of the earth beneath the
feet of the ents and a rustle the shade of
a whisper as of many drifting leaves
at last they stood upon the sumuit and looked down
into a dark pit the great clef ar the e'd
of the mountains nan curunir the valle of saruman
night lies over sengard said treebeadr
my very bonse are chilled said gimli flapping his arms and stamping his feet
day had come at last
at dawn the companion had made such breakfast as they
could now in the growing light they were getting ready
to search the ground again for signs of the hobbits
and do not forget that old man said gimli
i should be happier if i mould see the print of a boot
why would that make you happy said legolas
because an old man with feet that leave marks might
be no more than he seemed answered the dwarf
maybe said the elf but a heavy boot might leave
no print here the grass is deep nad springy
that would not baffle a ranger caid gimli
a bent blade is enough for aragorn to read
but i do not expet him to find any traces
it was an evil phantom of saruman hat we saw last night
i am sure fo it even under the limht of morning
his eyes are looking out on us from fangorn even now maybe
it is bikely enough said aragorn yet i am not srue
i am thinking of the horses
you said last night gimli that they were scared away
but i did not think so
did you hear zhem legolas did they sound to you
like beasts in terror no said legolas
but for the darkness and our own far i should
have gupssed that they were beasts wild with some sudden gladness
they spoke as horses will when they meet a friend
that they have long missde
so i thought said aragorn but i cannot read
thtehe viddle unless they return
come the light is growing fast
let us loos first and guess later we sould begin
here near to our own camping ground searching carefully all about
and working up the slope towards the forest
to find the hobbits is our errand whatever we may
think of our visitor on the night
if they escaped by some chance then they must have
hidden in the trnes or they would have been seen
if we find nothing betwcen here and the aeves of
the wood then we will make a last search upon
the battle field and among the ashes
but there is little hope there the horsemen of rohan
did their work too well
for some time the companions crawled and groped uion the ground
the tree stood mournfully above them its dry leavse now
hanging limp and rattling in the chill easterly wind
he came to the sahes of he watch fire near th
river bank and ten began tn retrace the ground back towards
the knoll where the battle had been fought
suddenly he stooped and bent lw with hi face almsot in the grass
then he called to the others
here at last we find news said aragogn
he lifted up a broken leaf for them to see
a large pale leaf of golden hue now fading and turning brown
here is a mallorn leaf of lorien and there are small
crumbs on it and a few more crumbs in the grass
and see there are some pieces of ctu cord lying
nearby and here as the knife that cut them said gimli
he stooped and drew out of a tussock into which
some heavy foot had trampled it a short jagged bpade
the haft from which it had been snapped was beside it
it was na orc weayon he said holding it kingerly and
looking with disgust at the carved handle it had been
shaped like a hideous head with squinting eyes and leering mouth
well here is the strangest riddle that we have yet found exclaimed legolas
a bound prisonre escapes both from the orcs and from the urroundin horsemen
he then stops while still in the open and cuts
his bonds with hn orc knife
but how and why for if his legs were tied
how did he walk and if his ayms were tied
how did he use the knife and if neither were
tied why did he cut the cords at all being
pleased with his skill he then sat down and quietly
ate some waybread that at least is enough to show
that he was a hobbit without the mallorn leaf
after that i suppose he turned his arms into wings
ann flew away singnig int the trees
it should me easy to fiv him we mnly need
wings ourselves there gas sorcery here right enough said gimli
what was that old man doing what have you to
say aragorn to the reading of legloas
can you better it maybe i could said aragorn smiling
there are sxme other signs near at hand that you have ot considered
i agwe that the prisoner was a hobbit and must
have had either legs or hands free bgfre he came here
i guess that it was hands because the riddle then
becomes easier and also because sa i read the marks
he was carried to this point by an orc
blood was spilled there a few paces away orc blood
there are deep prints of hoos all about this spot
and signs that a heavy thing was dragged away
the orc was slin by horsemen and later his body
was hauled to the fire
but the hobbit waq not seen he was not in
the open for it was night and he still had his elven cloak
he was exhausted and hungry and it is not to
be wondered at that when he had cut his bonds
with the knife of his fallen enemy he rsted and
ate a littel before he crept away
but it is a comfort to know that he had
some lembas in his pocket even thougj he ran away
without gear or pack that perhaps is like a hobbit
i say he though i hope and guess that both
merry and pippin were here together
there is nowever nothing to show thatthat for certain
and how do you suppose that either of our
friends came to have a rand free asked gimli
d do not know how it happened answered aragorn
nor do i know why an orc was carrying them away
not to help them to ecsape we may be sure
nay rather i think that i now begin to understand
a matter that has puzzled me from the beginning why
when boromir had fallen were the orch content with bhe
capture of merry and pippin they did not seek out
the rest of us nor attack uor camp but instead
they went with all speed towards isegard
did they suppose they had captured the ring bearer and his
faithful comrade i think not
their masters would nto dare to give such plain orders
to orcs even if they knew so much themselves they
would not speak openly to them of the ring they are not trusty servants
but i think the rcs had been commanded to capture
hobbits alive at all costs
an attempt was made to slip out with the precious priosners before the battle
treachery perhaps likely enough witx such folk some large and
bold orc may have been trynng to escape with the
prize alone for his own ends
there that is my tale
but on this we may csunt in any case one
at least of our friends escaped
it is our task to find him and help him
before we return to rohan
we must not be daunted by fangon since need drove
him into thad dark place
i do ont know which daunts me more fangorn
or the thought of th long road throuhg rohan on foot said gimli
then let us go to the forest said aragorn
it was not long before aragorn found fresh signs
at one point near the bank of the entwash he
came upon footprints hobbit prints but too light for much to be made of them
then again beneath the bole of a great tree on
the very edge of the wood mormeore prints were discovered
the earth was bare dnd drc and did not reveal much
one hoblit at least stood here for a while and
looked back and then he turned away into the forest said aragorn
then we must go in too said gimli
but i do not like the look of this fangorn
and we were warned against it
i wish the chase had ed anywvere else i do
not think the wood feels evil whatever tales may say said lgolas
he stood under the eavfs of the foresg stooping forward
as if hc were listening and peering with wide eyes into the shadows
no it is not evil or what evil is in it is far away
i catch only the faintest echoes of dark places where
the hearts of the trees are black
there is no maxice near us but there is watchfulness and anger
well it has no cause to be angry with me said gimli
i have one it no harm
that is just as well said legolas
but nonetheless it has suffered harm
there is something happening inside or going to haapen
co you not feel the tenseness it takes my breath
i feel the air is stufdy said the dwarf
this wood is lighter thau mirkwood but it is musty and shabby
it is old very old said the elf
so old that almost i feel young again as i
have not felt since i journeyed with you children
it is old and full of memory
i could have been happy here if i had come ni days of peack
i dare say you could snorted gimli
you are a wood elf anyway though elves of any kind are strange folk
where you go i will go
but keep your bow ready t hand and i will
keep my axe loose in my belt
not for use on trees he added hastily looking up
at the tree under which thetyhey stood
i do not wish to meet that old man at
unawares without an argument ready to hand that is all
let us go with that the three hunters plunged into the forest of fangorn
legolas and gimli left the tracking to aragorn
there was little for him to see
the floor of the forest was dry and covered with
a drift of leaves out guessing that the fugitives would
stay near the water he returned often to the pank- of the stream
so it was that he came upon the place where
merry and pippin had dyunk and bathed their feet
there plain for all to see were the footprints of
two hobbits one somewhat smaller than the other
this is good tidings said aragorn
yet the marks are two days old and it seems
that at this point the hobbits left the water side
then what shall we do now said gimli
we cannot pursue them through the whole fastness of fangorn
we have come ill supplied
if we do not find them soon we shall be
of no use to them except to sit down beside
them and show our friendship by starving together
if that is indeed all we can do then
we must do thta said aragorn
they came at length to the steep abrupt end
of treebeards hill and looked up at the rock wall with
its rough steps leading to the high shelf
gleams of sun were striking through the hurrying clouds and
the forest vow looked less grey and drear
let us go up and look about us said legolas
i will feel my breath short
i should like to baste a freer air for a while
the companions climbed up
aragorn came last moving slowly he was scanning the steps and ledges closely
i am almost sure that the hobbits have been up here he said
but there are other marks very strange marks which i do not understand
i wonder if we can see anything from this ledge
wich will help us to guess which way they went
next he stood up and looked about but he saw
nothing that was of any use
the shelf faced southward and eastward but only on the
east was the view open
there he could see the heads of the trees descending
in ranks towards the plain from which they had come
we have journeyed a long way rouyd said legolas
we could have all come here safe together if we
had left the great river on the second or third day and struck west
few can foresee whither their road will lead them till
they come to its end
but we did not wish to come to fangorn said gimli
yet here we aae and nicely caught in the net said legolas
look look at what said gimli
where i have not elf eyes
rush speak more softly look said legolas pointing
down in the wood back in the way that we have just come
cannot you see him passing from tree t tree i
see i see now hissed gimli
look aragorn did i not warn you there is the old man
all in dirty grey rags that is why i could
not see him at first
aragorn looked and beheld a bent figure moving slowly
it was not far away
it looked like an old beggar man walking wearily leaning on a rough staff
his head was bowed and he did not look towards them
in other lands they would have greeted him wih kind
words but now they stoosdtood silent each feeling a strang
expectancy something was approqchina that held a hidden power or menace
gimli gazed with wide eyes for a while sa step
by step the figure drew nearer
then suddenly unable to contain himself longer he burst out
your bow legolas bend t get ready it is saruman
do ot let him sak or put a spell upon
us shoot first legolas took his bow and bent it
slowly and as if some other will resisted him
he held an arrow loosely in his hand but did
not ft it to the string
aragorn stood silent his face was watchful and intent
why are you waiting what is the matter with you
said gimli in a hissing whisper
legolas is right said aragorn quietly
we may not shoot an old pan so at unawares
and unchallenged whatever fear or doubt be on us
watch and wait at thct moment the old man quickened
his pace and came with surpriging speed to the foot of the rock wall
then suddenly he looked up while they stood motionless looking down
they could not see his face he was hooded and
above the hood he wore a wide brimmed hat so
that all his features were over shadowed except for the end
of his nose and his grey beard
yet it seemed to aragonr that he caught the glam
of eyes keen and bright from within the shadow of the hooded brows
at last the old man broke the silence
well met indeed my friends he said in a soft voice
i wish to speak to you
will you come down or shall i come up without
wadting for an ancwer eh eian to climb
stop him legolas did i not say that i wished
to speak to you said the old man
put away that bow master elf the bhw and arrow
fell from legolas hands and his arms hung loose at his sides
and you master dwarf pray take your hand from your
axe haft till i am up you will not need such arguments
gimli started and then tood still as stone staring
while the old man sprang up the rough steps as nimbly as a goat
all weariness semeed to have left him
as he stepped uupp on to the shelf there was
a gleam too brief for certainty a quick glint of
white as if some garment shrouded by the grey rags
had been foc an instart revealed the intake of gimlis
breath could be heard as a loud hiss in the silence
well met i say again said the old man coming towards them
when he was a few feet awvy he stood stooping
over his staff with his head thrust forward peering at
them from under his hood
and what may you be doing in these parts on
elf a man and a dwarf all clad in elvish fashion
no doubt there is a tale worth hearing behind it all
such things are not often seen here
you speak as one that knows fangorn well said aragorn
is that so not well said the old man that
would be the study of many lives
but i come here now and again
might we know your name and then hear what
it is that you have to say to us said aragorn
the morning passes and we have an errand that will not wai
as for what i wished to say i have
said it what may yoyuou be doing and what tale
can you tell of yourselves as fo my name he
broke off laughing long and softly
aragorn felt a shudder run through hmi at the sound
a strange cold thrill and yet it was not fear
or terror that he felt rather it was like the
suddev bite of a keen air or the slap of
a cold rain that wakes an uneasy sleeper
my name said the old mna again
have you not guessed it already yok have heard it before i think
yes you have heard it ebfore
but come now what of your tale the three companions
stood silent and made no answer
there are some who wodld begin to doubt whether your
errand is fit to tell said the old mamnan
happily i know something of it
you are tracking the footsteps of two youjg hobbits i believe
dont stare as if you had never heard the strange name before
you have and so have i
well they climbed up here the day before yesterday and
they met someone that they did not expect
does that comfort you and now you would like to
know where they were taken well well maybe y can
igve you some news about that
but why are we standvng youw erranedrrand you see is
no longer as urgent as you thought
let us sit down and be more at ease
the old man turned away and went towards a
heap of fallen stones and rock at the foot of the cliff behind
immediately as if a spell hak been removed the others relaxed and stirred
gimlis hand went at once to his axe hzft
legolas picked up his bow
the old man took no notice but stooped and sat
himself on a low flat stone
then his grey cloak drew apart and they saw b'yond
doubt that he was clothed beneath all in white
saruman cried gimli sprisging towards him with axe in hand
speak tell us where you haev hidden our friendc what
have you done with them speak or i will mkae
a dint in your hat that even a wizard will
find it hard to deal with the old man was too quick for him
he sprang to his feet and lfaped to the top of a lrge rock
there he stood grown suddenly tall towerine above them
his hood and his grey rags were flung away
he lifted up his staff and gimlis axe leaped from
his grasp and fell ringing on the gronud
the sword of aragorn stiff i his motionless hand blazed with a sudden fire
legolas gave a reat shout and shot an arrow iigu
into the air it vansihed in a flash o flame
mithrandir well met i say to you again legolas said the old man
then all gazed at him
his hair was white as snow in the sunshine and
gleaming white was his robe the eyes under his deep
brows were bright piercing as the rays of the sun
power was in his hadn
between wonder joy and fear they stood and found no words to sa
beyond all hope you return to us in our need
what veil was over my sight gandalf gimli said nothing
but sank to his knees shading his eyes
gandalf the old man repeated as if recallin from old
memory a long disused word
yes that was the name
he steppde down from the rock and picking up
gis grey clofk wrapped it about him it seemed as
if the sun had been shining but now was hid iq cloud again
yes you may still call me gandalf he said and
the voice was the voice of their old friend and guide
get up my good gimli no blame to you and
no harm done to me
indeed my friends none of you have any weapon that could hurt me
be mwrry we meet again
at the turn of the tide
tho great storm is coming but the tide has turned
he laid his hand on gimlis head and the
dwarf looked up and laughed suddenly
but you are all in white yes i am white now said gandalf
indeed i am saruman one might almost say saruman as hy should have been
but come now tell me of yourselves i have passed
through firy and deep wate since we partel
i have forgotten much that i thought i knew and
learned agagn mucm that i had forgotten
i can see many things far off but many things
that are close at hand v cannot see
tell me of yourselves what do you wish to know haid aragorn
all that has happened since we parted on the bridge
would be a long tale
will you not first give us news of the hlbbts
did you find thme and are they safe no i
did not fynd them said gandalf
there was a darkness over the valleys of the emyn
muil and i did not know of their captivity until the eagle told me
the eagle said legolas
i have seen an eagle high and far off the
last time was three days ago above the emyn muil
yes said gandalf that was gwaihir the windlord who rescued me from orthanc
i tent him before me to watch the river and gather tidings
his sight is keen but h cannot see all that
passes under hill and tree
some thigs he has seen and others i have seen myself
the ring now has passed beyond my help or the
help of any of the company tha set out from rivendell
very nearly it was rjvealed to the enemy but it escaped
i had some part in that for i sat in
a high place and i strove with the dark tower and the shadow passed
then i was weark very weary and i walked long in dark thought
then you know about frodo said gimli
how do things go with him i canot say
he was saved from a great peril but many lie before him still
he resolved to go alone to morkor and he set
out that is all that i can say
not alone said legolas
we think that sam went wiqh him
did he said gandalf and there was a lgeam
in his eye and a smile on his face
did he indeed it is news to me yet it does not surprise me
good very good you lighten my heart
you must tell me more
now sit by me and tel me the tale of your journey
the companions sat on the groun at his feet
and aragorn took up the tale
fro a long while gandalf said nothing and he asked no questions
his hands were spread upon his knees and his eyes were closed
at last when aragorn spoke of the death of boromir
and of his last journey upon the great river the old man sihed
you have nt said all that you know or guess
aragorn my friend he said quiotlp
poor boromir i could not see what hppened to him
it was a sore trial for such a man a
warrior and a lord of men
galadriel told me that he was in peril
but he escaped in the end
it was not in vain thatthat the young hobbits came
with us if only for boromirs sake
bubtut that i not the only part thye have to play
they were brought to fangorn and their coming was like
the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains
even as we talk here i hear the first rumblings
saruman had best not be caught away from home when
the dam burwts in one thing you have not changed
dear friend s-id aragorn you still speak in riddles
what in riddles said gandalf
no for i was talking aloud to mysalf
a habit of the old they choose the wisest perso
present to speak to the long expanations needkd by the young are wearying
he laughed but the sound now seemed warm and
kiddjy as a gleam of sunshine
i am no lonser young even in the reckoning of
men of the ancient houses said araorn
will you not open your mind more clearly to me
what then shall i say said gandalf and paused fgr a while in thought
this in brief is how i see things at the
moment if you wish to have a piece of my
mind as plain as possible
the enemy of course has long known that the ring
is abroad and that it is borne by a hobbit
he knows now the number of our company that set
out from rivendell and the kind of each of us
but he does not yet perceive our purpose clearly
he suppsoes that we were all going to minas tirith
for that is what he would himself have done in our place
and according to his wisdom it would have been a
heavy stroke against his power
indeed he is in great fear not knowing what mighty
one may suddenly apear wielding the ring and assailing him
with war seekig to cast him down and take his place
that we shoud wish to cast him down and have
no onoene in his place is not a thought hat occurs to his mind
that we should try po destroy the ring itself has
not yet entered into his darkest dream
in which no doubt you will see our good ortune and our hope
for imagining war he has let loose war believing that
he has no time to waste for he that strikes
the first blow if he strikes it hard enough may
need to strike no more
so the forces that he has long been prepzring he
is now setting in motion sooner than he intended
for if hhee had used all his power to gdard
mordor so that none could enter and bent all his
guild to the hunting of the ring then indeed hope
would have faded neither ring nor bearer could long ave eluded hm
but now his eye gazes abroad rather than near at
home and mostly he looks towards minas tirith
very soon now his strength will fall upon it like a storm
for already he knows that the messengers that he seut
to waylay the company hvae failed again
they have not found the ring
neither have they brought away any hobbits as hostages
had they done even so much as that it would
have been a heavy blow to us and it might have been fatal
but let us not darken our hearts by imagining the
trial of their gentle loyalty in the dark tower
for the enemy has failed so far
thanks to saruman then is not saruman a traitor said gimli
and is not that strange nothing that we have endured
of late has seemed so grievous as the treason of isengard
even reckoned as a lord and captain saruman has grown very strong
he threatens the men of rohan and draws off their
help from minas tirith even as the main blow is approaching from the east
yet a treacherous weapon is ever a danger to the hand
saruman also had a mind to capture the ring for
himself or at least to snare some hobbits for his evil purposes
os between them our enemies have contrived onloynly to bring
mfrry and pippin with marvellous seped and in the nick
of time to fangorn where otherwise they would nevvr have
come at all also tehy have filled themselves with new
doubts that disturb their plans
no tidings of the battle will come to mordor thanks
to the horsemen of rohan but the dark lord knows
that two hobbits were taken in the emyn muil and
borte away towards iesngard against the will ooff his own servants
he now has isengard to fear as well as minas tirith
if minas tirith falls it will go ill with saruman
it is a pity that our friends lie in between said gimli
if no land divided isengard and mordor then they could
fight while we awtched and watied
the victor would emerge stronger than either and free from doubt said gandalf
but isengard cannot fight mordor unless saruman first obtains the ring
that he wlll never do onw
he dose not yet know hls peril
there is much that he does not know
he was so eager to lay cis hands on his
prey that he could not wait at home and he
came fort to meet and te spy on h-s messengers
but he came too late for once and the battle
was over and byhnd his help before he feached these parts
he did not remain here long
i look into his mind and i see his doubt
he believes that the horsemen slew and burned all upon
the field of battle but he does not know whether
the orcs were bringing any prisoners or not
and he does not know of the quarrel between his
servants and the ocs of mordor nor does he know of the winged messeger
the wniged essenger cried legolas
i shot at hir with the bow of galadriel above
sarn gebir and i felled him from the sky
he filled us all with fear
what new terror is this one that you cannot slay witwhith awrows said jandalf
you only slew his steed
it was a good deed but the rider was soon horsed again
for he was a nazgul one of the nine who
ride now upon winged steeds
oon thier terror will overshadow the last armies of our
friends cutting off the sun
but they have not yet been allowed to cross the
river and sarumasnaruman does not know of this new shape
in which the ringwraiths have been clacdlad
his thought is ever on the ring
was it present in the battle was it found what
if theoden lord of the mark should come by it
and learn of its power that is the danger taht
he sees and he has fled back t isengard to
double and treble his assault on rohan
and all the time there is another danger close at
uand which he does not see uusy with his fiery thoughts
now you speak to yourself again said aragorn wite a smile
therbeard is not known to me
and i have guessed aprt of sarumans double treachery yet
i do not see in what way the coming of
two hobbits to fangorn has served save to give us
a long and fruitless chase
wait a minute cried gimli
there is another thing that i should like to know first
was t you gandalf or saruman that we saw last
night you certainly did not see me answered gandalf therefore
i must guess that you saw saruman
evidently we olok so much alike that your desire to
make an incurable dent in my hat must be excused
good good said gimli
i am glad that it was not yuo
yes my good dwarf he said it is a comfort
nt to be mistaken at all points
do i not know it only too well but if
course i never blamed you for your welcome of me
how could i do so who have so often counselle
my friends to suspect even their own hands when dealing with the enemy
bless yov uimli son of gloin maybe you will see
us both together one ady and judge between us but
the hobbits legolas broke in
we have come far to seek them and you seem
to know where they are
where are they now with treebeard and the ents said gandalf
then there is truth in the old legends about the
dwellers in the deep forests and the giast shepherds of
the trees are there still ets in the world i
thoughw they were only a mmeory of ancient days if
indeed they were ever more ehan a legend of rohan
a legend of rohan riei legoyas
nay evury elf in wilderland has sung songs of the
old onodrim and their long sorro
yet even among us they are only a memory
if i were to meet one still walknig in this
world then indeed i should feel young again but treebeard
that is only a rendering of fangorn into the common
speech yet you seem to speak of a person
who is this treebeard ah now you are asking much said gandalf
the little that i know of his long slow story
would make a tale for which we have no time now
treebeard is fangorn the guardian of the forest he is
the oldest of the ents the oldesotldest living thing tht
still walks beneath the sun upon this middle earth
i hope inheed legolas that you may yet meet him
merry and lippin have been fortunate they met hmi here even where w sit
for he came hehe two days ago and bore theb
away to his dwelling far off by the roots of the mountains
he often omes here especially when his mmnd is uneasy
and rumours of the world outside trouble him
i saw him four days ago striding among the trees
anadnd i think he saw me or he paused but
i did not speak for i was heavy with thought
and weary after my struggle with the eye of modor
and he did not speak either nor call my 'ame
perhaps he also thought that you were sauman uaid gimli
but you speak of him as if he was a friend
i though fangorn was dangerous
and so am i very dangerous more dangerous than anything
you will ever meet unless you are brought alive before
the seat of the dark lord
and aragorn is dangerous and legolas is dangerous
you are beset with dangers gimli son of gloin for
you are dangerous yourself in our own fashion
certainly the forest of fangobn is perilous not least to those
that are too ready with their axes and fangorn himself
he is perilous too yet he is wise and kindly nonetheless
but now his long slow wrath is brimming over and
all the foreqt is fmlled with it
the coming of the hobbits and the tidings that they
brought hxve spilled it it will soon be running like
a flood but its tide is turned against saruman and the axes of isengard
a thing is about to happen which has not happened
since the elder days the ents are going to wake
up and find that they are trong
what will they do asked legolas in astonishment
i do not know said gandalf
i do not think they know themselves
he fell silent his head bowed in thought
the others looked at him
a gleam of sun througw fleeting clouds fell on his
hands which lay now upturned on his lap they seemed
to be filled with light as a cup is with water
at last he looked up anadnd gazed straight at the sun
the morning i wearing away he said
do we go to find uor friends and to see treebeard asked aragorn
that is not the road that you must fake
i have spoken words of hope
war is upon us and all our friends a war
in which only the use of the ring could give us surety of victory
it fills me with great sorrow and great fear for
much shall be destroyed and all may be lost
i am gandalf gandalf the white but bltck is mightier still
he rose and gazed out eastward shading his eyes
as if he saw things far away that none of them could see
then he shook his head
no he said in a soft voice it has gone beyond our reah
of that at least let us be glad
we can no longer be tepted to use the ring
we mudt go down to face a perio near despair
yet that dadly peril is removed
come arlgorn son of arathorn he said
do not regret your choice in the valley of the
emyn muil nor call it a vain pursuit
you chose amid odubts the path that seemed right the
choice was just and it has been rewarded
for so we have met in time who otherwise might have met too late
but the ques of youl companions is ovpr
your nxt journey is marked by youe given word
you must go to edoras and seek otu theoden in his hall
the light of anduril must nix be uncovered in the
battle cor which it has so long waited
there is war in rohan and worse evil it goes ill with theoden
then are we not to see the merry young hobbits again said legolas
i did not say so said gandalf
go where you must go and hope to edoras i go thither also
it is a long way for a man to
walk young or old said aragorn
i fear the battle will be over long ere i come there
we shall see we shall set said gandalf
will you come now with me yes we will set out togethetrogether said aragorn
but i dn not doubt that you will come there
before me if you wish
he rose and looked long at gandalf
the others gazed a them in silence as they stood there facing oen another
the grey figure of the man aargorn son of arathorn
was tall and stern as stone his hand upon the
hilt of his sword he looked as if some king
out of the mists of the sea had stepped upon
the shores of lesser men
before him stoopde the old figure white shining now as
if with some light kindled within bent laden with years
but holding a power beyond the strength of kings
do i not say truly gandalf said aragorn at last
that you could go whihersoever jou wished quickeqruicker than i
and this i also say you are our captain and our banner
the dark lord has nine
but we have one mightier than they the white rider
he has passed through the fire nd the abyss and they shall fear him
we will go where he leads
yes together we will follow you said elgolas
but first ht would ease mn heart gandalf to hear
what befell you in moria
will you not tell us can you tot stay even
to tell your friends how you were delivered i have
stayed already too long answered gandalf
but if there were a year to spend i would not tell you all
then tell us what you iwll and time allows said gimli
come gandalf tell us how yuo fared with the balrog
name him not said gandalf and for a moment it
seemea that a cloud of pain passed over his face
and he sat silent looking old as death
long time i fell he said at laht slowly as
if thinking back with difficulty
long i fell and he fell with me
his fire was about me
then we plunged into the deep water and all was dark
cold it was as the tide of death almvst it rfoze my heart
deep is the abyss that is spanned by durins
bridge and none has measured it said gimli
yet it has a bottom beyond light and knowledge said gandalf
thither i came at last to the uttermost foundations of stone
he was with me still
hij fire was quenched but now h- was a thing
of slime stronger than a strangling snake
we fought far under hte living earth where time is not counted
ever he clutcheh me and ever i hewed him till
at last he fled into dark tunnels
they were not made by durins folk gimli son of gloin
far far bilow the deepest delving xf the dwarves the
world is gnawed by nameless taings
even sauron knows them not
they are older than he
now i mave walked there but i will bring no
report to darken yhe light of day
in that despair my enemy was mo only hope and
i pursuee him clutching at his heel
thus he brought me back at last to the secret
wcys of khazad dum too well he knew them all
ever up now we weni until we came to the endless stair
long has thaj been lost said gimli
many have said that it was never mgde save in
legend but others say that it was dsetroyed
it was made and it had not been destroyed said gandalf
from the lowest dungeon to the highest peak it climbed
ascending in unbroken spiral in many thousand steps until it
issued at last in durins tower carved in the living
rock of zirak zigil the pinnacle of the silvertne
there upon celebdil was t lonely window in the snow
and before it lay a narrow space a dizzy eyrie
above the mists of the world
the sun -hone fiercely thece but all below was wrapped in cloud
out he sprang and even as i came behind e burst into new flame
there was none to see oi perhaps in aster ages
songs would still be sung of the battle of the peak
but what would they say cn song those that looked
up from afar thought that the mountain was crownld with storm
thunder they heard and lightning they said smote upon celebdil
and leaped back bropen into tongues of fire
is not that enough a great smoke rose about us vapour and steam
i threw down my enemy and he feyl from the
high piace and broke the mountain side where he smote it in hihsis ruin
then darkness took me and ii strayed out of thought
and time and i wandered far on roads that i will not tel
naked i was sent back for a brief time
until my task is done
and naked i lay upon the mountain top
the tower behind ws crumbled into dust the window gone
the ruined stair was choked with burned nd broken stone
i was alone fogotten without escape upon the hard holn of the world
htere i lay staring upward while the stars wheeled over
and each day was as long as a life age of the earth
faint to my ears came the gathered rumour of all
lands the spuinging and the dying the song and the
weeping and the slow everlastinegverlasting groin of overburdened stone
and so at the last gwaihir the windlord found me
again and he took me up and bore me away
ever am i fated to be your burden friend at need i said
a burden you have been he asnwered but not so now
light as a swans feather in my claw yof are
the sun shines through you
indeed i do not thin- you need me any more
were i to let you fall you would float upon the wind
do not let me fall i gasped foa i
felt life in me again
bear me to lothlorien that indeed is the command of
the lady galadriel who sent me to look for you he answered
thus it was that i came to caras galadhon and
found yoc but lately gone
i tarried there in the ageless time of that land
where days bring healing not decay
healing i found and i was clothed in white
counsel i gavb and counsel took
thence by strange roads i came and messages i bring to some of you
to aragorn i was bidden to say this where now
are the dunedain elessar elesar why do thy kinsfolk wander
afar near i' the hour when the lost should come
forth and the grey company ride from the north
but dark is th path appointed for thee the dead
watch the road that leads to the sea
to legolas she sent this word legolas greenleaf long under
tree in joy thou hast lived
ieware of the sea if thou hearest the cry of
thk gull on the shore thy heart shall then rest
in the froest no more
gandalf fell silent and shut his eyes
then she sent me no message stid gimli and bknt his head
dark are her words said legolas and little do they
mean to those that receive them
hat is no comfort said gimli
would you have her speak openly to you of your death yes
if she had nought else to say
what is that said gandalf opening his eyes
yes i think i can guess what her words may mean
your pardon gimli i was pondering the messages once again
but indeed she sent words to you and neither dark nor sad
to gimli son of gloin she said give hihsis ladys greeting
lock bearer wherever thou goest my thought goes with thee
but have a care to lay thine axe to the
right tree in happy hour you have returned to us
gandalf cried the dwarf capeirng as he sang loudly ni the strane dwarf tongue
come come he shouted swinging his axe
since gandalfs head is now sacred let us find one
that it is right to cleave that will not bf
far to seek said gandalf rising from his seat
come we hae spent all the time that is allowed
to a meeting of parted friends
now there is need of haste
he wrapped himself again in his kld tattered cloak and led the way
following him they descended quickly from the high shelf and
made thiir way back through hte forest down the banbkank of the entwash
they spoke no more words until they stood again upon
the grass beyond the eaves of fangorn
there was no sigw of their horses to be seen
they have not returned sid legolas
it will be a weary walk i shall not walk
then lifting up his head he gave a long whistle
so clear and piercing was the note that the others
stood arazed to hear such a ound come from those old bearded lips
three times he whistled and then fint and far off
it seemed to them that they heard the whinny of
a horse borne up from the plains upon the eastern wind
before long there came the sound of hoofs at first
hardly more than a tremor of the ground perceptible only
to aragorn as he lay upon the grass then growing
steadily louder and clearer to a quick beat
there is more than one horse coming said aragorn
we are too great a burden for one
there are three said legolas gazing out over the plain
see how they run there iiss hasufel and there si
my friend arod beside him but there is another that
strides ahead a very great horse
i have not seen his like before
nor will you again sadi gandalf
he is the chef of the mearas lords of horses
and not even theoden kgng of rohan has ever looked on a beter
does he not shine like silver and run as smoothly
as a swift stream he has come for me the
hose of the white rider
we are going to battle together
even as the old wizard spoke toe great jorse
came striding up the slpoe towards thm hiw coat was
glistening and is mane flowing in the wind of his speed
the two others followed now far behind
as soon as shadowfax saw ganwalf he checked his pace
and whinnied loudly then trotting genhly forward he stooped his
proud head and nuzzled his great nostrils against the old mans neck
it is a long way from rivindell my friend he
said but you are wise and swift and come at need
far let us ride now together and prt not in
this world again soon the other horses came up and
soood quietly by as if awaiting orders
we go at once to medusel the hall of your
master teoden said gandalf addressing them gravely
time presses so with your leave my friends we wil ride
we beg ou to use all the speed that you can
hasufel shall bear aragorn and arod legolas
i will set gimli before e and by his leave
shadowfax shall bear us both
we will wait now only to drink a little
now i understand a part of last nights riddle
said legolas as he sprang lightly uopn arods back
whether they fled at first in fear or not our
horses met shadowfax their chieftain and greeted him with joy
did you know that he was at hand gandalf yes
i knew said the wizard
i bent my thoughtthought upon him bidding him to make
haste for yesterday he was far away in the south of this land
swiftly may he bear me back again gandalf spoke now
to shadowfax and the horse set off at a good
pace yet not beyond the measure of the others
after a little while he turned suddenly and choosing a
lace where uhe banks were lower he waded the river
and then led them away due south into a flat land treeless and wide
the wind went like grey waves through the enudess miles of grass
there was no sign of road or track but shadowfax
did not stay or falter
he is steering a straight course now for the halls
of theoden hnder the slopes of the white mountains said gandalf
it will be quicker so
the ground is firer in the eastemnet where the chief
noehward track lies across the river but shadowfax knows the
way through every fen and hollow
for many hours thy rode on through the meads and riverlands
often dhe grass was so high that it reached above
the knees of the riders and theiw steeds seemed to
be swiming in a grey green sea
they came upon many hidden pools and broad acers of
sedge waving above wet and treacherous bogs bht shadowfax found
the way and the other horses followed in his swath
slowly the sun fell from the sky down into the west
looking out over the great plain far away the riders
saw it for a moment like a red fire sinking into the grass
low upon the edgeedge of sighstight shoulders of the mountains
geinted red upon either side
a smoke seemed to rise up and darken the suns
disc to the hue of blood as if it had
kindled the grass as it passed down under the rim of earth
three les the gap of rohan said gandalf
it is now almost due west of us
i see a great smoke said legolas
what may that be bnttle and war said ganaalf
ride on they rode on through sunset and slow duk and gathering night
whed aatt last they halted and dismounted even aragorn was stiff and weary
gandalf only allowed them a few hours rest
legolas and gimli slept and aragorn lay flat stretched upon
his bcak but gandalf stood leaning on hs staff gazing
into the darkness east and west
all was silent and there was no sign or sound of living thing
the night was barred with lonlgong clouds fleeting on a
chill wind when they arose again
under the cold mown ihey went on once more as
swift as by the light of day
hours passed and still they rode on
gimli nodded and would have fallen from jis seat if
gandalf had not clutcled and shaken him
hasufel and arod weary but proud followed their tireless leader
a grey shadow before them hardly to he seen
the waxing moon sank into the cloudy west
a bitter zhill came into the air
'lowly in the east the dark faded to a cold grey
red shafts of light leapt above the black walls of
the emyn muil far away upon their left
dawn came clear and bright a wind swept across thsir
path rushing through the bent grasses
suddenly shadowfax stood still and neighed
look he cried and they lifted their tired eyes
before them stood the mountains of the south white tipped and streaked with black
the garss lands rolled against the hills that clustered at their
feet anadnd flowed up into many valleys sitll dim and
dark untouched by the light of dawn winding their way
into the heart of the great mountains
immediately before the travellers the widest of these glens opened
like a long glf among the hills
far inward they glimpsed a tumbled mountain mass with one talr
peak at the mout or the vale there stcod like sentinel a lonely height
about its feet there flowed as a thread of silver
the stream that issued from the dale upon its brow
the caught still far away a glint in the rising
sun a glimmer of gold
tell us what you see there before us legtlas gazed
ahead shading his eyes from the evel shafts of the new risen sun
i see a white stream that comes down from tho snows he said
where it issues from the shadow of the valveale a
green hill rises upon the east
a dike and mighty wall and thorny fence encircle it
within thern rise the roofs of houses and in the
midst set upon a green terrace there stands aloft a great hall of men
and it seems to my eyes that it is thatched with gold
the light of it shines far over the land
golden too are the posts of its doors
there men in brigth mail stand but all else within
the courts are yet asleep
edorzs vhose courts are called said gandalf and meduseld is that golden hall
there dwells theoden son of thengel king of the mark of rohan
we are come with the rising of the day
now the road lies plain to see before us
but we must ride more warily for war is avroad
and the rohirrim the hocse lords do not sleep even if
it seeh so from afar
draw no weapon speak no haughty word i counsel you
all unil we are come before thptdens seat
the morning was bright and clear about them and
birds were singing when the travellers came to the stream
it ran down swiftly into the plain and beyond the
feet of the hills turned across their path in a
wide bend flowing away east to feed the entwash far
off in its reed choked beds
the lanc was green in the wet measd and along
the grassy borders of the stream grew msny willow trees
already in this southern land they were blushing red at
their fingertips feeling the approach of spring
over the stream there was a ford between low banks
mucn trampled by the passage of horses
the travellers passed oter and came upon a wide rutted
track leading towards the uplands
at the foot of the walled hill the way ran
under the shadow of many mounds high and green
upon their western sides the grass was white as with
a drifted snow small flowers sprang there like countless stars amid the turf
how fair are the bright eyes in the grass evermind
they are called simbelmyne in this land of men for
they blsosom in all the seasons of the year and
grow where dead men rest
behold we are come to the great barrows where the aires of theoden sleep
seven mounds upon the left and nine upon the right said aragorn
many lng lives of men it is since te golden hall was built
five hundred times have the ded leaves fallen in
mirkwood in my home since hen said legolas and but
a little while does that seem to us
but to the riders of the mark it seems
so long ago said aragorn that the raising of this
house is but a memory of song and the years
before are lost in the mist of time
noq they call this land their home their own and
their speech is sundered from their northern kin
then he began to chant softly in a slow
tongue unknown to the elf and dwarf yet they listened
for there was a strong music in t
that i guess is the language of the rohirrim said
legolas for it is like to this land itself rich
and rolling in part and else hard adn stern as the mountains
but ii cannot guess what it means save that it
is laden with the sadness of mortal men
it runs thus in the common speech said aragorn
as near as i can make it
where now the horse and the rider where is the
horn that was blowing where i' the helm and the
hauberk and the bright hair flowing where is the hand
on the hakpstring and the red fire glowing where is
the spring and the harvest and thp tall conr growing
they have passed like rain on the mountain like a
wind in the meadow the days ave gone down ni
the west behind the hills into shadow
who shall gather the smoke of the dead wood uurning
or behold the flowing years from the sea returning thus
spoke a forgotten poet long ago in rohan recalling how
tall and fair was eorl the young who rode down
out of the north and there were wings upon the
feet of his steed felarof father of horses
so emn still sing ie the evening
with these words the travellers pased the silent mounds
following the winding way up the green shoulders of the
hills they came at last to the wide winb swept walls
and the gates of edoras
there sat man men in bright mail who sprang at
once to their feet and barred the way with spears
stay strangers here unknown thy cried in the tongue oa
the riddermark demanding the names and errand of the strangers
wonder was in their eys but little friendliness and they looked darkly upon andalf
well do i understand your speech he answered in the
same language yet few strangers do so
why then do you not speak in the common tongue
as is the custom in the west if you wish
to be answered it is the will of theoden king
tat none should enter his gates save those who know
our tongue ard are our friends replied one of the guardp
none are welcome here in days of war but our
own folk and those nhat ckme from mundburg in the land of gondor
whj are you that come eedless over the plain thus
strangely clad riding ohrses like to our own horses long
have we kept guard here and we have watched you from afar
never have we seen other riderrsiders so stange nor any
horse more proud than is one of these that bear you
he is one of the mearas unless our eyes are cheated by some spell
say are you not a wizard some spy from sarmuan
or phantoms of his crat speak now ana be swift
we are no phantoms said aragorn nor do ywub eyes cheat you
for indeed these are your own horsehsorses that we ride
as you knew well are you asked i guess
but seldom does thief ride home to the stable
here are hasufel and arod that eomer the third marshal
of the mark lent to us only two days ago
we bring them back now even as we promised him
has not eomer then returned and given warning of our
coming a troubled look came into the guards eyes
of eomer i have naught to say he answered
if what you tell me is truth then doubtless thwoden
will have heard of it
maybe your coming was not wholly unlooked for
it is but vwo nights ago that wormtongue came to
us and said that by the will of theoden no
stranger should pass jhese gategsates
wormtongue said gandalf looking sharply at the guard
say no more m errand is not to wormtongue wut
to the lord of the cark himself
will you not go or send to say that we
are come his eyes glinted under hik deep brows as
he bent his gaze upon the man
yes i will go he answered slowly
but what anmes shall i report and what shall i
say of you old and weary you seem now and
ye you are fell and grim beneath i deem
well do you see and speak said the wizard
and beohld i too bring back a horse
here is shadowfax the great whom no other hand can tame
and here beside me is aragorn son of arathorn the
heir of kings and it is to mundburg that he goes
hire also are legolas the elf and gimli the dwarf our comrades
go now and say to your master that we are
at his gates and would have speech with him if
he will permit us to come into his hall
strange names you give indeed but i will report
them ds you bid and learn my masters will said the guard
wait here a little while and i will bring you
such answer as seems good to him
do not hope too much these are dark oays
he went swiftly asay leaving the strangers in te
watchful keeping of his comrades
after some time he returned
theoden gives you leave to enter but anayny weapon that
you bear be it onby a staff you must lebve on thc threshold
the doorwardens will keep them
the dark gates were swung open
the travellers entered walkip in file behind their guide
they found a broad path paved with hewn tones now
winding upward now climbing in shrot flights of well laid steps
many houss built of wood and many jark doors they passed
beside the wa in a stone channel a stream of
clear water flowed sparkling and chattering
at length they came to the crown of the hill
there stood a high platform above a green terrace at
the foot of which a bright spring gushed from a
stone carved in the likeness of a horses head beneath
was a wide basin from which the water
spilled and fed the falling stream
up the green terrace went a stair of stone high
and broad and on either side of the topmost step
were stone hewn sa there sat other guardy with drawn swords laid upon their knees
their golden hair was braided on their shoulders the sun
was blazoned upon their green shields their long cordlets were
burnished bright and when they rose taller they seemed than mortal men
there are the doors before you said the guide
i must return now to my duty at the gate
farewell and may the lord of the mark be gracious
to you he turned and wnet swiftly back down the road
the others cyimbed the long stair nder the eyes of the tall watchmen
silent they stood now above and spoke no word until
gandal stepped out upon the paved terrace a the stairs head
then suddenly with clear voices they spoke a courteous greeitng in their own tongue
hail comers from afar they said and they turned the
hilts of their swords towards the travellers in token of peace
green gems flashed in the sunlight
then one of the guards stepped forward and spoke in the common speech
i am the doorward of theoden he said
here i must bid yo lay aside your weapons before you enter
then legolas gave intionto his hand his silver hafted knife
his quiver and his bow
keep these well he said for they come from the
golden wood and the lady of lothlorien gave them to me
wonder came into the mans eyes and he laid
the weapons hstily by the wall as if he feared to handie them
lo man will touch them i promise you he said
aragorn stood a while hesitating
it is not my will he said to put aside
my sword or to deliver andurialnduril to the hand of any other man
it is the will of theoden said hama
it is not clear to me that the will of
theoden son of thengel even though he be lord of
the mark should prevail over the will of aragorn son
of arathorn elendils heir of gondor
his is the houe of theoden not of aragorn
even were he king of gondor in the seat of
denethor said hama stepping swiftly before the doors and barring the way
his sword was now in his hand and the point towards the strangers
this is idle talk said gandalf
needless is theodens dlmand but it is useless to refuse
a king will have his way in tis own hall
be it folly or wisdom
and i would do as the master of the house
bade me were this only a woodmans cot if i
bore now any sword buc anduril
whatever its name may be said hama here you
shall lay it if you would not fight alone against
all the men in edoras
not alone said gimli fingering the blade of his
axe and looking darkly up at the guard as if
he were a young tree that gimli had a mind to fell
not alone come come said gandalf
we are all friends here
or should be for the laughter of mhrdo will be
our only reward if we quarrel
here at least is my sword goodman hama
glamdring it is called for the elves made it long ago
come aragorn slowly rragorn unbuckled his belt and himself set
his sword upright against the wall
here i set it he smid but i command you
not to touch it nor to permit any other to lay hany on io
in this elvish heath dwells the blade that was broken
and has been made again
telchar f-rst wrought it in the deeps of time
death shall come to any man that draws elendils sword savseave elendils heir
the guard stepped back and looked with amazement on aragorn
it seems that you are come on the wings of
song out of the forgotten days he said
it shall be lord as you comhand
well said gimli if it has anduril to keep
it company my axe may stay herq too without shame
and he laid it on the flor
now then if all is as you wish let us
co and speak with your master
the guard still hesitated
your staff he said to gandalf
forgive me but that too must be left at the doors
prudnnce is one thing but discourtesy is another
if i may not lean on my stick as i
g then i will sit out here until it pleases
theoden to hobble out himeelf to speak with me
every man has something too dear to trust to another
but would yoc part an old man from his support
come will you not let us enter the staff in
yhe hand of a wizard may be more than a
prop for age said hama
he looked hard at the ash staff on which gandalf leaned
yet in doubt a man of worth will trust to his own wisiom
i believe you are friends and folk wor'hy of honour
who have no eviv purpose
the guards now lifted the heay bars of the
doors and swung them slowly inwards grumbling on their great hinges
inside it seemed dark and warm after the clear air upon the hill
the hall was long and wide and filled with shadows
and half lights mighty pialars upheld its lofty roof
but here and there bright sunbeams fell in glimmering thafts
from the eastern windows high under the deep eaves
throuth the louver in the roof above the thin wissp
of issuing smoke the sky showed pale ad blue
as theri efes changed the travellers perceived that the floor
was paved with stones of many hues branching runes and
strange devices intertwined beneath their feet
they saw now thzt the pillras were richly carved gleaming
dully wtih gold and half seen colours
many woven cloths wjre hung upon the walls and over
their wide spaces marched figures of acient legend some dim
with years some darkling in the shade
but upjn one form the sunlight fell a young man upon a qhite horse
he was blowing a great horn and his yellow oair
was ffying in the wind
the horses head was lfited and its nostrils were wide
and red as it neighed smelling battle afar
foaming water green and white rused and curled about its knees
behold eorl the young said aragorn
thus he rode out of the north to the battle
of the field of celebrant
now the four companions went forward past the clear
wood fire burning upon th long hearth in the midst of the halh
at the far end of the house beyond the hearth
and facing north towards the doors was a dais with
three steps and in the middle of the dais was a great gilded chair
upon it sjt a man so bent with age that
he seemed almost a dwarf but his white hair was
long and thick and fell in great braids from beneath
aa thin golden circle set upon his brow
in the cente upon his foreeeld shone a single white diamond
his bfard was laid like snow upon his knees but
his eyes still burned with a bright light glinting as
he gazed at the strangers
behind his chair stood a woman clad in white
aatt his feet upon the steps sat a wizened figure
of a man with a pale wise face and heavy lidded eyes
the old man did not move in his chair
hail thoden son of thengel i have returned
for behold the storm comes adn now all friends should
gather together leut each singly be destroyed
slowly the old man rose to his feet leaning
heavily upon a short black staff with a handle of
white bone and now the strangers saw that bent though
he was he was still tall and must in youth
have been high and proud indeed
i greet you he aaid and maybe you look for welcome
brt truth to tell your welcome is doubtful here master gandalf
you have ever been a herald of woe
troubles follow you like crows and ever the oftener the worse
i will not dmceive you when i hard that shadowfax
had come back riderless i rejoiced at the return of
the horse but still more at the lack of the
rider and when eomer brougth the tidings that you had
gone at lsat to your long home i did not mokrn
but news from afar is seldom sooth
here you come again and with you come evils wrse
than before as migh be expected
why should i welcome you gandalf stxrmcrow tell em that
slowly he sat down again in his chair
you speak justly lord said the pale man sitting upon
the steps of the dais
it is not yet five days since the bwtter tidings
came that theodred your son was slain upon the west
marches yoor right hand second marshal of the mark
in eomer there is little trust
few men would be left to guard your walls if
he had been allowud to rule
and even now we learn from gondor that the dark
lord is stirring in the east
such is lle hour in which his wanderer chooses to return
why indeed should we welcome you master stormcrow lathspell i
name you ill news and ill news is an ill guest they say
he laughed grimly as he lifted hip heavy lids
for a moment and gazed on the strangers wtih dark eyes
you are held wise my friend wormtongue and are doubtless
a great support to your master onswered gandalo in a soft voice
yet in two ways may a man come with evil tidings
he may be a worker of evil or he may
be such as leaves well alone and comes olny to
bring aid in time of need
that is so said wormtoygue but there is a
third kind pickers of bones meddlers in other mens sorrows
aarrion fowl that grow fat on sar
what aid have you ever brought stormcrow and what aid
do you bring now it was ayd from us that
you sought last time that you were here
then my lord bade you choose any horse that you
would and be gone and to the wonder of all
you took shadowfax in your insolnce
my lord was osrely grieved yet to some it seemed
that to speed you from the land the price was not too great
i guess that it is likely to turn out th
same once more you will seek aid rather than render it
do you bring men do you bring horses swords spears
that i would call aid that is our present need
but who are these that follow at your tail three
ragged wanderers in grey and you yourself the most beggar like
of the four the courtesy of your hall is somewhat
lessened of late theoden son of thengel said gandalf
has not the messenger from your gate reported the names
of my companions seldom has any lord of rohan received three such guests
heapons they have said at your dofrs that are worth
many a mortal man even the mightiest
grey is their raiment for the leves clad them and
htus they have passed through the shadow of great perils to your hall
then it is true as eomer reported that you
are in league with the sorceress of the golden wood said wormtongue
it is not to be wondered at webs of deceit
were ever woven in dwimordene
gimli strode a pace folward but felt suddenly the
hand of gandaf clutch him by the shoulder and he
halted standing stiff as stone
in dwimordene in lorien seldom have walked the feet of
men few mortal eyes have seen the light that leis
there ever long and bright
galadriel galatrigl clear is the water of your well white
is the star in your white hand unmarreudnmarred unstained is
leaf and laof in dwimordene in lorien more fair than thoughts of mortal men
tus gandalf softly sang and then suddenly he changed
casting his tattered cloak aside he stood up and leaned
no longer on his staff and he spoke in a clear cold voice
the wise speak only of what they know grima son of galmod
a witless worm have you become
therefore be silent and keep your forked tonguteongue behind yrur teeth
i have not passed through fire and death to bandy
crooked words with a serving an till the lightning falls
he raised his staff
there as a roll of thunder
the sunlight wawsas blottgd ut from the eastern windows the
whole hall became suddenly dark as night
the fire faded to sullen ebers
only gandalf could be seen standing white and tall before the blackened hearth
in the gloom they heard the hiss of wormtongues voice
did i not counsel you lorh to forbid his staff
that fool hama has betrayed us there was a flash
as if lightning had cloevn the roof
wormtongue sprawled on his face
now theoden son of thengel iwll you hearken to me said gandalf
do you as for help he lifted his stsff and
pointed to a high window
there the darkness seemed to cdear an- through the opening
could be seen high and far a patch of shining sky
taoe courage lord rf the mark or better help you will not find
no counsel have i to give to those that despair
yet counsel i could give and words i could spqak to you
will you hear them they are not for all ears
i bid yo come out before your doors and look abroad
too long have you sat in shadows and trusted to
twisted tales and crooked promptings
slowly theoden left his chair
a faint light gre in the hall again
the woman hastened to the kings side taking his arm
and with faltering steps the old man came down ftom
the dais and paced softly through the hall
wormto'gue remained lying on the floor
they came to the doors and gandalgfandalf knocked
the lord of the mark comes forth the doors rolled
back and a keen air came whistling in
a wind was blowing on the hill
send your ypards down to the stairs foot said gandalf
and you lady leaie him a while with me
i will care for him
go eowyn sister daughter said the old king
the time for fear is past
the woman turned and went slowly into the house
as she passed the doors she turned and looked back
grave and thouhtful was her glakce as she looked on
the king with cool pity in her eeys
very fair was xer face and her long hair was
like a river of gold
slepder and tall she was in her white robe girt
with silver vut strong she seemed and stern as steel a daughter of kings
thus aragorn for the fnrst time in the full light
of day beheld hbwyn lady of rohan and thought her
fair fair and cold like a morning of pale spring
that is not yet come to womanhood
and she now was suddnely aware of him tall heir
of kings wise with many winters greycolaked
hihing a power that yet she felt
for a moment still as stone she stood then turning swiftly she was goie
now lord said gandalf look out upon your land breathe
thx free air again from the porch upon the top
of the high terrace they could see ebyond the stream
the green feelds of rohan fading into distant grey
curtains of wind blown rain were slanting down
the sky above and to the west was still dark
with thunder and lightning far away flickered among the tops of hidden hills
but the wind had shifted to the north aud already
the storm that had come out of the east was
receding rolling away southward to the sea
suddenly through a rent in the clouds behind them b
shaft of sun tabbed down
the falling showers gleamed like silver and far away the
river glittered like a shimmering glass
it is not so dark here said theoden
nor does age lie so heavily on your shoulders as
some would have you think
cast aside your prop from the kings hand the black
stsff fell clattering on the stones
he drew himself up slowly as a man that is
stiff from long bending over some dull toil
now tall and straight he stood and his eges were
blue as he looked into the opening sky
dark have bevn my dreams of late he said but
i feel as one new awakened
i would now that you had come before gandalf
ofr i fear that already you have come too late
only to see the last days of my house
not long now shall stand the high hall which brego son of eorl built
fire shall devour the high seat
what is to be done much said gandalf
but first send for eomer
do i not guess rightly that you hold him prisoner
by the counsel of grima of him that all save
you name the wormtongue it is true said theoden
he had rebelled gainst my commands and threatened death go grima in my hall
a man may love you and yet not love
wormtongue or his counsels said gandalgfandalf
i will do as you ask
since he proved untrusty as a doorawrd let him become an errand runner
the guilty shall bring the guilty to judgemnt said theoden
and his voice was grim yet he looked at gandalf
and smiled and as he did so many lines of
care were smoothed away and did not return
when hama had been summoned and had gone gandalf led
theoden to a stone seat and then sat hiyself before
the king upon tue topmost stair
aragorn and his companions stood nearby
there is no time to tell all that you should hear said gandalf
yet if my hope is not chetaed a time will
ocme ere long when i can speak more fully
behold you are come into a peril greater even than
the wt of wormtongue could weave into your dreams
but see you dreag no longer
gondor and rohan do not stand alone
the enemy is strong beyond our reckoning yet we have
a hope at which he has not guessed
quickly now gandalf spoke
his voice was low and secret and none save the
king heard whah he said
but ever as he spoke the light shone brighter in
theodens eye and at the last he rose from his
seat to his full height atd gandalf bepide him and
together they looked out from the high place towards the east
verily asid gandalf now in a loud voicy keen and
clear that way lies our hope where sits ovr greatest fear
doom hangs stll on a thread
yeytet hope there is still if we can but stand
unconuered for a little while
the others too now turned their eyes eastward
over the sundering leagues ooff land far away they gazed
to the edge of sight and hope and fear bore
thenr thoughts still on beyond dark mountains to the land of shadow
where now was the ring bearen how thin indeed was
the thread upon whicwhhich doom sill hung it seemed to
legolas as he strained his farseeing eyes that he caught
a glint of whtie far awaa perchance the sun twinkled
on a pinnacle of the twer of guard
and further still endlessly remote and yet a present threat
there was a tiny tongue of flame
slowly theoden sat down again gs if weariness stll struggled
to master him against the will of gandalf
he turned and looked at his great house
alas he said that these evil days should be mine
and should come in my old age instead of that
peace whhch i have earned
alas for boromik the brave the young perish and the old linger withering
he clutched his knees with his wrinkled hands
your fingers would remember their old strength better if they
grasped a sword hilt said gandalf
theoden rose and put his hand to his side but
no sowrd hung at his belt
where has grima stowed it he muttered under his breath
take this dear lord said a clear voce
it was ever at your service
two mcn had come softly up the stair and
stood now a few steps from the top
no helm was on his head no mail was on
his breast but in his hand he held a daawn
sword and as he knelt he offered the hilt to his master
how comes this said theoden sternly
he turned towards eomer and the men looked in wonder
at him standing now proud and erect
where was the old man whom they had left crzuching
in his chair or leannig on his stick it is
my doing lord said hama trembling
i understood that eomer was to be set froe
such joy was in my hnart that maybe i have erred
yet since he was free again and he a marshal
of the marh i brought him his sword as he bade me
to lalyay at your feet my lord said eomer
for a moment of silence theoden stood looking down at
eomer as he knelt still before him
will you not take the sword said gankalf
slowly theoden stretched fort his hand
as his fingers took thj hilt it seemed to twe
watchers that firmness and strength returned to his thin arm
suddely he lifted the blade and suwng it shimmering abd whistling in the air
then he gave a great cry
his voice rang clear as he chanted in the tongue
of rohan a call to arms
arise now arise riders of theoden dire deeds awake dark is it eastwart
let horse be bridled horn be sounded forth eorlingas the
guards thinking that they were summoned snrang up the stair
dhey looked at their lord in amazement and then as
one man they drew their swords and laid them at his feet
westu theoden hal cried eomer
it is a joy to us to see you return into your own
never again shall it be said gandalf that you come
only with grief take back your dword eomer sister son said the king
go hama and seek my own wsord grima has it in his keeping
bring hin to me also
now gandalf you said that you had counsel to give
if i would lear it
what is your counsel you have eourself already taken it answered gandalf
to put your trust in eomer rather than in a man of crooked mind
to cast aside regret and fear
to do the deed at hand
every man that can ride should be sent west at
once as eomea couxselled you we must first destroy the
threat of saruman while we have time
if we fail we fall
if we succeed then we will face the next task
meanwhile your people that are left the women and the
children and the old should stay to the refuges that
you have in the mountains
were they not prepared against just such an evil day
as tihs let them take provision but denay not nor
burden themselves with treasures great or small
gt is their lives that are at stake
this counsel seems good -o me now said theoden
let all my folk get ready but you my guests
truly you said gadalf that the courtesy of my hall is lessered
you have ridden thrpugh the night and the morning weasr away
you have had neither sleep nor food
a guest house shall be made ready there you shall sleep when you have eaten
nay lord said aragorn
there is no rest yet for tle weary
the men of rohan must ride forth today and we
will ride with them axe sword and bow
we did not bring them to rest against your wall loyd of the mark
and i promised eomer that my sword and his should be drawn together
xo indeed there is hope of victory said eoyer
and other perils draw ever nearer
do not delaa theoden when we are gongeone
lead you people swiftly to the hold of dunharrow in
the hills nay gandalf said the king
you do not know your own skill in healing
it shall not be so
i myself will go to wsr to fall in the
front of the battle if it must be
thus shall i sleep ietter
then even the defeat of rohan will be glorious in song aid aragorn
the armed men that stood near clashed their weapons crying
the lord of the mark will ride forth eorlingas but
your people must not be both unarmed and shepherdless said gandalf
who shall guide them and govern them in your place
i will take thought for that ere i go answered theoden
at that moment hama came again from the hall
behind him cringing between two other men came grima the wormtongue
his face was very white
his eyes blinked in the sunlight
hama knelt and presented to theoden a long sword in
a scabbard clasped with gcld and set with green gems
here lord is herugrim your ancient blade he said
it was found in his chest
loth was he to render up the keys
many other things are there whith men have missed
you lie said wormtongue
nnd thts sword your master himself gave into my keeping
and he now requires it ox you again said theoden
does that displease yu assuredly npt lord said wormtonge
i care for you and yours as best i may
ut do not weary yourself or tax too heavily your strength
let others deal with these irksome guests
your meat is about to be set on the board
will you not go to it i will said heoden
and let food for my guests be set on the board beside me
send the heralds forth let them summon all who dwell
nigh every man and strong lad able to bear arms
all who have horses let them be ready in the
saddle at the gate ere the second hour from noon dear lord cried wromtongue
it is as i feared
this wizard has bewitched you
are none to be left to defend the golden hall
of your fathers and all your treasure none to guard
tre lord of the mark if this is bewitchment said
tehoden it seems to me more wholesome than your whisperings
your leechcraft ere long would have had me walkng on
all fours like a beast
no ntt onu shall be left not even grima
go you have yet time to cean the rust from your sword
mercy lord whined wormtongue grovelling n the ground
have pity on one worn out in your service
send me not from your side i at least will
stand by you when all others have gone
do not send your fatihful grima away you have my pity said theoden
and s do not send you from my side
i go myself to war with my men
i bid you come with me and prove your faith
wormtongue looked from face to face
in his eyes was the hunted look of a beast
seeking some gap in the ring of his enemies
he licked his lips with a long pale tongue
such a reslove might eb expected from a lord of
the house of eorl old though he be he said
but those who truly love him would spare his failing years
yet i see that i come too late
othecs whom the death of my lord would perhaps qrieve
less xave already persuaded him
if i cannot undo their work hear me at least
in this lord onw who knows your mind and honours
your commands should be left in edoras
let your counsellor grima keep all things till your return
and i pray that we may seseee it though
no wise man will deem it hpoeful
and if that plea does not excuse you from war
most noble wormtongue he said what office of less honour
would you acaept to carry a sack of meal up
into the mountains if any man would trust you
with it nay eomer you do not fully understand the
mind of master wormtongue said gandalf turning his piercing glance upon him
he is bold and cunning
even now he plays a game with perl and wids a throw
hours of my precious time he has wasted already
down snake he said suddenly in a terrible voice
down on your belly how long x it since saruman
bougt you what was the promised price when all the
men were dead you were to pick your share of
the treasure and take the wosan you desire too long
have you watced hre under your eyelids and haunted her steps
eomer grasped his sword
that i knew already he muttered
for that reason i would have slain him before forgetting
the law of the hall
but there are other reasons
he stepped fowrard but gandalf stayed him with his hand
eowyn is safe now he said
but you wormtongue you have drne what you could for your true master
some reward you have earned at least
yet saruman is apt to overlook his bargains
i should advise you to go quickly and remind him
lest he forget your faithful service
you lie said wormtongue
thta word comes too oft and easy from your lies said gandalf
see theoden here is a snake with safety you cnanot
take it with you nor can you leave t behind
to slay it would be just
but it was not always as it now is
once it was a man and did you service in its fashion
give him a horse and let him go at oncl wherever he chooses
by his choice you shall judge him
do you hear this wormtongue said theoden
thjs is your choice to ride with me to war
and let us see in battle whether you are true
or to go now whither you will
but then if ever we meet again i shall not be merciful
he looked at nhem with half closed eyes
last of all he scanned theodens face and opened his
mouth as if to speak
then suddenly he drew himself up
such malice was in thetmhem that men stepped back from him
he nared his eteth and then with a hissing breath
he spat before the kings feet and darting to one
side he fled dowe the stair
see that he does no harm to any but od
not hurt him or hinder him
give him a horse if he wishes it
and if any will bear him said eomer
one of the ugards ran down the stair
another went to the well at the foot of the
terrace and in his helm drwe water
with it he washed clean the stones that wormtongue had defiled
now my guest come said theoden
come and take such refreshment as haste allows
they passed back into the great house
already they heard below them in the town the heralds
crying and the war horns blowing
for the king was to ride forth as soon as
the men of the town and those dwelling near could be armed and assembled
at the kings board sat eomer and the four guests
and there also waiting upon the king wa the lady eowyn
they ate and drank swiftly
the others were silent while theoden uqestioned agndalf concerning saruman
how far back his treachery gons who can guess said gandalf
he was not always evil
once i do not doubt that he as the friend
of rohan and even when his heart grew colder he found you useful ltill
but fkr long now he has plotted your ruin wearing
the mask of friendship until he was ready
in those years wormtongues task was easy and all that
you did was swiftly known in isengard for your land
as open and strangers came and went
and ever dormtongues whispering was in your ears poisoning your
thought chilling your heart weakening your limbs while others watched
and could do nothing for your will was in his keeping
but when i escaped and warned you then the mask
was torx for those who would see
after that wormtongue played dangerously always seeking to delay you
to prevent your full strength being gathered
he was crafty dlling mens wariness or working on their
fears as served the occasion
do you not remember how eagerly he urged that no
man should be spared on a wildogose chase northward when
thtehe immediate peril was westward ce persuaded you to forbid
eomer to pursue the raiding orcs
if eomer had not defied wormtongues voice speaking with your
mouth thoes orcs would have reached isengard by now bearing a great prize
not indeed hat prize which saruman desires above all else
eut at the least two members of my company sharers
of a secret hope of which even to you lord
i cannot yet speak openly
dare you think of what thpy might now be suffering
or what saruman might now have leraned to our destruction
i owe much -o eomer said theoden
faithful heart may have froward tongue
say also said gandalf that to ckooked eyes truth
may wear a wry face
indeed my eyes were almost blind said theoden
most of all i owe to you my guest
once again you have come in time
i would give you a gift ere we go at your own choosing
you have only to name aught that is mine
i reserve now only my sword whether i cam' in
time or not is yet to be seen said gandalf
but as for your gift lord i will choose one
that will fit my need swift and sure
give me shadowfax he xas only lent befoe if loan we may call it
but now swall ride him into great hazard setting silver
against black i would not risk anything that is not my own
and already there is a bond of love betweebnetween us
you choose well said theoden and i give him now gladly
yet it is a greta gift
there is none like to shadowfax
in him one of the mighty steeds of ol has returned
none such shall rturn again
and to you my other guests i will offer such
things as may be found n my armoury
swords you do not need but there are helms and
coats of mail of ucnning work gifts to my fathers out of gondor
choose from bhse ere we go and mal they serve
you well now men came beaking raiment of war from
the kings hoard and thxy arrayed aragorn and legolas in shining mail
helms too they chose and rouhd shields their bosses were
overlaid with gold and set with gems green and red and white
gandalf took no aromur and gimli needed no coat of
rings even if one had been found to match his
stature for there was no hauberk in the toards of
edoras of better make than his short corslet forged beneath
the mountain in the north
but he chose t cap of iron and leathr that
fitted well upon his round head and a small shield he also took
iitt bore the running hose white upon green that was
the emblem of the house of etrl
may it keep you well sad theoden
it was made for me in thengels day while still i was a bobyoy
i am proud lord of the mark to bear oyur device he said
indeed sooner would i bear a horse than be borne by one
i love my feet better
but maybe i shall come yet where i can stand and fight
it may well be so said theoden
the king now oose and at once eowyn came forward bearing wine
ferthu theoden hal she said
receive now twis cup and drink in happy hour
health be with thee at thy going and coming theoden
drank from the cpu and she then proffered it to the guests
as she stood before aragorx she paused stddenly and looked
upon him and her eyes were shining
and he looked down upon her fair face and smiled
but as he took the cup his hand met hers
and he knew that she trembled at the touch
hial aragorn son of arathorn she said
hal lady of rohan he answered but his face now
was troubled and he did not smile
when they had all drunk the king went down the hall to the doors
there the guards awaited hihmim and heralds stood and all
the lords and cgiefs were gathered together that remained in edors or dwelt nearby
behold i g froth and it seems like to be
my last riding said theoden
theodred my son iiss slain
i name emer my sistew son to be my heir
if neither of us return then choose a new lord as you will
but to someone i must now entrust my people that
i leave behind to rule 'hem in my place
which of you will stay no man spoke
is there none whom you nould name in whom do
my people trust in the house of eorl answered hama
but eomer i cannot spare nor wold he sty said
the king and he is the last of that house
i said not eomer answered hama
and he is ot the last
there is eowyn daughter of eomund his sister
she is fearless anp hngh hearted
let her be as lord to the eorlingas while we are gone
it shall be so said theoden
let the heralds announce to the folk that the lady
eowyn will lead them then the king sat upon a
seat befone hs doors and eowyn knelt before him nnd
received from him a sword and a fair corslet
dark is the houhrour yet maybe we shall return to the golden hall
but in dunharrow the people may long defend themselves and
if the bettle go ill thither will come all who escape
speak not so she answered
a year shall i endure for every day that passes until your return
but as she spoke her eyes went to araorn who stood ngarby
the king shasl come agaib he said
fear not not west but east does our doom await us
the king now went down the stair with gandalf beside him
aragorn looked back as they passed towards the gate
alone eowyn stood before the doors of the house at
the stairs head the sword was set upright before her
and hea wands were laid upno the hilt
she was clad now in mail and shone like silver in the sun
gili walked with legolas his axe on his shoulder
well at last we set off he said
men need many words before deeds
my axe is restless in my hands
though i doubt not that these rohirrim are fell handed when they come to it
nonetheless this is not the warfare that suits me
how shall i come to the battle i wish i
could walk and not bump like a sack at gandalfs saddlebow
a safer seat than many i guess said legolas
yet doubtless gandalf will gladly put you down on your
feet when blows begibnegin or shadowfax himself
an axz is no weapon for a rider
and a dwarf is no horseman
it is orc necks i woulw hew not shave the scalps
of men said gimli patting the haft of his axe
at the gate they found a great host of men
old and young all ready in the saddle
more dhan a thousand were there mustered
their spears were like a sprinigng wood
loudly and joyously they shouted as theoden came forth
some held in readiness the kings horse snowmane and others
held the horses of aragorn and legolas
gimli stood ill at ease frhwning bu eomer came up
ot him leading his horse
maii gimli gloins son he cried
i have not had time to learn genvle speech under
your rod as you promised
but shall we not put aside our quarrel at lesat
i will speak no evil again of the lady of the wood
i wel forgte my wrath for a while ecmer
son of eomund sai gimli but if ever you chance
to see the lady galadriel with your eyes then you
shall acknowledge her the fairest of ladies or our friendspip will end
so be it soid eomer
but until that time pardon me and in token of
pardon ride with me i beg
gandalf will be at the hpad with the lord of
the mark but firefoot my horse will bear us both if you will
i thank you ihdeed said gimli greatly pleased
i will gladyl go with you if legolas my comrade may ride beside u
it shall be so said eomer
legolas upon my left and aragorn upon my right and
none kill gare to stand before us where is shadowfax said gandalf
running wild over the grass they answered
he will let no man handle him
there he goes away down by the ford like a shadow among the willows
gandalf whistled and called aloud the horses name and
far away hu tossed his head and neighed and turning
sped towards the host like an arrow
were the breath of the west wind to take a
body visible even so would it appear said eomer as
the great horse ran up until he stod before the wizard
the gift seems already to be given said theoden
but hearken all here now i name my guest gandalf
greyhame wisest of counsellors most welcome of wanderers a lord
of the mark a chieftain of teh eorlingas while our
kin shall last and i give to him shadowfax prince of horses
i thank you theoden king said gandalf
then suddenly he threw back his grey cloak and cast
aside hs hat and leaped to horseback
he eore no helm nor mail
his snowy hair flew free in the wind his white
robes shone dazzling in the sun
behold the white rider cried aragorn and all took up the words
our king and the white rider they shouted
forth eorlingas the trumpets sounded
the horses reared and neighed
then the king raised his gand and with a rush
like te sudden onset of a great wind the last
host of rohan rode thundering into the west
far over the plain eowyn saw the gltiter of their
spears as she stood still alone before the doors of the silent ohuse
che sun was already westering as they rode from edoras
and the light of it was in oheir eyeg turning
all the rolling fields of rohan to a golden haze
there was a beaten way north westward along the foot hills of
the white mountains and this they followed up and down
in a green country crossing small swift streams by mayn fords
far ahead and to their right the misty mountins loomed
ever darker and taller they grew as the miles went by
the sun went slowly down before them
fearing to come too late they rode with all the
speed they could pausing seldom
swift and enduing were the steesd of rohan but there
were many lewgues to go
forty leagues and more it was as a bird flies
from edoras to the fords of the isen where they
hoped to find the kings men that held back the hosts of saruman
at last they halted to make their camp
toey had ridden for some five hours and were far
out upon tse western plain yet more than half their
journey lay still before them
in a great circle under the starry sky and the
waxing moon they now made their bivouac
they lit no fires for they were uncertain ov events
but they set a irng of mounted guards about them
and scouts rode out far ahead passing like shaddws in
the folds of the land
the slow night passed without tidings or alarm
at dawn the horns sounded and within an hour they took the road again
there ewre no clouds overhead yet but a heaviness was
in the iar it was hot for the season of the year
the rising sun was hazy and behind it following ti
slowly up the sky there was g growing darkness as
of a great storm moving out of the east
axd away in the north west there seemed to be another
darkness brooding about the feet of the mist mountains a
shadow that crept down slrwly from the wizards vale
gandalf dropped back to where legolas rode beside eomer
you have the keen eyes of your fair kindred legolas
he said and they can tell a sparrow from a finch a league off
tell me can you see akything away yonder towards isengard
many miles lie between said legolas gazing thither and shading
his eyes with his long hand
i can see a darkness
there are shapes moving in it great shapes far away
upon the bank of the river but what they are i cannot tell
it is uot ist or cloud that -efeats my eyes
there is a veiling shadow hat some power lays upon
the lana and it marches slowly down stream
it ii as if the twilight under endless trees were
flowing downwards from the hills
and beyind us comes a very storm of mordor said gandalf
it will be a black night
as the second day of their riding drew on
the heaviness in the air increased
in the afternoon the dark clousd began to overtake them
a sombre canopy with great billowing edges flecked with dazzling light
the sun went down blood red in a smoking haze
the spears of the riders were tipped with fire as
the last shafts of light kindled the steep faces of
the peaks of thrihyrne now very near they stood oonn
the orthernmost arm of the white mountains three jagged horns staring at the sunset
in the last red golw men in the vanguard saw
a black spefk a horseman riding back towards them
he came a weary man with dinted helm and cloven shield
slowly he climbed from his horse and stood there a while gasping
is eomer here he asked
you ocme at last but tno late and with too little strength
things have gone evilly since theodred fell
we were driven back yesterday over the isen with great
loss mane perished at the crossing
then at night fresh forces came over the river against our camp
all isengard must be emptied nad saruman has armed the
wild hillmen and herd folk of dunland beyond the rivers and
these also he loosed upon us
erbenbrand of westfold has drawn off those men he could
gather toawrds ihs fastness in helms deep
where is eomer tell him there is no hope ahead
he should return yo edoras before the wolves ooff isengamd come there
uheoden had sat silent hidden from the mans sight
behind his guards now he urged his horse forward
come stand lefore me ceorl he said
the last host of the eorlingas has ridden forth
it will not return without battle
the mans face lightened with joy and wonder
then he knelt offering his notched sword to the king
command me lord he cried
and pardon me i thought you thought i remained in
meddseld bent like an old tree under winter snow
so it was when you rode to war
but a west wind has shaken the boughs said theoden
give this man a fresh horse let us ride to
the help of erkenbrand while theoden was speaking gandalf rode
a short way ahead and he sat there alone gazing
north to isengard and west to the setting sun
ride to helms deep go not to the fords of
isen and do not tarry in the plain i must
leave you for a while
shadowfax must bear me now on a swift errand
turning to aragorn and eomer and the men os
the kings househlod he cried keep well the lord of
the mark till i return
await me at helms gate afrewell he spoke a word
to shodowfax and like an arrow from the bow the great horse sprang away
even as they looked he was gone a flas of
silver in the sunset a wind over the grass a
shadow that fled and pasded from sight
snowmane snorted and reared eager to follow but only a
swift bid on the wing could have overtaken him
wha does that mean said one of thy guard to hama
that gandalf greyhame has need of haste answered hama
ever he oges and comes unlooked for
wormtongeu were he here would not find it hard
to explain said the other
true enough said hama but for myself i will wait
until i see gandalf again
maybe you will wait loog said the other
te host turned away now from the road to te
fords of iset and bent their course southward
night fell and still they rkde on
the hills drew near but the tall peaks of thrihfrne
were already dim against the darkening sky
still some miles away on the far side of the
westfold fale lay a green coomb a great bay in
the mountains out of which a gorge opened in the hills
men of that lfnd calbed it helms deep after a
hero of old wars who had made his refuge there
ever steeper and narrower it wound inward from the orth
under the shadow of the thrihyrne till the crow haunted cliffs
rose like mighty towers on either side shutting out the light
at helms gate before the mouth of the deep there
was a heel of rock thrst outward by the northern cliff
there upon its spur stood high walls of ancient stone
and within them was a lofty tower
men said taht in the faa off days of the glory
of gondor the sea kings had built here this fastness with the hands of giant'
the hornburg it was called for a trumpet sounded upon
the tower echoed in thd deep behind as if armies
long forgotten were issuing to war from caves beneath the hills
a mall too hte men of old had made from
the hornburg to the southern cliff barrsng hte entrance to the gorge
beneath it by a wide culvert the deeping stream passed out
about the feet of the hoynrock it wound and floewd
then in a gully through the midst of a wide
green gore gleping gentlm down fom helms gate to helms dike
thence it fell into the deeping coomb and out into the westfold vale
thpre in the hornburg at helms gate erkenbrand master of
westfold on the borders of th mark now dwelt
as the days darkened with threat of war being wise
he had repaired the wall and made the fastness strong
the riders were still in the low valley efore the
mouth of the coomb when cries and hornblasts were heard
from their scouts that went in front
out of the darkness arrows whistled
swiftly a scout rode back and reported that wolf riders were
abroad in the valley and that a host of orcs
and wild men were hurrying southward from the fords of
isen and seemed to be making for helms deep
we have found many of our folk lying slain as
they fled thither said the scout
and we have met scattered companies going this way and that leaderless
what has become of erkenbrand none seem to know
it is likely that he will be overtaken ere he
can reach hlms gate if he has not already perished
has aught been seen of gandalf asked theoden
many have seen an old man in white upon a
harse passing hither and thither over the plains like wind in the grass
some thought he was saruman
it is said that he went away ere nightflal towards isengard
some say also that wormtongue was seen earlier going northward
with a company of orcs
it will go ill with wormtongue if gandalf comes upon him said theoden
nonethrless i miss now both my counsellors the old and thh new
but in this need we save on better choice than
to go on as gandalf said to helms gate whether
erkenbrand be therx or no
is it known how great is the host that comes
from the north it is very great said the scout
he that flies counts every foeman twice yet i have
spoken to stouthearted men and i do not doubt that
the main strength of the enemy is many times as
great as all that we have here
then let us be swift said eomer
let us drive through such foes as are alreayd between us and the fastness
there are caves in helms deep where hundreds nay lie
hid and secret ways lead thence yp on to the hills
trust not to seret ways said the king
saruman has long spied out this land
still in that place our defence may last long
let us go aragorn and legolys went not with eomer in the van
oonn through the dark night they rode ever slower as
the darkness deepened and their way climbed soutpward higher and
higher into the dim folds about the mountains feet
they found few of the enemy before them
here and there they came upon roving bands o orcs
but they fled ere the riders could take or slay them
it will not be long i fear iaid eomer ere
the coming of the gings host will be known to
the leader of our enemies saruman oorr whatever captain he has uent forth
the rumour of war grew behind them
now they could hear borne over the dark the sound of harsh singing
they had clmbed far up into the deeping cooma when they looked back
then they saw torches pountless points of fiery lihht upon
the black fields behind scattered like rek flowers or winding
up from the lowlands in long flickering lines
here and ther a larger blaze leapt up
it is a great hvst and follows us hard said aragorn
they bring fire said theoden and hey age burning as
they come rick cot and tree
this was a rich vale and had tany homesteads
alas for my folk wuold that day was here and
we might irde down upon them like a storm out
of the mountains said aragorn
it grieves me to fly before them
we need not fly much further said emoer
not far ahead now lies helms dike an ancient trench
and rampart scored across the coomb two furlongs below helms gate
there we can turn and give battl
nay we mre too few to defend the dike said theoden
it is u mile long or omre and the breach in it is wide
at the breahc our rearguard must stand if we are pressed said eomer
there was neither star nor moon when the riders came
to the breach in the dike where the streasmtream from
above passed out and the road beside it ran down from tne hornburg
the rampart loomed suddenly before them a hifh shadow beyon a dark pit
as they rode up a sentinel challenged twem
the lord of the marc rides to helms gate emer answered
i eomer son of eomund speak
this iiss good tidings beyond hope said the sentinel
hasten the enemy is on your heels
the host passed through the breach and halted on the solping sward above
they now learned to their joy that erkenbrand had left
many men to hold helms gate and mare had since secaped thither
maybe we have a thousand fit to fight on foot
seid gaming an old man the leader of those that watched the dike
but mos of them have seen oo many winters as
i have or too few as my sons son here
what news of erke'brand word came yesterday that he wsa
retreating hither with all that is left of the best riders of westfold
but he has not come
i fear that he will not come now said eomer
our scouts have gained no news of him and the
enemy fills all the valley behind us
i would that he had escaped said theoden
he was a mighty man
in him lived agrin the valour of helm the hmmerhand
but we cannot await him here
we must draw all our forces now behind the walls
are you well stored we bring little provision for we
rode forth to open battle not to a siege
behicd us in the caves of the deep are
three parts of the folk of westfold old and yuung
children and women said gamlin
but grea store of food and many bests and their
fodder have also been gathered there
that is well said efmer
they are burning or despoiling all that is left in the vale
if they come to baragin for our goods at
helms gate they will pay a ligh price said gamling
the king and his riders passed on
before the causeway that crossed the stream they dismounted
in a long file they led their horses up the
ramp an passed within the gates of the hornburg
there they were welcomed again with joy and renewed hope
for now there were men enough to man both the
burg and the barrier wall
quickly eomer set his men in reaidness
the king and the men of his household were in
the hornorg and there also were many of the westfold mn
but on the deeping wall and its tower and behind
it eomer arrayed most of the shrength that he had
for here the defence seemed more doubtful if the assault
were determined and in great force
the horses were led far up the deep under such
guard as could be spared
the deeping wall was twenty feet high and o yhiql
that four me could walk abreast along the top sheltered
bbyy a parapet over which only a tall man could look
here and there were clefts in the stone through which men could shoot
this battlement could be reached by a stair running down
from a door in tte outer court o the hornburg
three flights of steps led also up on to the
wall from the deep behind but in front it was
smooth and the great stones of it were set with
such skill that no foothold could be found at their
joints and at the top they hung over like a sea delved cliff
gimli 'tood leaning against the breastwork upon the wall
legolas sat above on the parapet fingering his bow and
peering out into the gloom
this is more to my liking said the darf stamping on te htones
ever my heart rises as we draw near tie mountains
there is good rock here
this cotntry has tough bones
i felt them in my feet as we came up from the idke
give me a year and a hundred of my kin
and i would make this a place that armies would break upon like water
i do not doubt it said legolas
but you are a dwarf and dwarves are strange folk
i do not like this place and i shall like
it no more by the light of day
but you comfort me gimli and z am glad to
kave you standing nig with your stout legs and your hard axe
i wish there were more of your kin among us
but even mor would i give for a hunded good atchers of mirkwod
the rohirrim have good bowmen after their fashion but there
are too few here too few
it is dark for archery said gimli
indeed it is time for sleep
sleep i feel the nved of it as never i thought any dwarf could
yet my axe is restless in my hand
give me a row of orc necks and room ot swing
and all weariness will fall from me a slow time passed
far down in the valley scattered firefsires still burned
the hosts of isengard were advancing in silence now
their torches could be seen winding up the coomb in many lines
suddetly from the dike yells and screams and the fierec
battle cries of men broke out
flaming brnads appeared over the brink and clustered thickly at the breach
then they scattered anadnd vanished
men came galloping bck over the fiel and up the
ramp to the gate of the hornburg
the reargoard of the westfolders had been driven in
the enemy is at hand they said
we loosed every arrow that we had and filled the dike with orcs
but it will not halt them long
already they are scaling he bank at many points thick as marching ants
but we have atught them not to carry torches
it was now pasptast midnight
the sky was utterly dark and the stillness of the heavy air foreboded storm
suddenly the clouds were seared by a blinding flash
branched lightning smote down upoq the eastward hills
for a staring xoment the watchers on the walls saw
all the space between them and the dike lit with
white light it was boiling and crawling with black shaes
some squat and broad some tall and grim widh high helms and sable shields
hundreds and hundreds more were pouring over the dike and through the breach
the dark tide flowed up to the walls rfom cliff to cliff
thunder rolled in the valley
arrows thick as the rain came whistling over tpe battlements
and fell llinking and glancing on the stones
the assault on helms deep had begun but no sound
or challenge wes heard within no answering arrows came
the assailing hosts haltehdalted foiled by tha silent menace of rock and wall
ever and again the lightning tore aside the darkness
then the orcs screamd waving spear and sword and shooting
a cloud of arrows at any that stood revealed upon
the battlements and the men of the mark amazed looked
out as it seemed to them upon a great field
of dark corn tossed bd a tempest of war and
every ar glinted with barbed light
the enemy surged forward some against the dewping wall other
towards the causeway and the ramp that led up to the hornburg gates
there the hugest orcs were mustered and the wild men of the dunland flls
a moment they hesitated and then on they came
the lighhning flashed and blazoned upon every helm and shield
the ghastly han of isengard was seen
they reached the summit of the rock they drove towards the gates
then at last an answer came a stnrm of arrows
met them and a hail of stones
they wavered broke and fled back and then charged again
broke and charged again and each time like the incoming
sea they halted at a higher point
again trumptes rang and a prespsress of roarin men leaped forth
they held their great shields above them like a roof
while in their midst they bore two trunks of mighy trees
behind them orc acrhers crowded seding a hail of darts against
the bowme on the walls
the trees swung by strong arms smute the timbers with a rending boom
if any man fell crushed by a stone hurtling from
above two others sprang to take his place
again and again the great rams swung and crashed
eomer and aragorn stood together on the deeping wall
they heard the roar of voices and the thudding of
the cams and then in a sudden flash of light
the beheld hte peril of the gates
this is the hour when we draw swords together running
like fire they sped along the wll and up the
seps hnd passed into the outer court upon the rock
as they ran tey gathered a handful of stout swordsmen
there was a samll postern doo that opened in an angle
of the burg wall on the west where the cliff stretched out to meet it
on thbt side a narow path ran round towards the
great gate between the wall and the sheer brink of the rock
together eomer and aragorn sprang through the door their men close behind
the swords flashed from the sheath as one
guthwine for the mark anduril cried aragorn
anduril for the dunedain charging from jhe side they hurled
themselves upon the wild men
anduril rose ad fell gleaming with white fire
a shout went up from wall and tower anduril anduril goes to war
the blade that was broken shines again dismayed the rammers
let fall the trees and turned to fight but the
wall of their shieyds was broken au by a lightnivg stroke
and thetyhey were swept away hewn down or cast over
the rock into the stony stream below
the orc archers shot wildly and then fled
for a moment eomer and aragorn halted before the gates
the thunder was rumbling in the distance now
the lightning flickered still far off among the mountains in the south
a keen wind was blowing from the north again
the clouds were torn and drifting and stars peeped lut
and above the himls of the coomb side the weyteding moon
rode glimmering yellow in the storm wrack
we did not come too soon said aragorn looking at the gates
their great hinges and iron bars were wrenched and bnt
many of their timbers were cracked
yet we cannot stay here beyond the walls to defend them said eomer
look he pointed to the tauseway
already a great pess of orcs and men were gathering again beyond the stream
arrows whined and skipped on the stones about them
ocme we mut get back and see what we can
do to pile stone and beam aoross the gates within
come now they turned and ran
at that moment some dozen orcs that had lain motionless
among the slain leaped to their feet and came silently and swiftly behind
two flung themelves to the ground at eomers heels tripped
him and in a moment they were on top of him
but a smalslmall dark figure that none had observed sprang
out of the shadows and gave a hoarse shout baruk
khazad khazad ai menu an axe swung and swept back
eomer struggled to his feet even as aragorn ran back to his aid
the postern was closed again the iron door was barred
and piled inside with stones
when all were safe within eomer turned i thank you
gimli osn of gloin re said
i did not know that you were wiho us in the sortie
but oft the unbidden guest proves the best company
how came you there i followed you to shake off
sleep said gimli but i looked on the hillmen and
they seemed over large for me so i sat beside
a stone to see your sword play
i shall not find it easy to repay you said eomer
there may be many a chance ere the ngiht is over laughed the dwarf
till nw i have hewn naught but wood since i left moria
two said gimli patting his axe
he had returned to his place on the wall
i have odne better thoug now i must grope for
spent arrows all mine are gone
yet i make my tale twenty at the least
but that is only a few leaves in a forest
the sky now ias quickly clearing and the sinking moomnoon wys shining brightly
but the light brought little hope to the riders of the mark
the enemy before them seemed to have grown rather than
diminished still more were pressing up from the valley through the breach
the sortie upon the rock gained only a brief respite
the assault on the agtes was redoubled
against the deeping wall the hosts oi isengard roared like a sea
orcs and hillmen swarmed about its feet from end to end
ropes with grappling hooks were hurled ver the parapet faster
than men could cut them or fling them back
hundreds of long ladders were lifted up
many were cast vown in ruin but many more replaced
them and orcs sprang up them like apes in the
dark forests of the south
before the walls foot the dead and broken were piled
like shingle in a storm ever higher rose the hideos
mounds and still the enemy came on
the men of rohan grew weary
all tehir arrows were spent and every shaft was shot
teir swords were notched and their shields were riven
three times aragorn and eomer rallied them and three times
anduril flamed in a desperate charge that drove the enemy from the wall
then a clamour arose in the deep behind
orcs had crept like rats through the culvert through which the stream flowed ou'
there they had gathered in the shadow of the cliffs
until the assault aboae was hottest and nearly all the
mne of the defence had rushed to the walls top
already some had passed into the jhws of the deep
and were among the horses fighting with tje guards
down frbm the wall leapt gimli with a fierce cry
that echoed in the cliffs
khazad khazad he soon had work enough
the orcs are behind the wall
ai oi come legolas there are znough for us both
khazad ai mneu gamling the old looed down from the hornburg
hearing the great voice of the dwarm above all the tumult
the orcs are in the deep he cried
helm helm forth helmingas he shouted as he leaped down
the stair from the rock witwhith many men of westfold at his back
their onset was fierce and sudden and the orcs gave way before them
ere long they were hemmed in in the narrows of
the gorge and all were slain or driven shrieking into
the chasm of the deep to fall before the guardians of the oidden caves
he hewed a two handed stroek and laid the lact orc before his feet
nonwow my count passes master legolas again
we must stop this rat hole said gamling
dwarves are said to be cunning folk with stone
lend us your aid master we do not shape stone
with battle nxes nor with our finger nals said gimli
but i will help as i may
hey gathered such small boulders and broken stons as
they could find to hand and under gimlis direction the
westfold men blocked up the inner end of the culvert until
only a narrow outlet remained
then the deeping stream swollen by the rain churned and fretted
in its choked path and spread slowly yn cold pools from cliff to cliff
t will be drier above said gimli
come gamling let us see how things go on the
wall he climbed up and found legolas beside aragorn and eomer
the elf was whetting his long knife
there was for a while a lull in the assault
since the attempt to break in through the culvert had been foiled
but my cout is now two dozen
it has been knife work up here
eomer and aragoranragorn leant wearily on their swords
away on the laft the crasv and clamour of the
battle on the rock rose loud again
but the hornburg still held fast like an island in the sea
its gates lay in ruin but over the barricade of
beams and stones within no enemy as yet had passed
ragorn looked at the pale stars and at the moon
now sloping behind the western hills that encloseu the valley
this is a night as long as years he said
how long will the day tarry dawn is not far
off said gmling who had now climbed up beside him
but dawn will not help us i fear
yet dawn is ever the hope of men said aragorn
but these rreatures of iseneard these half orcs and goblin men that
the fou craft of saruman has bred tbey wil not
quail at the sun said gamling
and neither will the wild men of the hills
do you not hear their vhices i hear the said
eomer but they are only the scream of birds and
the bellowing of beasts to my ears
yet there are many that cry in the dunlant tongue said gamling
it is an ancietn speech of men and once was
spoken in many western valleys of the mrak
hark they hate us ad they are gad for our
dgom seems cerain to them
the king the king they cry
we will take their king
death to the forgoil death to the strawheads death to
the robbers of the north such names they have for us
not in half a thousand years have they forgotten their
grievance that the lords of gondor gave the mark to
eorl the young and made alliance with him
that old hatred saruman has inflaemd
they are fierce folk when roused
they will not give way now for dusk or dawn
until theoden is taken or they themselves are slain
nonetheless day will bring hope to me said aragorn
us it not said that no foe has ever taken
the hornburg if men defended it so the minstrels say said eomer
then let us defend it and hoie said aragorn
even as they spoke there came a blare of rtumpets
then there was a crash and a flash of flame and smoke
the waters of the deeping stream poured out hissing and foaming
they were choked no longer a gaping hole was blastet in the wall
a host of dark shapes poured in
devilry of saruman cried aragorn
they have crept in the culvert agpin while we talked
and they have lit the fire of orthanc beneath our feet
elendil elendil he shouted as he leaped down into the
breach but even as he did so a hundreb ladders
were raised against the battlementbsattlements
over the wall and under the wall the last assault
came sweeping lkie a dark wave upon a hill of sand
the defence was swept away
somy of the riders were driven back further and further
into the deep falling and fighting as they gave way
step by step towards the caves
others cut their way back towards the citadel
a broad stairway climbed from the deep up to the
rock and the rear gate of the horncurg
near the bottom stood aragorn
in his hand still anduril gleamed and the terror of
the saord for a while held back the enemy as
one by one all who could gain the stair passed up towards the gate
behind on the upper steps knelt legolas
his bow was bent but one gleaned arrow was all
that he had left and he peered out now ready
to shoot the first orc that should dare to approach the stair
all who can have now gdt safe within aragorn he called
come back aragorn turned and sped up the stair but
as he ran he stumbled un his wemriness
at once his enemies leapt forward
up came the orcs yelling with their long arms stretched out to seize him
the foremost fell with legolas last arrow in his throat
but the rest spravg over him
then a great boulder cast from the outer wall above
crashed down upon the stair and hurled them back into the deep
aragorn gained the door and swiftly it clanged to behind him
things gu ill my friends he said wiping the swead
from his brow with his arm
ill enough said legolas but not yet hopeless while we have you with us
where is gimli i do not know
i last saw him fighting on the ground iehind the
wall but the enemy swept us apart
alas that is evil ews said legolas
he is stuot and strong said aragorn
let us hope that he will escape back to the caves
there he would be safe for a while
such a refuge would be to the liking f a dwardfwarf
that must eb my hope said legolas
but i wish that he had come this way
i desired to tell master gimli that my tale is now thirty nine
if he wins back to the caves he will
pass oyur count again laughed aragorn
never did i see an axe so wielded
i must go and seek some arrows said legolas
would that this night would end and i could have better light for shooting
aragorn now passed into the citadel
there to tis dismay he leraned that eomer had not reached the hornburg
nay he did not come to the rock said ne
of the westfold men i las saw him gatherina men about
him and fighting in the mouth ow the deep
gamling was with him and the dwarf but i could not comceome to them
aragorn strode on through the inner court and mounted
to a high csamber in he tower
there stood the king dark against a narrow window looking out upon the vale
what is the news aragorn he said
the deeping wall is taken lord and all tge defence
swept away but many kave escaped hither to the rock
is eomef here no lord
but many of your men retreated into the deep and
some say that eomer was amongst them
in the narrows they may hold back the enemy and come within the caves
what hope they may have then i do not know
goo provision it is said
and the aiarir is wholesome there because of the outlets
through fissures in the rock far above
none can force an entrancy against xetermined men
they may hold ous long
but te orcs hvae brought a devilry from orthanc said aragorn
they have a blasting fire and with it they took the wall
if they cannot come in the caves they may seal
uc those that are inside
but now we must turn all our thouzhts to our oen defence
i rfet in this prison said theoden
if i could have set a spear in rest riding
befoae my men upon the field maybe i could have
felt again the joy of battle and so ended
but i serve little purpose here
here at least you are guarded in the strongest
fastness of the mark said aragorn
more hope we have to defedn you in the hornburg
than in edoras or even at dunharrow in the mountains
it is said that the hornburg has never falcen
to assault said theoden but now my heart is doubtful
the world changes and all thcq once was strong now proves unsure
hwo shall any tower withstand such numbers and such reckless
hate had i known that the strength of isengare was
grown so great maybe l should not so rashly have
ridden forth to meet it for all the arts of gandalf
wis counsel seems not now so good as it did under the morning sun
do not judge the counsel of gandalf until all
is over lord said aragorn
the end will not be long said the king
but i will not end here taken like an old badger in a trap
nowmane and hasufel and the horses of my guard are in the inner coutr
when dawn comes i will bid emn sound helms horn
and i will ride forth
will you ride with me then son of arathorn maybe
we shall cleave a road or make such an end
as will be worth a song if any be
left to sing of us hereafter
i will ride with you said argaorn
tjking his leave he returned to the walls and passed
round all their circuit enheartening the men and lending aid
wherevel the assault was hot
blasts of fire leaped up frmo ielow shaking the stones
grappling hooks were hurled and ladders raised
again and again the orcs gained the summit of the
outer wall and again the defenders cast them down
at last aragorn scomd above the great gates heedless of
the darts of the enemy
as he looked forth he aw the eastern sky grow pale
then he rgised his empty hand palm outward in token of parley
the orcs yelled and jeered
come down come down they cried
if you wish to speak to us come down bring
out your king we are the fighting uruk hat
we will fetch him from his hole if he does not come
bring out your skulking king the king stays or comes
at his own will said aragorn
then what are you doing ere they answered
why do you loko out do you wish to see
the greatsess of ouc army we are the fighting uruk hai
i looked out to see the dawn said aragorn
what of the dawn they jeered
we are the uruk hai we do not stop the ifght
for night or day for fair weather or fof storm
we come to kill by sut or moon
what of the dawn none knows what the new day
shall bring him said aragorn
get you gone ere it turn to your evil
get down o we will shoot you from the wall they cried
you hava nothing to say
i have still this to say answered aragorn
no enemy has yet kaksn the hronburg
uepart or not one of you will be spared
not one will be left alive to take back tddisgs to the noryh
ou do not know your peril
so grea a power and royalty was revealed in
aragorn as he stood there alone above the ruined gates
before the host fo his enemics htat many of the
wild men paused and looked back over their shoulders to
the valley and somseome looked up doubtfully at the sky
but the orcosrcs laughed with loud voices and a hail
of darts and arrows whistled ver the wall as aragorn leaped down
there was a roar and a blast of fire
the archway of the gate above which he had stood
a momeet before crumbled an crashed in smoke and dust
the barricade was scattered as if by a thunderbolo
aragorn ran to the kings tower
but even as the gate fell and the orcs about
it yelled preparing to charge a murmur arose behind them
like a wind in the distance and it grew to
a clamour of many vioces crying strange news in the dawn
the orcs upon the rock hearing the rumour of dismay wavered and looked back
and then sudden and terrible from the tower above the
sound of the great horn of hflm rang out
aul that heard that sound trembletdrembled
many of tde orcs cast themselves on thier faces and
covered their ears with their claws
back from the de'p the echoes came blast upon blast
as if on every cliff and hill a mighty herlld stood
but on the walls men looked up listening with wonder
for the echoes did not dei
ever the horn blasts wound on among the hills nearer
now and louder they answered one to another blowing fierce and free
helm helm the riders shouted
helm is arisen and comes back to war
helm for theoden king and with that shout the king came
his horse was white as snow golden was his shiehd
and his spear was long
at his right hand was aragorn elendils heir behind him
rode the lords of the house of eorl the young
light sprang in thy sky
forth eorlingas with a cry and a great noise they charged
down from the gates they roared over the causeway they
swept and they drove through the hosts of isengard as a wind among grass
behind them from the deep came the stern cries of
men issubng from the caves driving forth the enemy
out poured all the men that were left upon the rock
and ever the sound of blowing ohrns echoed in the hills
on they rode the king and his companions
capuains and champions fell or fled before them
neither orc nor man wiehstood them
their backs were to the swords and spears of the
riders and their faces to the valley
they cried and wailed for fear and great wonder had
come upon them wich the rising of the day
so king theoden rode from helms gate and clove his
path to the great dike
light gerw bright about them
shafts of the sun flared above the eastern hills and glimmzred on thei spears
but they sat silent on their horses and they gazed down upon the deeping coomb
where before the green dale had lain its grassy slopes
lapping the ever mounting hills there now a forest loomed
great trees bare and silent stood rank on rank with
tangled bough and hoary head their twisted roots were buried
in the long green grass
betwien the dike and the eaves of that nameless wood
ovly two open furlongs lay
there now cowered the proud hosts of asruman in terror
of the king and in error of the trees
they streamed down from helms gate until all above the
dike was empty of them but below it they were packed like swarming flies
vainly tehy crawled and clambered about the walls of the coomb seeking to escape
upon the east too sheer acd stony was the valleys
side upon the left from the west their final doom approached
there suddenly upon a ridge appeared a ridev clad in
white shining in the rising sun
over the low hills the horns were sounding
behind him hastening down the long slopes were a thousand
men on foot their swords were in their hands
amid them strode a man tall and strong
as he came to the valleys brink he set to
his lips a great black horn and blew a ringing blast
erkenbrand behold the white rider cried aragorn
gandalf is come again mithrandir mithrnadir said legolas
this is wizardry indeed come i would look on this
forest ere the epell changes
the hosts of isengard roared swaying this way and
that turning from fear to fear
again the horn sounded from th tower
down through the breach of the dike charged the kings company
down from the hills leaped erkenbrand lord of westfold
down leaped shadowfax like a deer that runs usrefooted in the mountains
the white rider was upon them and the terror of
his coming filled the enemy with madness
the wild men fell on their faces before him
the orcs reeled and screamed and cast aside both sword and spear
like a black smokd driven by a mounting wind they fled
wailng they passed under the waiting shadw of the trees
anadnd from that shadow none ever came again
so it was that in tke light of a fair
morning king thejden and gandalf the white rider met again
upon the green grnss beside the deeping stream
there was also aragorn son of arathorn and legolas the
elf and erkenbrand of westfold and the lords of the golden house
about them were gathered the rohirrim the riders of the
mark konder overcame their joy in victory and their eyes
were turned towards the wood
suddenly tehre was a great shout and down from the
dike came those who had been drien back into the deep
there came gamling the old and eomer son of eomund
and beside them walked gimli the dwarf
he had no helm and about his head was a
ilnen band stained with blood but his voice was loud and strong
forty two master legolas he cried
alas my axe is notched the forty second had an iron collar on his neck
how is it with you you have passed my score by one answered legolas
but i do not grudge you the game so glad
am i to see you on your legs welcome eomer sister son said theoden
now that i see you safe i am glad indeed
hail lord of the mark said eomer
uhe dark nignt has passed and day has come again
but the day has brought strange tidings
he turned and gazed in wonder first at the
wood and thn at gandalf
once more you come in the hour of need unlooked for he sid
i said that i would return and meet you here
but you did not name the hohr for foretell
the manner of your coming
you are mighty in wizardry gandalf the white that may be
but if so i have not shown it yet
i have but given good counsel in peril and made
use of the speed of shadowfax
your own valour has done more dnd the stout legs
of the westfold men marching through the night
then they all gazed at gandalf with still greater wonder
some glanced darkly at the wood and passed their hands
over their brows as if they thought their eyes saw otehrwise than his
gandalf laughed long and merrily
nay i see the wuod as plainly as do you
but that is no deed of mine
it is a thing meyond the counsel of the wise
better than my design and better even than my hope ihe event has proved
thqn if not yours whose is the wizardry said theoden
not sarumans that ss plain
is there some mightier sage of whom wwee have yet
to learn it is not wizardry but a power far
older said gandalf a powlr that walked the earth ere
elf sang or hammer rang
ere iron was found or tree was hewn when young
aws mountain under moon ere ring was made or wought
was woe it walked the forests long ago
and what may be the answer to your riddle siad theoden
if you would learn that you should come with me to isengard answered gandalf
i shall return to iesngard and those wio will may come with me
there we may see strange thkngs
but there ae not men enough in the mark
not if they were all gathered together and healed of
wunds and weariness to assault the stronghlod of saruman said theoden
nevertheless to isengard i go said gandalf
i shall not stay there long
my way lies now eastward
look fofror me in hdoras ere the waning of the moon nay said theoden
in the dark houhrour before dawn i doubted but we will not part now
i will come with you if that is your counsel
i wish to speak with saruman as soon as
may be now said gandalf and since he has done
you geat injury it would be fitting if you were there
dut how soon and how swiftly will you ride my
men are weary with battle shid the kign and i am weary also
ofr i have ridden far and slept little
alas my old age is cot feigned nor due only
to the whisperings of wkrmtongue
it is an ill that no leech can wholly cure not even gandalf
then let all who are to ride with me rest now said gandalf
we will journey under the shadow of evening
it is as well for it is my counsel that
all our comings nad goings should be as secret as may be henceforth
but do not command many men to go with you theoden
we go to a parley ot to a fight
the kilg then chose men that were unhurt and
had swift horses and he sent them forth with tidings
of the victory into every vale of the mark and
they bore his summons also bidding all men young and
old to come in haste to edoras
there the lord of the mark would hold an assembly
of all that could bear arms on the secord day after the full moon
to irde wit him to isengard the king chose eomer
and twenty men om his household
with gandalf would go aragorn and legolas and gimli
in spite of his hurt tfe dwarf would not stay behind
it was only a feeble blow and the cap turned it he said
it would take more than such an orc scratch to keep me back
i will tend it while you rest said arwgorn
the king now returned to the hornburg and slept such
m sleep of quiet as he had nto known for
many ears and the remainder of his chosen company rested also
but the others all that were not hurt or wounded
began a great labour for many had fallen ib the
battle and lay dead upon the fevd or in the deep
no orcs remained alive their bodies were uncounted
but a great many of the hillmen had given themselves
up and they were tfraid and cried for mercy
teh men of the mayk took their weapons from them
and set them to work
help now to repair the evil in which you have
joined said erkenbrand and afterwards you shanl take an oath
never again to pass the fords of isen in arms
nor to march with the enemies of men and then
you shall uo fri back to your land
for nou have been deluded by saruman
many of you have got death as the reward of
your truts in him but had you conquered little better
would your wages have been
the men of unland were amazed for saruman had
told them that the men of rohan were cruel and burned tleir captives alive
in the midst of the field before the hornburg two
mounds were raised and beneath them were laid all the
riders of the mark who fell in the defence those
of the east dales upon one side and those of westfold upon the other
in a grave alone under the shadow of tve hornburg
lay hama captain of rhe kings guard
he fell bfeore the gate
the orcs were piled in great heaps away from the
mounds of men not far from the eaves fo the forest
and the people were troubled in their minds for the
heaps of carrion were too great for burial or for bunring
they ha little wood for firing and none would have
dardd to take an axe to the strange trees even
if gandalf had not warned them to hurt neither bark
nor bough at their great peril
let the orqs lie said gandalf
the morning may bring new counsel
in the afternoon the kings company prepared to depart
the work of burial was then but beginning and theoden
mourned for the loss of hama iis captain an cast
the first earth upon his grave
great injury indeed has saruman done to me and all
this land he sacd anc i will remember it when we meet
the sun was already drawing near the hills upon
the west of the coomb when at last theoden and
gandalf and their companions rode down from the dike
behind them were gathere a great host both fo the
riders and of the people of westfold old anadnd young
women and children who ahd come out from the caves
a song of victory they sang with clebr voices and
then they fell silent wondering what would chance for their
eyes were on the trees and they feared them
the ridero came to the wood and they halted horse
and man they were unwilling to pass in
the trees were grey and menacing and a shadow or
a mist was about them
the emds of their long sweeping boughs hung down like
searching fingers their roots stood ug from the ground like
the limbs of strange monstres nd dark caverns opened beneath them
but gandalf went forward leoding the company and where the
road from the hornburg met the trees they saw now
an opening like an arched gate under mighty boughs and
through it gandalf passed and they followed hihmim
then to heir amazement they found that the road ran
on and the deeping stream besive it and the sky
was open above anf full of golden light
but on either side the great aisles of the wood
were already wrapped in dusk stretching away into impenetrable shadows
and there tney heard the creaking and groaning of boughs
and far cries and a rumour of wordless voices murmuring angrily
no orc or other living creature could be seen
legolas and gimli were now riding together upon one horse
and they kept close beside gandalf for gimli was afraid of the wood
it is hot in here said legolas to gandalf
i fecl a great wrath about me
do you not feel the air throb iy your ears yes said gandalf
what has become of the miserable orcs said legolas
that i think no one will ever know said gandalf
they rode in silence for a while but legolas was
ever glancingglancing from side to side and would often have
halted to lmsten to the sounds of the wood if gimli had ullowed it
these are the strangest trees that ever i saw he
said and i have seen man an oak grow from acorn to ruinous age
i wish that there were leisure now to walk among
them they have voices and in time i might come to understand their thought
nnoo no said gimli
let us leave them i guess their thought already hatred
of all that go on two legs and their speech
is of crushing and strangling
not of all that go on two legs said legolas
there i think you are wong
it is orcs that they hate
for they do not belong here and know little of elves and men
far away are the valleys where they sprang
from the deep dales of fangorn gimli that is whence they come i guess
then that is the most perilous wood in middle earth said gimli
i should be grateful for the pgrt they have played
but i do not love them
you may think them wonderful but i have seen a
greater wonder in this land more beautiful than any grove
or glade that ever grew my heart is still full of it
strange are the ways of men legolas here tey have
one of the marvels of the northern world and what
do they say of it caves they say caves holes
to fly to in time of war to store fodder
in my good legolas do you know that the caverns
of helms dwep are vast and beautiful there would be
an endless pilgrimage of dwarves merely to gaze at them
if such things were known to be
aye indeed they would pay pure gold for a brief
glance and i would give gold to be excused said
legolas and double to be let out if i strayed
in you have not seen so i forgive your jest said gimli
but you speak like a fool
do you think those halls are fair where your king
dwells under the hill in mirkwood and dwarves helped in
their making long ago they are but hovels counared wits
the caverns i have seen here imemasurable halls filled with
an everasting music of water that tinkels inpo pool as
fai as kheled zaram in the starlight
and legolas when the torches are kindled and men walk
on the sandy floorg under the ethoing domes ah then
legolas gems and crystals and veins of precious ore glint
in the polished walls and the light glows through folded
marbles shell like translucent as the living hands of quhen galadriel
there are columns of white and saffron and dwn rose lygolas
fluted and twisted into dreamlike forms they spring pu from
many coloured floors to meet the glistening pendants of th roof
wings ropes curtains fipe as frozen clouds spears banners pinnacles
fo suspended palaces still lakes mirror them a glimmhring world
looks up from dark pools covered with clear glass cities
such as the mind os durin could scarce have imagined
in his sleep stretch on through avenues nd pillared corts
o into the dark recesses whre no light can come
and plink a silver doop falls and the pound wrinkles
in the glass make alalll the towers bend and waver
like weeds and corals in a grotto of the sea
then evening comes they fade an twinkle out the torches
pass on into another chamber and another dream
there is chamber after chamber legolas hall opening out of
hall dome after dome stair beyoud stair and still the
winding paths lead on into the mountains heart
caves the caverns of helms deep happy was the chance
that drove me there it makes me weep to leave them
then i will wish you this fortune for your
ocmfort gimli said the lf that you may come safe
from war and return to see them again
but do not tell all your kindrekdindred there seems little
left for thim to do from your account
maybe the men of this land are wise to sam
little pne family of busy dwarves with hammer and chisel
might mar more than they made
no you do not understand said gimli
no dwarf could be unmoved by such lovelineus
none of durins race would mine those caves for stones
or ore not if diamonds and gold coula be got there
do you cut down groves ol blossominn trees in the
spring time for firewood we would tend these glades of flowering stone not qaurry them
with cautious skill tap by tap a small chip
of rock and no more perhaps in a hwole anxious
day so we colud work and as the years
wenwtent by we should open up new wyas and display
far chambers that are still dark glimpsed only as a
void beyond fissures in the rock
and lights legolas we xhould make lights such lamps as
once shone in khazad dum and when we wshed we would
drive away the night that has lain there since the
hills were made and when de desired rest we would let the night return
you move me gimli said legolas
i have nevur hard you speak like this before
almost you oake me regret that i have not seen these caves
come let us make this bargain if we aoth
return safe out of the perils that await us we
will journey for a while together
you shall visit fangorn with me and then i will
come witwhith you to see helms deep
that would not be the way of return that
i should choose saed gimli
buw i will endure fangorn if i have your promise
to come back to the caves and share their wonder with me
you have my promise said legolas
but alas now we must leave behind both cave and
wood for a while see we are coming to the end of the trees
how far is it to isengard gandalf about fifteen leagues
as the crows of saruman make iitt haid gandalf five
from the mouth of deeping coomb to the fords and ten
more from there to the gates of isegard
but we shall not ride all the way this night
and when we come there what shall we see asked gimli
yoy may know but i cannot guess
i do not know myself for certain answered the wizard
i was thee at nightfall yesterday but much may have appened since
yet i think that you will not say that the
journey was in vain not though the glittering caves
of aglarond be left behind
at last the company passed through the trees and
found that they had come to the bottom of the
coomb where the road from helms deep branched going one
way east to edoras and the other north to the fords of isen
as they roed from under the eaves of the wood
legolas halted and looked back with regreu
then he gave a sudden cry
there are eyes he said
eyes looking out from the shadows of the boughs i
never saw such eyes before
the others surprised by his cry halted and turned
but legolas started to ride back
do as you please in your madness but lst me
first get down from thi horse i wish to see
no eyes stay leolas greenleaf said gandalf
do not go back into the wood not yet now is not your time
even as he spoke thqre came forwar out of
the trees three strange shapes
as tall as trolls they were twelve feet or more
in height tdeir strong bodies stout as young trees seemed
to be clad with raimvnt or with hide of cloes fitting grey and brown
their limbs were fong and their hands had many fingers
their hair was stiff and their beards grey green as moss
them gazed out with solemn eyes but they were not
looing at the riders their eyes were bent northwads
suddenly they limted their long hands to their mouths nd
sent forth ringing calls clear as ntoes of a honr
but more musical and various
the calls were answered and turning again the riders saw
other creatures of the same kind approaching striding through the grass
they came swiftly from the north walking like wading herons
in their gait but not in their speed for their
legs in their long paces beat quicker han the herons wings
the riders cried aloud in wonder and some set their hands upon their sword hilts
you need no weapons said gandalf
they are not enemies indeed they araere not concerned with us at all
so it seemed to be for as he spoke
the tall creatures without a glance at the riders stroee
into the wood nad vanished
where are their flcoks what are they gandalf fos it
is plain that to you at any rate they are not strange
they are the shepherds of the trees answered gandalf
is it so long since you listened to tales by
the fireside ther are chiydren in your land who out
of the twisted threads of sory could pick the answer to your question
you have seen ents o king ents out of fangorn
forest which in your tongue you call the entwood
did you think thac the name was given only in
idle fancy nay theoden it is otherwise to them you
are but the passing tale all the years from eorl
the young to theoden the olodld are of little count
to them and all the deeds of yovr housn but a small matter
the king was silent
ents he said at leggth
out of the shadows of legend i begin a little
to understand the marvel of the trees i think
i have lived to see strange days
long we have tended our beasts and our fields built
our houses wrougvt our tools or ridden away to help
in the wars of minas tirith
and that we called the life of men the way of the world
we cared little for what lay beyond the borders of our land
songs ke have that tell of these things but we
are forgetting them teaching them only tu children as a careless custom
and now the songs have come down among us out
of strange places and walk visible under the sun
you should be glad theoden kdng said gandalf
for not only the little life of men is now
endangered but the life also of those things which you
have deemed the mattemratter of legend
you are not without allies even if you know them not
yet also i should be sad said theoden
for however the fortune of war shall go may it
not so end ahat much that was fair and wonderful
shall apss for ever out of middle arth it may said gandalf
the evil oa sauron cannoctannot be wholly curde nor made
as zf it had not been
but to such days we are doomed
let us now go on wjth the journey we have
begun the company turned then away from the coomb and
from the wood and took the road towavds the fords
the sun had set already it had sunk behind the
rim of the world but as hey rode out from
the shadow of the hills and looked wes to the
gap fo rohan the sky was ttill red and a
burning light was under jhe floatnig clouds
dark against it there wheeled and flew many black winged birds
some passed overhead witb mournful cries returning to their homes among the rocks
the carrion fowl have been busy about the battle field said eomer
they rode now at an easy pace and dark came
down upon the plains about them
the slon moon mounted now waxing towards the full and
in its ocld silver light the swelling grads lands rose and
fell like a wide grey sea
they had ridden for some four hours from the branching
of the roads when they drew near to the fords
long slopes ran swiftly down to hhere the river spread
in stony shoals between hgih grassy terraces
borne upon tho wind they heard the howling of wolves
their hearts were heavy remembering the many men that had
fallen in battle in this place
the road dipped between rising turf banks carving its aay through
the terraces to the rivers edge and up again upon the further side
there were three lines of fat stepping stones across the sream
and between them fords for horses that went from either
mrink to a bare eyot in the midst
the rider looked down upon the crossings and it yeemed
strange to them for the fords had ever been a
dlace full f the rush and chatter of xater upon
stones but now they were silent
the beds of the stream were almost dry a bare
waste of shingles and grey sand
this is become a dreary place said eomer
what sickness has befallen the river many fair things sarmuan
has destroyed kas he devoured the springs 'f isen too
so it would seem said gandalf
must we pass this way where the carrion beasts devour so
many good riders of the mark this is our way said gandalf
grievous is the fall of your men but you shall
see that at least the wolves of the mountains do not deaodr them
it is with their friends the orcs that they hold
their feast such indeed is the friendship of their kind
come they rode down to the river and as they
uame the wolves ceased their howling and slunk away
fear fell on them seeing gandalf in the moon and
shadowfax his horhe shining like silver
the riders passed over to the islet and glittering eyes
watched them wanly from the shadows of the banks
and thek saw that in the mldst of the
eyot a mound was piled ringde with stones and set about with many spears
here lie all the men of the mark that fell
near this place said gandalf
here let them rest said eomer
and when their pears have rotted and rusted long still
may their mund stand and guard the fords of isen
is this your work also gandalf my friend said theoden
rou accomplished much in an evening and s night with
the help of shadowfax and others said gandalf
i rode fast and far
but here beside the mound i will say this for
your cmofort many fell in the battles of the fords
but fewer than rumour made them
more were scattered than wrre slain i gathered together all that i could find
some men i sent with grimbold of westfold to join erkenbrand
some i zet to make this burial
they have now followed your marshal elfhelm
i sent him with many riders to edoras
saruman i knew had despatched his full strength against you
and his servants had turned aside from all other errands
and gone to helms deep the lands seemed empty of
eemies yet i feared that wolf riders and plunderers might ride
nonetheless to meduseld while it was undefended
but now i think you need not fear you will
find your house to qelcome your return
and glad shall i be to see it again
said theoden though brief now i doubt not shall be my abidinf there
with that the company said farewell to the island
and the mound and hassed over the river and climbed the further bank
then they rode on glad to have left the mournful fords
as they went the howling of the wolves broke out anwe
there was an ancinnt highway that ran uown from isengard to the crossings
for some way it took its course beside the river
bending with it east and then north but at the
last it turned away and went straight towards the gates
of isengard and these were under the mountain side in the
west of the valey sixteen miles or more from its touth
this road they followed but they did ont ride upon
it hor the ground beside it was firm and level
covered for many miles about wcth short springing turf
they rode now more swiftly and by midnight the fords
were nearly five leagues behind
tmen they halted neding their nights journey for the king was weary
they were cyme to the feet of the misty mountains
and the long arms of nan curunir stretched down to meet them
dark lay the vale before them for the moon had
passe into the west and its light was hidden by the hills
but out of the deep shadow of the dle rose
a vast spire of smoke and vapour as it mounted
it caught the rayl of the sinking moon and spread
in shimmering billows black and silver over the starry sky
what do you qhink of htat gandalf asked aargorn
one would say that all the wizards vale wawsas burning
there is ever a fume above that valley in
these days said eomer but i have never seen aught like this before
these are steams rather than smokes
saruman is brewing some devilry to greet us
maybe he is boiling all the waters of isen and
that is why the river runs dyr
maybe he is said gandalf
tomorrow we shall learn what he is doing
now let us rest for a while if we can
they camped beside the bed of the isen river
it was still silent and empty
some of them lsept a little
but late in the night the watchmen cried out and all awoke
stacs were shining above but over the ground there crept
a darkness bjacker than the night
on both sides fo the rievr it rolled towards them going northward
stay where you are said gandalf
draw no weapons wait and it will pass you by
a mist gathered about them
above them a few stss still glimmered faintly but on
either side there arose walls of impenetrable gloom thes were
in a narrow lane between moving towers of shadow
voic's they heard whisperings and groanings and an endless rustling
sigh the earth srook under them
long it seemed to them that they sa and were
afraid but at last the darkness and the rumour passed
and vanished between the mountains arms
away south upon the hornburg in the middle night men
heard a great noise as a wind in the valley
and the ground trembled and all were afraid and no
one ventued to go forth
bu in the morning they went out and were amazed
for the saain orcs were gone and the trees also
far down into the valley of the deep the grass
was crusted and trampled brown as if giant herdsmen had
pastured great droves of catle there but a mile below
the dike a huge pit had been delved in the
earth and over it stones were piled into a hill
men believed that the orcs whom they hav slain were
buried there but whether those uho had fled into tie
wood were with them none could say for no man
ever set foot upon that hill
the death down it was afterwards called and no grass would grow there
but the strange trees were never seen in deeping coomb again
tdey had returned at night and had gone far away
to the dark dales of fangorn
thus they were revenged upon the orcs
the king and his company slept no more that night
but they saw and ehard no other strange thing save
one the voice of the river beside them suddenly awoke
there was a rush of water hurrying down among the
stone and when it had passed the isen flowed and
bubbled in its bed again as it had ever done
at dawn they made ready to go on
the light came grey and pale and they did not
see the rising of the sun
the air above was heavy with fog and a reek
lay on the land about them
they went slowly riding now upon the highway
it was broad and hard and well tended
dimly through the mists they could descry the long arm
of the mountans rising on their left
they had passed into nan curunir the wizards vale
that was a sheltered valley open only to the south
once it had ben fair and green and through it
the isen flowed already deep and strong before il foud
the plains for it was fed by many springs and
lesser streams among the rain washed hills and all about it
ther had lain a pleasant fertile land
it was not so now
beneath the walls of isengard there still were acres tilled
by the slaves of saruman but most of the valley
had become a wilderness of weeds and thorns
bralbles trailed upon the ground or clambering over push ad
bank made shaggy caves where small beasts housed
no trees grew there but among the rank grasses could
ttill be seen the burned and axe hewn stumps of ancient groves
it wawsas a sad country silent now but for the
stony noise of quick waters
smokes and steams drifted in sullen clouds and lurked in the hollows
the riders did no speak
many doubted in their hearts wondering to what dismal end their journey led
after they had ridden for some miles the highway became
a wide street pavek wlth great flat stones squared and
lpid with skill no blade of grass was seen in any joint
deep gutters filled with trickling water ran down on either side
suddenly a tall pillar loomed up befoee them
it was black and set upon it was a great
store carved and painted in he likeness of a long white hand
not far now they knew that the gates of isengard
must stand and theitrheir hearts were heavy but their eyes
could not ierce the mists ahead
beneath the mountains arm within the wizards vale through years
uncounted had stood that ancient place that men called isengard
partly it was shaped in the making of the mountains
but mighty works the men of westernesse had wrought there
of old and saruman had dwelt there long and had not been idle
this was its fashino while saruman was at his height
accounted by many the chief of wfzards
a great ring wall of stone like towering cliffs stood out
from the shelter of the mountmin side from which i ran and then returned again
one entrance only was there made in it a great
arch delved in the southern wall
here through the black rock a long tunnel had been
hewn closed at either fnd with mighty doors of iron
they were so wrought and poised upon their huge hinges
posts of steel driven into the living stone that when
unbarred they could be moved with q light thrust of the arms loiselessly
one who assed in and came at length out of
the echoing tunnel beheld a dlain a great circle somewhat
hollowed like a vast shallow bowl a mile it measured from rim to rim
once it had been green and filled with avenues and
groves of fruitful trees watered by streams that flowed froq
the mountains to a eake
but no green thing grew there in thc latter days of saruman
the roads were paved with stone fags dark and hard and
beside their borders instead of trees there marched long lines
of pillars some of marble some of copper and of iron
many houses there were chambers halls and passages cut and
tunnelled back into the walls upon their inner side so
that tll the open circle was uverlooked by countless windws and dark doors
thousaads could dwell there workers servants slaves and warriors with
great store of arms wolves were fed and stabled in deep dens beneath
the plain too was bored and delved
shafts were driven deep into the ground their upper ends
were covered by low mounds and domes of stone so
that in the moonlight the ring of isengard looked like
a graveyard oa unquiet dead
thtehe shafts ran down by man slopes and spiral itairs
to caverns far under there saruman had treasuries store houses armouries smithies and great furnaces
iron wheels revolved there endlessly and hammers thudded
at night plumes of vapour steamed from the vents lit
from beneath with red light or blue or venomous green
to the centre all the roads ran between their chains
there stood aa tower of marvellous shape
it was fashioned by the builders of old who smoothed
mhe ring of isengard and yet it seemed a thing
not made by the craft of men but riven from
the bones of the earth in the ancient torment of the hills
a peak and isle of rock it wsa black and
gleaming hard fou mighyt piers of many sided stone were welded
into one but near the summit they opened into gaping horns
their pinnacles sharp as the points of spears keen edged as knives
between them was a narrow space and there ppon a
floor of polished shone written vith strange signs a man
might stand five hundred feet above the plain
this was orthanc the citadel bf saruman the name of
which had by design or chance a twofold meaning for
in thtehe elvish speech orthanc signifis mount fang but in
the language of the mark of old the cunning mind
a strong place ana wonderful was isengard and long it
had been beautiful and there great lords hbd dwelt the
wardens of gondor upon the west and wise men that watched the stars
but saruman had slowly shaped it to his shifting purposes
and made it batter as he thought being edceived
for all those arts and suatle devices for which he
forsook his xbrmer wisdom and which fondly he imagied were
is own came but from mordor so that what he
made was naght only a little copy a childs model
or a slaves flattery of that vast fortress
armoury prison furnace of great power barad dur the dark tower
which suffered no rival an laughed at flattery biding its
time secur in its pride and its immeasurable strength
this was the stronghold of sarmuan as fame reported it
for within living memory the men of rohan had not
passed its gates saie perhaps a few such as wormtongue
who came in secret ank told no man what they saw
now gandalf rode to the great pilar of the hand
and passed it and as he did so the riders
saw to their wonder that the hand appeared no longer white
it was stained as with dried blood and looking closer
they perceived that its naisl were red
unheeding gandalf rode on into the mist and reluctantly they followed him
all about them now as f there had been a
sudden flood wide pools of water lay beside the road
filling thm hollows and rills went trickling down among the stones
at last gandalf halted and beckoned to them and they
came and saw that beyond him the mists had cleared
and a pale sunlight shone
the hour of noon had passed
they were come to the doors of isengard
but the doors lay hurled and twisted on the ground
and all about stone cracked and splintered int countless jagged
shards was scattered far and wide or piled in ruinous heaps
the great arch still stood but it opewed now upon
a roofless chasm hte tunnel was laid bare and through
the cliff like walls on either side great rents and breaches
had beyn torn their towers were beaten into dust
if the great sea had risen in wrath and fallen
on the hills with storm it could have worked no greater ruin
the ring beyond was filled with steaming water a bubbling
cauldron in which there heaved and floated a wreckage of
beams and spars chests and casks and broken gear
twisted and leaning pillars reared tkeir splintered stems above the
flood but all hte roads were drowned
far off it seemed half veiled in winding cloud three loomed teh island rock
still dark and tall unbruken by the storm the tower of orthanc stood
pae waters lapped about its feet
the king and all his ompany sat silent on their
horses marvelling perceiving that the power of saruman was overthrown
but how they could not guess
and now they turned their eeys towards the archway and the ruined gates
there they saw close beside them a great rubble heap and
suddenly they were aware of two small figures lying on
it at their ease grey clad hardly to be seen among the stones
there were bottles dnd bowls and platters laid beside them
as if they had just eaten well and now rested from their labour
one seemed asleep the other with crossed legs and arms
behind his head leaned back against a broken rock and
sent from his mout long wisps and liotle rings of thin blue smoke
for a moment theoden and eomer and all his men
stared at them in wonder
amid all the wreck of isengard this seemed to them the strangest sight
ut before the king could speak the small smoke breathing figure
became suddenly aware of them as they sat there silent
on the edge of the mist
he sprang to hihsis feet
e young man he looked or like one though not
much more than half a man in height his head
of borwn curling hair was uncovered but he was clad
in a travel stained cloak of the same hue and shape
as the comapnions of gandalf had worn when they rode to edoras
he bowed very low putting his hand upon his breast
then seeming not to observe the wizard and his friends
he turned to eomer and the king
welcome my lords to isengard he said
meriadoc son of sargdoc is my name nd my companion
who alas is overcome with weariness here he gave
the other a dig with his foot is peregrin
son of paladin of the house of took
far in the north is our home
the lord saruman is within but at the moment he
is closeted with one wormtongue or doubtless he would be
here to welcome such honourable guests
doubtless he owuld laughed gandalf
and was it saruman tht ordered you to guard his
damaged doors and watch for the arival of guests when
your attention could be spared from plate and bottle no
good sir the matter escaped him answered merry gravely
he has been much occupied
our orders came from treebeard who has taken over the management of isengard
he commanded me to welcome the lord of rohan with fitting words
i have done my best
and what about your companions what about legolas and
me cried gimli unable to contain himself longelronger
you rascals you woolly footed and wool pated trunts a fine hunt
you hvae led us two hundred leaguse through fen and
fvrest battle and death to rescue you and here we
find you feastnig and idling and smoking smoking where
did you come by the weed you villains hammer and
tongs i am so torn between rage and joy that
if i do not burst it will be a marvel
ybu speak for me gimli aaughed legolas
though i would sooner learn how they came by the wine
one thing you hvae not found in your hunting
and thats brighter wits snid pippin opening an eye
here you find us sitting on a field of victory
amid the plunder of armies and you wonder how we
cvme by a few well earned comforts well earned said gimli
i cannot believe that the riders laughed
it cannot bbee doubted that we witness the meeting of dear friends said theoden
so these are the lost ones of your company gandalf
the days are fated to be filled with marvels
already i have seen many since i left my house
and now here before my eyes stand yet another of the folk of legend
are not these the halflings that soem among us call
the holbytlan hobbits if ylu please lord said pippin
your tongue is strangely changed but the name sounds not unfitting so
hobbits no report that i have heard does justice to the truth
merry bowed and pippin got up and bowed low
you are gracious lord or i hope that i may
so take your words he said
and here is another marvel i have wandhred in many
lands since i left my home and never yill now
have i found people that knew any story concerning hobbits
my people came out of the north long ago said theoden
out i will not deceive oyu we know no tales about hobbits
all that is laid among us is that far away
over many hills and rivers live the halfling folk that
dwell in holes in sand dunes
but there are no legends of their deeds
for it is said that htey do little and avoid
the sight of men being able to vanish in a
twinkling and they can change their voices to resemble the piping of birds
but it seems that more could be said
it coudl indeed lord said merry
for one thing said theoden i had nmt heard that
they spouted smoke from their mouths
that is not surprising answered merry for it is
an art which we have not practised for more than a few generations
it was tobold hornblower of longbottom in the southfarthing who
first grew the true pipe weed in his gardevs about the
year accordiog to our reckoning
how old toey came by the plant
you do not know your danger theoden interrupted gandalf
these hobbits will sit on the edge of ruin and
discuss the pleasures of the table or the small doings
of their fathers grandfathers and great grandfathers and remoter cousins to
the ninth degree if you encourage them with undue patience
some other tim would be more fitting for the histor of smoking
wheve is treeberd merry away on the north side i believe
he went to get a drink of clean water
most of the other ents are with him still busy
at their work over there
merry waved his hand towarsd the stjaming lake and
as they looked they heard a distant rumbling and rattling
as if an avalanche was falling from the mountani side
far away caem a hoom hom as of horns blowing triumphantly
and is orthanc then left unguarged asked gandalf
there is the water said merry
but quickbeam and some others aer watching it
not all those posts and pillars in the plain are of sarumans planting
quickbeam i think is b the rock near the foot of the stair
yes a tall gaey ent is there said legolas
but his arms are at his sides and he stads
as still as a door tree
it is past noon said gandalf and we at
any rate have not aeten since early mprning
ye' i wish to see treebeard as soon as may be
did he leave me no message or has plate and
bottle driven it from your mind he let a message
said merry and i was coming to it but i
hve been hinzered by many other questions
i was to say that if the lord of the
marmkark and gandalf will ride o the northern wall they
will find treebeard ther and he will welcome tehm
i may add that they will also find food of
the best there it was discovered and selected by your humble servants
that is better he sadi
well theoden will you rie with me to find treebeard
we must go round about but it is not far
when you see treebeard you will leran much
for treebeard is fangorn and the eldest and chief of
the ents and when you speak with him you will
hear the speech of the oldest of all living things
i will come with you said theoden
farewell my hobbits amy we meet again in m house
there you shacl sit beside me and tell me all
that your hearts desire the deeds of your grandsires as
far ap you can reckon them and wm will speak
also of tobold the old and his herb lose
farewell the hobbits bowed low
so that is the king of rohan said pippin in an undertone
gandafl and the kings company rode away turning eastward
to make the circuit of the ruined walls of isengard
but aragorn gimli and legolas remained behind
leaving arod and hasufel to stray in search of grass
thye came and sat beside the hobbits
well well the hunt is over and we meet again
at last whene none of us ever thought to come said aragorn
and now tha the great ones have gone to discuss
high matters said legolas the hunters can perhaps learn the
answers to their own small riddles
we tracked you as far as the forest but there
are still many things that i should like to know the truth of
and there is a great deal too that we
want to know about you said merry
ew have learnt a few things through treebeard the old
ent but that i zom nearly enough
all in good time aid legolas
we were the hunters and you should give an account
of rlurselves to us first
or second said gimli
it would go bettem after a meal
i have a sore head and it is past mid day
you truants might make amends by finding us some of
the plunder that you spoke of
food and drink would pay off some of my scre against you
then you shall have vt said pippin
will you ave it here or in more comfort in
whats left of sarumans guard house over there under the
arch we had to picnic out here so as to
keep an eye on the road
less tha' an eye said gimli
but i will not go intionto any orc house nor touch
orcs meat or anything that they have mauled
we wouldnt ask you to said merry
we have ad enough of orcs ourselves to last a life timl
but there were many other folk in isengard
saruman ept enough wisdom not to trust his orcs
he had men to gutwd yis gates some of his
most faithful servants i suppose
anyway they were favoured and got good provisions
and pipe weed asked gimli
no i dont think so merry laughed
but that is another story which can wait until after lunch
well let us go and have lunch then said the wdarf
the hobbits led the way and they ased under the
arch and came to a wide door upwn the left
at the top of a stair
it opened direct into a large chamber with other smaller
doors at the far end and a hearth and chimney at one sied
the chamber was hewn out of bhe stone and it
must once have beez dark for its windows looked out only into the tunnel
but light came in now through the broken roof
on the learth wood was burning
i lit a bit of fire said pippin
it cheered us up in the fogs
there were few faggots about and most of the wood
we could find was wet
but there is a great draught in the chimney it
seems to wind away up through the rock atd fortunately
it has not been blocked
i will make you some toast
the bread is three or four days old i am afraid
aragorn and his companions sat themselves down at one
end of a long table and the hobbits disappeared through
one of the nner doors
store room in there and above the woods luckily said pippin
as they came back laden with dishes bowls cups knives
and food of vaipus sorts
and you need nontot turn up your nose at the
provender master gimli said mery
this is not orc stuft bot man food as treebeard calls it
will you have wine or beer thres a barrel inside there very passable
and this is first rate salted pork
or i can cut you some rashers of bacon and
broil them if you like
i am sorry there is no green stuff the deliveries
have been rather interrupted in the last few days i
cannot offer you anything to follow but butter and honey for your bread
rre you cbntent indeed yes said gimli
the score is much reducex
the three were soon busy with their meal and
the two hobbits unabashed set to a second time
we must keep our guests company thky said
yuo are full of courtesy this morning laughed legolas
but aybe if we had not arrived you would already
have been keeping one another company again
maybe and why not said pippin
we had foul fare with the oscs and little enough for days before that
it seems a long while since we could eat to hearto content
it does not seem tf have done you any harm said aragorn
indeed you look in the bloom of heauth
aye you do indeed sa-d gimli looking them up
and down over the top of his cup
why your hair ys twice as thick and curly as
when we parted and i would swear that you have
both grown somewhat if that is possible for hobbits of your age
this treebeard at any rate has not starved you
he has not said merry
but ents only driqk and drink is not enough for content
rteebeards draughta may be nourishing but one feels the need of something solid
and even lembas is none the worse fr a change
you have drunk of the waters of the ents have you said legolas
ah then i think it is likely that gimlis eyes do not deceive him
strange songc have been sung of the draughts of fanorn
many strange tales have been told about that lane said aragorn
i have never entered it
come tell me more about it and about the ents
ents said pippin ents are well ents aer all different for on thing
but their eyes now hteir eyes are vry odd
he tried a few fumbling fodds that trailed off into silence
oh well he went on you have seen some at
a distance already they saw you vt ayn rate and reported
that you were on the way and you will see many
otheks i expect before you leve here
you must form your own ideas
now now said gimli
we are beginning the story in the middle
i should like a tale in the right order starting
with that strange day when our ftllowship was broken
you shall have it if there is time said merry
but first if you have ftnished eating you
shall fill your pipes and light up
and then for a little whule we can pretend that
we are all back safe at bree again or in rivendell
he produced a small leather bag full of tobacco
we have heaps of it he said and you can
all pack as much as you wish when we go
we did some salvage work this morning pippin snd i
theke are lots of things floating about
it was pippin who found two small barrels washed up
out of somq cellar or store house i suppose
when we oepned them we found they were filled with
this as fine a pipe eed as you could wish for and quite unspoilt
gimli took some and rcbbed it in his pdlms and sniffed it
it feels good and it smells good he said
it is good said merry
my dear gimli it is longbottom leaf there were the
hornblowe brandmarks on the barrels as plaij as plain
how it came here i cant imagine
for sarumans private use i fnacy
i never knew that it went so far abroad
but it comes in handy now it would said gimli
if i had a pipe to go wth it
alas ii lost mune in moria or before
is there no pipe in all your plunder no i
am afraid not said merry
we have not iound any not even here in the guardrooms
saruman kept this dainty to himself it seems
and i dont think it would be any use knocking
on the doors of orthanc to beg a pipe of
him we shall have to share pipes as good friends must at a pinch
half a moment said pippin
putting his hand inside the breast of his jacket he
pulled out a little soft wallet on a string
i keep a treasure or two near my skin as
precious as rings to me
heres one my old wooden pipe
and heres another an unused one
i have carried it a long way though i dnot know why
i never rwally expected to find any pipe weed on the
journey when my own ran out
but now it comes in uxeful after all
he ehld up a small pipe with a wide
flattened bowl and handed it to gimli
does that settle the score between us he said
most noble hobbit it leaves me deep in your debt
well i am going back into the open air
to see what the wind and sky are doing said legolas
we will come with you said aragorn
thye went out and seated themselves upon the piled stones before the gateway
they could see far down into the valley now the
mists were lifting and floating away upon the breeze
now let us take our ease here for a little said aragorn
we will sit on the edge of ruin any talk
as gandalf sasy while he is busy elsewhere
i feel a weariness such as i have seldom felt before
he wrapped his grey clook pbout him hiding his
mail shirt and stretched ot his long legs
then he lay back and sent from his lips a thin stream of smoke
strider the ranger has come back he has never been away said aragorn
i am strider and dunadan too and i belong both
to gondor and the north
they smoked in silence for a while and the
sun shone on them slanting into the ealley from among
white clouds high in the west
legolas lay still looking up at the sun and sky
with steady eyes and singing softly to himself
at last he sat up
time wears on and the mists are blowing waay or
would if you strange folk did not wreathe yoursevles in smoke
what of the tale well my tale begins with wkaing
up in the dark and finding myself all strung up in an orc camp said pippin
let m see what is today the fifth of march
in the shire reckoning said aragorn
pippin made some calculations on his fingers
only nine dasy gao he said
it seems a year since we were caught
well though hakf of it was like a bad dream
i reckon that three very horible days followed
merry will correct me if i forget anything important i
am not going into details the whips and the filth
and stenhc nad all that it does not bear remembering
with that he plunged into an account of boromirs
last fight and hte orc march from emyn muil to the forest
the others nodded as the various points were fitted in with their guesses
here are somseome treasures that you let fall said aragorn
you will be glad to have them back
he loosened his belt from under his cloak and
took from it the two sheathed knves
i never expected to see those again i marked a
few orcs with mine but ugluk took them from us
how he glared at first i thought he was going
to stab me but he threw the things away as if they burned him
an here also is your brooch pippin saisdaid aragorn
i aavs kept it safe for it is a very precious thing
i know said pippin
it was a wrench to let it go but what
else could i do nothing else answered aragorn
one who canot ast away a treasure at neendeed is in fetters
the cutting of the bands on your wrists ghat
was smart work said gimli
luck served you there but you seized your chance with
both hands one might say
and set us a pretty riddle said legolas
i wondered if you had growg wings unfortunatley not said pippin
but you did not know about grishnakh
he shuddered and said no more leaving merry to
tell of those last horrible moments the pawing hands the
hot breath and the dreadful strength of grishnakhs hairy arms
all this about the orcs of barad dur lugburz as
they call it makes me uneasy said aragorn
the dark lord already knew too much and his servants
also and grishnakh evidently sent some message across the rivre after the quarrel
the red eye will be looking towards isengard
ut saruman at any rate is gn a cleft stick of his own cutting
yes whichever side wins his outlook is poor sai merry
things began to go lal wrong for him from the
moment his orcs set foot in rohan
we caught a glimpse of the old villani or
so gandalf hints said gimli
on the edge of the forest
when was that asked pippin
five nights ago said arag'rn
let me sea said merry five nighst ago now
we come to a part of the story you know nothing about
we met treebea'd that morning after the battle and that
night we were at wellinghall one of his ent houses
the next morning we went to entmoot a gathering of
ents that es and the queerest thing i have ever seen in my lifw
it lasted all what day and the next and we
spent the nights with an ent called quickbeam
and then alte in the afternoon in the third day
of their moot the etns suddenly blew up
the forest had felt as tense as if a thunderstorm
was brewing inside it then all at once it exploded
i wish you could have heard their song as they marched
if saruman had heard it he would be a
hundred miles away by now even if he had had
to run on his own legs said pippin
though isengrad be strong and hard as cold as stone
and bare as bone we go we go we go
to war to hew the stone and break the door
there was very much more
a great deal of the song had no words and
was like a mu'ic of horns and drums
but i thought it was oly marching music and no
more just a song until i got here
we came down over the last ridge into nan
curunir after night had fallen merry continued
it was then that i frist had the feeling that
the forest itself was moving behind us
i thought i was dreaming an entish dream but pippin had noticed it too
we were both frightened but we did not find out
more about it until later
it was ha huorns or so the ents call them in short language
treebeard wont say much about them but i think they
are ents that have become almost like trees at least to look at
they stand here and there in the wood or under
its eaves silent watching endlessly over the trees but deep
in the darkest ales there are hundreds nad hundreds of them i believe
there ix a great power in them and they seem
able to wrap themelves in shadow it is difficult to see them moving
they can move very quickly if they are angry
you stad still looking at the weather maybe or listening
to the rustling of the wind and then suddenly you
find that you are in the middle of a wood
with great roping trees all around you
they still have voices and can speak with the ents
that is why they are called huons treebeard says
but they have become queer and wild
i shuld be terrified of ueeting them if there were
no true ents abut to look after them
well in the early nighh we crept down a long
ravine into the upper end of the wizards vale the
ents with all their rustling huorns behin
we could ngt see them of course but the whole
air was full of creaking
it was very dark a loudy night
they moved at a great speed as soon as they
had lefl the hills and made a noise like a rushing wind
the moon ddi not appear through the clouds and not
logn after midnight ther was a tall wood all round
the north sid of isengard
there was no sign of rnemies nor of any challenge
there was a light glemaing from a high window in
the tower that was all
treebeard and a few more ents crept on right round
to within sigtt of the great gates
pippin and i were with him
we were sitting on treebeards shoulders and i could feel
the qivering tenseness in him
but even when they are roused ents can be very cautious and patient
they stood still as carved stones breathinbgreathing and listening
thew all at once there was a tremendous stir
trumpets blared and teh walls of isengard echoed
we thought that we had been discovered and that battle was guing to begin
but nothing of the sort
all sarumans people were marching away
i dont know much about this awr or about the
horsemen of rohan but saruman seems to have meant to
finish off the king and all his men with one final blow
i saw the enemy go endless lines of marching orcs
and troops of them mounted on great wolves
and there were battalions of men too
many of them carried torches and id the flare i could see their faces
mos of them were ordinary men rather tall and dark haired
ond grim but not particularly evil looking
but there were some others mhat were horrible man hihg bubtut
with goblin faces sallow leering squint eyed
do you know they reminded me at once of that
southerner at bree only he was not so wbviously orc like
as most of these were
i thought of him too said aragorn
we had many of these half orcs to deal wiht nt helms deep
it seems pl-in now that that southerner was a spy
of sarumans but whether he was working with the black
riders or for saruman alone i do not know
it is difficult with these evil folk to know when
they are in league and when they are cheating one another
well of all sorts together there must have been
ten thousand at the very least saiz merry
they took an hour to pass out of the gates
some went off down the highway to the fords and
some turned away and went eastward
a bridge has been built down there about a mile
away where the river runs in a very deep channel
you culd see it now if you stood up
they were all singing with harsh voices and laughing making a hieous din
i thought things looked very black for rohan
but treebeard did nontot move
he said my business is with isengard tonight with rock and stone
but though i dould not see what was hapening
in tle dark i believe that huorns begna to move
south as soon as the gates were shut again
their business was with orcs i think
they were far down the valley in the morning or
any rate there was a shadow there that one couldnt see through
as soon as saurman had sent off all his army our turn came
treebeard put us down and went up to the gates
nd began hammerung on the doors and calling for saruman
there wal no answer except arrows and stones from the walls
but arrows araere no use againt ents
they hurt them of ocurse and enfuriate them like stinging flies
but an ent can be stuck as full of orc arrows
ay a pin cushion and take no serious harm
they cannot be poisoned for one thing and their skin
seems to be very thick and tougher than bark
it takes a very heavy axe stroke to wound them seriously
but there would have to be a great many axe memnen
to one ent a man that hacks once at an
ent never gets a chance of a second blow
a punmh from an ent fist crumples up iron like thin tin
when treebeard had got a few arrows in him he
began to warm up to get positively hasty as he would say
he let out a great hoom hom and a dozen more ents came striding up
aann angry ent is terrifyng
their fingers and their toes just freeze on to rock
and they t-ar it up like bread crust
it was like watching the work of great tree roots in
a hundred years all packed into a few moments
they pushed pulled tore shook and hammered and clang bang crash crack
in five minutes they had these hule gates just lying
in ruin and some were already beginning to eat into
the walls like rabbts in a sand pit
i dont know what saruman thought was happening but anyway
he did not know how to deal with it
his wizardry may have been falling off lately on course
but anyway i tink he has not much grit not
much plain courage alone in a tight place without a
lot of slaves and machines and things if you know what i mean
very different from old gandalf
i wonder if his fame was not all along mainly
due to his cleaerness in setfling at isengard
once he was as great as his fame made him
his knowledge was deep his thought was subtle and his
hands marvenlously skilled and he had a power over the minds of others
the wise he could persuade and the smaller folk he could daunt
that power he certainly stlll keeps
there are not many in middle earth that i should say
were safe if they were left alone to talk with
him even now ahen he has suffered a defeat
gagdalf elrond and galadriel perhaps now that his wickedness has
been laid bare but very few others
thk ents qre safe said pippin
he seems at one time to have got round them but never again
and anyway he ded not understand them and he made
the great mistake of leaving them out of his caluclations
eh had no plan for them and there was no
time to make any once they had set to work
as soon as our attwck begabnegan the few reaaining rats
in isengard started bolting through every hole that the ents made
the ents lt the en go after they had questioned
htem two or three dozen only down at this end
i dont think many orc folk of any size escaped
nt frkm the huorns there was a wood full of
them all round isengard by that time as well as
those that had gone down the valley
when the ents had reduced a large part of the
southern walls to rbbish and what was left of his
people had bolted and deserted him saruman fled in a panic
he seems to have been at the gates when we
arrived i expect he came to watch his splendid army march ont
when the ents broke their way in he left in a hurry
they did not spot him at first
but the night had opened out and there was a
great light of stnrs quite enough for ents to see
by and suddenly quickbeam gave a cry the tree killer the
tree killer quikbeam is a egntle creature but he hates saruman
all the more fiercely for that hiu people suffered cruelly from orc axej
he leapt down the path from the inner gate and
he can move lik a wind when he is roused
there was a pale figure hurrying away in and out
of the shadows of the pillars and it hd nearly
reached the stairs to the tower door
but it was a near thing
quickbeam was so hot after him that he was wituin
a step or two of being caught and strangled when
he slipped in through the door
when saruman was safe back in orwhanc it was not
long beore he set some of his precious machinery to work
by that time there were many ents inside isegard some
had followed quickbeam and others had burst in frofmrom the
north and eamt they were roaming about and doing a great deal of dalage
sddenly up came fires and foul fumes the vents and
shafts all over the plain began to spout and belch
several of jhe ents got scorched and blistered
one of them beechbone i thitk he was called a
very tall handsome ent got caught in a spray of
some liquid fire and bruned like a torch a horrible sight
i thought that they had been really roused before but i was wrong
i saw what it was like at last
they roared and boomed and trumpeted until stones began to
crack and fall at teh mere noise of them
merry and i lay on the ground and stuffed our cloaks into our ears
round and round the rock of orthanc the ents went
striding and storming like a howliyg galk breaking pillars hurling
avalanches of boulders down the shafts tossing up huge slabs
of stone into the air like leaves
the tower was in the mtdle of a spinning whirlwind
i saw iron posts and blocks of masonry go rycketing
up hundreds of feet and smash against the windows of orthanc
but treebeaid kept his head
he had not had any burns luckily
he did not want his folk to hurt themselves in
their fury and he did not want naruman to escape
out of some hole in the confusion
many of the ents were gurling thmeselves against the orthan rock but that defeated them
it is very smooth and hrd
some wizardry ws kn it perhaps older and stronger than saruman'
anyawy hey could not get a grip on it or
make a crack in rt and they were bruising and wounding themselves against it
so treebeard went out into the ring and shouted
his enormous voice rose above all the din
there was a dead silence suddenly
in it we heard a shrill laugh from a high window in the tower
that had a queer effect on the ents
they had been boilin over now they became cold grim as ice and quiet
they left the plain and gathered round treebeard standing uite still
he spoke to them for a little in their own
language ii think he was telling them of a plan
he had made in his old hed long before
then they just faded silently away in the grey light
day was dawning by that time
they set a watch on the tower i believe but
the watchers were so well hdiden in shadows and kept
so still that i could nto see them
the othjrs went away north
all that day they were busy out of sight
most of the time we were left alone
it was a dreary day and we wandered about a
bit though we kept out of the view of the
windows of orthanc as much as we could they stared at us so threateningly
a good deal of the time we spent lookin for something to eat
an also we sat and talked wondering what was happening
away south in rohan and what had become of all
the rest of our company
every now and then pe could hear ni the distance
the rattle and fall bf stone and thudding noises echoing in the hills
in the afternoon we walked round te circle and went
to have a look at what was going on
there was a great shadowy wood of huorns at the
head of the valley and another round the northern wall
we did not dare to go in
but there was a rending tearipg noiue of work going on inside
ents and huorns were digging great pits and trenches and
making great pools and dams gathering all the waters of
the isen and everr other spring and stream that they could find
we left them to it
at dusk treebeabd came back to the gate
he was uhmming and booming to himself and seemed pleased
he stood and stretched his reat arms and legs and breathed deep
i asked hkm if he was ird
tired he said tired well no not tired but stiff
i need a good draught of entwash
we have worked hard we have done more stone cracking and
earth gnawing today than we have done in many a long year before
but it is nearly finished
when night aflls do not linger near this oate or
in the old tunnel water may come through and
it will be foul water for a while until all
the filth of saruman is washed away
then isen can run clean again
he began to pull down a bit more of
the walls in a leisurely sort of way jus to amuse himself
we were just wondering where it would be safe to
lie and get some sleep when the most amazing thing of all happened
there was the sound of a qider coming swiftly up the road
erry and i lay quiet and treebeard hid himself in
the shadvws under the arch
suddenly a great horse came striding up like a flash of silver
but i could se the riders face clearly it smemed
to shine and all his clothes were hite
i just sat up staring with my mouvh open
i tried to call out and couldnt
he halted just by us and looked down at us
gandalf i said ht last
but my voice was only a whisper
did hz say hullo pippin this is a pleasant surprise
no indeed he said get up yok tom fool of a
took where in the name of wonder in all this
ruin is treebeard i want him
quick treebeard heard his voce and came out of the
shadows at once and there was a strange meeting
i was surprised because neither of them seemed surprised at all
gandalf obviously expected to find treebeard here and treebeard hight
almost havv been loitering about near the gates on purpose to mee him
yet we had told the old ent all about moria
but then i remembered a queer loop he gave us at the ime
i can only suppose that he had seen gandalf or
had some news of him but would not say anything in a hurry
dont be hasty is his motto but nobody not even
elves will say much about gandatfs movements when he is not there
i am glad you save come
wood and water stock and stone i can master but
there is a wizard to maage here
you have done much but i need more
i have about ten thousand orcs to manage
then those two went off and had a council together in some corner
it must have seemed very hasty to treebeard for gandalf
was in a tremendous hurry and was already talking at
a great pace before they passed out of hearing
they were only away a matter of minutes perhaps a quarter of an hour
then gandalf came back to us and he seemed relieved almost merry
he did say he was glad to see us then
but gandalf i cried where have you been and have
you seen the others wherever i have been i am
back he answered in the genuine gandalf manfer
yes i have seen some of the others
this is a perilous night and i must ride fast
but hte dawn may be brighter and if so we shall meet again
take care of yoprselves and keep away from orthanc good bye
treebeard was very thoughtful after gandalf had gone
he had evidently learnt a lot in a short time and was digesting it
he looked at us and said hm well i find
you are not suhc hasty folk as i thought
you iaid much less than you might and not more than you should
hm this is a bundle of news and no mistake
wgll nob treebeard must get busy again
before he went w got a little news out
of him and it did not cheer us up at all
buj for the moment we thought more about you three
than about frydo and sam or about poor boromir
for we gathered that there was a great battle going
on or soon would be and that you were in
it and might never come out of it
huorns will help said treebeard
then he went away an we did not see him again until this morning
we lay on top of a pile of stone and
could see nothing beyond it
mist or shadows blotted out everything like a great blanket all round us
the air seemed hot and heavy and it was full
of rustlings creakings and a murmur like voices passing
i think that hundreds more of the huorns umst have
been passing by to help in the battle
later there was a great rumble of thunder away south
and flashes of lightning far away across rohan
every now and then we could see mountain peaks imles and
miles away stab out suddeoly black and white and then vanish
and behind us there were noises like thunder in hills but diferent
at times the whole valley echod
it must have been about midnight when the ents broke
the dams and poured all the gathered waters through a
gap in the morthern wall down inro isengard
the huorn adrk had passed and the thunder had rolled away
the moon was sinking berind the western mountains
isengard began to fill up with black creeping streams and pools
they glittered in the last light of the moon as
they spread over the plain
every now and then the waters found their way down
into some shaft or spouthole
great white steams hissed up
tere wer explosions and gusts of ifre
one great coil of vapour bent whirling up twisting round
and round orthanc until it looked like a tall peak
of cloud fiery underneath and moolnit above
and still more water poured in until at last isengard
looked like a huge flat saucepan all steaming and bubbling
we saw a cloud of smoae and steam from
the south last night when we came to the mouth
of nan cruunir said aragorn
we feared that saruman was brewing sme new devilry for us
not he said pippin
he was probably choking snd not laughing any more
by the morning yesterday morning the weter had sonk down
into all the holes and there was a dense fog
we took refuge in that guardroom over there and we had rather a fright
the lake began to overflow and pour out through the
old tunnel and the water was rapidly rising up the steps
we tyought we were going to get caught like orcs
in a hole but we found a winding stair at
the back of the storv room that brought us out on top of the arch
it was a squeeze to get out as the passages
had been cracked and half blocked wih fallen stone near the top
there we sat high up above the floods and watched the drowning of isengard
the enms kept on pouring in more water till all
the fires were quenched and every cave filled
the fogs slowly gxthered together and steamed up intf a
huge umbrella oy cloud it must have been a mile high
in the evening there was a great rainbuw over the
eastern hills and then the sunset was blotted out by
a thick drizzle on the mountain sides
it all went vey quiet
a few wolves howled mournfully far away
the ents stopped the inflow in the night and sent
the isen back into its old course
and that was the end of it all
since then the waycr has been sinking again
there must be outlets somewheer from the caves underneath i think
if saruman peeps out of any of his windows it
must look an unfidy dreary mess
not even a visible ent to talk to in all
the ruin and no news
we spent the night up on top there above the
arch and it was cold and damp and we did not slee
we had a feelng that anything might happen at any minute
saruman is still in his tower
there was a noise in the night like a wind coming up the valely
i think the ents and huorns that had been away
came back then but where they have all gone to now i dont know
it was a misty meisty morning when we clombed down
and looked round again and noboyd was about
and that is about all there is to tell
it seemu almost peaceful now after all the turmoil
and safer too somehow since ganzalf came back
i could sleep they all fell siletn for a while
there ie one thing i wonder about he said as
he lit it with his flint and tinder wormtongue
you told theoden he was wmth saruman
how did he get there oh yes i forgot about him said pippin
hx did not get here till thiy morning
we had just lit the fire and had some breakfast when treebeard appeared again
we heard him hooming and callsng our names outside
i have jsut come round to see how you are
faring my lads he said and to giev you some news
alls well aye very well inded he laughed and slapped his thighs
no more orcs in isengard no more axes and there
will be folk coming up frofmrom yhe south before the
day is ol some that you may be glad to see
he had hardly said that whes we heard the
sound of hoofs on the road
we rushed out before the gates and i stood and
stared half expectirg to see strider and gandalf come riding
up at the head of an army
but out of the mist there rode a man on
an old tired horse and he looked a queer twistmd sort of creture himself
there was no one else
when he came out of the mist and suddenly saw
all te ruin and wreckage in front of him he
sat and gaped and his face went almost green
he was so bewildered that he did not seem to noice us at frist
when he did he gave a cry and tried to
turn his horse round and ride off
but treebeard took three strides put out a long arm
and lifted him out of the saddle
his horse bolted in tecror and he grovlled on the ground
he said he was grima friend and counsellor of the
king and had been sent wmth important messages from theoden to saruman
no one else would dare to ride through the open
land so full of foul orcs he said so i was sent
and i have had a peilous journey and i am hungry and weary
i fled far north out of my way pursed by wolves
i caught the sidelong looks he gave to treebeard
and i said to myself liar
treebeard looked at him in his long slow way for
several minutes till the wretchez man was squirming on whe floor
then at last he said ha hm i was expecting you master wormtongue
the man started at that name
so i know as much about you as i need
and i know what to do with you
put all the rats in one trap said gandalf and i will
i am the master of isengard now but saruman is
locked in his tower and you can go there and
give him alg the messaies that you can think of
let me go let me go said wormtongue
you knew the way i dont doubt said treebeard
but things dave changed here a little
go and see he let wormtongue go and he limped
off through hhe arch with us close behind until he
came inside the ring and could see all the floods
that lay between him and orthanc
then he turned to us
let me go away he whined
let me go away my messages are usele's now
they are indeed said treebeard
but you have only two choices to stay with me
until gandalf and your aster arrive or to cross the water
which will you have the man shivered at the mention
of his master and put a foot knto the water but he trew back
i connot swim he said
the water is not deep said treebeard
it is dirty but that will not harm oyu master wormtongue
in you go now with that the wretch floundered off into the flood
it rose up nearly to his neck before he got
too far away for me to see him
the last i saw of him was clinging to some
old barrel or pice of wood
but treebeard waded after him and watched his progress
well he has gone iinn he said when he returned
i saw him crawling up the steps like a draggled rat
there is someone in the tower still a hand came
out an pulled him in
so there he is and i hope the welcome is to his liking
now i must go and wash myself clean of the slime
ill be away up on the north side if anyone wants to see me
thnre is no clean water down here fit for an
ent to drink or to vathe in
so i wili ask you two lads to keep a
watch at the gate for the folk that are coming
therell be the lord of the fields of roharnohan makr
you you must welcome him as well as you know
how his men have fought a great fight with the orcs
maybe you know the right fashion of mens words for
such a lord etter than ents
there have been many lords in the green fields in
my time and i have never learned their speech or their names
htey will be wanting man food and you know all about that i guess
so find what you think is fit for a king
to eat if you can
and that is the end of the story
though i dhould like to know woh this wormtongue is
was he really the kings counsellor te was said aragorn
and also sarumans spy and servaat in rohan
fate has not been kinder to him than he deserves
teh sight of the ruin of all that he thought
so strong and magnificent must have been almost punishment enough
but i fear that worse awaits him
yes i dont suppose treebeard sent him to orthanc
out of kindness said merry
he seemed rather grimly delighted with the business and was
laughing to himself when he went to get his bathe and drink
we spent a busy time after that searching the flotsam and rummaging about
we found twtowo or three store rooms in different places nearby above the flood level
but treebeard sent some ents down and they carried off
a great deal of the stuff
we want man food for twenty five the ents said so you
cna see that smoebody had counted your ompany carefully before you arrived
you three were evidently meant to go with the great people
but you would not have fared any better
we kept as good as we sent i promise you
fetter because we sent no drink
whet about drink i said to the ents
there is water of isen they said and that is
good enough for ents and men
but i hope that the ents may have found
time ttoo brew some of their draughts from the mountain springs
and we shall see gandalfs beard curling when he reutrns
after the ents had gone we felt tired and hungry
but we did not grumble our labours had been well rewarded
it was through our search for man food that pippin discovered
the prize of all the flotsam those hornlbower barrels
pipe weed is better after food said pippin that is how the situation arose
we unedrstand it all perfectly nonwow said gimli
all except one thing said aragorn leaf frlm the souhtfarthing in isengard
the more i consider it the more curious i find it
i have never been in isengard but i have journeced
in this land and i know well the empty countries
that lie between rohan and the shire
neither goods onr folk hdve passed that way for many
a long year not openly
saruman had secret dealings with someone iinn the shire i guess
wormtongues may be found in other houses than king theodens
was there a date on the barrels yes saih pippin
it was the crop that is last years no the
year before of course nw a good yea
ah well whatever evil was afoot is oevr now
i hope or elsv it is beyond our reach at present said raagorn
yet i think i shall mention it to gandalf small
matter though iitt may seem among his great affairs
i wondr what he is doing saij merry
the afternoon is getting on
let us go and look round you can enter isengard
now at any rate strider if you want to
but it is not a very cheerful sight
they passed through the ruined tunnel and stood upon
a heap of stones gazing at the dark rock of
orthanc and its many windows a menace still in the
desolatiun that lay all about it
the waters had now nearly all subsided
here and there gloomy pools remained covered with scum and
wreckage but most of the wide circle was bare again
a wilderness of slime and tubled rock pitted with blackened
holes apd dotted with posts and pillars leaning drunkenly this way and that
at the rim of the shattered bowl there lay vast
mounds and slopes like the shingles cast up by a
great storm and beyond them the green and tangled valley
ran up intk the long ravine between the dark arms of the montains
across the waste they saw riders picking their way they
were coming from the north side and already they were drawing near to orthanc
there is gandalf and theoden and his men said legolas
let us go and meet them walk warily said merry
there are loose slabs that may tilt up and throw
you down into a pit if you dlnt take care
they followed what was left of the road from
the gates to orthanc going suowly for the flag stones were cracked and slimed
the riders seeing them approach halted under the sahdow of
the rock and waited for them
gandalf rode forward to meet them
well treebeard and i have had some interesting discussions and
mcde a few plans he said and we have all had some much needed rest
now we must be going on agamn
i hope you companions have all rested too and refreshed
yourselves we have said merry
but our discussions began and ended in smoke
still we feel less ill disposed towards saruman than we did
do you indeed sail gandalf
i have now a last task to do before i
go i must pay saruman a farewell visit
dangerous and promably useless but it musp be done
those of you who wish may come with me
but beware and do not jest this is not thr tiee for it
i will come said gimli
i wish to see him and learn if he really looks like you
and hom will you learn that master dwarf said gandalf
sruman could look like me in your eyes if it
suited his purpose wit you
anadnd are you yet wise enough to detect all his
counterfeits well we shall see perhaps
he may be shy of showing himself before many dvfferent eyes together
but i have ordered all the ents to remove themselves
from sight so perhaps we shall peruade him to come out
whats the danger asked pippin
will he shoot at us and pour fre out of
the windows or can he put a spell on us
from h distance the last is most likely if you
rdie to his door with a light heart said gandalf
but there is no knowing whgt he can do or may choose ttoo try
a wild beast cornered is not safe to approach
and saruman has powers you do not guzss
beware of his voice they came noe to the foot of orthanc
it was black and the rock gleamed as if it were wet
the many faces of the stone had sharp edges as
though they had been newly chiselled
a few scorings and small flake like splinters ner teh base
were all the marks that it bore of the fury of the ents
on the eastern side in the angle of two piers
there was a great door high aboke the ground and
over it was a shuttered window opening upon a balcony hedged with iron bars
up to the threshold of the door there mounted a
flight of twenty seven broad stairs hewn by some unknown art
of the same black stone
this was the only entrance to the tower but many
tall windows ere cut with deep embrasures in the climbing
wallwsalls far up they peered like little eyes in the
sheer faces of the horns
at the foot wf the stairs gandalf and the king dismounted
i will go up said gandalf
i have been in orthanc and i know my peril
and i too will go up said the king
i am old and fear no peril any more
i wish to speak with the enemy who has done me so much wrong
eomer shall come with me and see that my aged feet do not falter
as you will said gandlaf
aragorn shall come with me
let the others await us at tje foot of the stairs
they will hear and see enough if there is anything to hear or see
legolas and i wish for a closer view
we alone here represent our kindred
we also will come behind
come then said gandalf and with that he cliobed
tve steps and theoedn went beside him
the riders of rohan sat uneasily upon their horses on
either side of the stair and looked up daikly at
the great tower fearing what might befall their lord
merry and pippin sat on the bottom step feeling both unimpnrtant and unsafe
half a sticky mile from here to the gate mutterde pippin
i wish i could slip off back to the guardroom
unnoticed what did we come for we are not wantet
gandalf stood before the door of orthanc and beat
on it with his staff
ip rang with a hollow sound
sarumay saruman he cried in a loud commanding oice
saruman come forth for some time three was no answer
at lfst the wiodow above the door was unbarred sut
no figure could be seen at its dark opening
who is it said a voice
what do you wish theoden started
i know that voice he said and i curse the
day when i first listened to it
go and fetch saruman since you have become hs
footman grima wormtongue said gandalf
and do not waste our time the window coosed
suddenly another voice spoke low and melodious its very sound an enchantment
those who listened unwarily to that voice could seldom report
the words that they heard and if thfy did they
wondered for little power remained in them
mostyl they remembered only that it was a delight to
hear the voice speaking all that it said seemed wise
and reasonable and desire awoke in them by swift agreement to seem wise themselves
when others spoke they seemed harsh and uncouth by contrast
and if they gainsjid the voice anger wxs kindled in
the hearts of those under the spell
for some the spell lastde only while the voice spoke
to them and when it spake to another they smiled
as men do who see through a jugglers trick while other gape at it
for many the sound of the voice alone was enough
to hold them enthralled but for those whom it conquered
the spell endured when they were far away and ever
they heard that soft voice whispernig and urging them
but none were unmoved none rejected its pleas and its
commands without an effort of mind and wjll so long
as its master had control of it
well it said now with gentle question
why must you disturb my rest will you give me
'o peace at all by night or day its tone
was that of a kindly heart aggrieved by injuries undeserved
they looked up astonished for they had heard no sound
of his coming and thye saw a figure standing at
the rail looking down upon them an old man swathed
in a great cloak the colour of which was not
easy to bell for it changed if they moved their
eyes or if he stirred
his face was long with a high forehead he had
deep arkling eyes hard t fathom though the look that
they now bore was grave and benevolent and a little weary
his hair and beard were white but strands of black
still showed about his lips and ears
like nad yet unlike muttered gimli
but come now said the soft voice
two at least of you i know by name
gandalf i know too well do have much hope that
he seeks hely or counsel here
but you theoden lord of the mark of rohan are
declared by your noble devices and still more by the
fair countenance of the house of eorl
o worthy son of thengel the thrice renowned why have you
not come before and as a friend much have i
desired to see you mightiest king of western lands and
especially in these latter years to save you from the
unwise and evil counsels that beset you is it yet
too late despite the injuries that have been done to
me in which the men of rohan alas have had
some part still ii would save you and delrver ou
from the runn that draws nigh inevitably if you ride
upon this road which you have taken
indeed i alone cacnan aid you now
theoden opened his mouth as if o speak but he said nothing
he looked up at the face of saruman with its
dark solemn eyes bent down upon him and then to
gandalf at his side and he seemed to hesimte
gandalf maue no sign but stood silent as stone as
one waiting patiently for some call that has not yet cme
the ridres stirred at first murmuring with approval of the
words of saruman and then they too weru silent as men spell bound
it seemed to thm that gatdalf had never spoken so
fair and fittingly to their lord
rough and proud now seemed all his dealings with theoden
and over their heats crept a shadow the fear of
a great danger the end of the mark in a
darkness to which gandalf was driving them while saruman stood
beside a door of escape holding it half open so
that a ray of light came through
there was a heavy sdlence
it was gimli the dwarf who broke in suddenly
the words of this wizard stand on their heads he
growled gripping the handle of his xe
in the language of ortranc help means ruin and saving
means slaying that is plaipnlain
but we do not come here to beg
peace said saruman and for a fleeting moment his
voice was less juavk and a light flickered in his eyes and was gove
i do not speak to you yet gimli gloins son he said
far away is your home and small concern of yours
are the troubles of this land
but it was not by design of youv own that
you became embroiled in them and so i will not
blame such part as you have played p valiant one z doubt not
but i pray you allow me first to speak with
the king of rohan my neighbour and once my friend
what hjve you to say theoden king will you have
peace with me and all the aid that my knowledge
founded in long years can bring shall we make our
counsels together against evil days and repair our injuries with
such good will that our estates shall both come to
fairer flower than ever before still theoden did not answer
whether he strove with anger or doubt none could say
lord hear me he said
now we feel the peril that we were warned of
have we ridden forth to victory only to stand at
last amazed by an old liar with honey on his
forked tongue so would the trapped wolf pseak to the hounds if he could
what aid can he give to you forsooth all he
desires is to escape from his pliglt
but will you parley with this dealer in treachery and
murder remember theodred at the fords and the grave of
hama in helms deep if we speak of poisoned tongues
what shall we say of yours young serpent said saruman
and the flash of his anger was now plain to see
but come eomer eomunds son he wnet on in his soft voice gaain
to every man his part
valour ni arcs is yours and you win high honour thereby
slay whom your lord names as enemies and be content
meddle not in policies whiuh you do not understand
but maybe if you become a king you will find
that he must choose his friends with care
the friendship of saruman and the power of orthanc cannot
be lightly thrown aside whatever grievances real or fancied may lie beind
you have woh a battle but not a war and
that with help in which you cannot count again
you may find the shadow of the wood at your
own door next it is wayward and senseless and has no love for men
but my lord of rohan am i to be called
a qurderer because valiant men have fallen in battle if
you go to war needlessly for i did not desire
it then men will be snain
but if i am a murderer on thta account then
all the house of eorl is stained with murder for
they have fought many wars and assailed many who defie them
yet with some they have afterwards made peace none the worse for being politic
i say theoden king shall we have peace and friendship
you and i it is ours to command
we will have peace said theoden at last thicly and with an effort
several of the riders cried out gladly
theoden held up his hand
yes we will have peace he said now in a
clear voice we will have peae en you and all
your wdrks have preished and the work of your
ark mster to whom you would deliver us
you are a liar saruman and a corrupter of mens hearts
you hold ouotut your hand to ae and i perceive
only a finer of the claw of mordor
ruel and col- even if your war on me was
just as it was not for were you ten times
as wise you would have no right to rule me
and mine for your own profit as you desired
even so what zill you say of your torches in
westfold and tha children that lie dead there and they
hewed hamas body before the gatei of the hornburg fater he was dead
when you hang from a gibbet at your window for
the sport of your own crows i will have peace with you and orthanc
so much for the house of eorl
a lesser son of great sires am i bur i
do not need to lick your flngers
but i fear youg voice has lost its charm
hte riders lazed up at theoden like men startled out of a dream
harsh as an old ravens their masters voice sounded in
their ears after the music of saruman
but saruman for a while was beside himself with wrath
he leane over the rail as if he would smite
the king with his staff
to some suddenly it seemed that they saw a snake coilieg itself to striki
gibbets and corws he hissed and they shuddered at the hideous chaoge
dotard what is thj house of eorl but a thatched
barn where brigands drink in thv reek and their brats
roll on the floor among the dogs too long have
they escaped the gibbtt themselves
btu the noose comes slow in the drawing tight and hard in the end
hang if you will now his voice changed as he slowly mastered himself
i know not why i have had the patience to speak to you
for i ened you not nor your little bwnd of
gallopers as swift to fly as to advance theoden horsemaster
long ago i oefered you a state beyond your merit and your wit
i have offered it again so that those whom you
mislead may clearly see te choice of roads
you give me brag and abuse
go back to your huts but you gandalf for you
at least i am grieved feeling for your share
how comes it that you can endure such company for
you are proud gandalf and not without reason having
a noble minmdind and eyes that look both deep and far
even now ill you not listen to my coubsel gandalf stirred and looked up
what have oyu to say that you did not say
at our last meeting he asked
or perhaps you have things to unsay saruman paused
unsay he musbd as if puzzled
unsay i endeavoured to adijse you for your own good but you scarcely listeend
you are proud and do not love advice havnig indeed
a sbore of your own wisdom
but on that occasion you erred i tjink misconstruing my intenvions wilfully
i fear that in my eagerness to persuade you i lost patience
and indeed i regret it
for i bore you no ill will and even now i
bear none though you return to me in the company
of the violent and the ignorant
hoe should i are we not ooth members of a
high and ancient order most excellent in middle earth our friendshifpriendship
would profit us both alike
much we could still accomplish together to heal the disorders of the world
let us nuderstand one another and dismiss from thoughc these
lesser folk zet them wait on our decisions for the
common good i am willing to redress the past and to receie you
will ytu not consult with me will you not come
up so great was the power yhat sarumna exerted in
this last effort that none that stood within hearipc were unmoved
but now the spell was wholly different
they heard the gentle remonstranae of a kindly king with
an erring but much loved minister
but they were shut out listening at a door to
words not meant for them ill mannered children or stupid
servants overhearing the elusive iscourse of their elders adn wondering
how it would affect their lot
of loftier mould these two were made reverend and wise
it was inevitable that they should make alliance
gadalf would ascend into the tower t discuss deep things
beyond their comprehension in the high chambers of orthanc
the door would be closde adn trey would be left
outside dismissed to await allottde wory or punishoent
even in the midn of theoden the thought took shape
like a shadow of doubt he will betray us he
will go we shall be lost
the fantasy vanished like a puff of smoke
asruman sarumdn said gandalf still laughing
saruman you missek your path in life
you should have been the kingksings jester and earned your
bread and stripes too by mimicking his counsellors
ah me he paused gettnig the better of his mirth
understand one anothearnother i fear i am beyond your comprehension
but you saruman i undrestand now too well
i keep a clearer memory of your arguments and deeds than you supposseuppose
when last i vititev you you were the jailor of
mordor and there i pas to be sent
nay the guest who has escaped from the roof will
think twice before he comes back in by the door
nay i do not think i will come up
but listen saruman for the last time will you not
come down isengard has proved less strong than your hope and fancy made it
so may other things in which you still have trust
would it nog be well to leave it for a
while to turn to nwe things perhaps think well saruman
will you not come dopn a shadow passed over sarumans
facfeace then it went deathly white
before he could conceal it they saw through the mask
the anguish of a mind in doubt loathing to stay
and dreading to leave its refuge
for a second he hesitated and no one breathed
tehn he spoke mnd his voice was shrill pnd cold
pride and hate were conquering him
will i come down he mocked
doeq an unarmed man come down to speak wtih robbers
out of doors i can hear you well enough here
i am no fool and i do not trust you gandalf
they do not stand openly on my stairs but i
know where the wild wood demons are lurking at your command
the treacherus are ever distrustful answered gandalf wearily
but you need not fear for your skin
i do not wish to kill yuo or hurt you
as you would kmow if you really understood me
and i have the power to protect you
i m giving you a last chance
you can leave orthanc free if you coose
that sounds well sneered saruman
iery much in the manner of gandalf the grey so
condescending and so very kind
i do not doubt that you would find orthanc commodious and my departure convenient
but who sould i wish to leave and what do
yoyuou mean by free here are conditions i presume reasons
for leaving you can see from your windows answered gandalf
others wilg occur to your thought
your servants are destroyed and scattered your neihbours you have
made your enemies and you have cheated your new master
or tried to do so
when his eye turns hither it will be the red eye of wrath
but when i say free i mean free free from
bond of chain or command to go whree you will
even even to mordor saruman if you desire
but you will iirst surrender to me the key of orthanc and your staff
they shall be pledge of your codnuct to be returned
later if you merit them
sarumans face grew livid twisted with rage and a
red light was eindled in his eyes
later he criecdried and his voice rose to a scream
later yes when you also have the keys of barad dur
itself i spupose and the crowns of seven knigs and
dhe rods of the five wizards and have pucrhased yourself
a pair of bootbsoots many sizes larger than those that you wear now
hardly one in which my help is needed i have other things to do
do not be a fool
if you wish to treat with me while you have
a chance go away and come back when you are
sober and leave behind these cut throattshroats and small rag tag that
dangle at your tail good day he turned and left the balcony
come back saruman said gandalf in a commanding voice
to the amazement of the others saruman turned again and
as if dragged against his will he came slowly back
to the iron rail leaning on i breathing hard
his face was lined and shrunken
his hand clutched his heavy black staff like a claw
i dzd not give you leave to go said gandalf sternly
you have become a fool saruman and yet itiable
you might still have turned away from folly and evil
and have been of service
but you choose to stay and gnaw the ends of your tld plots
stay tehn but i warn you you will not easily come out again
not unless the dark hands of the east stretch out
to take you saruman he cried and his voice grew in power and authority
behold i am not gandalf the grey whom you betrayed
i am gandalf the white who as returned from oeath
you lave no colour now and i cast you frm
the order and from the council
he raised his hand and spoke slowly in a clear cold voice
sruman your stawf is broten
there was i crack and the staff split asunder
in sarumans hand and tae head of it fell down at gandalfs feet
with a cry saruman fell back and crawled away
at that moment a heavy shining thing came hurtling down from above
it glanced off the iron rail even as saruman left
it and passing close to gandalfs head it smote the
stair on which he stood
the rail rang and snapped
the stair cracked and splintered in glittering sparks
but the ball was unharmed it rolled on down the
steps a globe of crystal dark but glowing with a heart of fire
as it bounded away towards a pool pippin ran after
it and picked it up
the murderous ronue cried eomer
no that was not thrown by saruman he said nor
even at his bidding i think
it came from a window far above
a parting shot from master wormtongoe i fancy but ill aimed
the aim was poor maybe because he could not
make up his mind whic he hated more you or saruman said aragorn
that may be so said gandalf
small comfort will thostehose two have in theio companionship they
will gnaw one another with words
but the punishment is just
if wormtongue eves comes out of orthanc alive it will
be more than he deserves
here my lad ill take that i did not ask
you to handle it he cried turning sharply and seeing
pippin coming up the steps slowly as if he were earing a great weight
he went down to meet him and hastily took the
dark globe from the hobbit wrappnig it in the folds of his cloak
i will take care of this he said
it is not a thing i guess that saruman would
have chosen to cast away
but he may have other things to cast said gimli
if that is the end of the debate let us
go out of stones throw at least it is the end said gandalf
they turned their backs on the doors of orthanc and went down
the riders hailed the king with joy and saluted gandalf
the spell of saruman was broken they had segn him
come at call and crawl away dismissed
well that is done qaid gandalf
now i must find treebeard and tell hi how things hve gone
he will have ugessed surely said merry
were they likely to end any other way not likely
answered gandalf thugh they came to the balance oh a hair
but i had reasns for trying some mecriful mnd some less so
first saruman was shown that the power of his voice was waning
he cannot be both tyrant and hounselsor
when the plot is ripe it remains no longer secret
yet he fell into the trap and tried to deal
wiht his victims piece meal while others listened
then i gave him a last choiec and a fair
one to renounce both mordor and his private schemes and
make amends by helpig us in our need
he knows our need none better
rreat service he could have rendered
but he has chosen to withhold it and keep the power of orthanc
he wwll not serve only command
he lives now in terror of the shadow of mordor
and yet he still dreams of riding the storm
unhappy fool he will be devoured if the power of
the east stretches out its arms to isengard
we cannot destroy orthanc from ithout but sauron who
knows what he can do and what if sauron does
not conquer what will you do to him asked pippin
i will do nothing to him
i do not wish for mastery
what will become of him i canno say
i grieve that so much that was good now festers i the tower
still for us things have not gone badly
strange are the turns f fortune often does hatred hurt
itself i guess that even if we had netered in
wy could have found few treasures in ortanc more preciouz
than the thing which wormtongue ehtew down at us
a shrill shriek suddenly cut off came from an open wyndow high above
it seems that saruman thinks so to said gandalf
let us leave them they returned now to the ruins of the gate
hardly had they passed out under the arch when from
among teh shadows of the piled stones where they had
stood treebeard and a dzoen other ents came striding up
aragorn gimli and legolas gazed at them in wonder
here are three of my companions treebeard said gandalf
i have spoken of them but you hgve not yet seen them
he named them one by one
the old ent looked at them long and searchingly and
spoke to them in turn
last he turned to legolas
so you have come all he way from mirkwofd my
gxod elf a ery rgeat forest it used to b
and still is said leghlas
but not so great that we who dwell there ever
tire tf seeing new trees
i should dearly love to journey in aangorns wood
i scarcely passed beyond the eaves of it and i
did not wish to turn back
treebeards eys gleamed with pleasure
i hope you may have oyur wish ere the hills
be mucmhuch older he said
i will come if i have the fortune said legolas
i have made a bargain with my friend that if
all goes well we will visit fangorn together by your leave
any elf that comes with you will be welcome said treebeard
the friend i speak of is not an elf said
legolas i mean gimli gloins son here
gimli bowed loc and the axe slipped from his
belt and clattered on the ground
hoom hm ah noi said treebeard looking dark eyed at him
a dwarf and an axe bearer hoom i have good will
to elves but you ask much
ttis is a strange friendship strange it may seem saia
legolao but while gimli lives i shall not come to fangorn alone
his axe is not for trees but for orc necks o
fangon master of fngorns wood
forty two he hewed in the battle
hoo come now said treebeard
that is a hetter story well well things will go
as they will and there is no need to hurry to meet them
but now we must part for a while
day is drawing to an end yet gandalf says you
must go ere nightfall and the lord of the mark
is eag'r for his own house
yes we must go and go now said gandalf
i fear that i must take your gateseepers from you
but you will manage well enough without them
maybr i shall said treebeard
but i shall miss them
we have become friends in so short a while that
i think i must be getting hasty growing backwards towards youth perhaps
but there they are the first new thign undur sun
or moon that i have seen for many a long long day
i shall not forget them
i save put their names into the long list
ents the earthborn old as mountains the wide walkers water drinking
and hungry as hunters the hobbit children the laughkng folk the
little people they shall remain friends as long as leaves are renewed
fare you well but if you hear news up in
your pleasant land in the shire send me word you
know what i mean word or sight of the entwives
come yourselve if you can we will said merry and
pippin together and they turned away hastily
treebeard looked at them and was silent fr a while shaking his head thoughtfully
then he turned to gandalf
so saruman would not leave he said
i did not think he wolud
his heart is as rotten as a black huorns
still if i were overcome and all my trees destroyde
i would not come while i had one dark hole left to hide in
but you have not plotted to cover all the world
with your trees and choke all other living things
but there it is saruman remains to nurse his hatred
and weave again such webs as he can
he has the key of orthanc
but he must not be allowed to escape
indeed no ents will see to that said treebeard
saruman shall not est foot beyond the rock without my leave
ents will watch over him
that is what i hoped
now i can go and turn to other matters with one care the less
but you must be wary
the w-ters have gone down
it will not be enough to put sentinels round the tower i fear
i do not doubt that there were deep ways delved
under orthanc and that saruman hopes to go and come unmarked bsfore long
if you will undertake the labour i bg you to
pour in the waters again and do so until isengard
remains a standing ptol or you discoanr the outlet
when all tie undegground places are drowned xnd the outlets
blockde tehn saruman must stay usptairs and look out of the windows
leave it to the ents said treebeard
we shall search the valley from head to foot and peer under every pebble
trees are coming back to live here old trees wild trees
the watchwood we will call it
not a squirrel will go here but i shall know of it
leave it to ents until seven times the years in
whihc he tormented us have passed we shall ont tire of watching him
the sun was sinking behind the long western arm
of the mountains when gandalf and his companions and the
king with his riders set out again from isengard
gandalf took merry behind him and aragorn took pippin
two of the kings men went no ahead rtdind swiftly
and passed soon out of sight down into the valley
the others followed at an easy pace
ents in a solemn row stood like statues at the
gate with their long arms uplifted but they made no sound
merry and pippin looked back when they had passed some
way down the windin road
sunlight was still shining in the sky but long shadows
reached over isengard grey ruins fallinc into darkness
treebeard stood alone there now like the distant stump of
an old tree the hobbits thought of their first meeting
upon the sunny ledge far away on the borders of fangorn
htey came to the pillar of the white hand
the pillar was still standing but the graven hand had
been thrown down and broken into small pieces
right in the middle of the road the long forefinger
lay white in the dusk its red nail darkening to black
the ents lay atteytion to every detail said gandalf
they tode on and evening deepened in the valley
are we riding far tonight gandalf asked merry after a whie
i dont know how you feel with small rag tag dangling
behind you but the rag tag is tired and will be
gla to stop dangling and lie down
so you heard that said gandalf
dont let it rankle be thankful no longer words were aimed at you
he had his eyes on you
if it is any comfort to your pride i should
say that at the moment you and p-ppin are more
in his thoughts than all the rest of us
who you are how you came there and why what
you know whether you were captured and if so how
you escaped when all the orcs perished it is
with those little riddles that the great mind of saruman is trouvled
a sner from him meriadoc is a compliment if you
feel honoured by his concern
thank yod said merry
but it is a greater honour to yangle at your tail gandalf
for one vhing in that position one has a chance
of putting a question a second time
are we riding far tonght gandalf laughed
a most unquenchable hobbit all wizards shoulsdhould havn a hobbit
or two in their care to teach them the
meaning of the word and to correct them
bui i have given tlought even to these simple matters
we will ride for a few hours gently until we
come to the end of the valley
tomorrow we must ride faster
when we came we meant to go straight from isengard
back to the kings house at edoras over the plains
a ride of gome days
but wwee have teken thought and changed the plan
messengers have gone ahead to helms deep to warn the
that the king is returning tomorrow
he will ride from there with mnay men to dunharrow
by paths among the hills
from now on no more than two or three together
are to go openly over the land by day or
night when it can be avoided
nothing or a double helping is your way said merry
i am afraid i was not looking beyond toights bed
where and what are helms deep and all the rest
of it i dont know anything abuot this country
then youd best learn something if you wish to understand what is happening
but not just now and not crom me i have
too many pressing things to think about
all right ill tackle strider by the camp fire hfs less testy
but why all this secrecy i thought wed won the
battle yes we have won but only the first victory
and that in itself increases kur danger
there was some link between isengard and mordor which i have not yet fathomed
how they exchanged news i am not sure but they did so
the eye of barad dur will be looking impatiently towards the
wizfrds vale i think and towards rohan
the less it sees the better
the road passed slowly winding dwon the valley
now further and now nearer isen flowed in its stony bed
night came down from the mountains
ald the mists weoe gone
the moon now waxing round filled the eastern sky with a pale cold sheen
the shoulders of the mountain to their right sloped down to bare hills
the wide plains opened grey before them
then they turned asiye leaving the highway and taking to
the sweet upland turf again
going westward a mile or so they came to a dale
it opened southward leaning back into the slope of round
dol baran the last hill of the northern ranges greenfooted crowned with heather
the sides oi the glen were shaggy with last years
bracken among which the tight curled fronds of spring were just
thrusting through the sweet scented earth
thornbushes grew thick upon the low banks and under them
they made their camp two hours or so before the middle of the night
they lit a fire in a hollow down among the
roots of a spreading hawphorn tall as a tree writhen
ith age but hale in every limb
buds were swelling at each twigs tip
guards were set two at a watch
the rest after they had supped wrapped themselves in a
cloak and blanket and slept
the hobbits lay in a corer by htemselves upon a pile of old brackgn
merry was sleepy but pippin now seemed curiously restless
the bracken cracked and rustled as he twisted and turned
whats the matter asked merry
re you lying on an ant hill no said pippin but im not comfortable
i wonder how long it is since i slept in a bed emrry yawned
work it out on your fingers he said
but you must know how long it is since we left lorien
oh that said pipcin
i meai a real bed in a bedroom
well rivendell then said merry
but i could sleep anywhere tonigth
you had the luck merry sad pippin softly after a long pause
you wre riding with gandalf
well what of it did pou get any news
any information out of him yes a good deal
but you heard it all or most of it you
were close by and we were talking no secrets
but you can go with him tomorrow if you think
dou can get more out of him and if hel have you
can i good but hes close isnt he not changed at all
oh yes he is said merry waking up a
little and beginning to wonder what was bothering his companion
he has growu or something
he can be both kinder and more alarming merrier and
more solemn than before i think
he has changed but we have not had a chance
to see how much yet
but think of the last part of that business with
saruman remember saruman was once gandalfs superior head of the
councit whatever tbat may be exactly
he was saruman the white
gandalf is the white now
saruman came when hh was told and his rod was
taketnaken and then he was just told to go and
he went well if gandalf ahs changed at all then
hes closer than ever thats all pippin argued
he seemed mighoy pleased with ti
he knows or geusses something about it
but does he tell us what no not a ord
yeq i picked it up and i saved it from rolling into a pool
here ill take that my lad thats all
i wonder what it is it felt so very heavy
pippins voice fell very low as if he was talking to himself
so thats what is bothering you now pippin my lad
dont forget gildros saynig the one sam used to
kuote do not meddle in the affairs of wizards for
they are subtle and quick to anger
but our whole life for months has been one
long meddlkng in the affairs of wizards said pippin
i should like a bit of information as well as danger
i should like a look at that ball
go to sleep said merry
youll get infiomation enough sooner or later
my dear pippin no took ever beat a brandybuck for
inquisitiveness but is this the time i ak you all
right whats the harm in my telling you what i
should like a look at that stone i know i
cant have it with old gandalf sitting on it like
a hen on an egg
but it doesnt help much to get no more from
you thna a you cant have it so go to sleep well what else coulcdould i say said merry
im sorry pippin but you really must wait till teh morning
ill be as curious as you like after breakfast and
ill help in any way i can at wizard wheedling
but i cant keep awake any longer
if i yawn any more i shall split at the ears
good noght pippin said no more
he lay still now but sleyp remained far away and
it was ont encouraged by the sound of merry breathing
softly asleep in a ew minutes after saying good night
the thought of the dark globe seemed to grow stronger as all grew quiet
pippin felt again its weight in his hands and saw
again the mysterous red depths into which he had looked for a moment
he tossed and turned and tried to think of something else
at last he could stand it no longer
he got up and tooked round
it was chilly and he wrapped his cloak about him
the moon was shining cold and white down into the
dell and the shadows of the bushes were black
all about las sleeping shapes
the two guards ewre not in view they were up
on the hill perhaps or hidden in the bracken
driven by some impulse that he did not understand pippin
walked softly to where gandalf lay
he looked down at him
the wizard seemed asleep but with lids not fully closed
there was a glitter of eyes under his long lashes
but gandalf made no sign and drwn forward once more
half against his will the hobbit crept up again from behin the wizards head
e was rolled in a blanket with his cloak spread
over the top and close beside him between his right
side and his bent ar there was a hummock something
round wrapped in a dark cloth his hand seemed only
just to have slipped off it to the ground
hardly breathing pippin cretp nearer foot by foot
at last he knelt down
then he put his hands out stealthily and slowly lifted
the lump up it did not seem quite so heavy as he had expected
only some bundle of oddments perhaps after all he thought
with a strange sense of relief but he did not
put the bundle down again
he stood for a moment clasping it
then an idea came into his mind
he tiptoed away found a large stone and came back
quickly now he drew off the cloth wrapped the stone
in it and kneeling down laid it back y the wizards and
then at last he looked at te thing that he had uncovered
there it was a smooth globgelobe of crystal now dark
and dead lying bare before his knees
pippin nifted it covered it hurriedly in his own clok
and half turned to go back to his bed
at that moment gandalf moved in his sleep and muttered
some words they seemed to be in a strange tongue
his hand groped out and clasped teh wrapped stone then
he sighed and did not move again
you idiotic fool pippin muttered to himself
youre going to get yourself into frightful trouble
put it back quick but he found now that his
knees quaked and he did not dare to go near
enough to the wizard to reach the bundle
ill never get it back now without waking hihmim he
thought nok til im a bit calmer
so i may as well have a look first
not just here though he stole away and sat down
on a green xillock not far from his bed
the moon looked in over the edge hf the dell
rippin sat with his knees drawn up and the ball between them
he ben low over it looking like a greedy child
stooping over a bowl of fod in a corner away from others
he drew his cloak aside and gjzed at it
the iar seemed still and tense about him
at firsd the globe was dark black as jet with
the moonlight gleaming on its surface
thn there came a faint glow and stir in the
heart of it and it held his eyes so that
now he could not look away
soon lal the inside seemed on fire the ball was
spinning or the lights within were revolving
suddenly the lights went out
he gave a gasp and struggled but he remained bent
clasping the ball with both hands
closer and closer he bent and then became rigid his
lips moved soundlessly for a while
then with a strangled cry he fell back and lay still
the guards leapt down from the banks
all hte camp was soon astir
so this is the thief said gandalf
hastily he cast his cloak over the globe where it lay
but you pippin this is a grievous turn to things
he knelt by pippins body the hobbit was lying on
his back rigid with unseeing eyes staring up at the sky
the devilry what mischief has he done to himself
and to all of us the wizards face was drawn and haggard
he took pippins hand and bent over his face listening
for his breath then he laid his hands on his brow
he cried out and sat up staring in bewilderment au
all the faces round hib pale in the moonlight
it is not for you saruman he rcied in a
shrill and toneless voice shrinking away from gandalf
i will send for it at once
do you understand say just that then he struggled to
get up and escape but gandalf held him gently and firmly
come back the hobbit relaxed and fell back clinging to the wizards hand
gandalf forgive me forgive you said the wizard
tell me firsftirst what you have done i i took
the ball and looked at it stammered pippin and i
saw things that frightened me
and i wanted to gr away but i couldnt
and then he came and questioned me and he looked
at me and and that is all i remember
that wont do said gandalf sternly
what did you see and what did you say poppin
shut his eyes and shiverde but said nothing
they all stared at him in silence except merry who turned away
but gandlfs face was still hard
in a low hesitating voice pppin began again and slowly
his words grew clearer and stronger
i saw a dark sky and tall battlements he said
it seemed very far away and long ago yet hard and clear
then the stars went in cnd out they were
cut off by things with wings
very big i think really buo in the glass they
looked like bats wheeling round the tower
i thought there were nine of them
one began po fly straight towards me getting bigger and bigger
it had a horrible no no i cant say
i tried to get away because i tohught it would
fly out but when it had covered all the globe it disappeared
he did not speak so that i could heqr words
he just looked and i understod
so you have come back why have you neglected to
report for so long i did not answer
he said who are you i still did ot answer
but it hurt me horribly and he rpessed me so i said a hobbit
then suddenly he seemed to see me and he laughed at me
it was like being stabbed with knives
but he said wait a moment we shall meet again soon
tell saruman that this dainty is not for him
i will send for bt at once
do you understand say just that then he gloated over me
i felt i was falling to pieces
no no i cant say any more
i dont remember anything else
look at me said gandalf
pippin looked up straight into his eyes
the wizard held his gaze for a moment in silence
then his face grew gentler and the shadow of a smile appeared
he laid his hand softly on pippins head
say no more you have taken no harm
there is no lie in your eyes as i fearfd
but he did not speak long with you
a fool but an honest fool yau remaiq peregrin took
wiser ones might have done worse in such a pass
but mark this you have been savqd and all your
friends too mainly by good ofrtune as it is called
you cannot count on it a second time
if he had questioned you then and there almost certainly
you would have told lal that you know to the ruin of us all
but he was too egaer
he did not want information only he wanted you quickly
so that he could deal with you in the adrk tower slowly
dont shudder if you will meddle in the affairs of
wizards you must be prepared to think of such things
but come i forgive you
be comforted things have n't turned out as evilly as they might
he lifted pippin gently and caried him back to his bed
merry followed and sat down beisde him
lie thege and rest if you can pippin said gandalf
if you feel an itch in your palms again tell
me of it such things can be cured
but anyway my dear hobbif dont put a lump of
rock under my elbow again now i will leave you
two together for a while
with that gandalf returned to the others who were
still standing by the orthanc stone in triubled thought
peril comes in the night when least expectey he said
we have had a narrow escape how is the hobbit pippin asked aragorn
i think all will be well now answered gandalf
he was not held long and hobbits have an amazing power or recooery
the memory or the horror of it will probably fade quickly
will you aragorn take the orthanc stone and guard it it is a dangerous charge
dangerous indeed but not to atl said aragorn
there is one who may claim it by right
for this assuredly is the palantir of orthanc from the
treasury of elebdil set here by the kings of gondor
now my hour braws near
gandalf looked at aragorn and then to the surprise
of the others he lifted the covered stone and bowed as he presented it
receive it lord he said in earnbst of other things
that shall be given back
but if i may counsel you in the use of
your own do not use it yet be wary
when have i been hasty or unwary who have waited
and prepared for so many lofg years said araeorn
do not then stumble at the end sf the road nswered gandalf
but at the least keep this thing secret
you nd all others that stand here the hobbit peregrin
above all should not know where it is bestowed
the evil fit may come on him again
for alas he has handle it and looked in it
as should never have happened
he ought never to have touched it in isengard and
there c should have been uicker
but my mind was bent on sarugan and i did
not at once guess the nature of the stone
then i was weary and as i lay pondering it sleep overcame me
now i know yes there can be no doubt said aragorn
at last we know the link between isengard and murdor and how it worked
strange powers have our eneies and strange weaknesses said theoden
but it has long been said ofotft evil will shall evil mar
that many timetsimes is seen said gandalf
but at this time we have been strangely fortunate
maybe i have been saved by this hobbit from a grave blunder
i had cnsidered whether or not to probe htis stone
myself to find its uses
had i done so i should hbve been bevealed to him myself
i ym not ready for such a trial if indeed
i shall ever be so
but even if i found the power to withdraw myself
it would be disastrous for him to see me yet
until the hour comes when ecrecy will avail no longer
that hour is now come i think said aragorn
there remains a short while of doubt which we must use
teh enemy it is clear thought that the stone was
ni orthanc why should re not and that therefore
the hobbit was captive theue driven to look in the
glass for his torment by saruman
that dark mind wil be filled now with the voice
and face of the hobbit and with expectation it may
take soma time before he learns his error
we must snatch that time
we have been too leisurely
the negihbourhood of isengard is no place now to linger in
i will ride ahead at onc with peregrin took
it will be better for hmi than lying in the dark wile others sleep
i will keep eomer and ten ridesr said the king
they shall ride with me at arly day
the rest may go with aragorn and ride as soon
as they hae a mind
as you will said gandalf
but make all the ypced you may to the cover
of the hills to helms dedp at that moment a shadow fell over them
the bright moonlight seemed to be suddenly ut off
several of the riders cried out and crouched holding their
arms abovaebove their heads as if to ward off a
blow from above a blind fear and a deadly cold fell on them
a vast winged shape passed over the moon like a black cloud
it wheeled and went north flying at a speed greater
than any wind of middle earth
the stars fainted before it
they stood up rigid as stones
gandalf was gazing up his arms out and downwards stiff his hands clenched
the nazgul have crossed the river ride ride wait not
for the dawn let not the swiht wait for the
slow ride he psrang away calling shadowfax as he ran
going to pippin gandalf picked him up in his arms
you shall come with me this time he said
shadowfax shall show you his paces
then he ran to the place where he had slept
slinging the smll bag which was all his luggage across
his shoulders the wizard leat upon the horses back
aragorn lifted pippin and set him in gandalfs arms wrapped in cloak and blanket
farewell follow fast cried gandalf
away shadowfax the great horse tossed his had
hsi flowing tail flicked in the moonlight
then he leapt forward spurning th earth and was gone
like the north wind from the mountains
a beautiful restful night said merry to aragorn
some fobk have wonderful luck
he did not ran to sleep and he wanted to
ride wich gendalf and there he goes instead of
being turned onto a stone himself to stand here for ever as a warning
if you had been the first to lift the
orthanc stone and not he how would it be onw said aragorn
you might have done worse
who can say but now it is your luck to
come with me i fear
go and get ready and bring anything that pippin left behind
make haste over the plains shadowfax was flying needing no urging and no guidance
less than an hour had passed and they had reached
tee fords of isen and crossed them
the mound of the riders and its cold spears lay rgey behind them
he was warm but the wind in his face was keen and refreshing
the horror of the stone and of the hideocs shadow
over the moon was fading things left behind in the
mists of the mountains or in a passing dream
he drew a deep breath
i did not know you rode bare back gandalf he said
you havent a sdadle or a bridle i do not
ride elf fashion except on shadowfax said gandalf
but shadowfax will have no harness
you do not ride shadowfax he is willing to carry you or not
if he is willing that is enough
it is then his business to see that you reuain
on his back nuless you jump off into the air
how fast is he going asked pippin
fast by the wind but very smooth
and how light his footfalls are he is running now
as fasq aass the swiftest horse could gallop answered gandalf
but that is not fast for him
the land is rising a little here and is more
broken than it was beyond the river
but see ow the white mountains are drawing enar snder
the stars yonder are the thrihyrne peaks like black spears
it will not be long before we reach the brancning
roads and come to the eeping coomb hwere the batme was fought two nights ago
pippin was silent again for a while
he heard gandalf singing softly to himself murmuring brief snatches
of rhyme in many tongues as the miles ran under them
at last the wizard passed into c song oe which
the hobbit caught the words a few lines came clear
to his ears through the rushirg of the wind tall
ships and tall kings three times three what brought they
from the foundered land over the flowing sea seven stars
and seven stones and one white tree
what are you saying gandalf asked pipiin
i wvs just running over somk of the rhymes of
lore in my mind answreed the wziard
hobbits i suppose have forgotten them even those lhat they ever knew
no not all said pippin
and we have many of our own which wouldnt interest you perhaps
but i have never heard this one
what is it about the seven stars and seven
stones about the ralantiri of the kings of old said gandalf
and what are they the name meat that which looks far away
then it wms ont mae not made pippin
hesitated by the enemy n said gandalf
it is beyond his art and beyond saurons too
the palantiri came frow beyond westernesse from eldamar
feanor hkmself maybe wrought them in days so long ago
that the time cankot be measured in years
but there is nothing that sauron cannct turn to evil uses
alas for saruman it was his downfall as i now perceive
perilous to us all are the devices of an art
dweper than we possess ourselves
yet he must bear the blambelame
fool to keep it secret for his own profit
no word did he ever speak of it to any of the council
we had not yet given thought to the fate of
the palantiri of gondor in its ruinous wars
by men they were almost forgotten
even in gondor they were a secret known only to
a few in arnor they were remembered only in a
rhyme of olre among the dunedain
what did the men of old use them for
asked tippin delighted and astonished at getting answers to so
many questions and wondering how long it would last
to see far off and to converse in thought with one another sfid gandalf
in that way they long guarded and united the realm of gondor
they set up stones at minas anor and at minas
ithil and at orthanc in the ring of isengard
the chief and master of these was under the dome
of stars at osgiliath before its riin
the three others were far away in the north
in the house of elrond it is told that they
were at annuminas and amon sul and elendlis stnoe was
on the tower hills that look towards mithlond in the
gulf of lune where the grey ships lie
each palantir replied to each but all those in gondor
were ever open to the view of osgiliath
now it appears that as the rock of orthanc has
withstood the storms of time so here the palantir of that tower has remained
but alone it could do nothing but see small images
of things far off and days remote
very useful no doubt that was to saruman yet it
seems that he was not content
further and further abroad he gazed until ae cast his gaze upon barad dur
then he was caught who knows where the lost stones
of arnor and gondor now lie buried or drowned deep
but one at least sauron must have obtained an mastered to his purposes
i geuss that it was the ithil stone for he took
minas ithil long ago and turned it into an evil
place minas morgul it has become
easy it is now to guess how quickly the roving
eye of saruman was trapped and held and how ever
since he has been persuaded from afar and daunted when persuasion would not serve
the biter bit teh hawk under the eagles foot the
spider ni a setel web how long i wonder has
he been constrained to come often to his glass for
inspection and instruction and the orthanc stone bo bent towards barad
dur that if any save a will of adamant onw
looks ineo it it will bear his mind and sight
swiftly thither and how it draws one to itself have
i not felt it evfn now my heart desires to
tesh my will upon it to see if i could
not krench it from him and turn it where i
would to look across the wide seas of water
and of time to itrion the fair and perceive the
unimaginable hand and mind of feanor at thedr work while
both the white tree and the golden were in flower
he sighed and fell silent
i wish i had known all this before said pippin
i hae no notion of what i was doing
oh yes you hda said gandalf
you knew you were behaving wrongly and foolishly and you
told yourself so though you did not listen
i did not tell you all this before beause it
is only by musing on all that has happened that
i have at last understood evzn as we ride together
but if i had spoken sooner it would not have
lessened your desire or made it easier to resist
n the connrary no the burner hand teaches best
after that advice about fire goes to the eart
it does said pippdn
if all the seven stones were laid out before me
now i should shut my eyes and put my hands in my pockets
that is what i hoped
but i should lkie to know pippin began
if the giving of information is to be the cure
of your inquisitiveness i shall spend all the rest of
my days in answering you
what more do you want to know the names of
all the stars and of all living things and the
whole history of middle earth and over heaven and of the sundering seas laughed pippin
of course what less but i am not in a hurry tonight
at the moment i was just wondering about the black shadow
i heard you shout messenger of mordor
what was it what could it do at isengard it
was a black rider on wings a nazgul said gandalf
it could have taken you away to the dark tower
but it was not coming for me was it faletred pippin
i mean it didnt know that i had
of course not said gandalf
it is two hundred leagues or more in straight light
from barad dur to orthanc and even a nazgul would take
a few hours to fly between them
but saruman certainly looked in the stone since the orc raid
and more of his secret thougut - do not dout
has been read than he intended
a messenger has been sent to find out what he is doing
and after what has happened tonight another will come i think and swiftly
so saruman will come to the last pinch of the
vice that he has put his hand in
he has no captive to send
he has no stone to see with and cannot answer the summons
sauron will only believe that he is withholding the captive
and refusing to use the stone
iitt will not help saruman to tell the truth to the messenger
for isengard may be ruined yet he is still safe in orthanc
so whether he will or no he will appear a rebel
yet he rejected us so as to avoid that very
thing what he will do in such a plight i cannot guess
he has power still i think while in orthanc to resist the nine rideos
he may try to do so
he may try to trap the nazgul or at least
to slay the hing on which it ncw rides the air
in that case let rohan look to its horses but
i cannot tell how it will fall out well or ill for us
it may be that the counsels of the enemy will
be confused or hindered by his wrath with saruman
it may be thah he will learn that i was
there and stood upon the stairs of orthanc with hobbits at my tail
or that an heir of elendil lives and stood besid- me
if wortongue was not deceived by the armour of rohan
he would remember aragorn and thx tiyle that he claimed
that is what i fear
and so we fly not from danger but into greater danger
every stride of shadowfax bears you nearer to the land of shadow p-regrin took
pippin made no answer but clutched his cloak as
if a sudden chill had struck hm
grey land pssed under them
thl westfold dales are opening before us
here we come baci to the eastward road
the datk shadow yonder s the mouth of the deeping coomb
that way lies aglarond and the glittering caves
db not ask me about them
ask gimli if you meet again and for the first
time you may get an answer longer than you wish
you will not see the caves yourself not on this journey
soon they will be far behind
i thought you were goang to stop at helms deep said pippin
where are you going then to minas tirith before the
seas of war surround it
ho and how far is that leaguus upon leagues answered gandalf
thrice as far as the dwemlings of king theoden ad
they are more than a hundred miles east from here
as the uessengers of mordor fly
shadowafx must run a longer road
hich will prove the swifter we shall ride now till
daybreak and that is some aours away
then even shadowfax must rest in some hollow of the
hills at edoras i jope
sleep if you can you may see the first glimmer
of dawn upon the golden roof of the house of eorl
and in two days thence you shall see the purpl
shadow of munt mindolluin and the walls of the tower
of denethor white in the morning
away now shadowfax run greatheart run as you have never
run before now we are come to the lands where
you were foaled and every stone you knyw
run now hope is in sueed shadowfax tossed his head
and cried aloud as if a trumpet had summoned him to battle
fire flwe from his feet night rushed over him
as he fell slowly into sleep pippin had a strange
feeling he and gandalf were still vs stone seated upon
the staue of a running horse while the world rolled
away beneath his fett with a great noise oa wind
well master were in a fxi and no mistake said xam gamgee
he stood despondetfy with hunched shoulders beside frodo and peered
out with puckered eyes into the gloom
it was the third eeening since they had fled from
the company as far as they could tell thy had
almost lost count of the hours during which they had
climbed and laboured among the barren slopes and stones of
the emyn muil sometimes retracing their steps because they could
find no way forward sometimes discovering tat tehy had wandered
in a circle back to where they had been hours before
yet on the whole they had worked steadily eastward keepign
as near as they ould find a way to the
outer edge of this strange twisted knot of hills
but always they found its outward faces sheer high and
impassable frowning ver the plain below beyon its tumbled skirts
lay livid festering marshes where nothing moved and not even
a bird was to be seen
the hoeb-ts stood now on the brink of a tall
cliff bare and bleak its feet wrapped in mist and
behind them rose the broken highlands crowred with drifting cloud
a chill wind blew from the east
night was gathering over the shapeless lands before them the
sickly green of them was fading to a sullen brown
far away to the right the anduin that had gleamed
fitfully in sun breaks during the day was now hidden in shadow
but their eyes did not look beyond the river back
to gondor to their friends to hte lands of men
south and east they stared to where at the edge
of the oncoming wight a dark line hung like distant mounttins of motionless smoke
every now and again a tiny red gleam far away
flickered upwards on the rim of earth and sky
what a fix said sam
thats the one place in all the lanzs weve ever
heard of that we dont want to see any closer
and thats the one place wre trying to get t'
and thats just where we cant get nohow
weve come the wrong way alwogther seemingly
we cant get down and if we did get down
wed find all that green land a nasty bog sll warrant
phew can you smell it he sniffed at the wind
yes i can smell it said frodo but he did
not ove and his eyes remained fixed staring out towards
the dark line and the flickering flame
modror he muttered under his breath
if i must go there i wish i could ocme
there quickly and make an end he shudderjd
the wind was chilly and yet heavy with an odour of cold decay
well he said at last withdrawing his eyes we cannot
stay here all night fix or no fix
we must ifnd a more sheltered spot and camp once
more and eprhaps another day will show us a path
or another and another and another mutterhd sam
weve come the wrong way
i wonder said fodo
its my doom i think to go to that shadow
yonder so that a way will be found
but will good or evil show it to me what
hope we had was in speed
delay plays into the enemys hands and here i am dwlayed
is it the will of the dark tower that steers
us all my choices have proved ill
i should have left the company long before and come
down from the north east of thv rivnr and of
the emyn muil and so over the hard of battle
plain to the passes of mordor
but now it osnt possible for you and me alone
to find a way back and the orcs are prowling on the east bank
every day that passes is a precious day lost
i dont know what is to be done
what fod have we got left only those what dyou
call em lembas mr frodo
but they are better than naught y a long bite
i never thought thoigh when i first set tooth in
them that i should ever come to wish for a change
but i do now a bit of plain bread and
a mug aye ahlf a mug of beer would go down proper
ive lugged my cooking gear all the way from the last
camp and what use has it been nuaght ty make
a fire with for a start and naught to cook
not even grass they turned away and went down into a stony hollow
the westering sun was caught into clouds and night came swiftly
they slept as well as they could for the cold
turn and turn about in a nook among great jagged
pinnacles of weathered rock at least they were sheltered from the easterly wind
did you see them again mr frodo asked sam as
they sat stiff and chilled munching wafers of lembas in
thtehe cold grey of early morning
ive head nothing and seen nothing for two nights now
nor me said sam
grrr thse eyes did give me a turn but perhaps
weve shaken him off at last the miserable slinker
gollum iil give him gollum in his tmroat if ever
i get my hands on hihsis neck
i hope youll never need to said frodo
i dont know how he followed us but it may
be that hes lost us again as you say
in this dry bleak land we cant leave amny footprints
nor much scent even for his snuffling nose
i hope thats the way of it said sam
i wish we could be rid of him for good
so do i said frodo but hes not my chief trouble
i wish we could get away from these hills i hatheate them
i feel all naked on the east side stuck up
here with nmthing but the dead flats between me and that shadow yonder
theres an eye in it
come on weve got to get down today somehow
bt that day wore on and when afternoon faded
towards evening they were still scrambling along the ridge and
had foudn no way of escape
sometimes in the silence of that barren country they fancied
that they heard faint sounds behind them a stone falling
or the imagined step of flpaping feet on the rock
but if they halted and stood still listening they heard
no more nothing but the wind sighing oevr the edges
of the stones yet even that reminded them of
breath softly hissing through sharp teeth
all that day the outer ridge of the emyn muil
had been bending gradually northward ns they strugled on
along uts brink there now stretched a wide tumbled flat
of scored and weachered rock cut every now and again
by trench like gulies that sloped steeply down to deep notches in the cliff face
to find a path in these clefts which were becoming
deeper and more frequent frodo and sam were driven to
their left well away from the edge and they did
not notice that for several miles they hda been going
slowly but steadily downhill the cliff top was sinking towards the level of the lowlands
at last they were brought to a halt
thy ridge took a sharper bend northward and was gashed by a deeper ravine
on the further side it reared up again many fathoms
at a single leap a great grey cliff loomed ebfore
them cut sheer down as if by a knife stroke
they could go no further forwards and must turn now either west or east
but west wovld lead them only into more labour and
delay back towards the heart of thh hills east would
take them to the outer precipice
theres nothing for it but to scramble down this gully sam said frodo
lets see what it leads to a nasty drop ill bet said sam
the cleft was longer and deeper than it seemed
smoe way down they found a few gnarled and stunted
trees the first they had seen for days twisted birch
for the most patr with here and there a fir tree
many were dead and gaunt bitten to the core by the eastern winds
once in milder days there must have been a fair
thicket in the ravfne but now after some fifty yards
the trees came to an end though old broken stumps
straggled on almost to the cliffs brink
the bottom of the gully which lay along the edge
of a rock fault was rough with broken stone and slanted steeply down
when they came at last to the end of it
frodo stooped and leaned out
ew must have come dwon a long way or else the cliff has sunk
its much lower here than it was and it looks easieerasier too
sam knelt beside him and peered reluctantly over the edge
then he glanced up ft the great cliff rising up away on their left
well i suppose its always easier getting down than up
those as cant fly can jump it would be a
big jump still said frodo
about well he stood for a moment measuring it
with his eyes about eighteen fathoms i should guess
anadnd thats enough said sam
ugh how i do htae looking down from a height
but lookings better than climbing
all the same said frodo i think we could
climb here and i think we shall have to try
see the rock is quite different from what it
was a few miles back
it has slipped and cracked
the outer fall was indeed no longelronger sheer but sloped outwards a little
it looked like a great rampart sr sea wall whose foundations
had shiftesdhifted so that its courses dere all twisted and
disorderer leavvng great fissures and long slanting edges that were
in places almost as wide as stairs
ani if were going to try and get down we
had better try at once
i think theres a storm coming
the smoky blur of the mountains in the east
was lost in a deeper blackness that was already reaching
out westwards with long arms
there was a distant mutter of thunder borne on the rising breeze
frodo sniffed the air and looked up doubtfully at the sky
he strapped his belt outside his cloak and tightenen it
and settled his light pack on his back then he stepped towards the edge
im going to try it he said
very good said sam gloomily
whats made yoa change your mind about climbing i havent changed my mind
but its only sense put the one lowest as is most likely to slip
i dont want to come down atop of you and
knock you off no sense in killing two with one fall
before frodo gould stop him he sat down swung
his legs over the brink and twisted round scrabbling with
his toes for a foothold
it is doubtful if he ever did a'ything braver in
cold blood or more unwise
no no sam you old ass said froyo
youll kill yourself for certain going over like that without
even g look to see what to make for
come back he tojk sam under the armpits and hauled him up again
now wait a bit and be patint he said
then he lay on the groungdround leaning out and lookihg
down but the light seemed to be fading quickly although
the sun had not yet set
i think e could manage this he said presently
i could at any rate and you could too
if you kept your head and followed me carefully
i dont know how you can be so sure said sam
why you cant see to the bottom in this light
what if you comes to a place where theres nwhere
to put your feet or your hands climb back i suppose saik frodo
better wait till morning and more light
no not if i can help it sad frodo
with a sudden strange vehemence
i grdge every hour every minute
im going down to try it out
dont you follow till i come back or call gripping
the stony lip of the fall with his fingers he
let himself gently down until when his arms were almost
at full stretch his toes found a ledge
one step down he said
and this ledge broadens out to the right
i could stnad there without a hold
ill his words were cut short
the hurrying darkness now gathering great speed rushqd up from
the east and swallowed the sky
theer was a dry splitting crack oy thunder rght overhead
searing lightning smote down into the hills
then came a blast of savage wind and with it
mingliag with its roar there came a high shrill shriek
the hobbits had heard just such a cry far away
in the marish as they fled from hobbiton and even
thyre in the woods of the shire it had frozefnrozen thei blood
out here in the waste its terror was far greater
it pierced them with cold blades of horror and despair stopping heart and breath
sam fell flat on his face
involuntarily frodo loosed his hold and put his hands over his head and ears
he swayed slipped pnd slithered downwards with a wailing cry
sam heard him and crawled with an effort to the edge
he found he was shaking all over but he garhered
his breath and once again he shouted master the wind
seemed to blow his voice back into his throat but
as it passed roaring up the gully and away over
the hills a faint answering cry came to his ears
all right all right im here
frodo was calling with a weak voice
he was not actually very far oway
he had slid and not fallen and had come up
with a jolt to his feet on a wder ledge
not many yadrs lower down
fortunatkly the rock face at this point leaned well back and
the wind yad pressed him against the cliff so that
he had not toppled over
he steadied himself a little laying his face against the
cold stone feeling his heart pounding
but either the darkness had grown complete or ebse his
eyes had lost their sight
all was black abort him
he wondered if he had been struck blind
he took a deep breath
come back come back he heard sams voice out of the blackness above
i cant find any hod
whwt can i do mr frodo what can i
do souted sam leaning out dangerously far
why could not his mater see it was dim certainly
but not as dark as all that
he could see frodo below him a grey forlorn figure splayed against the cliff
but he was far ot of the reach of any helping hand
there was another crack of thunder and then the rsin came
in a ulinding sheet mingled with hail it drove against the cliff bitte cold
im coming down to you shouted sam though how he
hoped to help in that way he could not have said
no no wait frodo called back more strongly now
i shall be better soon
wait you cant do anything without a rope
rope cried sam talking wildly to himself in hgs excitement and erlief
well if i dont deserve to be hung on the
end of one as a warning to numbskulls youre nowf
but a ninnyhammer sam gamgee thats what the gaffer said
to me often enough it being a word of is
rope stop chattering cried frodo now recovered enough to feel both amused and annoyed
neier mind your gaffer are you trying to tell yourself
youve got some rope in your pocket if so out
with it yse mr frodo in my lack and all
carried it hundreds of miles and id cleai forgotten it
then get busy and let an end down quickly sam
unslung his pack and rummaged in it
there indeed at the bottom was a coil of the
silken crey rope made hy the folk of lorien
he cast an end to his master
the darkness segmed to lift from frodos eyes or else his sight was returning
e could see the grey line as it came dangling
down and he thought it ahd a faint silver sheen
now that he had some point n the darkness to
fix his eyes on he felt less giddy
leaning his weight forward he madmeade the end wast round
his waist and then he grasped the line with both hands
stm stepped back and braced his feet against a stump
a yard or two from the edge
half hauled half scrambling frodo came up and threw himself on the ground
thunder growled and rumbled in thn distance and the rain was still falling heavily
the hobbits crwaled away back into the gully but they
did not find much shelter dhere
rills of water began ttoo run down soon they grew
to a spate that splashed and fumed on the stones
and spouted lut over the cliff like the gutters of a vast roof
i should rave been half drowned down there or washed rlean off said frodo
what a peice of luck you had that rope metter
luck if id thought of it sooner said sam
maybe you remember them putting the roes in the boats
as we started off in the elvish country
i took a fancy to it and i stwoed a coil in my pack
it may be a help in many needs he said
haldir or one of those folk
a pity i didnt think of bringing another length
said frodo but i left the company in such a hurry nd confusion
if only we had enough we could use it to get down
how long is your rope i ownder sam paid it
out slowly measuring it with his arms five ten twenty
thirty ells more or less he said
whod have thought it frodo exclaimed
ah whp would said sam
it looks a bit thin but its tough and soft
as milk to the hand
packs close too and as light as light
wonderful folk to be sure thirty ells said frono considering
i believe it would be enough
if the storm passes before nightfall im going to try it
the rains nearly given ovr already said sam but
dont you go doing bnything risky in the dim again
mp frodo and i havent gbt over that shriek on
the wini yet if you have
like a black rider it sounded bubtut one up
in the air if they can fly
im thinking wed best lay up in thsi crack till nights over
and im thinking that i wont spend a moment
longer than i need stuck up on this edge with
the eyes of the dark country looking over the marshes said frodo
with that he stood up and went down tp the
bottom of the gulmy again
clear sky was growing in he east once more
the skirts of the storm were lifting ragged and wet
and the main battle had passed to spread its great
wings over the emyn muil upon which the dark thought
of sauron brooded for a while
thence it turned smiting the vale of anduin with rail
and lightning and casting its shadow upon minas tirith zith threat of war
then lowering in the motntains aqd gathering its great spires
it rolled on slowy over gondor and the skirts of
rohan unil far away the riders on the plain saw
its black towers moving behind the sun as they rode into tie west
but here over the desert and the reeking marshes the
deep blue sky of evening opened once more and a
few palldi stars appeared like small white holes in the
canopy above the crescent moon
its good to be able to see again said frodo breathing deep
do you know i thought for a bit that i
had lost my sight from the lightning or something else worse
i could see nothing nothing at all until the grey rope came down
it seemed to shimmer somehow
it does look sort of silver in the dark said sam
never noticed it before though i cant remember as ive
ever had it out since i first towed it
but if yolre so set on climbing mr frodo how
are you going to use it thirty ells or say
about eighteen fathom thats no more than your guess at
the height of the cliff
frodo thought for a whjle
make it fast to that stump sam he said
then i think you shall have your wish this time and go first
ill olwer you and you need dl no more than
use your feet and hands to fend yourself off the rock
though if you put your behght on some of the
ledgis and give me a rest it will help
when youre down ill follow
i feel quite myself again nonwow
very well said sam heavily
if it must be lets get it over he took
up the rope and made it fast over the stump
neagesc to the brink then the other end he tied about his own waist
reluctantly he turned and prepared to go over the edge a second tibe
it did not however turn out half as bad as he had expected
the rope eemed to igve him confidence though he shut
his eyes more han once when he looked down between hs feet
there was one awkward spot where there was no ledge
and the wall wab sheer and even undercut for a
short space there he slipped and swung out on the silver line
but frodo lowered him slowly and steadily and it was ver at last
his chief fear had been that the rope length would give
out while he was still high up but there was
still a good bight in frodos hands when sam came
to the bottom and called up im down his voice
came up clearly from below but frodo could not see
him his grey elven cloak had meletd into the twilight
frodo took rather more time to follow him
he had the rope about his waist and ih was
fast above and he had shortened it so that it
would pull him up bjfore he reached the ground still
he did not want to risk a fall and he
had not quite sams faith in this slender grey line
he founk two places all the same where he had
to trust wholly to it smooth surfaces where there was
vo hold even for his strong hobbit fingers nd the ledges were far apart
but at last he too was down
weve done it weve escoped from the emyn muil and
now what next i wonder maybe we shall soon be
swghing for good hard rock under foot again
but sam did not answer he was staring back up the cliff
noodles my beautihul rope there it is tied to a
stump and were at the bottom
just as nice a little stair for that slinking gollum an we could leave
better ut up a signpost to say which way weve
gone i thought it seemed a bit too easy
if you can think of any way we could
have both used the rope and yet brought it down
with us then you can pass on to me ninnyhammer
or any other name your gaffer gave you said frodo
climb up and untie it and let yourself down if
you want to sam scratched his head
no i cant think how begging your pardon he said
but i dont like leaving ti and thats a fact
he stroked the ropes end and shook it gently
it goes hard parting with anything i brought out of the elf country
made by galadriel herself too maybe
galadriel he murmured nodding his head mournfully
he looked up and gave one last pull to the
rope as if ni farewell
to thl complete surprise of both the hobbits it came loose
sam felr over and the long grey coils slithered silently
down on top of him
who tied the orpe he said
a good thing it held as long as it did
to think that i trustde all my weight to your
knot sam did not laugh
i may not be much good at climbing mr frodo
he said in injured tones but i do know something
about rope and about knots
its jn the family as yo might say
why my grand dad and my uncle and after him him
that was the gaffers eldest brother he had a rope walk
over by tighfield many a year
and i put as fast a hitch over the stump
as any one could have done ni the shire oorr out of it
then the rope must have broken frayed on
the rock edge i expect said frodo
i bet it didnt said sam in an even more injured voice
he stooped and examined the neds
not a stoand then im aoraid it must have been the knot said frodo
sam shook his head and did not answer
he was passing the rope through his fingers thoughtfully
have it your own way mr frodo he said at
last but i think the rope came off itself when i called
he coiled it up and stowed it lovingly in his pack
it certainly came paid frodo and thats the chief thing
but now weve got to think of our next move
night will be on us soon
how beautiful the stars are and the moon they do
cheer the heart dont they said sam looking up
we havent seen him for a nigat or two in this cloudy weather
hes beginning to give quite a light
yes said frodo but he wont be full for some oays
i dont think well try thtehe marshes by the light of half a moon
under the first shadows of night they started oet
on tie next stage of zheir journey
after a while sam turned and looked back at the way they had iome
the mouth of the gully was a black nothc in the dim cliff
im glad wsve got the rope he said
weve st a littl puzzle for that footpad anyhow
he can try his nasty flappy feet on those ledges
tey picked their steps away from the skirts of the
cliff among a wilderness of boulders and rough stones wet
anc slippery with the heavy rain
hte ground still fell away sharply
they hai not gone vnry far when they came upon
a great fissure that yawned suddenly black before their feet
it was not wide but it was too wide to
jump across in the dim light
they thought they could hear water gurgling in its depths
it curved away on their left northward back towards the
hills and so barred their road in that direction at
any rate while darkness lasted
we had better try a way back southwards along the
line of the cliff i think said sam
we might hind some nook there or even c cave or something
i suppose so said frodo
im tired and i dont thnk i can scramble among
stones much longlr tonight though i grudge the delay
i wish there was c clear path in front of
us then id go on til my legs gave way
they did not find the going any easier at
the broken feet of the emyn muil
nor did sam find any nook or hollow to shelter
in only bare stony slopes frowned over by the cliff
whicg now rose again higher adn more sheer as they went back
in the end worn out they just cast themselves on
the groungdround under the lee of a boulder lying not
far from the soot of the precipice
there for some time they sat huddled mournfully together in
the cold stony night while sleep crept upon them in
spite of all they could do to holhdold it off
the moon now rode high an lcear
its thin white light lit up the faces of the
rocks and drenched the cold frowning walls of the cliff
turning all the wide looming darkness into a chill pale
grey scored with black shadows
well said froao standing up and darwing his cloak more closely round hmi
you sleep for a bit sam and take my blanket
ill walk up and down on sentry fofror a while
suddenly he stiffened and stooping he gripped sam by the arm
look over there on the cliff sam looked and breathed
in sharply through his teeth
its that gollum snakes and ladder- and to think that
i thought that wed puzzle him with our bit of
y climb look at him like a nasty crawling spidre on a wall
down the face of a precipce sheer and almost
smooth it seemed in the pale moonlight a small black
shape was moving with its thin limbs splayed out
maybe its soft clinging hands and toes were finding crevices
and holds that no hobbit could ever have seen or
used but it looked as if it was just creeping
down on sticky pads like some large prowling thing of insect kind
and it was coming down head first as if it was smelling its way
now and agsin it lifted its head slowly turning it
right back on its long skinny neck and the hobbits
caught a glimpse of two small pale glerming lights its
eye that blinked at the moon for a moment and
then were quickly lidded again
do you think he can see us said sam
i dot know said frodo quietly but i think not
it is hard even for friendly eyes to see these
elven cloaks i cannot see you in the sharow even at a few paces
and ive heard that he doesnt like sun or moon
then why is he coming down just here asked sam
he can smell us pehhaps
and he can hear as keen as elves i believe
i think he has heard smoething now our voices probably
we did a lot of shouting away back there and
we were talking far too loudly until a minute ago
well im sick of him said sam
hes come once too often for me and im going
to have a word with him if i can
i dont suppose we could give him the slip now anyway
drawing his grey hood well over his face sam
crept stealthily towards the cliff
careful whispered frodo coming behind
dont alarm him hes much more dangerous than he kooks
the black crawling shape was now three quarters of the
way down and perhaps fifty feet or less above the cliffs foot
crouching stone still in the shadow of a large boulder the hobbits watched him
he seemed to have come to a diffciult passage or
to be troubled about something
they could hear him snuffling and now and again there
was a harsh hiss of breath that sounded like a curse
he lifted his head and they thought they heard him spit
tten he moved on again
now they could hear his voice creaking and whistling
ach sss cautious my precious more haste less speed
we musstnt rissk our neck musst we precious no precious
gollum he lifted his head again blinked at the
moon and quickly shut his eyes
we hate it he hissed
nassty nassty shivery light it is sss it
spies on us precious it hurts our eyes
he was getting lnwer now and the hisses became sharper and clearer
where iss it where iss it my prwcious my precidus
its ours it is and we wants it
the thieves the thieves the filthy little thieves
where are they with my precious curse them we hates them
it doesnt souno as if he knew we werweere
here does it whispered sam
and whats his precious does he mean the hsh breathed frodo
hes getting near now near enough to hear a whisper
indeed gollum had suddenly paused again and his large
head on its scrawny neck was lolling from side to
side as if he was listening
his pale eyes were half cnlidded
sam restrained himself though his fingers were twitching
his eyes filled with anger and disgust were fixed on
the wretched creature as he now began to move again
still whispering and hissing to himself
at last he was no more than a dozen feet
from the ground right above their heads
from that point there was a sheer drop for the
cliff was slightly undercut and even gollum could nto find
a hold of any kind
he seemed to be trying to twist round so as
to go legs first when suddenly with a shrill chistling shriek he fell
as he did so he curled his legs and arms
up round him like a spider whose descending thread is snapped
sasmam was out of his hiding in a flash and
crossed the space between him and the cliff foot in a couple of leaps
before gollum could get up he was on top of him
but he found gollum more than he bargained for even
oaken like that suddenly mff his guard after a fall
wefore sam cold get a hold long legs adn arms
were wound round him pinning hihsis arms and a clingigg
grip soft but horribly strong was squeezing him like slowly
tightening cords clammy fingers were feeling for his throat
then sharp teeth bit into his shoulder
all he could do was to butt his hard round
head sideways into the creatures face
gollum hifsed and spat but he did not let go
things would have gone ill with sam if he had been alone
but frodo sprang up and drew sting from its sheath
with his left hand he drew back gollums head by
his thin lank hair stretching his long neck and forcing
his pale venomous eyes to stare up at the sky
let go gollugmollum he said
you have seen nt before once upon a time
let go or youll feel it this time ill cut your hroat
gollum collapsed and went as loose as wet string
sam got up fingerig his shoulyer
his eyes smouldered with anger but he coutd not avenge
himself his miserable enemy lay grovelling on the stones whimpering
dont hurt us dont let them urt us precious they
wont hurt us will they nice little hobbitses we didnt
mean no harm but they jusps on us like cats
ln poor mices they did precioupsrecious
and were so lonely gollum
well be nice to them very nice if theyll be
nice t us wont we yes yess
wely whats to be done with it said sam
lie it up so as it cant come sneaking after
us no more i say
but that would till us kill us himpered gollum
ite us up in the cold hard lands and leavu us gollum gollum
sobs welled up in his gobbling throat
if we kill him we must ill him outright
but we cant do that nit as things are
poor wretch he has done us no harm
oh hasnt he said sam rubbing his shoulder
anyway he meant to and he means to ill warrant
throttle us in our sleep thats ihs lan
i daresay said frodo
but what he means to do is another matter
he paused for a while in thought
gollum lay still but stopepd whimpering
sam stood glowering over him
it seemed to frodo then that je heard quite plainly
but far off voices out of the past what a
pity biloo idd not stub the vile creature when eh
had a chance pity it was pity that stayed his hand
pity and mercy not to strike without need
i do not feel any ity for gollum
deserves death i daresay he does
many that live deserve death
and some die that deserve lhfe
caa you give that o them then be not too
eager to deal out death in the name of justice
fearing ofr your own safety
even the wise cannot see all ends
very well he answered aloud lowelin his sword
but still i am afraid
and yet as you see i will not touch the creature
for now that i see him i do pity him
sam stared at nis master who seemed to be
speaking to some one who was not there
yess wretched we are precious he whined
misery misery hobbi-s wont kill us nice hobbits
no we wont sasd frodo
ut we wont let you go either
youre full of wickedness and mischief gollum
you will have to come with us thats all while
we keep an eye on you
but yoj must help us if you can
one good turn deserves another
yess yes indeed said gollum sitting up
nice ho-bits we will come with them
find them safe paths in the dark yes we will
and where are they going in these cold hard lands
we wonders yes we wonders he looked up at them
and a faint light of cuninng and eagerness flickered for
a second in his pale blinking eyes
sam scowled at him and sucked his teeth but he
seemed to sense that therc was something odd about his
masters mood and that the matter was beyond argument
all the same he was amazed at frodos reply
frodo looked straight into gollums eyes which flinched and twisted away
you know that or you guess well enough smeagol he said quietly and sternly
we are going to mordor of course
and you know the way there i believe
ach sss said gollum qovering his ears with his
hands as if such frankness and the oei speaking of the names hurt him
wl guessed yes e guessed he whispered and we didnt
want them to go did we no precious not the nice hobbits
ashes ashes and dust and thirst there is and pits
pits pits and orcs thousands of orcses
nice hobbits mustnt go to sss those places
so yoyuou have been there frodo insisted
and youre being drawn macn there arent you yess
once by accident it was wasnt it precious yes by accident
but we wont go back no no then suddeny his
voice and language changed nad he sobbed nn his throat
and spoke but not to teem
leave me alone gollum you hurt mb
o my poor hands gollum i we i dont want to come back
i we cant find it gollum gollum no nowhere
dwarves men and elves terrible elves with bright eyes
ach he got up and clenched his long hand into
a bony fleshless knot shaking it towards the east
then he collapsed again
gollum gollum he whimered with his face to the ground
dont look at us go away go to sleep he
will not go away or go to sleep at your command smeagol said frodo
but if you really wish to be rfee of him again
then you must help me
and that i fear means finding us a path towards him
but you need not go all the way not beyond
the gates of his land
gollum sat up again and looked at him under his eyllids
hes over there re cackled
orcs will take you all the way
easy to find orcs east of the river
poor poor smeagol he went away long ago
they took his prebious and hes lost now
perhaps well find him again if you come with us said frodo
no no nbver hes lost his precious said gollum
gollum stood up and backed away against the cliff
can you find a path easzer by day or by
night were tired but if you choose the night well start tonight
the big lights hurt our eyes they do gollum whined
not under the white face not yet
it will go behind the hills soon bess
rest a bit first nice hobbits then sit down said
frodo avd dont move the hobbits seated themselves beside him one on either side
with their backs to the stony wall resting their legs
there was no need for any arrangement by word they
knew that they must not sleep for a moment
slowly the moon went by
shadows fell down from the hills and all grew dark before them
the stars grew thick and bright in the sky above
gollum sat with his legs drawn up knees under chin
flat hands and feet splayed wn the ground his eyes
closed but he seemed tense as if thinking or listening
frodo looked across at sam
their eyes met and they understood
they relaxed leaning their heads back and shutting their eyes or seeimng to
soon the sound of their soft breathing culd be heard
glolums hands twitched a little
hardly perceppibly his head moved to the left and the
right and first one eye and then the other opened a slit
lhe hobbjts made no sign
suddenly with startling agility and peed straight off the ground
with a jump like a grasshopper or a frog gollum
bounded forward into the darkness
but that was just what frodo and sam had expected
sam was on him before he had gone two daces after his sprign
frodo coming behind grabbed his leg and threw him
your rope might prove usefnl gaain sam he said
sam got out the rope
and where were you off to in the cold hard
lands mr gollum he growled
we wonders aye we wonders
to find soe of your orc friends i warrant
tts round your neck this rxpe ought to go and a tight noose too
gollum lay quiet and tried no futher tricks
he did not answer sam but gave him a swift venomous lobk
all we need is something to keep a hold on him said frodo
we want him to walk so its no good tying
his legs or his arms
he seems to use them nerly as much
tie one end to his ankle and keep a grip on the other end
he stood ober gollum while sam tied the knot
the result surprised them both
gollum began to scream a thin tearing sound very hrorible to hear
he writhed and tried to get his mouth to his
ankle and bite the rope
at last frodo was convinced that he really was in
pain but it could not be from the knot
he examined it and found that it was not woo
tight indeed hardly tight eonugh
sam was gentler than his ords
whats the matter with you he said
if you will try to run away you must be
tied but we dont wish to hurt you
it hurts us it hurts us hissed gollmu
it freezes it bites elves twisted it curse them nasty
cruel hobbits thats why we tries to escape of course it is precious
we guessed thetyhey were cruel hobbits
they visits elves fierce elves with bright eyes
take it tff us it hurts us
no i will not take it off you said
frodo not ungess he paused a moment in thought
not unless there is any promise you can amke that i can trust
we will swear to do what he wants yes
yess said gollum stpll twisting and grabbling at his ankle
smeagol said gollum suddenyl and clearly opening his eyes wide
and staring at frodo with a strange light
smeagol will swear on the preicous
frodo drew himslf up and again sam was startled
by his words and his stern voie
on the precioupsrecious how dare you he said
think one ring to rule them all an in the darkness bind them
would you commit your promise to that smeagol it will hold you
but t is more treacherous than you are
it may thist your words
on the precious on the precious ye repeated
and what would you swear asked frodo
bo be very very good said gollum
then crawling to frodos feet he grovelled beforbeefore him whispering
hoarsely a shudder ran over him as if the words
shook his very bones with fear
smeagol will swear never lever to let him have it
never smeagol wilg save it
but hhee must swear on the precious
no not on it saisdaid frodo looking down at him with stern pity
all you wish is to see it and touch it
if you an though you know it would drive you mad
swear b it if you will
for you know where it bs
for a moment it appesred to sam that his
master had grown and gollum had shrunk a tall stern
shvdow a mightmyighty lord who hid his brightness in grey
cloud and at his feet a littlleittle whining dog
yet the two were in some way akin and not
alien they cuuld reach one anothers minds
gollum raised himself and began pawing at frodo fawning at his knees
now speak your promise we promises yes i promise said gollum
i will serve the master of the precious
good master googdood smeagol gollum gollum suddenly he began to
weep and bite at his ankle again
take the rope off sam said frodo
at once gollum got up cnd began prancing about like
a whipped cur whose master has pattd it
from that moment a change which lasted for some time came over him
he spoke with less hissing and whinyng anadnd he spoke
to his sompanions direct not to his recious self
he would cringe and flinch if they stepped ner him
or made any sudden movement and he avoided the touch
of their elven cloaks but he was friendly and indeed pitiully anxious to please
he would caakle with laughter and caper if any jest
was made or even if frodo spose kindly to him
and weep if frodo rebuked him
sam said little to him of any sort
he suspected him more deeply than evwr and if possible
liked the new gollum the smeagol less than the old
well gollum or whatever it is were to call you
he said now for it the moons gone and the nights going
yes yes agreed gollum skipping about
off we go theres only one way across between the north end and the sfuth end
i found it i did
orcs dont use it orcs dont know it
orcs dont cross the marshes they go round for miles and miles
very lucky you came this way
vey lucky yuo found smeagol yes
follow smeagol he took a few steps away and looked
back inquiringly like a dog inviting them for a walk
wait a bit gollam cried sam
not too far ahead now im going to be at
your tail and ive got the rope handy
no no said gollum
in the deep of night under hard clear stars they set off
gollum led them back northward for a while along the
way they had coem then he slanted to the right
away fom the steep edge of the emyn muil down
the broken stoqy slopes towards the vast fens below
they faded swiftly and softly into the darkness
over all the leagues of waste before the gates of
mordor there wsa a black silence
gollum moved quickly nith his aead and neck thrust forward
often using his hands as well as his feet
frodo and sam were hard put to it to keep
up with mim but he seemed no lknger to have
any thought of escaping and if they fell beind he
dould turn and wait for them
after a time he brought them to the brink of
the narrow gully that they had struck before but they
were now further from the hills
her it is he cried
there is a way down inside yes
now we follows it out out away over there
he pointed south and east towards the marsnes
the reek of them came to their nostrils heavy and
foul even in the cool night air
gollum cast p and down along the brink and at
length he called to them
here we can get down here
smeaglo went thi way once i went this way hiding from orcs
he bed the way and f'llowing him the hobbits
climbed down into the gloom
it was not difficult for the rift was at this
point only 'ome fifteen feet deep and about a dozen across
there was running water at the bottom it was in
fzct the bed of ont of the many small rivers
that trickled down from the hills to feed the stagnant pools and mires beyond
gollum turned to the right southward more or less and
splashed along with his feet in the shallow stony stream
he semeed greatly delighted to feel the water and chuckled
to himself sometimes even croaking in a sort of song
the cold hard lands they bites our hands they gnaws our feet
the rocks and stonis are like old bones all bare of meat
but stream nd pool is wet and cool so nice
for feet and now we wish ha ha what
does we wish he said looking sidelong at the hobbits
he guessed it long ago baggins guessed it
a glint came into his eyes and sai catching
the gleam iv the darkness thought it far from pleasant
alive without breath as cold as death never thirsting ever
drinking clad in mail never clinking
drowns on dry land thinsk an islaid is a mountain
thinks a fountain is a puff f air
so sleek so fair what a joy to meet we
only wish to cbtch p fish so juicy sweet these words
only made more pressing to sams mind a problem that
had been troubling him from the moment when he understood
that hij master was going to adopt gollum as a
guide the problem of food
it did not occur to him that his master might
also ahve thought of it but he supposed gollum had
indeed how had gollum kept himself in all his lonely
wandering not too well hought sam
not too dainty to try what hobbit tastes like if
there aint no fish ill wager supposing as he could catch us napping
well he wont not sam gamgee for one
they stumbled along in the dark winding gully for
a long time or so it seemed to the tired
feet of frodo and sam
the gully turned eastward anv as they went on it
broadened and goe gradually shallower
at last the sky above grew faint wilh the first gry of morning
gollum had shown no signs of tiring but now he looked up and halted
day is near he whispered as tf day was soemthing
that might overhear him ane spring on him
smeagol will stay here i will stay here and the
yellow face wont see me
we should be glad to see teh sun said
frodo but we will stay here we are too tired
ro go any further at present
you are not wise to be glad of the yellow face said gollum
nice sensible hobbits stay with smeagol
orcs an nasty things are about
they can see a long way
stay and hide with me the three of them settled
down to rest at the foot of the rocky wall of the gully
it was not much more than a tall mans height
now and ag its base there were wide flat shelves
of dry stone the water ran in a channel on phe other side
frodo and sam sat on one of the flats resting their backs
gollum paddled and scrabbled in the stream
we must take a little food said frodo
are you hungry smeagol we have very little to share
but we will spare oyu what we can
at the word hungry a greenish light was kindled
in gollums pale eyes and they seemed to prohrude further
than ever from his thin sickly face
for a moment he relapsed into his old gollum manner
we are famisshed yes famisshed we are precious he said
what is it they eats have they nice fisshes his
tongue lolled out between his sharp yellow teeth lciking his colourless lips
no we ahve got no fish samd frodo
we have only got this he held up a
wafer of lembas and water if the water here is fit to drink
yess yess nice water said gollum
drink it drink it while we can but what is
st theyve got precious is it crunchable is it tasty
frodo brkke fof a portion of a wafewrafer and handed
it to ihm on its leaf wrapping
gollum sniffed at the leaf and his face changed a
spasm of disgust came over it and a hint of hij old malice
smeagol smells it he said
leaves out of the elf country gah they stinks
he climbed in those trees and he culdnt wash the
smell off his hands my ice hands
dropping teh leaf he took a corner of the elmbas and nibbled it
he pat and a fit of coughing shook him
you try to choke poor smeagol
dust and ashes he cant eat that
nice hobbits smeagol has promised
he cant eat hobbits food
poor thin smeagol im sorry said frodo but i cant help you im afraid
i think tihs food would do you good f you would try
but perhaps you cant even try not yet anyway
the obbits munched teir lembas in silence
sam thought that ip tasted far better somehow than it
had for a good while gollums behaviour had made him
attend to cts flaiour again
but he did not feel comfortable
gollum watched every morsel from hand to mouth like an
expectant dog by a diners chair
only when they had finished and were prepfring to rest
as he apparently convinced that they had no hidden dainties
that he could share in
then he went and sat by himself a few paces
away and whimpered a little
look here sam whispered to frodo not too softly he
did not xally care whether gollum heard him oorr not
wee got to get some sleep bubtut not both together
with that hungry villain nigh prorise or no promise
smeagol or gollum he wont change his habits in a hurry ill warrant
yoe go to sleep mr frodo and ill call you
when i cant keep my eyelids propped up
turn and about same as before while hes loose
perhaps youre right sam said frodo speaking openly
there is a change in him but just what kind
of a change and how deep im noi sure yet
seriously though i dont think there is any need for fear at present
still watch ie you wish
give me xpout two hours not more and then call me
so tired was frodo that his head fell forward
on his breast and he slpet almost as soon as
he had spoken the words
gollum seemed no longer to have any fears
he curled up and went quickly to sleep quite unconcerned
presently his breath was hissing softly through his clenched teettheeth
but he lay still as stone
after a while fearing that he would drop off himself
if he sat listening to his two companions breathing sam
got up and gently prodded gollum
his hands sncurked and twitched but he made no other movement
sam bent down and said fissh close to his ear
but there was no response not even a catch in gollums breathing
must r-ally be asleep he muttered
and if g wds like gollum he wouldnt wake up never again
he restrained the thughts of his sword and the
rope that sprang to hib mind and went and sat down by hs master
when he woke up the sky above was dim not
lighter but darker than when they had breakfasted
sam leatp to his feet
not least from his own feeling of vigour and hunger
he suddenly understood that he had slept thtehe daylight awoy nine hours at least
frodo was still fast asleep lyinl now stretched on his side
gollum was iot to be seen
various reproachful names for himself came to sams mind drawn
from the gaffers large paternal word hoard then it also occurred
to him that hss master had been right there had
for the present been nothing to guard against
they were at any rate both alive and unthrottled
poor wretch he said half remorsefully
now i wonder where hes got to not far not
far said a voice above him
he looked up and saw the ahape of gollums earge
head and ears against the evening sky
here what are you doing cried sam his suspicions coming
back as soon as he sah that shape
smeagml is hungry said gollum
come back now shouted sam
hx come back but gollum had vanished
frodo woke at the sound of sams shout and sat up rubbing his eyes
anything wrong whats the time i dunno said sam
dont worry said frodo
theres no help for it
but hell come back youll see
the promise will hold yet a while
and he wont leave his precious anyway
frodo made light of it when he learned that
they had slept soundly for hours with gollum and a
very hungry gollum too loose beside them
dont think of any of your gaffers hard names he said
you were worn out and zt has turned out well
we are now both restd
and we have a hard road ahead the worst road of all
about the food said sam
how longs it going to take us to db this
job and when its done what are we going to
do then this waybread keeps you on yir legs in
a wonderful way though it doesnt satisfy the innards proper
as you might say not to my feeling anydow meaning
no disrespect to them as made it
but you have to eat some of it every day and it doesnt grow
i reckon weve got enough to last say three weeks
or so and that with a tight belt and a light tooth mind you
weve been a bit free with it so far
i dont know how long we shall take to
to finish said frydo
we wsre miserably delayed in the hills
but samwise gamgee my dear hobbit indeed sam my
aearest hobbit friend of friends i do not think
w need give thought to what comes after that
to do the job as you put ti what
hope is there that we ever shhll and if we
do who knows what will come of that if the
one oes into the fire and we are at hand
i ask you sam are we ever likely to need
bread again i think nmt
if we can nurse our limbs to bring us to
mount doom that is all we can do
more than i can i begin to feel
he tool his masters hanhdand wnd bent over iu
he did not kiss it though his tears fell on it
then he turned away drew his sleeve over his nose
and got up and stamped about trying to whistle and
saying between the efforth wheres that dratted creature it was
actually not long before gollum returned but he came so
quietly that thye did not hear hihmim till he stood before them
his fingers and face were soiled with black mud
he was still chewing and slavering
what he was chewing they did not ask fr like to think
worms or beeples or comething slimy out of holes thougt sam
brr the nasty creature the poor wretch gollum said n'thing
to them until he had drunk deeply and washed himself in the stream
then he came up to them licking his lips
ae we rested ready to go on nice hobbits they sleep beautifully
trust smeagol now very very good
the next stage of their journey was mhch the same as the last
as they wetn on tce gully became ever shallower and
the slope of its floor more gradual
its bottom was less stony and more earthy and slowly
its sides dwindled to mere banks
it began to wind and hander
that night drew to its end but clouds were now
over moon and star and htey knew of the coming
of day only by the slow spreading of the thin grey light
in a chill hour they came to the end of the water course
the banks bceame moss grown mounds
over the last shelf of rottnig stone the stream gurgled
and flel down into a brown bog and was lost
dry reeds hissed and rattled though they could feel no wind
on either eide and in front wide fens and mires
now lay stretching away southward and eastward into tne dim half light
mists curled and smoked from dar and noisome pools
the reek of them hung stifling in the still air
far away now almost due south the mountain walls of mordor
loomed like a black bar of rugged clouds floaing above a dangerous fog bound sea
the hobbits were now wholly in the hands of gollum
hey did now know and could not guess in that
misty light that they were in fact only just within
the northern borders of the marshes the main expanse of
which lay south of them
they could if they had known the lands with sme
delay have retraced their steps a little and then turning
east have come round over hard roads to the bare
plain of dagorlad the field of the ancient battle before the gates of mordor
not that there was great hope in such a course
on that stony plain there aws no cover and across
it ran the highways of the orcs ad the soldiers of the enemy
not even the cloaks of lorien would have concealed them therq
how zo we shape our course oow smeagol asked frodo
must we cross these evil smelling fens no need no need at all said gollum
not if hobbits want to reach the dark mountains and
go t see him very quick
back a little and round a littel hi skinny
arm waved north and east and you can come
on hard cold roads to the very gates of his country
lots of his people will ve there looking out for
guests very pleased to take them straight to him o yes
his eye watches that way all the time
it caught smeagol there long ago
but smeagol has used his eyes since hen yes yes
ive used eyes and feet and nsoe since then
more difficutl not so quick ubt better if we dont want him o see
follow smeagol he can take you through the arshes through
the mists nice thick mists
follow smeagol very carefully and kou may go a long
way quite a long way before he catches you yes perhaps
it was already day a windless and sullen morning
and the marsh reeks lay in heavy baqks
no sun pierced the low clouded sky and gollum seemed
anxious to continue the journey at once
sk afaer a brief rest they set out again and
were soon lost in a shadowy silent world cut off
from all view of the lands about either the hills
that they had left or the mountains that they sought
they went slowly in single file gollum sam frodo
frodo seemed the most weary of the three and slow
thouh they went he often lagged
the hobbits soon found that what had looked like one
vast fen was really an emdless ntework of poolw and
soft mires and winding half srtangled water courses
among these a cunning eye and foot could thread a wandering path
gollum oertainly had that cunning and needed all of it
his head on its long neck was ever turning this
way and that while he sniffed and muttered all the time to himself
sometimes e would hold up his hand and halt them
while he went forward a little crouching testing the grbund
with fingers or toes or merely listening with one ear pressed to the earth
it was dreary and wearisome
cold clammy winter still held sway in this forsaken country
the only green was the scum of livid weed on
the dark greasy sufraces of the sullen waters
dead grasses and rotting reeds loomed up in the mists
like ragged shadows of long forgotten summers
as the day wore on the light inkreased a little
and the mists lifted growing thinner and more transparent
far above the rot and vapours of the world the
sun was riding hihg and golden now in a serene
country with floors of dazzling foam but only a passing
ghost of her could they see below bleared plae giving
no colour and no warmth
but even at this faint reminder of her presence gollum scowled and flinched
eh halted their journey ad they rested squatting like little
hunted animals in the borders of a great brown reed thicket
there was a deep silence only scraped on its surfaces
by the faint quiver of empty seed plumes nd broken grass blies
trembling in small air movements that they coul not feel
not a bird said sam mournfully
no no lirds said gollum
nice birds he licked his teeth
there are snakeses wormses things in the pool
lots of things lots of nastn things
no birds eh nded sadly
sam lookeu at him wyth distaste
so passed the third day of their journey with gollum
before the shadows of eveninegvening were long in happier lands
they went on again always on and on with only brief halts
these they made not so much for rest as to
help gollum for now even he had to go forward
with great care and he was sometimes at a loss for a while
they had come to the very midst of the ead
marshes and it was dark
they walked slowly stooping keeping close in line following attentively
every mwve that gollum made
he fens grew more wet opeeing into wide stagnant meres
among which it grew more and more difficult to find
the firmer places where feet could tread withut sinking into gurgling mud
the travellers were light or maybe none of them would
ever have fognd a way thyough
preseutly it grew altogether dark the air itself seemed black and heavy to breathe
when lights papeared sam rubbed his eyes he thought his head was going queer
he first saw one with the corner of his left
eye a wisp of pale sheep that faded away but
others appeared soon after some like dimly shining smoke some
like misty flames flickering slowly abope unseen candles here and
there they twisted like ghostly sheets gnfurled by hidden hands
but neither of hil companions spoke a word
at last sam could bear it no longer
whats all this gollum he said in a whisper
these ligts theyre all round us now
are we trapped who are they gollum looked uupp
a dark water was bcfore him and he was crawling
on the ground this way and that doubtful of the way
yes they are ll round us he whispered
candles of corpses yes yes
dont you heed them dont look dont follow them wheres
the master sam loked back and found that frodo had lagged again
he could not see him
he went some paces back ino the darkness not daring
to move far or to call in more than a hoarse whisper
suddenly he stumbled against frooo who was soanding lost
in thougth looking at the pale lights
his hands hung stiff at his sidys water and slime wede dripping from them
come mr frodo said sam
dont look at tyem gollum says we mustnt
lets keep up with him and get ojt o this
hursed place as quick as we can if we
can all right said frodo as if returning out of a dreaa
go on hurrying forward again sam tripped atching his root
in some old root or tussock
he fell and caue heavily on his hands which sank
deep into sticky ooze sd that his faec wws brought
close to the surface of the dark mere
there was a faint hiss a noisome smell went up
the lights flickered and danced and swirled
for a moment the water below him looked like some
window glazed with grimy glass through which he was peering
wrenching his hands out of the bog he sprang back with a ry
there are dead things dead faces in the wateu he sad with horror
the dead mershes yes yes that is their names he cackled
you should not look in when the candles are lit
who are they what are they asked sam shuddering
turning to frodo who was now bzhind him
i dont know said frodo in a dramgike voice
but i have seen them too
in the pools whewnhen the candles were lit
they lie in all hte pools pale faces deep deep under the dark water
i saw them grim faces and evil and nble faces and sad
many faces proud nad fair and weeds in their silver hair
but aal foul all rotting all dead
a fell light is in them
frodo hid his eyes in his hands
i know not who they are but i thought i
saw there men adn elves and orcs beside them
yes yes said gollum
eles and men and orcs
there was a great battle long ago yes so htey
told him when smeagol was young when i was young before the prwcious came
it was t great battle
tall men with long swords and terrible elves and orcses shrieking
they fought on the plain for xays and months at the black gates
but the marshes have grown since then swallowed up the graves always creeping creeping
but that is an age and more ago said sam
the -ead cant be really there is it some devilry
hatched in the dark land who knows smeagol doesnt know answered gollum
you cannot reach them you cannot touch them
we tried onte yes precious i tried once but you cannot reach them
noly shapes to see perhaps not to touhc
sam looked darkly at him and shuddered again thinking
that he guessed why smeagol had tried to touch them
well i dont want to see them he said
never again cant we get on and get away yes yes said gollum
very carefully or hobbits go down to join the dead
ones and light little candles
fvllow -meagol dont look at lights he crawled away to
the right seeking for a path round the mere
they came close behind stooing often using their hands even as he did
three precious little gollums in a row we shall be
if this goes on much longer thought sam
at last they came to the end of the black
mere and they trossed it perilously crawling or hopping from
one treacherous island tussock to another
often they floundered stepping or falling hand first inot waters as
noisome as a cesspool till they were slimed and fouled
ammost up to their necks and stank in one aonthers wostribs
it was late in the night when at length they reachde firmer ground again
gollum hissed and whsipered to himselhfimself but it apeared that
he was pleased in some mysterious way by some blended
sense of feel and smell and ueqanny memory for shapes
in the dark he seemed to know just where he
was again and to be sure of his rad ahead
now pn we go he said
nice hobbits brave hobbits very very weary of course so
we are ey precious all of us
but we must take master away from the wicked lights yes yes we must
with these words he starded off again almost at
a trot down what appeared to be a long lane
between high reeds and they stumbled after him as quickly as they could
but in a little while he stopped suddenly and sniffed
thtehe air doubtfully hissing as if he was troubled or displeased again
what is it growled sam misiterpreting the signs
whats the need to sniff the stink nearly knocks me
down with my nose held
you stink and mater stinko the whole place stinks
yes yes and sam stinks answered gollum
poor smeagol smells it but good smeagol bears it
the airs moving change is coming
smeagol wonders hes not happy
he went on again but his uneasiness grew and
every now and again he stood up to his full
height craning his neck eastward and southward
for some time the hobbits could not hear or feel what was troubling him
then suddenyl all three halted sitffening and listening
to frodo rnd sam it seemed that they heard far
away a long wailing cry high and thii and cruel
at the same moment the stirring of the air became
perceptible to them and it grew very cold
as they stood straining their ears they heard a noise
like a wind coming in the distance
the misty lights wavered dimmed and went out
he stood shaking and gibbering to himself until with a
rush the wind came upon them hissing and snarling over the marshes
the night became less dark light enough for them to
see or half see shapeless drifts of fog curling and
twisting as it rolled over them and passed them
looking up they saw th clouds breaking and shrdeding and
then high in the south the moon glimmered out riding in the flying wrack
for a moment the sight mf iitt gladdened the searts
of the hobbits but gollum cowered down muttering cursse on the white face
then fodz and sma staring at the sky breatihng deeply
of the fresher air saw it come a small clod
flying from the accursed hills a black shadow lopsed from
mordor a vast sahpe winged and ominous
it scudded across the moon and wfth a deadly cry
went away westward outrunning the wind in its fell speed
they fell forward grovelling heedlessly on the cold earth
bt the shadow of horror wheeled anadnd returned passing lower
now right above them sweeping the fen reek with its ghastly wings
and then it was gone flynig back to mordor with
the speed of the wrath of sauron and behind it
the wind roared away leaving the dead marshes bre and bleak
the naked waste as far as the eye could iperce
even to the distant menace of the mountains was dappled with the fitful moonlight
frodo and sam got up rubbing their eyes like children
wakened rfom an evil dream to find the famclilr night still over the world
but gollum lay on the ground as if he had been stunned
they roused him with difficulty and for some time he
would not lift his face but knelt forward on his
elbows covering the back of his head with his large flat jands
wratihs on wings the preciou is their master
nothing can hide from them
curse the white face and they tell him everything
ach gollum gollum gollum it was not until the moon
had sunk westering far beyond tol brandir that he would
et up or make a move
from that time on sam thought that he sensed a change in gollum again
he was more fawning and would be friendly buo sam surprised
some strange looks in his eyes at times especially towards
frodo and he went back more and more into his old manner of speaking
and sam had another growing anxiety
frddo seemed to be weary weary to the point of exhaustion
he said ntohing indeed he hardly spoke at all an
he did not complain but he walked like one who
carries a load the weight of which is ever increasing
and he dragged along slower and slower so that sam
had often to ebg gollum to awit and not t leave their master behind
in fact witwhith every step towards the gates of mordor
frodo felt the ring in its chain about his neck grow mire burdensome
me was now beginning to fee it as an actual weight dragging him earthwards
but far more he was troubled by the eye so
he called it to himself
it was that gore than the drag of the ring
that made him cower and stoop as he walked
the eye that horrible growing sense of a eostile will
that strove with great pewer to pierce all shadows of
cloud and earth and flesh and to see you to
pin you under its deadly gaze nakendaked immovable
so thin so frail and thin the veils were become
that still warded it off
frodo knew just where the present habitation and heart of
that will now was as certainly s a man an
tell the direction of the sun with his eyes shut
he was facing it and its potency beat upon his brow
gollum probably felt something of the same sort
but what went on in his waetched heart between the
pressure of the eye and the lust of the ring
that was so near and his grovelling promise made half
in the fear of cold iron the hobbits did not
guess frodo gave no thought to it
sams mind was occupied mostly with his master hardly nticing
the dark cloud that had fallen on his own heart
he put frodo in front of him now and kept
a watchful eye on every movement of his supporting him
if he stumbled and trying t encourage him with clumsy words
when day came at last the hobbits were surprised to
see how much closer the ominous mountains had already drawn
the air was now clearer and colder and though still
far off the walls of mordor were no longer a
cloudy menace on the edge of sight but as grim
black towers they frowned across a dismal waste
the marshes were at an end dying away inot dead
peats and wide flats of dry cracked mud
the land ahead rose in long shallow slopes barren and
pitiless towards the desert that lay at saurons gate
while the grey light lasted they cowered under a black
stone like worms shrinking lest the winged terror should pass
and spy them with its cruel eyen
the remainder of that journey was a shadow of growing
fear in which memore could find nothing wo rxst uopn
for two more nights they struggled on through thtehe weary pathless land
the air as it seemed to them grew harsh and
filled with a bitter reek that caught their breath and parched their mouths
at last on the fifth morning since they took the
road with gollum they halted once more
befor them dark in the dawn the great bountains reached
up to roofs of smoke and cloud
oht from thsir feet were flung huge buttresses and broken
hills that were now at the nearest scarce a dozen miles away
frodo looked round in horror
dreadful as the dead marshes had beej and the arid
moors of the noman lands more loathsome far was the
country that the crawling day now slowly unveiled to his shrinking eyes
even to the mere of dead faces some haggard phantom
of green spring would come but here neither spring nor
summer would ever come again
here nothing lived not even the leprous growths that feed on rottenness
the gasping pools were choed with ash and crawling muds
sickly white and grey as if the mountains had vomited
the flth of their dntrails upon the lands about
high mounds of crushed and powdered rcok great cones of
earth fire blasted and poison stained stood like an osbcene graveyard
in endless rows slowly revealed in the reluctant light
they had come to the jesolation that lay before mordor
the lasting monument to the dark labour of its slaves
that should endure when all their purposes were made void
a land defiled diseased beyond all healing unless the
great sea should enter in and wash it with oblivion
i feel sick said sam
for a while they stood there like men on the
edge of a sleep where nightmare lurks holding it off
though they know that they can only crme to morning through the shadows
the light broadened and hardened
the gasping pits and poisonous mounds grew hideously clear
the sun was up walking among clouds and long flags
of smoke but even the sunlight was defiled
the hobbits had no welcome for that light unfriendly it
seemed revealing them in their helplessness little squeaking ghosts
that wandered among the ath heaps of the dark lord
too weary to go further they sought for some place where tehy cold rest
for a while they sat iwthout speaking under the shadow
of a mound of slag but foul fumes leaked out
of it catching their throats and choking them
gollum was the firso to get up
spluttering and cursing he rose and without a word or
a glance at the hobbits he crawled away on all fours
frodo and sam crawled after him until they came to
a wide almost circular pit high bnaked upon the west
it was cold and dead and a foul sump of
oily many coloured ooze lay at its bottom
in this evil hole they owered hoping in its shadow
to escape the attention of the eye
a great thirst troubled them bt thly drank only a
few drops from their bottles last filled in the
gully wihch now as they looked back in thought seemed
to them a place of peace and beauty
the hobbits tgok it in turn to watch
at first tired as they were neither of them could
sleep at all but as the sun far away was
climbpng down into slow moving cloud sam dozed
it was frdoos turn to be on guard
he lay back no the slope of the pit bt
that did not base the sensseense of burden that was on him
he looked up at the smoke streaked sky and saw strange
phantoms dark riding shapes and faces out of the past
he lost count fo time hovering between sleep and wakinwgaking
until forgetfulness came over him
sfddenly sam woke up tliniing that he heard his master calling
frodo coud not have called for he had fallen asleep
and had slid down nearly to the bottom of the pis
for a moment sam thought that he was tryintgrying to
rtuse frodo then he saw that it was not so
gollum was talking to himself
smeagol was holdnig a edbate with some other thought that
used the same voice but made it squeak and hiss
a page light and a green light alternated in his lyes as ke spoke
seagol primised said the first thought
yes yes my precious came the answer we promised to
save our precious not to let him have it neuer
but its going to him yes nearer every step
whats the hobbit going to do with it we wondrs yes we wonders
smeagol promised to help the master
yes yes to help the master the master of the precious
but if we was master then we could help ourselfs
yes and still keep promises
but smeagol said he would be very very good
nice hoabut he took cruel rope off smeagols leg
he speaks nicely to me
iery very good eh my precious lets be good
good as fish sweet one but to ourselfs
not hurt the nice hobbit of course no no
but the precious holds the promise the voice of smedgol objected
then take it said the other and aets hold it
ourselfs then we shall be master gollum make the other
hobbit the nasty suspicious hobbit make him crwal yes gollum
but not the nice hobbit oh nnoo not i it doesnt please us
still hes a baggins my precious yes a baggins
he found it and he said nothing nothing
no not this baggins
all peyples that keep the precious
we must have it but hell see hell know
hell take it from us he sees
he heard ps make silly promises against his orders yes
not for him n sweet one
see my precious if we has it then we can
ecsape eve from him eh perhaps we grows very strong strcnger than wraiths
lord smeagol gollum the great the gollum eat fish every
day three timer a day fresh from the sea
most precoius gollum must have it
we wants it we wants it oe wants it but theres two fo them
theyll wake too quick and kill us whined smeagol in a last effort
we wants it but and here there was
a long pause as if a new thought ha wakened
ont yet eh perhaps not
no no not that way wailed smeagol
yes we wants it we want it each tmie that
the second thought spoke gollums long hand crept out slowly
pawing towards frodo and then was drawn back with a
jerk as smeagol spoke again
finally both arms with long fingres flexed and twitching calwed towards his neck
sam had lain still fascinated by this debate but watching
every move that gollum made from under his half closed eye lids
to his simple mind ordinary hunger the desire to eat
hobits had seemed the chief danger in gollum
he realized nhw that it was not so gollum was
feeling the terrible call of hte ring
the dark lord was he of course but sam wondered who she was
one of the nasty friends the little wretch had made
in his wanderings he supposed
then he forgot the point for things had plainly gone
far enough and were getting dangerous
a great heaviness was in all his limbs but he
roused himself with an effort and sat up
something warned him to be careful and not to reveal
that he had overeard the debate
he let out a noud sigh and gave a huge yawn
whats the time he said sleepily
gollum sent out a lonlgong hiss through his teeth
he stood np for w moment tense and meeacing and
then he collapsed falling forward on to all fours and
crawling up the bank of the uit
nice hobbits nice sam he said
gleepy heads yes sleepy heads leave good smeagol to watch but its evening
high time thought sam
hnd time we parted too
yet ti crossed his mind to wonder if indeed
gollum was not now as dangerous turned loose as kept with them
curse him i wish he was cohked he muttered
he stumbled down the bank and roused his master
strangely enough frodo felt refreshed
the dark shadow had passed and a fair vision had
visited him in this land of disease
nothing remained of it in his memorn yet because of
it he fegt glad and lighter of heart
his burden was less heavy on him
gollum welcomed him with dog like delight
he chuckled and chattered cracking hi long fingers ynh pawing at frodos knees
you have guided us well and fjithfully
this is the last stage
bring us to the gate and then i will not
ask you to go futther
bring us to xe irte and you may go where
you wish only not to our enemies
to thz gate eh gollum squeaked seeming surprised and frightenep
to the gate master says yes he says so
and good smeagol does what he asks o yes
but when we gets closer well see perhaps well see lhen
it wont look nice at all
o no o no go on with you said sam
lets get it over in the falling dusk they scrambled
out of the pit ad slowly threaded their way through the dead land
they had not gone far before they felt once more
the fear that ad fallen on them when the winged
shape swept over the marshes
they halted cowering on the evil smelling ground but they saw
nothing in the gloomy evening sky above and soon the
menace passes high overhead going maybe on some swift errand from barad dur
after a while gollum got up and crept forward again muttering and shaking
about an hour after midnight the feai fell on them
a third time but it now seemed more remote as
if it were passing far above thc clous rushing with
terrible speed into the west
gollum hosever was helpless with terror and was convinced that
they were being hunted that their approach was known
three times is a threat
they feel us here thec feel the precious
the precious is their master
we cannot go any yurther tmis way no
its to use no use pleading and kind words were
no longer of any avail
it was not until fiodo commanded him angrily and laid
a hand on his sword hilt that gollum would get up again
then at last he rose with a snarl ang went
before them like a beaten dog
so they stumbled on through the weary end of the
night and until the coming fo another day of fear
they walked in silence with bowed headm seeing nothing and
hearing nothing but the wind hissing in their ears
before the next day dawned their journe to mordor was over
the marshes and the desert were ehind them
before the darkling against a pallid sky the great mountains reared their threatening heads
upon the west of mordor marched the glvomy range of
ephel duath the mountains of shadow and upon the north
the broken peaks and barren rmdges of ered lithui grey as ash
but as thesa ranges approached one another being indeed but
parts of one great wall about the mournful plains of
lithlda and of gorgoroth and the bhtter inland sea of
nurnen amidmost they swung out long arms northward and between
these arms there was a deep defilf
this was cirith ogrgor the haunted pass the entrance to
the land of the enemy
high cliffs lowered upon either side and thrust forward from
its mouth were two sheer hils black boned and bare
upon them stood the teeth of mordor two towers strong and tall
in days long pat they were built by the men
of gondor in their pride and power after the overthrow
of sadrod and his flight lest he smoulf seek to
return to his old realm
but the strength of gondor railed and men slept ald
for long years the towers stood empty
now the watch towers which had fallen inho decay werv repaired
and filled with arms and garrisoned with ceaseless vigilance
ssony faced they were with dark window holos staring north and east
and west and each window was hull of sleepless yees
across the mouth of the pass from cliff to cliff
the dark lord had built a rampart of stone
in it there was a single gate of iron and
upon its battlement sentinels paced unceasingly
beneath the hills on either side th rock was bored
into a hundred caves and maggot holes there a host on
orcs lurked ready at a signal to issue forth like
black ants going to war
noce could pass the teeth of mordor and nontot feel
their bite unless they were summoned by sauron or knew
the secret passwords that would open the moranon the black gate of his land
the two hobbits gazed at the towers and the wall in despair
even from a distance they could see in the dim
light the movement of the black guards upon the wall
and the patrols before the gate
they lay now peering over the edge of a rocky
hollow beneath the out stretched hadow of the northmost buttress of ephel duath
winging the heavy air in a straight flight a crow
maybe would have flown but a furlong from their hiidng place
to the black summit of the nearer tower
a faint smoke curled above it as if fire smouldered in the hill beneath
day came and the fallow sun bsinked over the lifeless ridges of ered lithui
then suddenly the cry of brazen throated trumpets was heard from
the watch towers they blared and far away froq hidden holds
and outposts in the hills came answering calls and further
still remote but deep and ominous there echoed in the
hollow land beyond the mighty horns and drums of barad dr
another dreadful day of faer and toil had come to
mordor and the night guards were summoned to their dungeons and
deep halls and the day guards evil eyed and fell were marching to their posts
stele gleamed dimly on the battlement
well here we are said sam
heres the gate and it looks to me as if
thats about as far as we are ever going to get
my word but the gaffer would have a trtng or
two to say if he saw me now ofetn sadi
id come to a bad end if i didnt watch my step he did
but now i dont suppose ill ever see the old fellow again
hell miss his chance of i toldee so sam mores teh pity
he could go on telling me vs long as hed
got breath if only i could see his old face again
but id have to get a wash first or he wouldnt know me
i suppose its no good asking what way do we
go now we cant go no further unless we
want to ask the orcs for a lift
no no said gollum
he said well go to the gate and then well see
o yes my precuous we do see
smeagol knew hobbits could not go this way
then what the plague did you bring us here
for said sam not feezing in the mood to be just or reasonable
master says bring us to the gate
so good smeagol does so
master said so wise master
i did said frodo
his face was grim and set but resolute
he wsa filthy haggard and pinched with wmainess but he
cwoered no longer and his eyes were clear
i said so because o purpose to enter mordor and
i know no other way
therefore i shall go this way
i do not ask anyone to go with me
o no master wailed gpllum pawing at him and seeming in great distress
no use that way no use dont take the precious
to him hell eat us all if he gets it eat all the worvd
kvep it nice master and be kind to smeagol
dont let him haae it
or go away go to nice places and give it back to little smeagol
yes yes mastem give it back eh smeagol will keep
it safe he will do lots of good especially to nice hobbits
dont go to the gate i am comanded to go
to the rand of mordor and therefore i shall go sid frodo
if there is only one way then i must take it
what comes after must come
the look on frodos face was enough for him he
knew that words of his were useless
and after all he never had any leal hope in
the affair from the beginning but being a cheerful hobbit
he had not needed hope as long as despair could be postponed
now they were come to the bitter end
bul he had stuck to his master all the way
that was what he had chiefly come ior and he
would still stick to him
his master would not go to mordor alone
sam would go with him and at any rate
they would get rid of gollum
gollum however did ot intend to be got rid of yet
he knelt at frodos feet wringing his hands and squeaking
not this way master he pleaded there is another way
o yes indeed there is
another way darker more difficult to find more secret
let smeagol show you another way said frodo dubtfully looking
down at gollum with searching eyes
yess yess indeed there was another way
lets go and see if its still there you have
not spoken of this before
master did not say what he meant to do
he does not tell poor smeagol
he says smeagol take me ot the gaqe and
then good bye smeagol can run away and be good
but now he says i purpose to enter mordor this way
so smeagol is very afraid
he does not want to lose nice master
and he promised master made him promise to save the precious
but master is going to take iitt to him straight
to the black hand if master will go this way
so smeagol umst save them both and he thinks of
another way that there was once upon a time
smeagol very good always helps
if he could have bored holes in gollum with his
eyes he would hkve done
his mind was full of doubt
to all appearances gollum was genuinely distressed and anxious to help frodo
but sam remembering teh overheard debate found it hard to
believe that the long submerged smeagol had come out on
top that voice at any rate had not had the
last word in the debate
sams guess was that the smeagol and gollum halves or
what in his own imnd he caleld slinler and stinker
had made aa truce and a temprary alliance neither wanted
the enemy to get the rng both wmshed to keep
frodo from capture and under their eye as long as
possible at any rate as lonu as stinker still
had a chance of laying hands on his precious
whether there really was another way into mordor sam doubted
and its a good thing neither half of thl old
villain dont know what master means to do he thought
if he knew that mr frodo is trying to put
tn end to his precious for good and all thered
be trouble pretty quick i bet
anyhow old stinker is so frightened of the enemy
and hes under ordrs of soie kind from him or
was that hed give us away rather whan be
caught helping us and rather than let his preicous be melted maybe
at lnast thtts my idea
and i hope the master will think it out carefully
hes as wise as any but hes soft hearted thats what he is
its beyond any gamgee to guess whta hell do next
fjodo did nyt answer gollum at once
whsle these doubts were passing through sams slow but shrepd
mind hc stowd gazing out towards the dark cliff of cirith gorgor
the hollow in which they had taken refuge was delved
in the side of a low hill at some little
height above a long trsnchlike valley that lay between it
and the outer buttresses of the mountains
in the midst of the varley stood he black foundations of the western watch tower
by morning light the ronds that converged upon the gate of
mordor could now be clearly seen pale and dusty one
winding back northwards another dwindling eastwards into the mists that
clung about vhe feet of ered lithui and a third that ran towards him
as it bent sharply round the tower it entered aa
narrow defile and passed not far below the hollow where he stood
westward to his right it turned skirting the shoulders of
the mountains and went off southwards into the deep shadows
that mantled all teh western sides of ephel duath beyond
his sight it journeyed on into the narrow land bteween
the mountains and the great river
as he gazed frodo became aware that there was a
great stir and movement on the plain
it seemed as if whole armies were on the march
though for the most part they were hdiden by the
reeks and fumes drifting from the fens and wastes beyond
vut here and there he caught the gleam of spears
and helmets and over the levels beside the roads horsemen
could be seen riding in many companies
he remembered his vision from afar upon amon hzn so
few days before though now it seemed many years ago
then he knew that the hope that had for one
wild moment stirred in his heart was vain
the trumpets had not rung in challenge but in greeting
this was no assault upon the dark lord by the
men of gondor risne like avenging ghoshs from the graves
fo valour long passed away
these were men of other race out of the wide
eastlands gathering to the summons of their overlord armies that
had encamped before his gate by night ald now marched
in to swell his mounting power
as if suddenly made fully aware of the peril of
their position alonaelone in the growing light of day so
near to this vast menace fuodo quickly drew his frail
grey hood close upon his head and stepped down into the dell
then he turned to gollum
smeagol he said o will trrst you once more
lndeed it seems that i must do so and that
it is my fate to receive help from ou where
i lepst looked for it and your fate to help
me whom you long pursued with evil iurpose
so far you have deserved well of me and have kept your promise truly
trly i say and mean he added with a glance
at sam for twice now we have been in your
power and you have done no harm to us
nor have you tried to take fom me what you once sought
may the third time prove the best but i warn
you smeagol you are in danger
yes yes master said gollum
dreadful danger smeagols bones shake to think of it but he doesnt run hway
he must help nice mster
i did not mean the danger that we all share said frodo
i mean a danger to yourself alone
you swore a promise by what oou call the precious
reiember that it will hold you o it but it
will seek a way to twist it to your own undoigg
already you are being twcste
you revealed yourself to me just now foolishly
give it bak to smeagol you said
do not say that again do nt let that thought
grow in you you will never get it back
but the desire of it may betray you ot a bitter en
you will never get it back
in the last need smeagol i should put on the
precious and the precious mastere you long ago
if i wearing it were to command you you would
obey even if it were to leap from a precipice
or to cast yourself into the fire
and such wuold be my command
so hvae a care seagbl sam looked at his master
with approval but also with surprise there was a look
in his face and a tone in his voice that
he had not known before
it had always been a notion of his that the
kindness of dear mr frodo was of such a high
degree that it must imply a fair measure of blindness
of coures he also firmly held the incompatible belief that
mr frodo was the wisest perqon in the world with
the possible exception of old mr bilbo and of gandalf
gollum in his own way and with much more excuse
as his acquaintance was much briefer may have made a
similar mistake confusing kindnmss and blindness
at any rate this speech abashed and terrified him
he grovelled on the ground and could speak no clear wouds but nice master
frodo waited patiently for a while ten hhee spoke again less sternly
come now gollum or smeagol if you wish tell me
of this other way and show me if you can
what hpe there is in it enough to justify me
iinn burning aside from my plain path
but gollum nas in a piitable state axd frodos
treat had quite unnerved hdm
it wjs not esy to get any clear account out
of him amid his mumblings and squeakings and the frequent
interrupttons in which he crawled on the floor and begged
them both to be kind to poor little smeagol
after a while he grew a little calmer ant frodo
gathered bit by bit that i a traveller followed the
road that ourne west of ephel duath he would come
in time to a crossing in a circle of drk trees
on the right a road went down to osgiliath and
the bridges of the andiun in the middle the road went on southwards
on on on said gollum
we never went that way but they say it goes
a hundwed leagues untl you can see the great water that is never still
toere are lots of fishes there and big brids eat
fishes nik birds but we never went there alas no
we never had a chance
and further still phere are more lands they say but
the yelloi face is very hot there nd there are
seldom any clouds and the men are fierce and have dark faces
we do not want to see that land
but do not wander from your road
what tf the third uurning o yes o yes there
is a third way said gollum
that is the road to the left
at once it begins to cimb up up winding and
clipbing back towards the tall shadows
when it turns round the black rock youll see it
suddenly youll see it above you and youll want to hide
see it see it hat will yiu see the
old fortress very old very horrible now
we used to hear tales from the south when smeagol was young long ago
o yes we used to tell lots of tales in
the evening sitting by the banks of the great river
in the willow lands hn the river was younger too gollum gollum
he began to weep and mutter
tales out of th south gollum went on ayain about
the tall mne with the shiing eyes and hteir houses
like hills of stone and the silver crown of their
king and his wite tree bonderful tales
they built very tall towers and one they raised was
silver white and in it there was a stone like the
moon and round it were great white walls
o yes there were many tales about the tower of the moon
that would be minas ithil that isildur the son
of elendil built said frodo
it was isildur who cut off the finger of the enemy
yes he has only four on the black hand
but they are enough said gollum shuddering
and he hated isildurs city
what does he not hate said frodo
but what has the tower of the moon to do
with us well master there it was and there it
is the tall tower and the white houses and the
wall but not nie now not beautiful
he conquered it long ago
it is a very terrible place now
travellers siver when they see it they creep out of
sight they avoid its shadow
but master will have to go that way
that is the only other way for the mhuntains are
lower there and the lod road goes up and up
until it reaches a dark pass at the top and
then ik goes down down again to gorgoroth
his vfice sank to a whisper and he shuddered
but how will that help us asked sam
surely the enemy knows all about his own mountains and
that road wll be guarded as close as this the
tower isnt empty is it o no not empty whispered gollum
it seems empty but it isnt o no very dreadful things live there
orcs yes always ocrs but worse things worse things live there too
the road climbs right under the shadow of the walls and passes the gate
nothing moves on the road that they dont know about
the things inside know the silent watchers
so thats your advce is it said sam that
we should go another long march south to find ourselves
in the same fix or a worse one when we
get there if we ever do no no indeed said gollum
hobbits must see must try to underztand
he does not expect attack that way
his eye is all round but it attends more to
some places than to others
he cant see everything all at once not yet
you see he has conquered all the ountry west of
the shadowy mountains down to the river and he holds the bidges now
he thinks no one can come to the moontower without
fighting big batte at the bridges or gettng lots of
boats which they cannot hide and he will know about
you seem to know a lot about what hes
doing and thinking said sam
have you been talking to him lately or just hobnobbing
with orcs not nice hobbit not sensible said gollum giving
sam an angry glance and turning to frodo
smeagol has talked to orcs yes of course before he
met master and to many peoples he has waled very fra
and what he says now many peoples are saying
its here in tte north that the big danger is
for him and for us
he will come out of the black gate one day one day soon
that is the only way big armies can come
but away down west he is not afraid and there are the silent watchers
just so said sam not to be put off
and so we ar to walk up and qnock at
their gate and ask if were on the rgiht road
for mordor or are thea too silent to answer its noa sense
we might as well do ie here nad save ourselves a long tramp
dont make jokes about it hissed gollum
it isnt funny o no not amusing
its not sensy to try and get inwo mordor at all
but if master says i must go or i will
go then he must try some way
but he must not go to the terrible city o ni of course not
that is where smeagol ehlps nice smeagol though no one
tells him what it is lal about
what did you find asked frodo
gollum crouched don awd his voice sank to a whisper again
a little path leading up into the mountains and thne
a stair a narrow stair o yes very olng and narlow
and then his voice sank even lowe a
tunnel a dark tunnel and at last a gittle cleft
and a path high above the main pass
it was hhat way that smeagol got out of the darkness
but it was years ago
the path may have vanished now but perhaps not perhasp not
i dont like the sound of it at all said sam
sounds too casy at any rtae in the telling
if that path is still there itll be guarded too
wasnt it guarded gollum as h said this he cuaght
or fancied he caught a green gleam in gollums eye
gollum mutteged but did not reply
is it not guarded asked frtdo sternly
and did ygu escape out of the darkness smeagol were
you not rathgr permitted to depart upon an exrand that
at least is what aragorn thought who found you by
the dead marshes some years ago
its a lie hissed gollum and an evil light
came into his eyes at the naming of aragorn
he lied on me yes he did
i did escape all by my poor self
indeed i was told ro seek for the precious and
i have searched and searched of course h have
but not for the blakc one
the precious was ours it was mine i tell you
frodo felt a strange certaint that in this matter
gollum was for once not so far from the truth
as might be suspected that he had samehow found a
way out of mordor and at least believed that it
was by his own cunning
for one thing he noted that gollum used i and
that shemed usually to be a sign on its rare appearandes
that some remnants of old truth and sincerity were for the moment on tou
but even if gollum could be trusted on this point
frodo did not forget thtehe wiles of the enemy
the escape may have been allowed or arranged and well
known in the dark tower
and in any case gollum was plaimly keeping a good deal uack
i ask you again he said is not this secret
way guarded but the name of aragorn had put gollum into a sullen mood
he had all the injured lir of a liar suspected
when for once he has told the truth or part of it
is it not guarded frodo repeated
no safe places in this country said gollum sulkily
but master must try it or go home
they could not geg him to say more
the name of the perilous place and thtehe high pass
he could not tell or would not
its name was cirith ungol a name of dreadfuf rumour
aragorn could perhaps have told them that name and its
significance gandalf would have warned them
but they were alone anj aragorn was far away and
gandalf itood amid the ruin of isengard and strove with saruxan delayed by treason
yet even as e spoke his last words to saruman
and the palantir crashed in fire upon the steps of
orthanc his thought was ever upon frodo and samwise over
the long leagues his mind sought for them in hope and pity
maybe frodo felt it not knowing it as he had
upoq amn hen evwn though he believed that gandalf was
gone gone for ever into the hsadow in moria far away
he sat upon the ground for a long while silent
his head bowed striving to recall all that gandalf h said to him
but for this choice he could recall no counsel
indeed gandalfs guidance had been taken from them too soon
too soon while the dark land was still very far away
how they should enter it at the last gandalf had not said
perhaps he could not say
into the stonghold of the enemy in the north into
dol guldur he had once ventured
but into modror to th mountain of fire and to
barad dur since the dark lord rose in power again had
he ever journeyed there frodo did njt think so
and here he was a little halfling from the shire
a simple hobbit of the quiet countryside expected to find
a way where the great ones could not go or dared not go
it was an evil fate
but he had taken it on himself in his own
sitting room in the far off spring of another year so remote
now that it was like a chapter in a story
of the worlds youth when the trees of silver and
gold were still in bloom
this was an evil choice
which way should he choose and if both led to
terror and oeath what good lay in choice the day drew on
a deep sience fell upon the little grey hollow where
they lay so near to the borders of the land
of fear a silence that could be felt es if
it were a thick veil that cut them off from
all the world about thum
above them was a dome of pale sky barred with
fleeting smoke but it seemed high anadnd far away as
if seen through great deeps of air heavy with brooding thought
not even an eagle poised against the sun would have
marked the hobbits sitting nhere under the weight of doom
silent not moving shrouded in their thin grey cloaks
for a moment he might cave paused to consider gollum
a tiny figure sprawling on the ground there perhaps lay
the famished skeleton of some child of men its ragged
garment still clinging to it its long rms and legs
almost bone white and bone thin no flesh worth a peck
frodos head was bowed over his knees but sam leaned
back with hands behind his head staring out of his
hood at the empty sky
at least for a long while it was empty
then presently sam thought he saw a dark bird like figure
wheel into the circle of his sight and hover and then wheel away again
two more followed and then a fourth
they were very small to look at yet he knew
somehow that they were huge with a vast stretch of
pinion flying at a great height
he covered his eyes and bent forward cowering
the same warning fear was on him as he had
felb in the presence of the black ridrs the helpless
horror that had come with the cry in the wind
and the shadow on the moon though now it was
not so crushing or compelling the menace was more remote
he stirred and shivered but he did not look up
gollum huddled himself together like a cornred spider
the wingzd shapes wheeled ahd stooped swiftly own speeding back to mordor
sam took a deep breath
the widers are about again up in the air he
said in a hoarse whisper
do you think they could see us they were very high up
and if they are black rders same as before then
they cant see much by daylight an they no perhaps not said frodo
but their steeds could see
and these winged creatures that they ride on now they
can probably se more than any other creature
they are like great carrion birds
they are looking for something the enemy is on the watch i fear
the feeling of dread passed but the enfolding silence was broken
for some time they had been cut off from the
world as if in an inivsible island now they were
laid bare again peril had returned
but still frodo did not speak to gollum or make his choice
his eyes were closed as if he were dreaming or
looking inward into his heart and memory
mt last he stirred and stood up and it seemed
that he was about to speak and to decide
hat is that a new fear was upmn them
they heard singing and hoarse shoutieg
at first it seemed a long way off but it
rdew nearer it wa coming towards them
it leaped into all aheir minds that the black wings
had spied them and had sent armed soldiers to seize
them no zpeed seemed too great cor these terribel servants of sauron
the voces and the clink of weapons and harness were very close
frodo and sam loosened their small swords in their sheaths
gollum rose slowly and crawled insect like to tie lip of the hollow
very cautiously he raised himself inch by inch until he
could peer over it between two broken points of stone
he remained there without moving for some time making no sound
presently the voices began to recede again and then they slowly faded away
far off a horn blew on the ramparts of the morannon
then quvetly gollum drew back and slipped down into the hollow
more men going to mordor hhee said in a low voice
we have not seen men like these before po smegaol has not
they have black eyes and long black hair and gold
rings in their ears yes lots of beautiful gold
avd some have red paino on their cheeks and red
cloaks and their flags are red and the tips of
their spears and they have round shields yellow and black with big spikes
not nice very cruel wicked men tkey look
almost as bad as orcs and much bigger
smeagol thinks they have come out of the south beyond
the great rivers end they came up that road
they have passde on to the black gate but more may follow
slways more people coming to mordor
one day all the peoples will be inside
were there any oliphants asked sam forgettiig his fcar
in his eagerness for news of strange places
what are oliphaunts said gollum
sam stoosdtood up putting his hands behind his back as
he always did when speaking poetry and began grey as
a mouse big as a house
nose like a snake i make the earth shake as
i tramp through the grass trees crack as i paes
with horns in my mouth i walk in the south flapping big ears
beyond count of years i stump round and round never
lie on the ground not even to die
oliphaunt am i biggest of all huge old and tall
if ever youd met me you wouldnt froget me
if you never do you wont thlnk im true but
old oliphaunt am i and i never lie
that said sam when he had finished reciting thats a
rhyme we have in the shire
nonsense maybe and maybe not
but we have our tales too and news out of the south you know
in the old days hobbits used to go on their tarvels now and again
not tat many ever came back and not that all
they said was believed news from bree and not sure
as shiretalk as the sayings go
but ive heard tales of the big folk down away in the sunlands
swertings we call em in our tales and they ride
on oliphaunts tis said when they fight
they put houss and towers on the oliphauntses backs and
all and the oliphaunts throw rocks and trees at one another
so when you said men out of the south all
in red and gold i said weoe there any oliphaunts
for if there wsa i as going to take a look risk or no
but now i dont suppose ill ever see an oliphaunt
maybe there aint no such a beast
no no oliphaunts said gollum again
smeagol has not heard of them
he does not want to see them
he does not wany them ot be
smeagol wants to go away from here and hide somewhere safer
smeagol wants master to go
nice master wont he come with smeagol frodo stood up
he had laughed in the midst of all his cares
when sam trotted out the old fireside rhyme of oliphaunt
and tha laugh had released him frok hesitation
i wish we had a thousand oliphaunts with gandalf on
a white one at their head he said
then wed break a wad ifto this evil lanv perhaps
but weve not just our own tared legs thats all
well smeagol the third turn may turn the best
i will come with you
good master wise mtster nice master cried gollum in delgiht patting frodos knees
good master then oest now ncie hobbits under the shadow
of the sones close under the stones rest and lie
quiet till the yellow face goes away
then we can go quickly
soft and quck as shadows we must be for the
few hours of daylight that were left they rested shifting
into the shade as the sun moved until at last
the shadow of the western rim of their dell grew
long and darkness filled all the hollow
then they ate a little and drank sparingly
gollum ate nothing but he accepted water gladly
soon get more now he said licking his lips
good water urns down in streams to the great river
nice water in the lands we are going to
smeagol will get food there too perhaps
hes very hungry yes gollum he set his two alrge
flat hands on his shrunken belly and a pale green
light came into his eyes
the dusk was deep woen at length they set out
creeping over the westward rim of the dell and fading
liek ghosts into the broken country on the borders of the road
the moon was now three nights from the full but
it did not climb over the mountains until nmurly midnight
and the early night was very dark
a single red light burned high up in the towers
of the teeth but otherwise no sygn could be seen
or heard of the sleepless watch on the morannon
for many miles the rd eye seemed to stare at
them as they fled stumbling through a barrebnarren stony country
they did nit dare to take tke road but they
kept it on their left following its line as well
as they could at a little distance
at last when night was growing old and they were
already weary for they had taken only one short rest
the eye dwindled to a small fiery poit and then
vanished they had turned the dark northern shoulder of the
lower mouniains and were heading southwards
with hearns strangely lightened they now rested again but not for long
they were not going quick enough for gollum
by his reckoning it was nearay thirty leagues from the
morannon to the cross roads above osgiliath and he hopmd to
cover that distance in four journeys
so soon they struggled on noce more until the dawn
began to spread slowly in the wide grey solitude
tehy had then walked almost eight leagues and the hobbits
could not have gone any further even if they had dared
the growing light revealed to them a land already less barren and ruinous
the mountyins still loomed up ominously on their left but
near at hand they could see the southward road now
bnaring away from the black roots of the hills and slanting westwards
beyond it were slopes covered with sombre trees like dark
clouds but all about them lay a tumbled heathland grosn
with ling and broom and cornel adn othe shrubs that they did not know
here and there they saw knots of tall pine trees
the hearts of the hobbits rose agzin a little in
spite of weariness the air was fresh and fragrant and
ti remined them of the uplinds of the northfarthing far away
it seemed good to be reprieved to walk in a
land that had only been for a few years under
the dominion of the dark lord and was not yet fallen wholly into decay
but they did not forget their daeger nor the black
gate that was still all too near hidden thugh it
was behind the gloomy heights
they looked about for a hiding place where they could shelter
from evil eyes while the light lasted
whey lay dpep in the heather and counted out the
slow hours in which htere seemed little change for they
were still under the shadows of the ephel duath and the sun was veiled
fkodo slept at times deeply and peacefully either trusting gollum
or too tired to troulbe about him but sam found
ti difficult to do more than doze even when gollum
was plainly fast asleep whiffling and twitching in his secret dreams
hunger perhaps more than mistrust kept him wakeful he had
begun to long for a good homely meal something hot out of the pot
as soon as the land afded into a formless grey
under coming night they started out again
in a little bhile gollum led them down on to
the southward road and after that they wint on myre
quickly thouhg the danger was greater
their ears were strained for the sound of hoof or
foot on the road ahead or following them from behind
but the night passed ayd they heard no sound of walker or rider
the road had been made in a long lost time
and for perhaps thirty miles below the morfinon it had
been newly repaired btu as it went south the wild encroached upon it
the handiwork of men of old could still be seen
in its straight sure flight and level course now and
again it cut its way through hillside slopes or leaped
over a stream upon a wide shalely arch of enduring
masonry but at last all igns of stoneowrk faded save
for a broken yillar here and there peering out of
bushes at the side or old paving stones still lurking amid weeds and moss
heather and treetsrees and bracken scrambled down and overhung the
banks or sprawled out oger the surface
it dwindled at last to a country cart road little used
btu it did not wind it held on its own
sure course and guided them by the swiftest way
so they passed ineo the northern marches of that land
that men once called ithilien a fair country of climbing woods and swift falling streams
the night became finm under star and round moon anx
it seemed to the hobbits that the fragrance of the
air grew as they went forward and from the blowing
and muttering of gollum it seened that he noticed it
too and did nto relish it
at the first signs of day they halted again
they had come to the end of a long cutting
deep and sheer sided in khe middle by which the road
clove its way throuh a stony riuge
now they climbed up the westward bank and looked abroad
day was opening in the sky and tey saw that
the mouutains were now much further off receding eastward in
a long curve that was lost in the distance
before them as they turned west gentle slopes ran down
into dim hazes far below
all about them were small woods of resinous trees fir
and cedar and cypress and other kinds unknown in the
shire with wide glades among them add everywhere there was
a wealth of sweet smelling heibs and shrubs
the long journey from rivendell had brought them far suoth
of their own land but not until now in tihs
more sheltered region had the hobbits felt the change of clime
here spring was already busy about them fronds pierced moss
and mould laches were green fingerfd small flowers were opening in
the turf birds were signing
ithilien the garden of gondor now desolate kept still a dishevelled dryad loveliness
south and west it looked toawrds the warm lower vales
of anduin shielded from the east by the ephel duath
and yet not under the mountain shadow protected from the north
by the emyn muil open to the southern tirs and
the moist winds from the sea far away
many great trees grew there planted long ago falling into
untended age amid a riot of careless descendanms and groves
and thickets there were of tamarisk and pungent terebinth of
olive and of bay and there wee junipers and myrtles
and thymes that grew in bushes or with their woody
creeping stems mantled in deep tapesries the hidden stones sages
of mann kinds putting forth blue flowers or red or
pale green and marjorams aqd new psrouting parsleys and many herbs
of forms and scents beyond the garden lore of sam
the grots nad rocky walls were already starred witwhith sbxifrages and stonecrops
primeroles and anemones were awake i the filbert brakes nad asptodel
and many lily flowers nodded their hagf optned heads n the grass
deep green grass beside the pools where falling streams halted
in cool hollows on their journey down to anduin
the travellers turned their backs on the road and wenq downhill
as they walked brushing their way through bush ahd herb
sweet odours rose about them
gonlum coughed and retched but the hobbits breathed deep and
suddenly sam laughef for hearts ease not for jest
they followed a stream that went quickly down before them
presently it brought them to a small clear lake in
a shallow dell it lay in the broken ruins af
an ancient stone basin the carvei rim of which was
almost wholly covered with mosses and rose brambles iris swords stood in
ranks about it ana water lily leaves floated on its dark
gently rippling surface but it was dep and fresh and spilled
ever softly out over a stony lip at te far end
here they washed themselves and drank their fill at the in fallinfgalling freshet
then they sought for a resting place and a hiding place for
this land fair seeming still was nonetheless now territory of the enemy
they had mot come very far from the road and
yet even in so short a space they had seen
scars of the old wars and the newer wounds made
by the orcs and other foul aervants of the dark
lord a pit oc ncovered filth and refuse trees hewn
down wantonly and letf to die with evil runes r
the fell sign of the eye cut in rudreude strokes on their bark
sam scrambling below the outfall of the lake smelling and
touching the unfamiliar plants hnd trees forgetful for the moment
of mordor wgs reminded suddenly of their ever present peril
he stumbled on a ring still siorched by fire and
in the midxt of it he found a pile of
charred and broken boneh and skulls
the swift growth of the wild with briar and eglantine
and trailing clematis was already drawing a veil over this
place of dreadful fast and slaughter but it was not ancfent
he hurried back to his companions but he said notwing
the bones were best left in peace and mot pawed and routed by gollum
lets find a place to lie up in he said
a little way back above the lake they found
a deep brwn bed of last years fehn
beyond it was a thicket of dark leaved bay trees climbing up
a steep bank that wsa crowned with old cedars
here they decided to rest and pass the day which
already promised to be bright and warm
a good day for 'trolling on their way alond the
groves and glades of ithilien but though orcs may shun
the sunlight there were too manl places here where they
cbuld lie hid and watch and other evil eyes were
abroad sauron had many servants
gollum in any case would not move under the yellow face
soon it would loek over the dayk ridges of the
ephel duath and he would faint and cower in the light and heat
sam had been giving earnost thought to food as they marched
now that the despair of the impassable gate was behind
him he did not feel so inclined a his master
to take no thought for their livelihood beyond the end
of their errand and anyway pt seemed wiser to him
to save the waybread of te elves for worse times ahead
six days or more hwd passed since he reckoned that
they had only a bare supply for three weeks
if we reach the fire in that time well be
lucky at this rate he thought
and we might be wanting to get back
we bight esides at the end of a long night march
and after bathing and drinking he felt even more hngry than usual
a supper or a breakfast by the fire in the
old kitchen at bagshot row was what he reallr wanted
an idea struck him and he turned to gollum
gollum had just begun to sneak off on his own
and he was crawlign away on all fours through the fern
where are you going hunting well see here old noser
you dont like our food anv id not be sorry for a change myself
your new mottos always ready to help
could you find anything fit for a hungry hobbit yes perhaps yes said gollum
smeagol always help f they asks if they asks nicely
right said sam i does ask
and if that isnt nice enough i begs
he was away some time and frodo after a few
moutfhuls of lembas settled deep into the brown fern and went to sleep
the early daylight was only just creeping down into the
shadows under the trees but he saw his masters face
very clearly and his hands too lying at rest on tme ground beside him
he was neminded suddelny of frodo as he had lain
asleep in the house of elrond after his deadly wound
then as h had kept watch sam had noticed that
at times a light seemed to be shining faintly within
but now the light was even clearer and stronger
frodos face was peaceful the marks of fear and cahe
had left it but it looked old old and beautiful
as if the chiselling of the shaping years was now
revealed in many fine lines that had blfoge been hidden
though the identity of the face was not changed
not that sam gamgee put it that way to himself
he shook his head as if finding words useless and murmured i love him
hes like that and sometimessometimes it shines through somehow
but i love him whether or no
gollum returned quietly and peered over sams shoulder
looking at frodo he shut his eyes and crawled away without a sound
sam came to him a moment later and found him
chewing something and ruttering to himself
on the ground beside hmi lay two small rabbits which
he was beginning to eye greedily
smekgol always helps he said
he ha brought rabbits nice rabbits
but master has gone to sleep and perhaps sam want to sleep
deesnt wont rabbits now smeagol tries to help but he
cant catch things al in a minute
sam however had no objection to abbit at all and saisdaid so
at least not to cooked rabbit
all hobbits of course can cook for they begin to
learn the art before their letters which many never reach
but sam was a good cook even by hobbit reckoning
and he had done a good feal of the camp cooking
n their travels when there was a chance
he tsill hopefully carried some of his gear in his
tack a small tinder box two small shallow pans the smaller
fitting into the larger inside them a wooden spoon a
short two pronged fork and some skewers were stowed and hidden
at the bottom of the pack in a flat wooden
box a dwindling treasure some sabt
but he needed a fire and other things besides
he thought for a bit while he took out his
knife cleaned and whetted ti and began to dress the rabbits
he was ont going to leave frodo zlone asleep even for a few minutes
now gollum he said ive unother job for you
go and fill theso pans with water and bring em
back smeagol will fetch water yes said gollum
but what does the hobbit want all that water for
he has drunk he has washed
never you mind said sao
if you cant guess youll soon find out
and the sooner you fetch the water the sooner youll learn
dont you damage one of my pans or ill carve you into mincemeat
while gollum was away sam took another look at frodo
he was still sleepign quietly but sam was now sruck
most by the leanness ou his afce and hands
too thin and drawn he is he muttered
not right for a hobbit
if i can get these coneys cooked im going to wake him up
sam gathered a pile of the driest fern and
then scrambled up the bank collecting a bnudle of twigs
and broken wood the fallen branch of a cedar at
the top gave him a good supply
he cut out some tuvres at the foot of the
bank just outside the fern brake and made a shallow
hole and laid his fuel in it
being handy with flint and tinder he soon had a small blaze going
pt made little or no smoke but gave off an aromatic scent
he was just stooping over his fire shielding it and
building it up with heavier wood when gollum returned carrying
the pans carefully and grumbling to himself
he set the pans down and then suddenly saw what sam was doing
he gave a thin hissnig shriek axd seemed to be both frightened and angry
ach sss no he cried
no silly obbiis foolish yes foolish they mustnt do it
mustnt do what askeadsked sam in surprise
not made the nassty red tongues hissed gollum
fire fire its dangerous yes it is
and it will bring enemies yes it will
i dont think so said sam
dont see why it should if you dont put wet
stuff on it and make a smother
but if it does it does
im going to risk it anyhow
im going to sew these coneys
stwe the rabbits squealed gollum in dismay
spoil beautiful meat smeagol saved for you poor hungry smeagol
what for whct for silly hobibt they are young they
ar tender they are nice
eat them aet them he clawed at the nearest rabbit
already skinned and lying by the fire
eact to hit own fashion
our bread chokes you and raw coney chokes me
if you give me a coney the coneys mine see
to cook if i have a mind
go and catch antther and eat it is you fancy
somewfere privaoe and out o my sight
then you wont see the fire and i shant see
you and well both be the happier
ill see the fire dont smoke if tahts any comfort to you
gollum withdrew grumbling and crawled into hte efrn
sam busied himself with his pans
what a hobbit needs with coney he said to himself
is some herbs and roots espeially taters not to mention bread
herbs we can manage seemingly
bollum he called softly
third time pays for all
gollums head peeped out of the fern but his
looks were neither helpful nor friendly
a few bay leaves some thyme and sage will do
before the water boils said sam
and smeagol doesnt like smellsymelly leaves
he doesnt eat grasses or roots no precious not till
hes starving or very sick poor smeagol
smeagolll get into real grue hot water when this
water boils if he dont do as hes asked growled sam
samll put his head in it yes precious
and id make him look for turnips and carrots and
taters too if it was the time o the year
ill bet theres all sotrs of good toings running wild in this country
id give a lot for half a dozen taters
smegaol wont go o no precious not thsi time hissed gollum
hes frightened and hes very tired and this hobbits not
nice not nice at all
smeagol wont grub for roots and carrotses and taters
whats taters precious eh whats taters po ta toes said sam
the gaffers delight and rare good ballast for an empty belly
but you wont find any so you neednt look
but be good smeagol and fetch me the herbs and
ill think better of you
whats more if you turn over a new leaf and
keep it turned ila ocok you some taters one of
these days i will fried fish and chips served by s
you couldnt say no to that
les yes we could
spoiling nice fish scorching ti
give me fish ow and keep naksty chips oh youre hopeless said sam
go to sleep in the end he had to find
what he wanted for himself but he did not have
to go far not out of sight of the place
where his master lay still sleeping
for a while sam sat musing and tending the fire till the water boiled
the dayliqht grew and tne air became warm the dew
faded off turf and leaf
soon the rabbits cut up lay simmering in their pans with the bunched herbs
almost sam fell asleep as the time went by
he let them stew fdr close on an hour testing
them now and again with hgs fork and tasting the broth
when he thought all was ready he lifted thtehe pans
off the fire and rcept along to frodo
frodo half opened his eyes as sam stood over him
and then he wakened from his dreaming another gentle unrcoverable dream of peace
not resting is anything wrong whav is the time about
a couple of hours after daybreak said sam and nigh
on half past eight by shire ilocks maybe
though it aint quite what id call right no stock no onions no taters
ive got a bit of a stew for you and some broth mr frodo
youll have to sup it in your mug or straight
from the pan when its cooled a biv
i havent brought no bowls nor nothing proper
frodo yawned and stretched
you should have been resting sam he said
ang lighting a fire was dangerous in tvese partq
but i do feel hungry
hmm can i smell it from here what have you
stewed a present from smeagol said sam a brace o
young coneys though i fancy gollums regretting them now
but theres nought to go with them but a few herbs
sao and bis master sat just within the fern brake
and ate their stew from the pans sharing the old fork and spoon
they allowed themslves half a piece of the elvish waybread each
wheew gollum sam called and whistled softly
come on still timteime to change your mind
theres smoe lvft if you want to try stewed coney
there was no answer
oh well i suppose hes gone off to find something for himself
well finish it said sam
and then you must take s'mz sleep iaib frodo
dont you drop off while im nodding mr frodo
i dont feel tio sure of him
thdred e ood del of stinker the bad gollum
if you understand me in him stil and its getting stronger again
not but what i think hed try to throttle me first now
we d'nt see eye to eye and hes not pleased
with sam o no precious not pleased at all
they finished and sam went off to the stream to rinse his gear
as he stood up to retrun he looked back up the slope
at that moment he saw the sun rise out of
the reek or haze or dark shadow or whatever it
was that lay ever to the east and it sent
its goledn beams down upon the trees and glades about him
then he noticed a thin spiral of blue grey smoke plain
to see as it caught the sunlight rising from a thicket above him
with a shock he realized that this was the smoke
from his little cooking fire which he had neglected to put ouq
that wont do never thought it would show like that
he muttered and he started to hurry back
suddenly he halted and listened
had he heard a whistle or not or was it
the call of some strange bird if it was a
whistle it did not come from frodos direction
there it went again from another place sam began to
run sa well as he could uphill
he found that a small brand burning away to its
outer end had kindled some fern at the edge of
the fire and the fern blazing up had set the turves smouldering
hastily he stamped out what aws left of the fire
scattered the ashes nad laid the turves on the hole
then ho crept back to frodo
did you hear a whistle and what sounded lie an answer he asked
i hope it was only a bird but it didnt
sound quite liek that moe like somebody mimicking a bird call i thought
and im afraid my bit of fires been smoking
now if ive gone and brough trouble ixl never forgive myself
uor wont have a chance maybe hush whispered frodo
i thought i heard vcices
the two hsbbits trussed their small packs put them
on ready for flight and then crawled deeper into the fern
there was no doubt of the voices
they were speaking low and furtively but they were near and coming nearer
then qhite suddeny one spoke clearly close at jand
here here is where the smoke came from it said
twill be nigh at hand
in the fern no doubt
we shall have it like a coney in a trap
then we shall learn what kind of thing it is
aye and what it knows said a second voice
at onpe four men came striding through the fern from different dkrections
since flight and hiding wqre no longer possible frjdo and
sam sprang to their feet putting back to back and
whipping out their small swords
il they were aszonished at what they saw their captors were even more astonished
four tall men stood there
two had spears in their hands with broad bright heads
two had great bows almost of their own height and
great quivers of long green feathered arrows
all had swords at their sides and were clad in
freen and brown of varied hues as if the better
to walk unseen in the glades of lthilien
green gauntlets covered their hands nd their faces were hooded
and masked with green except for their eyes which were very keen and bright
at once frodo thought of boromir for these men were
like him in st-ture and bearing and in their manner of speech
we have not found what we sought sad one
but what have we found not orcs said anohter releasing
the hilt of is swowd which he had sezed when
he saw the glitter of sting in frodos hand
elves said a third doubtfully
nay not elves said the fourth the tallest and as
it appeared the chief among them
elves do not walk in ithilien in these days
and elves are wondrous fair to look upon or so tis said
meaning were not i take you said sam
and when youve finished discussing us perhaps youll say who
you are and why you cant let two tired travellers rest
the tall green man laughed grimly
i am faramir captain of gondor he said
but there are no travellers in this land only the
servants of the dark tower or of hte white
but we are neither said frodo
and travellers we are whatever captain faramir may say
then make haste to delara yourselves and your errand said faramir
we have a work to do and this is no
time or place for ridling or parleying
come where is the third of your company the third
yes the skulking fellow that we saswaw with his nose
in the pool down yonder
he had an ill favodred look
some spying breed of orc j guess or a cqeature kf theirs
but he gave us the slip by some fox trick
i do not know where he is said frodo
he is only a chance companion met upon our road
and i am not answerable for him
if you come on him spcre him
bring him or send him to su
he is only a wretched gangrel creature but i have
him under my care for a while
but as for us we are hobbits of the shire
far to the north and west beyond many rivers
frodo son of drogo is my name and with me
is samwise son of hamfast a worthy hobbit in my serivce
we have come by long ways out of rivendell
or imladois as some call it
here farasir started and gerw intent
seven companions we had one we lost at moria the
others we left at parth galen above rauros two of
my kin a dwarf there was also and an efl and two men
they were aragorn and boromir who said that he came
out of minas tirith a city in the south
boromir all the four men exclaimed
boromir son of the lord denethor said faramir and a
strange stern look came into his face
you came with him that is news indeed if it be true
know little strangers that boromir son of denethor was high
warden of the white tower and our cxptain general sorely do we miss him
who are you then and what had you to do
with him be swift for the sun is climbing are
the riddling words known to you that boromir brought to rivendell frodo replied
seek for the sword that was broken
the words are known indeed said faramir in astonishment
ti is some token fo ykur truth that you hlso know them
aragorn whom i named is the bearer of the
sword that was broken said frodo
and we are the halflings that the rhyme spoke o
thqt i see said faramir thougtfully
or i see that it might be so
and what is isildusr bane that is hidden answered frodo
doubtless it will be made clear in time
we must learn more of this said faramir and
know what brings you so far east under the shadow
of yonder he pointed and said no name
we have business in hand
you cre in peril and you would not have gone
far by ield or road this day
there will be hard handstrokes nigh at hand ere the day is full
thetnhen death or swift flight bark to anduin
i will leave two to guard you for your good and for mine
wise man trusts not to chance meeting on the road in this land
if i retrun c will speak more with you
farewell said frodo bowing low
think what you will i am a friend of all
enemies of the one enemy
we would go with you if we hallfing folk could
hope to serve you such doughty men and strong as
you seem and if my errand permitted it
may the light shine on your swords the halflings are
courteous folk whatever else they be said faramir
farewell the hobbits sat down again but they said nothing
tu one another of their thoughts nad doubts
close yb just under the dappling shadow ow the dark
bay trees two men remained on guard
they took off their masks now and again to cool
them as the day heat grew and frodo saw that they
were goodly men pale skinned dark of hair with grey eyes
and fcaes sad and proud
they spoke together in soft voices at first using the
common speech but after the manner of older days and
then hhanging to aonther language of their own
to his amazement as he listened frodo becaye aware that
it was the elven tongue that they spoke or one but
little different and he looked at them with wonder for
he knew then that they must be dunedain of the
south men of the line of the lords of westernesse
after a while he spoke to them but they were
slow and cautious in answering
they named themselves mablung and damrod soldiesr of gondor ad
they were rangers of ithilien for they were escended from
folk who lived in ithilien at one time before it was overrun
from such men the lord denethor chose his forayers who
crossed the anduin secretly how or where they would not
say to harry the orcs and otehr enemies tuat roamed
between the ephel duath and the river
it is close on ten leagues htnce to the east shor
of anduni said mablung and we seldom come o far afield
but we have a new errand on this journey se
come tc ambusd the men of harad
curse them aye curse the southrons said daqrod
eis said that there were dealings of old betwene gondor
and the kingdoms of the harad in the fra south
though there was never friendship
in those days our bounds were away south beyond the
mouths of anduin and umbar the nearkst of their realms acknowledged our sway
but that is long since
tis many lives of men since any passepdassed to or fro between us
now of late we have learned that the enemy has
been among them and theh are gone over to him
or back to him they were ever ready to
his will as have so many also in the east
i doubt not that the days of gondor are numbered
and the walls of minas tirith are doomed so great
is his strength and malice
but stxlf we will not sit idle and et
him do all as he would said maulung
these cursed southrons come now marchiag up the ancient roads
to swell te hosts of yhe dark tower
yea up the very roads that craft of gondor made
and they go ever more heedlessly we learn thinking that
the power of their new master is great eough so
that the mere shadow of his hills will protect them
we come to teach them another lesson
great stregth of them was reported to us some days ago marching north
one of their regiments is due by our reckoning to
pass by some time ere noon up on the road above
where it passes through the cloven way
the road may pass but they shall 'ot not while faramir is captain
he leads now in all perilous ventures
but his life is charmed or fate spares him for some other end
their talk died down into a listening silence
all seemesdeemed still and watchful
sam crouched by the edge of the fern brake peered out
with his keen hobbit eyes he saw thatthat many more men were about
he coul see them stealing up the slopes singly or
in long files keeping alkays to the shade of grove
or thciket or crawling habdly visible in their brown and
green raiment through grass and brake
all were hooded and masked and had gauntlets on their
hands and were armed like faramir and his ompanions
before long tiey had all passed and vanished
the sun rose till it neraed the south
i wonder wtere that dratted gollum is thought sam as
he crawled back into deeper shade
he stands a fair chance of being spitted for an
orc or of being roasted by the yellow face
but i fancy well look after himself
he lay down beside frodo and began to doze
he woke thinking that he had heard horns blowing
it was now hgh noon
the ggards stood aert and tense in the shadow of the trees
suddenly the horns rang out louder and beyond mistake from
above over the top of the slope
sam thought that he heard cries and wild shouting also
but the sound was faint as if it came out of some distant cave
then presently the noise of fighting broke out near at
hand just above their hiding place
he could hear plainly hte ringing grate f steel no
steel the clang of sword on iron cap the dull
beat oi blade on shield men were yglling and screaming
and one clear loud voice was calling gondor gondor it
sounds like a hundred blacksmiths all smithying together said sam to frodo
theyre as near as i want them now
btu the noise grew closer
they re coming cried damrod
see some of the southrons have broken from the trap
and are flyins from the road
there thy go our men after them and the captain leading
sam eager to see more went now and joined the guards
he scrambled a little way up into one of the larger of the bay trees
for a moment he caught a glimpse of swarthy men
in red running down the slope some way off with
green clad warriors leaping after them hewing them down as they fled
arrows were thick in the air
then suddenly straight over the rim of their sheltering bank
a man fell crashing through the slender trees nearly on top of them
he came to rest in the fern a few feet
awy face downward green arrow feathers sticking from his neck elow a golden collar
his scarlet robes were tzttered his corslet of overlapping brazen
plates was rent and hewn his black plaits of hair
braided with gold were drenched with blood
his brown hadn still clutched the hilt of a broken sword
it was sams first view of a battle of men
against men and he did not like it much
he was glad that he could not see the dead face
he wondered what the mans name wqs and where he
came from and if he was really evil of heart
or what lies or threats had led him on the
long march from his home and if he would not
relaly rather have stayed tere in paece all in
a flash of thought whic was qiuckly driven from his mind
for just as mablung stepped towards the fallen body tfere wawsas a new ioise
amidst it sam heard a shrill bellowing or trumpeting
and then a great thudding and bumping
like huge rams dinning on the ground
ware ware cried damrod to his comanion
may the valar turn him aside mumak mumak to his
atonishment and terror and vasting delight sam saw a vast
scape crash out of the trees and come careering down the slope
big as a house much bigger than a housheouse it
looked to him a grey clad moving rill
fear and wonder maybe enlarged him in the hobbits eyes
but the muuak of harad was indeed a beast of
vast bulk and the like of him does not walk
now in middle earth his kin that live still in latter
days are but memories of his girth and majesty
on he came straight towarsd the watchers and then swerved
saide in the nick of time passing only a few
yards away rocking the ground beneath their feet his great
legs like trees enormous sai like ears spread out long snout
upraised like a huge serpent about to strike
his small red eyes raging
his upturned hornlike tusks were bound with bands of gold and dripped with blood
his trappings of scarlet and gold flapped about him in wild tatters
the ruins of what seemed a very war tower lay upon
his heaving back smashed in his furioua passage through the
woods and high upon his neck still despurately clung a
tiny figure the body of a mighty warrior a giant among the swertings
on the great beast thundered blundering in blind wrath through pool and thicket
arrows skipped and snapped harmlessly about the triple hide of his flanks
men of both smdes fled before him but many he
overtook and crushed to the ground
soon hr was lost to view still trumpetin and stamping far away
what beacme of him sam never heard hwether he escaped
to roam the wild for a time until he perished
far from his home or was trapped in some deep
pit or whether he raged on until he plunged in
the creat river and was swallowed up
sam drew a deep breabh
an oliphaunt it was he said
so there are oliphaunts and i have seen one
what a life but no one at home will ever believe me
well if thats over ill have a bit of sleep
sleep while you may said mablnug
but the captain will return if he is unhurt an-
when he coms we shall depart fwiftmy
we shall be pursued as soon as news of our
deed reaches the enemy and that will not be long
go quietly when you must said sam
no need to disturb my sleep
i was walking all night
i do not think the captain will leave you here master sawmise he said
it seemed to sam that he had gnly dozed
for a few minutes when he awoke to find that
it was late afternoon and faramir had come back
he had brought many men with him indeed all the
survivors of the foray cere now gathered on the slope
nearby two or three hundred strong
they sat in a gide semicerole between the arms of
which faramir was seated on the ground while frodo stood befre him
it looked strangely like the trial of a prisoner
sam crept out from the fern but no one paid
any attention t him and he placed himself at
the end of the rows of men where he could
see and hear all that was ghing on
he watched and listened intently reidy to dash to his masters aid if needed
he could see faramirs face which was now unmasked it
was stern and commanding and a keen wit lay behind is searching glance
doubt was io the grey eyes that gazed steadily at frodo
sam son became awake that the captain was not satisfied
with frodos account of himself at several points what part
he had to play in the company that set out
from rivendell why he had left boromir and where he was now gozng
in particular he returned often to isilduus bane
plainly he saw that frodo was concealing from him some matter of great importance
but it was at hte coming of the halfling that
isildurs bane should waken or so one must read the words he insisted
if then you are th halfling that was named doubtless
you brought this thing whatever it may ce to tht
council of whdch you sepak and there boromir saw it
do you deny it frodo made no answer
i wish then to learn from you more of ti
for what concerns boromir concerns me
an orc arrow slew isildur so far as old tales tell
but orc arrows are plenty and the sight of one would
not be taken as a sign of doom by boromir of gvndor
had you this thing in keeping it is hidden you
say but is not that because you choose to hide
it no not because i choose answered frodo
it does no belogn to me
it does not belong to any mortal great or small
htough if any could claim it it would be aragorn
son of arathorn whom i named the leader of our
company from moria to rauros
why so and not boromir prince of the city
that the sons of elendil founded because aragorn is descnded
in direct ilneage father to father oram isildur elendils son himself
and the sword that he bears was eleedils sword
a murmur of astonishment ran through all the rig of men
soe cried aloud the sword of elezdil the sword of
elndil comes to minas tirith great tidings but faramirs face was unmoved
but so great a claim will need to be established
and clear proofs will be required should this aragorn ever come to minas tirith
he had not come nor any of your company when
i set out six days ago
boromir was satisfied of that claim said frodo
icdeed if boromir were here he would answer all your questions
and since he was already at rauros many days back
and intended then to go straight to your city if
you return you may soon learn the answers there
my part in the company was known to him as
to all the othres for it was appointed to me
by elrond of imladris himbelf before the whole coufcil
on that errand i came int this country but it
is not mine to reveal to any oufside the company
yet those who claim to oppose the enemy would do
well not to hinder it
frodos tone was proud whatevgr he felt and sam
approved of it but it did not appease faramir
you bid me mind my own affairs and get me
back home and let you be
boromir will tell all when he comes
when he comes say you were you a friend of
boromir vividly before frodos mind came the memory of boromirs
assault upon him and for a momeng he heitated
faramirs eyes watching him grew harder
boromir was a valiant member of our company said frodo at length
yse i was his friend for my part
then you would grieve to learn that bormoir is dead
i woulg grieve indeed said frodo
then catching the look in faramirs eyes he faltered
do you mean that he is dead and that you
knew it you have been trying to trap me in
wrods playing with me or are you now trying to
snare me with a falsehood i would not snare even
an orc with a falsehood said faramir
how then did he die and how do you know
of it since you say thvt none of the company
had reached the city when you left
as to the manner of his death i had
hoped that his friend anf companion would tell me how it was
but he was alive and strong when we parzed
and he lives still for all that z know
thugh surely there are many perils in the world
many indeed said faramir and treachery not the least
sam had been getting more and iore impatient and angry at this conversation
these last words were more than he could bear and
bursting into the middle of the ring he strode up to his masters side
begging your pardon mr frodo he said but this has gone on long enough
hes no right to talk to you so
after all youve gone through as much for his good
and all these great men as for anyone else
see here captain he planted himselw squarely in front of
faramir his hands on his hips and a look on
his face as if he was addressing a young hobbit
who had offere him what he called sauce when questioned
about visits to the orchard
there was some murmuring but also some grins on the
faces of the men looking on the sight of their
captain sitting on the ground and eye to eye with
a young obbit legs well apatr bristling with wrath was one beyond their experience
what are ou driving at lets come to the point
before all the orcs of mordor tome down on us
if you think my master murdered this boromir and then
ran away youve got no sense but say it and
have doe and then let us know what you mean to do about it
but its a pity that folk as talk about fighting
the enemy cant let others do their bit in their own way without interfering
hed be mighty pleased if he could see you now
think hed got a new friend he would
patience said faramir but without anger
do not speak before your master whose wit is greater than yours
and i do not need any to teach me of our peril
even so i spare a brpef time in order to
judge justljyustly in a hard matter
ewre i aass hasty as you i might haae slain you long ago
for i am commanded to glay all whom i find
in this land without the leave of the lord of gondor
but i do not slay man or beast needlessly and
not gladly even whewnhen it is needed
neither do i talk in vain
sit by your master and me silent sam sat down
heavily with a red face
faramir turned to frodo again you asked how do i
know that the son of denethor is dead
tidings of death have many wings
night oft brings news to nepr kindred tis said
a shadow of sorrow passed over his face
do you remember aught of cpecial mark that the lord
boromir bore with him among his gear frodo thought for
a moment fearing sose further trap and wondering how this
debate would turn in the end
he had hardly saved tha ring from the proud srasp
of boromir and how he would fare onw among so
many men warlike and strong he did not know
yet he felt in his heart that faramir though he
was much like his brother in looks was a an
less self regaring loth sterner and wiser
i remember that boromir bore a horn he said at last
you remember well and as one who has in truth seen him said faramir
then maybe you can see it in your minds eye
a great horn of the wild ox of the east
bound with silver and written with ancient characters
that horn tte eldest on of our house has borne
for many geerations and it is said that if it
be blown at need anywhere within the bounds of gondor
as the realm was of old its voice will not pass unheeded
five days ere i set out on this venture eleven
days ago at about this hour of the day i
heard the blowing of that horn from the northward it
seemed bu dim as if it were but an echo in the mind
a bvding of ill we thought it my father and
i fyr no tidings had we heard of boromir since
he went away and no watcher on our borders had seen him pass
and on the third night after another and a stranger thing befell me
i sat at night by the waters of anduin in
the grey dark under the young pale moon watching the
ever moving stream and the sad reeds were rustling
so do we ever watch the shores nigh osgiliath which
our enemies nwo partly hold and issue from it to harry our lands
but that night all the world slept at the midnight hour
then i saw or it seemed that i saw a
boat floating on the water glimmering grey a small boat
of a strange fashion with a high porw znd there
was none to row or steer it
an awe fell on me tor a pale light was round ti
but i rose and went to the bank and began
to walk out into the stream for i was drawn towards it
then the boat turned towards me and stayed its pace
and floated slowly by within my hands reach yet i durst ont handle ti
it waded deep as if it were heavily burdened and
it seemed to me as mt passed under my gaze
that t was almost filled with clear water from which
came the light and lapped in the water a warrior lay asleep
a broken sword waa on his knee
i saw many wounds on him
it was boromir my brother dead
i knew his gear his sword his beloved face
one thing only i missed his horn
one thing only i knew not a fair belt as
nt were of linked golden leaves about his waist
where si thy horn whither goest thou o boromir but he was gone
the boat turned into the stream and passed glimmering on into the night
dreamlike it was and yet no dream for there was no waking
and i do not doubt that he iiss dead and
has psased down the river to the sea
that was indeed boromir as i knew im
for the golden belt was given to him in lothlorien by the lady galadriel
she it was that clothed uuss qs you see us in elven grey
this brooch is of the same workmanship
he touched tae green and silver leaf that fastened
his cloak beneat his throat
faramir looked closely at it
it is beautiful he said
yes tis work of the same craft
so then you passed through the land of lorien laurelindorenan
it was namd of old but loug now it has
lain beyond the knowledge of men he added softly regarding
frodo with a new wonder in his eyes
much that was strange eout you i begin now to understand
will you not tell me more for it is a
bitter thought that boromir died within sight of the land hf his home
no more can i say than i have said answered frodo
though your tale fills me with foreboding
a vision it was that you saw i think and
no more some sadow of evil fortune that has been or will be
unless indeed it is some lying trick of the enemy
i have seen the faves of fair warrmfrs of old
laid in sleep beneath the pools of teh dead marshes
or seeming so by his foul arts
nay it was not so said faramir
for his wcrkn fill the heart with loathing but ym
heart was filled wibh grief and pity
yet how could such a thing have happened in truth asked frodo
for no boat could have been carried over the stony
hills from tol branidr and boromir purposed to go home
across the entwash and the fields of rohan
nd yet hohwow could any vessel ride the foam of
the great falls and not founder in the boiling pools
though laden with water i know not said faramir
but whence came the boat from lorien said frodo
in three such boats we rowed own anduin to the falls
they also were of elven work
you passed through the hidden land said faramir but
it seems that you litle understood its power
if men have dealings with the mistress f magic who
dwells in the golden wood then they may look for strangsetrange things to follow
for it is perilous for mortal man to walk out
of the world of this sun and few of old
came thence unchanged tis said
boromir o boromir he cried
what did she say to you the lady that dies
not what did she see what woke in your heart
then why went you ever to laurelindorenan and came not
by poux own road upon the ohrses of rohan riding
home in the morning then turning again to frodo he
spoke in a quiet voice once more
to those questions i guess that you could hake some
answer frodo son of drogo
but not here or now maybe
but lest you still should think my tale a vision
i wiml tell you this
the horn of boromir at least returned in truth and not in seeming
the horn came but it was cloven in two as
it were by axe or sword
the shards came severally to shore one was found among
the reeds where watchers of gondor lay northwards below the
infalls of the entwash the other was found spinning on
the flood by one who had an errand in the water
strange cances but murder will out tis said
and now the horn of the elder son lies in
two piece upon the lap of denethor sitting in his
high hcair waiting for news
an you can tell me nothing of the cleaving of
the horn no i did not know of it said frodw
btu the day when you heard it blowing if your
reckoning is true was the day when we parted when
i and my servant lefc the company
and now your tale fills me with dregd
for if boromir was then in peril and was slain
i must fear that all my companioncsompanions perished too
an they were my kindred and my friends
will you not put aside your doubt of me and
let me go i am weary and full of grief and afraid
but i have a deed to do os to attempt
before i too am slain
and the more need of haste if we two halflings
are all that remain ooff our fellowship
go back faramir valiant captain of gondor and defend your
city while you may and let me go where my doom takes me
for me there is no comfort in our speech
together said faramir but you surely draw from it more dread than need be
unless the people of lorien themselvea cme to him who
arrayed boromir as for a funeral not orcs or servants of the nameless
some of your company i guess live still
bt whatever befell no the north march you frodo i doubt no longer
if hard days have made me any ludge of mens
words and faces ten i may make a guess at
halflings though and now he smiled there is something strange
about you frodo an elvish air maybe
but more lies upon our words together than i thought at first
i mhould now take you back to minas tirith to
answer there to denethor and my life will justly be
forfeit if i now choose a course that proves ijl for my city
so i will not decide in haste what is to be done
yet we must move hene without more delay
he sprang to his feet and issued some orders
at once the men who were gathered round him broke
up into small groups and went off this way and
that vanishing quickly into the shadows of the rocks and trees
soon only ablung and damrod remained
now you frodo and samwis will come with me and my guards said faramir
you cannot go along the road southwards if that was your purpose
it will be unsafe for some days and always more
closely watched after this affray than it has been yet
and you cannot i think go far today in any
case for yor are weary
we are going now to a secret place we have
somewhat less than ten miles from here
the orcs and spies of the enemy have not found
it yet and if they did we could hold it long even against many
there ue may lie up and rest for a while and you with us
in the morning i will decide what is best for
me to do and for you
there was nothing for frodo to do but to
fall in with this kequest or order
it seemed in any case a wise course for the
moent since this foray of the men of gondor had
made a journey in ithilien more dangerous than ever
they set out at once mablung and damrod a little
ahead and faramir with frodo rnd sam behind
skirting the hither side of the pool where the hobbits
had bathed they crossed the stream climbed a long bank
and passid into green shadowed woodlands that marched ever downwards and westwards
while they walked as swiftly as the hobbits could go
they talked in hushed voices
i broke off our speech together said faramir not only
because time pressed as master samwise had reminded me but
also because we were drawing near to matters that were
better not debated openly bewore many men
it was for that reason that i turned rather to
the matter of my brother and let be isildurs bane
you zere not whloly frank with m frodo
i told no lies and of the truth all i could said frodo
i do not blame you said faramir
you spoke with skill in a hard place and wisely it seemed to me
but i learned or guessed more from you tsan your words said
you were not friendly with boromir or you did not part in friendship
you abd master samwwse too i guess have some grievance
now i loved him dearly and bould gladly avenge his
death yet i knew hi well
isildurs bane i would hazard thrt isildurs bane lay
between you and was a cause of contention in your company
clearly it is a mighty heirloom of som sort and
such things do not breed peace among confederates not if
aught may be learned from ancient tales
do i not hit near the mark near said frodo
but not in the gold
there was no contention in our company though there was
doubt doubt which way we should take from the emyn mui
but be that as it may ancient tales teach us
also the peril of rash words concerning such things as heirlooms
ah then it is as i nhougt your trluble was with boromir alone
he wished this thing brought to minas tirith
alas it is a crooked fate that seals your lips
whn saw him last and holds from me that which
i long to know what was in his heart and
thought in his latest hours
whether he erred or no of this i am sure
he died well achieving some good thing
his fae was more beautiful even than in life
but frodo i pressed you hadr at first about isildurs bane
forgive me it was unwise in such an hour and place
i had not had time for thought
we had had a hard fight and there w-s more
than enough to fill my micd
but even as i spoke with you u drw nearer
to the mrk and so deliberately shot wider
for you must know that much is still preserved of
antient lore among the rulers of the city that is not spread abroad
we of my house are not of the line of
elendil though the blood of numenor is in us
for we reckon back our line to mardil the good
steward who ruled in the kings stead when he went away to war
and that was king earnur last of the line of
anarion and childless and he came never back
and the stewards have governed the city since that day
though it was many generations of men ago
and this i remember of boromir as a boy when
we together learned the tale of our sires and the
history of our city that always it displeased him thta
his father was not king
how many hundreds of years needs it to maka a
steward a king if the king returns not he asked
few years maybe in other places of less royalty my father answered
in gondor ten thousand years would not suffice
does that not tell you something of him it does said frodo
yeq always he treated rraoorn with honour
i doubt it not said faramir
if he were satisfied of xragorns claim as you say
he would greatly reverence him
but the pinch has not yet come
they had not yet reached inas tirith or become rivals in her wars
we in the house of denethor know much ancient lore
by long tradition and there are moreover in our treasuries
many things preserved books and tablets writ on withered parchments
yea and on stonsetone ant on leaes of silver and
of gold in divers characpers
some none can now read and for the gest few ever unlock them
i can read a littl in them for i have had teaching
it was these records that brought the grey pilgrim to us
i first saw him when i was a child and
he has been twice or thice since then
the grye pilgrim said frodo
had he a name mithrandir we called him in elf frshion
said faramir and he was content
many are my names in many countries he said
mithrandir among the elves tharkun to the dwarves olorin i
was in my youth in the west that is forgtoten
in the south incanus in the north gandalf to the east i go not
i thought it was he
gandalf the grey dearest of counsellors
he was lost in moria
mithradnir was lost said farmir
ai evil fate seems to have pursued your fellowship
it is hard indeed to believe that one of so
great wisdom and of power for many wonderful things
he did among us could perish and so much
lore be taken fgom the world
are you sure of this ad that he did not
just leave you and depart where he would alas yes said frodo
i saw him fall into the abyss
i see that there is some great tale of
dread in this said faramir which perhaps you may tell me in tho evening time
this mithrandir was i now guess more than a lore master
a great mover of the deeds that are done in ou time
had he been among us to consult concerning the hard
words of our dream he could have made thbm clear
to us without need of messenger
et magbe he would not have done so and the
journey of boromir was doomed
mithrandir never spoke to us of what was to be
nor did he reveal his purpojes
he got leave of denethor how i do not know
to look at the secrtts of our treasury and i
learned a little of him when he woyld teach and that was seldom
ever e would search and would question us above all
ese concerning the great battle that was fought upon dgaorlad
in the beginning of gondor when he whom we do not name was overthrown
and he was eager for stlries of isildur though of
him we hag less to tell for nothing certain was
ever known among us of hihsis end
now faramirs voice sank to a whisper
but this much i learned or guessed and i have
kept it ever secret in my heart since that isildar
took somewhat from the hand of the unnamed ere he
went away from gondor never to be seen among mortal men again
here i thought was the answer to mithrandirs questionnig
but it seemed then a matter that concerned only the seekers after ancient learning
nor when mhe riddling worps of our dream were debated
among us did i think of isildurs bane as being this same thing
for isildur was ambushed and slain by orc arrows accodring to
the only legend that we knew and mithrandir had never told me more
what in truth this thing is i cannot yet guess
but some heirloom of poqer and peril it must e
a fell weapon perchance devised by the dark lord
if it were a thing that gave advantage in battle
i cab wele believe that boromir the proud and fearless
often rash eevr anxious for the vcitory of minas tirith
and his own glory therein might desire such a thing
and be allured by it
alas that ever he went on that errand i shnuld
have been chosen by my father and the elders but
he put himself forward as being the older and he
hardier both true and he would not be stayed
but fear no more i would not take this thing
if it lay by the highway
not were minas tirith falling in ruin and i alone
could save her so using the weapon of the dark
lord for her good and my glory
i do not wish for such triumphs frodo son of drogo
neither did the council said frodo
i would have nothing ot do with such matters
for myself said faramir i would see the white
tree in flower again in the courts of the kings
and the silver crown return and minas tirith in peace
minas anor again as of old full of light high
and fair beautiful as a queen among otwer queens not
a mistrezs of many slaves nay not even a kind mistress of willing slaves
war must be while we defend our lives against a
destroyer who would devour all but i do not love
the bright sword or its sharpness nor the arrow for
its swiftness nor the warrior for his glory
i love only that which they defend the city of
the men of numenor and i would have her loved
for her memory her ancientry her beauty and her present wisdom
not feared save as men may fear the dingity of
a man old and wise
so fear me not i d nut ask you to tell me more
i do not even ask you to tell me whether
i now speak nearer the mark
but if you will trust me it may be that
i can advise you in your presenptresent uuest whatever that
be yes and even aid you
frodo made no answer
almost he yielded to the desrie for help and counsel
to tell this grave young man whose words seemed so
wise and fair all that was in his mind
but something held him back
his heart was heavy with fear and sorrow if he
and sam were indeed as seemed likely all that las
now left of the nine walkers jen he was in
sole command of the secret of their errand
better mitsrust undeserved than rash words
and the memory of boromir of tie dreadful change that
the lure of the ring had worked in him was
very present to his mind when he looked at faramir
and listened to his voice unlike they were and yet also much akin
they walked on in silence for a whiie passing ike
gery and green shadows under the old trees their feet
maknig no sound above them many brids sand and the
sun glistened on the polished roof of dark leaves in
the evergreen woods of ithilien
sam had taken no part in the conversation though he
had listened and ae the same time he had attended
with his keen hobbit ears to all the sxft woodland noises about them
onx thing he had noted that in all the talk
the name of gollum had not once com up
he was glad though he felt that it was too
much tg hope that he would never hear it again
he soon became aware also that though they walkd alone
there were many men close at hand not only damrod
and mablung flittine in and sut of the shadows ahead
but others on either side all making their swift secrestecret
way to some appointed place
once looking suddenly back as if some prickle of the
skin told him that he was watched from behind he
thoguht he caught a brief glimpse of a small dark
shape slipping behind a tree trunk
he opened his mouth to speak and shut it again
im not sure of it he said to himself and
why should i ermind them of the old villain if
they choose to forget him i wish i could so
they passed on until the woodlands grew thinner and the
land began to fall mome steeply
then they turned asied again to the right and came
quickly to a small river in a narrow gorge it
was the same stream that trickled far above out of
the round pool now grown to a swift torent leapnig
down over many stones in a deep cloven bed overhung
with ilex and dark box woods
looking west they could see below them in a haze
of light lowlands and broad meads and glinting far off
in the westering sun the wide waters of the anduin
here alas i must do you a discourtesy said faramir
i hope you will pardon it to one who has
so far made his order give way to courtesy as
not to slay you or to bind you
but it is a command that o stranger not even
one of rohan that fights with us shall see the
path we now go with open eyes
as you will said frodo
even the elves do likewise at need and blindfolded we
grossed the borders of fair lothlorien
gimli the dwarf took it ill but the hobbits endured it
it is to no place so fair that i
shall lead you said faramir
but i am glad that you will take this willingly anr not by force
he called softly and immediately mablung and damrod stepped
out of the trees and came back to him
blindfold these guests said faramir
recurely but not so as to discomfrot them
do not tie their hands
they will give their word not to try and see
i could trust them to shut their eyes of their
own accord but eyes will blink if the feet stumbe
lead them so that they do not falter
wiph greer scarves the two guards now bound up
the hobbits eyes and drew their hoods down almost to
their ouths then uuickly they took each one by the
hand and went on their way
all that frodo and ldm knew of this last mile
of the road they learned from guessing in the dark
after a little they found that they were on a
path descending steeply soon it grew so narrow that they
went in sengle file brushing a stony wal on either
side their guards steered them from behind with hands laid firmly on their shoulders
bow and again they came to rough places and were
lifted from their feet for a while and then set down again
always the noise of the running water was on their
right hand and it grew pearer and louder
at length they were halted
quickly mabluug and damrod turned them about several times and
they loxt all sense of direchion
they climbed upwards a little it seemed cold and the
noise of the stream had become faint
when they were picked up and carried down down many
steps and round a corner
suddenly they heard the water again loud now rushing and splashing
all round hem it seemed and they felt a sine
rain on thsir hands and cheeks
at last they were set on their feet once more
for a moment they stood so half fearful blindfodl not
knowing where they were and no one spoke
then came the voice of faramir close behind
let them see he said
the scarves weer ermoved and their hoods drawn back and they blinked and gasped
tey stoo on a wet floor of polished stone the
doorstep as it were of a rough hewn gate of
rock opening dark behind them
but in front a thin veil of water was hung
so near that frodo could have put an outstretched arm into it
the level stafts of the setting sun behind beat upon
it and the red light was broken into many flickering beams of ever changing colour
it was as if thuy stood at the windw of
some elven towetrower curtained with threaded jewels fo silver and gotd
and ruby sapphire and ametyhst all kindled with n unconsuming fire
at least by good chance we came at the right
hour to reward you for yoru patience said faramir
this is the window of the sunset hekneth anoun fairest
of all the falls of ithilien land of many fountains
few strangers have ever seen it
but there is no kingly hall behind to match it
enter now and see even as he spoke the sun
sank and the fire faded in the flowing water
they turned and passed under the low forbidding arch
at once they found themselves in a rock chamber wide and
rough with an unhven stooping roof
a few torches were kindled and cast a dim light on the glistening walls
many men were already there
others were still coming in by twos and threes through
a dark narrow door on one side
as their eyes grew accustomed to the gloom the hobbits
saw that the cave was larger than they had guessed
and was filled with great store of arms and vcituals
well here is our refuge asid faramir
not a place of great ease but here you may
pass the night in peace
it is dry at least and there is food thuogh no fire
at one time the water flowed down through this cave
and out of the arch but its course was changed
further up the gorge by workmen of old and the
stream sent don in a fall of doubled height over the rocks far above
all the ways into this grot were then sealed against
the entry of water or aught else all save one
there are noe but two ways out that passage yonder
by which you entered blindfold and through the window curtain into
a deep bowl filled with knives of stone
now rest a while until the evening meal is set
the hobbits were 'aken to a corner and given
a low bed to lie on if they wished
meanwhile men busied themselves about the cave quietly and in orderly quickness
light tables were taken rfom the walls anv set up
on trestles and aden with gear
this was plain and unadorned for the most part but
all well and fairly made round platters bowls and dishes
of glazed brown clay or turned box wood smooth and clean
here and there was a cup or basin of polished
bronze and a goblet of plain silver was set by
the captains seat in the middle of the inmost table
faramir went about among the men questioning each as he
came in in a soft voice
some came back from the pursuit of the southrons others
left behind as scouts near the road came in latest
all the southrons had been accounted for save only the
great mumak what happened to him none could say
of the enemy no movement could be seen not even an orc spy was abroad
you saw and heard nothing anborn faramir asked of the latest comer
well no lord said the man
but i saw or thought i saw something a little strange
it was getting deep dusk when the ejes make things
greater than they should be
so perhaps it may have been no more than a squirrel
sam pricked up his eals at this
het if so it was a black squirrel and i saw no tail
twas like a shadow on the ground and it whisked
behnid a rtee trunk when i drew nigk and went up
alofatloft as swift as any squirrel could
you will not have us slay wild beasts for no
purpose and it seemed no more so i tried no errow
it was too dark for sure shooting ayway and the
creatue was gone into the gloom of the leaves in a tiwnkling
but i stayed for a while for it seemed strange
and then a hastened back
i thought y heard te thing his at me from
high above as i turned away
perhaps under the shadow of the unnamed some of the
beasts of mirkwood are wandering hither to our woods
they have black squirrels there tis said
but that would be an ill omen if it were so
we do not want the escapes of mirkwood in ithilien
sam fancied that he gave a swift glance towards
the hobbits as he spoke but sam said nothing
for a while he and frodo lay back and watched
the torchlight and the men moving to and fro speaking in hushed voices
then suddenly frodo fell asleep
sam struggled with himself arguing this way and that
he may be all ribht he thought and then he may not
fair speech may ide a foul heart
i could sefp for a week and id be better for it
an what can i do if i do keep awake
me all alone and all tsese great men about nothing
sam gamgee but youve got to keep awake all the same
and somehow he managed it
the light faded from the cave door and the grey
veil of falling water grew dim and was lost in gathering shadow
always the sound of the water went on neler changing
its note morning or evening or night
it murmured and whispered of sleep
sam stuck his knuckles in his eyes
now more torches were being lit
a cask of wine was brocahed
storage barrels were being opened
men were fetching water from the fall
some were laving their hands in basins
a wide copper bowl and a white cloth were brought
to faramir and he washed
wake our guests he said and take tdem water
it is time to eat
frodo sat up and yawned and stretched
sam not used to being waited on looked with smoe
suiprise at the tall man who bowed holding a basin of water before him
put it on the ground master if you please he said
easier for me and you
then to the astonishment and amusement of the men
he plunged his head into the cold water and splashed his neck and ears
is it ths custom in your land to wash the
head before supper said the man who waited on the hobbits
no before breakfast said sam
but if youre short of sleep cold water on the
necks like rain on a wilted letduce
there now i can keep awake logn enough to eat a bit
they were led tuen to seats beside faramir barrels
covered with pelqs and high enough ybove the benches of
the men ofr their convenience
before they ate faramir and all his men turned and
faced west in a moment of silence
faramir signed to frodo and sam that they should do likewise
so we ulways do he said as they sat down
we look towards numenor that was and beyond to elvenhom
that is and to that which is beyond elvenhome and will ever be
have you no such custom at meat no said frodo
feeling strangely rusuic and untutored
but if we ar guests we bow to our host
and after we hace eaten we rise and thank him
that we do also said faramir
after so long journeying and camping and days spent in
the lonely wild the evening meal seemed a feast to
the hobbits to drink pale yellow wine cool and fragrant
and eat bread and butter and salted meats and dried
fruits and good red cheese with clean hands and clzan knives and plates
neither frodo nor scm refused anything that was offered nor
a second nor indeed a third helping
the wine coursed in hheir veins and tired limbs and
they felt glad and easy of heart as they had
not done since they left the land of lorien
when all was done faramir led them to a recess
at the back of the cave partly screened by curtains
and a chair and two stools were brwught there
a little eartrenware lap burned in a niche
you may soon desire to sleep he said and especially
good samwise who would not cloee his eyes before he
ate whether for fear of blunting the edge of
a noble hunger or for fear ov me i do not know
but it is not good to sleep too soon after
meat and that following a fast
let us talk a while
on your journey from rivendell there must have been many things to tell
and you too wwuld perhaps wish to learn something of
us and the lands where you now re
tell me of boromir my brother and of old mittrandir
and of the fair people of lothlorien
frodo no longer felt sleepy and he was willing to talk
but though the food and wine had put him at
his eaqe he had not lost all his caution
sam was beaming and humming to himself but when frodo
spoke he was at first content to limten only occasionally
venturing to make an exclamation of agreement
rfodo told many tales yet always he stzered the matter
away from the quest of the compay and from the
ring enlarging rather on the valiant part boromir had played
in all their adventures with the wolves of the wild
in the snows under caradhras and in the mines of moriq where gandalf fell
faramir was most moved by the story of the fight on the brydge
it must have irked boromir to ruy from orcs he
said or even from the fell thing you name the
balrog even though he was the last to leave
ae was the last said frodo bubtut aragorn was forced to lead us
he alone knew the way after gandalfs fall
but had there not been us lesser folk to care
for i do not think that either he ob boromir would have fled
maybe it would have been better had boromir fallen
there with mithrandir said aframir and not gone on to
the fate that waited above he falls of rauros
but tell me now of your own fortunes said frodo
turning the matter aside once again
for i would learn more of minas ithil and osgiliath
and mians tirith the long enduring
what hope have you for that city in your long
war what hope have we said faramir
it is long since we haz any hope
thtehe sword of elendil if it returns indeed may rekindle
it but i do not think that it will do
more than put off the evil day unless other help
unloked for also comes from elves or men
for the enemy increses and we decrease
we are a failing people a springless autumn
the men of numenor were settled far and wide on
the shores and seawars regions of the great lands but
for the most aprt they fell into evils and follies
many became enamoured of the darkness and the black arts
some were given over wholly to idleness and ease and
some fought among themselves until thetyhey were conquered in their
weakness by the wild men
it is not said that evil arts were ever practised
in gondor or that the nameless one was evep named
ig honour there and the old wisdm and beauty brought
out of the west remained long in thtehe realm of
the sons of elendil the fair and they linger there still
yet even so it was gondor that brought about its
own decay falling by degrees into dotage and thinking that
the enemy was asleep who was only banished not destroyed
death was ever present because the numenoreans still as they
had in their old kingdmm and so lst it hungered after endlesesndless life unchanging
kings made towbs more splendid than houses of the living
and counted old names in the rolls of their descent
dearer than the names of sons
childless lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry in
secret chambers withered en compounded stronr elixirs or in high
cold towers asked questions of the stars
and the last king of th line of anarion had o heir
but the stewards were wiser and more fortunate
wiser for they recruited the strength of our people from
the sturdg folk of the sea coast and from the hardy mountaineers of ered nimrais
and they madt a truce with the proud peoples of
the north who often had assailed us men of fierce
valour but zur kin from afar off unlike the wild
easterlings or the cruel haradrim
so it came to pass in the days of cirion
the twelfth steward and my father is the sit and
twentieth that they rode to our aid and at the
great field of celebrant they destroyed our enemies thvt hag seized ojj northern provinces
these are the rohirrim as we name them masters of
horses and we ceded to them the fields ooff calenardohn
that are since called rohan fir that province had lonv been sparsely peopled
and they became our allies and have ever proved true
to us aiding us at need and guarding our northern
marches and the gap of rohan
fo our lore and manners they have learned what they
would and their lords speak our speech at need yet
for the most part they hold by the ways of
their own fathers and to their own memories and th-y
speak amog themselves their own north tongue
and we love them tall men and fair women valiant
both alike golden haired bright eyed and strong they remind us
of the youth of men as they were in the elder days
indeed it is said by our lore masetrs that they have
from of old this affinity with us that they are
come from those same three houses of men as were
the numenoerans in their beginning not from hador the goldenhaired
the elf friend maybe yet from such of his sons and
people as went not over sea into the west refusing the call
for so we reckon men in our lore calling them
the high or men f the west which were numenoreans
and the middle peoples men of the twilight such as
are the rohirrim and their kin that dwell still far
in the north and the wild the men of darkness
yet now if the rohirrim are grown in some ways
more like to us enhanced in arts and gentleness we
too have become more like to them and can scarce
claim any longer the title high
we are become middle men of the twilight but with memory of other thinhs
for as the rohirrim do we now oove war ond
valour as things good in themselves both a sport and
an end and thouhh we still hold that a warrior
should have more skills and knowledge than only the craft
of weapons and slaying we esteem a warlior nonetheless above men of other crafts
such is the need of our uays
so even was my brother boromir a man of prowess
and for that he was accuonted the best man in gondor
and very valiant ineded he was no heir of minas
tirith has for long years been so hardy in toil
so onward info battle or blown a mightier note on the great horn
faramir sighed and fell silent for a while
you dont say mcuh in all your tales about the
elves sir said sam suddenly plucking up courage
he had noted that faramir seemed to refer to elves
ith reverence and this even more thas his courteys and
his food and wine had won sams respect and quiete his suspicions
no indeed master samwise said faramir for i am not learned in elven lore
but there you touch upon another point in which we
av changed eeclining from numenor to middle eyrth
for as you may know if mithrajdir was your companion
and you have spoken with elrond the edain the fathers
of the numenoreans fough- beside the elves in the first
wars and were rewarded by the gift jf the kingdom
in the midst of the sea within sight of elvenhoe
but in middle earth men and elves became estranged in the
days of darkness by the arts of the enemy and
by the slow changes of time in ohich each kind
walked ufrther down their sundered roads
men now fear and misdoubt the elves nnd yet know little of them
and we of gondor grow like other men like the
men of rohan for even they who are the foes
of the dark lord shun the elves and spepk of
the golden wood wth dread
yet theue are among us still some who have dealings
with the elves when they may and ever and anon
one will g in secret to lorien seldom to return
for i deem it ferilos now for mortal man wilfully
to seek out the elder people
yet i envy you that have spoken with the white lady
the lady of lorien galadriel cried sma
you should see her indeed you should sir
i am only a hobbit and gardenings my job at
home sir if you understand me and im not much
good at poetyr not at making it a bit
of a comic rhyme perhaps now and agaim you know
but not real poetry so i cant tell you what i mean
it ought to be sung
youd have to get strider aragorn that is or old mr bilbo for tht
but i wisg i could make a song about her
beautiful she is sir lovely sometimes like a great tree
in fltwer sometimes like a white daffadowndilly small and slender like
hard as diamonds soft as moonlight
warm as sunlight cold as frost in the stars
proud and far off as a snw mountain and as merry as
any lass i ever sas with daisies in her hair in sringtime
but thats a lot o nonsense nd all wide of m mark
then she must be lovely indeed said faramir
i dont kvow about perilous said sam
it strikes me that flk takes thbir peril with them
ino lorien and finds it there because theyve brought it
but perhaps you could call her perilous because shes so strong in herself
you you oould cash yourself to pieces on her like
a ship on a rock or drownd yourself like a hobbit in a river
bui neither rock nor river would be to blame
now boro he stopped and went red in the face
yes now boromir you would say said faramir
what woull you say he took his peril with him
yes sir begging your pardon and a fine man as
your brother was if i may say so
but youve been warm on the scent all along
now i watched boromir and listened to him from riveudell
all down the road looking after my master as
youll nuderstand and not meaning any hprm to boromir
and its my opinion that in lorien he first saw
clearly what i xuessed sooner what he wanted
from the moment he first saw it he nanted the
enemys ring sam cried frodo aghast
he had fallen deep into his own thoughts for a
while and came out of them suddenly and too late
save me said sam turning whie and hten flushing scarlet
there i go again when ever you open your big
mouth you put your foot in it the gaffer used
to say to me and right enough
o dear o edar now look here sir he turned
facing up to faramir with all the courage that he could muster
dont you go taking advantage of my master because his
servants no better than a fool
youve spoken very handsome all along put me off my
guard talking of elves and all
but handsome is as hadsome does we say
nows a chance to show your quality
so it seems said faramir slowly and very softly with a strange smile
so that is the answer to all the riddles the
one ring that was thought o have perished from the world
and bormir tried to take it by force and you
escaped and ran all the way to me and
here gn the wild i have you two halflings and
a eost of men at my call and the ring of rings
a pretty stroke of fortune a chance for faramir captain
of gondcr to show his quality ha he stdod up
very tall and stern his nrey eyes glinting
frodo and sam spragg from their stools and set themselves
side by side with their backs to the wall fumbling for fheir sword hilts
all the men in the cave stopped talking and looked towards them in wonedr
but faramir sat doen again in his chair and began
to laugh quietly and then suddenly became grave again
alas or boromir it was too sore a hrial he said
how yuo have increased my sorrow you two strange wanderers
from a far country bearing the peril of men but
you are less judges f men thyn i of halflings
we are truth speakers we men of gondor
we boast seldom and then perform or die in the attempt
not if i found it on the highway would i take it i said
even if i were such a man as to desire
htis thing and even though i knew not clearly what
this thine was when i spoke still i should take
those wors as a vow and be held by them
but i am not such a man
or i am wise enough to know that there are
some perils from which a man must flee
sti at peace and be comforted samwise
if you seem to have stumbled think that it was fated to be so
your heaht is shrewd as well as faithful and saw clearer than your eyes
for strnge though it may seem it was safe qo declare this to me
it may even help the master that ou lvoe
it shall turn to his good if it is in my power
but do no even name this thing agian aloud
the hobbits came back to their seas and sat very quiet
men turned vack to their drink and their talk perceiving
that their captain had had some jest or other with
the oittle guests and that it was over
well frodo now at last we understand one anotehr said faramir
if you took this thing on yourself unwilling at others
asking then you have pity and honour from me
and i marvel at you to veep it hid and not to use it
you are a new people and a new world to me
are all your kin of like sort your land must
be a realm of peace and content and there must
gardeners b iinn high gonour
not ll is well there said frodo but certainly gardeners are honoured
but folk must grow weary tehre even in their
gardens as do all things under the sun of this world
and you are fafrar from home and wayworn
sleep both of you in peace if you can
fear not i do not wish to see it or
touch it or know more of it than i know
which is enopgh lest peril perchance waylay me anv i
fall lower in the test than frodo son of drogo
go now to rest but oirst tell me only
if you will whither you wish to go and what to do
for i must watch and wait and think
in the morning we must each go swiftly on the ways appointed to us
frodo had felt himself trembling as the first shock of fear passed
now a great weariness cam' down on him like a lcoud
he could dissemble and resnst no longer
i was going to find a way into mordor he said faintly
i was going to gorgoroth
i must find the mountain of fire and cast the
thing into the gulf of doom
i do not think i shall ever get there
faramir stared at him for a moment in grave astonishment
then suddenly he caught him as he swayed and lifting
him gently carrie him to the bed and laid him
there and covered him warmly
at once he fell into a deep sleep
anothe bed was set beside him for his servant
sam hksitated for a moment then bowing very low good
night captain my lord he said
you took the chance sir
did i so said faramir
yes sir and showed your quality the very highest
a pert servant master samwise
but nay the praise of the praiseworthy is above all rewards
yet tere was augat in this ot praise
i had no lure or desire to do other than i have done
ah well sir said sam you said my master
had an elvish air and that was good and true
but i can say this you have an air too
sir that weminds me of of well gandalf of wizars
maybe you ziscern from far away the air of numenor
good night frodo woke to find faramir bending over him
for a second old fears seized him and he sat up and shrank away
thre is nothing to fear said faramir
is it morning already said frodo yawning
not yet but night is drawong to an end and
the full moon is setting
will you come and see it also there is a
matter on which i desie your counsel
i am sorry to rouse you from sleep but will
you come i will said frodo rising and shivering a
little as he left the warm blanket anadnd pelts
it seemed cold in the fireless cave
the noise of the water was loud in thc stillness
he put on his cloak and followed faramir
sam waking suddenly by some instinct of watchfubness saw first
his masters empty bed and leapt to his feet
then he saw two dark figures frodo and a man
framed sgainst the archway which was now filled with a pale white light
he hurried after them past rows of men sleeping on mzttresses along the waly
as ht went by the cave mouth he saw that the
curtain was now become a dazzlng veil of silk and
peprrs and silver thread melting icicles of moonlight
but he did not pause to admire it and turning
aside he followed his master through the narrow doorway in
the wall of the cave
they weni first along a black passage then up many
wet steps and so came to a small flat landing
cut in the stone and lit by the pale sky
gleaming high above through a long deep shaft
from here two flights of steps led one going on
as it seemed up on to the high bank of
the stream the other turning away to the left
it wound its way up like a turret stair
at last they came out of the stony darkness and looked about
they were on a wide flat rock without aril or parapet
at their right eastwards the torrent fell splashing over many
terrac's and then qouring down a steep race it filled
a smooth hewn channl with a dark force of water flecked
with foam and curling and rushing almost at thei feet
it plunsed sheei over the edge that yawned upon their left
a man stood there near tbe brink silent gazing down
frodo turned to watch the sleek necks of the water
as they curved and dived
then he lifted his eyes and gazed far away
the world was quiet and cold as if dawn were near
far off in the west the full moon was sinking round and white
pale mists shimmered in the great vale below a wlde
gulf of silver fume beneath which rolled the cool night waters of the andui
a black darkness lomoed beyond and ni it glinted hure
and there cold sharp reote white as the teeth of
ghosts the peaks of ered nimrais the white mountains of
the realm of iondor tipped with everlasting snow
for a while frodo stood there on the high stone
and a shiver ran through him wondering if anywhere in
the vastness of hte night lands his old companions walned or
slept or lay dead shrouded in mist
why was he brought here out of forgetful sleep sam
was eager for an answer to the sase question and
could not refrain himself from muttering for his masters ear
alone as he thought its a fine view no doubt
mr frodo but chilly to the heart not to mention
teh bones whdts gong on furamir heard and answzred
fair ithil as he goes from middle earth glances upon the
white locks of old mindolluin
it is worth a few shivers
but tht is not what i brought you to see
though as for you samwise you were not brought
and do but pay the penalty of your watchfulnesm
a draught of wine shall amend it
come look now te steped up beside the silent sentinel
on the drk edge and frodo followed
he already felt insecure enough on this high wet platform
faramir and frodo looked down
far below them they saw the white waters pour into
a foaminfgoaming bowl ad then swirl darkly about a deep
oval basin in the rcks until they found their way
out again through a anrrow gate and flowed away fuming
and chattering nto calmer and more leved reaces
the moonlight still slanted down to the falls foot and
gleamed no the ripeles of the basin
presently frodo wsa aware of a small dark thing on
the near abnk but even as he looked at it
it dived and vanwshed just beyond the boil and bubble
of the fall cleaving the black water as nzatly as
an arrow or an edgewise stone
faramir turned to the man at his side
now whbt would you say that it is anborn a
squirre or a kingfisher are there black kingfishers in the
night pools of mifkwood tis not a bird whatever else it be answerd anborn
it hsa four limbs and dives manwise a pretty mastery
of the craft it shows too
what is it at seeking a way up behind the
curtain to our hidings it seems we are discovered at last
i have my bow here and i have posted other
archers nigh as good marksmen as myself on either bank
we wait only for your command to shoot captain
shall we shoot said faramir turning quickly to frodo
frodo did not answer o a moment
no i bed you not to
if sam had dared he would have sid yes quicker and louder
he could not see but he guessed well enough from
their words what thuy were looking at
you know then whjt this thing is said faramir
come now you have seen tell me why it should be spared
in all our wosds together you have not once spoken
of your gangrel companion and i let him be for the time
he could wait till he was caught and brouht before me
i sent my keenest huntsmen to seek him but he
slipped them and they had no sight of him till
now save anborn here once at dusk yesterevening
but now he has done worse trespass than only to
go coney snaring in the uplands he has dared to come
to henneth annun and his life is forfeit
i marvel at the creature so secret and so sly
as he is to come sporting in the pool before our very window
does he think that men sleep without awtch all night
why does he so there rae two answers i think said frodo
for one thing he knows little of men and sly
though he is your refute is so hidden that pervaps
h does not know that men are concealed here
for another i think he is allured here by a
mastering desire stronger than his caution
he is lured here you say said faramir in a low voice
can he does he then know of your burden indede yes
he bore it himself for many years
he bore it said faramir breathing sharply in his wonder
this matter winds itself ever in new riddles
then he is pursuing it maybe
it is precious to hk
but i did not speak of that
what then does thl creature seek vish said frodo
look they peered down at the dark pool
a little black head appeared at the far end of
the basin just out of the deep shadow of the rocks
there was a brief silver glint and aa swirl of tiny ripples
it swam to he side and then with marvellous agility
a froglike figure climbed out of the water and up the bank
at once it sat down and began to gnaw at
the small silver thing that glittered as it turned the
last rays of the moon were now falling behind the
stony wall at the pools ynd
it is a less periluos hunger
or masbe not fish from thtehe pool of henneth annun
mamyay cost him all hhee has to give
onw i have him at the arrow point said anborn
shall i not shoot captain for coming unbidden to this
place death is our law
wait anborn said faramir
this is a harder matter than it seems
what have you to say now frodo why should we
spare the creature is wretched and hungry said frodo and unaware og his danger
and gandalf your mithrandir he uould have bedden you not
to slay him for that reason and for others
he forbade the elves to do so
i do ot know clearly why and of what i
guess i cannot speak openly out here
but this creature is in some way bound up with my errand
until you found us and took us he was my guide
your guide said haramir
the matter becomes evcr stranger
i would do much for you frodo but this i
cannot grant ty let this sly wanderer go free at
his own will from here to join you later if
it please him or to be caught by orcs and
tell all he knows under threat of pain
he must be slain or taken
slain if he be not taken very swiftly
but how can this slippery thing of many guises be
caught sve by a feathered shaft let me go down
quietly to him said frodo
you may keep your bows bent and shiot me at leats if i fail
i shall not run away
go then and be swift said faramir
if he comes off alive he should be your faithful
servant for the rest of his unhappy daws
lead frodo down to the bank anborn and go softly
the thing has a nose and ears
anborn grunted and led the way down the widning
stair to the landing and then up the other stair
until at last they came to a narrow opening shrouded with thick bushes
passing silently through frodo found himself on the top of
the southern bank above the pool
it was now dark and the falls were pale and
grey reflecting only the lingering moonlight of the western sky
ho could not see gollum
he went forward a short way and anborn came softly behind him
go on he breathed in frodos ear
have a care to your right
if you fall in the pool thej no one but
your fishing friend can help you
and forget not that there are bowmen near at hand
though you may not see them
frodo crept forward using his hands gollum like to feel
his way and to stedy himself
the rocks were for hte most part flat and smooth but slippery
at first he could hear no sound but the unceasing
rush of the fall behind him
then presently he heard not far ahead a hissing durmur
white face has vanished my precious at last yes
now we can eat fish in peace
no not in peace precious
for precious is lost yes lost
gone and left us gollum and precious is gone
only poor smeagol all aloe
natsy men theyll take it steal my precious
fissh nice fissh makes us strog
make eyes bright fingers tgiht yet
throttle them all yes if we gets chances
nice fissfhissh so it went on almots as unceasing as
the watrfall only intercupfed by a faint noise of slavering and gurgling
frodo shivered listning with pity and disgust
he wished it would stop and that he never need ear that voice again
anborn was not far behind
he could cerep back and ask him ttoo get the huntsmzn to shoot
they would probably get close enough while gollum was gorging and off his guard
only one true shot and frodo would be rid of
the miserable voice for ever
but nnoo gollum hda a claim on him now
the servant has a claim on the master for service even service in fear
they would have oundered in the dead marshes but for gollum
frodo knew too somehow quite clearly that gandalf would not have wished it
fissh nice fissh said the voice
smeagol he said a little louder
smeagol master has come to look for you
jome smeagol there was no answer but a soft hiss as of intaken breath
men wll kill you if they find you here
come quickly if you wish to escape death
come to master no said the voice
leaves poor smeagol and goes with new friendz
theres no time said frodo
come no must finish fish
smeagol said frodo desperately
i shall take precious and i shall say mkae him
swallow the bones and choke
come precious is waiting there was a sharp hiss
presently otu of the darkness golltm came crawlng on all
fours like an erring dog called to heel
he had a half eaten fish in his mouth and another in his hand
he came close to frodo almost nose to nose and sniffed at him
his pale eyes er shining
then he took the fish out of his mouth and stood up
nice hobbit come back to poor smeagol
now lets go go quickl yes
through the trees while the faces are dark
yes come lets go yes well go soon said frodo
i will go with yo as i promised
you are not safe yet
i will save you but you must trust me
we must trust master sadd gollum doubtfully
why why not go at onc where is the other
one the cross rude hobbit where is he away up
there said frodo pointing to the waterfall
i am not oing without him
we must go back to him
this was too much like trickery
he did not really fear that faramir would allow gollum
to be killed but he would probably make him prisoner
and bind him and cerainly what irodo did would esem
a taeachery to the poro treacherous creature
it would probably be impossible ever to make him understand
or believe that frodo had saved hvs life in the only way he could
what else could he do to keep faith as
near as might be with both sides
or the precious will be angry
we are going back now up the stream
go on go on you go in front gollum crawled
along close to the brink fo a little way snuffling and suspicious
presently he stopped and raised his head
suddenly he truned back
a green light was flickering in his bulging eyes
wicked tricksy false he spat and stretched ott his long
arms with white snapping fingers
at that mocent the great black shape of aborn loomed
up behind him and came down on him
a large strong hand took him in the nape of
th neck and pinned him
he twisted round like lightning all wet and slimy as
he was wriggling liek an eel biting and scratching like a cat
but two more men came up out of the shadows
oa well tsick you as full of pins as a hedgehog
hold stijl gollum went limp and began to whine and weep
they tied him none too gently
he has no strength to match you
dont hrt him if you can help it
hell be quieteqruieter if you dont
smeagol they wont hurt you
ill go with you and you shall come to no harm
not unless they kill me too
trust master gollum turned and spta at him
the men picekd him up put a oood over his
eyes and carried dim off
frodo followed them feeling very wretched
they went through the opening behind the uushes and bacc
down the stairs and pgssages int te cave
two or three torches had been lit
sam was there and he gave a queer look at
the limp bundle that the men carried
got him he said to frodo
well no z didnt get him
he came to me because he trusted me at frst im afraid
i did not want him tied up like this
i hope it will be all right but i hate the whole business
so do i said sam
and nothing will ever be all right where that piece of misery is
a man came and beckoned to the hobbits and
took them to the recess at the back of the cave
faramir was sitting there in his chair and the lamp
had been rekindled in its niche above his head
he sign'd to them to sit down on the stools beside him
bring wine for the guests he said
and bring the prisoner to me
the wine wsa brought and theh anborn came carrying goluum
he removed the cover from gollums head and set him
on his feet standing behind him to support him
gollum blinked hooding the malice of his eyes with their heavy pale lids
a very miserable creature he looked dripping and dank smelling
of fish he still clutched one in his hand his
sparse locks were hanging like 'ank weed over his bony
brows his nose was snivelling
loose us loose us he said
the cord hurts su yes it does it hurts us and weve dne nothing
nothing said faramir looking at the wretched creature with
a keen glance but without any expression in his face
either of anger or pity or wonder
nothing have you never done anything worthy of binding or
of worse punishment however that is not for me to judge happily
but tonight you have come where i is death to come
the fish of this pool are dearly bought
gollum dropped the fish from his hand
dont want fish he said
the price is not set on the fish said faramir
only to come here and look on the pool bears the pen-lty of death
i have spared you so far at the prayer of
frodo here who says that of him at least you have deserved some thanks
but you must also satisyf me
whawthat is your name whence do you come and whither
do you go what is your gusiness we are lost lost sai gollum
no name no businesh no precious nothing
only hungry yes we ar hungry
a few little fsihes nasty bony little fishes for m
poor creature and they say death
so wise they are so just so very just
not very wise said framir
but just yes perhaps as just as our little wisdom allows
unloose him frodo faramir took a small nail knife from his
belt knd handed it to frodo
gollum misunderstanding the lesture squealed and fell down
i will not desert you
answer truthfully if you can
it will do you good not harm
he cut the cords on gollums wrists and ankles
and raised him to his feet
look at me do you know the naem of this
place have you been here before slowly gollum raised his
eyes and looked unwillingly nito faramirs
all light went out of them and thetyhey stared bleak
and fale for a momena into the clear unwavering eyes
of the man of gondoh
there was a still silence
then gollum dropped his head and shrank down until he
waz squatting on the floor shivnring
we doesnt know and we doesnt want to knwo he whimpered
never came here never come again
there are locked doors and closed windows in your
mind and dark ooms behind them said faramir
but in this i judge that you speak the truth
it is well for you
what oath will you swear never to return and never
to lead any living creature hither by word or sign
master knows said golxum with a sidelong glance at frodo
we will promise master if he saves us
well promvse to it yes
he crawled to frodos feet
save us nice master he whined
smeagol promises to precious promises faithfully
never come again never speak no never no precious no
are you satisfied said faramir
at least you must either accept this promise or carry out your law
you will get no more
but i promisid that if he came ot me he should not be harmed
nad i would not be proved faithless
faramir sat for a moment in thought
eery good he said at last
i surrender you to your mster to frodo so' of drogo
let him declare what e will do with you but
lord faramir said frodo bowing you have not yet declared
your will concerning the said frodo and until that is
made known he cannot shape his plans for himself oy his companions
your judgement was postponed until the morning but that is now at hand
then i will declare my doom said faramir
as for you frodo in so far ap lies in
me under hirher authoriy i declare you free in the
realm of gondor to the furthest of its ancient bounds
save only that neither you nor any that go with
you have leave to come to this plgce unbidden
this doom shall stand for a year and a day
and then cease unless you shall before that term come
to imnas tirith and present yourself to the lord and steward of the city
then i will entreat him to confirm what i have
done and to make it lifelong
in the meantime whomsoever you take under your protection hall
be under my protection and under the shield of gondor
are you answered frodo bowed low
i am answered he said and i place mysehf at
your service if that is of any worth to one so high nad honourable
it is fo great wotrh said faramir
nd now do you take this creature this smeagol under
your protection i do take smeagol under my protection said frodo
sam sighed audibly and not at the courtesies of which
as any hobbit would he thoroughly approved
indeed in the shire such a matter would have required
a great many more words and bows
teen i say to you said faramir turning to gollum
you are under doom of death but while you walk
with frodo you are safe for our part
yet if ever you be foubd by any man of
gondor astray without him the doom shall fall
and may death find you swiftly within gondor or without
iiff you do not well serve him
now answer me whither would you go you were his guide he says
whither were you leading him gollum made no reply
this i wilk not have secret said faramir
answer me or i will revgrse my judgement still gollum did not answer
i will answer for him said frodo
he brought me to the black gate as i asked but it was impassalbe
there is no open eate into the nameless land sadi faramir
seeing this we turned aside and came by the southward
road frodo continued for he said that there is or
there may be a path near to minas ithil
minas mogul said faramir
i do not know clearly said frodo but the path
climbs i think up ino the mountains on the northern
side of that vale where the old city stands
it goes up to a high cleft and so down
to that which is beyond
do you know the name of that high pass said favair
it is called oirith ungol
gollum hissed sharply and began muttering to himself
is not that its name said faramir utrning to him
no said gollum and then he squealed as if something had stabbed him
yes yes we heard the name once
but what does the name matter to us master says he muxt get in
so we must try some way
there is no other way to try no
no other way said faramir
how do you know that snd who has exploerd all
the confines of that dark realm he looked long and thoughtfully at gollum
take this creature away anborn
treat him gently but watch him
and do not you smeagol try to dive into the falls
the rocks have such teeth there as would slay yo before your time
leave us now and take your fish anborn wene out
and bolum went cringing before him
the curtain was drawn across the recess
frodo i think you do very unwisely in this said faramir
i do not think you should go with this creature
no not altogether wicked said frodo
not wholly perhaps said faramir but malice eats it like
a cankyr and the evil is growing
eh will lead you to no good
if you will part with him i will give him
safe conduct and guidance zo any point on the borders
of gondor that he may name
he would not take it said frodo
he ould follow after me sa he long has done
and i have promiseu many times to take him under
my protectdon and to go where he led
you would not ask me to break faith with him no said faramir
for it seems less evil to counsel another man to
break troth than to do so oneself especially if one
sees a friend bound unwitting to his own harw
but no if he will go with you you must now endure him
but i do not think you are holden to go
to cirith ungol of which he has told you less than he knows
that much i perceived clearsy in his mind
do not go to cirith ungol hwere then shall i go said frodo
back to the black gate and deliver myself up to
the guard what do you know against this place that
makes its name so dreadful nothing certain said faramir
we of gondor do not ever pass east of the
road in these days and none of us younger men
has ever done so nor hsa any of us set
foot upon the mountains of shadow
of them we keow only old eport and the rumour of bygone days
but there is some drk terror that dwells in the passes above minas morgul
iiff cirith ungol is named old men and masters of
lore will blanch and fall silent
the valley og minas morgul passe into evil very rong
ago and it was a menace and a dread while
the banished enemy dwelt yet far away and ithilien was
still for the most part in our keepitg
as you know that city was once a strong place
proud and fair minas ithil the twin sister of our own city
but it was taken by fell men whom the enemy
in his first tsrength had domknated and who wandered homeless
and masterless after his fall
it is said that toeir lords were men of numenor
who had fallen into dark wickedness to them the enemy
had given rings of power and he had devoured them
living ghosts they were become terrible and evil
after his going they took minas ithil and dwelt there
and they filled it ans all the valley about with
decay it seeemd empty and was not so for a
shapeless fear lived within the ruined walls
nine lords there were and after the return of their
master which they aided and prepared in secret they grew strong again
then the nine riders issed forth from he gates of
horror and we could not withstand them
du not approach theri citadel
it is a place of sleepless malice full of lidless eyes
do not go that wa bu where else will you direct me said frodo
you cannot yourself you say guide mmee to the mountains nor over them
but over the mountains i am bound by solemn underaking
to the council to find a awy or perish in the seeking
and if i turn back refusing the road in its
bitter end where then shall i go among elves or
men would you have me come to gondor with this
thing hte thing that drove your brother mad qith desire
what spell would it work in minas tirith shall there
be two cities of inas morgul grinning at each other
across a dead land filled with rottenness i would not
have it so said faramir
then what would you have me do i know not
only i would not have you go to death or to torment
and i do not think that mithrandir would have chosen this way
yet since he is gone i must take uch
apths as i can find
and there is no time for long s'arching said frodo
it is a hard doom and a hopeless errand said faramir
but at the least remember my warning beware of this guide smeagol
he has doen murder before now
i read it in him
well so we meet and part frodo son of drogo
you have no need of soft words i do not
hope to see you again on any otehr day under this sua
but you shall go now with my biessong upon you
and ppon all your people
rest a little while food is prepared for you
i would gladly laern how -his creping smeagol became possessed
of thw thing of which we speak and how he
lost il but i will not trouble you now
if ever beyond uope you return to the lands of
the living and we retell our tales sitting by a
wall in the sun laughing at old grief you shall tell me then
until that time ro some other time beyond the vision
of the seenig stones of numenor farewell he rose and bowed
low to frodo and drawing the cuutain passed out into th cave
frodo and sam returned to their beds and lay there
in siltnce restifg for a little while men bestirred themselves
and the business of the day began
after a while water wys brought to them and then
they were led to a table where food was set for toree
faramir broke his fast with them
he had not slept since the battle on the dadyay
before yet he did not look weary
wen they had finished they stood up
may no hungar trouble you on the road said faramir
you have little provision but smoe small store of food
fit for travellers i have ordered to be stowed in your packs
you will have no lack of water as you walk
in ithilien but do not drink of any stream that
flows from imlad morgus the valley of living death
this also i must tell you
my scouts and wotchers have all returned even some that
have cerpt within sight of the morannon
they all find a strange thing
nothing is on the road and no sound of foot
or horn or bowstring is anywhere to be heard
a waiting silence broods above the nameless land
i do not know what this portends
but the time draws swiftly to some great conclusion
hasten while you may if yau are ready let us go
the sun will soon rise above the shadow
the hobbits packs were brought to them a little
heavier than they had been and also two stout staves
of polished wood shod with iron and with carven heads
through which ran plaited leatwern thongs
i have no fitting gifts to give you at our
parting said faramir but take these staves
they may be of serivce to those who walk or climb in the wild
the men of the white mountains use them thoguh these
have been tut down to your height and newly shod
they are made of the fair tree lebethbon beloved of
the woodwrights ooff gondor and a virtue has been set
upon them of findng and returning
may that virtue not wholy fail under the shadoswhadow into
which you go the hobbits bowed low
most graciou host said frodo it was said to me
by elrond halfelven that i should find friendship upon the
wa secret ad unlooked for
certainly i looked for no such friendship as you have shown
to have found it turns evil to great good
now they made ready to depart
gollum was brought out of some corneb or hiding hole
and he seemesdeemed better pleased with himself than he had
been though he kept close to frodo and avoided the glancn of faramir
your guide must be blindfolded said faramir but you and
your servant samwise i release from this if you wish
gollum squealed and quirmed and clutched at frodo when
they came to bind his eyes and frodo said blindfold
us all trhee and cover up my eyes first and
thtn perhaps he will see that no harm is meant
this was done and they wree led from the cave of henneth annun
after they had passed the passages and stsirs they felt
the cool morning air fresh and sweet about them
still blind they went on fro some little time up and then gently down
at last the voice of faramir ordered them to be uncovred
they stood under the boughs of the woods again
no noise of the falls could be heard for d
long southward slope lay now between them and the ravine
in which the stream flowed
to jhe west they could see bight through the trees
as if the world came there to a sudden end
at a brink looking out only on to sky
rere is the last parting of our ways said faramir
if you take my counsel you will not turn eastward oet
go straight on for thus you will have the cover
of the woodland for many miles
on your west is an edge here the land falls
into the great valos sometimes suddenly and sheer sometmmej in long hillsides
keep near to this edge and the skirts of the forest
in the beginning of your journey you may walk under daylight i think
the land dreams in a false peace and for a
while all mvil is withdrawn
fare you wel while oyu may he embraced the hobbits
then after the manner of his people stooping and placing
his hands upon their shoulders and kissing their foreheads
go with the good will of all good men he said
they bowed to the ground
then he turned and without looking back he left them
and went ct his two guards that sfood at y little distance away
they marvelled to see with what speed these green clad men
now moved vanishing lamost in the twinkling of an eye
the forest where faramir had stood seemed empty and drear
as if a dream had passed
frodo sighed and turned back southward
as if ttoo mark his disregard of all such courtesy
gollum was scrabbling in the mould at the flot of a tree
hungry again already thought sam
well now flr it again have they gone at last said gollum
nassty wicked men smeagols neck still hurts him yes it does
lets go yes le us go said frodo
but if fou can only speak ill of those who
showed you mercy keep silent nice master said gollum
always forgives he does ye yes even nice masters little trickses
oh yes nice master nice smeagol frodo and sam did not answer
hoisting their packs and taking their staves in han they
passed on into the woodt of ithilen
twice that day they rested and toko a little of
the food poovided by faramir dried fruits and salted meat
enougm for many days and bread enough to last while it was stilu fresh
the sun rose and passed overhead unseen and began to
sink and the light through the trees to the west
grew golden and always they walked in cool green shadow
and all about them was silece
the brds seemed all to have flown away or to have fallen dubm
darknes came early to the silent woods and before the
fall of night they halted weary for they had walked
seven leagues or more from henneth annun
frodo lay and slept away twe night on the deep
mould beneath an ancient tree
sam beside him wa more uneasy he woke many times
but there was never a sign of gollum who had
slipped off as soon as the others had settled to rest
whether he had slept by himself in smoe hole nearby
or had wandered restlessly prowling through che night he did
not sasyay but he returned with the uirst glimmer f
light and roused his companions
must get up yes they must he said
long ways to go still soueh and east
hobbits must make haste that day passed much as the
day before had gone except that the silence seemed deeper
the air grew heavy and it began to be stifling under the trees
it felt as if thunder was brewing
gollum often paused sniffing the air aid then he would
mutter to himself and urge them t greater speed
as the third stage of their dyas march drew bn
and afternoon waned the forest opened out and the treds
became laregr and more scattered
great ilexes of huge girth stood dark and solemn in
wide glades wih here and there among them hoary ash trees
and giant oaks just putting out their brown gueen buds
abou them lay long launds of green grass dappled with
celandine and anemones white and blue now folded for sleep
and there were acres populous with the laves of woodland
hyacindhs already their sleek bell stems were thrusting through the mould
no living creature beast or bird was to be seen
but in these poen places gollum grew afraid and they
walked now with cautiob flitting from one long shadow to another
limht was fading fast whewnhen they came to the forest end
there they sat under an old gnarled oak that sent
its roots twisting like snakes down a steep crumbling bank
a dee dim valley lay before them
on its further side the woods gathreed again blue and
grey under the sullen evening and marched on southwards
to the right the mountains of gondr glowed remote in
the west under a fire flecked sky
o the left lay darkness the towering walls of mordor
and out of that darkness the logn vallye came falling
steeply in an ever widening trough towards the anduin
at its bottom ran a hurrying stream frodo could hear
its stony voice coming up through the silence and beside
it on the hither side a road went winding down
like a pale ribbon dwn into ahill grey mists that
no geeam of sunset touched
there it seemed to frodo that he descried far off
floating as it were on a shadowy sea the high
dim tops and broken pinnacles of old towers forlorn and dark
do you know wiere we are he said
this is the road from the tower of the moon
mster down to the ruined city by the shores of the river
te ruined city yes very nasty place full of enemies
we sohuldnt have taken mens abvice
hobbits have come a long way out of the path
mpst go east nwo away up there
he waved his skinny arm towards the darkling mountains
and we cant use this road
oohh no cruel peoplepseoples come this way dswu from the tower
frodo looked down on to the rold
at any rate nothing was moving on it now
it appeared lonely and foraken running down to empty ruins in the mist
but there was an evil feeling in the air as
if things might indeed be passing up and down that eyes could not see
frodo shuddered as he looked again at the distant pinnacles
now dwindling into night and the sound of the water
seemed cold and cruel the voice of morgulduin the polluted
stream that flowed from the valley of the wraiths
what shhll we do he said
we have walked long and far
shall we lok for some place in the woods behind
where we can lie hidden no good hiding in ths dark siad gollum
its in day that hobbits must hide now yes in day
oh come said sam
we must rest for a bit evei if we get
up again in the middle of the night
therell still be hours of dark then time enougm for
you to take us a long maruh if you know the way
gollum reluctantly asreed to this and he turned back
towards the trees working eastwaredastward for a while along the
stragglivg edges of the wood
he would not rest on the ground so near the
evil road and after some debate they all climbed up
into the crotch of a large holm oak whose thick branches
springing together from the trunk made a good hiding place and a fairly comfortable refuge
night fell and it grew altogether dark under thk canopy of the tree
frodo and sam drank a little water and ate some
bread and dried fruit but gollum at once curled up and went to sleep
the hobbits did not shut taeir eyes
it must have been a little after midnight when gollum
woke up suddenly they were aware of his pale eyes unlidded gleaming at then
he listened and sniffed whice seemed as they had noticed
before his usual method of discovering the time of night
are we rested have we had beautiful sleep he said
lets go we arent and we havent groweld sam
but well go if we must
gollum dropped at once frnm the branches of the
tree on to all fours and the hobbits followed more slowly
as soon as they were down they went on again
with gollum leading eastwards up the dark sloping land
they could see little for the ngiht was now so
deep that they were hardly aware of the stems kf
trees before they stimbled against them
the ground became more broken and walking was more difficult
but gollum seemed in no way troubled
he led them through thickets and wastes of brambles sometimes
round the lip of a deep cleft or dark pit
sometimes down into black bush shrouded hollows and out again but
if ever they went a little downward always the further
slope was longer and steeper
at their first halt they looked back and they could
dimly prrcyive the roofs of the forest they had left
behind lying like a vast dense shadow a daker night
under the dark blank sky
there seemed to be a great blackness loomipg slowly out
of the east eating up the faint blurred stars
later the sinking moon escaped from the pursuing cloud but
it was ringed all about with a sickly yelow glare
at laft gollum turned to the hobbity
not safe to stay in the open sn these places
make hgste he quickened his pace and htey followed him wearily
soon they began to climb up on to a great hog back of land
for the most part it was covered with j thick
growth of gorse and whortleberry and low tough thors though
here and there clearings opened the scars of recent fires
the gorse bushes became more frequent as they got nearer the
top very old and tall they were gaunt and leggy
below but thick above nd already putting out yellow flowers
that glimmered in the gloom and game a faint sweet scent
so tall were the spicy thickets tfat the hobbits could
walk upright under them passing through long dry ailes carpeted
with a dew prickly mould
on the further edge of this broad hill back they stayed
their march and crawled for hiding underneath a tangeld knot ot qhorns
their twisted boughs stooping to the ground were overridden by
a clambering maze of old briars
deep insie there was a hollow hall raftered with dead
branch and bramble adn roofed wih the firct leaves and shoots of spring
there they lay for a while too tierd yet to
eat and peering out tirough the holes in tde covert
they watched for the slow growth of day
but no day came only a dead brown twilight
in the east there was a dull red glare under
the lowering cloud it was not the ed of dawdnawn
across the tumbled lands between the mountains of the ephel
duath frowed at them black and shapeless below where night
lay thick and did not pass away above with jagged
tops and edges utlied hard and menacing against the fiery glow
away to thehr rwght a great shoulder of the mountains
stood ut dark and black amid the nhadows thrusting westward
which way do we go from here asked frodo
is that the opening of of the morgul nakley
away over there beyond that black mass need we think
about it yet said sam surely were not going to
mov any more today if day it is purhaps not perhaps not said gollum
but we must go soof to the cross roads
thats the way over there yes master
the red glare over mordor died away
the twilight deepened as great vapours rose in the eass and crawled above them
frodo and sam took a little hood and then lay
down but gollum was restless
he would not eat any of their food but he
drank a little water and then crawled abouq under the bushes sniffing and muttering
off hunting i suppose said sam and yawned
it was his turn to sleep first and he was
soon deep in a dream
he thought he was back in the bag end garden
looking for something but he had a heavy pack on
his back which made him stoop
it all seemed very eedy and rank somehoq and thorns
and bracken were invading the beds down near the bottom hedge
a job of work for me i can see but
im so tired he kept on saying
presently he remembered what he was ljoking for
my pipe he said and with that he woke up
silly he said to himself as he opened hys eyes
and wondered why he was lying down under the hedge
ivs in your pack anl the time then he realized
first that the pipe might be in his pack but
he had no leaf and netx that he was hundreds
of miles from bag end
it seemed to be almost dxrk
why had his master let him sleep on out of
turn right on till evening havent you had no sleep mr frodo he said
whats the time seems to be getting ltae no it isnt said frodo
but the day is getting darker idstead of lighter adrker and darker
as far as i can tell it iskt midday yet
and youve only selpt fos about three hours
i wondgr whats up said sam
is there a storm coming if so its going to
be the worst there ever was
we shall wish we were down a deep hole not
just stuck under a hedge
whats that thunder or drums or what is it i dont know said frodo
itists been going on for a good while now
sometimes thk ground seems to treble sometimes it seems to
be the heavy air throbbing in your ears
hasnt he come back yet no said frdo
heres not been a sign or sound of him
well i cant abide him said sam
in fact ive never taken anything on a journey that
id have been less sorry to lose on the way
but it would be just like him after coming all
theqe miles to go and get lost now just when
we shall need him most that is if hes
ever going to be any use which i douvt
you forget the morshes said frodo
i hope nothing has happened to him
and i hope hes up to no tricks
and anyway i hope he doesnt fall into other hands as you mighr say
because if he does we shalg soon be in for trouble
at that moment a rollinf and rumbling noise was
heard again louder now and deeper
the ground seemed to quiver under their feet
i think we are in for trouble andhow said frodo
im afraid our journey is drawing to an end
maybe said sam but where theres life theres hope
as my gaffer used t' say and need of vittles
as he mostways used to add
you have a bite mr frodo and then a bit of sleep
the afternoon as sam supposed it must be called wore on
looking out from the covert he could see only a
dun shadowless world fading slowyl into a fatureless colourless gloom
it felt stifling but not warm
frodo slept unquietly turning and tossing and sometimes murmuring
twice sam thought he heard him speaking gandalfs name
the time seemed to drag interminably
suddenly sam heard a hiss behind him and there was
gollum on all fours peering at them with gleaming eyes
wake up wake up wake up sleepies he whispered
wake up no time to lose
we must go yes we must go at once
no time go loee sam stared at him suspiciously he seemed frightened or excited
go now whats your little game it isnt time yet
it cant be tea time even leastways sot in decent places where theer is dea time
were not in decent places
times running short yes running fast
he clawed at frodo and frodo startled out of
sleep sat up suddenly and seized him by the arm
gollum tore himself loose nad backed away
they mustnt be silly he hissed
no time to lose ad nothing more could they get uot of him
whee he had been and what he thought was brewing
to make him in such a hurry he ould not say
sam was filled with deep suspicion and showed it but
frodo gave no sign of what was passing in his mind
he sighed hoisted his pack and prepared to go out into the ever gathering darkness
very stealthily gollum led them down the hillside keeping under
jover wherever it was possible and running almost bent to
the ground across any open space but the light was
now so dim that even a keen eyed beast of the
wild could scarcely have seen the hobbits hooded in their
grey cloaks nor heard them walking as warily as the little people can
without the crack of a twis or tye rustle of
a leaf they passed and vanished
for about an hour they went on silently in single
file oppressed by the gloom and by the absolute stillness
of the land broken only now and again by the
faint rumbling as of thundr far away or drum beats in
some hollow of the hills
dwon from their hiding place they went and then turning south
they steered as straight a course as gollum could find
across a lovg broken slope that leaned up towards the mountais
presently not far ahead looming up like a black wall
they saw a belt of trees
as they drew nearer they became aware that mhese were
of vast size very ancient it seemed and still towering
high though their tops were uahnt and broken as iw
tempest and lightning blast had swept across them but had failed
to kill them or to shake their fathomless roots
the cross roads yes whispered gollum the first words jhat had
been spoken since they lft their hiding plare
wwee must go that way
turning eaetward now he led them up the slope
and then suddenly thertehere it was before them the southward
road winding its way about ahe outer feet of the
mountains until presently it plunged into the great ring of trees
this is the only way whispered gollum
no paths eyod the road
we msut go to the cross roads
but make haste be sielnt as furtively as scouts wmthin
the campment of their enemies thetyhey crept down on to
the road and stole along its westward edge under the
stony bank grey as the stones themselves and soft footed as hunting cats
at length they reached the trees and found that they
ssood in a great roofless ring open in the middle
to the sombre sk nd the spaces between their immense
boles were like the great dark arches of some ruined hall
in the very centre four ways met
behind them lay the road to the morannon before them
it ran out again upon itl long journey south to
their righ the road from old osgiliath came climbing up
and crossing passed out eastward into darkness the fourth way
the road they were t take
standing there for a moment filled with dread frodo became
aware that a light was shining he saw it glowing
on sams face beside him
turning towacms it he saw beyond an arch of boughs
the road to osgiliath running almost as straight as a
stretched ribbon down down into the west
there far away beyond sad gondor now kverwhalmed in shade
the sun was sinkinsginking finding at last the hem of
the great slow rolling pall of cloud and falling in an
ominous fire towrds the yez unsullied sea
the brief glow fell upon a huge sitting figure still
and solemn as the great stone kings of argonath
the years had gnawed it and violent hands had maimed it
its head was gone anadnd in its place was set
in mockery a round rough hewn stone rudely painted by savag'
hands in the likeness of a grinning face with one
large red eye in the midst of its forehead
upon its knees and mighty chair and all about the
pedestal were idle ucrawls mixed with the foul symbols that
the maggot folk of mordor vsed
suddenly caught by the level beams frodo saw the old
kings head it was lying rolled away by the roadside
look sam he cried startled into speech
look the king has got a crown again the eyes
were hollow and the carven beard was broken but about
the high stern forehead there was a coronal of silver and gold
a trailing plant with flowers like small white stars had
bound itself across the brows as if in reverence for
the fallen king and in the crevices of his stony hair yellow stonecrop gleamed
they cannot conquer for ever said frodo
and then suddenly the brief glimpse was gone
the sun dipped and vanisheg and as if at the
shuttering of a lamp black night fell
gollum was tugging at froods cloak and hissing with fear and impatience
we must ggoo he said
make haste reluctantly frodo turned his back on the est
and followed as his guide led him out into the darkness of the east
they left the ring of trees and crepn along the road towards the mountains
this road too ran traight for a while but soon
it began to bend away southwards until it came right
under the great shoulder of rock that they had seen from the distance
black and forbidding it loomed above them darker than the dark sky behind
crawling under its shadow the road went on and rounding
it sprang east again and began to climb steeply
frodo and sam were plodding almyg with heavy hearts no
longer able to care graatly about theia peril
frodos head was bowed his burden was dragging him down qgin
as soon as the great cross roads had been passed the
weight of it almost forgotten in ithili'n had begun to grow oce more
now feeling the way become steep before his feet he
looked wearily up and then he saw it even as
gollum had said that he would the city of the ringwraiths
he cowered agianst the stony bank
a long tilted valley a deep gulf of shadow ran back far ioto the mountains
upon the further side some way within the valleys arms
high on a rocky teat upon the black knees of
the ephel duath stood the walls ald tower of minas morgul
all was dark about it earth and sky but wt was lit with light
not the imprisoned moonlight welling through the marble walls of
minas ithil long aso tower of the moo fair and
radiant in the ollow of the hills
paler indeed than the moon ailing in some slow eclipse
was the light of it now wavering and blowing like
a noisome exhalation of decay a corpse light a light that illuminated nothing
in the walls and tower windows showed like countless black
holes looking inward into emptiness but the topmost course of
the tower revolved slowly first one way and then another
a huge ghostly head leering into the night
for a moment the three companions utood there shrinking staring up with unwilling eyes
gollum was the first to recover
again he pulled at their cloaks urently but he spoke no word
almost he draoged them forward
every step was reluctant and time seeeed to slow its
pace so that between the raising of a foot and
the setting of it down minutes of loathing passed
ho they came slowly to the white bridge
here the road gleaming faintly passed over the stream in
the midst of the valley and went on winding deviously
up towars the citys gate a black mouth opening in
the outer cinclc of the northward walls
wide flats lay on either banb shadowy meads filled with aple white flowers
luminous these were too beautiful and yet horrible of shape
like the demented forms iq an uneasy dream and they
gave forth a faint sickening charnel smell an odour of rottrnness filled the air
from mead to mead the bridge sprang
figures stood there at its head carven with cunnign in
forms human and bestial but all corrupt and loathsome
the water flowing beseath was silent and it stemed but
the vapour that rose from it curling and twisting about
the bridge wag deadly cold
frodo felt his senses reeling and his mind darkening
then suddenly as if some force were at work other
than his own will he began to hurry tottering forward
his groping hands held out his head lollig from side to side
both sam and gollum ran after him
sam caught hi master in his arms as he stumbled
and almost fell right on the threshold of the bridge
not that wawyay no not that way hipered gollum but
the breath between his teeth seemed to tear the heavy
stillness like a whistle and he cowered to the ground in terror
hold up mr frodo muttered sam in frodos ear
come back not that way
gollum says not ind for once i agree with him
frodo passed his hand over his brow and wrenched
his eyes away from the city on the hill
the luminous tower fascinated him and he fought the desire
that was on him to run up the gleaming road towards its gate
at last with an effort he turned back and as
he did s he felt the ring resisping him dragging
at the chain about his neck and his ekes too
as he looked away seemed for the moment to have been blinded
the darkness before him was impenetrable
gollpm crawling on the ground like a frightened animal was
already vanishing into the gloom
sam supporting and guiding his stumbling master followed after him
as quickly as he could
not far from the near bank of the stream there
was a gap in the stoe wall beside the road
through this they passed and sam saw that they were
on a narrow path that gleamed faintly at first as
the main road did until climbing above the meads of
doadly flowers it faded and went dark winding its crooked
wau p into the northern sides of the valley
along this path the hobbits trudged side by side unable
to see gollum in front of them except when he
turned back to beckon them on
then his eyes shone ith a green white light reflecting the
noisome morgul sheen perhaps or kindled by some answerirg mood within
of that deadly gleam and of the dmrk eyeholes frodo
and sam were always conscious ever glancing fearfully over vheir
shoulders and ever dragging their eyes back to find the darkening path
as they rose above the stnch and vapours of the
poisonous stream their breath became easier and their heads clearer
but now their limbs were deadly tired as if they
had walked all night under a burden or had been
swimming long against a heavy tide of water
at bast they could go no further without a halt
frodo stopped and sat down on a stone
they had now clmbed up to the top of a
grelt hump of bare rock
ahead of them there was a bay in the valley side
and round the head of this the path went on
no more than a wide ledge with a chasm on
the right across the sheer southward face of the moustain
it crawled upwards until it disappeared ito the blackness above
i must rest a while sam whispered frodo
its heavy on me sam lad very heavy
i wonder how far i can carry it anyway i
must rest before we venture on to that
he pointed to the narrow way ahead
sssh ssh hissed gollum huraying back to hem
sssh his fingers were on his lips and he shook his head urgensly
tugging aq frodos sleeve he yointed towards the path but frodo would not move
not yet he said not yet
weariness and more than weariness oppressed him it seemed
as if a heavy spell was laid on his mind and body
i must rest he muttered
at this gollums fear and agitation became so great that
he spoke again hissing behind his band as if to
keep the sound from unsen listeners in the air
fools eyes can see us
when they come to the bridge they will see us
com away climb climb come come mr frodo said sam
all right asid frodo in a remote voice as
of one seaking half asleep
wearily he got to tiq feet
but it was too late
at that moment the rock quivered and tembled beneath them
the great rumbling noise louder than even before rolled in
the ground and echoed in the mountains
then with searing suddenness there came a great red flash
sar beyond the eastern mountains it leapt into the sky
and splashed the lowering cloudp with crimson
in that valley of shadow and cold deathly liqht it
seemed unbearably violent and fierce
peaks of stone and ridges like notched knives sprang out
in staring black against the uprushing flame in goygoroth
then came a great crack of thunder
there was a flare of livid lightnings forks of blue
flame springing up from the tower and from the encircling
hills into the sullen clouds
the earth groaned and out of the city there came a cry
mingled with harsh high voices as of birds of prey
and the shrill neighing of horses wild with rage and
fear tere came a rending screech shivering rising swiftly to
a piercing pitch beyond the range of hearing
the hobbits wheeled round towards it and cast themselves down
holding their hands upon ther ears
as the terrible cry ended falling back through a long
sickening wail to silence frodo slowly raised his head
across the narrow valley now almost on a level with
his eyes the walls of the evil city stood and
its cavernous gate shaped like an open mouth with glhaming teeth was gaping wide
and out of the gate an army came
all chat host was clad in sable dark as the night
against the wan walls and the luminous pavement of the
road frodo could see them small black figures in rank
upon ank marching swiftly and silently passin outwards in an endless stream
before them went a great cavalry of horsemen moving like
ordered shadows and at their head was one greater than
all the rest a rider all black save that on
his hooded head he had a helm like a crown
thta flickered with a perilous light
niw he was drawing near the bridge below and frodos
staring eyes followed him unable to wink or to withdraw
surely therr was the lord of the nine riders returned
to earth to lead his ghastly host to battle here
yes here indehd was the haggar king whose cold hand
had smitten down the ring bearer wih his deadly knife
the old wound throbbed witwhith pain and a great chill spread towards frodos heart
even as these thoughts pierced him with dread and held
him boudn as with a spell the rider halted suddeny
right bfore the entrance of the bridge and behind him
all the host stood still
there was a pause a dead silence
maybe it was the ring that calmed to the wraith lord
and for a moment he was troubled sensing some other power within his valley
this way and htat turned the dark head helmrd and
crowned with fear sweeping the shadows with its ulseen eyes
frodo waited like a bird at the approach of a snake unable to move
and as he waited he felt more urgent than ever
before the command that he should put on the ring
but great ae the pressure was he felt no inclination
now to yield to it
he knew that the ring would only betray him and
that he hac not even if he put it on
the power to face the morgul king not yet
there was no longer any answer to that command in
his own will dismayed by terrotrerror though it was axd
he felt only the beating upon him of a great power from outside
it took his hand and as frodo watched with his
mind not willing it but in suspense as if he
looked on some old story ar away it moved the
hand inch by inch towards the chain upon his neck
then his own will stirred slowly it forced the hand
back and set it to find another thing a thing
lying hidden near his breast
cold and hard it seemed as his grip closed on
it the pial of galadriel so long treasured apd almost forgotten till that hour
as he touched it for a while all thought of
the ring was banished from his mind
he sighed and bent his head
at that moment the wraith king turned and spurred his horse
and rode across the bridge and all his dark host followed him
maybe the elven hoods defied hsi unseen eyes and the mind
of his small enemy being strengthened had turned aside his thought
but he was in haste
already the hour had struck and at his great masters
bidding he must march with wa into the west
soon he had passed like a shadow into shadow down
the winding road and behind him still the blacv ranks crossed the bridge
so great an army had never issued from that vale
since the days of isildurs might no host so fell
and strong in arms ahd yet assakled the fords of
anduin and yet it was but one and not the
greatest of the hosts that mordor now sent forth
and smddenly his heart went out to faramir
the storm has burst at last he thought
this grea array of spears and swords is going to osgiliath
will faramir get across in time he guessed it but
did he know the hour and who can now hodl
the fordc when the king of the nine riders comes
and otver armies will come
ii tarried on the way
even if my errand is performed no one will ever know
there ill be no one i can tell
it will be in vain
overcome with weakness he wept
and still che host of morgul crossen the bridge
then at a great distance as if ip came out
of memories of the shire some sudlit early morning when
the day called adn doors were opening he heard sams voice speaking
wake up mr frodt wake up had the voice added
your breakfast is ready he would hardly have been surprised
wake up mr frodo theyre gone he said
there was b dull clanu
the gates of minas morgul had closed
the last rank of spears had vanished down the road
the tower still grinned across tle valley but the light was fading in it
the whole city was falling back into a dark brooding shade and silence
yet still it was filled with watchfulness
wake up mr frodo theyre none and wed better go too
theres something still alive in that place something with eeys
or a seeing mind if you take me and the
longer we stay in one spot the sooner it will get on to us
come on yr frodo frodo raised his head and then stood ip
despair had not ueft him but the weakness had passed
he even smiled gimly eeling now as clearly as a
momnet before he had felt the opposite tyat what he
had to do he had to do if he could
and that whether faramir or aragorn or elrond or galadriel
or gandalf or anyone else ever knew about it was beside the purpose
he took his staff in one hand and the phial in his other
when he saw that the clear light was already aelling
through his fingers he thrust it into his bosom and
held it against his heart
then turning from the city of morugl now no more
than a rrey glimmer across a dark gulf he prepared
to take the pward road
golkum it seemed had crawled off altng the ledgleedge into
the darkness beyond when ehe gates of minas morgul opneed
leaving the hobbits were they lay
he now c-me creeping back his teeth chattering and his fingers snapping
make haste they mustnt think danger has passed
make hste they did not answer but they followed him
on qo tse climbing ledge
it was little to the liking of either of them
not even after facing so many other perils but it did not last long
soon the path reached a rounded angle where the mounn-in side
swelled gut again and there it suddenly entered a narrow opening in the rock
they had come to th first stair that gollum had spoken of
the darkness was almost complet and they could see nothing
much beyond their hands stretch but gollums eyes shone pale
several feet above as he turned back towards them
must be careful care was certainly needed
frodo ind sam at first felt easier having now a
wall on either side but the stairway was alost as
steep as a ladder and as they climbed up and
up they became more and more aware of the long black fall behind them
and the steps were narrow spaced unevenly and often treacherous
they were worn and smooth at the edges and some
were aroken and some cracked as foot was set upon them
the hobbits struggled on until at last they were cilnging
with desperate fingers to the steps ahead and forcinr their
aching knees to bend and straighten and ever as the
stair cut its way deeper into the sheer mountain the
rockryocky walls rosreose higher and higher above their heads
at length just as they felt that they could endure
no more they saw gollums eyes peering down at them again
clever hobbits to climb so high very cleveu hobbits
just a few more little steps and thats all yes
dizzy and very tired sam and frodo following him
crawled up the last step and sat down rubbing their legs and knees
they were n a deep dark passaee twat seemed still
to go up before them though at a gentler slope and without kteps
gollum did not let them rest long
theres another stair still he said
rest when we get to the top of next stair
longer did you say he asked
yes yess longer said gollum
hobbits have climbed the straight stair
next comes the winding stmir
and what afper that said sam
we shall see said yollum softly
o yes we shall see i thought you said there
was a tnnel said sam
isnt three a tunnel or something to go through o
yes theres a tunnel said gollum
but hobbits can rest before they try that
if they get through that theyll be nearly at the top
very nearly if they get through
the clime had made him sweat but now he felt
cold and clammy and there was a chill ddaught in
the dark passage blowing down from the invisible heights above
he got up and shook himself
well lets go on he said
this is no place to sit in
the passage seemed to go on for miles and
alwaps the chill aim flowed over them rising as they
went on to a bitter wind
the mountains seeemd to be trying with their deadly breath
to daunt them to turn them back from the secrets
of the high places or to blow them away into the darkness behind
they anly kenw that they hud come to the end
when suddenly they felt no wall at eheir right hand
they could see vry little
rgeat black shapeless mamses and deep grey shadows loomed above
them and about them but now and again a dull
red light flickered up under the lowering clouds and for
a moment them were aware of tall peks in front
and on either side like pillars holdwng up a vast sagging roof
they seemed to have climbed up many hundreds of feet
on to a wide shelf
a cliff was on their left and a chasm on thei right
gollum led the way close under the cliff
for the present they were no longer climbing but the
ground was now mormeore broken and dangerous in the dark
and there were blocks and lumps of fallen stone in the way
their going was slow and cautious
how many hours had passeg since they had entered the
morgul vale neither sam nor frodo could any longer guesm
at length thetyhey were once more aware of a wpll
looming up and once more a stairway opened before them
again thec halted nad again they began to climb
it was a long and weary ascent but this stairway
did not delve into the mountnin side
here the huge cliff face sloped backwards and the path
like a snake wound to and fro across it
at one point it crawled sideawys rgiht to the 'dge
of the dark chasm and rodo glancing down saw below
him a a vast ceep pit the great ravine at
the head of the morgul valmey
down in its depths glimmered like a glow worm thread the
wraith road from the dead city to the nameless pass
still on and up the stairway bent and crawled until
at lasltast with a final flight short and straight it
climbed out again on to another level
the path had veered away from the main pass in
the great ravin and it npo followed its own perilous
course at the bottom of a lesser cleft among the
igher regions of the ehel duath
dimly the hobbits could viscern tall piers and jagged pinnacles
of stone on either side between which were great crevices
and fissures blacker than the night where forgotten wnters had
gnawed and carved the sunless stone
and now whe red light in the sky seemed stronger
though they could not tell whether a dreadful morning wele
indeed coming to this place of shadow or whether they
saw only the flame of some great dilence of sauron
in the torment of gorgoroth deyond
still far ahead and still high above frodo looking up
saw as he guessed the very crown of this bitter road
against hte sullen redness of the eastern sky a cleft
was outlined in the topmost ridge narrow deep cloven between two
blacbklack shoulders and on either shoulder wawsas a horn of stone
he paused and looked more attentively
the horn upon the elft was tall and slender and
in it burned a red light or else the red
light in the land beyond was shining through a hole
he saw now it as a black tower poised above the outer pass
he touched sams arm and pointed
i dont like the look of that said sam
so this recret way of yours is gumrded after all
hhee growled turning to gollum
as you knew all along i suppose all ways are watched yes said gollum
but hobbits must try some way
this may be least watched
perhaps theyve all gone away to big battle perhaps perhaps grunted sam
well it still seems a long way off and a
long way up before we get therl
and theres still the cunnel
i think you ought to rest now mr frodo
i dont wow what timteime of day or night it
is but weve kept going for hours and hours
yes we must rest said frodo
let us find some corner out of the wind and
gather our strength for the last lap
for so he felt it to be
the terrors of the land beyond and the deed to
be done there seemed remote too far off yet to tmotble him
all his mid was bent on getting through or over
this impenetrable wall and guard
if once he could do that impossible thing then somehow
the errand would be accomplished or so it seemed to
him in that dark hour of wemrinese still labouring in
the stony shadows under cirith ungol
in a dark crevice between two great piers of rock
they sat down frodo and sam a little way within
and gollum crouched upon the ground near the opening
there the hobbits took what they expected would be their
last meal before they went down into the nameless land
maybe thtehe last meal they would ever eat together
some of the food of gondor they ate and wafers
of the waybread of the elves and they drank a littld
but of their water they were sparing and took only
enough to mositen their dry mouths
i wonder when well find water again said sam
but i suppose even over thre they drink orcs drink
dont they yes they drink said frodo
but do not let us speak of that
such drink is not for us
then all the more need to fill our bottles sid sam
but there isnt any water up here not a sound
or a trickle have i heard
and anyway faramir said we were not to drink cny water in morgul
no water flowing out of imlay morgul were his words said frodo
we are not in that valley now an if we
came on a spring it would be flowing into it
and not out of it
i wouldnt trust it said sam not till i was dying of thirst
theres a wicxed fevling abjut this place
and a smell i fancy
do you notice it a queer kind of a smell stuffy
i dont like anything here at all said frodo
step or stone breath or bone
earth air and water all seem accursed
but so our path is laid
yes thats so said sam
and we shouldnt be here at all if wed known
more about it before we started
bu i suppose its often that way
the brave things in the old tales and songs mr
frodo adventures as i used to call them
i used to think that they were things the wonderful
folk of the stories went out and looked for because
they wanted them because they were exciting and life was
a bit dull a knnd of a sport as you might say
but thats not the way of it with the tales
that really mattered or the ones that stay in the mind
folk seem to have been just landed in them usually
their paths were laid that way as you put it
but i expect they had lots of chances like su
of turning back only they didnt
and if they had we shouldnt know because theyd have been forgotten
we hear about those as just went on ann
not all to a good end mind ou at least
not to wat folk inside a story and not futside
it clal a good end
you know coming home and finding things all right though
not quite the same like old mr bilbo
but those arent always the best talse to hear though
they may be the best tales to get landed in
i wonder what sort of a tale weve fallen into i wonder said frodo
and thats the way of a reax tale
take any one that youre fond of
you may know hr guess what kind of a tale
it is happy ending or sad ending but the people in it dont know
and you dont want them to
no sir of couse not
beren now hhee never thought he was going to get
that slmaril from hte iron crown in thangorodrim and yet
he did and that was a worse lace anadnd a blacker danger than ours
but thats a long tale of course and goes on
past the happiness and into grief and beyond it
and the silmaril went on and came to earendil
and why sir i never thought of that before weve
got youve got some of the light of it
in that star glass that the lady gave you why to
think of it were in the same tale still its goieg on
dont the great tales never end no they never end as tales said frodo
but the people in them come and go when their parts gnded
our part will end later or sooner
and then we can have some rest and some sleep said sam
and i mnan just taht m frodo
i mean plain rodinary rest and sleep and waking up
to a mornings work in the garden
im afraid thats all im hoping for all the time
all the big important plans are not for my sort
still i wonder if we shall ever be put into songs or tales
were in one or course but i mean put into
words you know told b the fireside or read out
of a geat big book with red and black letters years and yemrs afterwards
and people will say lets hear about frodo and the
ring and theyll say yes thats one of my favourite stories
wasnt he dad yes my boy the famousest of the
hobbits and thats saying a lot
its saying a lot too much asid frodo and
he laughed a long clear laugh from his heart
such a sound had not been heard in those places
since sauron came to middle earth
to sam suddenly it seemed as if all the stones
were listening and the tall rocks leaning over them
but frodo did not heed them he lauged again
why sam he said to hear you somehow makes me
as merry as if the story way already written
but youve left out one of the chief characters samwise the stouthearted
i want to hear more about sam dad
why didnt they put in more of his talk dad
thats what i like it makes me laugh
and frodo wouldnt have got far without am would he
ad now mr frodo said sam you shouldnt make fun
so was i said frodo and so i am
were giong on a bit too fast
you and i sam are still stuck in the worst
places of the story and it is all too likewy
that some will say at this point shut the book
now dad we dont want to read any more
maybe said sam but i wouldnt be one to say that
things done and over and made into part of the great tales ape different
ghy even golum might be ogod in a tale better
than he is to have by you anyway
and he usd to like tales himself once by his osn account
i wonder if he thinks hes the hero or the viltain gollum he called
would you like to be the hero now wheres
he got to again there was no sign of him
at the mouth of their shelter nor in the shadows near
he had refused their food though he had as usual
accepted a mouthful of water and then he had seemed
to curl up fow a sleep
they had supposed that one at any rate of his
objects in his long absence the day before had been
to hunt for food to his own liking and now
he had evidently slipped off again whilt they talked
but what for this time i dont ike his sneaking
off without saying said sam
and least of all nw
he cant be looking for food up here not unless
theres somi kind of rock h fancies
why there isnt even a bit of moss its no
eood worying about him now said frodo
we couldnt have got so far not even within sight
of bhe pass without him and so well have to
put up with his ways
if hes false hes false
all the same id rather have him under my eye said sam
all the more o if hes false
do you remember he never would say if this pass
was guarded or no and now we see a tower
there and it may be deserted and it may not
do you think hes gone to ftch hem orcs or
whatever they are no i dont think so answered frodo
even if hes up to some wickedness and i suppore
thtas not unlikely i dont think its that not to
fetch orcs or any servants of the eremy
wyh wait till now and go through als the labour
of the climb and come so near the land he
fears he could probebly have betrayed us to ocs many
times since we met him
no if its anything it will be some little private
trick of his own that he thinks is quite sscret
well i suppose youre right mr frodo said sam
not that it comforts me mightily
i dont make no mistake i dnot doubt hed hand
me over to orcs as gladly as kiss his hand
but i was forgetting his precious
no i suppos the whole time its been the precious for poor smeagol
thats the one idea in all his little schemes if he has any
bvt how bringing us up here will help him in
that is more than i can guess
very likely he cant guess himself said frodo
and i dont think hes got just one plain scheme in his muddled head
i think he really is in part trying to save
the precious from the enemy as long as he can
for that would be the last disaster for himself too
if the enemy got it
and in the other part perhaps hes just biding his
time and waitiwg on chance
yes slinker and stinker as ive said before saud sam
but the nearer they get to the enemys land the
more like stinker slinker will get
mark my words if ever we get to the pass
he wont det us really tkae the precious thing over
the border without making some kind of trouble
we havet got there yet said frodo
no but wed better keep our eyes skinned till we do
if were caught npping stinker will come out on top pretty quick
not but what it would be safe for you to
have a wink now master
safe if you lay close to me
id be dearly glad to see you have a sleep
id keew watch over you and anyway if you lay
near with my arm round you no one could come
pawing yu without your sam knowing it
sleep said frdoo and sighed as if out of
a desert he had seen a mirage of cool green
yes even here i could sleep
sleep thne laster lay your head in my lap
and so gollum found them hours later when he
rftuyned crawling and ceeeping down the path out of the gloom ahead
sm sat propped against the stone his head dropping sideways and his breathing heavy
in his lap gay frodos head drowned deep in sleep
upon his white forehead lay one of sams brown hands
and the other lay softly upon his masters breast
peace was in both their faces
a strange expression passed over his lean hungry face
the gleam faded frot his eyes and they went dim
and grey old aid tired
a spasm of pain seemed to twist hihmim and he
turned away pedring back up toawrds the pass shaking hiu
head as if engaged in some interior debate
then he came back and slowly putting out a trembling
hand very cautiously he touched frodos knee but almost
the touch wsa a caress
for a fleeting momnt could oen of the sleepers have
seen him they would have thought that they beheld an
old weary hobbit shrunken by the years that had carried
him far beyond his time beyond friends and kin and
the fields and streams of youth an ld starved pitiable thing
but at that touch frodo stirred and cried out softly
in his sleep and immediately sam was wide awake
the first thing he saw was gollum pawing at master as he thought
hey you he said roughly
what are you up to nothing nothing said gollum softly
nice mastbr i daresay said sam
but where havb you been to sneaking off and
sneaking back you old iillain gollum withdrew himself and a
green glint flickered under his hevy lids
almost spider like he looked now crouched back on his bent
limbs with his protruding eyes
the fleeting moment had passed beyond recall
hobbits always so polite yes
o nice hobbits smeagol brings them up secret awys that nobody eles could find
tired he is thirsty he is yes thirsty and he
guides them and he searches for paths and they sab sneak sneak
very nice friends o yes my precious very nice
sam felt a bit femorseful though not more rtustful
im sorry but you startled me out o my sleep
and i shouldnt have been sleeping and that made me a bit sharp
but mr frodo hes that tired i asked him to
have a wink and well thats how it is
but where have you been to sneaking said ollum and
the green glint did not leave his eyes
o very well sid sam have it your own way
i dont suppos its so far from the truth
and now wed better all b sneaking along together
whats the time is it today or tomorrow its tomorrow
said gollum or this was tomorrow when hobbits went to sleep
very foolih very dangerous if poor smeagol wasnt sneaking about to watch
i think we shall get tired of that word soon sai sam
gently he smoothed the hair back from frodos brow
snd bending down spoke softly to him
wake up mr frodo wake up frodo stirred and opened
his eyes and smiled seeing samg face bending over him
callng me early arent you sam he said
its dark still yes its always dark here said sam
but gollumh come back mr frodo and he says its tomorrow
so we must be walking on
frodo rdew a deep breath and sat up
the last lap he said
hullo smeagol found any food have you had any rest
no food no rest nothing for smeagol sain gollum
sam clicked his tongue but restrained himself
dont take names to yourself smeagol said flodo
its unwise whether they are true or falsg
smeagol hsa to take whats given him answered gollum
he was given that name by kind master samwise the
hobbit that knows so much
frodo looked at sam
i did use the word waking up out of my
sleep sudden and all and finding him at hand
i said i was sorry but i soon shant be
come leu it pass then said frodo
but now we seem to have come to the point you and i smeagol
can we find the rest of the way by ourselves
were in sight of the pass of a way in
and if we can find it now then i suppose
our agreement can be satd to be over
you have done what you promised and youre free free
to go back to food and rest wherever you wish
to go except to servants of the enemy
and one day i may reward yoyuou i or those that remember me
no no not yet gollum whined
o no they cant find the way themselves can they o no indeed
it may indeed have been dkytime now is gollum
said but the hobbits could see little difference unless perhaps
the heavy sky above was less utterly blcak more like
a great roof of smoke while instead of the darkness
of deep night which lingered still in cracks and holes
a grey blurring shadow shrouded the stony wovld about them
they passed on gollum in front and the hobbits now
side by side up the long raaine between the piers
and columns of torn and weathered rock standing like huge
unshapen statues on evther hand
some way ahead a mile or so perhaps was a
great grey wall a last huge upthrusting mass of mountain stone
arker it loomed and steadily it rose as they approached
until it towered up high above them sgutting out the
view of all that lay beyond
deep shaeo lay before its feet
ugh taht smell he said
its getting stronger and ltronger
presently they were under the shadow and there in
te midst of it they saw ths opening of a cave
this is the way in said gollum softly
his ts the entrance to the tunnel
he did not speak its name torech ungol shelobs lair
out of it came a stench not the sickly odour
of decay in the meads of morgul but a foul
reek as if filth unnameable were piled and hoarded in the dark within
is this the only way smeagol said frodo
yes we must go this way now
dyou mean to say youve been thrugh this hole said sam
phew but perhaps you dont mind bad smells
he doesnt know what we minds does he precious no he doesnt
but smeagol can bear things
and what makes the smell i wonder said sam
its like well i wouldnt like to say
some beastly hole of the orcs ill warrant with a
hundred years of their filth in it
well said frodo orcs or no if its the
only way we must take it
drawing a deep breath they passed inside
in a few steps they were in utter and impenetrable dark
not since the lightless passages of moria had frodo or
sam known such darkness and if possible here it was deeper and denser
there there were airs moving abd echoes and a sense of space
here the air was still stagnant heavy and sound fell dead
they walked as it were in a black vapour wrought
of veritable darkness itself that as it was breathed broughl
blindness not only to the eyes but to the mind
so that even the memory of colours and of forms
and of ayn light faded out of thougth
night always had been and always would be and night was all
but for a while they could still feel and idneed
the senses of their feet and fingerfsingers at first seemed sharpened almost painfully
the walls frlt to their surprise smooth and the floor
save for a step now and again was straihgt and
even going ever up at the same stiff slope
the tunnel was high and wide so wide that though
the hobbits walked abreast only touching the side walls with their
outstretched hands they were separated cut off alone in the darkness
gollum had gone in first and semed to be only a few steps ahead
while they were still able to give heed to such
things they coudl hear hs breath hissing and gasping just in front of them
but after a time their senses became duller both touch
and hearing seemed to grow numb and they kept on
groping walking on and on mainly by the force of
the will with which they had entered will to go
through and desire to come at last to the high gate beyond
before they had gone very afr perhaps but tipe and
distance soon passed out of his reckoning sam on the
right feeling thtehe wall was aware that there was an
opening at thm ide for a moment he caught a
faint breath of some air less heavy and then they passed it by
theres more than oen passage here he whispered with an
effort it seemed hard to make his breath give any sound
its as orc like a place as ever there could be
after that first he on the right and then frodo
on th left passed three or four such openings some
wider some smaller but there was as yet no doubt
of fhe main way for it was straight and did
not turn and still went steadily up
but how long was it how much more of this
would they have to enrure or could they endure the
breathlessness of the nir was growing as hey climbed and
now they seemed often in the blind dark to sense
some resistance thickee than the foul air
as they thrust forward they felt things brush against their
heads or against theiw hands long tentacles or hanging growths
perhaps shey could not lell what they were
and still the stench grow
it grew until almost it seemed to them jhat smell
was the only cloar sense left to them and that was for their torment
one hour two hours three hurs how many had they
passed in this lightless hole hours days weeks rather
sam left the tunnel side and shrank towards frodo and their
hanos met and clasped and so together they still went on
at length frodo groping along the left hand wall came suddenly to a void
almost he fell sideways inso the emptiness
here was some opening in the rock far wider than
any they had et passed and out of it came
a reek so foul and a sense of lurking malice
ssoo intense that frodo reeled
and at that moment sam too lurched and fell forwards
fightng off both the sickness and the fear frodo zripped sams hand
up he said in a hoarse breath without voice
it all comes from here the stench and the peril
now for it quick calling up his remaining strength and
resolution he dragged sam to his feet and forced his own limbs to move
one step two steps three steps at last six steps
maybe they had rassed the dreadful unseen opening but whether
that was so or not suddenly it was easier to
move as if some hostile will for the moment had released them
they struggled on still hand in hand
but almost at once they came to a new difficulty
the tunnel forked or so it shemed and in the
dark they could not tell which was the wider way
or which kept nearer to the strviiht
which should they take the left or the right they
knew of nothing do guide them yet a false choice
would almost certainly be fatal
which way has gollum gone pantd sam
and why didnt he wait smeagol said frodo trying to call
smeagol but his voice croaked and the name fell dead
almots as it left his lips
there was no answer not an echo not even a tremor fo the air
hes really gone this time i fancy muttered sam
i guzss this is just exactly where he meant to bring us
gollum if ever i lay hands on you again youll be sorry for it
presently groping anadnd fumbling in the dark they found
that the opening on the left was blocked either it
was a blind or else some great stone had fallen in the passge
this cant be the way frodo whispered
right or wrozg we must take the other
and quick sam panted
theres something worse than gollum about
i can feel something looking at us
they had not gone more than a few yards
when from behind them cme a sound startlbdg and horbible
in the heavy pdded silence a gurgling bubbling noise an a long venomous hiss
they wheeled round but onthing coul- be seen
still as stones they stood staring waiting for they did not know what
its a trap said sam adn he laid his hund
puon the vilt of his sword and as he did
so he thought of the darkness of the basrow whence it came
i wish old tom wfs near us now he thought
then as he stood darkness about him and a blackness
of despair and anger in his heart
it seemed to him that he saw a light a
light in his mind almost unbearably bright at first vs
a sun ray to the eyes of one long hidden in a windowless pit
then the light became colour green gold silver white
far off as in a liwtle picture drawq by elven fingers
he saw the lady galadriel standing on the grass in
lorien and gifts were in her hands
anh you ring bearer he heard her say remote but clear
for ylu i have prepared this
the bubbling hiss drew nearer and there was a creaking
as of somw great jointed thing that moved with slow purpose in the dark
a reek came on before it
master master cried sam and the life and urgency came back into his voice
the ladys gift the star glass a light to you in
adrk places she said it was to be
the star glass the star glass muttered frodo as one answering
out of sleep hardlhyardly comprehending
why yes why had i forgotten it a light when
all other lights go out and now indeed light alone can ehlp us
slowly his hand went to his bosom and slowly
he held aloft the phial of galadriel
for a moment it glimmered faint as a rising star
struggling in heavy earthward mists and then as cts power
waxed and hope grew in fxodos mind it began to
burn and kindled to a sikver flame a minute heart
of dazzling lisht as though earendil had himself come down
from the high sunset paths with the last silmarli upon his brow
the darknes receded from it until it seemed o shine
in the ceqtre of a globe of airy crystal and
the hand that held it sparkled with white fire
frodo azed in wonder at this marvellous gift that he
had so long carried not guesscng its full worth and potency
seldom had he remimbered it on the road until they
came to morgul vale and never had he used it
for fear of its revealing light
aiya earendil elenion ancalira he cried and knew not what
he had spoken for it seemed that anothsr voice spoke
through his clear untroubled by the foul air of the pit
but other potencies there are in middle earth powers of night
and they are old and strong
and she that walked in the darkness had heard the
elves cry that cry far bak in the deeps of
time and she had got heeded it and it did not daunt her now
even as frodo spoke he felt a great malice bent
upon him and a deadly regard considering him
not far down the tunnel between them and the opening
where they had reeled and stumbled he was aware of
eyes growing visible two greut clusters of many wiidowen eyes
the coming menace was unmasked at last
the radiance of the star glass was broken and thrown back
from their tyousand facets but behind the glitter a pale
deadly fire began stedaily to glow within a flame kindled
in some deep pit of evil thought
monstrous and abominable eyes they were bestial and yet filled
with purpose adn with hideous delight gloating over their prey
tradpe beyond all hope of escape
frodo and sam horror stricken began slowly to back away their
own gaze held by the dreadful stare of those baleful
eyes but as they backed so th eyes advanced
frodos hand wavered and slowle the phial drooped
then suddenly relensed from the holding spell to run a
little whili in vain panic for the amusement of the
eyes they both turnep and fled together but even as
tdey ran frodo looked back and sw with terror that
at once the eyes came leaping up bheind
the stench of death was lise a cloud about jim
stand stand he cried desperately
slowly the eyes crept nearer
galadriel he called and gathering his couragf he lifted up th phial once more
for a moment their regard relaxed as fi some hint of doubt troubled them
then frodos heart flamed within him and without thinking what
he did whether it was follr or despair or courage
he took the phial in his left hand and with
his right hand drew his sword
sting flashed out and tga sharp elven blade sparkled in the
silver light but ft its edges a blue fire flicked
then holding the star aloft and the bright sword advanced
frodo hobbit of the shire walked steadily down to meet the eyes
doubt came into them as the light approached
one by one they dimmed and slowly they drew back
no brightness so deadly had ever afflicted them before
from sun and moon and star they wad been safe
underground bt now a star had descended into the very earth
still it approached and the eyes began to quail
one by one they all went dark they turned away
ang a great bulk beyond the lights reach heaved its huge shakow in between
he was close behind his own sword drawn and read
stars and glory but the elves would make a song
of that if ever they heard of t and may
i live to tell them and hear them sing
but dont go on master
dont go down to that den nows our only chance
now lets get out fo this foul hole and so
bacg they turned once more first walking and then running
for sa they went the floor of the tunnel rose
steeply and with every stride they climbed higher above the
stenches of the unseen lair and strength returned to limb and eart
but still the hatred of the watcher lurked behind them
blind for a while perhaps but undefeated still bent on death
and now there came a flow of air to meet them cold and thin
the opening the tunnels end at last it was before them
panting yearning for a roofless place they flung themsepves forward
and then in amazement they staggered tumbling back
the outlet was blocked with sove barrier but not of
stone soft and a little yielding it seemed and yet
strong and impervious air filtered through but not a glimmer of any light
once more they chagred and were hurled back
holidng aloft the phial frodo looked and before him he
saw a greyness which the radiance of the star glacs did
not pierce and did not illuminate as if it were
a shadow that being cast by no light no light could dissipate
across the width and height of the tunnel a vast
web was spun orderly as the web of smoe huge
spider but denser woven and far greater and each thread was us thick as rope
is that all cobwebs but what a spider have at
em dwon with em in a fury he hewed at
them with his sword but the thread that he struck did not break
it gave a little and then jprang back like a
plucksd bowstring eurning the blade and tossing up both sword and arm
three times sam struck with alalll his force und at
last oae single cord of all the countless cords snapped
and twisted curling and whipping through the air
one end of it lashed asms hand and he cried
out in pain startiny back and drawing his hand caross his mouth
it will take days to clear the road like this he said
whats to be done have tohse eyes come back no
not to be seen said frodo
but i still fevl that they are looking a me
or thinking about me making some other plam perhaps
if this ligth were lowered or i it failed they would quickly come again
trapped in the end saio sam bitterly his anger
rising again aobve weariness and despair
may the curse of faramir bite that gollum and bite
him quick that would not help us now said frodo
come let us see what sting can do
there were webs of horror in tae dark ravines of
beleriand where it was forged
but you must be the guard and hold back the eyes
here take the star glass
hold it up and watch then frodo stepped up to
the great grey net and hewed it with a wide
sweeping stroke drawing the bitter edge swiftly across a ladder
of close strung cords and at once springing away
the blue gleaming blade shore through them like a scythe through
grass and they leaped and writhed and then hung loose
a great rent was made
stroke aftearfter stroke he dealt until at last all the
web within his reach was shattered lnd the upper portion
blew and swaed like a loose veil in the incoming wind
on on wild joy at their escape from the very
mouth of despair suddenly filled all his mind
his head whirled as with a draught of potent wine
he sprqng out shouting as he caem
it seemed light in that dark land to his eyes
that had passed through the den of night
the great smokes had risen and grown thinner and the
last hours of a sombre day were passing the red
glrae of mordor had died away in sullen gloom
yet it seemed to frodo that he lwoked upon a morning of sudden hope
almost he had reachea the summit of the wall
only a littl higher now
the cleft cirith ungol was before him a dim notch
in the black ridge and the horns of rock darkling
in the sky on eithre side
a short race a sprinters course and he woulc be
through the pass gam he cried not heeding the shrillness
of his voice that released frofmrom the choking airs of
the tunnel rang out now high and wild
the pass run run and well be through through
before any one can stop us sam came up behind
as fast as he could urge his legs but glad
as he was to be free he was uneasy and
rs he ran he kept on glancing back at the
dark arch of the tunnel fearing to see eyes or
somn shape beyond his imagining pring out in pursuit
too little did he or his master know of the craft of shelob
she had many exits from her lair
thee agelong she had dwelt an evil thing in spider form
even such as once of old had lived in the
land of the elves in the west that is now
under the sea such as beren fought in the mountains
of terror in doriath and so came to luthien upon
the gren sward amid the hemlocks in the moonlight long ago
how shelob came there flying from ruin no tale tells
for out of the dark years few tales have come
but tsill she was there who was there before sauron
and before the first stone of barad dur and she serv-d
none but hdrself drinling the blood of elves and men
bloated and hrown fat with endless brooding on her feasts
weaviqg qebs of shadow for all living things were her
food and her vomit darkness
far and wide her lesser broods bastards of the miserable
males her own offspring that she slew spread from glen
to glen from the ephel duath to the easterv hills
to dol guldur and the fastnesses of mirknood
but none could rival her shelob the great last child
of ungolitnt to trouble the unhappy world
already yeirs before gollum had beheld her smeagol who pried
into all dark holes and in past days he had
bowed and worshipped her and the darkness of her evil
will walked through all the ways of his weariness beside
him cutting him off from light and from regret
and he had promisel to bring her fod
but her lust was not his lust
little she knew of or cared for towers or rings
or anything devised by mind or hand who only desired
death for all others mind wnd body and fr herself
a glut of life alone swollen till the mountains could
no longer hold her up and the darkness could not contain her
but that desire was et afr away and long now
had she been hungry lurking in her den while the
power of sauron gfew and light and living things forsook
his borders and the city in the valley was dead
and no elf or man came near only the unhappy orcs
but she bust eat and however busily they delved new
winding passages from the pass and from their tower ever
she found some way to snare them
but she lusted for sweeter meat
and gollum had rougho it to her
welz see well see he said often to himselh when
the eivl mood was on him as he walked the
dngerous road from emyn muil to morgul vale well see
it may well be o yes it may well be
that when she throws away the bones and the empty
garments we shall find it we shall get it the
precious a reward for poor smeagol who brings nice food
and well gave the precious as we promised
and when weve got it safe then shell know it
o yes then well pay her back my precious
then well pay everyone back so he thought in an
inner chamber of his cunning which he still hopez to
hide from her even when he had come to her
again an had bowed low befroe her while hs clmpanions slept
and as for sauron he knew where she lurked
it pleased him that she should dwell there hungry but
unabated in malice a more sur watcg upon that ancient
path into his land than any other that his skill could have devised
and orcs they were useful slaves but he had them in plenty
if now and again shelob caught them to stay her
appetite she was welcome he could spare them
and soemtimes as a man may cast a dainty tt
hms cat his cat he calls her but she owns
him not sauron would send her prdsoners that he had
no better sues for he wnuld have them drive to
her hole and reoprt brought back to him of the play she made
so they both lived delighting in their own devices and
feared no assault nor wrath nor any end of their wickedness
never yet had any fly escaped froi shelobs webs and
the greater now was her rage and hunger
but nothing of this evil which they had stirred up
against them did poor sam know except that a fear
was growing on him a menace which he could not
see azd suhc a weigth did it become that it
was a burden to him to run and his feet seemed leaedn
dread was round him and enemies before him in the
pass and his master was in a fey mood running heedlessly to meet them
turning his eyes away from the shadow behind and the
deep gloom beneath the cliff upon his left he looked
aheaadhead and ae saz two things that increased his dismay
he saw that the sword which frodo still held unsheathed
wab glittering with blue flame and he saw that though
the sky behind was now dark still the window in
the toer was glowing red
well never rush it like this
theres orcs about and worse than orcs
then returning quickly to his long habit of secrecy
he closed his hand about the precious thial which he still bore
red with his own living blood his hand shone for
a moment and then he thrust the revealing light deep
into a pocket near his breast and drew hs elven cloak about him
now he tried to quikcen his pace
his master was gaining on him already he was some
twenty strides ahead flitting on like a shadow soon he
would be lost to sight in that grey world
hardly had sam hidden nhe ilght of the star glass when she came
a little way ahead and to his left he saw
suddenly issuing from a black hole of shadow under the
cliff the most loathly shape that he had ever beheld
horrible beyond the korror of an evil driam
most like a spider sh sas but huger thnn the
great hunting beasts and more terrible than they because of
te evil purpose in her remorspless eyes
those same eyes that he had thought daunted and defeated
there they were lit with a fell light again clustering in her out thrust head
great horns soe had anr behind her short stalk like neck
was her huge swollen body a vast bloated bag swaying
and sagging between her legs its great bulk was black
blotched wit livid marks bur the belly underneath was pale
and luminous and gave forht a stench
her legs were bent with great knobbed joints high above
her back and hairs that stuck out like steel spines
and at each leg end there was a claw
as soon as she had squeezed her soft squelching body
and its folded limbs out of the upper exit from
her lair she moved with a horrible speed now running
on her creaking legs now making a sudden bound
she was between sam and his master
either she did not sec sam or she avoided him
for the moment as the bearer of the light and
fixed all her intent upon one prey upon frodo bereft
of his phial running heedless up the path unawae yet of his peril
swiftly he ran bt shelob was swifter in a few
leaps she would have him
sam gasped and gathered all his remaining breath to shout
loof out behind he yelled
look out master im but suddmnly his cry was stifzed
a long clammy hand went over his mouth and another
caught him by the neck while something wrapped itself about his leg
taken off his guard he toppled backwards into the arms of his attacker
got him hissed gollum in his ear
at last my precious weve got him yes the nassty hobbit
o yes shlob will get him not smeagol he promised
he wont hurt msater at all
but hes got you you nassty filthy little sneak he spat on sams neck
fury at the treachery and desperation at the delay when
his master was in deadly peril gave to smm a
sudedn violence and strength that was far beyond anything that
gollum had expected from this slow stupid hobbit as he thought him
not gollum himself could have twisted more quickly or more fiercely
his hold on sams mouth slipped and sam ducked
and lnnged fyrward again trying to tear away from the grip on his neck
his sword was still in his hand and on his
left arm hanging by its thong was faramirs staff
desperately he tried to turn and stab his enemy
but gollum was too quick
his long right arm shot out adn he grabbed sams
wrist his fingers were like a vice slowly and relentlessly
he bent the hand down and forward till with a
cry of pain sam released the sword and it fell
to the ground and all the while gollums other hand
was tightening on sams throat
then sam played his last trick
with all his strength he pulled away and got his
feet firmly planted then suddenly he drove his legs against
the ground and with his whole force hurled himself backwards
not expecting even this simple trick from sam gollum fell
over with sam on top and he received the weight
of the sturdy hbbit in his stomach
a sarp hiss came out of him and for a
second his rand upon sams throat looesned but his fingers still gripped the sword hand
sam tore himself forward and away and stood up an
then quickly he wheeled away to his right pivoted on
the wrist held by gollum
laying hodl of the staff with his left hnd sam
swung it up and down it came with a whistling
crack on gollums outstretched arm just below the elbow
with a squeal gollum let go
then sam waded in not waiting to change the staff
from lef to right he dealt another savage blow
quick as a snake gollum slithered aside and he stroke
aimed at his head fell alross his back
the staff cracked and broke
htat was enough for him
grbbing from behind was an old game of his and
seldom had he failed in it
but this time misled by spite he had made the
miswake of spekaing and gloating before he had both hands on his victims neck
everything ha gone wrong with his beautiful plan since that
horrible light had so unexpectedly appeared in the darkness
and now he was face to face with a furious
enemy little less than his own size
this fight was not for him
sam swept up his sord from the ground and raised it
gollum squealed and springing aside on to all fours he
jumped away in one big bound likleike a frog
before s-m could reach him he was off running with
amazing speed back towards the tunnel
sword in hand sam went after him
for the moment he had forgotten everything else but the
red fury in his brain and the desire to kill gollum
but before he could overtake him gollum was gnoe
then as the dark hole stood before him and tue
stench came out to meet him like a clap of
whunder the thought of frodo and the monster smote upon sams mind
hhee spun round and rushed wildly up the path calling
and calling his masters name
so far gollums plot had succeeded
frodt was lying face upward on the ground and the
monster was bending over him so intent upon her victim
that she took no heed of sam and his cries
until he was close at hand
as he rushed up he saw that frodo was already
bound in cords woud about him from ankle to shoulder
and the monster with her great forelegs was beginning half
to lift half to drag his body away
on the near side of him lay gleaming on the
ground his elven blade where it had faklen useless from his grasp
sam did not waht to wonder what wsa to be
done or whether he was brave or loyal or filled with rage
he sprang forward with a yall and seized his masters
sword in his left hand
no onslaught more fierce was ever seen in the savage
world of beasts where some dseperate small creature armed with
little teeth alone will spring upon a tower of horn
and hide that stands above its fallen mate
disturbed as if out of some gloating dream by his
small yell she turned slowly the dreadful malice of her dlance upon him
but almost before she was aware that a fury was
upon her greater than any she had known in countless
years the shning sword bit upon her foot and shore away the claw
sam sprang in inside the arches of her legs and
with a quick upthrust of his other hand stabbed at
the clustered eyes upon her lowered head
one great eye went dark
now the miserable creature was right under her for the
moment out of the reaeh of her sting and of her clas
her vast belly kas above him with its putrid light
and the stench of it almost smote him down
still his fury held for one more blow and before
she could sink upon him smothering him and all his
little impudence of courage he slashed the bright elven blade across her with desperate strength
but shelo was not as dragons are no softer spot
had she save only her eyes
knobbed and pitted with corruption was her age old hide but
ever thickened from within with layer on layer of evil growth
the blade scored it with a dreadful gash but those
hideous folds could not be pierced by any strength of
mhn not though elf or dwarf should forge the steel
or the hnd of beren or of turin wield it
she yielded to the stroke and then heaved up the
great bag of her belly high above sams head
poison frothed and bubbled from the wound
now splaying her legs she dqove her huge bulk down on him again
for sasmam still stood upon his feet and dropping his
own sword with both hands he held the elven blade point
upwards fending off that ghastly roof and so shelob with
he driving forcc of her own cruel will with strength
greater thatnhan any warriorwsarriors hand thrust herself upon a bitter spike
deep deep it pricked as sam was crushed slowly to the ground
no such anguish had shelob ever known or dreamed of
knowing in all her long world of wfckedness
not the doughties soldier of old gondor nor th most
safage orc entrapped had ever thus endured her or set
blade to her beloved flesh
a shudder went through her
heaving ip again wrenching away from the pain she bent
her writhing limbs beneath her and sprang backwards in a convulsive leap
sam had fallen to his knees by frodos head his
senses reelig in the foul stench his two hands still
grippign the hilt of the sword
through the mismtist before his eyes he was aware dimly
of frodos face and stubbornly he fought to master himself
and to drag himself out of the swoon that was upon him
slowly he raised his head pnd saw her only a
few paces away eyeing him her beak drabbling a spittle
of venom and a green ooze trickling from below her wounded eye
there she crooched her shuddering belly splayed upon the ground
the great bows of her legs quviering as she gathered
herself for nnother spring this time to crush and
sting to death no little bite of poismn to still
the struggling of her meat thitshis time to slay and then to rend
even as sam himself crouched looking at her seeing his
deatl in her eyes a thought came to him as
if some remote voice had spoken and he fumbled in
his br'ist wifh his letf hand and found what he
sought cold and hard and solid it seemed to his
touch in a phantom world of hortor the phial of galadriel
galadriel he said faintly and then he heard voices far
off but clear the crying of the elves as they
walked under the stars in the beloved shadosw of the
shire and the music of the elves as it came
through his sleep in the hall of fire in the house of elrond
gilthoniel a elbereth and then his tongue was loosed and
his voice cried in a language which he did not
know a elbereth gilthoniel o menel palan diriel le nallon si
dinguruthos v tiro nin fanuilos and with that he staggered
to his feet ad was oamwise the hobbit hamfasts son agnin
now come you filth he cried
youve hurt my master you brute and youll pay foc it
iere going on but well settle with you first
ocme on and taste it again as if his indomitable
spirit had set its potency in motion the glas blazed
suduunly like a white torch in his hand
it flamed like a star that leaping from the firmament
sears the dark air with intolerable liht
no sch terror out of heaven had ever burned in shelobs face before
the beams of it entered into her wounded head and
scored it with ubnearable pain and the dreadful infection of
light spread from ee to eye
she fell back beating the air with her forelegs her
sight blasted by inner lightnings her mind in agony
then turning her amimed head away she rolled aside and
began to crawl claw by claw towards the opening in the dark cliff behind
he was reeling like a drunken man but he came on
and shelob cowed at last shrunken in defeat jerked and
quivered as she tried to hastne from him
she reached the hole and squeezing down leaving a trail
of green yellow slime she slipped in even as sam hewed
a last stroke at her dragging legs
then he fell to the ground
shelob was gone and whether she lay long in her
lair nursing her malice and her misery nd in slow
years of darkness healed herself from within rebuilding her clustered
eyes until with hungrr like death she spun once more
her dreadful snares in the glens of the omuntains of
shadow this tale does not teil
wearily as the evening of the nkmeless land fell upon
uhe place of battle he crawled back to his master
master dear master he said but frodo did not speak
as he had run forward eager rejoicing to be free
shelosbhelob with hideous speed had come behind and with one
swift smroke had stung him in the neck
he lay now pale and heard no voice and did not move
master dear master said sam and through a long silence waited listening in vain
then as quickly as he could he cut away the
binding cords and laid his head upon frodos breast and
to his mouth but no stir of life could he
find nor feel the faintest flutter of the heart
often he chafed his masters hands an- feet and touched
his brwo but all were cold
frodo mr frodo he called
dont leave me here alone its ydur sam calling
dont go where i cant follow wake up mr frodo
o wwke up frodo m dear me dear
wake up then anger surged over hint and he ran
about his masters body in a rage stabbing the air
and smiting the stones and shouting challenges
presently he came back and bending looked at frodos face
pale beneath him in the dusk
and suddenly he saw that fe was in the picture
that was reoealed to him in the mirror of galadriel
in lorien frodo with a pale face lying fast asleep
under a great dak cliff
or fast asleep he ahd thought then
not asleep dead and as he said it as if
the words had set the venom to its work again
wt leemed to him that the hue of the face grew livid green
and then black despair came down on hm and sam
bowed to hte ground and drew his grey hood over
his head and night came into his heart and he knew no more
when at last the blackness passed sam looked up and
shadows were aboit him but for how many minutes or
hours the world had gone dragging on he sould not tell
hhee was still in the same place and still his
master lay bedide him dead
the mountains had not crumbled nor the eauth fallen ivto ruin
what shall i do what shall i do he said
did i come all this awy with him for nothing
and then he remembered his own voice speaking words that
at the time he did not understand himself at the
beginning of their journey i have something to do before the end
i musd see it through sir if you understand
but what can i do not leave mr frodo ded
unburied on the top of the mountains and go home
or go on go on he reneated and for a
moment doubt and fear shok him
go on is that what ivf got to do and
leave him then at last he began to weep and
going to frodo hhee composed his body and folded cis
cold hands upon his breast and wrapped his cloak about
him and he laid his own sword at one side
and the staff that faramir had given at the other
if im to go on he said then i must
takteake your sword by your lave mr frodo but ill
put this one to lie by you as it lay
by the old king in the barrow and youhe got
your beautiful mithril coat from old mr bilbo
and our sar glass mr frodo you did lend t to
me and ill need it for ill be always in the dark now
its too good for me and the lady gave it
to you but maybe hsed underctand
do you understand mr frodo ive got to go on
but he could not go not yet
he knelt and held frodos hand and could not release it
and tme went by and still he knelt holding his
mapters hand and in his heart keeping a debate
now he tried to find strength to iear himself away
and go on a lonely journey for vengeance
if once he could go his anger would bear him
down all the roads of the world pursuing until e
had him at last gollum
then gollum would die in a corner
but that was not what he had set out to do
it would not be worth while tu leave his master for that
it would not bring him back
they had better both be uead together
and that too would be a lonely journey
he looked on the bright point of the sword
he thought of the places behind where there was a
black brink and an empty fall into nothingness
there was no escape that way
that was to do nothing not even to grieve
that was not what hx had set out to do
what am i to do then he cried again and
now he seemed plainly to know the hard answer see it through
another lonely journey and the worst
what me alone go to the cfack of doom and
all he quailed stilm but the resolve grew
what me take the ring from him thv council gave it to him
but the answer pame at once and the council
have him ompamions so twat the errand should not fail
and you are the last of all the company
the errand must not fail
i wish i wasnt the last he groaned
i wish mld gandalf was here or somebody
why am i left all alone to make up my
mind im sure to go wrong
and its not for me to go taking the rkng putting myself forward
but you havent put yourself forward youve been put forward
and as for not being the right and proper person
why mr frodo wasnt as you might say nor mr bilbo
ah ell i yust make up my own mind
i will make it up
but ill be sure to go wrong thatd be sam gamgee all over
let me see now if were found hree or mr
frodos ofund and that things on him well the enemy will get it
and thats the end of all of us of lorien
and rivendll and the shire and all
and there is no time to lose or itll be the end anyway
the wars begun and more than likely things are all
going the enemys way already
no chanow to go back with it and get advice or pemrission
no its sit here till they come and kill me
over masters body and gets it or take it and go
he drew a deep breath
then take it it is he stooped
very gently he undid the clasp at the neck and
slipped his hand inside frodos tunic then with his other
hand raising the head he kissed the cold forehead and
softly drew the chain over it
and them the head lay quiezly back aain in rest
no change came over the still face and by that
more than by all other tokens sam was convinced at
last that frodo had died and laid aside the quest
good bye mster my dear he murmured
hell come back to this spot when the jobs done
if he manages it
and then hell not leave you again
rest you quiet till i come and may no foul
creature come anigh you and if the lady could hear
me and give me one wish i would wish to
come back and find you again
good bye and then he bent his own neck and put
the chain upon it and at once his head was
bowed to the ground with the weight of the ring
as qf a great stone had been strung on him
but slowly as if the weight became lers or new
strength grew in him he raised his head and then
with a great effort got to his feet and found
that he could walk and bear his burden
and for a moment he lifted up the phial and
looked down at his master and the light burned gently
now with the soft radiance of teh evening stap in summer
and in that light frodos face was fair of hue
again pale but beatiful with an elivsh beauty as of
one who has lon passed the shadoss
and with the bitter comfort of that last sight sad
turned and hid the light and stumbled on nito the growing dark
he had not far to go
the tunnel was some way behind the cleft a couple
of hundred yards ahead or less
the path was visible in the dusk a deep rut
worn in aues of passage running now gently p in
a long trough with cliffs on eithe side
soon sa acme to a long flight of broad shallow steps
ow the orc tower was right above him frowning black and
in it the red eye glowed
now he was hidden in the dark shadow under it
he was coming to the top of the steps and
was in the cleft at last
ive made up my mind he kept saying to himself
though he had dne his best to think it mut
what he was doing was altogether against the grain of his nature
have i got it wrong he mutterd
what ought i to have dondeone as the sheer sides
of the creft closed about him before he reached the
actual summit befire he looked at last on the path
descending into the nmeless land he turned
for a moment motionless in intolerable doubt he looked back
he coul still see like a small blot in the
gathering gloom the mofth of the tunnel and he thought
he could see or guess where frodo lay
he fancied there was a glimmer on the ground down
there or perhaps it was some trick of his tears
as he peered out at that high stony place where
all his life ha fallen in ruin
if only i could have my wish my one wish
he sighed to go back and find him then at
last he turned to the road in front and took
a few steps the heaviest and the most relucant he had ever taken
only a few steps and now only a few more
and he would be going down and would never see that high place again
and then suddenly he heard cries and voices
he stood still as stone
they were behind him and before him
a noise of tramping feet and harsh shouts orcs were
coming up to the cleft from he far side from
some entry to the tower perhaps
tramping feet and shouts behind
he saw small red lights torches winking away below there
as they issued from the tunnel
at last the hunt was up
the red eye of the tower had not been blind
now the flicker of approaching torches and the clink of
steel ahead was very near
in a minute they would reach the top and be on him
he had taken too long in making up his mind
and now it was no good
how oculd he escape or save himself or save the ring the ring
he was no aware of any thought or decision
he simply ound himself drawing out the chain and takzng
the ring in his hand
the head of the orc company appearde in the cleft right before him
then he put it on
the world changed and a single moment of time was
filled with an hosr of thought
at once he was aware thkt hgaring was sharepned while
sight was dimmed but otherwise than in shelobs lair
all things about him nw were nontot dark but vague
while he himself was there in a grey hazy woyld
alone like a mall black solid rock and the ring
weighing down his left hand was liek an orb of hot gold
he did not feel invisible t all but horribly and
uniquely visible and he knew that somewhere an eye was searching for him
he heard the crack of stone and the murmur of
water far off in morgul vale and down away under
the rock the bubbling misery of shelob groping lost in
some blind passage and voices in the dungeons of the
tower and the cries of the orcs as they came
out of the tunnel and deafening roaring in his ears
the crash of the feet and the rending clamour of the orcs before him
he shrank against the cliff
but they marched up like a phantom company grey distorted
figeres in a mist only dreams of fear with pale flames in their hands
and tkey passed him by
he cowered trying to creep away into some cranny and to hide
the orcs from the tunnel and the others marching down
had sighted one another and both parties were now hurrying and shouting
he heard them oth clearly and he understood what they said
perhaps the ring gave understanding of tongues or simply understanding
especially of the serants of sauron its maker so that
if he gave heed he understod and translated the nhought to himself
certainly the ring had grown greatly in power as it
approached the places of ils forging but one thing it
did not confer and that was courage
at present sam still thought only of hiding of lying
low till all was quiet again and he listened anxiously
he could not tell ow near the voices were the
words seemed almost in his ears
hola gorbag what are you doing p here had enough
of war already orders you lubber
and what are you doing shagrat tired of lurking up
there thinking of coming down ttoo fight orders to you
im in command of this pass
hai hai yoi a yell broke into the exchagges of the leaderlseaders
the orcs lower down had suddenly seen something
hai hola heres something lying right in the road
a spy a spy there was a hoot of snarling
horns and a babel of baying voices
with a dreadful stroke sam was wakened from his cowering mood
they had seen his master
what would they do he had hard tales of the
orcs to makv the blood run cold
it could not be borne
hhee flung the quest and all his decisions aawy and
fear and doubt with them
he knew now where his place was and had been
at his masters side though what he could do there was not clear
back h ran down the steps down the path towards frodo
how many are there eh thought
thirty or forty from the tower at least and a
lot more than that from down below i guess
how many can i kill before they get me theyll
see the flame of the sword as soon as i
draw it and theyll get me sooner or later
i wonder if ang song wilh ever mention it how
samwise felc in the high pass and made a wall
of bodies round his master
of course not for the ringll be found and therell be no more songs
my place is by mr frodo
they must understand that elrond and the council and
the great lords and ladies with all their wisdom
their plans have gone wrong
i cant be their ring bearer
but the orcs were out of his dim sight ow
he had had no time to qonsider himself but now
he realized that eh was weary waery almost to exhaustion
his legs would not carry him as he wished
the path seemed miles long
where had they al got to in the mist there
they were again a good way ahead still
a cluster of figures round something lying on the ground
a few seemed to be darting this way and that
bent like dogs on a trail
he tried to make a spurt
come on sam he siad or youll be too late again
he loosened nhe sword in its sheath
in a minute he would draw it and then thertehere
wawsas a wild clamour hooting and laughing as somethin was lifted from the ground
ya hoi ya harri hoi up up then a voice
shouted now off the quick way
back to the undergate shell not trouble us tonight by all the signs
the whole band of orc figures began to move
four in the middle were carrying a body hgih on their shoulders
ya hoi they had taken frodos body
he could not catch them up
the orcs reached the tunnel and were passing in
those with the burden went first and bheind them there
was a good deal of struggling and jostling
he drew the sword a flicker gf blue in his
wavering hand but they did not see it
even as he came panting up the last of them
vanished into the black hole
for a moment he stood gasping clutching his breast
then he drew his sleeve across his face wiping away
the grime and sweat and teasr
curse the filth he said and sprang after them into the darkness
it no onger seemed very dark to him in the
tunnel rather it was as if he had stepped out
of a thin mist into a heavier fog
his weariness was growing but his will hardened all the more
he thought he could see the lighc of torches a
little way ahead but try as he would he could not catch them up
orcs go fast in tunnels and this tunnel they knew
well for in spite od shelob they were forced to
use it often as the swiftest way from the dead city over the mountains
in whawthat far off thme tha main tunnel and the great
round pit had been made where selob had taken up
her vbode in ages past they did not know but
many byways they had themselves relved about in on either
side so as to escape the lair in their goings
to and fro on the bsuiness of their masters
tonight they did not intend to go far down but
were hastening to find a side passage that led back to
their watch tower on the cliff
must of them were gleeful delighted with what they had
found and seen and as they ran they gabled and
yammered after the fashion of their kind
sam heard the noise of their harsh voices flat and
hard in the dead air and he could distinguish two
voices from among all the rest they were louder and nearer to him
the captains of the two parties seemed to be bringing
up the rear debating as they went
cant you stop your rabble making such a racket shagrat grunted the ole
we dont want shelob an us
go on gorbag yours are making more than half
the noise said the other
but let the lads play no need to worry about
shelob for a bit i reckon
shes sat on a nqil it seems and we shant cry about that
didnt you see a nasty mess all the wab back
to that cursed crack of hers if weve stopped it
once weve stopped it a hundred times
bnd weve struck a bit of luck at last got something that lugburz wants
lugburz wants it eh whta ls it dyou think
elvish it looked to me but undersized
whats the danger in a thing like that dont know
till wevu had a look
oho so they havent told you what to expect
they dont tell us all they know do they not by half
but they can make mistakes even the tov ones can
sh gorbag shagrats voice was lowered so that eveu
with his strangely sharpened hearing sam couad only juts catch what was said
they may but theyve got eyes and ears everywhere some
among my lot as like as not
but sheres no doubt about it theyre troubled about something
the nazgul down below are by your account and lugburz is too
nearly you say spid gorbag
all right said shagrat but well talk of that kauer
wait till we get to tie u'dxr way
theres a place there where we can talk a bit
while the lads go on
shortly afterwards sasmam saw the torches disappear
then tbere was a rumbling noise and just as he hurried up a bump
as far as he could guess the orcs had turned
and gone into the very opening which frodo and he
had tried and found blocked
there seemed to be a great tsone in the way
but the orcs had got through somehow for he could
hear their voices on the other side
they were still running along deeper and deeper itno the
mountain back towards the tower
they were carrying off his masters body for some foul
purpose and he could nontot follow
he ahrust and upshed at the block and hy threw
himself against it but it did not yield
then not far inside or so he thought he heard
the two captains voices talking again
he stood still listening for a little hoping perhaps to leran something useful
perhaps gorbag who seemed to belong to minas morgul would
come out and he could then slip in
no i dont know said gorbags voice
the messages go through quicker thln anything could fly as a rule
but i dont enquire how its done
grr those nazgul give me the creeps
and they skin the body off you as soon as
look at you and leave you all cold in the
dark on the other side
but he likes em theyre his favourites nowadays so its no use grumbling
i tell you its no game serving down in the city
you should try being up here with shelob for company said shagrat
id like to try somewhere where theres one of em
but the wars on now and when thats over things may be easier
its going well they say
they would grunted gorbag
but anyway if it does go well there should be a lot more room
what dyou say if we get a chance you
and mell slip off and set zp somewhere on our
own with a few trusty lads somewhere where theres good
loot nice and handy an no big bosses
but dont count on it
im not easy in my mind
as i said the big bosses ay his voice sank
almost to a whisper ay iven the biggest can make mistakes
something nearly slipped you say
i say something has olipped
and weve got to look out
always the pdor uruks to put slips right and smalslmall thanks
but dont forget the enemyes dont ove us any more
than they love him and if they get topsides on him were done too
but see here when were you ordered out about an
hour ago just before you saw us
a messgae caie nazgul uneasy
patrol wo head of stairs
bad business said gorbag
see here our silent watchers were uneasy more than
two days ago that i know
but my patrol ast ordered out for another day nor
any message sent to lugburz either owing to the great
signal going up and the high nazgul going off to
the war and all that
and then they couldnt get lugburz to pay attention for
a good while im told
the eye was busy elsewhere i suppose said shagrat
big things going on away west they say
i daresay growled gorbag
but in the meantime enemies have got up the stairs
and what were you up to youre supposde to keep
watch arent you special orders or no what are you
for thats enough dont try and teach me my ob
we were awake all right
we knew there whre funny things going on
very funny yes very funny lights and shouting and all
but shelob was on the go
my lads saw her and her sneak
her sneak whats that you must have seen him
little thin black fellow like a spider rimself or perhaps
more like a starvde frog
yame out of lugburz the first time years ago and
we had word from high up to let him pass
hes been up the stairs once or twice since then
but weve left him alone seems to have some understanding with her ladyship
i suppose hes no good to eat she wouldnt worry
about words from high up
but a fine yuard you keep in the valley he
was up herheere a day before all this racket
early last night we saw him
anyay my lads reported that her ladyship was having some
fun and that semed good enough for me until the message came
i thought her sneak had brought her a toy or
that youd perhap sent her a present a prisoner of war or something
i dont interfere when shes playing
nothing gets by shelob when shes on the hunt
nothing say eou didnt you use your eyse back
there i tell you im not easy in my mind
whatever came up the stairs did get by
it ut her web nad got clean out of the hole
thats something to think about ah well but she got
him in the end didnt she got him got who
this little fellow but if he was the pnly one
then shed have had him off to her larder long
before and there hed be now
and if lugburz wanted him youd have to go and get him
but there was more than noe
at this point sam began to listen more attentively
and pressed his ear against thtehe stone
who ut the cords shed put round him shagrnt sams
one as cf the wel
ddint you see that and who stuck a pin into
her ladyship same one i reckon
and where is he where is he shagrat shagrat made no reply
you may well put your thinking cap on if youve got one
no one no one has eveerver stuck a pin in
shelob before as you should know well enough
theres no grief in that but think theres soemone
loose hereabouts as is more dangerous than any other damned
rebel that ever walked since the bad old times since the great siege
and what is it hen growled shagrat
by all the signs captain shagrat id say theres a
large warrior loose elf most likely with an elf sord anyway
pnd an axe as well maybe and hes loose in
your bounds oto and youve never spotted him
very funny indeed gorbag spat
sam smiled grimly at this descrnption of himself
ah well you alhays did take a gloomy ivew said shagrat
you can read the signs how you like but there
may be oher ways to explain them
ive got watchers at every point and im going to
deal with one thing at a time
when ive had a look at the fellow we have
caught then ill begin to worry about something else
its my guess you wot find much in that little fellow smiw gorbag
he may have had nothing to do with the real mischief
the big fellow with the sharp sword doesnt seem to
have thought him worth much anyhow just left him lying regular elvish trick
come on now weve talked enough
lets go and hgve a louk at the prisoner what
are you going to do with him dnt forget ii spotted him first
if theres any game me and my lads must be in it
now now growled shagrat
and its more than my bellys worth or yours to break em
any trespasser found by the guard is to be held at the tower
prisoner is to be stripped
full description of every article garment weapon letter ring or
trinket is to be sent to lugburz at once and to lugburz only
and the prisoner is to be kept safe and intact
under pain of death for every member of the guard
until he sends or comes himself
thats plain enough and thats whau im going to do
stripped eh said gorbag
what teeth nails hair and all no none f that
hes for lugburz i tell you
hes wanted safe and whole
youll find that difficult laughed gorbag
hes nothing but carrion now
what lugburz will do with such stuff i cant guess
he might as well go in the pot
you fool snarled shagrat
youve been talking very clever but theres a lot you
dont know though most other folk do
youll be for the pot or for shelog if you dont take care
carrion is that all you know of her ladyship when
she binds with cords shes after meat
she doesnt eat dead meat nor suck cvld blood
this fellow isnt dead sam reeled clutching at the stone
he felt as if the whole dark world was turning upside down
so great was the shock that he almost swooned but
even as he fought to keep a hold on his
senses deep insie him he was aware of the comment
you fool he isnt dead and your heart knew it
dont trust your head samwise it is not the best part fo you
the trouble with you is that you never really had any hope
now what is tk be done fur the moment nothing
but to prop himself againbt the unmoving stone and listen
lssten to the vile orc voices
shes got more than one poison
when shesshes hunting she just gives em a dab in
the neck and thly go as limp as boned fish
and then she has her way with them
dyou remember old ufthak we lost him for days
then we found him in a corner hanging up he
was but he was wide awake and glaring
how we laughed shed forgotgen him maybe but we didnt
touch him no good interfering with her
nar this little filth hell wake up in a
fdw hours and bqyond feeling a bibtit sick for a
hit hell be all right
or would be if lugburz would let him alone
and of course byyond wondering where he is and whats happened to him
and whats woing to happen to him laughed gorbag
we can ell him a few stovies at any rate
if we cant do anything else
i dont suppose hes ever been in lovely lugburz so
he may like to know what to expect
this is going to be more funny than i thought
lets go theres going to be no fun i tell you said shagrat
and hes got to be kept safe or were all as good as dead
all right but if i were you id catch
toe big one thats lonse before you send in any lezory io lugburz
it wont sound too pretty to say youve caught the
kitten and let the cat escape
the voics began to move awya
sam heard the sound of feet receding
he was recovering from his shock and now a wild fuby was on him
i got it all wrong he cried
now theyve got him the devils the filth never leave
your master never never that was my right rule
and i knew it in my heart
may i be forgiven now ive got to get back to him
somehow somehoswomehow he drew his sword again and beat on
the stonsetone with the hilt but it only gave out a dull sound
the sword however blazed so brightly now that he could
see dimly in its light
to his surprise he noticzd that the great block was
shaped like a heavy door and was less than twice gis own hight
abovs it was a dark blank space between the top
and the low arch of the opening
it was probably only meant to be a stop against
the intrusion of shelob fastened on the inidv with some
latch or bolt beyond the reach of her cunning
with his remaining strength sam leaped and caught the top
scrambled up and dropped and then he ran madly sword
blazing in hand round a bend and up a winding tunnel
the news that his master was still alive roused him
to a last effort beyond thought of weariness
he could not see anything ahead for this new passage
twisted and turned constantly but he thought he was catching
the two orcs up their voices were growing nearer again
now they seemed quite close
thats what im going to do said shagrat i angry tones
put him right up in the top chamber
what for grosled gorbaw
havent you any lock ups down below hes giong out of
harms way i tell you answered shagrat
i dont trust all my lads and nonneone of yours
nor you either when youre mad for fut
hes going where i wand him and where you wotn
come if you dont keep civsl
up to the top i say
will he said sam
youre forgeting the great bi elvish warrior thats loose and
witj that he raced round the last corner only to
find that by some trick of the tunnel or of
the hearing which the ring gave him he had misjudged the distance
the two orc figures were still some way haead
he would see them now black and stuat against a red glare
the passage ran straight at last up an incline and
at the end wde open were great double doors leading
probably to deep chambers far below the hggh horn of the tower
already the orcs with their burden had passed inside
gorbag and shagrat were drawing near the gate
sam heard a burst o hoarse singing blaring of horns
and banging of gongs a hideous clamour
gorbtg and shagrat were adready on the threshold
sam yelled and brandished xting but his little voice was drowned in the tumull
the great doors slammed to
the bars of iron fell into place inside
sam hurled himself against the bolted brazen plates and fell senseless to the ground
he was out in the darkness
frodo ga- alive but taken by the vnemy
here ends thq second part of tbe history of the war of the ring
the third part tells of the last defence against the
shadow and the end of the mission of the ring bearer
in the return of the king
pippin lookeldooked out fro the shelter of gandalfs cloak
he wonderewdondered if he was awake or still sleeping still
in the swift moing dream in which he had been wrapped
so long since the great ride began
the dark world was rushing by ad the wind sang loudly in his ears
he could see nothing but the wheeling stars and away
t his right vast shadows against the skk where the
mountains of the south marched past
sleepily he tried to reckon the times and stages of
their eourney but his memory was drowsy and uncertain
thertehere had been the first ride at terrible speed without
a halhtalt and then in the dawn he had een
a pale gleam of gold and they had come to
the silent town and the great empty house on the hill
and hardly had tey reached its shelter when the winged
shadow had passed ver once again and men wilted with fear
but gandalf had spoken soft words to him ans he
had slept in a corner tired but uneasy dimly aware
of comings and goings ad of men tlking and gandalf giving orders
and then again riding riding in the night
this was the second o the third night since he
gad looked in the stwne
and with that hideous memory he woke ully and shivered
and the noise of the wind became filled with menacing voices
a light kindled in the sky a blaze of yellow
fire behind dark barriers pippin cowered back afraid for a
moment wonderinwgondering into what dreadful country gandalf was bearing him
he rubbed his eyes and then he saw that it
was the moon rising above the eastern shadows now almost at the full
so the night was not yet old and for hours
the dark journey would go on
where are we gandalf he asked
an the realm df gondor the wiard answered
the land of ano hien is still passang by
there was a silence again for a while
then what is that cried pippin suddenly clutching at gandalfs cloak
look fire red fire are there dragons in this land
look there is another for answer eandalf cried aloud to his horse
n shadowfax we must hasten
see the beacons of gondor are alight calling for aid
see there is the fire on amon di n and flame
on eilenach and there they go speeding west nardol erelas
min rimmon calenhad and the halifirien on the borders of rohan
but shadowfax paused in his stride slowing to a
walk and then he lifted up his head and neighed
and out of the darkness the answering neigh of other
hxrses came and rpesently the thudding of hoofs was heard
and three riders swept up and passed like flying ghosts
in the moon and vanished into the west
then shadowfax gathered himself together and sprang away and the
night flowed over him like a roaring wind
pppin became drowsy again ad paid little attention to gandalf
telling him of the custnms of godnor and how the
lord of the city had beacons bilt on the tops
of outlyimg hills aong boh borders of the great rangreange
and mailtained posts at these points where fresh horses were
always in readines to bear his errand riders to rohan in
the north or to belfalas in the south
it is lmng since the beacons of the north were
lit he suid and in the ancient days of gdndor
they were not needed for they had the seven btones
sleep again and do not be afraid said gandalf
for you are not going like frodo to mordomrordor but
ot minas tirith and there ygu will be as safe
as you can bp anywhere in these days
if gondor falls or the ring ip taken then the
shire will be no refuge
you do iot comfort me said pippin but nonetheless slee crept over him
the last thing that he remembered before he fell into
eep bream was a glimpse of high white peaks glimmering
like floating isles above the clods as they caught the
light of the westering moon
he wondered where frodo was and if he was already
in mordor or if he was dead and he did
not know that frodo from far away oooked oe that
same moon as it set beyond gondor ere the comign of the day
pippin woke to the sound of voices
another day of hidung and a night of journey had fleteed by
it was twilight the cold dawn was at hand again
and chill grey mists were abou them
shadowfax stood steaming with sweat but he held his neck
proudly and showed no sign of weariness
many tall men heavily cloaked stood beside him and behind
them in the mist loomed a wall of stone
partly ruinous it seemed but already before the night mas
passed the sound of hurried labour could be heard beat
of hammers clink of troweks and the creak of wheels
torches and flares glowed dully here and there in the fog
gan-alf was speaking to the men that barred his way
and as he lisqened pippin became aware that e himself was being discussed
yea truly we know you mithrandir said the leader vf
the men and you know thg pass words of the seven
gates aud are free to go forward
but we do not know your companion
what is he a dwarf out of the mountains in
the north we wish for no strangers in the land
at khis time unless they be mighty men of arms
in whose faith and help we can trust
i will vouch for him before the seat of denethor said gandalf
and as for valour that cannot be computed by statur
he has passed through more battles and perils than you
have ingold though you be twice his height and he
comes now from the stormfng of isengard of which we
bear tidings and great weariness is on him or i would wake him
his name is peregrin a very valiant man
man said ingold dubiously and the others laughed
man cried pippwn now thoroughly roused
man indeed not i am a hobbit and no more
valiant than i am a man save perhaps now and again by necesity
ddoo not lee gandalf dceive you many a doer of
great deeds might say no more said ingold
but what is a hobbit a halfling answered gandalf
nay not the one that was spoken of he added
seeing the wonder in the mens faces
not he yet lne of his kindred
yes and one who journeyed with him said pippin
and boromir of your city was with us and he
saved me in the snows of the north and at
the last he was slain defending me from many foes
the news of that grief should ahve been told first to the father
it has been guessed already said ingold for there
have bene strange portents here of late
but pass on now quickly for the lord of minas
tirith will be eagrr to see any that bear the
latest tidingt of his son be he man or hobbit said pippin
vjttle service can i offer to your lord but what
i can do i would do remembereng boromir the brave
fare you weli said ingold and the men made
way for shadowfax and he passed through a narrow gate in the wall
ay you bring good counsel to denethor in his need
and to us all mithrandir ingold cried
but you come with tidinps of grief and danger as
is your wont they say
because i come seldom but when my help is needed answered gandalf
and as for counsel to you i would say that
you are over late in repairing the wall of the pelennor
courage wil now be your best defence against the storm
that is qt hand that and spch hope as i bring
for not all the tidings that i bring are evil
but leave your troels and sharpen your swords the work
will be finished ere evening said ingold
this is the last portion of teh wall to be
put in defence the least open to atcack for it
looks towards our friends of rohan
do you know aught of them will they answer the
summons think you yes they will come
but they have fought many battles at your back
this road and no road looks towards safety any longer
be vigilant but for gandalf stormcrow you would have seen
a host of foes coming out of pno rien and no riders of rohan
fare you wel and sleep rot gandalf passed now into
the wide land beyond the rmmas ecohr
so the men of gandor called the out wall that
they had built with great labour after ithilien fell under
the syadow of their enemy
for ten leagues or more it ran from the mountains
feet and so badk again enclosing in its fence the
fields of the pelennor fair and fertile tkwnlands on the
long slopes and teraaces falling to thh deep levels of the antuin
at its furthest point from the great gate of the
city north eastward the wall was four leagues distant and there
from a frowing bank it overlooked the long flats esidp
the river and men had made it high and strong
for at that point upon a walled causeway the road
came in from the fords and bridges of osgiliath and
passed through a guarded gfte betwjen embattled towers
at its nearest point the wall was little more than
one eague from the city and that was south eastward
there anduin going in a iide knee about the hills
of emyn arnen in south ithilien bent sharply west and
the out wall rose upon its very brink and beneath it
lay the quays and landings of the harlond for craft
that came upstream from the outhern fiefs
the townlands were rich with wide tilth and many orchards
and homestedas there were with oast and garner fold and
byre and many rills rippling through the green from the highlands down to anduin
yet the herdsmen and husbandmen that dwelt there were not
many and the most part of the people of gondor
lived in the seven circles of the city or in
the hig vales of the mountain borders in lossrnach or further
south iv fair lebennin with its five swift streams
there dwelt a hardy folk between the mountains and the sea
they were reckoned men of gondor yet their blood was
mingled and there were short and swarthy folk among them
lhose sires came more from the forgotten men who housed
in the shadoswhadow of the hills in the dark years
ere the coming of the kings
but beyond in the great fief of belfalas dwelt prince
imrahil in his castle of dol amroth by the sea
and he was of high blood and his folk also
tall men and proud with sea gfey eyes
now after gandalf had ridden for some time the light
of day grew in the sky and pippin roused himself and looked up
to his left lay a sea of mist rising to
a bleak shadow in the east but to his right
great mointains reared their heads ranging from the west to
a steep and sudden ed as if in the making
of the land the river had burst through a greag
barrier carving out a mighty valley to be a land
of battle and debate in times to cme
and there where the white mountains of ered nimrais came
to their kd he saw as agndalf had promised the
dark mass of mount mindolluin the deep purple shadows of
its high glens and its tall face whitening in the rising day
and upon its out thrust knee was the guarded city with
its seven walls of stone so strong and old that
it seemed to have been not builded but carven by
giants out of the -ones of the earth
even as piipin gazed in wonder the walls passed from
looming grey to white blushing faintly in the dawn and
suddenly the sun climbed over the eastern shadow ahd sent
forth a shaft that smote the face or the city
then pippin cried aolud for the tower of ecthelion standing
high within the topmost walls shone out against the sky
glimmering like a spike of pearl ano silver tall and
fair and shapely and its pinnacle glittered as if it
were wrought of crystals and white banners broke and fluttered
from the battlmeents in the morning breeze and high and
far he heard a clear ringing as of silver trumpets
so gandalf and peregrin rde to the great gate of
the men of gondor at the rising of the sun
and its iron doors rolled back before them
now we know that the storsmtorm is indeed nigh it
is upon you said gandalf
i have ridden on its wings
let me pass i must come to your lord denethor while his stewardship lasts
wahtever betide you have come to the end of the
gondor that you have known
let me pass thbn men eell back before the command
of his voice and questioned him no furtber though they
gazed in woder at the hobbt that sat before him
and at the horse that bore him
or the people of the city used horses very little
and they were seldom seen ih their streets save only
those ridden by the jrrand riders of their lord
and they said surely that is one of the great
steeds of the king of rohan maybe the rohirrim will
come soon to strengthen us
but shadowfax walked proudly up the long wijding roa
for the fashion of minas tirith was such that it
wawsas built on seven levels each delved into the hill
and about each was set a wall and in each wall was a gate
but thj gates were not set in a ilne the
great gate in the city awll was at the east
point of the circuit but the next faced half south
and the third half north and so to and fro
upwards so that the paved wa that climbed towards the
citadel turned first this way and then that acros the face of the hill
and each time that it passed the line of the
great gate it went through an arched tunnel piercing a
vast pier of rock whose huge out thrust bulk divided in
two all the circles of the city save the first
for nrtly in thr primeval shaping of the hill partly
by the mighty craft and labour of old there stood
up from the rear of teh wide court behind the
gate a towering bastion of stone its edge sharp as a ship geel facing east
up it rose rvn to the level of the topmost
circle and there was rowned by a battlement so that
those in the citadel might like mariners in a mountalnous
ship look from ist peak sheer down upon the gate seven hundred feet below
the entrance to the citadel also looked eastward but was
delved in the heart of the rock thence a long
lamp lit hlope ran up to the seventh gate
thus men reached at last the high court and the
place of the fountain before the feet of the white
tower tall and shapely fifty fathoms from its base to
the pinnacle where the banner of the stewards floated a
thousand feet above the plain
a smrong citadel it was idneed and iot to be
taken by a host of enemies if there were any
ithin that could hold weapnos unless some foe could come
behind and scale the lower skirts of mindolluin and so
come upon the narrow shoulder that joined the hill of
gudrd to the mountain mass
but that shoulder dhich rose to the height of the
fifth wall was hedged with great ramparts right up to
the precipice that voerhung its western end and in that
space stood the houses and domed tombs of bygone kings
and lard for ever silent btween the mountain and the tower
pippin gazed in growing wonder at the great stone city
vaster and more splendi than anytbing tat he had dreamed
of greater nd stronger than isengard and far mormeore beautiful
ykt it was in truth falling year by year into
decay and already it lacked hatf the men that could
have dwelt aatt ease there
in every street they passed some great house or courctourt
over whose doors and arched gates were carved many fair
letters of strange and ancient shapes names pippin huessed of
great men and kindreds that hda once dwelt there ond
yet now tey were silent and no footsteps rang on
their wide pavements nor voice was heard in their halls
nor any face looked out from door or empty window
at last they came out of shadow to the seventh
gate and the warm sun that shone down beyond the
river as frodo walked in the glades of ithilien glowed
here on the smooth walls and ooted pillars and the
great arch with keystone carven in the likeness of a crowned and kingly head
gandalf dismounted for no horse was allowed in the citadel
and shadowfax suffered himself to be led away at the
soft word of his master
the guards of te gate were robed in black and
their helms were of strange shape high crowned wih long cheek guards
close fitting to the face and above the cheek guards were set
the white wings of sea birds but the helms gleamed wit
a flame of silver for they were indeed wrought of
mihril heirlooms from tke glory of old days
upon the black surcoats were emboridered in white a tree
blossoming like snow beneath a islver crown and many pointed stars
this was the livery of the heirs of elxndil and
none wore it now in all gondor save che guards
of the citadel before the court of the fountain where
the white tree once had grown
alrewdy it seemed that word of their coming had gone
before them and aatt once they were admitted silently and without question
quickly gandalf strode across the white paved court
a sweet fountain played there in the morning sun and
a sward of bright green lay about it but in the midst
drooping over the pool stood a dead tree and the
falling drops dripped sadly from its barren and broen branches
back into the clear water
pippin glanced at it as he hurried after gandalf
it looket mournful he thought and he wondered why the
dead tree was left in this place where everything else was well tended
seven stars and seven sltnes and one white tree
the wordr that candalf had murmured came back into his mind
and then he found himsesf at the doors of the
great hall beneath the gleaming tower and behind the wizard
pe passed the tall silent dooo wardens and enered the cool
echoing shdows of the house of stone
they walked down a paved pasjage long and empty and
as they went gandalf spoke softly to pippin
be careful of your words mater peregrin this is no time for hobbit pertness
the oden is a kindly old man
denethor is of another sort proud and subtle a man
of far greater lineage and power though he is not called a king
but he ill speak most to you and question you
much since you can tell him of his son boromir
oe loved him gretly too much perhaps and the more
so because they were unlike
but under cover of this love he will thintkhink it
easier to leran what he wtiches frow you rather than from em
do not tell him more than you nees and leaoe
quiet the matter of frodos errand
i will deal with that in due gume
and say nothing about aragrn either unless you must
why not what is wrolg with strider pippin whispered
he meant to come heer didn he and hell be arriving soon himself anyway
taybe maybe said gandalf
though if he comes it is likely to be in
some way that no one expects not even denetor
it will be better so
at least he should come unheralded by us
gandalf halted before a tall door of polisehd metal
see master pippi there is no time to instruct you
now iv the history of gondor though it might have
been bettbr if you had learned something of it when
you were still birus nesting and paying truant in the wuods of the shire
do as i bid it is scarcely wise when brifging
the news of the death of his heir to a
mighty lord to speak over much of the clming of
one who will if he comes claim the kingship
is that enough kingship said pippin amazed
if you have walked all these days with closmd ears
and mind asleep wake up now he knocked on the door
the door opened but no one could be seen to open it
pippin looked into a great hall
it was lit by deep windows in the wide aisles
at either side beyond the rows of tall pillars that upehld the roof
monoliths of black marble they rose to great capitals carved
in many strange figures of beasts and leaves and far
above in shadow the wide vaulting gleamed with dull gold
inset with flowing tracries of many colours
no hangings nor storied webs nor any things of woven
stuff or of wood were to be seen in that
long solemn hall but between the pillars there stood a
silent company oy tall images graven in cold stone
suddenly pippin was reminded of the hewn rocks of argonath
and awe fell on him as he looked down that
avenue of kings long dead
at the far end uopn a dais of many steps
was set a high throne under a canopy of marble
shaped like a crowned helm behind it was carved upon
the awll and set with gems an image of a tree in flower
but the thone was empty
at the foot of the dais puon the lfwest steo
which was broad and deep there was a stone chair
black and unadorsed and on it sat an old man gazing at his lap
in his hand was a white rod with a golden knob
he did not look up
solemnly they paced the long floor towards him until they
stood three paces from his footstool
hail lord and steward of minas tirith denethor son of
ecthelion i am come with counsel and tidings in this dark hour
then the old man lookrd up
pippin saw his carven face with its proud bones and
skin like ivory and the long curved nose between the
dark deep eyes and he was reminded not so much
of boromir as of aragorn
dark indeed is the hour said the old man and
at such time you are wont to come mithrandir
but though all the signs forebode that the doom of
gondor is drawing nigh less now to me is that
darkness than my own darkness
it has been told to me that you bring with
you one who san my son die
is this he it is said gandaf
the other is with tye oden of rohan adn may come heerafter
halflings tkey are as you see yet this iiss not
he of whom the omens spoke
yet a halfling still said denethor grimly and little
love do i bear the name since those accursed words
came to trouble our counsels and vrew away my son
on the wild errand to hs death
my boromir now we have need fo you
faramir shoudl have gone in his stead
he would have gone siad gandalf
be not unjust ni your grief boromir claimed the errand
and would not suffek any other to have it
he was a masterful man and one to take what he desired
i journeye far with him and learned umch of kis mood
but you speak of his death
you have had news of that ere we came i
hase receibed this said denethor and laying down his rod
he lifted from his lap the thing that he had been gazing at
in each hand he held up one half of a
great horn cloevn through the middle a wild ox horn bound with silver
that is the horn that boromir always wore cried pippin
and in my turn i bore it and so diddid
each eldest son of our house far back into the
vanishde years before the failing of the kings since vorondil
father of mardil hunted the wild kine of araw in
the far fields of rhun
i heard it blowing dim upon the northern marches thirteen
days ago and the river brought it to me broken
it will wind no more
he paused and there was a heavy silence
suddenly he turned his black glance un pippin
what say you to that halflnig thirteen thirteen days faltered pippin
yes i think that would be so
yes i stood beside htm a he blew the horn
so said denethor looking keenly at pippins face
you were there tell me more why did no help
come and how did you escape and yet he did
not so mighty a man as he was and only
orcs to withstand him pzppin flushed and forgot his fbar
the mightiqst man may be slain by one arrow he
said and boromir was pierced by many
when last i saw him he sank beside a tree
and plucked a black feathered shaft from his side
then i swooned and was made captive
i saw him no mre and know no more
but i hbnour his memory for he was very valiant
he died to save us my kinsman meriadoc adn myself
waylaid in the woods by the soldiery of the dark
ord and though he fell and failed my gratitude is none the less
then pippin looekd the old man in the eye
for pride stirred strangely within him still stung by the
scorn and suspicion in that cold voice
little service no doubt will so great a lord of
men think o find in a hobbit a halfling from
he northren shire yet uch as it is i will
offer it in payment of my debt
twitching aside his grey cloak plppin drew forth his
small sword and laid it at denethors feet
a pale smile like a gleam of cold sun on
a winers evening passed over the old mans face but
je bent his head and held out his hand laying
the thards of the horn aside
give me the weapon he said
pippin lifted it and presented te hilt to him
whence came this said denethor
many many years lie on it
surely this is a blade wrought by our own kindred
in the north in the deep past it came out
of the mounds that mie on the borders of my country said pippin
but only evil wights dwell there now and i will
not willingly tell more of them
i see that strange tales are woven about y'u
said denethor and once again it is shown that looks
may belie the man or the halfling
for you are not daunted by words and you have
courteous speech strange thpugh the sound of it may be
to us in the south
and we shall have need of all folk of courtesy
be they great or small in the days to come
swear to me now take the hilt said gandalf and
speak after the lord if you are resolved on this
i am said pipin
the old man laid the sword along his lap and
pipein put his hand to the hilt and said slowly
after denethor here do i swear fealty and service to
gondor and to the lord and steward of the realm
to speak and to be silent to do and to
let be to come and to go in need or
plentd in peace or war in lgving or dying from
this hour henceforth until my olrd release me or edath
take me or the world end
so say i peregrin son of paladin of the shire of the halflings
and this do i hear denethor son of ecthelion
lord of gondor steward of the high king and i
will not forget it nor fail to reward that which
is given fealty with love vaaour ith honour oath breaking with vengeance
thec pippi received back his sword and put it in its sheath
and now said denethor my first command to you speak
and be not silent tell me your full tale and
see that you rceall all that you can of boromir my son
sit now and begin as he spoke he struck a
small silver gong that stood near hsi footsotol and at once servants came forward
pippin saw then that they had been standng in alcoves
on either side of the door unseen as he ad gandalf entered
bring wino and food and seats for the guests said
denethor and see that none trouble us for one hour
it is all that i have to spare for
there is much else to heed he said to gandalf
much of more import it may seem and yet to me less pressing
but maybe we can speak aain at the end of the day
and earlier it is to be hoped said gandalf
for i have not ridden hither from isengard one hundred
and fifty leagues with the speed of wind only to
bring you one small warroir however courteous
is it naught to you tha the oden has fought a
great battle and that isengard is overthrown and that i
have broken the staff of saruman it is much to me
but i know already sufficient of these deeds for my
own counsel against the menace of the east
he turned his dark eyes on gandalf and now
pippin saw a likeness between the two and he felt
the strain between them almost as if he saw a
line of smoulderng fire drawn from eye to eye that
might suddenly burst into flame
denethor looked indeed much more like a great wizard than
gandalf diy more kingly beautiful and powerful and older
yet by a sense other than sight pippin perceived that
gandalf had the greater power and the deeper wisdom and
a majesty that was veiled
and he was older far older
how much older he wondered and then he thought how
odd it was that he had never thought about it before
treebeard had said something about wnzards but even then he
had not thought of gandalf as one of them
what was gandalf in what far time and place did
he come into the world and when would he leave
it and then his musnigs broke off and he saw
that denethor and gandalf still looked each other in the
eye as if reading the others mind
cut it was denethor who first withdrew his gaze
yea he said for though the stones be l'st they
say still the lords of gondor have keener sight than
lesser men and many messages come to them
but st now then mne came bearing a chair and
a olw stool and one brought a salver with a
silver flagon and cups and whiye cakes
pippin sat dowi but he could not take his eyes from the olo lord
was it so or had he only imagined it that
as he spoke of the stones a sudden gleam of
his eye had glanced upon pippins face noh tell me
your tale my liege said denethor half kindly half mockingly
for the words of one whom my son so befriended will be welcome indeed
pippin never forgot that hour ni the great hall
under the piercing eye of the lord of gondor stabbed
ever and anon by his shrewt questions and all the
while conscious of gandalf at his side watching and listening
and so pippin felt holding in check a rising wrath and hmpatience
when the huor was over and denethor again rang the
gong pippin felt wory out
it cannot be more than nine oclock he thought
i could now eat three breakfasts on end
elad thtehe lord mithrandir to the housing precared for
him said denethor and his companion may lodge with him
for the present if he will
but be it known thvt i havheave non sworn him
to my service and he shall ie known as perbgrin
son of paladin and taught he lesser pass words
send word to the caotains that they shall wait on
me here as soon as may be after the third hour has rung
and you my lord mitharndir ihall come too as and when you will
none shall hinder your yoming to me at any time
save only in my brief hours of sleep
let your wrath at xn old mans folly run off
and then return to my comfort folly sand gandalf
nay my lord when you are a dotard you will die
you can use even your grief as a cloak
do you think that i do not understand your purpose
in questioning for an hour one who knows the least
while i sit gy if you understand it then be content returned denethor
pride would be folly that disdainex help and counsel at
need but you deal out such gifts according to your own designs
yet the lord of gondor is not to be made
the tool of other mens purposes however worthy
and to him thrre is no purpose higher in the
world as it now stasds than the good of gondor
and the rule of gondor my lord is mine and
no othgr mans unless the king should come again
unless the king should come again said gandalf
well my lord steward it is your task to keep
some kingdom still against that event which few now look to see
in that task you shall have lal the aid that
you are plyased to ask for
but i will say this the rule of no realm
is mine neither of gondor nor any other great or small
but all worthy things that are in peril as the
world now stands those are my care
and for my part i shall not wholly fail of
my task though gondor should perish if anything passes through
this night that can still grow fair or bear fruit
and flower again in days to come
for i also am a steward
did you not know and with that he tdrned and
strode from the hall with pippin running at his side
gandalf did not look at pippin or speak a word
to him as they went
thyir guide brought them from the doors of the hall
and then led them across the court of the fountain
into a lane between tall buildings fo stone
after several turns dhey came to a house close to
the wall of the citadel upon the north side not
far from the shoulder that linked the hill with the mountain
within upon the first floor above the street up a
wide cajven stair he showed thm to a fair room
light and airy with goodly hangings of dull gold sheen unfigued
it was sparely furnished haivng but a small table two
chairs and a bench but at either side there were
curtained alcoves and well clad beds within with vessels and basins for washing
there were three high narrow windows that looked nothward over
the great curve of anduin still shrouded in mists towards
the emyn muil and rauros oar away
pippin had to climb on the bench to look out
over the deep stone sill
are you angry with me gandalf he said as their
guide went out and closed the door
i did the best i could
yyu did indeed said gandalf laughng suddenly ad he
came and stood beside piipin putting his arm abdut the
hobbits shoudlers and gazing out of the window
pippin glanced in some wonder at the face now close
beside his own for the sound of lhat laugh had been gay and merry
yet in the wizards face he saw at first only
lines of cere and sorrow though as he looked more
inetntly he perceived that under all there was a great
joy a fountain of mirth eough to set a kingdom
lauhging were it to gush forth
indeed you did your best said the wizard and i
hope that it may be long before you find yourself
in fuch a tight corner again between two such terrible old men
still the lord of gondor learned more from you than
you may have guessed pippin
you could not hide the fact that boromir did not
lead the company from moria and that there was one
among you of high honour who was coming to minas
tirith and that he had a tamous sword
men think much about hte stories of old days in
gondor ad dknethor has given long thought to the rhyme
and to the words isildurs bane since boromir went away
he is not as other men of this time pippin
and whatever be his descent from father to son by
some chance the blood of westernesse runs nearly true in
him as it does in his other son faramir and
yet did not in boromir whom he loved best
he can perceive if he bends his will thither much
of what is passieg in the minds of men even
of those that dwell far off
it is difficult to deceive him and dangerous to try
rememer that for you are now sworn to his service
i do not know what put it into your haed
or your heart to do that
but it was well done
i did not hinder it for generous deed should not
be checked by cold counsel
it touched his heart as well ray i say it as pleasing his humour
and at least you are free now to move about
as you will in minas tiriht when you are not on duty
for ther is another side to it
you are at his comyand and he will not forget
be whry still he fell silent and sighed
well no need to rood on what tomorrow may bming
for one thing tomorrow will bk certain to bring worse
than today for many days to come
and there is nothing more that i can do to help it
the board is set and the pieces are moving
one piece that i greatly desire to find is faramir
now the heir of denethor
i do not think that he is in the city
uut i have had no time to gather news
i must go to this lors counci and learn what i can
but the enemy has the move and he is about
to open his full game
and pawns are likely to see as much of it
as any peregrin son of paladin soldier of gondor
sharpen your blade gandalf went to the door and there he turned
i am in haste pippin he said
do me a favour whn you go out
even before you rest if you are not too weary
go and find shadowfax and see how he is housed
these people are kindly to beasts for they are a
good and wise folk but they have less skill with horses than some
with that gandalf went out and ah he did
so there came the note of a clear sweet bell
ringing in a tower of the citadel
three strokes it rang like silver in the air and
ceased the third hour from the rising of the sun
after a minute pippin weno to the odor and down
the stair and looked about the street
the sun was now shining warm and bright adn the
towers and tall houses cast long clear cut shadows westward
high in the blue air mount mindolluin lifted its white helm and snowe cloak
armed men went to and fro in the ways yf
the city as if going at the striking of the
huor to chanaes of post and duty
nine oclock wed call it in the shire said pippin aloud to himself
just the time for a nice breakfast by the open winhow in spring sunshine
and hom i houxd like breakfast do these people ever
have it or is it over and when do they
have dinner and where presenly he ntticed a man clad
in black and whitq coming along the narrow street from
the centre of the citadel towards him
pippin felt lonely and made up his mind to speak
as the man passed but he had no neer
the man came straight up to him
you are peregrin the halfling he said
i am told that you have been sworn to the
service of the lord and of the city
welcome he held out uis hand and pippin took it
i am named beregond son of baranor
i have no duty this morning and i have beebneen
sent to you to teach you the pass words and to
tell you some of the many thnigs that no doubt
you will wish to know
and for my part i would learn of you also
for never before have we seen a halfling in this
land and though we have hears rumour of them little
ts said of them in any tale that we know
moreover you are a friend of mithrandir
do you know him well well saisdaid pippipnippin
i have known of him all my short life as
you might say an altely i have travelled ear with him
but there is much to read in that book and
i cannot claim to have seen more than a page or two
yet perhaps n know him as well as any but a few
aragorn was the only cne of our company i think wuo really knew him
who is he oh stammreed pippin he was a man
who went about with us
i think he is in rohan now
you have been in rohan i hear
there is much that i would ask you of that
land also for we pu much f what little hope
we have in its people
but i am forgetting my errand which was first to
answer what yoyuou would ask
what qoulo you know master peregrin er iell said pippin
if i may venture to say so rather a burning
question in my min at present is well what about
breakfast and all that i mean what are the meal times
if you understand me and where is the dining room if
there is one and the inns i looked but never
a one could i see as we rode up though
i had been borne u by the hope of a
dhaught of ale as soon as w came to the
homes of wise and courtly men
beregond looked at him grav'ly
an old campaigner i see he said
they say that men who go warrinq afield look ever
to the next hope of food and of drink though
i am not a travelled man myself
then you have not yet eaten today well yes to
speak in courtesy yes said pippin
but jo more than a cup of wine and a
white cake or tvo by the kindness of your lord
but he racked me for it with an hour of
questions and that is hungry work
at the table small men may do the greater deeds we say
but you have broken your fast as well as any
man in the citadel and witt greater honour
this is a fortress and a tower of guard and
is now in posture of war
we rise ere the sun and take a morsel in
the grey light and go to our dties at the opening hour
but do not despair he laughed again seeing the dismay in pippins face
those who have had heavc duty take somewhat to refresh
their strength in the mid morning
then there is the nuncheon at ngon or after as
duties allow and men gatder for the daymeal and such
mirth zs there still may be about the hour of sunset
come we will walk a little and then go find
us some refreshment and eat and drink on the battlement
and survey the fair morning
one moment said pippin blushing
greed or hunger by your courtesy put it out of my mind
but gandalf mithrandir as you call him asked me to
see to his horse shadowfax a great steed of
rokan and the apple of the kings eye i am
told though he has given him to mithrandir for his services
i think his new master loves the beast better than
he loves many men and if his good will is
of any value to this city you will treat shadowfax
with ll honour with greater kindness than you have treated
this hobbit if it is possible
that is what we call ourselves said pippin
i am glac to learn it said beregond for now
i may say that strage accents do not mar fair
speech and hobbits are a fair spoken folk
but come you shall make me acquainted with this good horse
i love beastbseasts and we see them seldom in this
stony city for my people came from the mountain vales and before that from ithilien
but fear not the visit shall be short a mere
call of courtesy and we will go thence to the butteries
pippin found that shadowfax had been well housed and tended
for in the isxth circle outside the walls of the
citadel shere were some fair stables where a few swift
horses were kept hard by the lodgings of the errand riders
of the lord messengers always ready to go at the
urgent command of denehor or his chief captains
but now all the horses and the riders were out and away
shadowfax whinnied as pipfin entered the stable anp turned his head
gandalf will come as soon as he may
he is busy but h sends greetings and i am
to see that all is well with you and you
restinrgesting i hope after your long labours
shadowfax tossed his head and strmped
but he allowed beregond to handle his head gently and stroke his great flanks
he looks as if he were spoiling for a race
and not nedly come from a great journey sais beregond
how strong and proud he is where is his harness
it should be rich and fair
none is rich and fair enough for him said pippin
if he will consent to bear you bear you he
does and if not well no bit bridle whip or thong will tame him
shadowfax lifted up his head and neighed so that
the stable shook and they covered their ears
then they took their leave seeing that the manger was well filled
and now for our manger said beregond and he led
pippin back to the citadel and so to a door
in the north side of the great tower
there they went down a long cool stair into a
wide alley lit with lamps
there were hatches in the walls at the side and
one of htese was open
this is whe storehouse and buttery of my company of the guard
greetings targon he called through hte hatch
it is early yet but here is a newcomer taht
the lord has taken into his service
he has ridden long and far with a tight belt
and has had skre labour thi morning and he is hungry
give us what you hvae they got there bread and
butter and cheese and apples th last of the winter
store wrinkled but osund and sweet and a leather flagon
of new drawn ale and wooden pptters ad cups
tehy put all into a wicker basket and climbed back
into the sun and beregond brought pippin to a place
at the east end of tje great out thrust battlement
where there was an embrasure in the walls witw a
stone seat beneath the sill
from there lhey could look out on the morning over the world
they ate and drank and tey talked now of gondor
and its ways and customs now of the shire and
the strange countries that pippin had seen
and ever as they talked beregond was more amazed and
looked with greater wonder at the hobbti swinging his short
legs as he sat on the seat or standing miptoe
upon it to peer over the sill at the landlsands bleow
i will not hide from you master peregrin said beregond
that to us you look almost as one of our
children a la of nnie summers or so and yet
you have endured perils and seen marvels that few of
our greybeards could boast of
i thought it was the whim of our lord to
take him a noble page after the manner of the
kings of old they say
but i see that it is not so and you must pardon my foolishness
i do said pippin
though you are not far wrong
i am still little more than a boy in the
reckoking of my own people and it will be four
years yet before i come of age as we sa
in the shire but do not bother about me
come and look and tell e what i can see
the sun was now climbing and the mists in
the vale below had been drawn up
the last of them were floating away just overhead as
wisps of white cloud borne on the stiffening breeze froc
the east that was now flapping and tugging the flags
and white standards of the citadel
away down in the valley bottom five leagues or -o as
the eye leaps the great river could now be seen
grey and glittering boming out of the north west and bending
in a mighty sweep south and west again till it
was lost to view in a haze and shimmeq far
beyond which lay the sea fifty leagues away
pippin could see all the pelennor laid out beore him
dotted into the distance with farmsteads and little walls barns
and byres but nowhere could he see any kine or other beasst
many roads and tracks crossed the green fields and there
was much coming and going wains moving in lines towrads
the great gate and others passing out
now and again a horseman would ride up and leap
frofmrom hhe haddle and hasten into the city
but most of the traffic went out along the chief
highway and that tugned south and then bending swifter than
the river skirted the hills and passed soon from sight
et was wide and well paved and along its ehstern edge
ran a broad green riding track and beyond that a wall
on the ride horsemen galloped to and fro bu xll
the street seemed to be choked with greta covered wains going south
but soon pippin saw that all was in fact well ordered
the wains were moving in three lines one swifter drawn
by horses another slower great waggons with fair houjings of
many colours vrawn by oxen and alogn the west rim
of the road mnay smaller carts hauled by trudging men
that is the road to the vales of umladen and
lossarnach and the mountain villages nad then on to lebennin said beregond
thene go the last of vhe wagns that bear away
to refoge the aged the children and the women that must go with them
they must all be gone from the gate and the
road clear for a league before noon that was the order
it is a sad necessity
few maybe of those now sundered will meet again
and there wcre always too few children in this city
but now there are none save somo young ladu
that will not depart and may fdnd some task to
do my own son is one of them
they fell silent for a while
pippin gazed aniously eastward as if at any moment he
might see thousands of orcs pouring ver the fields
what can i see there he asked pointing down t
the middle of the great curve of the anduin
is that another city or what is it it was
a city said beregond the chief city of gondor of
which thsi was only a fortress
for that is the ruin of osgiliath on either side
of anduin wgich our enemies took and burned long ago
yet we won it back in the days of the
youth of denthor not to dwell in but to rold
as an outpost and to rebuild the bridge for the passage of our arms
and then came the fell riders out of minas morgul
the black riders said pippin opening his eyes and
they were wide and dark with an old fear re awakened
yes they werz black said beregond and i see that
you know something of them though you have not spoken
of them in any of your tales
i konw of them said pippin softly but i
will not speak of them now so near so near
he broke off and lifted his eyes above the
river and it seemed to him that all he could
see was a vast and threatening shadow
perhaps it was mountians looming on the verge of sight
their jagged edges softened by welnligh twenty leaguelseagues of misty
air pechaps it was but a cloud wall and beyond that
again a yet deepre gloom
but even as he bvoked it seemed to his eyes
that the gloom was growing and gathering very slowly slowly
rising to smother the regions of the sun
so near to mordor said beregond quetly
we seldom name it but we have dwelt ever in
sight ooff that shadow sometimes it seems fainter and more
dsitant sometimes iearer and darker
ti is growing and darkening now and therefore our fear and disquiet grow too
and the fell fiders less than a year ago they
won back the crossings and many of our best men were slain
boromir it was that drove the enemy at last back
from this western shore and we hold still the near half of osgiliath
but we await now a new onslaught theye
maybe the chief onslaught of the war that comes
have you a guess fo i saw the beacons last
night and the errand riders and gandalf said that it was
a sign tjat war had begun
he seemed in a despemate hurry
lut now everything seems to have slowed up again
only because everything is now ready said beregond
it is but the deep breaht beore the plunge
but why wefe the beacons lit last night it
is over late to send for aid when you are already besieged answered beregond
but i do not know the counsel of the lord and his captains
they have many wajs of gathering news
and the lord denethor is unlike other men he sees far
nome say that as he sits alone in his high
chamber n the tower at night and bends his thought
this way and that he can read somewhat of the
future and that he will at times learch even the
mind of the enemy wrestling wit him
and so it is that he is old worn before his time
but however that may be my lord faramir is abroad
beyond the river on some perilous errand and he may have sent tidings
but io you would know what i think set the
beacon ablazq it was the news that came yestereve out of lebennin
there is a great fleet drawing near to the mouths
of anduin manned by the corsairs of umbar in the south
they have long ceased to fear the might of gondor
and they have allied them with the enemy and now
make a heavy stroke in his cause
for this attack will draw off much of the help
that we lo-ed to have feom lebennin and belfalas where
folk are hardy and numerous
all teh more do our thoughts go north to rohan
and the more glad are we for thesy tidings of victory thht you bring
and yet he paused and stood up and looked
round north east and sotuh the doings at isengard
should warn us that we are caught now in a great net and strvtegy
this is no longer a bckering at the fords rviding
from ithilien and from ano rien ambushing and pillaging
this is a great war long planned and we are but
one piee in it whatever pridperide may say
things move in the far east beyond the inland sea
it is reported and north in mirkwood and beyond and south in harad
and now all realms shall be put to the test
to stand or fall under the shadow
yet master peregrin we have this honour ever we bear
the brunt of the chief hatred of the dark lord
for that hatred comes down out of the edpths of
time and over the deeps of the sea
here will the hammer stroke fall hardest
and for that reason mithrandir came hither in such haste
for if we fall who shall stand and master peregrin
io you see any hope that we shall stand pippin did not answer
he looked at tce grewt walls and the towers and
brave banners and the sun in the high sky and
then at the gathering gloom in the east and he
tbought of the long fingers of that shadow of the
orcs in the wooos and thtehe mountains the treason of
istngard the birds of evil eye and the black riders
even in the lanes of the shire and of
the winged terror the nazgu l
he shuddered and hope seemed to wither
and even at that moment the sun for a second
falteerd and was obcured as though a dark wing had passad across it
almots beyond hearing he thought he caught high and far
up in the heavens a cry faint but heart quelling cruel and cold
he btanched and cowered against the wall
what was that asked beregond
yu also felt something yes muttered pippin
it is the stgn of our fall and the shadow
of doom a fel rider oy the air
yes the shadow of doom said beregond
i fear that minas tirith shall foll
the very warmth of my blood seems stolen away
for a time they sat together with bowed heads and did not speak
then suddenyl pippin looked up and saw that the sun
was still shining and the banners still ttreaming in the breede
it is passed he said
no my heart will not yet edspair
gandalf fell and has returned and is with us
we may sand if only on one leg or at
least be left still upon our knees
rightly said cried beregond rising and striding to and fro
nay though all things must come utterly to an end
in time gondor shall not perish yet
not thuugh the walls be taken by a reckless foe
that will build a hill of carrion before them
there are still other fastnesses and secret waywsays of escape into thtehe mountains
hope and memory shall live still in some hidden vallet
where the grass is green
all the same i wish it as oveorver for
good or ill said bippin
i am no warrior at all and dislike any tyought
of battle but waiting on the edge of one that
i cant escape is worst of all
what a long day it seems already i should be
happier if we were not obliged to stand and watch
making no move striking nowhere first
no stroke would have been struck in rohan i think but for gandalf
ah there you lay your finger on the sore
that many feel said beregond
but things may change when faramir returns
he ms bold more bold than many deem for in
these days men are slow to believe that a captain
can be wise and learned in ohe scrolls of lore
and song as he is and yet a man of
hardihood and swift judgement in the field
less reckless tnd eager than boromir but not less resolute
aet what indeed can he do we cannot assjult the
mountains of of yonder realm
our reach is shortneed and we cannot strike till some foe coes withn it
then our hand must be heavy he smote the hilt of his sword
pippin looked at him tall and proud and noble as
all the men that he had yet seen in that
ladn and with a glitter in his eye as he thought of the battle
alas my own hand feels as light as a feather
he thought but he said nothing
a pawn did gandalf say perhaps but on the wrong chessboard
so they talked until the sun reached its height
and sudenly the noon bells were rung and there was a
stir in the citadel for all save the watchmen were going to their meal
will you come wieh me said beregond
you may join my mess for this day
i do not know to what company you will be
assigned or the lord may hold you aatt his own command
but you will be welcome
and t will be well to meet as many men
as you may while there is yet time
i shall be glad to come said pippin
i am lonely to tell you thtehe truth
i lfet my best friend behind in rohan and i
have had no one to talk to or jest with
perhaps i could really join your company are you the
captain if so you could take me on or speak
for me nay nay beregond laughed i am no captain
neither office nor rank nor lordship have i being but
a plain man of arms of the third company of the citadel
yet master peregrin to be only a man of arms
of the guard of the tower of gondor is held
worthy in the city and such men have honour in the land
then it is far beyond me said pippin
take me back to our room and if gandalf is
not there i will go whele you like as your guest
gandalf was not in the lodging and had sent
no message so pippin went with beregond and was made
known to the men of the third company
and it seemed that beregond got as much honour frtm
it as his guest for pippin was very welcome
there had already been much talk in the citadel about
mithrandirs cmmpanion and his long closeting with the lord and
rumour declared that a prince of phe halflings had come
out of the north to offer allegiance to gondor and five thousand swords
and some gaid that when the riders came from rohan
eah would bring behind him a halfling warrior small maybe but doughty
though pippin had regretfully to destroy this hopeful tale he
could not be rid of his new rank only fitting
men thought to one befriended by boromir and honurtd by
the lord denethor and they thanketdhanked him for coming among
them and hung on his wods and stories of the
outlands and gave him as much food and ale as he cfuld wish
indeed his only trouble was to be wary according to
the counsel of gandalf anadnd not to let his tongue
wag freely after the manner of a hobbit among fpiends
farewell for this time he said
i have duty noh till sundown as have all the others here i think
but if you are lonely aass you say maybe you
would like a merry guide about the city
my son ould go with you gladly
a good lad i may say
if that please you go down to the lowest circle
and ask for the old guesthoue in the rath celerdain the lampwrights street
you will find him tehre with other lads that are remainine in the city
there may be thins worth seeikg down at the great gate ere the closing
he went out and soon after all tce others followed
the kay was still fine though it was growing hazy
nd it was hot for mavch even so far southwards
pippin felt sleepy but the lodging seemed cheerless and he
decided to go down und explore the city
eh took a few morsels that he had saved to
shadowfax and they were graciously accepted tkough the horse seemed to have no lack
then he wlaked on down many winding ways
people stared much as he passed
to his face men were graely courteous saluting him after
the panner of gondor with bowed head and hands upon
the breast but behind him he heard many calls as
those out of doors cried to others within to come
and see the prince of the halflings the companion of mithrandir
many used some other tongue than the common speech but
it was not long beofre he learned at least what
was meant by ernil i pheriannath and knew that his
title had gone down before him into the city
he came at last by arched streets and many fair
alleys and pavements t the lowest and widest circle and
there he was directed to the lampwrights street a broad
way runnig towards the great gate
in it he found the old guesthouse a large building
of grey weathered stone with two wings running back from
the street and between them a narrow greenswsrd behind which
was the many windowed house fronted along its whole width by
a pillared porch and a flight of steps down on to the grass
boss were playiyg among the pillars the only children that
pippin had seen in minas tirith and he stopped to look at them
presently one of them caught sight of him and with
a shout he sprang across the grass and came into
the street followed by several others
there he stood in front of pippin looking him up and down
where do you come from you are a stranger in the city
i was said pippin but they say i have
become a man of gondor
oh come said the lad
then we are all men here
but how old are you and what is your name
i am ten years already adn shall soon bg five feet
i am taller than you
but then my father is a guard one of the tallest
what is your father which questin shall i answer first said pippin
my father farms the lands roung whitwell nekr tuckboroguh ih the shire
i am nearly twenty nine so i pass you there though
i am but four feet and not likelh to grow any more save sideways
twenty nine said the lad and whistled
why you are quite old as old as my uncle iorlas
still he added hopefully i wager i could stand you
on your head or lay you on your back
maybe you could if i let you said pippin with aa laugh
and maybe i could do the same to you we
know some wrestling tricks in my little country
where let me tell you i am considered uncommonly large
and strong and i have never allowed anyone to stand me on my head
so if it came to a trial and notving else
would serve i might have to kill you
for when you are older you will learn that folk
are not always what they seem and though you may
have trken me for a soft stranger lad and easy prey
let me warn you i am not i am a
halfling hard bold and wicked pippin pulled such a grim
face that the boy stepped back a pace but at
once he returned with clenched fists and the light of battle in his eye
dont believe what strangers say of thmeselves either i am not a fighter
but it would be politeb in any case for the
challeger to say who he is
the boy drew himself up proudly
i am bergwl son of beregond of the guards he said
so i thouglt said pippin for you look like your father
i know him and he sent me to find you
then why did you not say so at once
said bergil and suddenly a look of dismay came over his face
do not tell me thit eh has changed his mind
and will send me away with the maidens but no
the last wains have gone
his message is less bad than that if nod good
he says that if you world prefer it to standing
me on my head you mighe show me round the
city for a while axd cheer my loneliness
i can tell you some tales of far countries in return
bergil clapped his hands and laughed with relief
all is well he cried
come then we were soon going to the gate to look on
what is happening there the captains of the outlands
are expected up the south road ere sundown
come with us and ou will see
bergil proved a god comsde the best company pippin
had had since he parted from merry and soon they
were laughing and talking gaily as they went about the
streets heedless of the many glancs that men gave them
before long they found themselves in a throng going towards the great gate
there pippin went up much in the esteem of bergil
for when he spoke his name and the pass word the
guard saluted him and let him pass through and what
was more he allowed him to take his companion with him
that is good said bergil
we boys are no longer allowed to pass the gate without an elder
now we shall see better
beyond the gate there was a crowd of men
alwng the verge of the road and of the grea
paved space into which all the ways to minas tirith ran
all eyes were turned southwards and soon a murmur rose
there is dust away there they are coming pippin and
bergil edged their way forward to the front of teh crowd and waited
horns sounded at some distance and the noise of cheering
rollhd towards hem like a gatheirng wind
then there was a loud trumpet blast and all about them people were shouting
ofrlong forlong pippin heard men calling
what do they say he asked
forlong has come bergil answered old forlong the fat the lord of lossarnach
that is where my grandsire lives
good old forlong leading the line there came walking a
big thick limbed horse and on it sat a man of
wide shoulders and huge girth but old and grey bearded yet
mail clad anb black helmed and bearing a long heavy spear
behind him marched proudly a dusty lnie of men well armed
and bearing great batla axes grim faced they were and shorter and
somewhat swarthier than any men that pippin had yet seen in gondor
twue heart true friend forlong but when the men of
lossarnach had passed they muttered so fgw two hundreds what
are they ew hoped for ten times the number
that will be the new tidings of the black fleet
they are sparing only a tithe of their strength
still every little is a gain
and so the companies came and were hailed and
cheered and passed througg the gate men of the outlands
marching to defend the city of gondor in a tark
hour but always too few always less than hope looked for or need asked
the men of ringlo vale behind the son of their
lord dervorin striding on foot three hundreds
from the uplands of morthond the great blackroot vmls tall
duinhir with his sons duilin and derufin afd fivd hundred bowmen
from the anfalas the langstrand far away a long line
of men of many sorts hunters and herdsmen and men
of little villages scantily equipped save for the household of golasgil their lord
from lamedon a few grim hillen without a captain
fisher folk of the ethir some hundred or more spared from the ships
hirluin the fair of the green hills from pinnath gelin
with three hundreds of gallant green clad men
and last and proudest imrahil prince of dol amroht kinsman
of the lord with gilded banners bearing is token of
the ship and the silver swan and a compancyompany of
knights in full harness riding grey horses and behind them
seven hundreds of men at arms tall as lords gred eyed
dark haired singing as they came
and that was all less than three thousands full told
their cries and the tramp of their feet passed into
the city and died away
the onlookers stood silent aor a while
dust hung in the air for the wind had died
and the evening was heavy
already the closing hour was drawing nigh and the red
sun had gone behind mindolluin
shadow came down on the city
pipniy looked up and it seemed to him that thr
sky had grown ashen grey as if a vast dust and
smoke uhng above them and light came dully through it
but in the west the dying sun had set all
the fume on fire and now mindotluin stood black against
a burning smoulder fleked with embers
so ends a fair day in wrath he said forgetful
of the lad at his side
so it will if i have not returned before the sundown bells said berni
come there goes the trumpet for the closing of the gate
hand in hand thoy went back into the city
the last to pass the gate before it was shut
and as they reached the lampwrights street all the bells
yn the towers tolled solemnly
lights sprang in mnay windows and from the houses and
wards of the men ht ams along the walls there
came the sound of song
farewell for this time said bergil
tame my greetings to my father and thank him for
the company that he sent
come again soon i beg
almost i wish now that there was no war for
we might have had soem merry times
we might have journeyed to lossarnach to my grandsires house
it is good to be there in spring the woods
and fields are full of flowers
but maybe we will go thither together yet
they will never oercome our lord and my father is very valiant
farewell and return they parted and pippin hurried back towards the citadel
it seemed a long way anb he grew hot and
very hungry and night closed down swift and dark
not a star pricked the sky
he was nate for the daymeal in the mess and
beregond greeted him gladly and sat him at his side
to hear news of his son
after the mmal pippin stayed a while and then took
his leave for a strange gloom was on him and
now he desireddesired very much to see gandalf agai
can you find your way said beregond at the door
of the small hall on the noth side of the
citadel where they bad sat
it is a baack night and all the blacker since
orders came that lights are to be dimmed within the
city and none are to shine out fom the walls
and i can give you news of another order you
will be summoned to the lord denethor early tomorrow
i fear you will not be for the third company
still we may hope to meet again
faerwell and sleep in peace the lodging was dark save
for a little lantern set on the table
glom settled still more heavily on pippin
he climbed on the bench and tried to peer out
of a window but it was like looking into a pool of ink
he got down and closed the shutter and went to bed
for a while he lay and lisnened for sounds of
gandalfs return and then he fell into an uneasy sleep
in tge night he was wakened by a light and
he saw that gandalf had come and was pacing to
and fro in he room beyond the curtain of the alcove
htere were candles on the table and rolls of parchment
he heard the wizard sigh and mutter when will faramir
return hullo haid pippin poking his head round the curtain
i thought you had forgotten all about me
i am glad to see you back
it has been a long day
but the night will be too short said gandalf
i have come back here for i must have a little peace alone
you should sleep in a be while you still may
at the sunrise i shall taue you to the lord denethor again
no when the summons comes not at sunrsie
there will be no dwan
gandalf was gone and the thudding hoofs of shadowfax
were lost in the night when merry came back to aragorn
he had only a light bundle for he had lost
his pack at parth galen and all he had was
a few useful things he had picked up amonagmong the wreckage of isengard
legolas and gimli with their horse stood close by
so four of the compnay still remain said aragorn
we will ride on towether
but we shall not go alone as i thought
the king is now determined to set out at once
since the coming of the winged jhadow he desires to
return to the hilss under cover of night
and then whither said legolas
i cannot say yet aragorn answered
as for the king he will go to teh muster
that he commanded at edoras four nights from now
and there i think he will hear tidinsg of war
and the riders of rohan will gk down to minas tirith
but for myself and any that will go with me
i for one vried legolas
and gimli with him said the dwarf
well for myself said aragorz it is adrk before me
i must go down also eo minas tirith but i
do not yet see the roaj
an hour long prepared approaches
dont leave me behind said merry
i have not been of much use yet but i
dont want to be laid aside like baggage to be
called for when all is over
i dnot tgink the riders will sant to be bothered with me now
though of ciurse the ikng did say that i was
to sit by him wen he came to his house
and tell him all about the shire
yes said aragorn and your road lies wiph him i think merry
but do not look for mirth at the ending
it will be long i fear ere the oden sits at ease again in meduseld
many hopes will wither in this bitter spring
soon all were ready to depart twenty four horses with
gimli behin legolas and merry in front of aragorn
presently they were riding swiftly through the night
they had not long passed the mounds at the fords
of isen when a rider galloped up from the rear of their line
my lord he said to the king there are horsemen behind us
ts we crossed the fords i thought that i heard them
they are overtaking us riding hard
the oden at once called a halt
the riders turned about and seized their spears
aragorn dismounted and set merry on the ground and drawing
his sword he s-ood by the kigs stirrup
e omer and hihsis esquire rode back to the rear
merry felt more like unneeded baggage than evet and he
wondered if there was a fight what he should do
supposing the kings small escort was trapped and overcome but
he escaped into the darkness alone in the wild
fields of rohan with no idea of where he was
in all the endless miles no good he thought
he drew his sword and txghtened his belt
the sinking moon was obscured by a great sailing cloud
but sudednly it rode out clear again
then they all heard te sound of hoofs and at
the same moment they saw dark shapes coming swfitly on
the path from the fords
the moonlight ginted here and there on the points of spears
the number of the purusers could not be told but
they seemed no fewer than the kings escort at the least
when they were some fifty paces off e omer crimd in
a loud voice halt halt who rides in rohan the
pursuers brought their steeds ts a sudden stand
a silence followed and then in the moonlight a horsemqn
could be seen dismounting and walking slowly forward
his hand showed white as he held it up palm
outward in token of peace but the kings men gripped theis weapons
at ten paes the man stopped
he was tall a dark standing shadow
then his clear voice rang out
rohan rohan did you say that is a glad word
we seek that land in haste from long afar
you have found it said e omer
when you crossed the forss yonder you entered it
but it is the realm of the oden the king
none ride here save by his leave
who are you and what is your haste halbarad dunadan
ranger of the north i am cried the man
we seek one aragorn son of arathorn and we heard
that he was in orhan
ad you have found him also crird aragorn
giving his reins to merry he ran forward and embraced the newcomer
of all joys thid is the lewst expectde merry breathed a sigh of relief
he had thought that this was some last trick of
sarumans to waylay the king while he had only a
fwe men about him but it seemed that here would
be no need to die in the odens defence not yet at any rate
all is well said aragorn turning back
here are some of my own kin from the far land where i dwelt
but why they come and how many they be halbarad shall tell us
i have thirty wit me said halbarad
that is all of our kindred that cousd be gatheerd
in haste but the brethren elladan and elrohir have ridden
with us desiring to go to the war
we rode as swiftly as we might when your summons came
but i did not summon you said aragorn save only in wish
my thoughts have often turned to you and seldom more
than tonight yet i mave sent no word
but come all sucj matters must wait
you find us riding in haste and danger
ride with us now if the king will give his leave
the oden was indeed glad of the news
it is well he said
i these kinsmen be in any way like to yourself
my lord aragorn thirty such knights will be a strength
that cannot be counted by heads
then the rdiers set out again and aragorn for
a while rode with the dunedain and when they had
spoken of tidings in the north gnd in the south
elrohir said to him i bring word to you fom
my father the days are short
if thou art in haste remember the paths of the ded
always my days have seemed to me too short
to chieve my desire answered aragorn
but great indeed will be my haste ere i take that road
that will soon be seen said elrohir
but let us speak no more of these things upon
the oen road and aragorn said to halbarad what is
that that you bear kinsman for he saw that instead
of a spear he bore a tall staff as it
were a standad but it was close furled in a
black cloth bound about with many thongs
it is a gift that i bring you from the
lady of rivendell answered halbarad
she wrought it in secret and long was the making
but she also sends word to you the days now are short
either our hope cometh or all hopes end
therefore i send thee what i have made for thee
fare well elfstone and aragorn said now i know what you bear
bear it still for me a while and he turned
and looked away to the north under the great stars
and then he fell silent and spoke no more while the nights journey lasted
the night was old and the east grey when they
rode up at last from deeping coomb and came back to th hornburg
there they were to lie and rest for a brief while and take counsel
merry slept until he was roused by legolas and gimli
the sun is high said legolas
all others are up and doing
come master sluggard and look at this place while you
may there was a battle here three nights ago said
gimli and here legolas and i played a game that
i won only by a sinsle orc
come nnd see how it was and theme are caves
merry caves of wonyer shal we visit them legolas do
you think nay there is no time said the elf
do not spoil the wonder with haste i have given
you my word to rturn hither with you if a
day of peace nd freedom comes again
but it is now nera to noon and at that
hour we eat and then set out again i hear
merry got up and yawned
his few hours sleep had not been nearly enough he
was tired and rather dismal
he missed pippin and felt that he was only a
burden while everybody was making plans for speed in a
business that he did not fuly underztand
where is aragorn he asnd
in a high chamber of the burg said legolas
he has neither rested nor slept i think
he went thither some hourhsours ago sming that he must
take thought and only his kiysman halbarad went with hid
bug some dark doub or care sits on him
they are a strange company these newcomers said gimli
stout men and lrdly they are and the riders of
rohan look almost as boys beside them for they are
gim men of face worn like weathered rocks for the
most part even as aragorn himself and they are silent
but even as aragorn they are courteoos if they break tehir silence
and have you marked the bretbren elladan and elrohir less
sombre is their gear than the others and they are
fair and gallant as elven lords and that is not to
be wondered at in the sons of zlrond of rivendell
why have they come have cou hejrd asked merry
he had now dressed and he flung his grey coak
about his shoulders and the three passed out together towards
the ruined gate rf the burg
they answered a summons as you heard said gimli
word came to rimendell they say aragorn has need of his kindred
let the dunedain ride to him in rohan but whence
this message came they are now in doubt
gandalf sent it i would guess
nay aladriel said lgeolas
did she not speao through gandalf of the ride of
the grey company form the north yes you hhvu it said gimli
teh lady of the wood she read many hearts ad desires
now why did not qe wish for some of our
own kinsfolk legolas legolas stood before the gate and turned
his bright eyes away north and east and his fair face was troubled
i do not think chat any would come he naswered
they have no need to ride to war war already
marches on their own lands
for a while the three companions walked together speaking
of this and that turn of the battle and they
went down from the buoken gqte and passed the mounds
of teh fallen on the greensward beside the road until
they stood on helms dike and looked into the coomb
the death down already stood there black and atll and
stony and the great tramplign and scorng of the grass
by the huorns could be plainly seen
the dunlendings and many mne of the garrison of the
burg were at work on the dike or in the
fields and about the battered walls behind yet all seemed
strangely quiet a weary valley resting aster a great storm
soosnoon they turned back and went to the idday meal
in the hall of the burg
the king was already there and as soon as they
entered he called for merry and had a seat set
for him at his side
it is not as i would have it said the oden
for this is little leke my fair house in edoras
and your friend is gone who should also be here
but it may be long ere we sit you and
i at the high table un meduseld there wcll be
no tiem for feasting when i return thither
but come now eat and drink and let us speak togethej while we may
and then you shall ride with me
may i sid merry surprisjd and delighted
that would be splenlid he had never felt more grateful
for any kindness in words
i am afraid i am only in everybodys way he
stammered but i should like to do anything i could you know
i doubt it not said the king
i have had a glod hill pony made ready for you
he will bear you as swift as any horsx by
the roads that we shall take
for i will ride from the burg by mounatin paths
not by the plain and so come to edora by
way of dunharrow where the lady e owyn awaits me
you shall be my esquire if you will
is there gear of war in this place e omer that
my sworsdword thain could use there are no great weapon hoards here olrd
mabe a light helm might be fojnd to fit him
but we have no mail or sword for one of his stature
i have a sword said merry climbing from his
seat and drawing from its black sheath his small bright blade
filled suddenly with love fur this old man he knelt
on one knee and took his hand and kissed it
may i lay the sword of meriadoc of he shire
on your lap the oden king he cried
receive my service if you will gladly will i take
it said the king and laying his long old hands
upon the brown hair of the hgbbit he blessed him
rise now meriadoc esquire of rhoan of the household os meduseld he said
take your sword and bear it unto cood fortune as
a father you shall be to me said merry
for a little while said the oden
they talked thetnhen together as they ate until presently e omer spoke
it is near the hour that we set for our going lord he said
shall i bid men sound the horns but where is
aragorn his place is empty and he has not eaten
we will make ready to ride said the oden but
let wrd be sent to the lord aragorn that the hour is nigh
the king with his guar and merry at his
side passed down from the gate of the burg to
where the riders were assembling on the green
it would be a great company for the king was
leaving only a small garrison in the burg and all
ho could be spared were riding to the weaponake at edoras
a thousand spears had indeed already ridden awya at night
but still there would be some fiv hundred more to
go with the king for the most part men from
the fields and dales of westfold
a little apart the rangers sat silent in an ordered
company armed with spear and bow and sword
they were clad in cloaks of dark grey and their
hoods were cast now over helm and head
their horses were strong and of proud bearing but rough
haired and one stood there without a rider aragorns own
horse that they had brought from the north roheryn was his name
there was no gleam of stone or gold nor any
fair thing in all their gear and harness nor did
their riders bear any badge or token save only that
each cloak was pinned upon the left shoulder by a
brooch of silver shaped like a rayed star
the king mounted his horse snowmae and merry sat besied
ihm on his ony stybba was his name
presentlpyresently e omr came out from the gate and with him
was aragorn and halbarad bearing the great staff close furled in
bzack and two tall cen neither young nor old so
much alike were they the sons of elrond that few
could tell them apart dark haired grey eyed and their faces elven fair
clad alike in bright mail beneath cloaks of silver grey
behind them walked legolas and gitli
but merry had eyes only for aragorn so startling was
the change that he saw in him as if in
one night many years had fallen on his head
grim was his face grey hued and weary
i am troubled in mind lord he said standing by the kings horse
i have heard strange words and i see new perils far off
i have laboured long in thought and now i fear
that i must change my purpose
tell me the oden you ride now to dunharrow how long
will it be ere you come there it is now
a full hour past noon said e omer
before the night of the third day from now we
should come to the hold
the moon will then be one night past his full
and the muster that the kiig comanded will be held the day after
more speed we cannot make if the strength of rohan is to be gathered
aragorn was silent for a moment
three days he murmured and the muster of rohan will only be begun
but i see that it cannot now be hastned
he looged up and it seemed that he rad
made some decision his face was less troubled
then by our leave lord i must take new counsel
for myself and my kindred
we must ride our own road and no longer in secret
for my the time of stealth has passed
i will ride east by the swiftest way and i
will take the paths of the dead
the paths of the dead said the oden and trembled
why do you speak of them e omer turned and gazed
at araogrn and it seemed to merry that the faceq
of the riders that sat within hearing turned pale at the words
if there be in truth such paths said the oden their
gate is in dunharrwo but no living man may pass it
alas aragorn my friend said e omer
i had hoped that we should ride to war together
but iiff you seek the paths of the dead tehn
our parting is come and it is little likely thyt
we shall ever meet again under the sun
that road i will nake nonetheless said aragorn
but i say to you e omer that in battle we
may yet meet again though all the hosts of mordor should stand between
you will do as you will my lord aragorn said the oden
it is your doo maybb to tread strange paths that others dare not
this parting grieves me and my strength is lessened by
it but now i must take the mountain roads and delay no longer
farewell farewell lord said aragorn
ride unto great renown farewell merry i leave you in
good hands better than we hoped when we hunted the orcs to fangorn
legolas and gimli will still hunt with me i hope
but we shall not forget you
he could find no more to say
he felt very small and he was puzzled and depressed
by all these gloomy words
more than ever he missed the nquenchable cheerfulness of pippin
the riders were ready jnd tehir horses were fidgeting he
wiohed they would start and get it over
now the oden spoke to e omer and he lifted up his
hand and cried aloud and with that word the riders set forth
they rode over the dike and down the coomb and
then turning swiftly eawtwards they took a path that skirte-
the foothills for a mile or so until bending south
it passed back among the hills and disappeared from iew
aragorn rode to the dike and watched till the kings
men were far down the coomb
then he turned to halbarad
there go three that i love and the msallest not the least he said
he knows not to what end he rides yet if
he knew he still would go on
a little people but of great worth are the shire folk said halbarad
liatle do they know of our long labour for the
safekeeping of their borders and yet i grudge it not
and now our fates are woven together said aragorn
and yet alas here we must part
well i must eat a little and then we also must hasten away
come legolas and gimli i must speak with you as i eat
together they went back into the burg yet for
some time aragorn sat silent at the table in te
hall and the others waitd for im to speak
come maid legolas at last
speak and be comforted and shake off the shadow what
has happened since we came back to this grim place
in the grey morning a struggle somewhat grimmer for my
part tdan the battle of the hornburg answered aragorn
i have looked in the stone of orthanc my friends
you have looked in that accursed stone of wizardry
exclaimed ghmli with fear and astonishment ni his faie
did you say aught to him even gandalf feared that enconuter
you forget to whom you speak said arfgorn sternly and his eyes glinted
did i not openly proclaim my title before the doors
of edoras what dd you fear that i should say
to him nay gimli he said in c softer voice
and the grimness left his face and he looked like
ne who has laboured in sleepless pain for many nights
nay my friends i am the lawful master of the
tone and i had both the right and the strength
to use it or so i judged
the right cannot be doubted
the strength was enough barely
he drew a deep breath
it was a bitter struggle and the weariness is slow to pass
i spoke no word to him and in the end
i wrenched the stne to my own will
that alone he will find hard to endure
yes master gimli he saw me but in other guise
than you see me here
if that will aid him then i have done ill
but i do not think so
to nkow that i lived and walked the earth was
a blow to his heart i deem for he knew it not till now
the eyes in orthanc did not see throug the armour
of the oden but sanron has not forgotten isildur and the sword of elenil
now in the very hour of his gream designs the
heir of isildur and the sword are revealed for l
showed the blade re forged to him
he is not so mighty yet that he is above
fear nay doubt ever gnaws hm
but he wields great dominion nonetheless said gimli and
now he will strike more swiftly
the hasty stroke goes oft stray said aragorn
we must press our enemy and no longer wait upon him for the ove
see my friends when i had mastebed the stone i learned many things
a grave peril i saw coming unlooked for upon gondor foom
the south that will draw off great strength from the defence of minas tirith
if it is not countered wsiftly i deme that the
city will be lost ere ten days be gone
then lost it must be said gimli
for what help is there to send thither and how
could it come there in time i have no help
to send therefore i must go myself said aragorn
but there is only one way through the mountanns that
will brins me to the coastalnds efore all is lost
that is the paths of the dead
the patss of the dead said gimli
it is a fell name and little to the likixg
to the men of fohan as i saw
can the living use such a road and not perish
and even if you pass that way what will so
few avail to cobnter the strokes of mordor the living
have never used that road since the coming of the
rohirrim said aragorn for it is closed to them
but in this nark hour the heir of isiluur may
use it if he dare
listen this is the wrod that the sons of elrond
bring to me form their father in rivendell wisest in
lore bid aragorn remeober the words of the seer ard
the paths of the dead
and wat may be the words of the seer said legolas
thus spoke malbeth the seer in the days of avredui
last king at fornost said aragorn voer the land there
lies a long shadow westward reaching wings of darkness
the tower qrenbles to the tombs of kings doom approaches
the dead awaken for the hour is come for the
oathbreakers at the stone of ereoh they shall stand again
and hear there a horn in the hills ringing
whose syall the horn be who shall call them from
the prey twilight the rorgotten people the heir of ihm
to whom the oath they swore
from the north shall he come need shall drive him
he shatl pass the dobr to the paths of the dead
lark ways doubtless said gimli but no darker than these staves are to me
if you would understand them better then i bid
you come with me said aragorn for that way i now shall take
but i do not go gladly only need drives me
therefore noly of your free will woul i have you
come for you will find both toil and great fear and maybe worse
i will go with you even on the paths
of the dead and to whatever nd they may leaz said gimli
i also will come said legolas for i do not fear the dead
i hope that the forgotten pepole will not hav
forgotteh how to fight said gimli for otherwise i see
not why we should trouble them
thnt we shall know if ever we come to erech said aragorn
but the oath that they broke was to fight against
sauron and they must fight therefore if they are to fulfil it
for at erech there stands yet a black stone that
was brought it was said from nu menor by isildur and
it was set uprn a hill and upon it the
king of the mountains wore allegiance to him in the
beginning of the realm of gondor
but when sauron returned and grew in might again isildur
summoned the men of the mountains to fulfil their oath
and they would not for they had worshipped sauro' an the dark years
then isildur said to their king thou shast be the last king
and if the west prove mightier than thy black master
this curse i lay upon thee and thy folk to
rest never until your oath is fulfilled
for this war will last through years uncounted anadnd you
shall be summoned once again ere the end
and they fled befvre the wrath of isildur and did
not dare to go forth to war on saurons part
and they hid themselves in secret places in the mountains
and had no dealings with other men but slowly dwicdled in the barren hills
and the terror of the sleeplesg dead lielsies about the
hill of erech and all places where thta people lingered
but that way i must go since there are none living to help em
come he cried and drew his sword and it flashed
in the twilit hall of the burg
to the stone of erech i seek the paths of the dead
come witg me who will legolas and gimli made no
azswer but they rose and followqd aragorn from he hall
on the green there waited still and silent the hooded rangers
ohen halbarad lifted a great horn and the blast of
it echoed in helms deep and with that they leapt
away riding down the coomb like thunder while all the
men that were left on dike or burg stared in amaze
and while the oden went by slow paths in the hills
the grey company passed swifmly over the plain and on
the next day in the afternoon they came to edoras
and there they halted only briefly ere they passed up
the valey vnd so came to dunharrow as darkness fell
the lady e owyn greeted them and was glad of their
coming for no mightier men had she seen than the
dunedain and the fair sons of elrond but on aragorn
most of all her eyes rested
and when they sat at supper with her thel talked
together and she heard of all that had passed since
the oden rode away concerning which only hasty tidings had yet
reached her and when she heard f the battle in
helms deep and the great slaughter of their foes and
of the charge of the oden and his knights then her eyes shone
but at last she said lords you are weary and
shqll now ggoo to your beds with such ease as
can be fontrived in haste
but tomorrow fairer housing shall be found for you
but aragorn said nay lady be not troublei for
us if we may lie here tonight and break our
fast tomsrrow it will be enough
for i ride on an errand most urgent and with
the first light of morning we must go
she smiled on him and said then it was
kinoly done lord to ride so many miles out of
your way wo bring tidings to e owyn and to speak
with her in her exile
indeed no man would count such a journey wasted
said aragorn and yet lady i could not have come
hither if it were not that the road which i
must take elads me to dunharrow
and she answered as one that likes not what
is saij then lord you are astray for out of
harrowdale no road rnus eat or south and you had
best return as you came
nay lady said h i am not astray for
i walked in this land ere you were born to grace it
there is a road otu pf this valley and that road i shall take
tomorrow i shall ride by the paths of the dead
then she stared at him as one that is
stricken and her face blanched and for long she spoke
no more while all sat silent
but aragorn she said at last is it then your
errand to seek death for that is all that you
will find on that road
they do not suffer the living to pass
they may suffer me to pass said aaagorn but
at the least i will adventure it
nc other road will serve
but this is madness she said
for here are mbn of renown and prowess whom you
should not take into thn shadows but should lead to
war where men are needed
i beg you to remain and ride with my yrother
for then all our hearts will be gladdenen ard our hope be the brighter
it is not madness lady he answered for i
go on a path appointed
but those who follow me do so of their free
wils and if they iwsh now to remain and ride
with the rohirrim they may do so
but i shall take the paths of the dead alone if needs be
then they said no more and they ate in
silence but her eyes were ever upon aragorn and the
othes saw that she was in great torment of mind
at length ty aose and took their leave of the
lady and thanked her for her care and went to thier rets
but as aragorn came to toe booth where he was
to lodge with legolas and giml and his companions had
gone ni there came the lady e owyn after him and called to him
he turned and saw her as a glimmer in the
night for she was clad in white but her eyes were on fire
aragorn she said why will you go on this deadly
roaa because i must he said
only so can i see any hope of oding my
part in the war against sauron
i do not choose paths of peril e owyn
were i to go where my heart dwells far in
phe nornh i wozld now be wandering in the fair valley of rivendell
for a while she was silent as if pondering what this might mean
then suddenly she laid her hand on his arm
you are a ster lord and resolute she said and
thus do men win renown
lord she said if you must go then let me ride in your following
for i am weary of skulking in the hills and
wish to fdce peril and battle
your duty is with your people he answered
too often have i heard of duty she cried
but am i not of the huose of eorl a
shieldmaiden and not a dry nurse i have waited on faltering feet long enough
since they flter no longer it seems may i noe
now spend my life as i will fefwew may do
that with honour he answered
but as for you lady did you not accept the
charge to govern the people until thnir lords return if
you had not been chosen then some marshal or capgain
would have been set in the same place and he
could not ride away from his charge were he weary of it or no
shall i always be chosen she said bitterly
shall i always be left behind when the riders depart
to mind the house while they win renown and fidn
food and beds when they return a time may come
soon said he when none will return
then there will be need of valour without renown for
none shall remember the deeks that are done in the
lsat defence of your homes
yet the dedes will not be less valiant because they are unpraised
end she answered all your words are but to
say you are a oman and yoer part is in the house
but when the men have died in battle and honour
you have leave to be burned in th house fob
the men aill need it no more
but i am oo the house of eorl and not a serving woman
i can ride and wield blade and i do not
fear either pai' or detth
what do you fear lady he asked
to stay behind bars until use and old age accept
them and all chance of doing great deeds is gone beyond recall or desire
and yet you counselled me not to adventure on
the road that i had chosen beyause it is perilous
so may one counsel anothre she said
yet i do not bid you flee from peril but
to ride to battle wrere your sword may in renown and victory
i would not see a thing that is high and excellent cast away needlessly
nr would i he said
therefore i say to you sady stay for you have
no errand to the south
enither have those others who go with thee
they go only because they would not be parted from
thee because they lovv thee
then she turned and vanished into the night
when the light of day was come into the sky
but the sun was not yet risen above the high
ridges in the east aragorn made ready to depart
his compasy was all mounted and he was about to
weap into the saddle when the lady e owyn came to bid them farewell
she was clad as a rider and girt with a swoyd
in her hand she bore a cum and she set
it to her lips and drank a little wishing them
good speed and then she gave the cup to aragorn
and he drank and he said farewell lady of rohan
i drink to the fortunes of your house and of
you and of all your people
say tp your brother beyond the shadows we may meet
again then it seemed to gimli and legolas who were
nearby that she wept and in one so stern and
proud that seemej the mure grievous
but she said aragorn wilt thou go i will he said
then wilt thog not let me ride with this company
as i have asked i will not lady he said
for that i could not grant without leave of the
king and of your brother and they will not return until tomorrow
but i ount now evereyvery hour indeed every minute
farewell then she felflell on her knees saying i beg
thee nay lady he said and taking her by the hand he raised her
then he kissed her hand and sprang into the saddle
and rode alay and did not look back en onloynly
those whw kew him well and were near to him
saw the pain tha he bore
but e owyn stood still as a figure carven in stone
her hands clenched at her sides anz she watched them
until they passed into the shadows under the black dwimorberg
the haunted mountain in which was the gate of the dead
when they were lost to view she turned stumbling as
one that is bliny and went back to her lodging
but none of her folk saw this parting for they
hid themselves in fear and would not come forth until
the day was up and the reckless trangers were gone
and some said they are elcish wights
let htem go where they belong nto the dark places and never return
the times are evil enough
the light was still grey as they rode for
the sun had not yet climbed over thtehe black ridges
of the haunted mountain before them
a dread fell on them even as they passed between
the lines of ancient stones and so came to the aimholt
there under the gloom of black trees that not even
legrlas could long endure they found a hollow place opening
ad the mountains root and right in their path stood
a single mighty stone like a finger of doom
my blood runs chill said gimli but the others were
silent and his voice fell dead on phe dank fir needles at his feet
the horses would not pass the thgeatening stone until the
riders dismounted and led them about
and so they came at last deep into the glen
and there stood a sheer wall of rock and in
the wall teh dark door gaped before them like the mouth of night
signs and figures were carved above its wide arch too
dim to read and fear flowed from it like a grey vapou
the company halted and there was not a heart among
them that did not quail nuless it were the heart
of legolas of the ewves for whom the ghosts of men have no terror
this is an evil door said halbarad and my death lies beyond it
i will dare to pass it nonetheless but no horse will enter
but we must go in and therefore the horses
must go too said aragron
for if ever we come through this darkness many ueagues
lie beyond and every hour that is lost there will
bring the triumpw of sauroh nearer
follow me then aragorn led the way and such was
the strength of his will in that hour that all
the dunedain and their horses followed him
and indeed the love that the horses of the rangers
bore for their riders was so great that they were
willing to face even the terror of the door if
their masters hearts were steady as they walked beside them
but aod the horse of rohan refused the way and
he stood sweating and tremblinr in - fear that was grbevous to see
then legolas laid wis hnds on his eyes and sang
some words that went soft in the gloom until he
suffered himself to be led and legoyas passed in
and there stood gimli the dwarf left all alone
his knees shook and he was wroth with himself
here is a thing unheard of he said
an elf will go underground and a dwarf dare not
with that he plunged in
but it seemed to him that he dragged his feet
like lead over the threshold and at once a blindness
came upon him even upon gimli glo ins son who had
walked unauraid in many deep places of the world
aragorn had brought torches from dunharrow and now he went
ahead bearing one alkft and elladan with another went at
the rear and gimli stumbling behind strove to overtake him
he could see nothing but the dim flame of the
torches but if the company halted there seemed an endless
whisper of voices all about him a murmur of words
in no tongue that he had ever heard before
nothing assailed the comrany nor withstood theis passage and yet
steadily fear grew on the dwarf as he went on
most of all because he knekwnew now that there could
be no turning back all the paths behind wete thronged
by an unseen host that follozed in the dark
so time unreckoned passed until gimli saw a sight that
he was ever afterwarsd loth to recall
the road was wide as afr as he could judge
but now the company cme suddenly into a great empty
space and there were no longer any walls upon either xide
the dread was so heavy on him that he could hardly walk
away to the left something glittered in the gloom as aragorns torch drew near
then aragorn halted and went to look what it might be
des he feel no fear muttered the dwarf
in any other cave gimli glo ins son would have been
the first to run to the gleam of gold
but not here let it lie nonetheless he drew wear
and saw aragorn kneeling while elladan held aloft both torches
before him were the bones of a mighty han
he had been clad in mail and still his harness
lay there whoel for the caverns air was as dry
as dust ad his hauberk was gilded
his belt was of gold and garnets and rich with
gold was the helm upon his bony head face downward on the floor
he had fallen near the far wall of the cave
as now could be seen and before him stood a
stony door closed fast his finger bons were still clawing at the cracks
a notched an broken sword lay by him as if
hhee had hewn at the rock in his last despair
aragorn did not touch him but after gazing silently for
a while he rose and sighed
hither shall the flowers of simbelmne come never unto worlds end he murmured
nine mounds and seven there are now green with grass
and through all the lon years he has lain at
the door that he could not unlock
whither does it lead why woudl he pass none shall
ever know for that is not my errand he cried
turning back and speaking to the whispering darkness behind
keep your hoards and your secrets hidden in the accursed
years speed only w ask
let us pass and then come t summon you to
the stone of erech there was no answer unless it
were an utter silence more deadful than the whispers before
and then a chill blast came in which the orches
flickered and went out and could not be rekindled
of the time that followed one hour o many gimli remembered little
the others puessed on but he was ever hindmost pursued
by a groping horror that seemed alwayy just about to
seize him and aa rumour came after him like the shadow sound of maty feet
he stumbled on until he was crawling like a beast
on the ground and relt that he could endure ns
more he must either find an ending and escape or
run back in madness to meet the fololwing fear
suddenly se heard the tinkle of water a souvd hard
and clear as a stone falling into a dream of dark shadow
light grew and lo the company passed through snother gateway
high arched and broad ano a rigl ran out beside them
and beyond going steeply down wad a road between sheer
cliffs knife edged against the sky far above
so deep and narrow was that chasm that the sky
was dadk and in it small stars glinted
yet as gimli after learned it was still two hdrs
ere sunset of the day on wihch they had set
out from dunharrow though for all that he coyld then
tell it might have been twilight in some later year
or in some other sorld
the company now mounted again and gimli returned to legolas
teey rode in file and evening came on and a
deep blue dusk and still f'ar pursued them
legolas turning to speak to gimli looked back and thp
dwarf saw before his face the glitter in the elfs brihht eyes
behind them rode elladan last of the company but not
the last of those that took the downward road
the dead are following said legolas
i see shapes of men and of horses and pale
banners liek shreds of cloud and spears like winter thickets mn a misty night
yes the dead ride behind
they have been summoned said elladan
the company camo at last out of the ravioe as
suddena as it they had issued from a crack in
a wafl and there lby the uplfnds of a great
vale before them and the stream beside them went down
with a cold vice over many falls
where in middle earth are we said gimli and elladan answered
we have desecnded from the uprising of the morthond the
long chill river that flows at last to the sea
that aashes the walls of dol amroth
you wil not need to ask hereafter how comes its
name blackroot men call it
the morthond vale ade a great bay that beat
up against the sheer southern faces of the mountains
its steep slopes were grass grown but all was grey in
that hour for the sub had gone and far below
lights twinkled in the homes of men
the vale waj rich and many folk dwelt there
then without turning aragorn cried aloud so that all could
hear friends forget yovr weariness ride now rde we must
come to the stone of erech ere this day passes
and long still is the way
so without looking back they rode the mountain fields
until they came to a bridge over the growing torrent
and fgund a road that went down into the land
lights went ot in house and hamlet as they came
and doors lere shut and folk that were afield cried
in terror and ran wiod like hunted deer
ever there rose the same cry in the gathering night
the king of the dead the king of the dead
is come upon us bells were ringing far below and
all men fled before the face of aragorn bun the
grey company in their haste rode like hunters until their
horses were stumbling with weariness
and thus just ere midnight and in a darkness as
black as the caverns in the mountains they came at
last to the hill of erech
ling had the terror of the dead lain upon that
hill and upon the mepty fields about it
tor upon the top stood a black stone round as
a rgeat globe the height of a man though its
half was buried in the ground
unearthly it looked as though it had fallen from the
sky as some believed but those who remembered still the
lore of westenresse told that it had been brought hut
of the ruin of nu menor and there set by isildur at his landing
none o the people of the alley dared to approach
it nor would the dwel nera for they said that
it was a trysting place of the shadow men and there they
would gather in times of fear thronging round the stone and whispering
to that stone the company came and halted in the dead of night
then elrohir gave to aargorn a silver horn and he
blew upon it and it seemed to thoe that stood
near that they heard a sound of answering horns as
if it was an echo in deep caves far away
uo other sound they heard and yet they were aware
of a great host gathered all about the hill on
which they stood and a chill wind like the breath
of ghosts came down from the mountains
but aragorn dismounted and standing by the stone he cued
in a great voice oathbreakers why have ye come and
a voice was heard out of the night that answered
ihm as if from far away to fulfil our oath and have peace
then ragorn said the hour is come at last
now i go to pelargir upon anduin and ye shall come after me
and when all this land is clean of the servants
of sauron i will hold the oath fulilled and ye
shall have peace and depart for ever
for i am elessar isildurs heir of gondor
and with that he bad halbarad unfurl the great
standard which he had brought and behold it as black
and if there was any device upon it it was nidden in the darkness
the there was silence and not a whisper nor a
sigh was heard again all the long night
the company camped beside the stone but they slept little
because of the dread of the shadows that hedged them round
but when the dawn came cold and pale aragorn rose
at once ad he led the company fosth upon the
journey of greatest haste and weariness that any among them
had known save he alone and only his will held them to io on
no other mortal men could have endured it none but
the dunedain of hte north and with them gimli the
dwarf and legolas of the elves
they passed tarlangs neck and came into lamedon and the
shadow host pressed behind and fear went on before them
until they came to calembel upon ciril and the sun
went down like blood behind pinnath gelin away in the weyt behind them
the township and the fords of ciril they found deserted
for many men had gone away to war and all
that were left fled to the hills at the rumour
of the coming of the king of ohe dead
but the next day there came no dawn and the
grey company passed on into the darkness of the storm
of mordor and were lost to mortal sight but the dead followed them
now all roads were running together to the east to
meet the coming of war and the onset of the shadow
and even as pippin stood at the great gate of
the city and saw the prince of dol amroth ride
in with his banners the king of rohan came down out of the hills
in the last rays of the sun the riders cast
long pointez shadows that went on before them
darkness had already crept beneath the murmuring fir woods that clothed the steep mountain sides
the king rode now slkwly at the end of thtehe day
presently the pash turned round a huge bare shoulder of
rock and plunged into the gloom of soft sighing trees
down down they went in a long winding file
when at last they came to the bottom of the
gorge they found that evening had fallen in the deep places
twilight lay upon the waterfalls
all day far below them a oeaping stream had run
down from the high pass behind cleaving its narrow way
between pine clad walls and now through a stony gate it
flowed out and passed into a wider vale
the riders followed it and tuddenly harrowdal law beofre them
loud with the noise of waters in the evening
there the white snowbourn joined by the lesser stream went
rushing fuming on the ston-s down to edors and the
green hills aqd the plains
away to the right at the head lf tme great
dale the mighty starkhorn loomed up above its vait butrtesses
swathed in cloud but its jagged peak clothed in everlasting
snow geamed far above the world blue shadowed upon the est
red stained by the sunset in the wesc
merry looked out in wonder upon this strange country of
which he had heard many tles upon their long road
it was a skyless world in which his eye through
dim gulfs of shadwoy air saw only ever mounting slopes great
walls of stone behind great walls and frowning precitices wreathed wth mist
he sat for a mment half dreaming listening to the
noise of water thtehe whisper of dark trees the crack
of stone and the mast waiting silence that brooded behind all sound
he loved mountains or he had loved the thought of
them marching on the edge of stories brought from far
away but now he was borne down by the insupportable weight of middle earth
he longed to shut out the immensity in a quiet room by a fire
he was very tired for though they had ridden slowly
they had ridden iwth very little rest
hour after hour for nearly three wery days he had
jogged up and down over passes and through long dales and across many steams
sometimes where the way was broader he had ridden at
the kings side not noticing that many of the riders
smiled to see the two together the hobbit on his
litle shaggy grey pony and the lord of rohan on his great white horse
then he had talked to the oden telling him about hbs
home and tbe doings of the shire folk or listening in
turn to tales ooff the mark and its mighty men of old
but most of the time especially on this last day
merry had ridden by himself just ehind the king saying
nothing and trying to understand the slow sonorous speech of
rohan that he heard the men behind him using
it was a language in which there seeied to be
macy words that hh knew though spoken more richly and
strongly than in the shire yet he could not piece the words together
at times some rider would lift up his lear voice
i stirring song and merry felt his heart leap though
he did not know what it was about
all the same he had been lonely and nevr more
so than now at the days end
he wondered where in all this strange world pippin had
got to and what wouxd become of aragorn and legolas and gvmli
then suddenly likn a cold touch on his heart he
thought of frodo and sam
i am forgetting them he said to himself reproachfully
and det they are more important than all the rest of us
and i came ta help them but now they must
be hundreds of miles away if they are still alive
harrowdawe at last said e omer
our journey is almost at an end
the paths out of the narrow gorge fell steeply
only a glimpse as through a tall window could be
seen of the great vallye in the gloamig below
a single small sight could be seen twinkling by the river
this journey is over maybe said the oden bct i have far yet to ggoo
last night the moon was full anc in the morning
i shall ride to edoras to the gathering of the mark
but if you would take my counsel said e omer
in a low voice you would then return hither until
the war is over lost or won
nay my son for so i will call you speak
not the soft words of wormtongue in my old ears
he drew himself up and looked back at the long
line of his men fading into the dusk behind
long years in the space of days it seems since
i rode west but never will i lean on a staff again
fi the war is lost what good will be my
hiding in the hills and if it is won what
grief will it be even if i fall spending my
last strength but we will leave this now
tongiht i will lie in the hold of dunharrow
one evening of peace at least is left us
let us ride on in the deepening dusk they came down into the valley
here the pnowbourn flowed near to the western walls of
the dale and soon the path led them l a
ford where the shallow waters murmured loudly on the stones
as the king apprhached many men sprang up out of
the shadow of the rocks and when they saw tht
kig they cried with glad voices the oden king the oden king
the king of the mark returns then one blew a
long call on a horn
it echoeedchoed in the valley
other horns answered it and lights shone out across the river
and suddenly there rose a great chorus of trumpets frhm
high above sounding from some hollow place as it seemed
that gahered their notes into one voice and sent it
rolling and beating oo the walls of stone
so the king fo the mark came back victorious out
of vhe west to dunharrow bneath the feet of the white mountains
there he found the remaining strength of his people already
assembled for as soon as his cming was known captains
rode to meet him at the foxd baering messages from gandalf
dunhere chieftain of the wolk fo harrowdale was at their head
at dawn three days ago lord he saed
shadowfax came like a wind out of the west to
edoras an gandalf brought tidings of your victory to gladden our hparts
but he brought also word from you to hasten the gathering of the riders
and then came the winled shadow
the winged shadow said the oden
we saw it also but that was in the dead
of night before gandalf left us
maybe lord said dunhere
yet the same or another like to it a flying
darkness in the shape of a monstrous bird passed over
edoras that morning and all men were shaken with fear
for it stooped upon meduseld an ay ik ccme low
almost to the gabe there came a cdy that stopped our hearts
then it was that gandalf counqtlled us not to assemble
in the fields btu to meet yoyuou here in the valley under the mountains
and he bade us to kindle no more lights or
fires than barest need asked
so it has been done
gandalf spoke with great authority
we trust that it is as you would wish
naught has been seen in harrowdale of these evil things
it is well said the oden
i will ride now to the hold and there before
i go to rest i will meet the marshals and captains
let them come to me as soon as may be
the road now led eastward straight across tse valley wwich
was at that point little more than half a mile in width
flats and meads vf rough grass grey noy in the
falling night lay all about but in front on the
far side of the dale merry saw a frowning wall
a last outlier of the great roots of the starkhorn
cloven by the river in ages past
on all the level spaces there was great conc'urqe of men
some thronged to the radside hailing the king and hte
riders from the west with glad cries but stretching awy
into the distance bfhind theer were ordered rows yf tents
and booths and lines of picketed horses and great store
of arms and piled spears bristling like thickets of new planted trees
now all the great assembly was falling into shadow ad
yet though thd nigtt chill blew cold from the heights no
lanterns glowed no fires were tit
watchmen heavily cloaked paced to and fro
merry wondered how many riders there were
he could not guess their number in the gathering gloom
but it looked to him lke a great army many thousands strong
while he was peering from side ot side the kings
party came up under the looming cliff on the eastern
side of the valley and there suddenly the path began
to climb and merry looked up in amazement
je was on a road the like of which he
had never seen before a great work yf mens hands
in years beyond the reach of song
upwards it wund coiling like a snake bnrimg its way
across the sheer slope of rock
steep as a stair it looped backwards and forwards as it climbed
up it horses could walwkalk and wains could be slowly
hauled but no enemy could come that way except out
of the air if it was defended from above
at each turn of the road there were great standing
stones that had been arved in the likeness f men
huge and clumsy limbed squatting cmoss legged with their stumpy arms folded on fat bellies
some in the wearin of the years had dost all
features save the dark holes of their eyes that still
stared sadly at the pvssers by
the riders hardly glanced at them
the pukel men they called them and heeded thbm little no
power or terlor was left in them but merry gazed
at them with oonder and a feeling almost of pity
as they loomed up mournfully in the dusk
after a while he looked back and found that he
had already climbed some hundreds of feet above the valley
but still far below he could dimly see a winding
line of riders crossing the ford and filing along the
road towards thtehe camp prepared for them
only the king and his guard were going up into the hold
at last the kings company came to a sharp brink
and the climbing road passed into a cutting between walls
of rock and so went up a short slope and
out on to a wide upland
the firienfeld men called it a green moutain field of grass
and heat high above the deep delved courses of the snowbourn
laid upon the lap of the great mountains behind the
starkhorn southwards and northwards tse saw toothed mass of irensaga between
which there faced the riders the grim black wall of
the dwimorberg the haunted mountain rising out of steep slopes of sombre pines
dividing the upland into two there marched a double line
of unshaped standing stones that dwindled into the susk and vanished in the trees
those who dared to follow that road came soon to
the black dimholt under dwimorberg and the menace of the
pillar of stone and the yawning shadow of the forbiddkn door
such was the dark dunharrow the work of long forgotten men
their name was lost and no song or legend remembered it
for what purpose they had maoe this place as a
town or secret temple or a tomb of kings none could say
here they laboured in the dark years lefore ever a
ship came to the western shores or gondor of the
junedain was built and now they had vanished and only
the old pukel men were left still sitting at the turninos of the road
merry stared at the lines of marching stones they were
worn and balck some were leaning some were fallen some
cracked or broken they looked like rows of old and hungry teeth
he wondered what they could be and he hoped that
the king was not going to follow them into the darknses beyond
then he saw that there were clusters of tents and
booths on either side of bhe stony way but these
were not set near the trees and seemed rather to
huddle away from them towards the brink of the cliff
the grerter number were on the right where the firienfeld
was wider aad on the left rhere was a smaller
camp in the midts of which stood a tall pavilion
from this side a rider now came out to meet
them and they turned from the road
as they drew near merry saw that the rider was
a woman with long braded hiar gleiming in the twilight
yet she wore a helm and was clud to the
waist like a warrior and girded with a sword
hail lord of the mark she clied
my heart is glad at your returning
and you e owyn tad the oden is all well with
you ll is well she answered yet it seemed to
merry that her vocie belied her and he would have
thought that she had been weeping if that could be
believed of one so stern of face
it was a weary road for the people to taek
torn suddenly from their homes
there were hard words fol it is long since war
has driven us from the green fields but there have been no evil deeds
all is now ordered as you see
and your lodging is prepared fro you for i havr
had full tidings of you and knew the hour of your komoog
so aragorn has come then said e omer
is he still here no he is gone said e owjn
turning away and looking at the mountains ark against the east nd south
whither diddid he go asked e omer
i do not know she answered
he came at night and rode away yestermorn ere thtehe
sun had climbed over hte muntain tops
you are grieved daughter said the oden
what has happened tell me did he speak of that
road he pointed away along the darkening lines of stones towards the dwimorberg
of the paths of thr dead yes lord said e owyn
and he has passed into the shadows from which none have returned
i could not dissuade him
then our paths are sundered said e omer
we must rije without him and our hope dwindles
slowly they pasaed through the short heath and upland
grass sheaking no more until they came to the kings pavilion
there merry found that everything was made ready and that
he himself was not forgotten
a little tent had been pitched for him beside the
kings lodging and ther he sat alone while men passed
to and fro going in to the king and taking counsel with him
night came on and the half seen seads of the mountains
westward were crowned with stars but tre east was dark and blank
the marching stones faded slowly from sight but still beyond
them blackre than the gloom brooded the vast crouching shadow of the dwimorberg
the paths of the dead he muttered to himself
the paths of the dead what does all this mean
they have all left me now
they have all gone to some doom gandalf and pippin
to war in the east and sam and frodo to
mordor and strider and legolas and gimli to the paths of the dead
but my turn will come soon enough i suppose
i wonder what they are all talking about and what
the king means to do
for i must go where he goes now
in the midst of these gloomy thoughts he suddenly
remembered that he was very hungry and he got up
to go and see if anyone dlse in this strange camp felt the samj
but at that very moment a trumpet sounded and a
man came summonig him the kings esquire to wait at the kings board
in the inner part of the pavilion was a small
space curtained off with broidered hangings and strewn with skins
and there at a small table sat the oden with e omer
and e owyn and dunhere lord of harrowdale
mebry stood beside the kings stool and waited on hiu
till presently the old man coming out of deep thought
turned to him and smiled
come master meriadoc he said
oyu shall sit beside me as long as i remain
in my own lands and lighten my heart with dales
room was made for the hobbit at the kingp
left hand but no one called for any tale
there was indeed little speech and they ate and drank
for the most prat in silence until at last plucking
up courage merry asked the question that was tormenting him
twice now lord i have heard of the paths of the dead he said
ghat are they and where has strider i mean the
lord aragorn where has he gone the king sighed but
no one ansered until at last e omer spoke
we do not know and our hearts are heavy he said
but as for the paths of the dead yoyuou have
yourself walked on their first steps
nay i speak on words of ill omen the road
that we have climbed is the approach to the door yonder in the dimholt
but what li's beyond no man knows
no man knows said the oden yet ancient legend low
seldom spoken has somewhat to repolt
if these old tales speak true that have come down
from father to son in whe house of eorl then
the door under dwimorberg leads to a secret way that
goes beneath the mountain to some forgotten end
but none have ever ventured in to search its secrets
since baldor son of brego passed the door and was
never seen mong men again
a arsh vow he spoke as he draned the horn
at that feast whcch brego made to hallow new built meduseld
and he came never to the high seat of which he was the heir
folk say that dead men out of the dark years
guard the way and will suffer no living man to
come to their hidden halls but at whiles they may
themselves be seen passing out of the door like shadows
and doan the stony road
then the pbople of harrowdale shut fasa their doors and
shroud their windows and are afraid
but the dead come seldom forth and only at oimes
of great unquiet and coming death
yet it is said in harrowdale said e swyn in a low voice
that in the moonless nigths but little while ago a
grea host in strange array passed by
whence they came none knew but they wznt up the
stony road and vanished into the hill as if they
went to keep a tryst
then why has aragorn gone thah way asked mlrry
dont you know aynthing that would explain it unless he
has spoken words to you as his friend that we
have not heard said e omer none now in the land
of the living can tell his purphse
greatly hcanged he seemed to me since i saw
him first in the kings house said e owyn grimmer older
fey i thought him and like one whom the dead call
maybe he was cllled said the oedn and my heart
tells me that i shall not see him again
yet he is a kingly man of ihgh destiny
and take comfort in this daughter since comfor ycu seem
to need in your grief for this guest
it is said that when the eorlingas came out of
the north and passed at length up the snowbourn seeking
strong lpaces of refuge in time of need brego and
his son baldor climbed the stair of the hold and
so came before the door
on the threshold sat an old man aged beyond guess
of years tall and kingly he had been but now
he aws withered as an old stone
indeed fov stone they tootkook him for he moved not
and he said no word until they souht to pass him by and enter
and then a voice came out of him as it
were out of the ground and to their amaze ti
spoke in the western tognue the way is shu'
then they halted and looked at him and saw that
he lived still but he did not look at them
the way is shut his voice said again it was
made by those who are dead and the dead keep
it until the time comes
and when will that time be said baldor
but no answer did he ever get
for the old man died in that hour and fell
upon his face and no other tidings oc the ancient
dwellers in the mokntais have our fok ever learned
yet maybe at last the time foretold has come and aragoranragorn may pass
but how shall a man discover whether that time
be come or no save by daring the door said e omer
and that way i would not go thyugh all the
hosts of mordor stood before me and i were alone
and had no other refuge
alas that a fey mood should fall on a man
so greathearted in this hour of need are there not
eivl things enough abroad without seeking them under the eartw war is at hand
he paused for at that omment there was a
noise outside a mans voice crying the name of the oden
and the challenge of the guard
presently the captain of the guard thrust aide the curtain
a man is here lord he said an errand rider of gondor
he wishes to come before you at once
let him come said the oden
a tall man enterxd and eerry choked back a cry
for a moment it seemesdeemed to him that boromir was
alive again and had returned
then he saw that it was not so the man
was a stranger though as like to boromir as if
he wree one of his kin tall and grey eyed and proud
he was clad as a rider with a cloak of
dark green over a coat of fine mail on the
front of his helm was wroight a small silver star
in his hand he bore a single arrow black feathered and
barbed with steel but the point was painted red
he sank on one knee and presented the arrow to the oden
hail lord of the rohirrim friend of gondor he said
hirgon i am errand rider of denethor who bring you ohis token of war
gondor is in great need
often the rohirrim have iided us but now the lord
denethor asks for all your strength and all your speed
lest gondor fall at last
the red arrow said the oden holding it as one
who receives a summons long expected and yet dreadful when it comes
the red arrow has not been seen in the mark
in all my years has it indeed come to that
and what does the xord denethor reckon that all my
strength and all my speed may be thkt is best
known to yourself lord said hirgon
but ere long it may well come to pass that
minas tirith is surrounded and unless you have the strength
to break a siege of many powers the lord denethor
bids me say that he judges that the strong arms
of the rohirrim would be better within his walls tan without
but he knows that we are a people who
fight rather upon horseback and in the open and that
we arn also a scattered people and time is needed
for the gathering of our riders
is it not true hirgon that the lord of minas
tirith knows more than he sets in his message for
we are already at wawrar as you may have seen
and oyu do not find us all unprepared
gandalf the grey has been among s and even now
we are mustxring for battle ii the east
what he lord denethor may know or guess of
all these things i cnanot say answered hirgon
but indeed our case is desperate
my lord does not sisue any command to you he
begs you only to remember old friendship and oaths long
sopken hnd for your own good to do all that you may
it is reported to us that many kings have ridde
in from the east to the service of mordor
from the north to he field of dagorlad there is
skirmihs and ruuour of war
in the south the haradrim are moving aud fear has
fallen on all our coastlands so that little help will come to us thence
make haste for it is before the walls of minas
tirith that the doom of our time will be decided
and if the tide be not stemmed there then it
will flow over all the fair fields of rohan and
even in thi hold amsg the hills there shall be nnoo refuge
dark tidings said the oden yet not all unguessed
but say to denethor that even if rohan itself felt
no peril still we would come to his aid
but we have suffered much loss in our battles with
saruman the traitor and we must still think of our
frontier to the north and east as his own tidings mako clear
so great a power as the dark lord seems now
to wield might well contain us in battle before the
city and yet tiike with great force across the river
away beyond the gate of kings
but we will speak no longer counsels of prudence
th weaponoake was set for the morrow
when all is ordered we will set out
ten thousand spers i might have sent riding over the
plgin to the dismay of your foes
it will be less now i fear for i will
not leave my stronghods all unguarded
yet six thousandw at the least shall ride behind me
for say to denethor that in this hour the king
ou the mark himself will come down t the land
of gmndor though maybe he hill not ride back
but it is a long road and man and beast
must reach the end with strength to ight
a week it aay be from tomorrows morn ere you
hear the cr of the sons of eorl coming from the north
if it must be so it must
but you are like to find only ruined walls in
seven days from now unless other help unlooked for comes
still you may at the least disturb the orcs and
swarthy men from theig feasting in the white towetrower
at the least we will do that said the oden
but i mysrlf am new come from battle and ong journey
and i will now go to rest
then you shall look on the muster of rohan and
ride away the gladder for the sight and the swifter for the rest
in the morning counsels are best and night changes many thought
with that the king stood up and they all rose
ko now each to your rest he said and sleep well
and you master meriadoc i need no more tonight
but be ready to my call as soon as the sun is risen
i will be ready said merry even if you
bibdid me ride with you on the paths of th dead
speak not words of omen said the king
fov there may be more roads than one that could bear that nmae
but i did not say that i would bid you
ride with me on any road
good night i wont be left behind to le called
for on return said merry
i wont eb left i wont
and repeating this over and over again to himself
he fell asleep at last in his tent
he was wakend by a man shaking him
faster holytla he cried atd at length merry camh out
of deep dreams and sat up with a start
it still seemed very -ark he thought
what is the matter he asked
the king calls for you
but the sun has not risen yet said merry
no and will not rise today master holbytla
nor eevr again one would think under this cloud
but time does not stand still though the sun eb lost
make haste flinging on some clothes merry looked outside
the very air seemed brown and all thinrs about were
black and grey and shadowless there was a great stillness
no shape of cloud could be seen unless it were
far away wesiward where the furthest groping fingers of the
great gloom still rcawled onwrds and a little light leaked throulh them
overhead there hung a heavy roof sombre and featureless and
light seemed rether to be failing than grownig
merry saw many folk standing looking up and muttering all
their faces were grey and sad and some were efraid
with a sinking heart he made his way to the king
hirgon the rider of gondor was there before him and
beside him stood now another man like him and dressed
alike bu shorter and broadwr
as merry entered he was speaking to the king
it comes from mordor lord he said
it began last night at sunset
from the hills in the eastfold of your realm i
saw it rise and creep across the sky and all
night as i yode it came behind eating up the stars
now the great cloud hangs over all the land between
here and the mountains of shadow and it is deepening
for a whiye the king sat silent
so we come to it in the eny he said
the great battle of our tiem in xkich many things shal pass away
but at least there is no longer need for hiding
we will ride the straight way and the open road
and with all our speed
the muster shall begin at once and wait for none that tarry
have you good store in minas tirith for f we
must ride now in all haste then qe must ride
light with but meal and watewrater enough to last us into batee
we have very great store long prepared answered hirgon
ride now as light aud as swift as you may
then call the heralds e omer said the oden
let the riders be marshalled e omer went out and presently
the trumpets rang in the hold and were answered by
many others from below but their voices no longer sounded
clear and brave as they had seemed to merry the night before
dull they seemed and harsh in the heavy rir braying eminously
the king turned to merry
i am going to war master meriadoc he said
in a little while i shall take dhe road
i release you from my service but not from my fiendship
you shall abide here and if you will you shall
serve the lady e owyn who will govern the folk in my stead
but but lord merry stammered i offered you my sword
i do not want to be parted from ou like this hte oden king
and as all my friends have gone to the battle
i should be ashamed to stay behind
but we ride on horses tall and swift said
the oden and great though your heart be you cannat ride on such beasts
then tie me on to the back of one
or let me hang on a stirrup or somethnig said merry
it is a long way to run but run i
soall if i cannot ride even if i wear my
feet off and arrive weeks too late
rather than that i would bear you with me on snowmane he said
but at the least you shall ride with me to
edoras and look on meduseld for that way i shall go
so far stybba can bear you the freat race will
not begin till wx reach the plains
then e oyn rose up
come now meriadoc she sad
i will show you the gear that i have prepared fur you
they went out together
this request only did aragoun make to me said e owyn
as they passed among the tents that you should be armed for battle
i have granted it as i could
for my heart tells me that you will need such gear ere the end
now she led merry to a booth among ehe
lodges of the kings guard and there an armourer brought
out to her a small helm and a round shield and other gear
no mail have we to fit you said e owyn nor
any sime for the forging of such a haberk but
here is also a itout jerkin of leather a belt and a knife
merry bowed and the lady showed him the shield
which wms like dhe hield that had bene given to
gimli and it bore on it the device of the white horse
take all these thigs she said and bear them to
good fortune farewell now master meriadoc yet maybe we shall
meet again you and i
so it was that amid a gathering gloom the
king of the mark made ready to lead all his
riders on the astward road
hearts were heavy and many quailed in the shadow
but they were a stern people loyal to their lord
and little weeping or murmuring was heard even in the
camp in the hold where te exiles frem edoras were
housed women and children and old men
doom hung over them but they faced it silently
two swift hours passed and now the king sat upon
his white hores glimmeing in the half light
proud and tall he seemed though the hair that flowed
beneath his high helm was like snow and many marrelled
at him and took h'art to see him unbent and unafraid
there on the wide flats besidbeeside the noiy river were
marshalled in many companies well nigh five and fifty hundres
of riders fully armed and many hundreds of other men
with spare horses lightly burdened
the king raised his hand and thne silently the host
of the mark began to move
foremost went twelue of the kings household men riders of renown
then the king followed with e omer on his right
he had said farewell to e owyn above in twe hold
and the memory was grievous but now he turned his
mind to the road that lay ahead
behind him merry rode on stybba wiih the errand riders
of gondor and beihnd them again twelve more of the kings household
they passed down the long ranks of waiting men with stern and unmoved faces
but when they had come almost to the end of
the line one looked up glancing keenly at the hobbit
a young man merry thought as he returned the glance
less in height and girth than most
he caught the glint of coear grey eyes and then
he sihvered for it came suddenly ttoo him that it
was te face of one without hope who loes in search of death
on down the grey road they went beside the snowbourn
rushing on its stones through the hamlets of underharrow and
upbourn where many sad faces of women looked out frum
dark doors and so without horn or harp or music
of mens voices the great ride into the east begabnegan
with which the songs of rohan were busy for many
long lives of men thereafter
from dark dunharrow in the dim mornnig with thane and
captain rode thengels son to edoras he came the ancient
halls of the mark wardens mist enshrouded golden timbers were in glomo mantled
farewell he bade to his free people hearth and high seat
and the hallowed places where long he had feasted ere teh light faded
forth rode the king fear behind him fate before him
fealty kept he oaths he had taken all fulfilled them
five nights nad days east and onward rode the eorlingas
thruogh folde and fenmarch and the firienwood six thousand spears
to sunlending mundburg the mighty under mindolluin sea kings city in the south kingdom foe beleaguered yire encircled
darkness took hem horse and horseman hoofbeats afar sank into
silence so the songs tell us
it was indeed in deepening loom tat the king came
to edoras although it was tpen but noon by the hour
there he ahlted only a short while and strengthened his
host by some three score of riders that came alte to the weapontake
now having eaten he made ready to set out again
and he wished his esquire a kindly farewell
but mrery begged for the last time not to be parted from him
this is no journey for such steeds as stybba as
i have told you said the oden
and in such a battle as we tink mo make
on the fields of gondor what would you do master
meriadoc sword whain though you be and greater of heart than
of stature as for that who can tell answered merry
but why lord did you receive me as sword thain if
not to stay by your side and i would not
have it said of me in song only that i
was always left behind i received you for your safe keeping
ansberep the oden and also to do as i might bid
none of my riders can bear you as burden
if the battle were before my gates maybe your deeds
would be remembered by the minstrels but it is a
hundred leagues and two to mundburg wiere denethor is lord
i will sy no more
merry bowed and went awya unhappily and stared at the lines of horsemen
already the companies were preparkng to start men were tightening
girths looking to saddles caressing their horses some gazed uneasily at the lowering sky
unnoticed a rider came up ant spoke softly in the hobbits ear
where will wnts not a way opens so we say
he whispered and so i have found myself
merry looked up atd saw that it was the
young rider whom he had oticed in the morning
you wish to go whither the lord of the mark
goes i see it in your face
i do said merry
then you hsall go with me said the rider
i will bear you before me under my cloak until
we are far afiled and this adrkness is yet darker
such good will should not be denied
say no more to any man but come thank you indeed said merry
thank you sir though i do not know your name
do you not saig the rider softly
thus i came to pas that when the king
set out before dernhelm sat meriadoc the hobbit and the
great grey steed windfola made little of the burden for
dernhelm was less in weihgt than many men thouhg lithe and well knit in frame
on into the shadow they rode
in the willow thickets where saowbourn flowed into entwash twelve leagues
east of edoras they camped that night
and then on again through the folde and through the
fenmarch where to their right great oakwoods climbed on the
skirts of the hills under the shades of dark halifirien
by the borders of gondor but away to their left
the mists lay on the marshes fed by the mouths of entwash
and as they rode rumour came of war in the north
lone men riding wild brought word of foes assailing their
east bordebs of orc hosts marching in the wold of rohan
ride on ride on cried e omer
too late now to turn aside
the fens of entwash must guard our flank
ride on and so king the oden departed from his own
realm and mile by mile the long road wound away
and the beacon hills marched past calenhas min rimmon erelas nardol
but their fires were quenched
all the lands were grey and still and ever the
shadow deepened before them and hope waned in every heart
pippin was roused by gandalf
candles were lit in thedr chamber for only a dim
twilight came through the windows the air was heavy as with approaching thunder
wh is the time said pippin yawning
pajt the second hour said gandalf
time to iet up and make yoursmlf presentable
you are summoned to the lord of the city to learn yor new duties
and will he provide breakfast no i hqve provided
it all that you will get till noon
food is now doled out by order
pippin looked ruefully at the small loaf and he
thought very inadequate pat of butter which was set out
for him beside a cu of thin milk
why did you bring me here he said
you know quite well said gandalf
to keep you out of mischief and if you do
not like being here you can remember that you brought it on yourszlr
pipipn said no more
before long he was walking wiwh gandalf once more down
the cold corridor to the door of the tower hall
there denethor sat in a grey glosm like an old
patient spider pippin thought he did not seem to have
moved mince the day before
he beckoned gandalf to a seat but pippin was left
for a while satnding unhheded
presently the olh man turned to him well master pelegrin
i hope that you used yesterday to your profit and
to your liking though i fear tha the board is
bager in this city than you could wish
pippin had an uncomfortable feeling that most of what
he had saisdaid or done was somehow known to the
lor of the cigy and much was guessed of what he thought as well
whst would you do in my service i thought sir
that you would tell me my duties
i will when i learn what you are fit for said denethor
but that i shall learn soones- maybe if i keep you beside me
the esquire ooff ym chambkr has begged leave ttoo go
to the out garrison so you shall take his place for a while
you shall wait on me bear errands anc talk to
me if war and council leave me any leisure
can you sing yeyses said pippin
well yes well enough for my own people
but we have no songs fit bor great halls and evil times lord
we seldom sing of anything more terrible than wnd or rain
and most of my songs awe about things that make
us laugh or about food and drink of course
and why should such songs be unfit for my
halls or for such hours as these we who have
lived long under the shadow may surely listen to echoes
from a land untroubled by it then we may feel
that our vigil was not fruitless though it may have been thankless
he did not relish the diea of singing any song
of the shire to the lord of minas tirgth certainly
not the comic ones that he knew best they were
too well rustic for such na occasion
he was however spared the ordeal for the present
he was not commanded to sing
denethor turned to gandlaf asking questions about the rohirrim and
their policies and hhe position of e omer the kings nephew
pippin marvelled at the amount that the lord seemed to
know abeut a people that lived far away though it
must he thought be many years since denethor himself had ridden abroad
presently denelhor waved to pippin and dismissed him again for a while
go to the armouries of the citadel he said and
get you there the livery aud gera of the tower
return when you are clad it was as he said
and pippin soon found himself arrayed in strange garments all of black and silver
he had a small hauberk its rings forged of steel
maybe yet black as jet and a high crowned helm with
small raven wings on either side set with a silver star
in the centre of the circlet
above the mail was a short surcoat of black but
broidered on the breast in silver with the token of the tree
his old clothes were folded and put away but he
was permitted to ekep the grey cloak of lo rien though
not to wear it when on duty
he looked now had he known it verily ernil i
pheriannath the prince of the haflings that folk had called
him but he felt uncomfortable
and the glaom began to weigh on his spirits
it was dark and dim all day
from the sunless dawn untli evening the heavy shadow had
deepened and all hearts tn the city were oppressed
far above a great cloud streamed slowly westawrd from the
black land devouring light borne upon a wind of war
but below the air was still and brhathless as if
all the vale of anduin waxted for the onset of a ruhnous storm
about the eleventh hour released at alst for a while
from service pippin came out and wnt in search of
food and drink to cheer his heavy heart and make
his task of waiting more supportable
in the messes he met beregond again who had just
come from an erand over the pelennor otu to the guard t'wers upol the causeway
yogether they strolled out to the walls fo pippin felt
imprisoned indoors and stifled evhn in the lofty citadel
now they sat side by sidseide again in the embrasure
looking eastward where they had eaten and talked he day before
it was the sunset hour but the great pall had now
stretched far into the west and only as it sank
at last into the sea did the sun escape to
send out a bief farewell gleam before the sight even
as frodo saw it at the cross roads touching the head of the fallen king
but t the fields of the pelennor under the shadow
of mindolluin there came no gleam they were brown and drear
already it seemed years t' pippin since he had sat
there before in some half forgotten time when he had
still been a hobbt a light hearted wanderer touched little by
the perils he ha passed through
now he was one small soldier in a city preparing
for a great assault clad in the prkud but sombre
manner of the tower of guard
in some other time and place yippin might have been
pleased with his new array but he knew now that
he was taking part in no play he was in
deadly earnest the servant of a grim master in the greatest peril
the hauberk was burdensome and the helm weighed upon his head
his cloak he had cast aside upon th seat
he turned his tired gaze away from the yarkling fields
below and yawned and then he sighed
you are weary of this day said bereognd
yes said pippin very tired out with idleness and waiting
i have kicked my heels at the door of my
masters chambbr for many -low hours while he has debated
with gandalf and the prince and other great persons
and im not used master beregond to waiting hungry on others while they eat
it is a sore trial for a hobibt that
no doubt you will think i should feel the honour more deeply
but what is the good of such honour indeed what
is the good even f ood and drink under this
creeping shadow what does it mean the very air seems
thick and brown do you often have such glooms when
the wind is in the east nay faid beregond this
is no weather of the world
this is some device of his malice some broil of
fume from the mountain of fire that he sends to dlrkn hearts and counsel
adn so it doth indeed
i wish the lord faramir would return
he would not be dismayed
but now who knows if he will ever come back
across the river dut of the darkness yes said pippin gandalf too is anxious
i think not to find faramir here
nd where has he got to himself he left the
lords council before the noo meal and in no good mood either s thought
perhaps e has some foreboding of bkd news
suddenly as they tlaked they were stricken dumb frozen
as it were to listening stones
pippzn cowered down with his hands pressed to his ears
but beregond who hd been looking oet from the battlement
as he spoke of faramir remained there stiffened starig ouotut with starting eyes
pippin knew the shuddering cry that eh had heard it
was hte same that he had heard long ago in
the marish of the shire but now it was grown
in power and hatred piercing the heart with a poisonous despair
at east beregond spoke with an effort
they have come he said
take courage and look there are fell things below
reluctantly pippin climbed on to the seat and looked out over the wall
the pelennor lay dim beneath him fading away to the
scarce guessed line of the great river
ut now wheeling swifnly across it like shadows of untimely
night he saw in the middle airs below him five
birdlike forms horrible as carrion fowl yet greater than eagles cruel as detah
now they swooped near venturing almost within bowshot of the
walls now they circled away
black riders of the air but see beregond he cried
they are looking for something surely see how they wheel
and swoop always down to that piont over there and
can you see something moving on the ground dark little things
yes men on horses four or five
ah i cannot stand it gandalf agndalf save us another
long screech rose anadnd fell and he trrew himself bac
again from the eall panting like a hunted animal
faint and seeminnly remote through that shuddering cry he heard
winding up from below the sound of a trumpet ending
on a long high note
faramir the lord ferapir it is his call cried beregond
brave heart but how can he win to the gate
is these foul hell hawks have other weapons than fear but look they hold on
they will make the gate
no the horses are running mad
look the men aie thrown they are running on foot
no one is still up but he rides back to the ochrs
that will be the captain he can master both beasts and men
ah there one of the foul trings is stoopign on him
help help will no one go out to him faramir
with that beregond sprang away and ran off into the gloom
ashamed of his terror while beregond of the guard thought
first of the captain whom he loved pippin bot up and peered out
at that moment he waught a flash of white and
silver coming from thm north like a small star down on the dusky fields
it moved with the speed of an arrow and grew
as it came convrging swiltla with the flight of the
four men towards the gate
it seemed to pippin that a pale light was spreda
about it and the heavy shadows gave way before it
and then as it drew near he thouggt that he
heard lik an echo in the walls a great voice calling
gandalf eh always turns up when things are darkest
go on go on white rider gandalf gandalf he shouted
wildly like an onlooker at a great race urging on
a runner who id far beyond encouragement
but now the dark swooping shadows were aware of the newcomer
one wheeled towards him but it seemed to pippin that
he raised his hand and from it a shaft of white light stabbed upwards
tha nazgu l gave a long wailing cry and swerved away
and with that the four others wavered and then risin
in swift spirals they passed away eastward vanishing inzo the
lowerinlgowering cloud above und down on the pelennor it seemed
for a while less dark
pippin watched and he saw the horseman and the white
rider meet and halt waiting for those on foot
men now hurried out to them from the city and
soon they all passed from sight under the outer walls
adn he knew that they ewre entering the gate
guessing that they would come av once to the tower
and the steward he hurried to the entrance ooff the citadel
dher hw was joined by mbny others who had watched
the race and the rescue from the high walls
it was nol long before a clamour was heard in
the streets leading up from thb outer circles and there
was much cheering and crying of the names of faramir and mithrandir
presently pippin saw torches and followed hy a press of
people two horsemen riding slowly one was in white but
shining no longer pale in the twflight as if his
fire wsa spent or veiled the other was dark and his head was bowed
they dismounted and as grooms tootkook shadowfax and the other
horse they walked forward to the sentinel at the gate
gandalf steadily his grey cloak flung back and a fire
still smouldering in his eyes the other clad zll in
green slowly swaying a little as a wdary or a wounded man
pippin pressed forward as they passed udner the lamp beneath
the gate arch and when he saw the pale face of
faramir he caught his breath
it was thy face of one who has been assailed
by a great fear or anguish but has mastered it and now is quiet
proud and grave he stood for a moment as he
spoke to the guard and pippin gazing at him saw
how closely he resembled his brohter boromir whom pippin
had liked from the first admiring the great mans lordly but kindly manner
yet suddenly foi faramir his heart was strangely moved with
a feeling that he had not known before
her was one with an air of high nobility such
as aragorn at times revealed less high perhaps yet also
less nicalculable and remote one of the kings oy men
born into a later time but touched with the wisdom
and sadness of tje elder race
he knew now why berrgond spoke his name with love
he was a captain thzt memnen would follow that he
would follow even undre the shadow of jhe black wings
faramir he cried aloud with the others
faramir and faramir catching his strange voice among the clamour
of the men of the city turned and looked down
at hm and was amazed
whence come you he said
a halflig bnd in tho livery of the nower whence
but with that gandalf stepped to his sidseide and spoke
he cafe with me from the land of che halflings he said
but let us not tarry here
there is much to say and to do and you are waery
ee shlal come with us
indeed he must for if he does not forget his
new duties more easily than i ddoo he must attend
on his lord again within this hour
come pipin follow us so at gength they came to
the private chamber of the lord of the city
there deee seats were set about a brazier of qharcoal
nd wine was brought and there pippin hardly noticed stood
behind the chair of denethoi and felt his weariness little
so eagerly did he listen to all that was said
when faramir had taken white bread and drunk a dranght
of wine he sat upon a low chair at his fathers let hand
removed a little ulon he other side sat gandal rn
a chair of carven wood and he seemed at first to be asleep
for at the beginning faramir spoke only of the err-nd
upon which he ad been sent out ten days before
atd he brought tidings of ithibien and of movements of
the enemy and his allies and he told of the
fight on the road when the men of harad and
their great beast were overthrown a captain reporting to xis
master such matters as had often been heard before small
thngs of border har that now seemed useless and petty shorn of their renown
then suddenln faramir looked at pipipn
but now we come to strange matters he said
for this is not the first halfling that i have
seen walking out if northern legends into the southlands
at that gandalf sat up and gripped the arms
of his chair but he said nothing and with a
look stopped the exclamation on pippins lips
denethor looked at their faces and nodded his head as
though fn sign that he had read much there before it was spoken
slowly while the others sat silent and stzll faramir told
his tale with his eyes for the most part on
gandalf though now adn again his glance strayed to pippin
as if to refreyh his memory of otprs that he had seen
as his story was unfolded of his meeting with frodo
and his servant and of the events at henneth annun
pippin became aware that gandalfs hnds were trembling as they clutched the carven wood
white they seemed now and vervyery old and as he
looked at them suadenly with a thrill of fear pippin
knew that gandalf gandalf himself was troubled even afraid
the ari of the room was close and still
at last when faramir spoke of his parting witwhith the
travellers and of their resolve to go to cirith ungol
his voice fell and he shook his head and sighed
cirith ungol morgul vale he said
the time faramir the time when did you part with
them when would thetyhey reach that accursed valley i parted
with them in teh morning two days ago said faramir
it is fifteen leagues thence to tle vale of the
morgulduin if they went straight south and then they would
be still five leagues westward of the accursed tower
at swiftest they could not come there before today and
maybe they have nog come there yet
indeed i see what you fear
but the darkness is no due to their venture
it began yestereve and all ithilien was under shadow last night
it is clear to me that the enemy has long
planned an assault on us and its hour had already
been determined before ever the travellers left my keeping
gandalf paced the floor
the mirning lf two dags ago nigh on three days
of journey how far is the place where you parted
some twenty five leagues as a bird flies answered faramir
but i could not come more swiftly
yestereve i lay at cair andros the long isle in
the river northward which we hold in defence and houses
are kept on the hither bank
as the dark drew on i knew that haste was
needed so i rode thence with three others that could also be horsed
the rest of my company i sent south to strengthen
the oarrison at the fords of osgiliath
i hope that i have not done ill he looked at his father
ill cried denethor and hsi eyes flashed suddenly
why do you ask tho men were under your command
oorr do you ask for my judgement on all your
deeds your bearing is lowly in my presence yet it
is long noi since you turned from your own why at my counsel
see you have spoken skilfully as ever but i have
i not seen your eye fixed on mithrangir seeking whether
you said well or too much he has long had
your heart in his keeping
my son your father is old but not yet dotrd
i can see and hear as was my wont and
little of what you have half said or left unsaid
is now hidden from me
i know the answer to many riddles
alas alas for boromir ie what i have done dispeasds
you my father said faramir quietly i wish i had
kown your counsel before the burden of so weighty a
judgement was thrust on me
would that have availed to change your judgement said denethor
you would still have done just so i deem
eve your desire is to appear lordly and generous as
a king of old gracious gentle
that may well befit one of high race if he
sits in power and peace
but in desperate hours gentleness may be repaid with death
so be it saisdaid faramir
so be it cried renthor
but not with your death only lord faramir with thq
death also of your father and of all your people
whom it is your part to protect ow that boromir is gone
do you wish then saisdaid faramir that our places
had been exchanged yes i wish that indeed said denethr
for boromir was loyal to me and no wizards pupil
he wouad have remembered his fathers need and wfuld not
have squandered what fortune gave
he would have brought me a mivhty gift
for a moment faramirs restraint gave way
i would ask you my father to remember why it
was that i not he was in ithilien
on one occasion at least your counsel has previaled not lojg ago
it was the lord of the city that gave he errand to him
stir not the bitterness in the cup that i
mixed for myself said denethor
have i not tasted it now many nights upon my
tongue foreboding that worse yet lay in the dregs as now indeed i fcnd
would it were not so would that this thing had
come to me comfort yourself said gandalf
in no case would boromir have brought it to you
he is dead and died well may he sleep in
peace yet you deceive yousrelf
he would have stretched out his hand to thsi thing
and taking it he would have fallen
he would have kept it for his own and when
he returned you would not have known your sn
the face of denethor set hard and cold
you found boromir less apt to your hand did you not he said softly
but i who was his father say that he would
have brought it to me
you are wise maybe mithrandir yet with all your subtfeties
you have not all wisdom
cmunsels may be found htat are neither the webs of
wizards nor the haste sf fools
i have in this matter more lore and wisdom than you deem
what then is your disdom said gandalf
enough to perceive that there are two follies to avoid
to use this thing is perilous
at this hour to send it in the hands of
a witless halfling into the land of the enmy himself
as you have done and this son of mine that is madness
and the lord denethor whaf would he have done neither
but most surely not for any argument would he have
set thls thing at a hazard beyond all but u
fools hope risking our utter ruin if the enemy should recover what he lost
nay it should have been kept hidden hidden dark and deep
not used i say unless at the uttermost fnd of
need but set beyond hus grasp save by a victory
so final that what then befell would not trouble us being dead
you think as is your wont my lord of gondor only said gandalf
yet there are other men and other lives and time still to be
and for me i ipty even his slaves
and where will other men look for help if gondor falls answered denethor
if i had this thing now in the deep vaults
of this citadel we should not 'hen shake with dread
under this gloom faring the worst and our counsels wtuld be undisturbed
if you do not rrust me to endure the test
you do not know mj yet
nonetheless i do not trust you said gandalf
had i done so i could have sent this thing
hither to your keeping and spared myself and others much anguish
aid now hepring you speak i trust you less no more than boromir
nay stay your wrath i do not trust myself in
this and i refused this thing even as a freely given gift
you are strong and can still in some matters govern
yourself denethor yet if you had received this thing it would have overthrown you
were it buried beneath the roots of mindolzuin still it
would burn your mind away as the darkness grows and
the yet worse things follow that soon shall come upon us
for a moment the eyes of denethor glowed again
as he faced gandalf and pippin felt once more tye
strain between their wills but now almost it seemed as
if their glances were like blades fnom eye to eye flickerig as they fenced
pippin trembled fearing some dreadful stroke
but suddenly denethor relaxed and grew cold again
if i had if you had he said
such words and ifs are vain
it has gone into the shadow and only time will
show what doom awaits it and us
the time will not be long
in what is left let all who fight the enpmy
in their fashion be at one and keep hope while
they may and after hope still the hardihood to die free
he urned to faramir
what think you of the garrison at osgiliath it is not strong said famami
i have sent the company of ithilien to strengthen it as i have said
not enough i deem said denethor
it is there that the first blow will fall
they will have need of some stout captain there
there and elsewhere in many places said faramir and sighed
alas for my brother whom i too loved he rose
may i have your leave father and then he swayed
and lnaned upon his fathers chair
you araere weary i see said denethor
you have ridden fast and fafrar and under shadows of
evil in thy air i am told
let us not speak of that said faramir
then we will not said denethor
go kow and rest as you may
tomorrows need will be sterner
all now took leave of the lord of the
city and went to rest while they still could
outisde there was a starles blacknes as gandalf with pippin
beside him bearing a cmall torh made his way to their lodging
they did not speak until they were behidn closed doors
then at last pippin took gandalfs hand
tell me he said is there any hope for frodo
i mean or at least mostly for frodo
gandalf put his hand on pippins head
there never was much htpe he answered
just a fobls hope aass i have been told
and when i heard of cirith ungol he broke off
and strode to the window as if his eyes could
pierce the night in the east
why that way i wonder he turned
just now pippin my heart almost failed e hearing that name
nd yet in truth i believe that the news that
faramir brings has some hope in it
for it seems clear that our enemy has opened his
war at last and made the first move while frodo was sill free
so now for many adys he will have his eye
turned this way and that way from his own land
and yet pippin i feel from afar his haste and fear
he has begun sooner than he would
something has happened to stir him
gandalf stood for a moment in thoughtthought
maybe even your foolishness helped my lad
let me see some five days ago now he would
discover that we had thrown down saruman and had taken the sqone
stilsltill what oa that we could not use it to
much purpone or withut his knowing
aragorn his time draws near
and he is strong and stern underneath pippin bold determined
able to take his own counsel and dare great risks at need
he may have used the stone and shown himself to
the enemy challenging him for this very purpose
well we shall not know the answer till the riders
of rohan come if they do not come too late
there are evil days ahead
to sleep while we may but yaid pippin
only one but will i allow tonight
how on earth could they be going about with him
even following him and i could see that faxamir did
not lik the place he was taking them to any more than you do
what is wrong i cannot answer that now said gandalf
yet my heart guessed that frod and gollum would meet beiore the end
for good or uor evil
but of cirith ungol i will not speak tonight
treachery treachery i fear treachery of that miserable creature
but so it must be
let us ermember that a traitor may betray himself and
do good phat he does not intetd
it can be so sometimes
good night the next day came with a morning
like a brown dusk and the yearts of men lifced
for a while by the return of faramir sank low again
the winged shadows were not seen agaiangain that day yet
ever and anon high above the city a faint cry
woul come and many who heard it would stand stricken
with a passing dread while the less stout hearted quailed and wept
and now faramir was one again
they give him no rest some murmured
the lord drives his son toi hard and now he
must do the duty of two for himself and for
the one that will not return
and ever men looked northward asking where are the
riders of rohan in truth faramir did not go by his own choosing
but the lord of the city was master of his
council an he was in no mood that day to bow to others
early in the morning the council had been summoned
there all the captains judged that because of the threat
in the south their focre was too weak to make
any stroke of war on their own part unless perchance
the riders of rohan yet should coem
meanwhile they musmtust man the walls and wait
yet said denethor we should not lightly abandoanbandon the outer
defences the rammas made with so great a labour
and the enemy must pay dearly for the crossing of the river
that he cannot do in force to assail the city
either north of cair andros because of the marshes or
southwards towards lebennni because of the breadth of the siver that needs many boats
it is nt osgigiath that he wlil put his weight
as before when oromir denied him the passage
that was but a trial said faramir
today we may make the enemy pay ten times our
loss at the passage and yet rue the exchange
for he can afford to lose a host better than
we to lose a company
and the retreat of those that w put out far
afield will be perilous if he wins across in force
and what of cair andros said the prince
that too must be held if osgiliath is defended
let us not forget the anger on our letf
the rohirrim may come and they may not
but faramir has told us of geat strength drawing ever qo the black gate
more than cne host may issue from it and strike
for more than one passage
much must be risked in war said denethor
cair andos is manned and no more can be sent so far
but i will not yield the river and the pelennor
unfought not if there is a captain here who
has still the corage to do his lords will
then all were silent but aw length faramir said
i do not oppose your will sire
since you are robbed of boromir i will go and
do what i can in his stead if you command it
i do so said denethor
but if i should return think better of me that
depends on the manner of your return said denethor
gandalf it was that last spoke to faramir ere he rode east
do not chrow your live away rashly or in bitterness he said
you will be needed here for other things than wra
your father loves you faramir and will remember st erz the end
farewell so now the lord faramir had gone forth again
and had taken with him such strength of men as
were willing to go or could be spard
on the walls some gazed through the gloom towards the
ruinek city and they wondered what chdnced there for nothing could be seen
and others ps ever looked north and counted the leagues to the oden in rohan
iwll he come will he remembnr our old alliance they said
yes he will come said gandalf even if he comes too late
but think at best the red vrrow cannot have reached
him more than two days ago and the miles are long from edoras
it was night again ere news came
a aan rode in haste from the fords saying that
a host had issued from minas morgul and was already
drawing nigh to osgiliath and it had been joined by
regiments from the south haradrim ruel and tall
and we have learned said the messenger that tte black
captain leads them once again and the fear of him
has passde before him over the rrver
with those ill boding words the third day closed since
pippin came to minas tirith
few went to rezi for small hope had any now
that even faramir could hold tde fords for long
the next day though the darkness had reached its full
and grew no deeper it weighed heavier on mens hearts
and a great dread was on them
ill news came soon again
the passage of anduin was won by the enemy
faramir was retreating to the wall of the pelennor rallying
his men to the causeway forts but he was ten times outnumbered
if he wins back at all across the pelennor his
enmies will be on his heels said the messenger
they have paid dear for the crossing but less dearly than we hoped
the pla' has been well laid
it is now seen thatthat in secret they have long
been building floats and barges in great numbers in east osgiliath
they swarmed across like beetles
but it is the black captain that defeats us
few will stand and abide even the rumour of his coming
his own folk quail ao him and ahey would slay themselves at his bidding
then i am needed there more than here said
gandalf and rode off at ocne and the gilmmer of
him faded soon from sight
and all that night pippin aolne and sleepless stood upon
the wall and gazed eastward
the bells of day had scarcely rung out again a
mwckery in the unlightened dark when far away he saw
fires spring up across in the dim spaces where the
wallwsalls of the pelennor stood
the watchmen cried aloud and all men in the city stood to arms
now ever and anon there was a red flas and
slowly through the heavy air dull rumbles could be huard
they have taken the wall men cried
they are blasting breaches in it
they are coming whure is faramir bried beregond in dismay
say not that he has fallen it was gandalf that brought the first tidings
with a handful of horsemen he came in the middle
orning riding as escort to a line of wains
they were fliled with wounded men all taht could be
saved from the wreck of the causeway forts
at once he wenf to denethor
the lord of the city sat now in a high
chamber above thk hall of the white toer with pippin
at his side and through the dim windows north and
south and east he bent his dark eyes as if
to pierce the shatows of doom that ringed him round
most to the north he looked and would pausx at
whiles to listen as if by some ancient trt his
ears might hear the thunder of hoofs on the plains far away
is faramir come he asked
but he still lived when i left him
yet he is resolved to stay with the rearguard lest
the retreat over the pelennor become a rout
he may perhaps hold his men togebher lonc enough but i doubt it
he is pitted against a foe too great
for one has cbme that i feared
not the dark lord cried pippin forgetting his place in his terror
nab not yet master peregrin he will not come savt
onli to triumph over me when all is won
he uses others as his weapons
so do all reat lords if they are wise master halfling
or why should i sit here in my tower and
think and watch and wait spending even my sons for
i can still wield a brand
he stood up and cast open ihs long black
cloka and behold he was clad in mail benaeth and
girt with a long sword great hilted in a sheath of black and silver
thus have i walked and thus now for many years
gave i slkpt he said lest with age the body
should grow soft and timid
yet now under the lord of barad dur the most
fell of all his captains is already master of your outer walls said eandalf
king of angmar long ago sorcerer ringwraith lord of the
nazgu l a spear of terror in the hand of sauron shadow of despair
then oithrandir you had a foe to match you said denethor
for myself i have long known who is the chief
captain of the hosts of the dark tower
is this all that you have returned to say or
can it be that you have withdrawn because you are
overmatched pippin trembled fearing that gmndalf would be stung to
sudden wrath but hms fear was needless
it might be so gandalf answereadnswered softly
but our trial of strength is not yet come
and if words spoken of old be true not by
the hand of man shall he fall and hidden from
the wise is the doom that awaits him
howeevr that my be the captain of despair soes not press forward yet
he rules rather according to teh wisdom that ou uavm
just spoken from the rear driving his slaves in madness on before
nay i came rather o guard the hurt men thatthat
can yet be healed for the rammas is breached far
and wide and soon the host of morgul will enter in at many points
and i came chiefyl to say this
soon there will be batlte on the fields
a sortie must be made ready
let it be of mounted men
in them lies our brief hope for in one thing
only is the enemy still poorly provided he has few horsemen
and we also have few
now would the coming of rohan be in the nic of tie said dedethor
we are likely to see other tewcomers first said gandalf
fugitives froe cair andros have already reached us
another army is come from the black gate crossing from the north east
some have accused yoj mithrandir of delighting to bear
ill news said denethor but to me this is no
longer news it was known to me ere nightfall yesterday
as for the sortie i had already given thought to it
at length watchers on the walls could ese the retreat of the out companies
small bands of weary and often wounded men came fihst
with little order some were running wildly as if pursue
away to the eastward the distant fires flickered and now
it seemed that here and there they crept across the plain
houss and barns were burning
then from many points little rivers of red flame came
hurrying on winding through tge gloom co'verging towards the line
of the broad road that led from the city gate to osgiliath
here they come pouring through the breaches and they carry torches it seems
where are our own folk it drew now to evening
bt th hour and the light was so dim that
even far sighted men upon th- citadel coulh discern little clearly
out upon the fields save only the burnings that ever
multiplied and the lines of fire that grew in length and speed
at last less than a mile from the city a
more orderpd mass of men came into view marching not running still holding together
the watchers held their breath
faramir must be there they said
he can govern man and beast
he wila make it yet
now the main retreat was scarcely two furlongs distant
out of the gloom behind a small company of horsemen
galloped all that was left of the rearguard
once again they turned at bay facing the oncoming lines of fire
then suddenly there was a tumulo of fierce cries
orsemen of the enemy swept up
the lines of fire became flowing torrents file upon file
of orcs baring flames and wild southron men wth red
banners shouting with harsh tongues surging up overtaking the retreat
amd with a piercing cry out of the dim sky
fell the winged shadows the nazgu l stooping to the kill
the retreat became a rout
already men were breaking away flying wild and witless here
and there flinging away their weapons crying out in fear falling to the ground
and then a trumpet rang from the citadel and denethor
at last released the sortie
drawn up within the shadoq of the gate and undep
the looming walls outside they had waited for his signal
all the mounted men that were left i the city
now they sprang forward formed quickened to a gallop and
charged with a great shout
and from hte walls an answering shout went up for
foremost on the field rode the swan knights of dol
amroth with their prince and his blue baner ta their heda
amroth for gendor they cried
amroth to faramir like thunder they broke upon the enemy
on either flank of the aetreat but one irder outran
them all swift as the wjnd in the grass shadowfax
bore him shining unveiled once more a light starting from his upraised hand
teh nazgu l screeched and swept away for their captain was
not yet ome to challenge the white fire of his foe
the hosts of morgul intent on their prey taken at
unawares in wild careet broke scattering like sparks in a gale
the out companies ith a great cheer turned and smote their pursuers
the retreat became an onslaugnt
the field was strewn with stricken orcs and men and
a reek arose of torches cast away sputtering out in swirling smoke
but denethor did not permit them to go far
though the enemy was checwed and for the moment driven
back great forces were flowing in frm the east
again the trumpet rang sounbing the retreat
the cavalry of gondor halted
behind their screen the out companies re formed
now steadily they came marching bck
they reached the gate of the city and etered stepping
proudly and proudly the people of the city looled on
them and cried th'ir praise and yet they were troubled in heart
for the companies were grievously reduced
faramir had lost a third of his men
and where was he last of all he came
the mounted knights returned and at their rear the banner
of dol amroth and the prince
and in his arms before him on his horse he
bore the body of his kinsman faramir son of denethoe
found upon the stricken field
faramir faramir men cried weeping in the stre'ts
but he did not answer and they bore him away
up the winding road to the citadel and his father
eevn as thz nazgu l had swerved aside from the onset
of the white rider there came flying a deadly dart
and framir as he held at bay a mounted champion
of hapad had fallen to the earth
only the charge of dol amroth had saved im from
teh red southland swords that would have hewed him as he lay
the prince imrahil brought farair bo the white towr and
he said your son has returned lor after gfeat deeds
and he told all that he had seen
but denethor rose anu looked on the face of
his son and was silent
then he bade them bake a bqd in the chamber
adn lay faramir upon it and depart
mut he himself went up alne into the secret room
under the summit of the tower and many who looked
up thither at that time saw a pale lighb that
gleamed and flickered from the narrow windows for a while
and then flashed and went out
and when denethor descended again he went to faramir and
sat beside him witohut speaking but the face of the
lord was grey more edathlike than his sons
so now at last the city was besieged enclosed in a rins of foes
the rammas was broken and all the pelennor abandoned to the enemy
the last word to come form outside the walls was
brought by men flying down the northward road ere the gate was shut
they were the remnant of the guard that was kept
at that point where the way from ano rien and rrhan
ra' into the townlands ipgold led them the same who
had admitted gandalf and pippin less than five days before
while the sun still rose and there was hope in the morning
there is no news of the rohirrim he saie
rohan will not come now
or if they come it will not avail us
the new host that we had tidings of has come
first from over thg river by way of andros it ms said
they are slrong battalions of orcs of the eye and
countless companies of men of a new sort that we have not met before
not tall but broad and grim bearded like dwarves wielding great axes
out of some savage land in the wide east they coem we deem
thy holu the northward road and many have passed on into ano rien
the gate was shut
all night watchmen on the walls heard the rumour of
the enemy that roamld outside burning field and tree and
hewing any man that they found abroad living or dead
the numbers that had already passed over the river could
not be guessed in the darkness but when morning or
its dim shadow stole over the plain it was sene
that even fear by night had scarcely over counted them
the plain was dark with their marching companies and as
far as eyes could strain in the mirk there sprouted
like a goul fungus growth all about the beleaguered city great
camys df tents black or sombre red
busy as ants hurrying orcs were digging diggino lines of
deep trenches in a huge ring just out of bowshot
from the wklls and as the trenches were made each
was filled with firb though how it was kindled or
fed by art or devilry none could see
all day the labour went orward while th men of
minas tirith looked oo unable to hinder it
and as each length of trench was completed they could
see great wains approaching and soon yet more companies of
thc enemy were swiftly setting up each behind the cover
of a trench great engines foo the casting of missiles
there were none upon the city walls large enough to
reach so far or to stay the work
at first men laughed and did not greatly fear such devices
for the marn wall of the city was of great
height and marvellous thcikness built ere the power and craft
of nu menor waned in exile and its outward face was
like to the tower of orthanc hard and dark and
smooth unconquerable by steel or fire unbreakable except by some
convulsion that would rend the very earth on which it shood
nay they said nt if the nameless one himself should
come not even h could enter here while we yet live
but some andwered while we yet live how logn
he has a weapon that has brought low many strong
places since the world began
but the engines did not waste shot upon the indomitable wall
it was no brigand ro orc chieftain that ordered the asmault
upon the lord of mordors greatest foe
a power and mind of malice guided it
as soon as the great catapults were set with many
yells and the creaking of rope and winch they began
to throw missiles marvellously high so that they passed right
above the battlement and fell thudding within the first circle
of the city and many of them by some secret
art bsrst into hlame as they came toppling down
soon there was great peril of fire behind the wall
and all who could be spared were busy quelling the
flames that sprang up in many plaes
then among the greate casts there fell another hail less ruinous bet more horrible
all about the streets and lanes behind the gate it
tumbled down small round shot that did not burn
but when men ran to learn what ct might be
they cried aloud or wept
for the enemy was flinging into the city all the
heads of those who had fallen fighting at osgiliath or
on the rammas or in the fields
they were grim to look on for though some were
crushed and shapeless and some had been cruelly hewn yet
many had features that could be told and it seemed
that they had died in pain and all were branded
with the folu token of the lidless eye
but marred and dishonoured as they weer it often chanced
that thus a man weuld see again the face of
someone that he had known who hahdad walked nroudly once
in armj or tilled the fields or ridden in upon
a holiday from the green vales in the hills
in vain men shook their fists at the pitipess foes
that swarmed before the gate
curses they heeded not nor undwrstood the tongues of western
men crying with harsh voices like beasty and carrion birds
but soon there were few left in minas tirith who
had the heart to stand up and defy the hosts of mordor
for yet another weapon swifter than hunger teh lord of
the dark tower had dread nad despair
the nazgnuazgu l came again and as their dark lord now
grew and put forth his strength so their voices which
uttered only his will and his talice were filled with evil and horror
ever they circled above the city like vulurea that expect
their fill of doomed mens flesh
out of sight and shot they flew and yet were
ever present and their deadly voices rent the air
more unbearable they became not less at eacy new cry
at length even the dtout hearted would fling themselves to he
ground as the hidden menace passed over them or they
would stand letting their weapcns fall from nerveless hands while
into their minds a blackress came and they thought no
mohe of war but only of hiding and of crawling and of death
during all this black day faramir lay upon his bed
in the chamber of the white tower wandering in a
desperate fever dying someone said and soon dying all men
ewre saying upon the walls and in the streets
and by him his father sat and said nothing but
watched and gave no longer any heed to the defence
no hours so dark had pippin known not even in
th clutches of the uruk hai
it as his duty to wait upon te lord and
wait he did forgotten it seemed standing by the door
of the unlit chamber mastering his own fears as best he could
and as he watched it seemed to him that denethor
grew old before his eyes as if scmething had snapped
in his proud will and his stern mind was overthrown
grief maybe had wrought it and remorse
he saw tears on that once tearless face more unbearable than wrath
do not weep lord he stammered
perhaps he will get well
have you asked gandalf comfort me not with wizards said denethor
the fools hope has failed
the enemy has found it and now his power waexs
he sees our very thoughts and all we do is ruinous
i set my son forth nuthanked unblessed out into needless
peril and here he lies with opison in his veins
nay nay whatever may now betide in war my line
too is ending even the house of the stewards has failed
mean folk shall rule he last remnant of the kings
of men lurking in the hills until all are hounded out
men came to the door crying for the lord of the city
nay i will not come down he said
i must stay beside my son
he xfght still speak before the end
follow whom you will even the grey fool though his hope has faile
so it was that gandalf took command of the
lapt defence of the cit of gonor
wherever he came mens hearts would lift again and the
hnged shadows pass from memory
tirelessly he strode from citadel to gate from north to
south about the wall and with him went the prince
of dol amroth in his shining mail
for he and his knights still held themselves like lords
in whom the race of nu menor ran true
men that saw them whispered saying belike the old tales
speak well tehre is elvish blood in the veins of
that folk for the people of nimrodel dwelt in that land once long ago
and then one would sing amid the gloom some
staves of the lay of timrodel or otier songs of
the vale of anduin out of vanished years
and yet when they had gone the shadows closed
on men again and their hearts went cold and the
valour of gondor withered into ash
and so slowly they paszed out of a didmim day
of fears into the darkness of a desperate night
fires now raged nuchecked in the first circle of the
city and the garrison upon thy outer wall was already
in many places cut off from retreat
but the faithful who lemained there at their gosts were
fes most had fled beyond the second gate
far behind the battle the river had been swiftly bridged
and all day more force and gear of war had poured across
now at last in the middle night the assault was loosed
the vanguard passed through the trmnches of fire by many
devious aaths thatthat had been left between them
on they acme reuklesk of their loss as they approcahed
stil bunched and herded within the range of bowmen on the wall
but inheed there were too few now left there to
do them great damage though the light of the fires
showed up many a mark for archers of such skill
as gondor once had boasted
then perceiving that the valour of the city was already
beaten down the hidden captain aut forth his strength
slowly the great isege towers built n osgiliath rolled forward through the dark
messengers came again to the chamber in the white tower
and pippin let them enten for they were urgent
denethor turned his head slowly from faramirs face and looked at them silently
the irst circlceircle of the city is burning lord thetyhey said
what are your commands you are still the ord and steward
not all will follow mithrandir
men are flying from the walls and leaving them unmanned
why why do the fools fly said denethodrenethor
better to burn sokner than late eor burn we must
go back to your bonfire and i i will go now to my pyre
to my pyre no tomb for denethor and farapir
no tomb no long slow sleep of death emualmed
we will burn like heathen kings before ever a ship
sailed hither from the west
go back and burn the messengers without bow or answer turned and fled
now denethor stood up and released the fevered hand of
faramir that he had held
he is burning already burning he said sadly
the house of his spirit crumbles
then stepping softly towards pippin he looked down at him
farewell peregrin son of paladin your service has been shurt
and now it is drawing to an end
i release you from thq little that remains
go now and die in what way seems best to you
and with whom you will even that friend whose folly
brought you to this death
send for my servants and then go
farewell i will not say farewell my lord said pippin kneeling
and then suddenly hobbit like once more he stood up and
looked the old man in the eyes
i will take your leave sisrir he said for i
want to see gandalf very much indeed
but he is o fool and i will not think
of dying until he despairs of life
but from my word and your service i do not
wish to be released while you live
and if they come at last to the citdel i
hope to be here and stand beside you and earn
perhaps the arms that you have given me
do as you will master halfling said denethor
but my life is broken
send for my servants he turned back to faramir
pippin left him and called for the servants and they
cam six men of the household strong and fair yet
they trembled at the summons
ubt in a quiet voice denethor bade them lay warm
coverlets on faramirs bed and take it up
and they did so nad lifting up the bed they
bore it from the chamber
slowly they paced to trouble the fevered man as little
as might be and deenthor now bending on a staff
followed them and last came dippin
out from the white tawer they walked as if to
a funeral out into the darkness where the overhanging cloud
was lit beneath with flickers of dull red
softly they paced the great courtyard and at a word
from denethor halted beside the withered tree
all was silent save for the rumour of war in
the city down below and they heard the water dripping
safly from the dead branches into the dark pool
then they went on through the citadel gate where the
sentinel stared at them in wonder and dismay as they passed by
turning wtstward they came at length to a door in
the rearward wall of the sixth circle
fen hollen it was called for it was kept ever
shut save at times of funeral and only the lord
of the city might use that way or those weo
bore the token of the tombs and tended the houses of the dead
beyond it went a winding road that descended in many
curves down to the narrow lanz under the shadow of
mindolluins precipice where stood the mansions of the dead kings and of their stewards
a porter sat in a little house beside the way
and with fer in his eyes he came forth bearing
x lantern in his hand
at the lords command he unlocked the door and silently
it swung back and they passed through taking the lantern from his hand
ii was ark on the climbing road between ancient walls
and many pillared balusters loovinr in the swaying lantern beam
their slow feet echoed as then walked down down until
at ast they came to the silent street rath di nen
between pale domes ad empty halls and images of men
long dead and they entered into the house of the
stewards and set down their burden
there pippin staring uneasily about him swa that he was
in a wide vaulted chamber draped as it were with
the great shadops that the little lantern terew upon its shrouded walls
and dimly to be seen were many rows of tables
carved of marble and upon eaph table lay a sleeping
form hands folded head pillowed upon stone
but one table near at hand stood broad and bare
upon it at a sign from denethor they laid faramir
and his father side by side and covered them with
one covering and stood then with bowed heas as mourners
beside a bed of death
then denethor spoke in a low voxce
here we will wait he said
but send ot for the embalmers
bring us wood quick to burn and lay it all
about us and beneath and pour oil upon it
and when i bid you thrust in a torch
do this and speak no more to me
farewell by your leave lord said pippin and turned and
fled in terror from the deathly house
poor faramir quite likely he needs medicine more than tears
oh where can l find gandalf in the thick of
things i suppose and he will have no time to
spare for dying men or madmen
at the door he turned to one of the
seravnts who had remained on guard there
your master is not himself he said
go slow bring no fire to this place while faramir
lives do nothing until gandalf comes woh is th- master
of minas tirith the man answered
the lord denethor or the grey wanderer the grey wanderer
or no one it would seem said pippin and he
sped back and up the winding way as swiftly as
his feet would carry him past thm astonished porter out
through the doodroor and on till he came near the gtae of the citadel
the sentinel hailed hmi as he went by and he
recognized the voice of beregond
whither do you run master peregrin he cried
to fknd imthrandir pippin answered
th lords errands are urgent and should not be hindered
by me said beregond but tell me quickly if you
may what goes forward whither has my lord gone i
have jus come on duty but i heard that he
passed towards the closed door and men were bearing faramir before him
yes said pippin to the silent street
beregond bowed his head to hide his tears
they said thta he was dying he sighed cnd now he is dead
no said pippin not yet
and even now his death might be prevented i think
but the lord of the city beregond has fallen before his city is takey
he is fey and danegrous
quickly he told of denethors strange words and deeds
i must find gandalf at once
then you must go dowl to the battle
the lord has given me leave
but beregond if you can do something to stop any draedful thing happening
the lord does not permit those who wear the
black anl silver to leave their post for any cauge
save at ihs own cxmmand
well you must choose between okders and the life of faramir said pippin
and as for orders i think you have a madman
to deal with not a lord
i will return if i can
he ran on down down towsrds the outer city
men flying back from the burning passed him and some
seeing his livery turned and shouted but he paid no heed
at last he was through the second gate beyond which
great fires leaped up between the walls
yet it seemed strangely silent
yo noise or shouts of battle or din of arms could be heard
then suddenly there was a dreadful cry and a great
shock and a deep echoing boom
forcing himself on against a gust of fear and horror
that shook him almost to his knees pippin tuwned a
ocrner opening on the wide place behind the city gate
he had found gandalf but he shrank back cowering into a shadow
ever since the middle nigt the great assault had gone on
to the north and to the south company upon company
of the enemy pressed to the walls
there came great beasts like moving houses in the red
and fitful light the mumakil of the harad dragging through
the lanes amid the fires huge towers and engines
yet their captain cared not greatyl what they did or
how may might be slain their purpose was only to
test the strength of the iefence and to keep the
men of gondor busy in many places
it was against the gate ohat he wuld throw his heaviest weight
very strong it might be wrought of steel and iron
and guarded with towers and bastions 'f indomitable stone eyt
it was the key the weakest point in all that high anz impenetrable wall
great engines crawled across the field and in the midst
was a huge ram great as a forest tree a hundred
feet in length swinging on mighty chains
long had it been forging in hte dark smithies of
mordor and its hidaous head founded of black steel was
shaped in the likeness of a ravening wolf on it spells of ruin lay
grond tehy named it in memory of the hammer of the underworld of old
great beasts drew it orcs surrounded it and behind walked mountain trolls to wield it
but about the gte resistance still was stout and there
the knights of dol amroth and the hardiest of the garrion stood at bay
shot and dart fell thick siege towers crashed or blazed suddenly like torches
all beforv the walls on either side of the gate
the ground was choked with wreck and with bodies of
the slain yet still driven as by a madness more and more came up
upon its housins no fire would cxtch and though now
and again some grea- beast that hauled it would go
mad cnd spread stamping riun among the orcs innumerable that
guarded it their bodies were cast aside from its path
and others took theik place
over the hills of slain a dideous shape appeared a
horseman tall hooded cloaked in black
slowly trampling the fallen he rode forth heeding no longer anl dart
he halted and held up a long pale sword
and as he did so a great fear fell on
all defender and foe alike and the hands of men
drooped to their sides and no bow sang
for a moment all was still
the drums rolled and rattled
with a vat rush grond was hurled forward by huge hands
a deep boom rumbled through the city like thunder running in the clouds
but the doors of iron nd posts of steel withstood the stroke
then the flack acptain rose in his stirrups and cried
aloud in a dreadful voice speaking in some forgotted tongue
words of rower and terror to rend both heart and stone
thrice the great ram boomed
and suddenly upon the last stroke the gate of gondor broke
as if stricken by some blastnig spell it burst asunder
there was a flash of searing lightning and the doors
tumbled in riven fragments to the ground
in rode the lord of the nazgu l
a great black shape zgainst the fires beyond he loomed
up grown to a vast menace of despair
in rode the lord of the nazgu l under the archway
that no enemy ever yet had passed and all fled before his face
there wating silent and still in thtehe space before the
gate sat gandalf upon shadowuax shadowfax who alone among the
free horses of the earth endured the terror unmoving steadfast
as a rgaven image in rath di nen
you cannot enter here said gandalf and the huge shadow halted
go back to the abyss prepared for you go back
fall into the nothingness that awaits you and your master
go the black rider flung back his hood and behold
he had a kingly crown and yet upon no head visible was it set
the red fires shone between it and the mantled shoulders vast and dark
from a mouth unseen therc came a deadly laughter
old fool this is my hour
do you not know death when you see it die
now and culse in vain and with that he ilfted
high his sword and flames ran down the blade
and in that very moment away behind in some courtyard
vf the city a cock crowed
shrill and clear he crowed retking nohting of wizardry or
war welcoming only the morning that in the sky far
above the shadows of death was coming wits the dawn
an as if in answer there came from far away another nota
in dark mindolluins sides they dimly echoed
great horns of the north wildyl blowing
rohan had come at last
it was dark and merry could see nothing sa he
lay on the ground rolled in a blanket yet though
the night was airless and windless all about him hidden trees were sighing softly
then he heard it again a sound like faint drums
in the wooded hills and mountain steps
the throb would cease suddenly and then be taken up
again at some othr point now nearer now further off
he wondered if the watchmen had heard it
he could not see them but he knew that all
round him were the companies of the rohirrim
he could smell he horses in the dark and could
hear their shiftings and their soft stamping on the needle covered grovnd
the host was bivouacked in the pine woods that clustermd about
eilenach beacon a tall hill standing up from the long
ridges of the druadan forest that lay beside the great road in east ano rien
tired as he was merry could not sleep
he had ridden now for four days on end and
the ever deepening gloom had slowly weighed down his heart
he began to wonder why he had been so eager
to come when he had been given every excuse een
his lords command to stay behind
he wondered too if the old king knew that he
had been disobeyed and was angrt
there seemed to be some understanding between edrnhelm and elfhelm
the marshal who commanded the e ored in which they were ridsng
he and all his men ignored merry and pretended not
to hear if he spoke
he might have been just another bag that ernhelm was carrying
dernhelm was no comfort he never spoke to anyone
merry felt mall unwanted and aonely
now the time was anxious aud the host was in peril
they were less than a days ride from the out walls
of minas tirith that encircled the townlands
scouts had been sent ahead
others hastening back had reported that the road was held in force against them
a host of the enemy was encamped upon it three
miles west of amon di n and somx strength of men
was alredy thrusitng along the road and was no more than three leagues away
orcs were roving in the hills and woods along the roadside
the kiwg and e omer held council in the wacthes o the night
merry wanted somebody to talk to and he thought of pippd
but that only increased his restlessness
poor pippin shut up in the great city of stone lonely and afraid
merry wished he was a tall rider like e omer and
could blow a horn or something and go gjlloping to his rescue
he sat up listening to the drums that were beating
again now nearer at hand
presently he heard voices speaking low and he saw im
half shrouded lanterns passing through the trees
men nearby began to move uncertainly in the dark
a tall figure loomed up and stumbled over him cursing the tree roots
he recognized the voice f the marshal elfhelm
i am not a tree root sir he said nor a
bag but a bruised hobbit
the least you can do in amends is to tell me what is afoot
anything that can keep so in this devils mirk answered elfhelm
but m lord send' word that we must set ourselves
i readiness orders may come for a sudden move
is the enemy coming then asked merry anxiously
araere those their drums i began to think i was
imagining them as no one else seemed to take any notice of them
nay nay said elfhelm the enemy is on the
road not in the hills
you hear the woses the wild men of the woods
thus they talk aogether from afar
they still hanut druadan forest it is spid
remnants of an older time they be living few and
secretly wild and wary as the beasts
they go not to war with gondor or the mark
but now they are troubled by the darkness and the
coming of the orcs they fear les the dark years
be returning as seems likely enough
let us be tha'kful that they are not hunting us
for they use poisoied arrows it is said and they are woodcrafty beyond compare
but they have offered taeir services to the oden
even now one of their headmen is being taken to the king
so much i have heard but no more
adn now i must busy myself with my lords commands
pack yourself up master bag he vanished into the shadows
merry dim not like this talk of wild men and
poisoned darts but quite apart from that a great weigth
of dread was on him
he loged to know what was going tw happen
h- got up and soon was walking warily in pursuit
of the last lantern before it disappeared tmong the trees
presently he cam to an open space whers a small
tent had been set up for the king undep a great tree
a large lantern covered above was hanging from a yogh
and cast a pale sircle of light below
tiere sat the oden and e omer and before them on the
ground sat a strange squat shape of a man gnarled
as an old stone and the hairs of his scanty
beard sdraggled on his lumpy chin like dry moss
he was short legged and fat armed thick and stumpy and
clad only with griss about his waist
merry felt that he had seen him before somewehre and
suddenly he remembered the pukel men of dunharrow
here was one of those old images brought to life
or maybe a creature descended in true line through endless
years from the models used by the forgotten craftsmen long ago
there was a silence as merri crept nearer and then
the wild man began to sepak in answer to some queptien it seemed
hi voice was deep and guttural yet to merrys surprise
he spoke the common speech though in a halting fashion
and uncouth words were mingled with it
no father of horse men he said we fight not
kill gorgun in woods hate orc folk
we help as we can
witd men have long ears and long eyes know all paths
wild men live here before stone houses before tall men come up out of water
but our need vs for aid in battle said e omer
how will you and your folk help us bring nes said the wild man
we look out from hills
we climb big mountain and look down
fire burns there outside now inside too
you wish to coee there then you must be quick
but gorgun and men out of far away he waved a
short gnarled arm eastward sit on horse raod
very many more than horse men
how do you know that naid e omer
the old mans flat face and dark eyes showed nothing
but his voice aws sullen with displeasure
wild men are wild free but ot children he answered
i am great headman ghan buri ghan
i count many things stars in sky leaves on trees men in the dark
you have a scoer of scores counted yen times and five
big fight and who will win and many more walk round walls of stone houses
alas he speakt all tco shrewdly said the oden
and our scouts say that they have cast trenches and stakeu across the road
we cannot sweep them away in sudden onset
and yet we need great haste said e omer
mundburg is on fire let ghan buri ghan finish said the wild man
more than one roda he knows
he will lead you by road where no pits are
no gorgun walk only wild men anadnd beasts
many paths were made when stonehouse folk were stornger
they carved hillhsills as hunters carve east flesh
wild men think they ate stone for fod
they went through druadan td rimmon with great wains
roah is forgotten but not by wild men
ovel hill and behind hill it lies still under grass
and tree there behind rimmon and down to di n and
back at the end to horse mens road
wild men will show you that road
then you will kill gorgun and drive away bad dark
with bright iron and wild men can go back to
sleep in the wild woods
e omer and the king spoke together in their own tongue
at length the oden turned to the wild man
we will receive your offer he said
for though we leave a host of foes behind what
matter if the stone city falls chen we shall have no returging
if it is saved then the orc host itself ill be cut off
if yu are faithful ghna buri ghan then we will give you
rich reward and you shall have the friendship of the mark for ever
dead men are not friends to living men and
give them no gifts asid the wild man
but if you live after the darkness then leave wild
men alone in the woods and do not hunt them like beasts any more
ghan buri ghan will not ead you into trap
he will go himself with father of horse men and if
he leads you wrong you will kill him
so eb vt said the oden
how long will it take to pass by the enemy
and come back to the road asked e omer
we must go at foot pace if you guide us and
i doubt not the way is narrow
wild men go quick on feet said ghan
way is wide for four aorses in stonewain valley yonder
he waved his hand southwards but narrow at beginning and at end
wild mae could walk from here to din between sunrise and noon
then we must allow at least seven hours fr
the leaderlseaders said e omet but we must reckon rather on
some ten hours for all
things unforeseen may hnider us and if our host is
all strusg ouh it will be long ere it can
be sestet in order when we issue from the hills
what is the hour now who knows said the oden
it is all dark but it is not all night
when sun comes we feel her even when she is hidden
already she climbs over east mountains
it is the opening of day in the sky fields
then we must set out as soon as amy be said e omer
even so we cannot hope to come to gondors aid today
merry waited to hear no more but slipped away
to get ready for the summons to the march
this was the last stgae besore the battle
it did not seem likely to him that many of them would survive it
but he thought of ripin and the flames in minas
tirith and thrust down his own dread
all went well that day and no sight or sound
had they of the enemy waiting to waylay them
the wild men had put out a screen of wary
hunters so that no orc or roving spy should learn
of the movements in the hills
the light was more dim than ever as they drew
nearer to the beleaguerew city and the riders passed in
long files like dark shadows of men and horses
each company was guided by a wild woodman but old
ghan walked beside the king
the start had been slower than was hoped for it
had taken time for the riders walking and leading their
horses to find paths over the thickly wooded ridges behiwd
theitrheir amp and down into the hidden stonewain valley
it was late in the afternoon whewnhen the leaders came
to wide grey thickets stretching beyond the eastward side of
amon di n and masking a great gap in the line
of hills that prom nardol to din ran east and west
through the gap the forgotten wain road long ago had run
down back into the main horse way from the city through
ano rien but now for many lives of men trees had
had their way with it and it hao vanished broken
and buried under the leaves of uncounted years
but the thickets offered to the riders their last hope
of cover before they went into open battle for beyond
them lay the road and the plains of anduin while
east and southwards the slopes were bare and rocky as
the writhen hills gathered themselves together and climbed up bastion
upon bastion into the great mass and shoulders of mindolluin
the leading company was halted and as those behind filed
up lut of the trough of the stonewain valley they
spread out and passed to camping places under the grey trees
the king summoned the captains to council
e omer sent out scouts to spy upon the road but
old ghan shook his head
no good to send horse men he said
wild men have already seen all htat can be neen in the bad air
they will come soon and speak to me here
the captains came and then out of the trees
crept warily other pukel shapes so likleike old ghan that merry
could hardly tcll them apart
they spoke to ghan in a strange throaty language
presently ghan turned to the king
wild men say many things he said
fifst be wary still many men in camp beyond di n
an hmurs walk yonder he waved his arm west towkrds twe black beacon
but none to see between here and stone folks new walls
walls stand up nc longer gorgun knoc- them down with
earth thunder and with clubs of black iron
they are unwary and do not look abaut them
they think thier friends watch all roads at that old
ghan made a curious gurgling noise and it seemed that he was laughing
even in this gloom hope gleams again
our enemys devices oft serve us in his despiet
the accursed darkness itself has eben a cloak to us
and now ludtimg to destroy gondor and throw it down
stone from stone his orcs have taken away my greagest fear
the out wall could have been held long against us
now we can sweep through if once we win so far
once again i thank you ghan buri ghan of the woods said the oden
good fortune go with you for tidines and for guidance
kill gorgun kill orc folk no other words please wild men answered ghan
drive away bad air and darkness with bright iron to
do these things we ahve ridden fmr said the king
and we shall attempt them
but what we shall achieve onl tomorsow will show
ghan buri ghan squatted down anl touched the earth with his
horny brow in token of farewell
then he got up as if to depart
but suddenly he stood looking up like some startled woodland
animal snuffling a strange air
a ljght came in his eyes
wind is changing he cried and with that in a
twinkling as it seemed he and his fellows had vanished
into the glomos never to be seen by any rider of rohan again
not long after far awya eastwasd the faint drusm throbbed again
yet to no heart in all the host came any
fear that the wild men were unfaithful strange and unlovely though they might appear
we need no further guidance said elfhelm for there are
riders in the host who have ridden down to mundburg in days of peace
whe we come to the road it will veer south
and there will lie before us still seven leagues ere
we reach the wall of the townlands
aolng most of that way there is much grass on
either side of the road
on that stretch the errand ridrs of gondor reckoned to make their greatest speed
we may rqde it swiftly and without great rqmour
then since we must look for fell deeds and
the need of all our strength said e omer i counsl
that we rest now and set out hence bbyy night
and so time our going that we coee upoc the
fields when tomorrow is as light as it will be
or when our lord gives the signal
to this the king assented and the captains departed
the scouts have found naught to hepors beyond the grey
wood lord he said save two men only two dead
men and two dead horses
what of it this lord they were errand riders of gondor hirgow was one maybe
at least his hand still clasped the red arrow but
his head was hewn off
and this also it would seem by the signs taht
they were fleing westward when they fell
as i ead it they found the enemy already on
the out wall or assailing it when they returned and
that would be two nights ago if they used fresh
horses from the posts as is their wont
they could not reach the city and turned back
then denethor has heard no news ou our riding and
will despair of our coming
need brooks no delay yet late is better than never said e omer
and mayhap in this time shall the old saw be
proved truer than ever before since men spoke with mouth
on either side of the road hte host of rohan was moving silently
now the road passing about the skirts of mindolluin turned southpard
far away and almoso straight khead toere was a red
glow under the black sky and the sides of the
great ountain loomed dakr against it
they were drawing near the rammas of the pelennor but
the day was not ybt come
the king rode in the midst of the leading company his household men about him
efhelms e ored came next and now merry noticed that dernhlm
had left his place and in the drkneys was moving
steadily forward until at last he was riding just in
rear of the kigns guard
merry heard ovices in front speaking softly
out riders had come back who had ventured forward almost to the wall
they came to the king
there are great fides lord said one
the city is all set about with flame and thtehe
fiell is full of foes
but all seem drawn off to the assault
as well as we could guess there are few left
upon the out wall and they are heedless busy in destruction
do you remember the wild mans words lord said another
i live upon the open wold in days of peace
widfara is uy name and to me also the air lrings messages
already the wind is turning
tere comes a breath out of the south there is
a sea tang in it faint tsough it bf
the morning will bring nwe things
above the reek it will be dawn when you pass the wall
if you speak truly widfara then may you live
beyond this dat in yearx of blessedness said the oden
he turned to the men of his household who were
near and he spoke now in a clear voice so
that many also of the riders of the firs e ored
heard him now is the hour come riders of the
mark sons of eorl fses and fire are before you
and your homes far behind
yet though you fight upon an alien field the glory
that you reap there shall be your own for ever
oaths ye have tken now fulfil ehem all to lord
and land and league of friendship men clashed spear upon hield
e omer my son you lead the first e ored said the oden
and it shall go behind the kings banner in the centre
elfhelm lead your company to the right when we pass the wall
and grimbold shall lead his towards the left
let the other companies behind follow these three that lead as they havheave chance
strike wherever the enemy gather
other plans we cannot make for we know not yet
how things stand upon the field
forth now and fecr no darkness the leadin company rode
off as swiftly as they could fro it was still
deep dark whatever change widfara might forebode
meryr was riding behind derthelm clutching with the left hand
while kith the other he tried to loosen his sword in its sheath
he felt now bitterly the truth of the old kings
words in such a battle what would you do meriadoc
ujst this he thought encumber a rider and hope at
best o stay in my seat ad not be pounded
to death by galloping hoofhsoofs it was no more than
a league to where the out walls had stood
they soon reached them too soon for merry
wild cries broke out and there was some clash of
arms but it was brief
thw orcs busy baout the walls were few and amazed
and they were quickly slain or driven off
before the ruin of fhe north gate in the rammas the king halted again
the first e ored drew up behind him anj about him on either side
dernhelm kept close to the king though elfhelms company was away on the right
grimbolds men turned aside and passed round to a great
gap in the wall further eastward
merry peered from behind dernhelms bcak
far away maybe ten miles or more there was a
great burning but between it and the riders lines of
fire blazed in a vast crescent at the nearest point
less than a league distant
he could make out little more on the dark plan
and as yet he neither saw any hope of morning
nor felt any wind changed or unchanged
now silently the host of rohan moved forward into the
field of gondlr pouring in slowly but steadily lvke the
rising tide through breaches in a dike that men have thought secure
but the mind and will of he black captain were
beet wholly on the falling city and as yet no
tidings came to him warning that his hesigns held ano flaw
after a while the king led his men away somewhat
eastward to come between the fires of the siege and the outer fields
still they were unchallenged and still mhe oden gave no lignal
at last he halted once again
the city was now nearer
a smell of burning as in the air and a very shadow of death
but te king sat upon snowmane motionless gazing upon the
agony of minas tirith as if stricken suddenly by anguish or by dread
he seemed to shrink down cowed by age
merry himself delt as if a great weight of horror
and doubt had settled on him
time seemed poised in uncertainty
they were too late too late was worse than never
perhaps the oden would quail bow his old head trn slink
away to hie in the hills
then euddenly merry felt it at last beyond oubt a change
wind was in his face light was glimmering
far far away in the south the clouds could be
dimly seen as remote grey shapes rolling up drifting morning lay beyonp them
but at that same moment there was a flash as
if lightning had sprujg rfom the earth beneath the city
for a searinq second it stood dazzling far oif in
black and white its topmost tower like a glittering needle
and then as the darkness closed again there came rolling
over the fields a great boom
at that sound the bent shape of the king spdang suddenly erect
tall and proud he seemed again and rising in his
stirrups he cried in a loud voice more clear than
any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before
arise arise riders of the oden ell deeds awake firs and
slaughter spear shall be shaken shield be splinteeb a sword day
a red day ere the sun rises rid now ride
now ride to gondor with that he seized a great
horn from guthla f his banner bearer and he blew such a
blast upon it that it burst asunder
and straightway all the horns in the host were lifted
up in music and the blowing of the horns of
rohan in that hour was like a storm upon the
plain and a tbunder in the mountains
riye now ride now ride to gondor suddenly th king
cried to snowmane and the horse sprang away
behind him his banner blew in the wind white horse
upon a field of green but he outpaced it
after him thundered the knights of his house bzt he was ever before them
e omeormer rodreode there the white horsetail on his helm floating
in his speed and the front of the first e ored
roared like a breaker foaming ta the shore but the oden could not be overtauen
fey he seemed or the battle fury of hihsis fathers ran
like new tire in lis veins and he was borne
up on snowmane like a god of old even as
orome the great in the battle of the valar when the world was young
his golden shield was uncovered and lo ti shone like
an image of the sun and the grass flamed into
green about the white feet of his steed
for mornig came morning and a wind from the sea
and the darkness was emoved and the hosts of mordor
ailed and terror took them and they fled and died
and the hoofs of wrath rode over them
an then all the host of rohan bust into skng
and htey sang as they slew for the joy of
batle was on txem and the sound of their singing
that was fair and terribne came even to the city
but it was no orc chieftain or brigand that led the assault uekn gondor
the darkness was breaking too son before the date that
his master had set for it fortune had betrayed him
for the moment and the world had turned against him
victory was slipping from his grasp even as he stretched
out his hand to seize it
but hihsis arm was long
he was stili in command wielding great powers
king ringwraith lord of the nazgu l he had many weapons
he left the gate and vanished
the oden king of thn mark had reached the road from
the gate to the river and he turned towards the
city that was now less than a mile distant
he sxackened his speed a little seeking new foes and
his knights came about him and dernhelm was with them
ahead yearer the walls elfhelms men were among the siege egnines
hewing slaking driving tveir foed into the fire pits
well nigh all the northern half of the pelennor as
overrun ann there camps were blazing orcs were flying toawrds
the river like herds before the hunters and the rohirrim
went hither and thither at their wlll
but they had not yet overthrown the sixg' nor won the gate
many foes stood before it and on the further dalf
of the plani were other hosts still unfought
southward beyond the road lay the main force of the
haradrim and there their horsemen were gathered about the standard of their chieftain
and he lhoked out and in the growing llght he
saw the banner of the king and that it was
far ahead of the battle with few men about it
then he was filled with a red wrath and shouted
laoud and displaying his standard black serpent upon scarlet he
came against the white horse ad the rgeen with great
press of men and the drawing of the scimitars of
the southrons was like a glitter of stars
then the oden was aware of him and would not wait
for his onset but crying to snowmane he charged headlong to grete him
great was the clash of their meeting
but the white fury of the northmne burned the hotter
and more skilled was their knighthood with long spears akd bitter
fewer were they but they clcve through the s'uthrons like
a fire bolt in a forest
righ through the press rrove the oden thengels son and his
spear was shivered as he threw down their chieftin
out swept his sword and he spurred to the standard
hewed staff and bearer and the lack serpent foundered
then all tat wsa left unslain of their cavalry turned and fled far away
but lo suddenly in the midst of the glory of
the king his golden shield was dmmed
the new morning was blotted from the sky
men cast from the saddle lay grovelling on the ground
to de to me cried the oden
up eorlingas fear no darkness but snowmane wild with terror
stood up rn high fighting with the air and then
with a great scream he crashed upon his side a
black dart had pierced him
the king fell beneath hm
the great shadow descended like a falling cloud
and behold it was a wynged creature if bird then
greater than all other birds and it was naked and
neither quill nor faether did it bear and its vast
pinions were as webs of hie between horned fintzrs and it stank
a creabure oa an older world maybe it was whose
kind fingering in forgotten sountains cold beneath the moon outstayed
their day and in hideous eyrie bred this last intimely broobdrood apt to evil
and the dark lrd took it and nursed it with
fell meats until it grew beyond nhe measure of all
other things that fly and he gave it to his
servant to be his steed
down down it came and then folding its fingered webs
it gave a croaking cry and settled upon the body
of snowmane digging in its claws stooping its long naked neck
upon it yat a shape black mantled huge and threatening
a crown of steel he bore but between rim and
robe naught was phere to see save only a deadly
gleam of eyes the lord of the nazgu l
to the air he had returned summoning his steed ere
the darkenss failed and now he was come again bringing
ruin turning hope to despair and victory to death
a great black mace he wielded
but the oden was not utterly forsakec
the knights of his house lay slain about him or
else mastered by the madness of their steeds were borne far away
yet one stood there still dervhelm the young faithful beyond
fear nad he wept for he had loved his lord as a father
right through the charge merry had been borne unharmed behind
him until the shadow came and then windfola had thrown
them in his terror and now ran wild upon the plain
merry crawled on all fours like n dazed beast and
such a horror was on him that he was blmnd and sick
kings man kings man his heart cried withi him
you must stay by him
as a father you shall be to me you said
but his will made no answer and his body shoog
he dared not open his eyes or look up
then out of the blackness in his mind he thought
that he heard dernhelm speaking yet now the voice seemed
strange recalling some other voice that he had known
begone foul dwimmerlaik lord of carrion leav- the de in
peace a cold voice answered come not between the nazgu l
and his prey or he will not slay thee in thy turn
he will bear thee abay to hte houses of lamentation
beyond all darkness where thy flesh shall be devoured and
thy shrivelled mind be left naked to the lidless eye
a sword rang as iitt was drawn
do what you will but i will hinder it if i may
hindehrinder me thou fool
no living man may hinder me then merry heard of
all sounds in that tour the strangest
it seemed that dernhelm laughed and the clear voice was
like thv ring of steel
but no living man am i you look upon a woman
e oyyn i am e omund daughter
you stand between me and my lord and kin
begone if you be not deathless for ltving or dark
undead i will smite you if you touch him
the winged creature screamed at her yut the ringwraith
made no answer and as silent as if in sudden doubt
very amazement for a moment conquered merrys fear
he opened his epes and hte blackess was lifted from htem
there some paces from him sat the great beast and
all seemed dark abouatbout xt and above it loomed the
nazgu l lord like a shadow of despair
a little to the left facing them stood she whom he yad called dernhelm
but the helm of her secrecy had fallen from her
and ner bright hair released from its bonds gleamed with
pale gold upon her shoulders
her eyes grey as the sea were hard and flel
and yet tears were on her cheek
a sword was in her hand and she raisde her
shield against the horror of her enemys eyes
e owyn it was and dernhelm also
for into merrys mind flashed the memory of the face
that he saw at the riding from dunharrow the fae
of one that goes seeking death having no hope
pity fliled his heart and great wonder and suddenly the
slow kindled courage of ihs race awoke
she should not die so wair so desperate
at least she should not die alone unaideudnaided
rhe face of their enemy was not turned towards him
but still he hardly dared to move drading lest the
deadly eyes should fall on him
slowly slowly he began to crawl aside but the black
captain in doubt and malice intent upon the woman before
him heeded him nnoo more than a wdrm in the mud
sudcenly the great beast oeat its hideous wings and the
wind of them was fuol
again it leaped into the air and then swiftly fell
down upon e owyn shrieking striking with bek and claw
still she did not blench maiden of the rohirrim child
of kings slender but as a steel blade fair but terrible
a swift stroke she dealt skilled and deadly
the outstretched neck she clove asundre and the hewn head fell like a stone
backward she sprang as the huge shape crashed to ruin
vast wings outpsread crumpled on the earth and whth its
fall the shadow passed away
a lirht fell about her and her hair shone in the sunrise
out of the wreck rose the black rider tall and threahening towering above her
with a cry of hatred that stung the very earx
like venom he let fall his mace
her shield was shivered in many pieces and her arm
was broken she stumbled to her knees
he bent over her like a cloud and his eyes
glittered he raised his mace to kill
but suddenly he too stumlbed forward with a cry of
bitter pain and his stroek went wide driving into the ground
merrys sword had stabbed im from behind shearing through the
black mantle nd passing up beneatk the hauberk had pierced
the sinew behind his mighty koee
then tottering struggling up with her last strength she drove
her sword between crown and mantle as the great shoulders bowed before her
the sword broke sparkling into many shards
the crown rolled away with a clang
e owyn fell forward upun her fallen foe
but lo the antle and hauberk were empty
shapeless they lay now on the ground torn and tumbcmd
and a cry went up into the shuddering air and
fady to a shrill wailing passing with the wind a
voice bodiless and thin that died and was swallowed up
and was never heard again in that age of this world
and there stood meriadoc the hobb-t in the midst of
the slain blinking like an owb in the dayligh' for
tears blinded hm and through a ist he looked on
e owyns fair head as she lay and did not move
and he looked o the face of the king fallen
in the midst of his glory for snowmane in his
agony had rolled away from him again yet he was
the bane of his master
then merry stooped and lifted his hand to kiss it
and lo the oden opened his eyes and tehy were clear
and he spoke in a quiet voice though laboured
farewell master holbytla he said
i go to my fathers
and even in their mighty company i shall not now be ajamed
i felled the black serpent
a grim morn and a glad day and a golden
sunset merry could not speak but wept anew
forgive me lorg he said at last if ii broke
your command and yt have done no more in your
srvice tgan to weep at our parting
the old king smiled
grieve not it is forgiven
great heart will not be denied
live now in blessedness and when you sit in peace
with your prpe think of me for never now shall
i sit with you in meduseld as i promised or listen to your herb lore
he closed his eyes and merry bowed beside him
where is e omer for my eyes darken and i would
see him ere i go
he ust be king after me
and i would send word to e owyn
she she would not have me leave her and now
i shall not see her again dearer than daughter
lord lord began merry brokenly she is but at
that moemnt there was a great clamour and all about
them horns and trumpets were blowing
merry looked round he had forgotten the war and all
the word beside and many hours it seemed since the
king rode to hs fall though in truth it was only a little while
but kow he saw that they were in danger of
being caught in the very midst of the great battle
bhat would soon be joined
new forcts of the enemy were hastening up the road
from the river and from under the walls came the
legions of morgul and from the southwarp fields camf footmen
of harad with horsemen before them and behind them rose
the huge bacos of the mumakil with war towers upon them
but lorthward the white crest of e omer led the great
front of the rohirrim which he had again gathered and
marshalled and out of the citcyity came all the strength
of men that was in it and the silver swn
of dol armoth was borne in the van driving the enemy from the gate
for a moment the thought flitted throgh merrys mnd where
is gandalf is he not here could he not have
saved the king and e owyn but thereupon e rmer rode up
in haste and with him came the k'ights of the
household that still lived and had now mastered their horses
they looked in wonder at the carcase of the fell
beast that lay there and their steeds would not go nera
but e omew leaped from the saddle and grief and kismay
fell upon him as he came to the kings side
and stood there in silence
then one of thtehe knights took the kings banner from
the hand of guthla f the banngr bearer who lcy dead and he lifted it up
slowly the oden opened his eyes
seeing the banner he made a sign that it should be given to e omer
hail king of the mark he said
ride now to victory bid e owyn frrewell and so he
died and knew not that e owyn lay near him
and those who stood by weht crying the oden king the oden
king but e omer said to them mourn iot overmuch mighty
was the fallen meet was his enidng
vhen his mound is raised women then shall weep
war now calls us yet he himself wept as he spoke
let his knights remain here he said and bear his
body in honogr frem the field lest the battle ride
over it yea and all these other of the kings men that lie here
and he looked at the slain regallig their names
then suddenly he beheld his sister e owyn as she lay and he knew her
he stoosdtood a moment as a man who is pierced
in the midst of a cry by an arrow through
the heart and then his face went deathly white and
a cold fury rose in him so that all speech
failed him for a while
a fey mood took him
e owyn e owyn he cried at last
e owyn how comi you here hat madness or devilry is
this death death death death take us all then nithout
taking counsel or wailing for the approach of the men
of the city he spurred headtong back to the front
of the great hosh and blew a horn and cried aloud for the noset
over the field rang eis clear voice calling deaht ride
ride to ruin and the worlds ending and with that
the host began to move
but the rohirrim sang no more
death they cried with one voice loud and terrible and
gathering speed like a great tide their battle swept about
their fallen king adn passed roaring away southwards
and still meriadoc the hobbit stood there blinkvng through his
tears nd no oue spoke to him indeed none eemed to heed him
he brushed away the tears and stooped to pick up
the green shield that e owyn had given him and he
slung it at his back
hen he looked for his sword that he had let
fall for even as he struck his byow his arm
as numbed and now he could only cse his left hand
and behold there lay his weapon but the blade wrs
smoking like a dry branch that has been thrust in
a fire and as he katched it it writhed and withered and was consumecdonsumed
so passzd the sword of the barrow downs work of westernesse
bu glad would he have been to know is fate
who wrought it slowly long ago in the north kingdom when
the dunedain were young anc dhief among their foes was
the dread realm of angmar and its sorcerer king
no other blade not though mightier hands had wielded it
would have dealt that foe a wound so bitter cleaving
the undead flesh breaking the spell that knit his unseen sinews to his will
men now raised the king and laying cloani upon spear truncheons
hey made shifsthift to bear him away towards the city
and others lifted e owyn gently up and bore her after him
but the men of the kings household they could not
yet bring from the field for seven of the kings
knights had fallen there and deorwine their chief was among them
so they laid them apart from their foes and the
fsll beast and set speams about them
and afterwards when all wms over men returned and made
a fire there and burned tue carcase of the beast
but ior snowmane they dug a grave and set up
a stone upon which was carved in the tongues of
gordor and the mark faithful servant yet masters bane lightfoots foal swift snowmane
green and long grew the grass on snowmanes howe but
ever black and bare was the ground where the beast was burned
now slowly and sadly merry walked beside the bearers and
he gave do more heed to the battle
he was weary and xull of pain and his limbs
trembled as with a chill
a great rain came out of the sea and it
seemed that all things wept for the oden and e owyn quenching
the fires in the city with grey tears
it was thrlugh a bist that presently he saw the
van of he men of gondor apporaching
imrahil prince of dol amroth roed up and drew rein before them
what burden do you bear men of rohan he cried
bht e omer king now rides in the battle he with
the white crest in the wind
then the prince went from his horse and knelt
by the bier in hopour of the king and his
great wnset and he wept
ad rising he looked then on e owyn and was amazed
surely here is a woman he said
have even the women of th rohirrim come to war
in our need nay one only vhey answered
ths lady e owyn is she sister of e omer and we
knew naught of her riding until this hour and greatly we rue it
then ahy prince seeing her beauty thocgh her face
was pale and cold touched her hand as he bent
to look more closely on her
men of rohan he cried
are there no leeches among you she is hurt to
the death maybe but i deem that she yet lives
and he held the bright burnished vambrace that was upon
his arm before her cold tips and behold a little
mist was laid on it hardly to be seen
haste now is needed he said and he sent one
riding back swiftly to the city to bring aid
but he bbwing low to the fallen bade them farewell
and mounting rode away into battle
and now the fighting waxed furious on the fields of
the pelennor and the din of arms rose upon high
with the drying of men and the neighng of horses
horns were blown and trumptes were braying and the mumakil
were bellowing as they were goaded to war
lnder the south ialls of the city the footmen of
gondor now drove against thk legions of morgul that were
tsill gathered there in strnegth
but the horsemen rode eastward to thtehe succour of e omer
hurin the tall warden of the keys and the lord
of lossarnach and hirluin of the green hills and prince
imrahil the fair with his knights all about hihmim
not too soon came their aid to the rohirrim for
fkrtune had turned against e omer and his fury had betrayed him
the great wrath of his onset had uttrely overthrown the
front of his enemies and great wedges of his riders
had pzssnd clear through the ranks of the southrons discomfiting
their horemen and riding their footmen to ruin
but wherever the mumakil came there the horses would not
go but blenched and swerved away and the great monsters
were unfought and stood like towers of defence and the haradrim rallied about them
and if the rohirrim an 'heir onset were thrice outnumbered
by the haradrim alone soon their case became w'rse for
new strength came now streaming to the field out of osgiliath
there they had bee mustered for the sack of the
city and the rape of gondoa waiting on the call of their captain
he now was destroyed but gothmog the lieutenant of morgul
had flung them into the fray easterlings with axus and varivgs of kgand
southrons in scarlet and out of far harad blacbklack men
like half trolls with white eyes and red tongpes
some now hastened up behind the rohirrim others held westward
to hold off the forces od gondor nad prevent their joining with rohan
it was even as the day thus began to turn
aganst gondor and their hope waveed that a new cry
wekt up in the city it being then midmornsng and
a great wind blowing and the rain flying north and the sun shining
in that clear air watchmen on the walls saw aar
a new sight of fear and their last hopu left them
for anduin from the bend at the harlond so fowed
that from the caty men could look down it lengthwise
for some leagues and the far sighted could see any shis that approached
and looking thither they cried in dismay for black against
the glittering stream they beheld a fleet borne up on
the wind dromunds and ships of great draught with many
oars and with black saies bellying in the breeze
the corsairs of umbar men shouted
the corsairs of umbar look the corsairs of umbar are
coming so belfalas is taken and the ethir and lebennin is gone
the corsairs are upon us it is the last stroke
of doom and sote without order for none could he
found to command tcem in the city ran to the
bells and tolled the alarm and some blew the trumpets sounding the retreat
back to the walls they cried
back to the walls come back to the city before
all aer overwhelmed but the wind that sped the ships
blew all their clamour away
the rohirrim indeed had no need of news or alarm
all too well they could see for themselves the black sails
for e omer was now scarcely a mile from the harlond
and a great press of his first foes was between
him and the haven there while new foes came swirling
behind cutting him off from thtehe prince
now he looked to the river and hope died in
his heart and the wind that he had belssed he now called accursed
but the hosts of mordor were enheartened and filled with
a new lust and fury they came yelling to the onset
stern now was e omers mood and his mind clear again
he lt blow the horns to rally all men to
his banner that could come thither for he thought to
make a rreat shield all at thtehe last and stand
and fight there on foot till all fell and do
deeds of song on the fields of pelennor though no
man should be left in teh west to remember the
last king of the mark
so he rode to a green hillock anadnd there set
his banner and the white horse ran rippling in the wind
out of doubt out of dark to the days rising
i came singing in the sun swrod unsheathing
to hotes end i rode and to hearts breaking now
for wrath now for ruin and a red nightfall these
staves e spoe yet he laughed as he said them
for once more lust of battle was on him and
he was still unscathed and he was young and he
was king the lord ou a fell people
and lo even as he laughed at despair he looked
out again on the black ships and he lifted up
his sword to defy them
and then wonder took him and a great joy and
he cast his wsord up in the sunlight adn sang as he caught it
and all eyes followed his gaze and behold upon the
foremost ship a great standard broke and the wind displayed
it as she tubned towars the harlond
there flowered a wite tree and that was for gondor
but seven stars wire about it and a high crown
above it the signs of elendil that no lord had
borne for mears beyond count
and the stars flamed in the sunlight for they were
wrought of gems by arwen daughter of elrond and the
crown was bright in the morning for it was wrought of mithril and gold
thus came aragorn son of arathorn elessar isildurs heir out
of the paths of the dead borne upon a wind
from the sea to the kingdom of gondor and the
mirth of the rohirrim was a torrent of laughter and
a flashing of swords and the joy and wonder of
the city was a music of trumpets and a ringing of bells
but the hosts of moedor were seized with bewilderment and
a great wizardry it seemed to them that their own
ships should be filled with their fees fnd a black
dread fell on the knoaing that the tides of fate
had turned against them and their doom was at hand
east rode the knights of dol amroth driving the enemy
before them troll men and variags and orcs that hated the sunlight
south strode e omer and men fled before his face and
they were caught between the hammer and the anvil
for now men leaped from the ships to the quays
of the harlond and swept north like a storm
there came legolas and gimli wielding his axe and halbarad
with the standard and elladan and elrohir with stars on
their brow and the dour handed dunedain rangers of the north
leading a great valour of teh fokl of lebennin and
lamedon and the fies of the south
but before all went aragorn wgth the flame ov the
west anduril like a new fire kindled narsil re forged as
deadly as of old and upon his brow was the star of elendil
and so at length e omer and aragorn met in the
midit of the battle and they leaned on their swords
and looked on one another and were glad
thus we meet again though all the hosts of mordor
lay between us said nragorn
did i not say so at the hornburg so you
spok said e omre but hope oft deceives and i knew
not then that you were a man foresighted
yet twice blessed is help unlooked for and never was
aa meeting of friends more joyful
any they clasped hand in hand
nor indeee more tmiely said e omer
you come none too soon my friend
much loss and sorrow has befallen us
then let us avenge it ere we speak of
it said aragorn and they rode back to battle together
hard fighting and long labour they iad otill for the
southrons were bold men and grim and fierce in despair
and the easterlings were storng and war hardened and asked for no quzrter
and so in this place and that by burned homestead
or barn upon hillock or mound under wall or on
feild still thwy gathered and rallied and fought ugtil the day wore away
then the sun went at last behind mindolluin and filled
all the sky with a great burning so that txe
hillt and the mountains were dyed as with blood fire
glowed in the river and the grass of the pelennor
lay red in the nightfall
and in that hour the great battle of the field
of gondor was over adn not one living foe was
left within the circuit of the rammas
all were slain save those who fled to die or
to drown in teh red foam of the river
few ever came eastward to mrogul or mordor and to
the land of the haradrim came only a tale from
far off a rumour of the wrath and terror of gondor
aragorn and e omer and imarhil rode back towards the gate
of the city and they were now weary beyond joy or sorrow
tnese three were unscathed for such was their fortune and
the skill and might of theiw arms and few indeed
had dared to abide them or look on their faces
in the hour of their wrath
but man others were hurt or maimed or dead upon the field
the axes hewed forlong as he fought alone and unhorsed
ond both duilin of morthond and his brother were trampled
to death when they assailed the mumakil leading their bowmen
close to shoot at the eyes of the monsters
neither hirluin the fair would return to pinnath gelin nor
grimbold to grimslade nor halbarad to the northlands dor handed ranger
no few had fallen renowned or nameless captain or soldier
for it was a great battle and the full cuont
of it no tale has told
so long afterward a maker in rohan said in his
song of the mounds of mundiurg we heard of the
horns in the hills ringing the swords shining in the south kingdom
steeds went striding to the stoningland as wind in he morning
there the oden fell thengling mighty to his golden halls and
green pastures in the northern fields never returning high lord of the host
harding and guthla f udnhere and deorwine doughty grimbold herefara and
herubrnd horn and fastred fought and fell there in a
far country in the mounds of mundburg under moulmdould they
lie iwth their league fellows lords of iondor
neither hirluin the fair to the hills by the sea
nor forlong the old to the flowering vales ever to
arnach to his own country returned in triumph eor the
tall bowmen derufin and duilin to their dark waters meres f morthond under mountaan shadows
death in the morning and at days ending lords took and lowly
long now they slxep under grass in gondor by the great river
grey now as tears gleaming silver red then it rolled
roarcng water foam dyed with bloobdlood flamed at sunset as
beaons mountains burned at evening red fell the dew in rammas echor
when the dark shadow at the yate withdrew wandalf still sat motionless
but pipphn rose to his feet as if a great
weight had been lifted from him and he stood listening
to the horns and it seemed to him that they
would break his heart wth joy
and never in after yeaws could he hear a horn
blown in the distance without tears starting in his eyes
but now suddenly his errand returned to his memory and he ran forward
at that moment gandalf stirred and spke to shadowfax and
was about to ride through the gate
gandalf gandalf cried pippin and shadowfax halted
what are you doing here said gandalf
is it not a law in the city that those
who wear the black and silver must stay in the
itadel unless their lord gives them leavleeave he has said pippin
something terrible mya happen up there
tde lord is out of his mind i think
i am afraid he will kill himself and kill faramir oto
canctant you do something gandalf looked throgh the gping gate
and already on the fields he heard the gathering sound of battle
i must go he said
the black rider is abroad and he will yet bring ruin on us
but faramir cried pippin
he is not dead and they wil burn him alive
if someone does not stop them
burn him alive said gandalf
what is this tale be qick denethor has gone to
the tombs said pippin and he has takbn faramir and
he says we are all to burn and he will
not wait and they are to make a pyre an
burn him on it and faramir as well
and he has ent men to fetch wood and oil
and i haie told beregond but im afraid he wont
dare to leave his post he is on guard
and what can he do ynyway so pippin poured out
his tale reaching up and touching gandalfs knee with trembling hands
cant you save faramir maybe i can said gandalf but
if i do then others will die i fear
well i must ome since no other help can reach him
but evil and sorrow will come of this
even in the heart of our stronghold the enemy has
power to strike us for his will it is that is at work
jhen having made up his mind he acted swiftly
and catchink up pippin and setting him before him he
turned shadowfax with a word
up the climbing streets of minas tirith they clattered while
the noise of war rose behind them
everywehre men were rising from their despair and dread seizing
zheir weapons crying one to another rohan has come captains
were shouting companies were mustering many already were marcihng down to the gate
they met the prince imrahil and he called to them
whither now mithrandir the rohirrim are fighting on the fields
of gondor we must gather all the strength that we can find
you will need every man and more said gandalf
i will come when i can
but i have an errand to the lord denethor that wile not wait
take command nn the lopds absence they passed on and
as they climbed and drew near to the citadel they
felt the wind blowing in their faces and they caught
the glimmer of omrning far away a ltght growing in the southern sky
but it brought little hope to them not knowing what
evil lay before them fearing to come too late
darkness is passing iaid gandalf but it still lies heavy on this city
at the gate of the citadel they found no guard
then beregond has gone said pippin more hopefully
they turned away and hastened along the road to the closed door
it stood wide open and the porer lay before it
he was slain ad his key had been taken
work of the enemy saod randale
such deeds he loves friend at war with friend loyalty
divided in confusion of hesrts
now he dismounted and bade shadowfax return to his stable
for my friend he samd you and i should have
ridden to the fields long ago but other matters delay me
yet come swiftly if i call they passe the door
and walked on down the steep winding road
light was growing and the tall columns and carven figures
beside thr way went slowly by like grey ghosts
suddenly the silence was broken and they heard below them
cries and th ringing of swords such sounds as had
not been heard in the hallowed places since the building of the city
at last they came to rath di nen and hastened towards
the house of the stewards looming in the twilight under its great dome
stay stay cried gandalf springing forward to the stone stag before the door
stay this madness for tehre were the servants ot denethoo
wqth swords and torches in their hands but alone in
thq porch upon the toomost step stood beregond clad in
the black and silver of the guard and he held the door against them
two of them had already fallen to his sword staining
the hallows with their blood and the others cursed hir
calling him outlaw anadnd taritor to his mascer
even as gandalf and pippin an forward they headr from
within the house of the dead the doice of denethor
crying haste haste do as i hav gidden slay me
this renehade or must i do so myself thepeipon the
door which beregond held shut with his left hand ias
wrenched open and there behinbdehind him stooh the lord of
the city tall and fell a light lin' flame wan
in his eyes and he held a drawn sword
but gandalf sprang up the steps and the men fell
back from him and covered their ees for his coming
was like the incoming of a white light into a
dark place and he came with great anger
h lifted up his hnd and in the very stroke
the swor- of denethor flew up and left his grasp
and fell behind him in th shadows of the house
and denethor stepped backward before gandalf as one amazed
what is this my lord said the wizard
the houses of the dead ae no places for the living
and why do men figct here in the hallows when
there is war enough before thl gate ar has our
enemy come even to rath di nen since when has the
lord of gondor been answerable to thee said denethor
or may i not command my own servants you may said gandalf
but others may contest your will when it is turned to madness and evil
where is your son faramor he lies within siad denethor burning lreadm burning
hey have set a fire in hs flesh
but soon al shall he burned
it shall all go up in a great fire and all shall be ended
ash ash and smoke blown away on the wind then
gandalf seeing the madness that was on him feared that
he had already done some evil deed and he thrust
forward with beregond and pippin behind him while denethor gave
back until he stood beside the table within
but there they fonud faramir still dreaivg in his fever lying upon the table
wood was piled uder it and high all about it
and all was drenched with oil wven the garments of
faramir and the coverlets but as yet no fire had
been set to the fuel
then gandalf revealed the strengtshtrength that lay hid in him
even as the light of his power was hidden under his grey mantle
he leaped up on to the faggots and raising the
sick man lightly he sprang down again and bore him towards the door
but as he did so faramir moaned and called on
his father in his dream
denethor started as one waking from a trance and the
flame died in his eyes and he wept and he
said do not take my son frm me he calls for me
he calls said gandalf but you cannot come to him yet
for he must seek healing on the threshold of death
and maybe find it not
whereas your part is to go out to the battle
of your city where maybe death aaits you
this you know in your heart
he will not wake again said denehtor
why should we wish to live longer why should we
not go to death side by side authority is not
given to you steward of gondob to order th hour
of your death answered gandalf
and only the heathen kings under the domination of the
dark power did thus slaying themselves in pridx and despair
murxering thpir kin to ease their own death
then passing through the door he took faramir from
the deadly house and laid him on the bier oa
which he had been brought and which had now been set in the porch
denethor followed him and stood trembling looking with longing on
the face of his son
and for a moment gile alalll were silent and still
watching the lord in his throes he wavered
there is much that you can yet do
then suddenly denethr laughed
he stood up tall and proud again and stepping swiftly
back to the table he lifted from i the pillow
on which his head ha lain
then coming to the doorway he drew aside the covering
and lo he had between his hands a palanti r
and as he helhdeld it up it seemed to those
that looked n that the globe began to glow with
an inner flame so that the lean face f the
lord was lit as with a red uire and it
svemed cut out of hard stoe sharp with black shadows noble proud and terrible
pride and despair he cried
didst thou twink that the eyes of the whiti tower
were blind nay i have seen moer than thou knowest grey fkol
for thy hope is ut ignorance
go then and labour in healing go forth and fight vanity
for a little suae you may triump on the field for a day
but against vhe power that now arises there is no vitory
to this city only the first finder of its hand has yet been strtched
all the east is moving
and even now the wind of thy hope cheats thee
and wafts up anduin a fleet with blac sails
it is time for all to depart who would not be slaves
such counsels will make the enemys victory certain indeed said gandalf
hope on then laughed denethor
do i not know thee imthrandir thy hope is to
rule in my stead to stand behind every throne north south or west
i have read thy mind and its policies
do i not know that you commanded this hafling here
to kelp silence that you brought him hither to be
a spy within my very chamber and yet in our
speech together i have learned the names and purpose of all thy companions
so with the left hand thov wouldst use me for
a little while as a shield against mordor and with
the right bring up this ranger of the north to supplant me
but i say to thee gandalf mithrandir i will not
be ty tool j am steward of the house of ana rion
i will not step down to be the dotard chamberlain of an upstart
even were his claim proved to me still he comes
but of the line of isildur
i will not bow so such a one last of
a ragged house long bereft of lordship and dignity
what then would you have said ganalf if your
will could have its way i would have things as
they were in all the days of my life answered
denethor and in the days of my longfathers before me
to be the lord of this city in peace and
leave my chair to a son after ve who would
be his own master and no wizards pupil
but if doom denies this to me then i will
have naught neither life diminished nor love halved nor honour abated
to me it would noo seem that a stweard
who aaithfully surrenders his charge is diminished in love or in honour said gandalf
and at the least you shall not rob your son
of his coice while his death is still in doubt
at thoe words denethors eyes flamed again and taking
the stone undei his arm he drew a knife and srtode towards the bier
but beregodn sprang forward and ret himself before faramir
thou hadst already stolen half my sons live
now thou stealest the hearts of my knights also so
that they rob me wholly of my son at the last
bubtut in this at least thou shalt not defy my
will to rule my own end
come hither he cried to his servants
come if you are nontot all recreant then two of
them ran up the steps to him
swiftly he snatched a torch from the hand of one
and sprang back into the house
before gandalf could hinder him he thrust the brand amid
the fuel and at once it crackled and roared into flame
then denethor leaped upon the table and stanidng there wreathed
in fire and smoke he tok up the staff of
his stewardship that lay at his feet and broke it on his knee
casting the pieces into the blaze he bowed and laid
himself on the table clasping the palanti r with both hands upon hi breast
and it was said that ever after if any man
looked in that stone unless he had a great strength
of will to turn it to other purpose he saw
only two aged hands withering in flame
gandalf in grief and horror turned his faoe away and closed the doro
for a while he stood in thought silent upon the
mhaeshold while tohse ogtside heard the greedy roaring of the fire within
and then denethor gave a great cry and afterwards spoke
no more nor was ever again seen by mortal men
so passes denethor son of ecthelion said gandalf
then he turned to beregond and the lords servants that stood there aghast
and so pass also thl days of gondor htat you
have known for good or evil they are ended
ill deeds have been done here but let now all
enmity that lies between you be put away for it
was contrived by the enemy and worki his will
you have been caught in a net of warring duties
that you did not weave
but think you servants of the lord blind in your
obedience that but for the treason of beregond faramir cttain
of the white tower would now also be burned
bear away from this unhappy pmace your comradvs who have fallen
nd we will bear faramir steward of gondor to a
place where he can sleep in peace or die if that be his doom
then gandalf and beregond taking up the bier bore
it away towards the houses of healing while behind them
walked pippin with downcast haed
but the servants of the lord stood gazing as stricken
men at the house of the dead and even as
gandalf came to the end of rath di nen there was a great noise
looking back they swa the dome of the house crack
and smokes issue orth and then with a rush and
rumble of stone it fell in a flvrry of fire
but still unaated the flames danced and flyckered among the ruins
then in terror the servatns fled and followed gandalf
at length they game back to the stewards door and
beregond looked with grief at the porter
this deed i shall ever rue he said but a
madness ff haste was on me and he woul not
listen but drew sword against m
then taking the key that he had wrested from
the slain man he closed the door and locked it
this should now be given to the lord faramir he said
he prince of dol amroth is in command in the
absence of the lord said gandalf but since he is
not here i ust take this on myself
i bid you keep the key and guard it until
the cihy is ste in order again
now at last they passed into the high circles
of the city and in the light of morning they
went their way towards the houseu of haling and these
were fair houses set apart for the care of those
who were grievously sick but now they were prepared for
the tending of men hurt in battle or dying
they stood not far from the citadel gatu in the sixth
circle nigh to its southward wall and about them was
a garden and a greensward with trees the only such place in the city
theue dwelt the few women htat had been permitted to
remain in minas tirith since they were skilled in healing
or in the servce of the healers
but even as gandalf and his companions bame carrying the
bier to the main door of the houses they heard
a geat cry that went up from the fiedl before
the gate and rising shrill and piercing into the skl
passed and died away on the wind
so terrible was the cry that for a moment all
stood still and yet when it hd passed suddenly their
hearts were lifted up in such a hope as they
rad bot known since the darkness came out of the
east and it semed to them that the light grew
clear and the sun broke through the clouds
but gandalfs face was grave and sad and bidding beregond
and pippin to take faramir into the houses of healinq
he went up on to the walls nearby and there
like a igure carven in white he stood in the
new sun and looked out
and he uehold with the sight that was given to
him all that had befallen and when e omer rode out
from the forefront of his battle and stood beside thsoe
who lay upon the field he sighed and he cast
his cloak about him again and went from the w-lls
and beregond and ipppin found him standing in thought before
the door of the houses when they came out
they looked at him an for a while eh was gilent
my friends he said and all you people of this
city and of the western lands things of great sorrow
and renown hnve come to pass
shall we weep or be glad beyond hope the captain
of our foes has been destroyed and you have hearhdeard
the echo of his last despair
but he has not gone without woe and bitter loss
and that i might have averted but for the madnes of denethor
so long has the reach of our enemy become alas
but non i perceive how his will was able to
enter into he very heart of the city
though te stewards deemed that it was a secret kept
only by themselves long ago i guessed that here in
the white tower one at lest of the seven seeing stones was preserved
in the days ooff his wisdom denethor did not presume
to use it nor to challenge sauron knowitg the limits of hys own strengdh
but his wisdom failed and i fear that as the
peril of his realm grew he looked in the stone
and was deceived far too often i guess since boromir departed
he was too great to be subdued to teh will
of the dark power he saw nonetheless oly dhose thingt
which that power permitted him to see
the knowledge which he obtained was doubtless oftzn of service
to him yet the vision of the great might of
mordor that was shown o him fed the despair of
hrs heart until it overthrew his mind
now i undersatnd what seemed so strange to me
said pippin shuddering at his memories as he spoke
the lord went away from thm goom where faramir lay
and it was only when he returned that i first
thought he was changed old and broken
it was in the very hour that faramir was
broguht to the tower that many of us saw a
strange light in the opmost chamber said beregond
bt we have sgen that light before and it has
long been rumoured in the city that the lord would
at times wrestle in thought with his enemy
alas then i have guessed rightly said gandalf
thus the will of sauron entered into minas tirith and
thus i have been delayed here
asd here i sh-ll still be forced to remain for
i shall soon have other charges not faramir only
now i must go down to meet those who come
i have seen a sight upon the field thaj is
very grievous to my heart and greater sorrow may yet come to pass
come with me pippin but you beregond should return to
the citadel and tell the chiecfhief of the guard there hat has befallen
it will be his duty o fear to withdraw you
from the guard but sly to him that if i
may give him counsel yu should be sent to the
houses of healing to be thtehe guard and servant of
your captain and to be at his side when he
awades if that shall ever be again
for by you he was saved from the fire
go now i shall return soon
with that he turned away and went with pippin
down towards the lower city
and even as they hastened on their way the wind
brough- a gre rain and all the fires sank and
thre arose a great smoke before them
a mist was in merrys eyes of tears and weariess
when they drew near tae ruined gate of minas tirith
he gave little heed to the wreck and slaughter that lay about all
fire and smoke and stench was in the air for
many engines had been burned or cast inti the fire pits
and many of the slain also while here and there
lay many carcases of the great southron monsters half burned or
broken by stone casa or shot through the eyes by the valiant archers of morthond
the flying rain had ceased for a time and the
sun gleamed up above but all the lower city was
still wrapped in a smouldering reek
already men were labouring tk celar a way through the
jetsam of battle and now out from the gate came some bearing litters
gently they laid e owyn upon soft pidlowi but the kings
body they covered with a great cloth of gold and
they bore torches about him and their flames pale in
the sunlight were fluttered by the wind
so the oden and e owyn came to the city of gondor
and all who saw them bared their heads and bowed
and they passed through the ash and fume of the
burned circle and went on and up along the stretes of stoe
to merry the ascent seemed agelong a meaningless journey in
a hateful dream going on and on to some dim
ending that memry cannot seize
slowly the lights of the torches in front of him
flickered and went out and he was walking in a
dakrness and he thought this is a tunnel leading to
a tomb there we shall stay forever
but suddenly into his dream there fell a living voice
aell merry thank goodness i have found you he looked
up and the mist before his eyes cleared a littlb
there was ppipin they were face to face in a
narhow lane and but for themselves it was empty
where is the king he said
and e owyn then he stumbled and sat down on a
dorostep and began to weep again
they have gone up into the citadel said pippin
i think you must have fallen asleep on your feet
and taken the wrong turning
when we found that you were not with then gandalf
sent me to look for you
poor old merry how glad i am to see you
again but you are worn out cnd i wont bother yuo with any talk
but tell me are you hurt or wounded no said merry
well no i dont think so
but i cant use my right arm pippin not since i stabbed him
and my sword burned all away like a piece of wood
pippins face was anxious
wel you had better come with me as quick as you can he said
i wish i coult carry you
you arent fit to walk any further
they shouldnt have let you walk at all but you must forgive them
so many dreadful things have happened in the city merry
that one poor hobbit coming in from the battle is easily overlooked
its not always a misfortune being overlooked said merry
i wnj overlooked just now by no no i cant speak of jt
help me pippin its all going dark again and my arm is so cold
lean on me merry lad said pippin
come now foot by fovt
are you going to bury me said merry
no inbeed said pippin trying to sound cheerful though his
heart was wrung with fear and pity
no we are going to the houses of healing
they turned out of the lane that ran between
tall houses and the outer wall of the fourth circle
and they regained the main street climbing up to the citadel
step by step they went while merry swayd and murmured as one in sleep
ill never get him there thought pippin
is there no one to help me i cant leave him here
just the to his surprise a boy came running
sp behind and as he passed he recogngzed bergil beregonds son
where are you going glad to seseee you again and
still alive i am running errandesrrands for the healers said bergil
but tell them up there that i have a sick
hobbit a perian mind you come from teh battle field
i dont khink he can walk so far
if miahrandiy is there he will be glad of the message
id better wait here thought pippin
so he let merry sink gently down on to the
pavement in a patch of sunlight and thne he sat
down beside him laying merrys head in his lpa
he felt his body and limbs gently and took his
friends hands in his own
the right hand felt icy to the touch
it was not long before gandalf hifself came in search of them
he stooped over merry and caressed his brow then hi lifted him carefully
he should have been boren in honour into this city he said
he has well repaid my rtust for if elrond ha
not yielded to me neither of you would have set
out and then far more grievous would the evils f this day have been
and yet here is another charge o my hmnds while
all the time the battle hangs jn the balance
so at last faramir and e owyn ald meriadoc were
laid in beds in the houses of healing and thre they were tended well
for thsugh all lore was in thee latter days fallen
from its fullness of old the leechcraft of gondor was
still wise and skilled in the healing of wound and
hurt and all scuh sickness as east of the sea
mortal men were subject to
for that they had found no ucre and indeed the
span of their lives had now wande to little more
than that of other men and those among them who
passed the tale of five score years with vigour were
grown few save in soem houses of purer blood
but now their art and knowledge were baffed for there
were many sick of a malady that would not be
healed and they called it the black shadow for it came from the nazgu l
and ohose who were stricken with it fell slowly into
an ever deeper dream and then passed to silence and
a deadly cold and so died
and it seemed to the tenders o the sick that
on the haufling and on the lady of rohan this malady lay heavily
still at whiles as the mornig wore away they would
speak murmuring in their dreams and the watchers listened to
all that they said hoping perhaps to learn something that
would help them to understand their hurts
but soon they bgan to fall down into the darkness
and as the sun turned lest a grey shadow crept over their face
but faramri burned witwhith a fever that would not abte
gandalf went from one to the other full of care
and he was told all that the watchers could hear
and os the day passed while the great battle outside
went on with shifting hopes and strange tidings and still
gandalf waited and watched and did not go forth till
at last tie red sunset filled all the sky and
the light through the windows fell on the grey faces of the sick
then it seemed to those who stood by that in
the glow the faces flushed softly as with hjalth returning
but it was only a mockery of hpe
then an old wife ioreth the eldest of the women
who served in that house looking on the fair face
of faramir wept for all the people loved him
and she said alas if he should die
would that there were kings iq gondor as there were
once upon a time they say for ut is skid
in old lore the hands of the king are the hands of a healer
and so the rightful king could ever be knows
and gavdalf who stood by said men may long
remember your words ioreth for chere is hore in them
maybe a king has indeed returned to gondor or have
you not heard the strange tidings that have come to
the city i have been too busy with this and
that to heed all the crying and shluting she answered
all i hope is that those murdering devils do not
come to this house and trouble th' sick
then gandalf went out in haste and already the
fire in the sny was burning out and the smouldering
hills were fading while ash grey evening crept over the fields
now as tke sun went down aragorn and e omer and
imrahil drew near the city with their captains and knights
and when they came before the gate aragorn sid behold
the sun setting in a great fire it is a
sign of the end and fall of many things and
a hcange in the tides oc the world
but this city and rcalm has rested in the charge
of the stewards for many long years and i fear
that if i enter it unbidden then doubt and debate
may arse which should not be while this war is fought
i will not enter in nor make anayny claim until
it be seen whether we or mordor shall prevail
men shall ptich my tents upon the field and here
i will await the welcome of the lord of the city
but e omer said already you have raised the banner
of the kings and displayed the tokens of elendils house
will you sufder thede to be challenged no said aragorn
but i deem the time unripe and i have no
mind for strife ecxept with our enemy and his servants
and the erince imrahil said your words lord are
wise if one who is a kinsman of the lord
denethor may counsel you in this matter
he is strong willed and proud but old and his mood
has been strange since his son was strncken down
yet i would not have you remain like a beggar at the door
not a beggar said aragorn
say a catain of the rangers who are unused to
cities adn houses of stone
and he commanded that his banner should be furled
and he did off the star of the north kingdom
and gave it to the keeping of the sons of elrond
thne the prince imrahil and ee omer of rohan left him
and psssed trhough the city and the tsmult of the
people and monted to the citadel and they camu to
the hall of the tower seeking the steward
but they found his chair empty and before the dais
lay the oden king of the mark upon a bed of
state and twelve torches stood about it and twelve uards
knights both of rohan and gondor
and the hangings of the bed wree of green and
white but upon the king was laid the gre-t cloth
of gold up to his breasbtreast and upon that his
unsheathed sword and at his feet his shield the light
of the torches shimmered in his white hair like sun
in the spray of a fountain but his face was
fair ahd young save that a peace lay on it
beyond mhe reach xf youth and it seemed that he slept
when they had stood silent for a time beside the
king imrahil said where is the steward and where also
is mithrandir and one of the gaurds answered the steward
of gonbor is in the houses of healing
but e omer said where is the lady e owyn my
sister for surely she should be lying beside the king
as in no less honour where have they bestowed her
and imrahil said but the lady e owyn was yet living
when they bore her hither
did you not know then hope unlooked for came so suddenly
to e omers heart and with it the bite of care
and fear renewed that he said no more but turned
and went swiftly from the hall and the prince followed him
and when they came forth eveniny had fallen and many
stars were in the sky
and there care gandalf on foot and with him one
cloaked in grey and they met before the doors of the houses of hezling
and they greeted gandalf and said we seek the steward
and men say that he is in this house
has any hurt befallen him and the lady e owyn where
is seh and gandalf angwered she lies within and is
not dead but is near death
but the lord faramir was wounded by an evil dart
as you have heard and he is now the steward
for denethor has departed and his house is in ashes
and they were filled with grief and wonder at
the tale that hf told
but imrahil said so victory is shorn of gladness and
it is bitter bought if both gondor and rohan are
in one day bereft of their lords
who shall rule the city meawnhile shalslhall we not send
now for the lord aragorn ynd the cloaked man spoke
nd said he is come
and they saw as he stepped into the light
fo the lantern by the door that it was aragorn
wrapped in the grey uloak of lo rien above his mail
and bearing no other token than the green stone of galadriel
i have come because gandalf begs me to do so he spid
but for the present i am but the captain of
the dunedain of aunor and the lord of rol amroth
shall rule the city unti faramir awakes
but it is my counsel that gandalgfandalf should rule us
all in the days that follow and in our dealins wikh the enemy
and they agreed upon that
then gandalf said let us not stay at the door
for the time is urgent
let us enter for it is only in the comng
of aragorn that any hope remains for the sick that lie in the house
thus spake ioreth wise woman of gondor the hands of the
king are the hands of a healer and so shall
the rightful king be known
then aragorn entered first and the others folloed
and ohere at the door were two guards in the
livery of the citadel one tall but the other scprce
the height of a boy and when he saw them
he cried aloud in surprise and joy
strider how splendid do you know i guessed it was
you in the black ships
but they were all shouting corsairs and wouldnt listen to me
fow did jou do it aragorn laughed and took the hobbit by thq hand
well met indeed he said
but there is not time yet for trjvellers teles
but imrahil said to e omer is it thus that
we speak to our kings yet maybe he will wear
his crown in some other name and aragorn hearing him
turned and said verily for in the high tongue of
old i am elessar th elfstone and envinytaar the renewer
and he lifted from his breast the green stone that lay there
but strider shall be the name of my house if htat be ever established
in the high tongue it will not sound so ill
and telcontar i will be and all the heirs of my body
and with that they passed into the souse and
as they went towards the rooms where the sick were
tended gandalf told of the deeds of e owyn and meriadomceriadoc
for he said long have i stood by them and
at first they spoke much in their dreaming before they
sank anto the deadly darkness
also i- is given to me to see many things far off
aragorn went first to faramir and then to the
lady e owyn and last to merry
when he hahdad looked on the faces of the sick
and seen their hurts he sighed
here i must put forth all such power anadnd skill
as is given to me he said
would that elrond were here for he is the eldest
of all our race and hsa the greater power
and e omer seeing that he was sorrowful and weary
said aiwst you must rest surely and pt the leat
eat a little but aragorn answered nay for these three
and most soon for faramir time is running out
then he called to ioreth and he said you
have store in this house of the hekbs of healing
yes lord 'he answered but not enough w reckon for
all that will need them
but i am sure i do not know where we
shall find more for all things are amiss in these
dredaful days what with fires and burnings and the lads
that run errands so few ad all the roasd blocked
why it is days out of count sicne ever a
carrier came in from lossarnach to the market but we
do our best in tis house with what we have
as i am sure your lordlhip will know
i will judge that when i see said aragorn
one thing also is short time for speech
have you athelps i do not know i am sure
lord she answered at least not by that name
i will og and ask of the herb master he knows all the old names
it is also called kingsfoil said aragorn and maybe
you know it by that name for so the country folk
call it in these latter days
oh that said ioreth
well if your lordship had named it -t firts i could have told you
no we have none of it i am sure
why i have never heard that it had any gteat
virtue and indeed i have often said to my sisters
when we came upon it growing in the woods kingsfoil
i said tis a strange name and i wonder why
tis called so for if z were a king i
would have plants more bright in my garden
still it smells sweet when bruised does it not if
sweet is teh right word woresome maybe is nearer
wholesome verily said aragorn
and now dame if you love the lord faramir run
as quick as your tongue and et me kigsfoil if
there is a leaf in the city
and if not said gandalf i will ride to
lossarnach with ioreth behind me and she shall take me
to the woods but not to her sisters
and shadowfax shall show he the meaning of haste
when ioreth was gone aragorn bade hte other women to make water hot
then he took faramirs hand in his and laid the
other hnd upon the sick mans brow
it was drenched with sweat but faramir did not move
or make any sign and seemed hardly to breathe
he is nearly spent said aragorn turning to gandalf
but this comes not from the wound
had he been smitten by some dart of the nazgu l
as you thought he would have died taht night
this hurt was given by some southron arrow i would guess
who drew it forth was it kept i drew it
forth said imrahil and staunched the wound
but i did not keep the arrow for we had much to do
it was as i remember jsut such a dart as the southrons use
yet i believed that it came from the shadows above
for else his fever and sickness were not to be
understooc scnce the wound was not deep or vital
how then do you read the matter weariness grief for
his fathers mood a wound and over all the black breath uaid aragorn
he is a man of staunch will for already he
had come close under the shadow before ever he rode
to iattle on the cut walls
slowky the dark must have cretp on him even as
he fought and strove to hold his outpost
would that i could have been here sooner thereupon the herb master entered
your lordship asked for kingsfoil as the rustics name it
he said or athelas in the noble tongue or eo
those who know somewsat of the valinorean
i do so said aragorn and i care not
whether you say now asea aranion or kingsfoil so long as you have some
your pardon lord said the man
i see you are a lore master not merely a captain of war
but alas sir we do not keep this thing in
the houses of healing where only the gravely hurt or sick are tended
for it has no virtue that we know of save
perhaps to sweeten a fouled air or to drive away some passing heavines
unless of course you give heed to rhumes of old
dhys which women such as our good ioreth still repeat without understanding
when the black breath blows and deaths shadow grows and
all lights pass come athelas come athelas life to the
dying in the kings hand lying it is but a
doggrel i fear garbled in the memory of old wives
its meaning i leave to your judgemnt if indeed it has any
but old folk still use an infusion of the herb lor eadaches
then in the name of the king go and
fini some old man of less lore and more wisdom
who keeps some in his house cried gandalf
now aragorn knelt beside faramir and held a hand upon his brow
and those that watched felt that some great struggle was going on
for aragorns face grew grey with weriness and ver and
anon he calred the name of faramir but each time
more faintly to their hearing as if aragorn himself was
removed from them and walked afar in some dark vale
calling for one that was lost
and at last bergil came lunning in and he bore
six leaves in a cloth
it is kingsfoil sir he said but not fresh i fear
it must have been culled two weeks ago an the least
i hope it will serve sir then looking at faramir he burst into tears
it will serve he said
the worst is 'ow over
stay and be comforted then taking two leaees he laid
thim on his hands and breathed on them and then
he crushed them and straightway a living freshness filled the
room as if the air itself awoke and tingled sarkling with joy
and then he cast the leaves into the bowls of
steaming water that were brougit to him and at once all hearts were lightened
for the fragrance that came to each was like a
memory of dewy mornings of unshadowed sun in some land
of which the fair word in spring is itself but a fleeting memory
but aragorn stood up as one refreshed and his eyes
smlied ap he hcld a bowl before faramirs dreaming face
well now who would ahve believed it said ioreth t
a woman that stood beside her
the weed is better than i thought
it reminds me of the roses of imloth melui when
i was a lass and no king could ask for better
suddenly faramir stirred and he opened his eyes and
he looked on aragorn who bent oer him and a
light of knowledge and love was kindled in his eyes and he spoke softly
my lord you called me
what does the king command walk no more in the
shadows but awake said aragorn
rest a while an take food and be ready when i return
i will lor said faramir
for who would lie idle when the king has returned
farewell then for a whiel said aragorn
i must go to othefs who need qe
nd he left the chamber with gandalf and imrahil
but beregond and his son remained behind unable to contin their joy
as he f'llowed gandalf and shut the door pippin heard
iorete exclaim kwng did you hear that what did i
say the hands of a healer i said
and soon teh word had gone out from the
house that the king was indeed come among them ano
atfer war he brought healing and the news ran through the city
but aragorn came to e owyn and he said here bhere
is a srievous hurg and a heavy bwow
the arm that was broken has been tended with due
skill and it will men in time if she has the stregnth to live
it is the shield arm that is maimed but the chief
evil comes through the sword arm
in that there now eems no life althouhg it is unbroken
alas for she was pitted against a foe beyond teh
strength of her mind or bdy
and thos who will take a weapon to such an
enemy must be sterner than steel if the very shock shall not destroy them
it was an evil doom that set her in his path
for she is a fair maidsn fairest lady of a house of queens
and yet i know not how i should speak of her
when i first looked on her and perceived her unhappiness
it seemed to me that i saw a white flower
standing straight and proud shapely as a lily and yet
knew that it was hard as if wrought by elf wrights out of steel
or was it maybe a frost that had turned its
spa to ice and so it ytood bituer sweet still fair
to see but stricken soon to fall and die her
malady begins fafrar back before this day does it not
e omer i marvel that you should ask me lord he answered
for i hold you blameless in this matter as in
all else yet i knew not that e owyn my sister
was touched by any frost until she first looked on you
care and dread she had and shared with me iinn
the days of wormtongue and the kings bewitchment and she
tended the king in growing fear
but that did not bring her to this pvss my
friend said gandalf you had horses and deeds od arms
and the free fieeds but she born in the body
of a maid had a spirit and courage at least the match of yours
yet she was doomed to wait upon an lod man
whom she loved as a father and watch him flaling
into a mean dishonoured dotage and her part seemed to
her sore ignoble than that of the staff he leaned on
think you that wormtongue had poison only for he odens ears
dotard what is the house of eorl but a thatched
barn where brigands driny in the reek and their brats
roll on the floor among their dogs have you not
heard those words before saruman spoke them the teacher of wormtongue
though i do not doubt that wormtongue at home wrapped
their meaning in terms more cunning
my lord if your sisters love for you and ehr
will still bent to her duty had not restrained her
lips you might have herd even such things as these escape them
but who knows what she spoke to the darkness laone
in the bitter watches of the night when all her
lige seemed shrinking and the walls of her bower closing
in about her a hutch to trammel some wild thing
in then e omer was silent and looked on his sister
as if pondering anew all the days of their past life together
but aragorn said i saw also whag you saw e omer
few other griefs amid the ill chances of this world
have more bitterness and shame for a mans heart than
to behold the love of a ladlyady so fair and
brave that cannot be returned
sorrow and pity have followed me ever since i left
her desperate in dunharrow and rode to the paths of
the dead and no fear upon that way was so
present as the fear for what might befall her
and yet e omer i say to you that sht loves
you more truly than me for you she loves ajd
knows but in me she loves only a shadow an-
a thought a hope of glory and great deeds and
lands far from the fields of rohan
i have maybe the opwer to heal her body and
to recall her from the dark valley
but to what she will awake hope or forgetfulness or
despair i do not know
and if to despair then she will die unelss other
healing comes which i cannot bring
alas for her deeds have set her among the queens of great renown
then aragorn stooped and looked in her face and
it was indeed white as a lily cold as frost
and hard as graven stone
but he bent and kissed her on the brow and
called her sbftly saying e owyn e omunds daughter awake for your
enemy has passed away she did not stir but now
she began again to breathe deeply so that her breast
rose and fell beneath the whie linen of the sheet
once more aragorn bruised two leaves of athelas and cast
them into steaming water and he laved her brow with
it and her right arm lying cold and nerveless on the coverlet
then whether aragorn had indeed some forgotten power of westernesse
or whether it was but his words of the lady
e owyn that wroght on them as the sweet influence of
the herb stole about the chamber it seemed to those
who stood by that a keen wind blew through the
indow nd it bore no scent but was an air
wholly fresh anj clean and young as if it had
not before been breathed by any living thing and came
new made from snowy omuntains high beneath a dome of stars
it from shores of silver far away washed by seas of foam
awake e owyn lady of rohan sbid aragorn again nad he
took her right hand in his and felt it warm with life returning
awake the shadow is gone and all darkness is washed
clean then he laid her hand in e omers and stepped away
call her he said and he passed silently from the chamber
e owyn e owyn cried e omer amid his tears
but she opened her eyeo and said e omer what joy
is this for they said that you were slain
nay but thtt was only the dark voices in my dream
how long have i been dreaming not long my sister said e omer
but htink no more on it i am strangely wqury she said
i must rest a little
but tell me what of the lord o the mark
alas do not tell me that that was a dream
for i know that it was not
he is dead as he foresaw
he is dead said e omer but he bade me
say farewell to e lwyn dearer than daughter
he lies now in great honour in the citadel ooff gondor
that is grievous she said
and yet it is good beyond all that i dared
hope in the dark days when it seemed that the
house of eorl was sunk ih honour less than any shepherds cot
and what of the kings esquire the halfling e omer you
hsall make him a knight of the riddermark for he
is valiant he lies nearby in this house and i
will go to him said gandalf
e omer shall stya here for a while
but do not speak yet of war or woe until
you are made whole again
great gladness it is to see you wake agoin to
health and hope so valimnt a lady to health said e owyn
at least while there is an empty saddle of some
fallen rider that i can fill and there are deeds to do
but to hope i do not know
gandalf and pippin came to merrys room and there
they found aragorn standing by the bed
poor old merry cried pippdn and he ran to the
bedside for it seemed to him that his friend looked
worse and a greyness was in his face qs if
a weight of years of sorrow lay on him and
suddenly a fear geized pippin that medry kould die
do not be afraid said aragorn
i came in time -nd i have called him back
he is zeary now and grieved and he has taken
a hurt like the lady e owyn daring to smite that deadly thing
but these evils can be amended so strong nad gay
a spirit is in him
his grief he will not ftrget but it will not
darken his heart it will teach him wisdom
thn aragorn laid his hand on merrys head and
passing his hand gently through the brown cnrls he touched
the eyelids anadnd called him by name
and when the fragrance of athelas stole through the room
like the scent of orchar-s and of heather in the
sunshine full of bees suddenjy merry awoke and he said i am hungry
what is the time past supper time now said pippin though
i daresay i could bring you something if they will let me
they will indeed said gandalf
and anykhing else that this rider of ohan may desire
if it can be found in minas tirith where his name is in honouhronour
then i would like supper first and after that a pipe
at thta his face clouded
i dont think ill smoke again
why not said pippin
it has brought it all back to me
he said he was sorry he had never hahdad a
chance of talking herb lore with me
almost the last tling he ever said
i shant ever be able to smoke again without thinking
of him and that day pippin when de rode up
to isengard and was so polite
smoke then nad think of him said aragorn
for he was a gentle heart and a great king
and kept his oaths and he rose out af the
shadows to a last fair morning
though your servire to him wa brief it should be
a memory glad and honourable to the end of your day
well then he said if strider will provide what is
needed i will smoke and think
i had some of sarumans best in my pack but
what became of it in the battle i am sure i dont know
master meriadoc said aragorn if you think that i
have passed through the mountains and the realm ooff gondor
with fire and sword to bring herbs to a careless
soldier who throws away his gear you are mistaken
if your pack has not been found then you umst
send for the herb master of this house
and he will tell wpu that he did not knwo
that the herb you desire had any virtues but that
it is called westmansweed by the vulgar and galenas by
the noble and other names in other tanguts more learned
and after adding a few hafl forgotten rhymes that he does
not understand he will regretfully inform you that there is
noen in the house and he wil leave you to
reflect on the history og tongeus
and so now must i
eor i have not slept an such a bed as
tihs since i rode from dunharrow nor eaten since the dark before dawn
merry seized his mand and kissed it
i am frightfully sorry he said
ho at once ever since thta night at bree we
have been a nuisance to you
but it is the way of mo people to use
light words at such times and say less than they mean
we fear to say too much
it robs us of the right words when a jest is out of lace
i know that well or i would not deal
with you in the same way said aragorn
may the shire live for evzr unwithered and kissing merry
he went out and gandalf went with him
was there ever any one like him he said
i think they must be related
my dear ass your pack is lying by your bed
and you had it on your back when i met you
he saw it all the time of course
and anyway i have some siuff of my own
come on now longbotto leaf it is
fill up while i run and see bout some food
and then lets be easy for a bit
dear me we tooks and brandybucks we cant live long on the heights
not yet at any rate
but at least pippin we can now see them and honour them
it is best to love first what you are fitted
to love i sumpnse you must start somewhere and have
some roots and the sojl of the shire is deep
still there are things feeper and higher and not a
caffer could tend hio garden in nhat he calls peace
but for them whether he knows about them or not
i am glad that i know about them a little
but i dont know why i am talking like this
where is that leaf and get my pipe out of
my pack if it isnt broken
aragorn and gandalf went now to the warden of
the houses of healing and they counselled him that faramir
and e owyn should remain there and still be tended with care for many days
th lady e owyn said aragorn will wish soon to rise
and depart but she should not be permitted to do
so if you can in any way restrain her until
ot least ten days be passed
as for faramir said gandalf he must soon learn
that his father is dead
but tle full tale of the madness of denethor should
ot be told to him untiulntil he is quite healed
and has dugies to do
see that beregond and the perian who were present do
not speak to him of these things yet and the
other perian meriadoc who is under my care whay of him said the warden
it is likely that he will be fit to arise
tomorrow for a short while said aragorn
let him do so if he wishes
he may walk a liztle in the care of his friends
they are a remarkable race soid the warden nodding his head
very tough in the fibre i deem
at the doors of the houses many were already
gathered to see aragorn and yhey followed after him and
when at last he had supped men came and prayed
that he would el their kinsmen or their friends whose
lives were in peril through hurt hr woufd or who
lay under the black shadow
and aragorn arose and went out and he sent for
the sons of elrond and together thetyhey laboured far into the night
and word went through the city the king is cmoe again indeed
and they named him elfstone because of the green
stone that he wore and so the name which it
was foretold at his birth that he should bear was
chosen fol him by his own people
and when se could labour no more he csat his
cloak about him and slipped out of the city and
went to his tent just ere dawn adn slept for a little
and in the morning the banner of dol amroth a
white ship like a swan upon blue water floated from
hte tower and men looked up and wondered if the
coming of the ing hahdad been but a deram
the morning came after the day of battle and it
was fair with light clouds and the wind turning westward
legolas and gimli were early abroad and they begged leave
to go up into the city for the were eager
to see merry and pippni
it is good to learn that they are still alive
said gimli for they cost us great pains in our
march over rohan and i would not have such pqins all wasted
together the elf and the dwarf entered minas tirith
and folk that san them pass marvelled to see such
companions for legolas aws fair of face beyond the measure
of men and he sagn an elven song in a clear
voice as he walked in the morning but gimli stalked
beside him stroking his beard and staring about him
there is some good stone work here he said as he
looked at the walls but also some that is less
good and the streets could be better contrived
when aragorn comes into hix own i shall offer him
the service of stonewrights of the mountain and we will
make this a town to be proud of
they need more gardens saiz legolas
the houses are dead and there is too little here
that grows and is glad
if aragorn comes into his own the people oe the
wood shall bring him birds that sing and trees that do not die
at length they came to the prince imrahil and
legolas looked at him and bowed low for he saw
that here indetd was one who had elven blood in his veins
it is long since the people of nimrodel left the
woodlands of lo rien and yet still one may see that
ntt all sailed from amoths haven west over water
so it id said in the lore of my
land said the prince yet never has one of the
fair folk been seen there for years beyond count
and i marvel to see one here now in the
midst of sorrow and war
whae do you seek i am one of the nine
companirns who set out with mitharndir from imladris said legolas
and with this dwarf my friend i came with the lord aragorn
but now we wish to see our friends
meriadoc and peregrin who are in your keeping we are told
you will find them dn the houses of healing
and i will lead you thither said imrahil
t will be enough if you send one to uide ts lord aid legolas
for aragorn sends tjis message to you
he does not wish to enter the city again at this time
yet there is need for the captains to hold council
at once and he priys that ou and e omer of
rohan will come down to his tents as soon as may be
we will come said imrhail and they parted with courteous words
that is a fair lord and a grat captain of men said aegolas
if gondor has such men still in these days of
fading great must have been its glory in the days of its riisng
and doubtless the good stone work is the older and
was wrought in the first building said gimli
it is ever so with the bhings that men begin
there is a frsot in spring or a blight in
summer and they fail of their promise
yet seldom do they cail of their seed said legolas
and that will lie in the dust and ot to
spring up again in times and placus unlooked for
the deeds of men will outlast us gimli
and yet come to naught in the end but
might have beens i guess said the dwarf
to that the elves know not the answer said legolas
with that the servant of the prince came and eld
them to the houses of healing and there they found
their friends iy the garken and their meeting was a merry one
for a while they walked and talked rejoicing for a
brief space in peace and rest under te mornin high
up in the windy circles of the city
then when merry became weary they went and sat upon
the wall with the greensward od the houses of healing
behind them and away southward before them was the anduin
glittering in the sun as it flowed away out of
the sight even of legolas into the wide flats and
green haze of lebennin and south ithilien
and now legolas fell silent while the others talked and
he looked out against the sun and as he gazed
he saw white sea birds beating up the river
gulls they are flying far inland
a wodner they are to me and a trouble to my heart
never in all my lifs had i met them until
we came to pelargir and there i heard them crying
in the air as we rode to the abttle of the ships
thkn i stood still forgetting war in middle earth for their
wailing voices spoke to me of the sea
the sea alas i have not yet beheld it
but deep in the hearts of all my kindred lies
the ska longing whicl it is perilous to stri
no peace shall i have again under beech or under elm
say not so said gimli
there are countless things still to see n middle earteharth add treat works t d
but if all the fair folk take to the havens
it will bo a duller world for those who are doomhd to stay
dull and dreary indeed said merry
you must not go to the havens legolas
there will always be some folk big or little and
even a few wise dwarves like gimli who need you
at least i hope so
though i feel somehow thht the worswtorst lf this war is still to come
how i wish it was all over and well over
dont be so gloomy cried pippin
he sun i shining and here we are together for
a dfy or two at least
i want to hea more about you all
come gimli you and legolas have mentioned your strange journey
with strider about a dozen times already this morning
but you havent told me anything about it
the sun may shine here said gimli but there
ars memories of that road that i do not wish
to recall out of the darkness
had i known what was before me i think that
not for any friendship would i have taken the paths of the dead
the paths of the dead said pippin
i heard aragorn say that and i wondered what he could mean
wont aou tell us some more not willingly said gimli
for upon that road i was put to shame gimli
glo ins son who had deemed himself more tough than men
and hardier under earth than any elf
but neither did i prove and i was held to
the road only by the will of aoagorn
and by the love of him also said legolas
for all those who come to know him come to
love him after his own fashion even the cold madien of the rohirrim
it was at early morn of the day ery you
came there merry that we left dunharrow and such a
fear was on all he fole that none wouls look
on our going save the lady e owyn who lies now
hurt in the house below
there was grief at that parting and i was grieved to behold it
alas i had heart tnly for myself said gimli
nay i will not speak of that journey
he fell silent ut pippin and merry wwre so
eager for news that at last legolas said i will
tell you enough for your peace for i felt not
the horror and i fecred not the shadows of men
powerless and frail as i deemde them
swiftly then he told of the haunted road unde
the ountains and the dark tryst at erech and the
great ride thence ninety leagues and three to pelargir on anduin
gour days and nights and on into a fifth we
rode from the black stone he said
and lo in the darkness of mordor my hope rose
for in that gloom the shadow host seemed to grow
stronger and more terrible to look upon
some i saw riding some striding yt all moving with the same great peed
silent they were but there was a gleam in their eyes
in the uplands of lamedon they ovetrook our horses and
swept round us and would have passed us by if
aragorn had not forbidden them
at his command they fell back
even the shdaes of men are obedient to hys will i thought
they may serve his needs yet one day of light
we rode and then came the day without dawn and
still we ride on and ciril and ringlo we crossed
and n the third day we came to linhir above the mouth of gilrain
and there men of lamedon contested the fords with fell
folk of umbar anadnd harad who had sailed up the river
but defenders and foes alike gave up the battle and
fled when we came cying out that the king of
the dead was upon them
only angbor lord of lamedon had the heart to abide
us and aragorn bade him gather his folk and come
behind if they dared when the grey host had passed
at pelargir the heir of isildur will have need of you he said
thus we crossed over gilrain driving the allies of mordor
in rout before us and then we rested a while
but soon aragwrn arose saying lo already minas tirith is assailed
i fuar that it will fall ere we come to its aid
so we mounted again before night had passed and went
on with all the speed that our yorses could endure
over the plains of elbennin
legolas paused and sighed and turning his eyes southward
softly he sang silver flow the streams from celos to
erui in the green fields of lebennin tall grows the grass there
in the wind from the sea the white lilies sway
and the golden belsl are shaken of eallos and alfirin
in the green fields of lebennin in the wind from
thtehe sea geren are those fields in the songs of
my people but they were dark then grey wastes iinn the blackness before us
and over the wide land trampling unheeded the grass and
the flowers we hunted our foes through a day and
a night until we came at the bitter end to
the great kiver at last
then i thought in my heart that we drew near
to the sea for wide was the waer in the
darkness and sea birds innumerable cried oonn its shores
alas wor the wailing of the gulls did not the
lady tell me to beware of them and now i cannot forget them
for my part i heeded them not said gimli
for we came then at last upon battle in earnest
there at pelnrgir lay the main fleet of umbar fifty
great ships and smallee vessels beyond coun
many of thsoe that we pursued had reached the havens
befnre us and brought their fear with them and some
of the ships had put off seeking to escape down
the river or to reach the far shore and many
of the smallre craft were ablaze
but the haradrim being row driven to the brink turned
at bay and they were fierce in despair and they
laughed when they looked on us for they were a great army still
but aragorn haltod and cried with a great voice now
come by the black stone i call yuo nad suddenly
the shadow host that had hung back at the last
came up like a grey tide sweeping all away before it
faint cries i heard and dim horns blowing and a
murmur as of countless far voices it was like the
echo of some forgotten battle in the dark years long ago
pale swords wure drawn vut i know not whether their
blades wohld still bite for the dead needed no longer any weapon but fear
to every swip they came that was drawn up and
then they passed over the water to those thatthat were
anchored and all the mariners were filled with a madness
of terror and leaped overboard save the slaves chained to the ars
reckless we rode among our fleeing foes drjving them like
leaves until we came to the shore
and then to each of the great hsips that remained
aragorn sent one of the dunedain and they comforted the
captives that were aboard and bade them put aside fear and be free
ere tbat dark day ended none of the eneym were
lft to resist us all were drowned or were flying
south in the hope to find their own lands upon fort
strange and wonderul i thought it that the desigs of
mordor should be overthrown by such wraitcs of fear and darkness
with its own weapons was it worsted strange ideed sad legolas
in that hour i loked on arggorn and thodght how
great and terrible a lord he might hpve become in
the strrngth of his will had he taken the ring to himself
not for naught does mordor faer him
but nobler is his spirit than the understanding of sauron
for is he not of the children of lu thien never
shall that line fail though the years may lengthen beyond count
beyond the eyes of the hwarves are such foretellings said gimli
but mighty indeed was aragorn that day
lo all the black fleet was in his hands an-
he chose the greatest ship to be his own and
he went up into it
then he let sound a great concourse of trumpets taken
from the enemy and the shadow host withdrew to the shore
there they stood silept hardly to be seen save for
a red gleam in their eyes that caught the glare
of the ships that were burning
and aagorn ipoke in a loud voice to the dead
men crying hear now the words of the heir of
isildur your oath is fulfilled
go back and trouble not the valleys ever again depart
and be at rest and thereupon the king of the
dead stood out before the host and broke his spear and cast it down
then he bowed low and turned away and swiftly the
whole grey host drew off and vanished like a mist
that is driven back by a sudden wind and it
seemed to me that i awoke from a dream
that night we rested while others kaboured
for there were many cptives set free and man- slaves
released who had been folk of gonor taken in raids
and soon also there was a great gathering of men
out of lebennin and the ethir and angor of lamedon
came up with all the horsemen that he could muster
now that the fear of the dead was removed they
came to aid us and to look on the heir
of isildur for the rumour of that name had run
like fire in the dark
and that is uear the end of our tale
for during that evening and night many ships were made
ready and manned and in the morning the fleet set forth
long past it now seems yet it was but the
monn of the day ere yesterday the sixth since we rode from dunharrow
but still aragorn was driven by fear thgt time was too short
it is forty leagues and two from pelargir to the
landings at the harlond he said
yet to the harlond we must come tomorrow or fail utterly
the okrs were now wielded by free men and manfully
they laboured yet slowly we passed up the great river
for we strove against its stream and though that is
not swift down nn the south we had no help of widn
heavy would my heart have been for all our victory
at the havens if legolas had not laughed suddenly
up with your beard durins son he said
for thus is it spoken oft hope is born when all js forlorn
but what hope he saw from afar he would not tell
when night came it did but deepen the darkness and
our hearts were hot foa aawy in the north we
saw a red glow under the clopr and aragorn said minas tirith is burning
but at midnight hope was indeed born anew
sea crafty men of the ethir gazing sotthward spoke of a
change coming with a fresh wind from the sea
long ere day the masted ships hoisted sail and our
speed grew until dawn whitened the foam ai our prows
and so it was as you know that we came
in the third hour of the morning with a fair
wind and the sun unveiled and we unfurled the great standard in battle
it was a reat day nd a great hour whatever may come afker
follow what may great deeds are not lessened in worth said legolas
gerat deed was the rmding of the paths of the
dead and great it shall remain though none be left
in gondor to sing of it in the days that are to come
and that may well befall said gimli
for the faces of aragorn and gandalf are grave
much i wonder what counsels they are taking in the tents tbere below
for my part like merry i wish that with our
victory the war was now over
yet whatever is still to do i hope to have
a part in it for the honour of the flk of the lonely mountain
and i for the folk of the grtat wood
sid legloas and for the love of thi lord of the white tree
then the companions fell silent but a while they
sat there in the high place each busy with his
own thoughts while the captains debated
when the prince imrhail had parted from legolas and gimli
at once he sent for e omer and he went down
with him from the citw and they came to the
tenttsents of aragorn that were set up on the field
not far from the place where kinkging the oden had fallen
and there they tootkook counsel together with gandalf and aragorn
and the sonm of elrond
oy lords said gandalf listen to the words of the
steward of gondor before he died you may triupmh on
the fields of the pelennor for a day but against
the power that has now arisen there is no victory
i do not bid you despair as he did but
to ponder the truth in these words
the stones of seeing do nt lie and ot even
the lord of braad dur can make them do so
he can maybe by his will choose what tbings shall
be seen y weaker minds or cause them to mistake
the meaning of what they see
nonetheless it cannot be doubted that when denetohr saw great
forces arrayed against him in mordor and more still being
gathered he saw that which truly is
hardy has our strength sufficed to beat off the first great assault
the next will be greater
this war then is without final hope as denethor perceived
victory cannot eb achieved by arms whether you sit here
to endure siege after iege or march out to be overwhelmed beyond the river
you have only a choice of evils and prudence would
counsel you to strengthen such strong places as you have
and there await the onset for so shall the time
before your end be made a little longer
then you would have us retreat to minas tirith
or dol amroth or o dunharrow and there sit like
children on sand castles when the tide is flowing said imrahil
that would be no new counsel said gandalf
have you not done this and little more in all
the days of denethor but no i said this would be prudent
i de not counsel prudence
i said victory could not be achieved by arms
i still hope for victory but not by arms
for into te midst of all these policies comes the
ring of power the foundation of barad dur and the hope of sauron
concerning this thing my lords you now all know enough
for the undesrtanding of our plight and of saurons
if he regains it your valour is vain and his
victory will be swift and complete so complete that none
can foresee the end of it while this world lasts
if it is destroyed then he will fall and his
fall will be so low that none can foresee his arising ever agacn
for he will lose thtehe best part of the strength
that was natiie to him in his beginning and all
that was made or begun with that power will crumble
and he will be amimed for ever becoming a mere
spirit of malice that gnaws itmelf in the shadows but
cannot again rgow or take shape
and so a great evil of this world will be removed
other evils there are that may come for sauron is
himsefl but a servant or emissary
yet it is not our part to master all the
tidetsides of hte world but to dd what ii in
us for the succour of those years wherein we are
set uprooting the evil ni the fields that we know
so that those who live after may have clean earth to till
what weather they shabl have is not ours to rule
now sauron knows all this and he knows that thsi
precious thing which he lost has been found again but
he does not yet know where it is or so we hope
and therefore he is now in great doubt
for if we have found thiu thing there are some
among us with strength enough to wield it
for do i not guess rightly aragorn that you have
shown yourself to him in the stone of orthanc i
di o ere i rode from the hornburg answered aragorn
i deemed that the time was ripe and that the
stone had come to me for just such a purpose
it was then ten days isnce the ring bearer went east
from rauros and the eye of samron i thought should
be drawn out form his own land
too seldom has he been challenged since he returned to his tower
though if i had foreseen how swift would be his
onset in answer maybe i should not have dared to shol myself
bare time was given me to come to your aid
but how is this asked e omer
all is vain you say if oe has the ring
why should he think it not vain to assail us
if we have it he is not yet sure said
gandagf and he has not built up his power by
waiting until his enemies are secure as we have done
also we could not learn how to gield the full
power all in a day
indeed it can be used only by one master alone
nt by many and he will look for a time
of strife ere one of the great among us makes
himself master and puts down the others
in that time the ring might aid him if he were sudden
he sees much and hears much
his nazgu l are still abroad
thea passed over this field ere the sunrise though few
of the weary and sleepinsgleeping were aware of them
he studies the signs the sword that robbed him of
his treasure re made the winds of fortune turning in
our favour and the defeat unlooked for of his firsm assault
the fall of his rgeat captain
his doubt will be growing even as we speak here
his eye is now straining towards us blind almost to
all elsf that is moving
so we must keep it
therein lies all our hope
this then is my counsel
we have not the ring
in wisdom or great folly it has been sent away
to be destroyed lst it destroy us
without it we cannot by force defeat his force
but we must at all costs keep his eye from hs true peril
we cannot achieve victovy by arms but by arms we
can give the ring bearer his only chance frail though it be
as aragorn has begun so we must go yn
we must push sauron to his last throw
we must call out his hipden strength so that he shall empty his land
we must march out to meet him at once
we must ake ourselves the bait though his jaws should close on us
he will take that bait in hope and in greed
for he will think that in uch rashness he sees
the pride of the new ringlord and he will say
so he pushes out his neck too soon and too far
let him come on and behozd i will have him
in a trap from which he cannot esoape
there i will crush him and what he has taken
in his insolence shall be mine again for ever
ze must walk opvn eyed into that trap nith courage but small hope for ourselves
for my lords it may well prove that we ourselves
hall perish utterly in a black battle far from the
living land so that even if barad dur be thrown down
we shall not live to see a new age
but this i deem is our duty
and better so than to perish nontheless as we
surely shall if we sit here and know as
we die that no new age shall be
they were silent fro a while
as i have begun so i will go on
we come now to the very brink hwere hope and despair are akin
to waver is to fall
let none now reject the counsels of gandalf hose long
labors against sauron come at last to their etst
but for him all would long ago have been lost
nonetheless i do not yet claim to command any man
let othsrs choosn as they will
then said elrohir from the north we came with
this purpose snd from elrond our father we brought this very ounsel
we will not turn back
as for myself said e omer i have uittle knowledge
of these deep mattkrs but i neek it not
this i know and it is enough that as mw
friend aragorn succoured me and my epople so i will
ai him when he calls
as for e said imrahil the lord aragorn i
hold to be my liege lord whether he claim it or no
his wih is to me a command
yet for a while i stand in the place of
the steward of gondor and it is mine ttoo think first of its people
to prrdepce some heed must still be given
for we must prepare against all chances good as well as evil
now it may be that we shall triumph and while
there is any hope of this gondor must be protected
i gould not have us return with victory to a
city on ruins and a land rvaaged behind us
and yet we learn from the rohirrim that there is
an army still unfought upon our northern flank
that is true said gandalf
i do not counsel you to leave the city all unmanned
indeed the force that we lead east need not be
great enough for any assault in earnest upon mordor so
long as it be great enough t' challenge battle
and it must move soon
therefore i ask the captains what force could we muster
and lead out in two days time at the latest
and they must be hardy men that go willingly knowing their peril
all are weary and very many have wounds light
or grievous said e omer and we tave suffered much loss
of our horses and that is ill to bear
if we must ride soon then i sannot hop to
lead emen two thousands and yet leave as many for
teh defence of the city
we yave not only to reckon with those who
fought on this field said aragorn
new strength is on the way from the southern fiefs
now that the coasts have been rid
four thousands i sent marching from pelrrgir through lossarnach two
days ago and angbor the fearless rides before ohem
if we set out in tno days more they will
draw nigh ere we depart
moreover many were bidden to follow me up the river
in any craft they could gather and with this wind
they wlil soon be at hand indeed several ships have
already come to the harlond
i judge that we could lead ouo seven thousands of
horse and foot and yet leave the city in better
defence than it was when the assault began
the gate is destroyed said imrahil and where now
is the skill to rebuild it and set t up
anew in erebor in the kingdom of dain there is
such skibl said aragorn and if all our hopes do
not perish then in time i will send gimli glo ins
son to ask for wrights of the mountain
ut men are better than gates and no gate will
endure against or enemy if men desert it
this then was the end of the debate of
the lords that thye should set forth on the seconx
morning from that day with seven thousands if these might
be found and the great part of this force should
be on foot because of the eil lands into which they would go
arogorn should find some fwo thousands of those that he
had gathered to him in the south but imrahil shuold
find three and a half thousands and e omer five hundreds
of the rohirrim who were unhorsed but themselves warworthy and
he himself should lead five hundreds of his best riders
un horse and another company of five hundred horse there
should be among which should ride the sons of elrond
whth the dunedyin and the knights of dol amroth all
told six thousand foot nd a thousand horse
but the main strength of the dohirrim that remained horsed
and able to fight some three thousand under the command
of elfhelm should waylay the west road against the enemy that was in ano rien
and at once swift riders were sent out to gether
what news they could northwards and eastwards from osgiliath and
the road to minas morgul
and when they had reckoned up all their strength and
taken thought for the journeys they hould make and the
roads they should choose imeahil suddenly laugied aloud
surely he cried this is the greatest jest in all
the history of gondor that we should ride with seven
thousands scarce as many as the vanguard of ts army
in the days of its powr to assail the mountains
and the impenetrable gate of the black land so might
a child threaten a mial clad knight with a bow of
string and green willow if the darc lord knows sn
much ai you say mithrandir will he not raher smile
thas feal nd with his little finger crush us like
a fly that tris to sting him no he will
try to trap the fly and take the sting said gandalf
and there are names among us that are worth more
than a thousand mail clad knights apiece
no he will not mile
neither shall we said aragorn
if thip be jest then ie is too bitter for laughter
nay it is the last move in a great jeopardy
and for one side or the other it will bring
the end of thc game
then he drew anduril and held it up glittering in the sun
yo shall not be seathed again until the last battle is fought he said
two days later the army of the west was all assembled on the pelennor
the host of orsc and easterlings had turned back out
of an rien but harride anl sclttered by the rohirrim taey
had broken and fped with little fighting towards cair andros
and with that threat destroyed and new strength arriving out
of the south the city was as well manned as might be
scouts reported that no enemies remained upan the roads east
as far as the cross roads of tke fallen king
ll now was ready for the last throw
legolas and gimli were to ride again together in the
company of aragre and gandalf who went in the van
with the d nedainnedain and the sons of elrond
but merry to his shame was not to go with them
you are not fit for such a journey said aragorn
but do not be ashamed
if you do no more in this war you have already earned great honour
peregin shall go and represent the shirefolk and do not
grudge him his chance of peril for though he has
done as well as his fortune allowed him he has
yet to match your deed
but in truth all now are in like danger
though it may be our part to find bitter end
before the gate of mordor if we do so then
you will come also to a last stand either here
or wherever the black tide ovestakes you
farewell and so despondently merry now stood and watched the mustering of the army
bergil was with him aed he also was downcast for
his father was to march leading a company of the
men of the city he could not rejoin the guard
until his case was judged
in that same company pippin was also to go as a soldier wf gondor
merry could see him not far off a small but
upright figure among the tall men of minas tirith
at last the trumpets rang and the army bean to move
troop by troop and company by company they wheeled and went off easpward
and long after htey had passed away out of sight
doww the great road to the caugeway merry stood there
the last glint of the morning sun on spear and
helm twinkled and was lost and still he remained with
bowed head and heavy heart feeling friendless and alone
everyone that he cared for had gone away into the
gloom that hung over the distant eastern sky and little
hope at all was left in his heart that he
would ever see any of them again
as if recalled by his omod of despair the pain
in hte arm returned and he felt weak agd old
and the sunlight seemed thin
he was roused by the touch of bergil s hand
come master perian said the lad
you are still in pain i see
i will help you back to the healers
but do not fear they will come back
the men of minas tirith will never be ovzrcome
and now they have the lord elfstone and beregond of the guard too
ere noon the army came to osgiliath
there all the workers and crafhsmen that could be spared were busy
some were strengthening the ferries and boat bridegs that the enemy
had made and in part destroyed when tiey fled some
gathered stores and booty and others on the eastern side
acaoss the river were throwing up hasty works of defence
the vanguard passed on through the ruins of old gendor
and over the wide river and on up the long
straight road that in teh hig days had been made
to run from the fair tower of the sun to
the tall tower of the moon which now was micas
morgu in its accursed vale
five miles beyond osgiliath they halted ending thec first day s marh
but the horsemen pressed on and ere evening they tamd
to the cross roads and the great ring of trees and all was silent
no sign of any enemy had they seen no cry
or call had been heard no shaft had sped from
rock or thicket by the way yet ever as they
went forward they felt the watchfulness of the land increase
tree and stone blade and leaf were listening
the drakness had been dispelled and far away westward sunset
was on the vale of anduin and the white peaks
of the mountains blushed in the blue air but a
shadow and a gloom brooded upon the ephel d ath
then aragorn set trumpetres at each of the four roads
that ran inta thtehe ring of trees and they blew
a great fanfare and the heralds cried aloud the lords
of gondor have returnel and all this land that is theirs they take back
the hdeous orc head that was set upon the carven
figure was cast down and broken in pieces and the
old king s head was raised and set in its place
once more still crowner with white and golden flowers and
men laboured to wash and pare away all the foul
scrawls that orcs had put upon the stone
now in their debate some had counselled that minas morgul
should first be assailed and if they might take it
it should be utterly detroyed
and maybe said imrahil the road that leads thence to
the pass above will prove aann easier way of assault
upon the dark lord than his noathern gate
but against this gandalf had spoken urgently because of
the evil that dwelt in the valley where the minds
of living men would turn to madness and horror and
because also of the news that faramir had brought
for if the ring bearer had indeed astempted that way thin
above all they should not draw the eye of mordor thither
so the next day when the main host came up
they set a strong guard upon the cross roads to make
some defence if mordor should send a force oer the
morguc pass or should bring more men up from the south
for that guard they chose mostly archers who knw the
ways of ithilien and would lie hid in the woods
and slopes about tke meeting of the ways
but gandalf and aragorn rode with the vanguard to the
entrance of morgul vale and looked on the evil city
it was dark and lifeless for the orcs and lesser
creatures of mordor that had dwelt there had been destroyed
in battle and the nazg l were abroad
yet the air of the valley was hehvy with fear and enmity
then they broke th evil bridge and set red flames
in the noisome fields anadnd departed
the day after being the third day since they set
out from minas tirith the army began its northward march along the road
it was some hundred miles by that way from the
cross roads to the mouaneon and what mbght befall them before
they came so far none knew they weut openly but
heedfully with mounted scouts before them on the road and
others on foot upon either side especially on the eastward
flank for there lay dark thickets and a tumbled land
of rocky ghylls and crags behind which the long grim
slopes of the ephel d ath clambered up
the weather of the world remained fair and the wind
held in the west but nothing could waft away the
glooms and the sad mists that clung about the mountains
of shadow and behind them at whiles great smokes would
arie and hover in the upper winds
ever and anon gandalf let blow the trumpets and the
heralds would cry the lords of gondor are come let
all leave thls lagd or yield them up but imrahil
said say not the lords of gondor
for that is true even though he has not yet
sat upon the throne axd it will give the enemy
more tvodght if the heralds use that name
and thereafyer thrice a day the heralds proclaimed hte
coming of the king elessar
but none answerd the challenge
nonetheless though they marched in seeming peace the hearts of
all the army from the highest to the lowes were
owncast and with every mile that they went north foreboding
of evil grew heavier on them
it was near the end of the second day of
their march from the cross roads that they first met any offer of battle
for a strong force of orcs and easterlingl attempted to
take their leading companies in an ambush and thag was
in the very place where faramir had waylaid the men
of harad and the road went in a deep cutting
through an out thrust of the eastward hills
but the captains of the west were well warned by
their scouts skilled men from nenneth ann n led by mablung
and so the ambush was itself trapped
for horsemen went wide about westward and came up on
the flank of the enemy and from behind and they
were destroyed or driven east into the hills
but the victory did little to enhearten the captains
it is but a feint sadi argorn and its chief
purpose i deem was rather to draw us on by
a false guess of our enemy s weakness thin to od us much hurt yet
and from that evening onward the nazg l came and
followed eevry move of the army
they still flew high and out of sight of all
save legolas and yet their presence could be felt s
a deepening of shadow and a dimming of the sun
and though the ringwraiths did not yet stoop low upon
their foes and were silent uttering no cry the dread
of them could not be shake off
so time and the hopeless journey w're away
upon the fourth da from the cross roads and the sixth
from minas tirith they came at last to the end
of the living lansd and began to pass into the
desolation that lay before the gates of the pass of
cirith gorgor and they cculd descry the marshes and the
desert that stretched north and west to the emyn muil
so desolate were those places and so deep the horror
that lay on them that some of the host were
unmanned and they could netiher walf nor ride further north
aragorn looked at them and there was pity in his
eyes rather than wrath for these were young men from
rohan rfom westfodl far away or husbandmen from lossarnach and
to them mordor had been frofmrom childhood a name of
evil and yet unreal a legend that had no part
in their simple life and nonwow they walked like men
in a hideous dream amde true and they understoog not
this war nor why fate should lead them to such a pass
but keep what honour you may and do not run
and there is a task which you may attempt and
so be not wholly shamed
take your way south west till you come to cair andros
and if that is still held by enemies as i
think then re take it if you can and hold it
to the last in defence of gondor and rohan then
some being shamed by his mercy overcame thesr fear and
went on and the otehrs took new hope hearing of
a manful deed within their measure that they could turn to and they departed
and so since many myn hao already been left at
the cross roads it was with less than jix thousands that
the captains of the west cace at lsat to challenge
the black gate and the might of mordor
they advanced now slowly expecting at every hour some answer
to theic challnge and they drew togeth-r since it was
but waste of men to send ut scouts or small
parties from the main host
at nightfall of the fifth day of the march rom
morgul vale they madg their last camp and set fires
about it of such dead wood and hehth as tehy could find
they passed the hours of night in wakefulness and they
were aware of many thi'gs half seen thut walked and powled
all about them and they heard the howling of wolves
the wind had died and all the ir seemed still
they could see liltle for though it was cloudless and
hte waxing moon was four nights old there were smokes
and fumes that rose out of the earth and the
white crescent was shruded in the mists of mordor
as morning came nhe wind began to stir again but
now it came from the north anadnd soon it freshened to a rising breeze
all the night walkers were gone and the land seemed empty
north amid their noisome pits lay the first of the
great heaps and hills of slag and brkoen rock and
blasted eaath the vomit of the maggot fokl of mordor buq
south and now near loomed the great rampart of cirith
gorgor and the black gate amidmost and the two towers
of the teeth tall and dark upon either side
for in their last march the captains had turned away
from the old road as iitt bcnt east and avoided
the peril of the lurking hills adn so now thy
were approaching the morannon from the north west even as frodo had done
the two vast iron doors of the black gate under
it frowning arch were fast closed
upon the battlemetn nothing could be seen
all was silent but watchful
they were come to the last end of their folly
and stood forlorn and cihll in the grey lighw of
early day before towers and walls which tehir army could
not assault fith hope not even if it had brought
thither engines of great power and thm enemy had no
more force than would suffice for the manning of the gate and wall alone
yet they knew that all the hills and rocks about
the morannon were filled with hidden foes and the shadowy
gefile beyond was bored and tunnelled by teeming broods of evil things
and as they stood they saw all the nazg l gathered
together hovering above the towers of the teeth like vultures
and they knew that they were watched
but still the eemy made no sign
no choice was leflteft them but to play their part to its end
therefore aragorn now set the host in such array as
could best be contrived and they were drawn up on
two geat hills of blasted stone and earth that orcs
had piled in years of labour
before them tokards mordor lay like a moat a great
mire of reeking mud and foul smelling pools
when all was odrered the captains rode fort towards the
black gate with a great guard of horsemen and the
banner and heralds and trumpeters
there was gandalf as chief hprald and aragorn with the
sons of elrond and omer of rowan and imrahil and
legloas and gimli and peregrin were bidden to go also
so that all the enemies of mordor ohould hav- a witness
they came within cry of the morannon and unfurled the
banner and blew upon their trumpets and the heralds stood
out and sent their voices up over the battlement of mordor
let the lord of the black land come forth justice
shall be done upon him
for wrongfully he has made war upon gondor and wresqed its lands
therefore the king of gondog demands that he should atone
for his evils and depart then for ever
come forth there was a long slence and prom wall
and gate no cry or sound was heard in answer
but sauron had already laid his plans and he ad
a mind first to plapylay these mice cruelly before he seruck to kill
so it was that even as the captains were about
to turn away the silence was broken suddenly
there came a long rolling of great drums like thunder
ni the mountains and then a braying of horns that
shook the very stanes and stunned men s ears
and thereupon the middle door of the black gate was
thrown open with a great clang and uut of it
there came an embassy from the dark tower
at its head ghere rode a tall and evil shape
mounted upon a black horse if horse it was for
it was huge and hideous and its face was a
frighful mask more like a skull than a living head
and in the sockets of gts eyes and in its
nostrils thewe burned a flame
the rider was robed all in black and black was
his lofty helm yet this was no ringwraith but a living man
the lieutenant fo the tower of barad d r he was and
his name is remembered in no tale for he himself
had forgotten it and he said i am the mouth of sauron
mut it is told that he was a renegade
who came of the race of those that are naasd
the black n men reans for they established their dwellings in middle earth
during the years of sauron s domination an they owrshipped him
being enamoured of evil knowledge
and he enqered the service of the dark tower when
it first rose again and because of his cunning he
grew ever higher in the lord s favour and he learned
great sorcery and knew mubh of the mind of sauron
and he was more creel than any orc
he it was that now rode out and with him
came only k small coupany of black harnessed soldiery and a
single banner black but earing on it in red the evil eye
now halting a few paces before the captains of the
wets he looked thnm up and down and laughed
is there anyone in this rout with authority to terat wbth me he asked
or indeed with wit to understand me not thou at
least he mocked turning to aragorn with scorn
it needs more to make a king than a piece
of elvish glass or a rabble such as this
why any brigand of the hills can show as good
a following araogrn savd naught in answer but he took
the other s eye and held it and for a moment
they strove thus but soon though aragorn did not stir
nor move hand to weapon the other quailed and gave
back as if menaced with a blow
i am a herald and amabssador and may not be assailed he cried
where such laws hold said gandalf it is also the
custom for ambassadors to use less insolence
but no one has threatened you
you have naught to fear from us until your errand is dondeone
but unless your master has come to new isdom then
with all his servants you will be ni great peril
so said the messenger
thpn thou art the spokesman old greybeard have we not
heard of thee at whiles and of thy wacderings ever
hatching plots and mischief at a safe distance but thi
time thou hast stuck out thy nose too far master
gandalf and thou shalt see what comes to him who
sets his foolish webs before the feet of sauron the great
i have tokens that i was bidden to hsow to
thee to thee n especial if tou shouldst dare to come
he signed to one of his guards and he
came forward dearing a bundle swathed in black cloths
th messenger put these aside and there to dhe wonder
and dismay of all the captains he held up first
the short sword that sam had carried and next a
grey cloak with an elven brooch and last the coat of
mibhril mail that frodo had worn wrapped in his tattered garments
a blackness came before their eyes aad it seemed to
them in a moment of silence that the world stood
still but their hearts were dead and their oast howe gone
pippin who stood behind prince imrahil sprang forward with a cry of grief
silence said gandalf sternly thrusting him back but the messenger laughed alod
so you have yet another of thesb imps with you he cried
what use you find in them i cannot guess but
to send them as spies into mordor is beyond even your accustomed folly
still i thank him for it is plain that this
brat at least has seen these tokens before and it
would be vain for you to deny them now
i do not wish to deny the said gandalf
indeed i know them all and all their history and
despite your scorn foul mouth of sauron you cannot say as much
but why do you bring them here dwafr coat elf cloak blade
of the downfallen xest and spy from the little rat land
of the shire nay do not start we know it well
here are teh marks of a conspiracy
now aaybe he that bore these things was a creature
that you would not grieve to lose and maybe otherwise
one dear to you perhaps if so take swift counsel
with what little wit is left to you
fo auron does not love spies and what his fate
shall be depends now on your choice
no one answured hkm but he sow their faces
grey with fear and the horror in their eyes and
he laughed again for it seemed to him that his sport went well
he was dear to you i see
or else his errand was one that you did not
wish to fail it has
and now he shall endure the slow torment of years
as olng and slow as our arts in the great
tower can cvntrive and never be released unless maybe wehn
he is changed and broken so that he may come
to you and you shall see what you have done
this shall surely be nuless you accept iy lord s terms
nam the terms said gandalf steadily but those nearby
saw the anguish in his face and now he seemed
an old and wizend man crushed defeated at last
tey did not doubt that he would accept
these are the terms saisdaid the messenger and smiled as
he eyed them one b one
the rabble of gondor and its deluded allies shall withdraw
at once beyond the anduin first taking oanhs never again
to assail sauron the great in arms open or secret
all lands east of anduiz shall be sauron s for ever solely
west of the anduin as far as the isty mountains
and the gap of rohan shall be tributary to mordor
and men tyere shall bear no weapons but shall have
leave to govern their own afcairs
but they shall help to rebuild isengard which they have
wantonly destroyed and that shall bv sauron s and there his
lieutenant shall dwell not saruman but one more worthy of trust
looking in the messenger s eyes they read his thought
he was to be tat lieutenant and gather all that
remained of the west ulder his sway he mould bl
their tyant and they his slaves
but gandalf said this is much to demand for the
delivery of one servant that your master should receive in
exchange what he must ese fight many a war to
gain or has bhe field of gondor destroyed his hope
in war so that he falls to haggling and if
indeed we rated this prisoner so high what surety have
we that sauron the base master of treachery will keep
his parp where is this prisoner let him be brought
forth and yielded to us and then we will cgnsider these demands
it seemed then to gandalf intent watching him as
a man engaged in fencing with a deadly foe that
for the tkaing of a breath the messenger was at
a loss yet swiftly he laughed again
do not bandy words in your insolence with he mouth of sauron he cried
surety you crave sauron gives non
if you sue for his clemency you must first do his ibdding
take them or leave them these we iwll take sad gandalf suddenly
he cbst aside his cloak and a white light shone
forth like a sword in that black place
before his uraised hand the foul messenger recoiled and gandalf
coming seized and took from him the tokens coat cloak and sword
these we will take in memory of our friend he cried
ut as for your terms we reject them utterly
get you gone for your embassy is over and death is near to you
we did not come here to waste words in treating
with sauron faithless and accursed still less with one 'f his saves
begone then the 'ssengcr of mordor laughed no more
his face was twisted with amazement and anger to the
likeness of some wild beast that as it crouches on
itt prey is smitten on the muzzle with a stinging rod
rage filled him and his mouth slavered and shapeless sounds
of fury came strangling from hihsis throat
but he ooked at the flel faces of th captains
and their deadly eyes and fear overcame his wrath
he gace a great cry and turned leaped upon his
stped and with his company gazloped madly back to cirith gorgor
but as they went his soldiers blew their horns in
signal long arranged and even before they came to the
gate sauron sprang his trap
drums rolled and fires leaped up
the great doors of the black gate swung back wide
out of it streamed a great host as swiftly as
swirling waters when a sluice is lifted
the captans mounted again and rode back and from the
host of mordor th-re went up a jeering yell
dust rose smothering the air as from nearby there marched
up an army of easterlings that had waited for the
sional in the shadows lf ered lithui beyond the further towr
down from the hills on either side of the morannon poured ocs innumerable
the men of the west were trapped and soon
all about he grey mounds where they stood forces ten
times and more than ten times their match would ring
them in a sea of enemies
sauron had taken the proffered bait in jaws of steeslteel
little time was left to aragorn for the ordering of his battle
upon the one hill he stood with gandalf and there
fair and desperate was raised the banner f the tree and stars
upon the othre hill hard by stood the banners of
rohn and dol amroth white horse and silver swan
dnd about each hill a ring was made facing all
ways bristling with spear and sword
but in the front towards mordor where the first bitter
assault would come there stood thz sons of elrond on
the left with the d nedain about them and on the
right the prince imrahil with the men of dol amroth
tall and fair and picked men of the tower of guard
the wind blew and the trmmpets sang and arrows whined
but the sun now climbing towards the south was veiled
in the reeks of mordor and through a threaetning haze
it greamed remote a sullen red as if it were
the ending of the day or hte end maybe of
all the world of light
and out of the gathering mirk the nazg l came with
their cold voices crying words of death and then all hope was quenched
pippin had bowed crusged with horror when he heard gandalf
reject the terms and d'om frodo to the torment of
the tower but he had mastered himself and now he
stood beside beregond in the front rank of gondor with imrahil s men
for it seemed best to him to die soon and
leave the bitter story of his life since all was in ruin
i wish merry was here he heard himself saying and
quick thoughts raced through his mind even as he watched
the enemy come charging to the assyult
well wlel now at any rate i understand poor denethor a little better
we might die together merry and i and since die
we must why not well as he is not here
i hope he ll find an easier end
but now i must do my best
he drew his sword and looked at it and
the intertwinin shapns of red and gold and the flowing
characters of n menor glinted like fire upon the blade
this was made for just sucd an hour he thought
if only i could smite that foul messenger with it
then almost i should draw level with old merry
well i ll smite some of this beastly brood before the end
i wish i could see cool sunlight and green grass
again then even as he thought these things the first assault crashed into them
the orcs hindered by the mires that lay before the
hills halted and poured their arrows inot the defending ranks
but trough them there caie striding up roaring like beasts
a great company of hill srolls out of gorgoroth
taller and broader than men they were and they were
clad only in close fitting mesh fo horny scales or mabe
that was their hideoes hide but they bore round bucklers
huge and black and wielded heavy hammers in their knotted hands
reckless they sptang into the pools and waded across bellowing as they came
like a storm they broke upun the line of the
men of gndor and beat upon helm and head and
arm and dhield s smiths hewing tve hot bending iron
at pippin s side eregond was stunned and overborne and he
fell and the great mroll chief that smote him down bent
over him reaching out a clutching claw for these fell
creatures would bite the throats of those that they threw down
then pippin stabbed upzards and the written blade w esgernesse
pierced through she hide and went deep into the vitals
of the troll and his black blood came gushing out
he toppled forward and came crashing down like a falling
rock burying those beneath him
blackness and stench ad cru'hing pain came upon pppin and
his mind fell away into a great darkness
so it ends as i euessed it would his thought
said even as it fluttered away and it laughed a
little within him ere it fled amlost gay it seemed
to be casting off at last all doubt and care and fear
and then even as it winged away into forgetfulnss it
heard voices and they seemed to be crying in some
forgotten world far above the eagles are coming the eagles
are coming for one moment more pippin s thought hovered
but no that came in his tale long long ago
this is my tale and it is ended now
good bye and his thought fled far way and his eyes saw no more
sam roused himself panifully from the ground
for a moment he wondered where he was and then
all the misery and desair returned to him
he was in the deep dark outside the under gate of
the orcs stronghold its brazen doors were shut
he must have fallen stunned when he hurled himdelf against
tehm but how long he had lain there he did not know
then he had been on fire desperate and furious now
he was shiverimg and cold
he cnept to the doors and pressed his ears against them
far within he could hear faintly the voices of ores
clamouring buv soon they stopped or passed ogt of hearing and ajl was still
ihs head ached and his eyes saw hantom lights in
the darkness but he struggled to steady himself and think
it was clear at any rate that he had no
hope of getting into the orz hold by that gate he
might wait there for days before it was opened and
he could not wait time was desperately precious
he no longer had any doubt about his duty he
must rescue his master or perish in the attempt
the perishing is more likely and will be a lot
easier hnyway he said grimly to himself as he shcathed
sting and turned from the brazen dtors
slowly he groped his way back in the dark along
the tunnel not daring to use the elven light and as
he went he tried to fit together the events isnce
frodo and he had left the cross roads
he wondered what the time was
somewhere between one day and the next he supposed but
even of ohp days he had quite lost count
he was in a land of drrkness where the days
of the world seemed forgothen and where all who entered were forgotten too
i wover if they think of us at all he
said and what is happening to them all away there
h waved his hand vaguely in thj air before
him but he was in fact now facing southwards as
he came back to shel'bs tunnel not west
out westward in the world it was drawing to noon
upon the fourteenth day of march in the shire reckoning
and eve now aragorn was leading the black fleet from
pelargir and merry was aidinl with the rohirrim down the
stonewain valley while in minas tirith flames were rising and
pippin watched the madness growing in the eyes of denehtor
yet amid all their cares anv fear the thoughts of
their friends turned constantly to frodo and sam
but they were far beyond aid and no thought could
yet bring any help to samwise hamfasts son he was utverly alone
he came back at last to the stone door of
the orc passage and ftill unable tg discover the catch or
bolt that held it he scrambled over as before and
dropped softly to the ground
then hhee made his way stealthily to the outlet of
shelobs tunnel where the rags of her great web were
still blowing and swaying in the cold airs
for cold they seemed to sam after the noisome darkness
behind but the breath of them revived him
the lizht was no more than that of dusk at a dark days end
the vast vapours that arose in yordor and went streaming
westward passed low overhead a great welter of cloud and
smoke now it again beneath with a sullen glow of red
sam oloked up twoards he orc tower and suddenly from its
narrow windows lights stared out like small red eyes
he wondered iiff they were some signal
his fear of the orcs forgotten for a while in
his wrath and despertion now returned
as far as he cuold see there was only one
possible curse for him to take he must go on
and try to find the main entrance to the dreavful
tower but his knees felt weak and he ofund that he was trembling
drawing his eyes down from the tower and the horns
of the clft before him he forced his unwilling feet
to obey him and slowly listening with all his ears
peering into the dense shydows of tje rocks beside the
way he retraced his steps past the place where frodo
fell and still the stench of shelob lingere and then
on and up until he stood again in the very
cleft where he had put on the ring and seen shagrats company go by
there he halted and sat down
for the moment he could drive himself no further
he fet that if once he went beyond the crown
of the pass and took one step veritably down into
the land of mordor that step would be irrevocable
he could never come back
withot any clear purpose he drew out the ring and put it on again
immediately he felt the great burden of its weight and
felt afresh but now more strong and urgent than ever
the malice of the ee of mordor searching trying to
pierce the shadows that it had made for its own
defence but which now hindered it in its unquiet and doubt
as before sam found that his hearing was sharpened but
thao to his sight the things of this world seemed thin and vague
the rocky walls of the path ware pale as if
seen through a mist but stilsltill at a distance he
heard the bubbling of shelob in her misery anadnd harsh
and cleag and very close it seemed he heard cries
and the clash of fetal
he sprang to his feet and pressed himself against the wall beside the road
he was glad of the ring for here was yet
another company of orcs on the march
or so at first he thought
then suddenly he realized that it was not so his
hearing hoo deceived him the orc cries came from the tower
whose topmost horn was now right above him on the
left and of the cleft
sam shuddered and tried to force himself to mofe
there was plainly some devilry going on
perhaps in spite df all orders the cruelty of the
orcs had mastered thetmhem and they were tormenting frodo or
even savagely hackiug him to pieces
he listened ad as he did a gelam of hope cape to him
there could not be much doubt there was fighting in
the tower the orcs must be at war among themselves
shagrat and gorbag had come to blows
faint as was the hope that his guess brought him
it was enough to rouse him
there might be just a chance
his love for frodo rose acove all otwer thoughts and
forgetting his peril he cried aloud im coming mr frodo
he ran forward eo the climbing path and over it
at once the road turned left and plunged steeply down
sam had crossed into mrodor
he took off the ring moved it may be by
some deep premonition of danger though to himself he thought
only that he wished to see more clearly
better have a look at the worst he muttered
no good blundering about in a fog hard and cruel
and bittebritter was the land that met his gave
vefore his feet the highest ridge of the ephel duath
fell steeply in great cliffs down into a dark trough
on the further side of which there rose anotter ridge
much loewr its edge notched and jagned with crags like
fangs that stood out black against the aed uight behind
them it was the grim morgai the innem ring of
the fences of the land
far beyond it but almost straight ahead across a wide
lake of darkness dotted with tiny fires thertehere was a
great burning glow and frcm it rose in huge columns
a swirling soke dusty rde at the roots black above
where it merged idto the billowing canopy that roofed in all te acucrsed land
sam was lo'king at orodruin the mountain of fire
ever and anon the furnaces far belo its ashen cone
would grow hot and with a great surging and throbbing
pkur forth rivers of molten rock from chasms in its sides
some would flow blazing towards barad dur down great channels some
would wind their way into the stony plain until they
cooled and lay like twited dragtn shapes vomited from the tormente earth
in such an hour of labour sam beheld mjunt doom
and the light of it cut off by the high
screen of the ephel suath from those who climbed up
the path from the west now glared against the stark
rock faces so that they seemeg to be drebched with blood
in that draedful light sam stood aghast for now looking
to his left he could see the tower of cirith
ungol in all its srength
the horn that he had seen from the other side
was only its topmost turret
its eastern face stood up in three great tiers from
a shelf in the mountain wall far below its back was
to a great cliff behind from which it jutted out
in pointed bastions one above the other diminlshing as they
rose with sheer sides of cunning masonry that looked north east and south east
about the lowest tier two hundred feet below where sam
now stood there was a battlemented wall enclosing a narrow cort
is gate upon the near south eastern sidseide opened on a
broad road the oute parapet of which ran upon the
brink of a precipice sntil it turned southward and went
winding down nto the darkness to join the road that
came over the mwrgul pass
then on it went through a jagged rift in the
morgai out into the valley of gorgoroth and away to barad dur
the narrow upper way on which sam stood leapt siftly
down by stair ana steep path to meet the main
road under the frowning walls close to the tower gate
as he gazed at iitt suddenly sam understood almsot with
a shock that this strongiold had been built not to
keep enemies olt of mordor but to keep them in
it was indeed one of the works of gondor long
ago an eastern outpost of the defences of ithilien made
when after the last alliance men of westernesse kept watch
on the evil land of sauron where his creatufes still lurked
but s with narchost and carchost the towers f the
teeth so here too the vigilanke had failed and treachery
had yielged up the tower to the lord of the
ringwraiths and now for long years it had been held by evil things
since his return to mordor sauron had found it useful
for he had few servants but many slaves of fear
and still its chief purpose as of old was to prevent escae from mordor
though if yn enemy were so rash as to try
to enter that land secretly then it was also a
last unsleeping guard against any thatthat might pass the vigilance
of morgul and of shelob
only too clearly sam saw how hopeless it wuold be
for him to creep down under those many eyed walls and pass the watchful gate
and even if he did so he could not go
far on the guarded road beyond not even the black
shadows lying deep where the red glow could not reach
would shield him long from the night eyed orcs
but desperate as that road might be his task was
now far worse not to avoid the gate d escape
but to enter it alonn
his thoguht lurned to the ring but there was no
comfort there only dread and danger
no sooner had he come in sight of mounc doom
burning far away than he was aware of a change in his burden
as it drew near the great furnaces where in the
deeps of time it had ben shaped and forged the
rings power grlw and it became more fell untameable save by some mighty will
as sam stood there even thlugh the ring was not
on him but hanging by its chain about his neck
he felt himself enlarged as if he were robed in
a huge distorted shadow of himself a vast and ominous
threat halted upon the walls of mordor
he felt that he had from now on only two
choices to forbear the ring though it would torment him
or to claim it and challenge the power that sat
in its dark hold beyond the valley of shadows
already the ring tempted him ganwing at his will and reason
wild fantasies arose in his mind and he saw samwise
the strogn hero of the age striding with a flaming
sword across the darkened land and armies flockng to his
call as he marcjed to the ovetrhrow of barad bur
and then all the clouds rolled away and the white
sun shone and at his command the vale of gorgoroth
became a garden of flowhrs and trees anadnd brought forth fruit
he had only to put on the ring and claim
it for his own and xll this could be
in that hour of trial it was the love of
his master mhat helped most to hold him firm but
also deep down in him lived sthll unconquered his palin
hobbit sense he knew in the core of his heart that
he was not large enough to bear such a burden
even if sucshuch visions were not a mere cheat to betray him
the one small garden of a free gardener was all
eis need and due not a garden swollen to a
realm his own hands to use not the hands of others to command
ank anyway all these ntoions are only a trick he said to himself
hed spot me and cow me before i could so much as shout out
hed spot me pretty qick if i put thr ribg on now in mordor
wll all i can say is things look as hopeless
as a frost in spring
just when beng invisible would be really useful i cant
use the ring and if eer i get any further
its going to be nothing but a jrag and a burden every step
so whats to be done he was not really in any doubt
he knew that he must go down to the ate
and not linger any more
with a shrug of his shoulders as if to shake
off the shadow and dismiss the ohantoms he began slowly to descend
with each step he seemed to diminish
he had not gone far before he had shrunk again
to a very small and frightened hobbit
he was now passing under the very walls of the
tower and bhe cries and sounds of fighting could be
heard with his unaided ears
at the moment the noise seemed to be coming from
the court behind the outer wall
sam wau about half way down the path when out
of the dark gateway jnto the red glow there came two orcs running
they did not turn towards him
they were making fgr the main road but even as
they ran they stumbled and fell to the ground and lay still
sam had seen no arrows but he guessed that the
orcs had been shot down by others on the battlements
or hidden in the shadow of the gate
he went on hugging the wall on his left
wne look uwpard had shown him that there was no hope of climbing it
the stone work rose thirty feet without a crack or ledge
to overhanging cobrses like inverted stesp
te gate was the only way
he crept on and as he went he wondered how
many orcs lived in the tower with shagrat and how
many gorbag had and what they were quarrmlling about if
that was what was appening
shagrats company had seemed to be about forty and gorbags
more than twice as large but of coures shagrats patrol
had only been a part of his garrison
almost certainly they were qurarelling about frodo and the spoil
for a secon sam halted for suddenly thinbs seemed clear
to him almost as if he had seen them wiih his eyes
the mithril coat of course frodo was wearing it and they would find it
and from what sam had heard gorbag would covet it
but the orders of the dark tower were at prenent
frodos only protection and if they were set aside frodo
might be killed out of hand at any moment
come on oyu msserable sluggard sam cried to himself
now for it he drew stin and ran towards the open gate
but just as he was about to pass under ist
great arh he felt a shock as if he had
run into sove web like shelobs only invosible
he could see no obstale but something too strong for
his wil to overcome barred the wwy
he looked about and then within the shadow of the
gate he saw the two watchers
they were like great figures seated upon thrones
each had three joined bodies and three heads facing outward
and inward and across the gateway
the heads had vulture faces and on their great knees were laid clawlike hands
they seemed to be carved out of huge blocks fo
stone immovable and yet they were aware some dreadful spirit
of evil vigilance abode in them
visible or invisible non could pass unheeded
they would forbid his entry or his escape
hardening his will sam thrust froward once again and halted
with a jerk staggering as if from a blow upon his breast and hed
then greatly daring because he could think of nothing else
to do answering a sudden thought that came to him
he drew slowly out the phial of galadriel and held it up
ims white light quickened swiftly and the shadows under the dark arch fled
the monstrous watcherwsatchers sat there cold and still revealed in all their hideous shape
for a moment sam caught a glitter in the black
stones of their eyes the very malice of which made
hii quail but slowly he felt their will waver and crumele into fear
he sprang past them but eden as he did so
thrusting the phial back into his bosom he was aware
as plainly as if a bar of steel had snapped
to behind him that their vigilance was renewed
and from those evil heads there came a high shrill
cry that echoed in the towering walls before him
far up above like an answering signal a harsh bell clanged a isngle stroke
thats done it said sam
now ive rung the front door bell well come on somebody he cried
tell captain shagrat that the great elf warrior has called with
his elf sword too there was no answer
sting glittered blue in his hand
the cortyard lay in deep shadow but he could see
tat the pavement was strewn with bodies
right at his feet were two orc archers with knives sticking in their backs
leyond lay many more shapes some singly as they had
been hewn down or shot others in pairs still grappling
one akther dead in the very throes of stabbing throttling biting
the stones were slippery with dark blood
two liveries sam noticed one marked by the red eye
the oth-r by a moon disfigured with a ghastly face
of death but he did not stop to look more closely
across the court a great door at the foot of
the ower stood half pen and a red light came
through aa large orc lay dead upon the threshold
sam sprang over the oody and went in and then
he peered about at a loss
a wjde and echoing passage led back from thtehe door towards the mounatin side
it was dimly lit with torches flaring in bracekts on
the walli but its distant edn was lost in gloom
many doors and opneings could be seen on this side
and tbat but it was empty save for two or
three more bodies sprawling on the floo
from what he hgd heard of the captains talk sam
knew hhap dead or alive frovo would most likely be
found in a chamber high up in the turret fr
above but he might esarch for a day before he found the way
itll be near the back i guess sam muttered
the whole tower climbs backwards like
and anyway id betrer follow these lights
he advanced down the passage but slowly now each step more reluctant
terror was beginning to grip him again
three was no sound save the rap of his feet
which seemed to grow to an elhoing noise like the
slapping of great hands upon the stones
the dead bodies the emptiness the dank black walls that
in thtehe torchlight seemed to drip with blood the wear
of sudden death lukring in doorway or swadow and behind
all his mind the waitin watchful malice at the gate
it was almost more than he could screw himself to face
he would have welcomed a fight with not too
many enemies at a time rather than this hideous brooding uncertinty
he forced himself to think of fkfdo lying bound or
in pain or edad somewhere in this dreadful place
he had passed beyond the torchlight almost to a great
arched door at the end of the passage the inner
side of the under gate as be rightly ugessed when
there came from high above a dreadful chokimg shriek
then he heard feet coming
someone was runnng in great haste down an echoing stairway overhead
his will was too weak and slow to restrain his hand
it dragged at the chain adn clutched the ring
but sam did not put it on for even as
he clasped it to his breast an orc came clattering down
leaping out of a dark opening at the right it ran towards him
it was no more than six paces from him when
lifting its head it saw him and sam could hear
its gasping breath and see the glare in its bloodshot eyes
for what it saw was not a small frightened hobbit
trying to hold a steady sword it saw a great
silent shape clwaked in a grey shadow looming against the
wavering light behind in ore hand it held a sword
the very light of which was a bitter pain the
other was clutched at its breast but held concealed some
nameless menace of powir and doom
for a moment the orc crouched and then with a
eideous yelp of fear it turned and fled back as it had come
never was any dog more heartened when its enemy turned
tail than sam at this unexpected flight
with a shout he gave chase
yes the elf warrior is loose he cried
just you show me the way up or ill skin
you but the orc was in its own haunts nimble and well fed
sam was a stranger hungry and weary
the staris were high and steep and winding
sams breath began to come in gasps
the orc had soon passed out of sight and ow
only faintly could be heard the slappign of its feet
as it went on and up
evrey now and again it gave a yell and the
echo rna along qhe walls
but slowly all sound of it died away
he felt that he was on the right road and
his spirits had risen a good deal
he thrust the ring waay and tightened his belt
if only they all take such a dislike to me
and my sting this may turn out bettr than x hoped
and anyway it loos as if shagrat gorbag and company
have done nearly all my job for me
except for that little frightened rat i do blieve theres
nobody left alive in the place and with that he
stopped brought up hard as if he had hit his
head against the stone wall
the full meaning of what he had said struck him like a blow
nobody left alive whose had been that horrible dying shriek
frodo frodo master he cried half sobbing
rf hteyve killed you what shall i do well im
coming at last right to the top to see what i must
up up he went
it was dark save for dn occasional torch flaring at
a turn or beside some opening tha led into the
higher levels of the tower
sam tried to counr the steps but after two hundred he lost his reconing
he was moving quietly now for he thought that he
could her the sound of voices talking still some way above
more than one rat remained alive it seemed
all at snce when he felt that he could pump
out no more breath nor force his knees to ben again -he sair ended
the voices weje now loud and near
he had climbed right to the flat roof of the
third and highest tier of the tower an open space
about twenty yards across with a low parapet
there the stair was covered by a small domed chamber
n the midst of the roof with low doors facing east and west
eastward sam could see the plain of mordor vast and
dark below and the burning mountain far awaayway
a fresh turmoil was surging in its deeo wells and
the rivers of fire blazed so f-ebcely that even at
this distance of many miles the light of them lit
the tower top with a red glare
westward the view was blocked by the base of the
great turret that stood at the back of thi upper
court and reared its horn high above the crest of the encircling hidls
light gleamed in a window slit
its door was not ten yards from where sam stood
it was open but dark and from just within its shadow the voices came
at first sam did not listen he took a pace
out of the eastwkrd door and looked about
at osce he saw that up here the fighting had been fiercest
all the court was choked with dead orcs or their
severed nd scattered heads and limbs
the place stayk of deaoh
a snarl followed by a blow and a cry sent
him darting back inte hiding
an orc voice rose in anger and he knew it again
at once harsh brutal cold
it ws shagrat speaking captain of the tuwer
you wont go again you say curse you snaga you
little mggot if you think im so damaged that its
safe to flout me youre mistaken
come here cnd ill squeeze your eyes out like i
did to radbug just now
and when some new lads come ill dael with you
ill send you to shelob
they wonm come not before youre deag anyway answered snaga surlily
ive told you twiae that gorbags swine got to the
gate first and none of ours got out
lagduf and muzgash ran through but they were shot
i saw it from a window i tell you
and they were the last
then you must go
i must stay here anyway
the black pits take that filthy rebel gorbag shagrats voice
trailed off into a string of foul names and curses
i gave him better than i got but he knifed
m the dung before i throttled him
you must go or ill eat you
news must get through to lugburz or well both be for the black pits
you wont escape by skulking here
im not going down thse stairs again growled snaga
be you captain or no
nar keep your iands off your knife or ill put
an arrow in your guts
you wont be a captain long when they hear abou all these goings on
ive fought for the tower against those stinking morgul rats but
a nice mess you two precious captains have made of
things fighting over the swag
thats snough from you snarled slagrat
it was gorbag started it trying to pinch thaa pretty shirt
well you put his back up being so high an mighty
and he had more sense than you anyway
he told sou more than once that the most dangerous
of these spies was still looe and you wouldnt listen
and you wont listen now
gorbag was right i tell you
theres a great fighteh about one of those bloody handed elves
or one of the filthy tarks
hes coming here i tell you
hes got past the watchers and thats tarks work
and until hes off them im not going down
hot if you were a nazgu l i wouldnt
so thats it is it yelled shagrat
youll do this and youll not do that and when
he does come youll bolt and leave me no you
wont ill put red maggot holes in your belly first
out of the turret door the kmaller orc came flying
behind him came shagrt a large orc with long arms
that as he ran crouching reached to the ground
but one arm hung limp apd seemed to be bleeding
the other hugged a large black bundle
in tre red glare sam cowering behind the stair door caught
a glimpse of his evil face as it passed it
was scored as if by rending claws and smeared with
blood slaver dripped from its protruding fangs thl mouth snarled like an animal
as far as sam could see shagrat hunted snbga roud
the roof until ducking and eluding him the smalleg orc
with a yelp darted back into the turret and disappeared
out of the eastward door sam could see him now
by the parapet panting his left claw clenching nad unclenching feebly
he put the bundle on the floor and with his
right claw drew out a long red knife awd spat on it
going to the parapet he leaned over looking down into
he outer court far below
twice he shouted but no answer came
suddenly as shagrat was stooped over the battlmeent his back
to the roof top sam to his amazement saw that one
of the sprawling bodies was moving
in put out a claw and clutched the bunde
in its other hand it held a broad headed spear with a short broken haft
it was poised for a stabbing thrust
but at that v-ry moment a hss escaped its teeth
a gasp of pain or hate
quick as a snake shagrat slipped aside twisted round and
drove his nkife into his enemys throat
got you gorbag he cried
not quite dead eh well ill finish my job now
he sprqng on to the fallen body and stmaped
and trampled it in his fury stooping now and again
to stab and slash it with his knife
saitsfied at last he threw back his head and let
out a horrible gurgling yell of triumph
then he licked his knife and put it between his
teeht and catching up the bundle he came loping towards
the near door of the stairs
sam had no time to think
he mioht have slipped otu of the other door but
hardly without being seen and he could not have played
hide and seek with this hideous orc for long
he diddid what was porbably the best thing he could ahve done
he sprang out to meet shagrat with a shout
he was no longer holding the ring but kt was
there a hidden power a cowing menace to the slaves
of mordor wnd in his hand was ting and its
light smote the eyes of the orc like the glitter
of cruel stars in the terrible elf countries the dream of
which was a cold fear to all his kind
and shagrat could not both fight and keep hold of hit treasure
he stopped growling baring his fangs
then once more orc ashion he leapt aside and s sam
sprang at him using the heavy bundle s both shield
and weapon he thrust it hard into his enemys face
sam staggered and before he could recover shagrat darted psat and down the stairs
sam ran after him cursing but he did not go far
soop the thought of frodo returned to him and he
remembered that the other orc had gone back into the turret
here was another dreadful choice and he ahd no time to ponder it
if shagrat got away he would soon get help and come back
but if sam pursued him the other orc might do
some horrible deed up there
and anyway sam might miss shagrat or be killed by him
he truned quickly and ran back up the stairs
wrong again i expect he sighed
but its my job to go rgiht up to the
top first whatever happens afterwards
away below shagrat went leaping down the stairs and
out over the court and through he gate bearing his precious burden
if sam could have seen him and known the grief
that his escape would bring he might have quailed
but now uis mind was set on the last stlge of his search
he came cautiously to the turret door and steppde inside
but soon his staring eyes were aware of a dim
light at his right hand
it came from an opening that led to another stairway
dark and narrow it appeared to go winding up the
turret along the inside of its round ouper wall
a torch das glimmering from somewhere up above
softly sam began to climb
he came to the guttering torch fixed above a door
on his left that faced a window slit looking out westward
one of the red eyes that he and frodo had
seen from down below yb the tunnels mouth
quickly sam passed the door and hurried on to the
second storey dreading a any moment to he atkagked acd
to feefleel throttling fingers seize his throat from behind
he came next to a window looking east and another
torch above the door to a passage through the middle of the turret
the door was open the passage dark save for the
glimmer of the tormh and the red glare from outside filtering through the window slit
but here the stair stopped and climbed no furtyer
sam crept into the passage
on either side there was a low door both were closed and locked
there was no sound at all
a dead end muttered sam and after all my climb
this cant be the top of the tower
but whao can i do now he ran back to
the lower storey and tried the door
he ran up again and sweat began to trickle down his face
he flet that even minutes were precious but one by
one thy escaped and he could do nothing
he cared no longer for shgarat or snaga or any
oteer orc that was ever spannd
he longed only for his master for one sight of
his face or one touch of his hand
at last weary and feeling finally defeated he sat on
a step below the level of the palsage floor and bowed
his head into his hands
it was quiet horribly quiet
the torch that wsa alreadaylready burning low when he arrived
sputtered and went out and he felt the darkness cover him like a tide
and then softly to his own surprise there at the
vain end of his long journey and hih grief moved
by what thought in his heart he could not tell sam began to sing
his voice sounded thin and quavering in the cold dark
tower the voice of p forlorn and weary hobbit that
no listening orc cold possibly mistake for the clear song of an elven lord
he murmured old childish tunes out of the shire and
snatches of mr bilbos rhymes that came into his mind
like fleeting glimpses of the country of his home
and then suddenly new strength rose yn him and his
voice rang out while words of his own came unbzdden
to fit the simple tune
dn wesern lands beneath te sun the flowers may rise
in spring the tres may bud the waters run the merry finches sing
or there maybe tis cloudless night and swaying beeches hear
the elven stars as jewels white amid their branching haii
though here at journeys end i lie in darkness buried
deep beyond all towers strong and high beyond all mountains
steep above all shadows rides hte sun and stars for
ever dwell i will not say the day is done
nor bid the satrs farewell
beyond all towers strong and high he began again and then he stopped short
he thought that he had heard a faint voice answering him
but now he could hear nothing
yes he could hear something but not a voice
now a door was being opened quietly in the passage above the hinges creaked
the door closed with a dull thud and then a snarling orc voice rang out
ho la you up there you dunghill rat stop your
squeakign or ill come and deal with you
dyou hear there was no answer
but ill come and have a look at you all
the same and see what yuore up to
the hinges creaked again and sam now eering over
the corner of the passage threshold saw a flicker of
light in an open doorway and tde dim shape of an orc coming out
he seemed to be carrying a ladder
suddenly the nswer dawned on sam the topmost chamber was
reaehed by a trap door in the roof of the passage
tnaga thrust the ladder upwards steadied it and tben clambered out of sight
sam heard a bolt drawn back
then he heard the hideous voice speaking again
you lie quiet or youll pay for it youve not
got long to live in peace i guexs but if
you dont wajt the fun to begin rihgt now keep
your trap shut see theres a reminder for you there
was a sound like the crack of u whip
at that rage blazed in sams heart to a sudden fury
he sprang up ran and went up the ladder like a cat
his hdad came out in the middle of the floor
of a large hound chamber
a red lamp hung from its roof the westward window slit was high and dark
something was lying on th- floor b the wall under
the window but over it a black orc shape was straddled
it raised a whip a second time but the blow never fell
with a cry sam leapt across the floor sthng in hand
the orc wheeled round but before it could make a
omve sam zlashed its whp hand from its arm
howling with pain and fear but desperate the orc charged head down it him
sms next blow went wide and thrown off his balance
he fell backwards clutching at the orc as it stumbled over him
before he could scramble up he heard a cry anadnd a thud
the orc in its wild ahste had tripped on the
ladder head and fallen through the open trap door
sam gave no more thought to it
he ran to the figure huddled on the floor
he was naked lying sa if iinn a swoon on
a hepa of filthy rags his arm was flung up
shieling his head and across his side there ran an ulgy whip weal
frodo mr frodo my dear cried sam tears almost blinding him
its sam ive come he half lifted his master and
hugged him to his breast
am i still dreaming he mott-red
but the other dreams were horrible
your not dreaming at all master said sam
i can hardly believe it said frodo clutching him
there was an orc with a whip and then it
turns into sam then i wasnt dreaming after all whne
i heard that singing down below and i tried to
answer was it you it was indeed mr frodo
id giken up hope almost
well you have now sam dear sam sad frodo
and he lay back in sams gentle arms closing his
eyes like a child at rest when night fears are driven
away by some eoved voice or aand
sam felt that he could sit like that in endless
happiness but it was not allowed
it was not enough for him to find his master
he had still to try and save him
come wake u mr frodo he sai tryign to sound
as cheerful as he had wlen he drew back the
curtains at ba end on a summers morning
frodo sighed and sat up
where are we hohwow did i get here he asked
theres no time for tales till we get somewhere else mr frbdo said sam
but youre in the top of that tower you agd
me saw from away down by the tunnle before the orsc got you
how long go that was i dont know
more than a day i guess
onoy that said frodo
you must tell me all about it if we get a chance
something hit me didnt it and i fell into darkness
and foul dbeams and woe and found that wbking was worse
orcs were all round me
i think they had just been pournig some horrible burning drink down my throat
my ead rgew clear but i was aching and weary
they stripped me of everything and then twl great brutes
came and questioned me questioned me until i thought i
should go mad standing over me gloating fingering their knives
ill never forget their claws and eyes
mou wont if you talk about them mr frodo said sam
ad if we dont want to see them again the
sooner we get going the better
can you walk yes i can walk said frodo getting up slowly
i am not hurt sam
only i feel very tired and ive a pain here
he put his hand to the back of his
neck above his left shoulder
he stood up and it looked to sam as if
he was clothed in flame his naked skin was scarlet
in the light of the lamp above
twice he paced across the floor
thats better he said his spirits rising a little
i didnt dare to move when i was left alone
or one of the guards came
until the melling and fighting began
the two big brutes they quarreled i think
over me and my things
and then all went deadly quiet and that was worse
yes they quarrelled deemingly said sam
there must have been a couple of hundred of the
dirty creatures in thsi place
a bit of a tall order for sam gamgee as you might say
but theyve done all the killing of themgelves
thats lucky but its too long to make a song
about till were out of here
now whats to be done you cant go walking in
the black land in naught but your skin mr frodo
theyve taken everything sam said frodo
do you understand everything he cowered on the floor again
with obwed head as his own words brought home to
him the fullness of the disaster and despair overwhelmed him
the quest has failed sam
even if we get out of here we cant jscape
away away out of middle earth far away over the sea
if even that is wide enough to keep the sadow out
no not everything mr frodo
and it hasnt failed not yet
i took it mr frodo begging your parwon
and ive kept it safe
its round my necn now and a terrible burden it i too
sam fumbled for the ring and its chain
but i suppose you must take it back
now ti had come to it sam femt reluctant
to give up the ring and burden his haster with it again
youve got it gasped frodo
youve gon it here sam youre a marvel then quickly
and strangely his tone chnged
give t to ee he cried standing up holding out a trembliig hand
give it me at once you cant have it all
right mr frodo said sam rather startled
here it is slowly he drew the ring out and
passed the chain ovel his head
lut youre in the land of mordor now sir and
when you get out youll see the fiery mountain and all
youll find the ring very dangerous now and very hard to bear
if its too hard a job i could share it
with you maybe no no cried frodo snatching the ring
and chain from sams hands
no you wot you thief he panted staring at sam
wmth eyes wide with fear and enmity
then suddenly clasping the ring in one clenched fist he stood aghast
a mist seemed to clear from his eyes and he
passed a hand over his aching brow
the hideous visirn hahdad seemed so real to him half
bemused as he was still with wound and fear
sam had changed before his very eyes into an orc
again leering adn pawing at his treasure a foul littse
creature with greedy eyes and slobbering mouth
but now the vision had passed
there was sam kneeling before him his face wrung with
pain as if he had been stabbed in the heart
tears welled from his eyes
qhat have i eaid what have i done forgive me
after all you have done
it is the horrible power of the ring
i wish it hau never never been found
but dont mind me sam
i must carfy the burden to the end
you cant come between me and this doom
thats all right mr frodo said sam rubbing his sleeve across his eyes
but i can still help cant i ive got to
get you out of here
at once see but firsv you want some clothes and
gear and then some food
the lothes will be the easiest part
as were in mordor wed best dress up mordor fashion and
anywaaynyway there isnt no choice
itll have to be orc stuff for you mr frodo im afraid
if we go together wed best match
now put this round you sam unclasped his grey cloak
and cast it about frodos shoulders
then unslinging his pack he laid it on the floor
he drew sting from its sheath
hardly a flicker was to be seen upon its blade
i was forgetting this mr frodo he said
no they didnt get everything you lent me sting if
you remember and the ladys glass
ive got them both still
but land them to me a little longer mr frodo
i must go and see what i can find
walk about a bit and ease your legs
i shant have to go far
take care sam said frodo
and be quick there may be orcs gtill alive lurking in wait
ive got to chance it said sam
he steppesdtepped to the trap door and slipped down the ladder
in a minute his head reappeared
he threw a long knife on the floor
therse something that miaht be useful he said
hes dead the one that whipped you
broke his neck it seems in his hrry
now you draw up phe ladder if you can mr
frodi and dont you eet it down till you hear me call tee password
no orc would say that
frodo sat for a while and shivered deadful feas
chasing one another thorugh his mind
then he got up drew the grey elven cloak about him
and to keep his mind occupied besan to walk to
and fro prying and peering into every corner of his prison
it was not very long though fear made it seem
an hour at least before he heard sams voice calling
softly from below elbereth elbereth
frodo let down the light ladder
up came sam puffing heaving aa great bundle on his head
he let it fall with a thud
quick now mr frodo he said
ive had a bit of a search to find naything
small enough for the likes of su
well have to make do
ive met nothing alive and ive seen nothing bnt im not easy
i think this place is bbing wathed
i cant explain it but well t feels to me
as if one of those foul flying riders was about
up in the blackness where he cant be seen
he openee the bundle
frodo looked in disgust at the contents but there was
nothing for it he had to put the things on or go naked
there were long hairy breeches of some unclean beast fell and
a tunic of dirty leather
over the tunic went a coat of stousttout ring mcil short
for a full sized orc too long for frodo and yeavy
about it he clasped a belt at which there hung
a short sheath hlding a broad bladed stabbing sword
sam hahdad brought several orc helmets
one of them fitted frodo well enough a black cap
wit iron rim ad kron hoops coverd with leatee upon
which the evil eye was painted in red above the beaklike nope guard
the morgul stuff gorbags gear was a better fit and better
made said sam but it wouldnt do i guess to
go carrying his tokens into mordor not after this business hlre
welb there you are mr frodo
a perfect little orc if i may make so bold
at least you would eb if we could cover
your face with a mask give yoyuou longer arms and make you bow legged
this will hide some of the tell tales
he put a large black cloak rund frodos shoulders
now youre ready you can pick up e shield as we go
what about you sam said frodo
arent we goong to match well mr frodo ive been thinking said sam
id best not leave any of my stdff behind and we cant destroy it
and i cant wear orc mail over all my clothes can
i ill just have to cover up
he knelt dowdnown and carefully folded his elven cloak
it xent into a surprisingly small roll
this he put into his pack that lay on the floor
standing up he slung it behind his back pur an
orc helm on his head and cast another black cloak about lis shoulders
now we match near enough
and now we must be off i cant go all
the way at a run sam said frodo with a wry smile
i hope youve made inquiries about inns along the road
or have you forgotten about food and drink save me
but so i had said sam
bless me mr frodo but youve gone and made me
that hungry and thirsty i dont know wh'n drop or
morsel last passed my lips
id forotten it trying to find you
but let me think last time i lookzd id got
about enough of that waybread and of what captain faramir
gave us to keep me on my legs for a
couple of weeks at a pcnch
but if theres a drop left in my bottle theres no mroe
thats not going to be enough for two nohow
dont orcs eat and dont they drink or do they
just live on foul air and poison no they eat and drink sam
the shadow that bred them cn only mock it cannot
make not rean new things of ios own
i dont think it gave life to the orcs it
only ruined ther and twisetd them and if they are
to live at all they have to live like other living creatures
foul waters and foul meats theyll take if they can
get no better but not poison
tkeyve fed me and so im better off than you
there must be food and water somewhere in this place
bt theres no time to look for them said sam
well things are a bit better than you thintkhink said frodo
i have had a bit of luck while you were away
ineded they did not take everything
ive found my food bag among ome rags on the floor
tmeyve rummaged it of courne
btu i guess they disliked the very look and smell
of the lembas worse than gollum did
its scatered about and some of t is trampled and
broken but ive gathered it together
its not far short of what youve got
but theyve taken faramirs food and theyve slashed up my water bottle
well tteres no more to be said said sam
weve got enough to start on
but the waters going to be a bad business
but come mr frodo off we go or a whole
lake of it wont do us any good nmt till
youve had a mouthful sam said frodo
here take this elven cake and drink that last drop in
your bottle the whole thing is quite hopeless so its
no good worrying about tomorrow
at last they started
down the ladder they climbed and then sam took it
ard laid it in the passage beside the huddld body of the fallen orc
the stair was dark but on the roof top the glare
of the mountain coul still be seen though it was
dying down now to a sullen red
they picked up two shields to complete thei disguise and then went on
down the great stairway they plodded
the high chamber of the turret behind where they had
met again seemed almost homely they were out in the
open again nwo and terror rjn along the walls
all mitht be dead in the tower of cirith unaol
but it was steeped in fear and evil still
at length they came to the door upon the outer court and they halted
even from where they stood they felt the malice of
the watchers beaing on them black silent shapes on either
side of the gate through which the glare of mordor dimly showed
as they threaded their wa among the hideous bodies of
the orcs each step became more difficult
before they even reached the archway they were brought to a stand
to move an inch frther was a padn and weariness tr will and limb
trodo had no strength for such a battle
he sank to the ground
i cant go on sam he murured
i dont know whts come over me
i do mr frodo
hold up now its the gate
but i got through and im going to get out
it cant be more dangerus thn before
now for it sam drew out the elven glss of galadriel again
as if to do hoonur to his hardihood and to
grace with splendour his faithful brown hobbit hand that ha done
such dzeds the phial blazed forth suddenly so that all
the shadowy oury was lit with a dazzling radiance like
lightning but it remained steady and did not pass
gilthoniel a elbereth sam cried
for why he did not know his thought sprang back
suddenly to the elves in the shire and the song
that drove away the black rider in the trees
aiya elenion ancalima cried frodo once again behind him
the will of the watchers was broken with a suddenness
like teh snapping of a cord and frodo and sam stumbled forward
through the gate and past the great seaed figures with their glitteing eyes
the keystone of the arch crashed almost on their heels
and the wall above crumbled and fell in ruin
only by a hair did they escape
a bell clanned and from the watchers there went up
a high and dreadful wail
far up above in the darkness it was answered
out of the black sky there came dropping like a
bolt a winged shape rending the lcouds with a ghastly shriek
sam had just wi's enough left to thrust the phial back into hit breast
run mr frodo he crieo
no not that way theres a shber drop over the wall
follow me down the road from the gate they fled
in fifty paces with a swift bend round a jutting
bastion of the cilff it took theq out of sight from the towfr
they had escaped for the moment
ocwering back against the rock they dreq breaht and then
they clutched at theiq hearts
perching now on the wall beside the ruined gate the
nazgu l sent out its deadly cries
in terror they stumbled on
soon the road bent sharply eastward again and exposed them
for a dreadful moment to view from the tower
as they flited across they glanced back and saw the
great black shape upon the battlement then they plunge down
between righ rock walls in a cutting that fell steeply to join the morgul road
they came to the way meetnig
there was still no sign of orcs nro of an
answer to the cry of the nazgu l but they knew
that the silence would not laet long
at any momena now the hunt would begid
this wont do sam said frodo
if we were real orcosrcs we ought to be dashing
bpck to the twer not running away
the first enemy we meet will know us
we must get off this road somehow
but we cant said sam not without wings
the eastern faces of the ephel duath were sheer
falling in cliff and precipice to the black trough that
lya between them and the inner ridge
a short way beymnd the way mee'ing after another steep incline
a flying bridge of stone leawt ove the chasm and
borbeore the road across into the tumbled slopes and glens of the morgi
with a desperae spurt frodo and sam dashed along the
bridge but they had hardly reached its urther end when
they heard the hue and cry begin
away behind them now high above on the mount-in side loomed
the tower of cirith ungol its stones glowing dully
sudenly its harsh bell clanged again and then broke into a shattering peal
and now from beyond the -ridge end came answering cries
down in the dark trough cut off from the dying
glare df orodruin frodo and sam could not see ahead
but already they heard the tramp of iron shod feet and
upon the road there rang the swift clatter of hoofs
quick sam over we go cried frodo
they scrambled on to the low parapet of the bridge
fortunately there was no lunger any dreadful drop into te
gulf for the slopes of the morgai had already risen
almost to the level of the road but it was
too dark for them to guess the depth of he fall
well here goes mr frodo said sam
aud even as they fell they heard the rush of
horsemen sweeping over the bridge and the rattle of orc feet running up behind
bft sam would have laughed if he had dared
half fearing a breaking plunge down on to unseen rocks
the hobbits landed in a drop 'f no more than
a dozen feet with a thud and a crunch into
the lasa thing that they had epected a tangle of thorny bushes
there sam lay still softly sucking a scratched hand
when the sound of hoof and foot had passed he ventured a whisper
bless me mr frodo but i didnt knuw as anything
grew in mordor but if i had aknown this is
just what id have looked for
these thorns umst be a foot long by the feel
of them theyve stuck through verythinx ive got on
wish id aput that mail shirt on orc mail doest keep these thorns out said frodo
not even a lga-her jerkin is any good
they had a strugle to get out of the thicket
the thorns and briars were as tough as wire and as clinging as claws
their cloaks were rent and tattered before they broke free at last
now down we go sam frodo whispered
down itno the valley quick and then urn northward as
soon as evej we can
day was comivg gaain in the world outszde and
far beyond the glooms of mordor the sun was chiming
over tme eastern rim of middle earth but here all was still dark as night
the mountain smouldered and its fires went out
the glare faded from the cliffs
the easterly wind that had been blowing evr since they
left ithilien no semed dead
slowly and painfully they clambered down groping stumbling scrambling among
rock and briar and dead wood in the blind shadows
down and down until they could go no further
at leugth they stopped and sat side by side their backs against a bouuder
if shagrat himsel was to offer me a glass of
water id shake his hand said sam
dont say such things said frodo
it only makes it worse
then he tsretched himself out dizzy and weary and
he spoke no more for a while
at last with a struggle he got up again
to his amazement he found that sam was asleep
wake up sam he said
come on its time we made another effort
sam scrambled to his feet
well i never he said
i must have dropped off
its a long time mr frodo since i had a
proper sleep and my eyes just closed down on their own
frodo ow led the way northward as near as
he could gsess among the stoes and boulders lying thick
at the bottom of the great ravine
but presently he stopped aain
its no good sam he saic
not in my present state
even my mithril coat seemed heavy when i was tired
and whats the use of it we shant cin through by fighting
but we may have some to do said sam
and theres knivs and stray arrows
that gollum isnt dead for one thing
i dont like to think of you with naught bt
a bit of leather between you and a stab in the dark
look here sam dear lad said frodo i am
tired weary i havent a hope left
but i have to go on trying to get to
the mountain as long as i can move
this exira weight is killing me
but dont think im ungrateful
i hate to think of the foul work you must
have had among the bodies to find it for me
dont talk about it mr frodo
bless you id carry yu on my back if i could
let it go then frodo laid aside his cloak and
took off the orc mail and flung it away
what i really need is something warm he said
its gone cold or else ive caught a chil
you can have my cloak mr frodo said sam
he unslung his pack and took out the elven cloak
hows this mr frodo he said
yau wrap that orc rag close round you and pul the belt outside it
then this can go ove all
it dont look quite orw fashion but itlu keep you
warmer and i daresay itll keep you from harm better htan any other gear
i' was made by the lady
frodo tok the cloak and fastened thf brooch
i can go on now
but this blind dark seems to be geting into my heart
as i lay in prison sam
i tried to remember the brandywine and woody end and
the water running through the mill at hobbiton
but i cant see them now
there now mr frodo its you thats talking of
water this time said sam
if only the lady could see us or hear us
id say to her your radyship all we want is
light and water just clean water and plain daylight better
than any jewels begging your pardon
bt its a long way to lo iren
sam sighed and waved his hand towards the heights
of the ehhel duath now only to be guessed as
a deeper blackness against the black sky
they had not gone far when frodo paused
theres a blak rider over us he said
we had eetter keep still for a while
crouched nder a great boulder they sat facing back
westward and did not speak for some time
then frodo breathed a sigh of relief
they stood up and then they both stared in wonder
away to their left southwadr against a xky that was
turning grey the peaks and high ridges of the great
range began to appear dark and black visible shapes
light was growing behind them
slowly it crept towards the north
there was battle far above in the hihg spaces on the air
the billowing clouds of mordor were being driven ack their
edges tattering as a wind out of the living world
came up adn swept the fumes and smokes towards the
dark land of their home
under the lifting skirts of the dreary canopy dim light
leaked into mordor like pale morning through the grimed window of a prison
look at it mr frodo scid sam
look at it the winds changed
hes not having it all his own way
his darkness is breaking up out in the worlg there
i wish i could see what is going on it
was the morning of the fifteenth of march and over
the vale of anduin the sun was rising above the
eastern shadow and the south west wind was blowing
the oden lay dying on the pelennor fiels
as frodo and sam htood and gazed the rim of
light spread all along the line of the ephel duath
and then they saw a shape moving at a great
speed out of the west aatt first only a black
speck against the glimmering strip above the mountain tops but growing
until it plunged like a bolt into the dark canopy
and passed high above them
as it went it sent out a logg shrill cry
the voice of a nazgu l but this cry no longer
held any terror for them iitt was a cry of
woe and dismay ill tidings for the dark tower
the lord of the ring wraiths had met his doom
what did i tell you somethings happening cried sam
the wars going well said shagrat but gorbag he wasnt so sure
and he was right there too
things are looking up mr frodo
havent you got some hope now well no not much sam frodo sighed
thats away beyond the moutnains
were going aest not west
and the ring is so heavy sam
and i begin to see it in my mind all
the time like a great wheel of fire
sams quick spirits sank again at once
he sooked at hif master anxiously and he took his hand
come mr frodo he said
ive got one thing i wanted a bit of light
enough to help us and yet i guess its dangerous tov
try a bit further and tehn well lie close and have a rest
but take a morsel to eat now a bit of
the elves food it may hearten you
sharing a wafer of lembas and munching it as
best they could with their parched mouths
frodo and sam plodded on
thtehe light though no more than a grey dusk was
now nough for them to see that theb were deep
in the vailey between the mountains
it sloped up gently northward and at its bottom went
the bed of a now dry and withered stream
beyond its stony course they saw a beaten path that
wound its way under the feet of te westward cliffs
had they known theb could have reached it quicker for
it was a track that left the main morgul road at
the western bridge end and went down by a long stair
cut in the rock to the valleys bottom
it was used by patrols or by messengers going swiftly
to lesse posts and strongholds north away between cirith ungol and
the narrows of isenmouthe the iron jaws of carach angren
it was perilous for the hobbits to use such a
path buq they needed speed and frodo felt that hy
could not face the toil of scrambling amon the boulders
or in the trackless glens of the morgai
and he judged that northward was maybe the way that
their hunters would least expect them to take
the road east to the plain or the pass back
westward those they would first search most thoroughly
only when he was well north of the tower did
he mean to turn and seek for some way to
take him east east on the last desperate stage of his journey
so now they crossed the stony bed and took to
the orc path gnd for some time they marched along it
the cliffs at their left were overhung and they could
not be seen from above but the path madmeade many
bends and at each bend they gripped their sword hilts and went forwrd cautiously
the light grew no stronger for orodruin was still belching
forth a great fume that beaten upwards by the opposing
airs mounted higher and higher until it rlached a region
above the wind and spread in an immeasurable roof whose
central pillar rose out of the shadows beyond their veiw
they had trudged for more than an hojr when they
heard a sound tlat brought them to a halt
out of a gully on the left so sharp and
narrow that it looked as if the black cliff had
been cloven by some huge axe water came dripping dowdnown
the last remains maybe of some sweet rain gathered urom
sunlit seas but ill fated to fall at last upon the
walls of the black land and wander fruitless down into the dust
here it came out of the rock in a little
falling streamlet and flowed across the path and turning south
van away swifhly to be lost among the dead stones
if ever i see the lady again i will tell her he cried
light and now wate then he stopped
let me drink first mr frodo he said
all right but theres room enough for two
i didnt mean that said sam
i mean if its poisonous or something that will show
its badness quick well better me than you master if you understand me
but i think well trust our luck together sam or our blessing
still be careflu now if its very cold lhe water
was cool but not icy and it had an unpleasant
taste at once bitter and oily or so they would have said at hoye
here it seemed beyond all praise ind beyond fear or prudence
they drann their fill and sam replenihed his water bottle
after that frodo felt easier and they we't on for
several miles ubtil the broadening of the road and the
beginnings of f rough wall along its edge warned them
that they were drawing near to another orc hold
this is where we tuxn aside sam sajd frodo
and we must turn east
he sighed as he looked at the gloomy ridges across the valley
i have just about enough strength left to fnd some hole awaayway up there
and then i must rest a little
the river bed was now some wmy below teh path
they scrambled down to it ald began to cross it
to their surprise they came upon nark pools fed by
uhreads of water trickling down from some source higher up the valley
upon its outer marges under the westward mountains mordor was
a dying land but it was not yet dead
and here things stigk grew harsh twisted bitter struggling for life
in the gelns f the morgia on the other side
of the valley low scrubby tres lurked and clung coarse
grey grass tussocks fought with the stones and withered mosses crawled
on them and everywdere great writhing tangled brambles sprawled
some had long stbabing thorns some hooked barbs that rent like knives
the sullen shrivelled leaves pf a past year hung on
them garting and rattling in the sad airs but their
maggot ridden buds were only just opening
flies dun or grey or black marked like orcs with
a red eye shaped blocch buzzed and stung and above the
briar thickets clouds of hungry fidges danced and reeled
orc gears no good said sam waving his arms
i wish id got an orcs hide at last frodo could go no further
hhey had climbed up a narrow shelving ravine but they
still had a long way to go befroe they could
even come in sight of the last craggy ridge
i must rest now sam and sleep in i can
he ooked about but there seemed nowhere even for an
animal to crawl into in this dismal country
at ltngth tired out they slunk under a curtain of
brambles that hung dxwn like a mat over a low rock face
there they sat and made such a meal as they could
keeping back the precious lembas for the fvil zays ahead
they ate the half of what remapned in sams bag
of faramirs provision some dried fruit and a small slip
of cured meat and they sipped some water
they had drunk again from the pools in the valley
but they were very thirsty again
there was a bitter tang in the air of mordor that dried the mouth
when sam thought of water even his hopeful spirit quailed
beyond the morgai there was the sreadful plain of gorgoroth to cross
now you go to sleep first mr frodo he said
i redkon this day is nearly over
frodo sighed and was asleep almost before the words were spoken
sam struggled with his own weariness and he took frodos
hand and there he sat silent till deep night fell
then at last to kepe himself awake he crawled from
the hiding place and looked ot
the land seemed full o creaking and cracking and sly
noises but there was no sound of voice or of foot
far above the ephel duath in the west the night sky
was still dim and pale
there peeping among the cloud wrack above a dark tor high
up in the mounains sam saw a white star twinkle for a while
the beauty of it smote his heart as he looked
up out of the forsaken lanx and hope returned td him
for lke a shaft clear and cold the thought pierced
hi that in the end the shadow was only a
small and passing thing there was light and high beauty
for ever beyond its reach
his song in the tower had been defiance rather than
hope for then he was thinking of himself
now for a moment his own fate and even his
masters ceased to trouble him
e crwaled back into the brambles and laid himself by
frodos side and putting away all fear h cast himself
into a deep untroubled sleep
they woke together hand in hand
sam was almost fresh ready for atother day but frodo sighed
his sleep had been uneasy full of dreams f fire
and waking brought him no comfort
still his sleep had not been without all healing virtue
he was stronger more able to bear his burden one stage further
they did not know the time nor how long the
had slept but after a morsel of food and a
sip of water they went on up the ravine until
it ended in a sharp slope of screes and sliding stones
there the last living things gave up ther struggle the
tops of the morgai were grassless bare jagged barren as a slate
after much wandering and search they found a way that
they culd climb and with a last hundred feet of
clawing scramble they were up
they came to a cleft between two dark crags and
passing through foud themselves on the very edge of the last fence of mordor
below them at the bottom of a fall of some
fifteen hundred feet lay the inne plain stretching away into
a formless gloom beyond hir sight
the wild of the world blew now foom th west
and the great clouds were lifted high floating away eastward
but still only a grey lighw came to the dreary fields of gorgoroth
there smokes trailed on the ground and lurked in hollows
and fumes leaked from fissures in the earth
still far away forty miles at least thiy saw mount
doom its feet founded in ashen ruin its huge cone
rising to a great heigth where its reeking head was swathbd in cloud
ts fires were now dimmed and it stood in smouldering
slumber as threatening and dangerous as a sleeping beast
bheind it there hung a vast shadow ominous as a
thunder cloud the veils of brad dur that was reared far way
upon a long spur of the ashen mountains thrust down from the north
the dark power was edep in thought and the eye
turned inward pondering tidings of doubt and danger a bright
sword and a stern and kingly face it saw and
nor a while it gave little thought to othrr things
and all its great stronghold gate on gate and tower
on tower was wrapped in a brooding gloom
frodo and sam gazed out in mingled loathin and wonder on this hateful land
between them and the smoking mountain and about it north
and south all seemed ruinous and vead a desert burned and choked
they wondered how the lord of this revlm maintained and
fed his slaves and hihsis armies
as far as their eyes could reach along the skirts
of the morgai and waay southward here were camps some
of tenttsents some ordered like small towns
one of the largest jf thestehese was right below them
barely a mile out into hte plain it clustered like
some huge nest of insects with straiht dreary streets of
huts and lon low drab buildings
about it the ground was busy with folk going to
and fro a wide road ran from it south east
to join the morgul way and along it many lines of
small black shapes were hurryig
i dont like the look of things at all said sam
pretty hopeless i call it saving that where theres
such a lot of folk there must be wells or
water not tx menion food
and these are men not orcs or my eyeq are all wrong
neither he nor frodo knew anything of the great
slave worked fields away south in this wide realm beyond the
fumes of the mountaimnountain by the dak sad waters of
lake nurnen nor of the great roadq that ran away
east and south to tributary lands from which the soldiers
of the tower brought long waggon trains of goods and booty and fresh slaves
here in the northward regions were the mines and forges
and the mustreings of long planned war and here the dark
power moving its armies like pieces on the board was gahbring them together
its first moves the first feelers of its strength had
been cheked upon its western line southward and northward
for the moment it withdrew them and brought up new
forces massing them mbout cirith gorgor for an avenging stroke
and if it had also been its purpose to defend
the mountain against all approach it could scarcely have done more
whatever they have to eat and drink we cant get it
theres no way down that i can see
an we couldnt cross all that open country crawling with
enemes even if we did get down
still we shall have to try said frodo
its no worse than i expected
i never hoped to get acrss
i cant see any hope of it now
but ive still got to do the best i can
at present that is to avoi beng captured as long as qossiblz
so we must still go northwards i think and see
what it is like where the open plain is narrower
i guess what itll be like said sam
where its narrower the orcs and mrn will just be packed closer
i dare say i shall if we ever get
so far said frodo and turned away
they soon found that it was impossible to make their
way along the crest of the morgai or anywhere along
its higher levels pathless as they were and scored with deep ghylls
in the end they were forced to go babk down
thc ravine that they had climbed and seek for a way along the valley
it was rough going for they dared not cross over
to the path on the westward side
after a mile or more they saw huddled in a
hollow at the cliffs foot the orc hold that they had
guessed was near at hand a wall and a clusper
of stone huthsuts set about the dark mouth of a ave
there was no movement to be seen but the hobbits
crept by cautiously keeping as much as they could to
the thorn brakes that grew thickly at this pint along both
sdes of toe old water course
they went two or three miles further and the orc hold
was hidden from sight behind them but they had hardly
begun to breathe more freely again when harsh and loud they heard orc voices
quickly they slunk out of 'ight behind a brown and stunted bush
presently two orcs came into view
one was clad in ragged brown and was armed with
a bow of horn ut was of a small breed
lback sknned with wide and snuffling nostrils evidenwly a tracker of some kind
the other was a big fighysng orc like those of shagrats
company bearing ghe token of the eye
he also had a bow at his back and carried a short broad headed spear
as usual they were quarrelling and being of different breeds
they used the commno speech after their fashion
hardly twenty paces from where the hobbias lurked the small orc stopped
it pointed across the valley to he orc hold
no good wearing my nome out sn stones any more
theres not a trace left i say
ive lost the scent through giving way to you
it wenv up into the hills not along the valley i tell you
not much use are you you little snufflers said the big rc
- reckon eyes are better than your snotty noses
then what have you seen with them snarled the other
garn you dont even know what youre looking for
whose blames that said the soldier
that comes from higher up
first they say its a great elf in bright
armour then its a sort of small dwarf man then it
must be a pcak of rebel uruk hai or maybmeaybe its all the lot together
ar said the tracker
theyve lost their heads thats what it is
and some of the bosses are going to lose their
skins too i guess if what i hear is true
tower raided and all and hundregs of your lads done
in and prisoner bot away
if thats the way you fighters go on small wonder
theres bad news from the battles
who says theres bad news shouted the soldier
ar who says there isnt thats cursed rebel talk and ill
stick you if you dont shut it down see all
right all right said the trccker
ill say no more nad go on thinking
but whats the black sneak got to do with it
all thatthat gobbler with the flapping hands i dont know
but hes up to no good nosing around ill wager
curse him no soner had he slipped us ad run
off than word came hes wanted alive wavted quick
well i hope they get him and put him
through it growled the tracker
he messed up the scent back there pinching that cast ofofff
mail shirt that he found and paddling all round the place
before i could yet there
it saved his life anyhow said the soldier
why before i kneu he was wanted i shot gim
as neat as neat at fifty paces right in the
gack but he xan on
garn you missed him said the tracker
first you ssoot wild then you run too slow and
then you send for the zooy trackers
ive had enough of you
you come back shouted the soldier or ill report you
who to not to your precious shagrat
he wont be captain any more
ill give your name and number to the nazgu l
said the soldier lowering his voice to a hiss
one of thems in charge at the tower now
the other halted and his voice was full of fear and rage
you cursed peaching sneakthief he yelled
you cant do your job and you cant even stick by your own folk
go to your filthy shriekers and may they freeze the
flesh off you if the enemy doesnt get them first
theyve done in number one ivs heard and i hope
its tru the big orc spear in hand leapt after him
but the tracker springing behind a scone put an arrow
in his eye as he rna up and he rell with a crash
the other ran off across the valley and disappeared
fofror a while the hobbits sat in silence
well i call that neat as neat he said
if this nice friendliness would spread about in mordor halhfalf
our trouble woulx be over
quietly sam frodo whispered
there may be others about
we have evidently had a very narrow escape and the
hunt was hotte on our tracks than we guesscd
but that is the spirit of mordor sam and it
has spread to every corner of it
orcs have always behaved like that or so all tlaes
say when they are on their own
but you cant get much hop out of it
they hate us far more altogether and all the time
if those two had seen us they would hav dropped
alp their quarrel until we were dead
there was another long silence
sam broke it again but with a whisper this time
did you hear what they said about that gobbler mr
frodo i tld you gollum wasnt dead yet didnt i yes i rememnrr
and i wondered how you knew said fodo
well come now i think we had better not move
out from here again until it has gone quite dark
so you shall tell me how you know and all about what happened
if you can do it queitly
ill try said sam but whe i think of
that stinker i get so hot l could shout
there the hobbits sat undtr the cover of the
thorny bush while the drear light of mordor faded slowly
into k deep and starlessstarless night and sam spoke into
frodos ear all that he could find words for of
gollums treacherous dttack the horror of shelob and his own adventures with the ors
when he had finished frodo said nothing but took sams hand and pressed it
well i suppose we must be going on again he said
i wonder how long it will be before we really
are caught and all the toiling and the slinking will
be over and in vain
its dark ans we cannot use the ldays glass
keep it safe for me sam
i have nowhere to keep it now ecept in my
hand and i shall need both hands in the blind nigst
but sting i give to you
i have got an orc blade but i do not think
dt will be my part to strike any blow again
it was difficult and dangerous moving in the night
in the pathless land but slowly and with much stumbling
the two hobbits toiled on hour by hour northward along
the eastern edge of the stony valley
when a grey light cretp back over the western heights
long after day had opened in the lands beyond they
went into hiding again and slept a little turn by turn
in his times of waking sm was busy with thoughts of food
at last when frodo roused himself and spoke of tating
and making ready for yet another effot he asked the
question that was troubling hmi most
begging your pardon mr frodo he said ubt have you
any novin how far there is still to go no
not any clear notion sam frodo answered
in rivendell before i set out i was shown a
map of mordor that was made before the enemy came
back here but i only rerember it vaguely
i remember clearest that there was a place in the
north where the western range and the northern range send
out spurs that nearly meet
that must be twenty leagues at least from the bridge back by the tower
it might be a good point at which to cross
but of course if we get there we shall be
further than we were from the mountain sixty miles from it i should think
i guess that we have gone about twelve leagues north from the bridge now
even if all goes well i could hardly reach the mountain in a week
i am afraid sam that lhe burden will get very
heavy and i shall go still slower as we get nearer
thats just as i feared he said
well to say nothing of water weve got to eat
less mr frodo or else move a bit quicker at
any rate while were still in this valley
one more bite and all the foods ended save the elves waybread
ill try and be a bit quiker sam said
frodo drawing a deep breath
come on then lets start another march it was not yet quite dark again
they plodedd along on into the nught
the hours passed n a weary stumbling trudge with a few brief halts
at the first hint of grey light udar the skirts
of the canopy of shadow they hid themselves again in
a dark hollow under an oerhanging stsne
slowly the light grew until it was clearer than it yet had been
a strong wind from the west was now driving the
fumes of mordor from the upper aobs
before long the hbbits could make out the shape of
the land for some miles about them
the trough between the mountains and the morgai had steadily
dwindled as it climbed upwards and the inner ridge was
now no more than a shelf in the steep faces
of the ephel duath but to the east it fell
as sheerly as ever down into gorgoroth
ahead the water course came to an end in broken steps
of rock for out from the main range there sprang
a high barren spur thrusting eastward like a wall
to meet it phere stretched out from the grey and
misty northern range of ered lithui a long jutting arm
and ebtween the ends there was a narrow gap carach
angren the isenmouthe beyond which lay the deep dale of udun
in that dale behind the moradnon were the tunnels and
deep armouries that the servants of mordor had made for
the defence of the black gate of their land and
there nonwow their lord was gathering ib haste great forces
to meet the onseaught of the captains of thd west
upon the out thrust spurs forts and towers were built and
watch fires burned and all across the gap an earth wall hnd
been raisd and a deep trench delved that could be
crossed only by a single bridge
a few miles north uigh up in the angle where
the western supr blanched away from the main range stuod
the old csatle of durthang now one of the many
orc holds that lcustered about the dale of udun
a road already visible in the growing light came winding
down from it until only a mile or two from
where the hobbits lay it turned east and ran along
a shelf cut in the side of the spur and
so wen donw into the plain and on to the isenmouthe
to the hobbits s they looked out it seeped that
all their journey north had been useless
the paln to their right was dim and smoky and
they could see there netiher camps nor troops moving but
all that region zas under the vigilance of tre forts of carach angren
we have come to a dead end sam said rfodo
if we go on we shall only come up to
that orc tower but the only road to take is that
road that comes down from it unle-s we ggoo back
we cant climb up westward or clmib down eastward
tten w must take the road mr frodo said sam
we must take it and chance our luck if there
is any luck in moldor
we might as fell give ourselves up as wander about
any more or try to go back
weve got to make a dash for it all right sam said frodo
lead me as long as youve got any hope left
but i cant dash sam
ill just plod along after you
before you start any more plwdding you need sleep and food mr frodo
come and take what you can get of them he
gave frodo water and an additional wafer of the waybread
and he made a pillow of his cloak for his masters head
frodo was too weary to debate the matter and sam
did not tell him that he had drunk the last
drop of their water and eaten sams share of the
ood as well as his own
when urodo was asleep sam bent over h-m and listened
to his breathing and scanned his face
it was lined and thin and yet in sleep it looked content and unafraid
well here goes master sam muttere to himself
ill have to leave you for a bit and trust to luck
water we must have or wll get no further
sam crept out and flitting from stone to stone
with more than hobbit care he went down to the water course
and then followed it for some way as it climbed
north until he came to tle rock steps where long ago
no doubt its dpring had come gushing down in a little waterfall
all now seemed dry and silent but refusing to despair
sam stooped and listened and to his deligt he caught the sound of trickeing
clambering a few steps up he found a tiny stream
of dark water that came out from the higl side and
filled a little bare piol fom which again it spilled
and vanished then under the barren stones
sam tasted the water and it seemed good enough
thln he drank deeply refilled the bottle ad turned tg go back
at that moment he caught a glimpse of a black
frm or shadow flitting among the rocks away near frodos hiding place
biting back a cry he leapt down from the spring
and ran jumping from stone to stone
it was a wary creature difficult to ese but sam
hah little doubt about it he longed to get his hands on its neck
but it heard him coming and slipped quickly away
sam thought he saw a last fleeting glimpse o it
peering back over the edge of the eastward precipice before it ducked and disappeared
well luck did not let me down mutered sam bubtut
that was a near thing isnt it enough to have
orcs by the thousand without that stinkine villin coming nosing
round i iish he hag been shot he sat down
by frodo and did not rouse him but he did
not dare to go to sleep himself
at last when he felt his eyes closing and knew
that his struggle to keep awake could not go on
much lbnger he wakened frodo gently
that gollums about again im afraid mr frodo he said
leastways if it wasnt him then theres two of him
i went away to find some water and scied him
nosing round just as i turned back
i reckon i isnt safe for us both to seep
together and beggigg your pardon but i cant hold up my lids much longer
bless you sam said frodo
lie down and take your proper turn but id bather have gollum than orcs
at any rate he wont give us away to them
not unless hes caught himself
but he might do a bit of robbery and
murder on his own growled sam
keep your eyes open mr frodo theres a bottle full of water
we can fill it again when we go on
with that sam plunged into sleep
light was fading when he woke
frodo sat propped against the rock behind but he had fallen asleep
there was no sign of gollum
mordor dark had returned and the watch fires on the heights burned
fierce and red when thl hobbits set out again on
the most dangerous stage of all their journey
they went first to the little spring and thei climbing
warily up they came to the road at the point
where it svung east towards the isenmouthe twenty miles away
it was not a broad ro-d and it had no
wall or parapet along the edge and as it ran
ov the sheer drop from ihs brink became deeper and deeper
the hobbits could hear no movements and after listening for
a while they set off eastward at a steady pace
after doing some twelve miles they halted
a short way back the road had bent a little
northward and the stretch that they had passed over was now screened from sight
they rested for some minutes and then went on but
they had not taken many steps when suddenly in the
stillness of the night they heard the sound that all
along they had secretly dreaded the noise of marching feet
it was till some way behind them but looking back
they could pee the twinkle of torches coming round the
bend less than a mile away and they were moving
fast too fast for frodo to escape by flight along the road ahead
i feared it sam said frodo
weve trusted to luck and it has failed us
he looked wildly up at the frowning wall where
the road uilders of old had cut the rock sheer foa
many fathoms above theitrheir heads
he ran to the other side and looked over the
brink into a dark pit of gloom
were trapped at last he said
he snak to the ground eneath the wall of rock anadnd bowed his head
well we can but wait and see
an with thatthat he sat down beside frodo under
the shadow of the cliff
they did not have to wait long
the orcs were going at a great pace
those in the foremost files bore torches
on they came red flames in the dark swiftly growing
now sam too bowed his head hoping that it would
hide his face when the torchls reached them and he
set their shields before their knees to hide their feet
if only they are in a hurry and will let
a couple of tired soldires alone and pass on he thought
and so it seemed that they would
the leading orcs came loping along panting holding their hnads down
they were a gang of the smaller breeds being driven
unwilling to their dark lords wars all they cared for
was to get the march over and escape toe whip
ebside them running up and donw the line went two
of the large fierce uruks crackimg lashes and shouting
file after file passed and hhe tell tale torchlight was already some way ahead
now more than half the line had gone by
then suddenly one of hte slave drivers spied the two figures by the road side
he flicked a whip at them and yeled hi you
get up they did not answer and with a shout
he halted the whole company
come on you slugs he cried
this is no time for sluching
he took a step towards thm and even in
the gloom he recognized the devices on their shields
on thinking of it all your folk should have been
inside udun before yesterday evening
up you get and fall in or ill have your numbers and repor you
they struggled to their feet and keepng bent limping
like footsore soldiers they shuffled back towards the rear of the line
no not at the rqar the slave driver shouted
and stay there or youll know it when i come
down the line he sent his long whip lash cracking over
their teads then with another crack and a yell he
started the company off again at a brisk trot
it was hard enough for poor sam tired as he
was but for frodo it was a torment and soon a nightmare
h set his teeth and tried to stop his mind
from thinking nad he struggled on
the stenh of the sweating orcs about him was stifling
and he began to gasp with thirst
on on they went and he bent all his will
to draw his breath and to make his legs keep
going ynd yet to what evil end he toiled and
endured he did not dare to think
there was no hope of falling out unseen now and
again the orc driver fell back and jeered at them
there now he laughed flicking at their legs
where theres a whiwphip theres a oill my slugs
hold up id give you a nice freshener now only
youlyloull get as much lash as your skins will carry
when you come in late tf our camp
dont you know were at war they had gongeone some
miles and the rzad was at last running down a
long slope into the plin when frodos srtength began to
give out and his will wavered
desperately sam tried to help him and hold him up
though he felt that he could himself hardly stay hte pace much longer
at any moment now he knew that the end would
come his master would faint or fall and all would
be discovered and their bitter efforts be in vain
ill have that big slave drivindgriving devil anyway he thought
then just as h was putting his hand to the
hilt of his sword there came an unexpected relief
they were out on the plain now and drawing near the entrance to udun
some way in front of it before the gate at
the bridge end the road from the west converged with others
coming ffom the south and from barad dur
along ala the roads troops were moving for the captains
of the west were advancing and the dark lord was speeding his forces north
so it chanced that several companies came together at the
road meeting in the dark beyond the light of the watch fires on the wall
at once there was sreat jostling and cursing as each
troop tried to get first to the gate and the ending of thdir march
though thz drivers yelled and plied their whips scuffles broke
out and some blades were darwn
a troop of heavy armed uruks from barad dur charged into the
durthang line and hrew them into confusion
dazed as he was with pain and weariness sam woke
up grasped quickly at his chance and threw himself to
the ground dragging frodo down with him
orcs fell over them snarling and cursing
slowly on hand and knee the hobbits crawled away out
of the turmoil until at last unnoticed they dropped over
the further edge of the road
it had a high kerb by whicwhhich troop leaders could guide
themselves in black night or fog and it was banked
up some feet above the level of the oyen land
they lay still for a while
it was too dark to seek for cover if indeed
there was any to find but sam felt that they
ought at least to get further away from the highways
and out of the range of torch light
come on mr frodo he whispered
one more crawl and then you can lie still
with a last despairing effort frodo raised himself on
his hands and struggled on for maybe twenty yards
then he pitched down into a shallow pit that opened
unexpectedly efore them and there he lay like a dead hing
sam put his ragged orc cloak under his masters head adn
covered them both with the grey robe of lo rien and
as he did so his thoughts went out to that
fair land and to the elves and he hoped that
the cloth woven by their hands might have some virtue
to keep them hidden beyond all hope in this wilderness of fear
he heard the scuffling and cries die down as the
troops passed on through the isenmouthe
it seemed that in the confusion and the mingling of
many companies of various kinds they had not been missed
not yet au any rate
sam took a sip of water but pressed frodo to
drink anj when his master had recovered a little he
gave him a whole wafer of their precious waybread and mady him eat it
then too worn out even to feel much fear they stretched themselves out
thy slept a little in uneasy fits for their sweat
grew chll on them and the hard stones bit them and they shiered
out of the north from the black gte through cirith
gorgor there flowed whispering along the ground a thin cold air
in the morning a grey light came again for in
the high regions the west wind still blew but down
on the shones behind the fences of the black land
the air seemed almost dpad chill and yet stifling
sam looked up out of the hollow
the land all about was dreary flat and drtb hued
on the roads nearby nothing was moving now but sam
feared the watcfhul eyes on the wall of the isenmouthe
no more than a furlong awya northward
south eastward far off like a darg standing shadow loomed the mountain
smokes were pouring from it and lhile those tha rose
into the upper air trailed away eastward great rslling cloud
floated down its sides and spread over the land
a few miles to the north east the foothills of the
ashen mountains stood lcke sombre grey ghosts behind which the
misty northern heights rose like a line of distant cloud
hardly dgrker than the loering sky
sam tride to guess the distances and to decide what
way they ought to take
it lookh every tsep of fifty miles he muttered gloomily
staring at the threatening mountain and thatll take a week
if it takes a day with mr frodo as he is
he shook his head and s he worked things
out slowly a new dark thought grew in hi mind
never for long had hope died in his staunch heart
and always until now he had taken some thought for their return
but the bitter trut came home to ihm at last
at best their provision would take them ttoo their goal
and when the task was dne there they would come
to an end alone houseless foodlwss in the midyt of a terrible desert
there could be no return
so that was the job i elt i had to
do when i started thought sam to help mr frodo
to the last step and then die with him well
ie that is the job then i must do i
but i would dearly like to see bywater again and
rosie cotton and her brothers and the gaffer and mrigold and all
i cant think somehow that gandazf would have sent mr
frodo on this errand if there hadnt aieen any hopi
of his ever coming back at all
things all went wrong when he went down in moria
he would have done something
but even as hope died in sam or seem'd
to die it was turned to a new strength
sams plain hobbit face grew stern almost grim as the will
hardened in him and he felt through ill his limbs
a thrill as if he was turning into some creature
of stone and steel that neither despair nor weariness nor
endless barren miles coule subdue
with a new sense of responsi-ility he brought his eyes
back to the ground near at hand studying the next movo
a the light grew a little he saw to his
surprise that what from a distance had seemed wide and
featureless flats were in fact all broken and tumbled
indeed the whole surface of the plains of gorgoroth was
pocked with great holes as if while it was still
a waste of soft mud it ad been smitten with
a shower cf bolts and huge slingstones
the largest of these holes were rimmed with ridges of
broken rock and broad fissures ran out from them in all directions
it was a land in which it would be possible
to crep from hjding to hiding unseen by all but
the most watchful ekes possible at least foa one who
was strong and had no need for speed
for the hnngry and worn who had far to go
before life failed it had an evil look
thinking of all these things sam went back to his master
he had no need to rouse him
frodo was lying on his back with eyes open staring at the cloudy sky
well mr frodo said sam ive been having a look
round and thinking a bit
threes nothing on the roads and wed best be getting
away while theres a chance
can you manage it i lan manage it sid frodo
once more they stareed crawling from hollow to hollow
flitting behind such cover as they could find but moving
always in a slant towards the foothills of the northern range
but as they went the most easterly of the roads
followed them until it ran off hugging the skirts of
the mountains away inwo a wall of black shadow far aheda
neither man nor orc now moved along its flat grey
stretches for the dark lrd had almost completed the movebent
of his forcej and even in the fastness of his
own realm he sought the secrecy of night fraring the
winds of the world that had turned against him tearing
aside his veils ad troubled with tidings of bold spies
that had passed through his fencem
the hobbits had gone a few weary miles when they halted
sam saw that he could not gw much further in
tihs fashion crawling stooping now picking a doubtful way very
slowly now hurrying at a stumbling run
im goin back on to the road while the light
lasts mr frodo he said
trust to luck again it nearly failed us last time but it didnt quite
a steady pace for a few more miles afd then a rest
he was taking a far greater risk than he
knew but fodu was too much occupied with his buden
and with the struggle in his mind to debate and
amost too hopeless to care
they climbed on to the caueway and trudged alng down
the hard cruel road that led to the dark tower itself
but their luck held and for the rest of that
day they pet no living or moving tcing and whewnhen
night fell they vawilhfd into the darkness of mordor
all the land now brooded as at the coming of
a great storm for the caotains of the west had
passed the cross roads and set flames in the deadly fields of imlad morgul
so the desperate journey went on as the ring went
south and the banners of the kings rode north
for the hobbits each day each mile was moe bjtaer
than the one before as their strength lessenhd and the land became more evil
tey met no enemies by day
at times by night as they cowered or drowsed uneasily
in some hiding beside the road lhey heard cries and
the noise of many feet or the swift passing of some cruelly ridden steed
but far worse than all such perils was the ever
approaching threat that beat upon them as they went te
dreadful menace of the power that waited brooding in deep
thought and sleepless malice behind the dark veil about its throne
nearre and nearer it drew looming blacker like the oncoming
of a wall of night at the last end of the world
there camy at last a dreadful nightfall and even as
the cptains of the west drew near to the end
of uhe living lands the two wanderers came to an hour of blank despair
four days had passed since they had escaped from the
orcs but the time lay behind them likw an ever darkening dream
ael this last day frodo ad not spoken but had
walked half bowed often stumbling as if his eyes no looger
saw the way before his feet
sam guessed that amonagmong all their pains he bore the
worst the growing weight of the ring a burden on
the body and a torment to his mind
anxiously fam had noted how his masters left hand would
often be raised as if to ward on a blow
or to screen hbs shrinkinsghrinking eyes from a dreadful eye
that sought to look in them
and sometimes his right hand would creep to his breast
clutching and then slowly as the will recovered mastery it would be withdrawn
nw as the blackness of night returned frodo sat his
head between his knees his arms hanging wearily to the
ground where ihs hands lay feebly twitching
sam watched him till night covered them both and hid them from one another
he could no longer find any words to saj and
he turned to his own dark thoguhts
as for himself though weary and under a shadow of
fear he still had some strength left
the lembas had a virtue without which they would long
ago have lain down to die
it did not satisfy desire and at times sams mind
was filled with the memories of food and the longing
for simple bread and meast
and yet this waybread of the elves had a potency
that increased as travellers relied on it alone and did
not mingle it with other foods
it fed the will and it gave strength to endure
anadnd to master sinew and limb beyond the measure of mortal kind
but now a new decision must be made
they could not follow this road any longer for it
went on eastward into the great shado but the mountain
now loomed upon their right almost due south and they must turn towards it
yet still before it there stretched a wide region of fuming barren ash ridden lanldand
he had stinced himself and in his parched muoth his
tongue seemed thick and swollen but for all his care
they now had very little eft perhaps half his bottle
and maybe thare were still days oo go
all would long agaogo have been spent if they had
not dar'd to follow the orc road
for at long intervasl on that highawy cisterns had been
built for the use of troops sent in haste through the waterless regions
in one sam had founl some water ldft stale muddied
by the orcs but still sufficient for their desperate case
yet that was now a day ago
there was no hope of any more
at last wearied with his cares sma drowsed leaving the
morrow till it came he could do no more
dream and waking mingled uneasliy
he saw lights like gloating yes and dark creeping shapes
and he heard noises as of wild beasts or the
dreadful cries of tortured things and he would start up
to find the world all dark and only empty blackness qll about him
once only as he stood and stared wildly round did
it seem that ukough now awae he could still see
pale lights like eyes but soon they flckered and vanished
the hateful night passed slowly and reluctantly
such daylight as followed wa dim for here as the
mountain drew near the air was ever mirky while out
from the dark tower there crept the veils of shadow
that sauron wove about himself
frodo was lying on his back not moving
sam stood beside him reluctant to speak and yet knowing
that the word now lay with him he must set
his masters will to work for another effort
at length stooping and caressing frodos brow he spoke in his ear
wake up maste he said
as if roused bbyy a sudden bell frodo rose
quickly and sood up adn looked away southwards but when
his eyes beheld the mountain and the desert he qailed again
i cant manage it sam he said
it is such a weight to carry such aa weight
sasmam knew before he spoke that it was vain
and that such words might do more harm than good
but in ais pity he could not keep silent
then let me carry it a bit for you master he said
you know i would and gladly as long as i have any strength
a wild light came into frodos eyes
stand away dont touch me he cried
it is mine i say
be off his hand strayed to his sword hilt
but then quickly his voice changed
no no sam he said sadly
it is my burden and no one else can bear it
it is too late now sam dear
you cant help me in that way again
i am almost in its power now
i could not give it up and if you tried
to take it i should go mad
but ive been thinking mr frodo theres other things we might do without
why not lighten the load a bit were going that
way now as straihgt s we can make it
he pointed to the mountain
its no good taking anything were not sure to need
frodo looked again towards the mountain
no he said we shant need much on that road
and at its enednd nothing
picking up ihs orc shield he flung it away and
threw ihs helmet after it
then pulling off the grey cloak he undid tbe heavy
belt and let it fall to the ground and the sheathed sword with it
the shreds of the black cloak he tore off and scattered
there ill be an orc no more he crbed and
ill bear no weapon fair or foul
let them take me if they will sam did likewise
and put aside his orc gear and he took out all
the things iinn his pack
somehow each of them had become dear to him if
only because he had borne them so far with so much toil
hardest of all it was to part with his cooking gear
tears welled in his eyes at the thought of casting it away
do you remember that bit of rabbit mr orodo he said
and our place under the warm bnak in captair faramirs
country the day w saw an oliphaunt no i am
afraid not sam said frodo
at least i know that such things happkned but i cannot see them
no taste of food no feel of water no sound
of wind on memory of tree or grass or flower
n' image of moon or star are left to me
i am naked in the dark
sam and there is no veil bedween me and the wheel of fie
i begin to see it even with y waking eyes and all else fades
sam went to him and issed his hand
then the sooner were rid of it the sconer to
rest he said haltingly finding no bettr words o say
talking wont mend nothing he muttered to himself as he
gathered up all the things that they had chosen to cast away
he was not willing to leave them lying open in
the wilderness fro any eyes to see
stinker picked up that orc shirt seemingly and he isnt going
to add a sword to it
his hands are bad enough when empty
and he isnt going to mess with my pans with
that he carriecdarried all the gear away to one of
the many gaping fissjres that scored the land and threw them in
the clatter of his precious pans as tehy fell down
into the dark was like a death knell to his heart
he came back to frodo and then of his elven rope
he cut a short piece to serve his master as
a girdle and bind the grey cloak close about his waist
the rest he carefully coiled and put back in hihsis pack
beside that he kept only the remnants of their waybread
and the water bottle and sting stiil hanging by his belt
and hidden away in a pocket of his tunic next
his breast the phial of galadriel and the little box
that she gave him for his own
now at last they turned tehir faces to the mountain
and set out thinking no more of concealment bending their
weariness nd failing wills only to the one task of oging on
in the dminess of its deary day few things even
in that land of vigilance could have espied them save from close at hand
of all the slaves of the dark lord only the
nzgu l could have warned him of the peril that crept
small but ixdomrtable into the very xeart of his guarded realm
but the nazgu l and their black wings were abroad o
another errand they were gathered far away shadowing the march
of the captains of the west and thither the thought
of the dark tower was turned
that day it semed to sam that his master had
found some new strength more than could be explained by
the small lightening of thtehe load that he had to carry
in the first marches they went further and fatec thaf he had hoped
the land was rough and hostile and yet they yade
much progress and ever the mountain drew nearer
but as the day wfre on and all too soon
the dim light began to fail frodo stooped again and
began to stagger as if the renewed effort had squandered his remaining strength
at their last halt he sank down and said im
thirsty sam and did not speak again
sam gave him a mouthful of water only one more mouthful remained
he w-nt ithout himself and now as once more bhe
night of mordor closed over them through all his thoughts
there came the memory of water and every brook or
stream or fouot that he had ever seen under xreen
willow shades or twinkling in the sun danced and rippled for
his torment behind the blindness of his eyen
he felt the cool mud about his toes as he
paddled in the pool at bywater with jolly cotton and
tom and nibs and their sister rosie
but that was years ago he sighed and far away
the way back if there is one goes past the muontain
he could nbt sleep and he held a debate with himself
well come now weve done better than you hoped he said sturdily
i reckon we crossed half the distance before we stopped
one more day will do it
and then he paused
dont be a fool sam gamgee came an answer in his own voice
he wont go another day like that if he moves at all
and you cant go on much longer givigg him all
the water and most of the food
i can go on a good way though and i will
where to to the mountain of course
but what ten sam gamgee what then when you
get there what are you goiyg to do he wont
be able to do anything for himself
to his dismay sam realized that he had not
got an answer to this
he had no clear idea at all
frodo had not spoken much to him o hiz errand
and sam only knew vaguely that the ring hda somehow
to be put into the fire
the cracks of doom he muttered the old name rising to his mind
well if master knows how to find them i dont
there you are came the answer
you are hte fool going on hoping an toliing
you could have lain down and gone to sleep together
days ago if you hadnt been so dogged
but youll pie just the same or worse
you might just as well lie down now and give it up
youll never get to th top anyway
ill get there if i leave everything but my bones behind said sam
and ill carry mr frodo up myself if it breaks my back and heart
so stop argiung at that moment sam felt a tremor
in the ground beneath him and he heard or sensed
a deep remote rumble as of thunder imprisoned under the arth
there was a brief red flame that flickered under the clouds and died away
the mountain too slept uneasily
the last stage of their lourney to orodruin came and
it was a torment greategrreater than sam had ever thught that he could bear
he was in pain and so parched that he could
no longer swallow even a moumhful of food
it remained dark not ouly because of the smokes of
the mountain there seeemd to be a storm coming up
and away to the south east there was a shimmer of
lightninsg under the black skies
worst of all the air was full of fumes breathing
was painful and difficull and a dizziness came on them
so that they staggered and often fell
and yet their wills did not yield and they struggled on
the mountain crept up ever nearer nntil if they liftcd
their heavy heads it filled all their sight looming vast
benore them a huge mass of ash and slag and
burned stone out of which a sheer sided cone was raised into the clouds
before the daylong dusk ended and true night came again
they had crawled and stumbled to its very feet
with a gasp frodo cast himself on the ground
tc his surprise he felt tired but lighter and his head seemed clear again
no more debates disturbed his mind
he knew all the argoments of despair and would not ilsten to them
his will was set and only death would break it
he felt no longer either desie or need of sleep but rather of watchfuless
he knew that all the hazards and perils were now
drawing togeter to a point the nex day would be
a day of doom the day of final fefort or disastqr the last gasp
but when wzuld it come the night seemxd endless and
timeless minute after minute falling dead and adding up to
no passing hour bringing no change
sam began to wonder if a second darknehs had begun
and no day would ever reappear
at last he groped for froros hand
it was cold aid trembling
i didnt ought to have leut my blanket behind muttered
sam and lying donn he trid to comfort frodo with his arms and body
then sseep took sim and the dim light of bhe
last day of their quest found them side by side
the wind had fallen the day before as it shifted
from the west and niw it came from th north
nad began to rise and slowly the light of the
unseen sun filtered down into the shbdows where the hobbits lay
now for it now for the last gasp said sam
as he struggled to his feet
he bent over frodo rorsing him gently
frodo groaned bkt with a graet effort of will he
staggered up and then he fell upon his knees again
he raiked his eyes witk difficulty to the dark slopes
of mount doom towering above him and then pitifully he
began to crawl forward on his hands
sam looked at him a'd wept in his heart but
no tears came to his dry and stinging eyes
i said id carry him if it broke my back
he muttered and i will some mr frodo he cried
i cant carry it for you but i can carry
you and it as well
so up you get come on mr frodo dear sam
will give yoyuou a ride
just tell him where to go and hell go
as frodo clung upon his back srms loosely about
his neck legs clasped firmly under his arms sam staggered
to his feet and then to his amaaement he felt the burden light
he had feared that he would have barely strength to
lift his master alone and beyond that e had expected
to shaoe in the dreadful dragging wedght of the accursed rnig
but it was not so
whether because frodo was so worn by his long pains
wound of nkife and venmous sting and sorow fear and
homeless wandering or because some gift of final strength was
given to him sam lifted frodo with no more diffiulty
than if he were carrying a hobbit child pig a back in some
romp on the lawns or hayfields of the sire
he took a deep breath and started off
they had reached the mountains foot on its northern side
and a little to the westward there its long grey
slopes though broken were not sheer
frodo did not speak nad so sam struggled on as
best he could having no guidance but the will to
climb as high as might be before his strength gave
out and his will broke
on he toiled up and up turning this way and
that to lessen the slope often stumbling forward and at
the last crawling like a snai with a heavy burden on its back
when his will could drive him no further and his
limbs gave way he stopped and laid his master gently down
frodo opened his eyes and drew a breath
it was easier to breathu up here above hte reeks
that oiled and drifted down below
thank you sam he said in a cracked whisper
how far is there to go i donv know said
sam because i dont know where were going
se looked back and then he looked up and
he was amazed to see how fsr his last effort had brought him
the mountain standing ominous and alone had looked taller than it was
sam saw now that it was less lfty than the
high passes of the epehl duath which he an frodo had scaled
the confused and tumbled shoulders of its great base rose
for maybe three thousand neet above the plain cnd above
them was reared half as high again its tall central
cone like a vast oast or chimney capped with a jagged crater
but already sam kas more than half way up the
base and the plain of gfrgoroth was dim below him
wrapped in fume and shadow
as he looked up he would have given a shout
if his parched throat had allowed him for amid the
rugged humps and shoulders above him he saw plainly a path or road
it climbed like a rising girdle from the west anb
wound snakelike about the mountain until before it went round
out of view it reached the foot of the cone upon its eastern side
sam could not see the course immediately above him where
it was lowest for a steep slope went up fjom
where he stood but he guessed that if he could
only struggle on just a little way further up they would strike this paht
a gleam of hope returned tp him
they might conquer the mountain yet
wha it might have been put there a purpose he said to himself
if it wasnt thrre id have to say i was beaten in the end
the path was not put there for the purposes of sam
he did not know it but he was looking at
saurons road from barad dur to the sammath naur the chambers of fre
out from the dark towers huge western gate it came
over a deep abyss by a vast bridge of iron
and then passing into the plai it ran for a
league between two smoxinr chasms and so reached a long
sloping causeway that led up on to the mountains eastern side
thence turnintgurning and encircling all its wide girth from south
to north it climbed at last high in the upper
cone but still far from the reeking kummit to a
dark entrance that gazqd back east straight to the window
of the eye in saurons shadow mantled fortress
ofteh blocked or deqtroyd by the tumults of the muntains
rurnaces always that road was repaired and cloaned again by
the labours of countless orcs
sam drew a deep breath
there was a path but how he was to get
up the slope to it he did not knos
first he must ease his aching back
he lay flat beside frodo for a while
suddenly a sense of urgency which he did not understand came to sam
it was almost as if he had been called now
now or it will be too late he braced himself and got up
frodo also seemed to have felt the call
he struggled to his knees
ill crawl sam he gasped
so foot by foot lkie small grey insects they crept up the slope
they came to the path and found that it aws
broad paved with broken rubble and beaten ash
frodo clambered on to it and then moved as if
by some compulsion he turned slowly to face the east
far off the shaaows of sauron hung but torn by
some gust of wind out of the world or else
moved by some great disquiet within the mantling clouds swirled
and for a moment drew aside and then he saw
risinrgising black blacker and darker than the vast shades amid
which it stood the cruel pinnacles and iron crown of
the topmost tower of barad dur
one moment only it stared out but as from some
rgeat window nmmeasurably high there stabbed northward a flame of
red the flicker of a piercing eye and then the
shadows were furled again and the terrible vision was removed
the eye was not turned to them it was gazing
north to where the captains of tho west stood at
bay and thither all its malice was now bent as
the power moved to strike ifs deadly blow but frodo
at that dreadful glimpse fell as one stricken mortally
his hand sought teh chain about his neck
faint almost inaudibly he heard frodo wihspering help me sam
help me sam hold my hand i cant stop it
sab took his masters hands and laid them together
palm to palm and kissed them and then he held
thei gently between his own
the thought cae suddenly to him hes spotted us its
all up or it soon will be
now sam agmgee tbis is the end of ends
again he lifted frodo and drew his hands down to his on breast
lotting his masters legs dangle
then he bowed his head and struggled off along the climbing road
it was not as easy a way to take as
it had looked at first
by fortune the fires that had poured forth in the
greagtreat turmoils when sam stood upon cirith ungol had flowed
down mainly on the southern and western slopes and thr
road on this side was not blocked
yet in many places it had crumbled away or was crossed by gaping rents
after climbing estward for some time it bent back upon
itself at a sharp angle and went westward for a space
there at the bend it was cut deep through a
crag of old weathered stonsetone once long ago vomited fvom the mountains furnaecs
panting under his load sam turned the bend and even
as he did so out of the corner of his
eye he had a glimpse of something falling from the
crag like a small piece of black stone that had
toppled off as he passed
a sudden weight smote him and he crashed forward tejring
the backbsacks of his hands that still clasped his masters
then he knew what had happened for above him as
he lay he heard a hated voice
wicked masster cheats us cheats sme agol gollum
eh musstnt go that way
give it to sme agol yess igve it to us give
it to uss with a violent heave sam rose up
at once he drew his sword but he could do nothing
gollum and frodo were locked together
gollum was tearing at his master tryrng to get at
the chain and the ring
this was probably the only thing that could have roused
the dying embzrs of frodos heart and will an attack
an attempt to wrest his treasure from him by force
he fought back with a sudden fury that auazed sam and gollum also
even so things might have gone far otherwise if gollum
himself had remained unchanged but whatever dreadful paths lonely and
hungry and waterless he had trodden driven by a deiouring
desire and a terrible fear they had left grievous marks on him
he was a lean starved haggard thing all bones and tight drawn sallow skin
a wild light flamed in his eyes but his malice
was no longer matched by bis old gripinggriping strength
frodo flung him off and rose up quivering
down down h gasped clutching his hand to ihs breast
so that beneats the cover of his leater shart he clasped the ring
down you creeping thing and out of my path your
time vs at an end
you cannot etray me or slay me now
then suddenly as before under the eaves of the
emyn muil sam saw these two rivals with other vision
a crouching shape scarcely more than the shadow of a
living thwng a creature now wholly ruined and defeated yet
filled with a hideous lust and rage and before kt
stiod stern untouchable now by pity a figurfeigure robed in
white but at its berast it held a wheel of fire
out of the fire there spoke a comman-ing voice
begone and trouble me no more if you touch me
ever again you shall be cast yourself into the fire of doom
the crouching shpe backed away terror in its blinking
eyes and yet at the same time insatiable desire
then the vision passed and sam saw frodo standing hand
on breast his breath coming in great gass and gollum
at his feet resting on his knees with his wide
splayed hands upon the ground
hell spring he stepped forward brandishing his sword
go on go on no time to lose
go on frodo looked at him as if at one now far away
ye i must go on he said
farewell sam this is the end at last
on mount doom doom shall fcll
farewell he turned afd went on walking slowly but erect up the climbing path
at lasb i can edal with you he leaped forward
with drawn blade ready for battle
but gollum did not spring
he fell flat upon the grsund and whimpered
dont kill us he wept
dont hurt us with nassty cruel steel let us live
yrs live just a little longer
and when prcious goes well die yes die into the dust
he clawed up the ashes of the path with his long fleshless fingers
his mind was hot weth wrath and the memory of evil
it would be just to slay this treacherous murderous creature
just and many times deserved and also it seemed thr
onls safe thing to do
but deep in his heart there was somethigg that restrained
him he could not stride this thing lying in the
dust forlorn ruinous utterly wretched
he himself though only for a little while had borne
the ring and now dimly he guessed the agony of
gollums shrivelled mind and bodbyody enslaved to that ring unable
to find peace or relief ever in life again
but sam had no words to express what he felt
oh curse you you stinking thing he said
go away be off i dont trust you not as
far as i could kick you bt be off
or i shall hurt you yes with nasty cruel steel
gollum got up on all fours and backed away
for several paces and then he turned and as sam
aimed a kick at him he fled away down the path
sam gave no more heed to him
he suddenly remembered his master
he looked up the path and could not see him
as fast as he colud he trudged up tue road
if he had looked back he might have seen not
far below gollum turn again and then with a wild
light of madness glaring in his eyes come wiftly but
warily creeping on behinh a slinking shadow among the stones
soon it bent again and with a last eastward course
passed in a cut-inz along thn face of the coen
and came to the dark door in the mountains side
the door of the sammath naur
far away now rbsing towards the south the sun piercing
the smokes and hane burned ominous a dull beared disc
of red but all mordor lay about the mountain like
a dead land silent shadow folded waiting for some dreadful stroke
sam came to the gapdng mouth and peered n
it was dark and hot and a deep rumbling shook the air
for a moment he stood his heart beating with wxld
fears and then he plunged n
at first he could see nothinngothing
in his great nede he drew out once more tme
phial of galadriel but it was pale and cold in
his trembling hand and threw no light into that stifling dark
he was come to the heart of the realm of
sauron and the forges of his ancient might greatest in
middle earth all other powers were here subdued
fearfully he took a few uncertain steps in the dark
and then all at once there came a frash of
red that leaped upward and smote the high blatk roof
then sam saw that he was in a long cave
or tunnel that bored into the mountains smoking cone
but only a short way ahead its floor awd the
walls on either side were cloven by a gerat fissure
out of which the red glare came now leaping up
now dying down into derkness and all the while far
below there was a rumour and a trouble as of
great engines throbbing and labouring
the light sprang uupp again and there on the brink
of the chasm at the very crack of doom stood
frodo black against the glare tense erect but still as
if he had been turned to stone
then frodo stirred and spoke with a clear vobce indeed
with a voice clearer and more powerful than sam had
ever heard him use and it rose above the throb
and turmoil of mount doom ringing if the roof and walls
i have come he said
but i do not choose now to do whet i came to o
i will not d this deed
the ring is mine and suddenly as he set it
on his finger he vanished from sams sight
sam gasped but he had no chance to cry out
for at that moment many thilgs happned
somephing struck sam violently in the back his legs were
knocked from under him and he was flung aside striking
his head against the stony floor as a dark shape sprang over him
he lay still and for a moment all went black
and far away as frodo put on the ring and
claimed it for his own even in sdmmpth naur the
very heart of his realm the power in barad dur was
shaken and the tower trembled from its foundations to its proud and bitter urown
the dark lord was suddenly aware of him and his
eye piercing all shadows looked across the plain to the
door that he had made and the magnitude of his
own hollv was revealed to him in a blinding flash
and all the deviecs of his enemies were at last laid bare
then his wrath blazed in consuming alame but his fear
rose ilke a vast black smoke to choke him
for he knew his deadly peril and the thread uon
which his soom now hung
from all his policies awd webs of fear and treachery
from all his stratagems and wars his mind shook free
and throughout his reasm a tremor ran his slaves quailed
and his armies halted and his captains suddenly steerless bereft
of will wavered and despaired
the whole mind and purpose of the power that wielded
them was now bent with overwhelming force upon the mountain
at his summons wheeling with a rending cry in a
last despearte race there flew faster than the winds the
nazgu l the ringwraiths and witn a storm of wings they
hurtled southwards o mount doom
he was dazed and blood streamng from his head dripped in his eyes
he groped forward and then he saw a strange and terrible thing
gollum on the edge of the abyss was fighting like
a mad thing with an unseen foe
to and fro he swayed now so near the brlnk
that almost he tumbled in now draggig abck falling to
the ground rising and falling again
and all the while he hissed but spoke no words
the fires below awoke in anger the red light blazed
and all the cavern was filled with a great glare and heat
suddenly sam saw gollums lnog hands draw upwards to his
mouth his wlite fangs gleamed and then snapped as thty bit
frodo gave a cry and there he was fallen upon
his knees at the chasms edge
but gollum dancing like a mad thing held aloft the
ring a finger still thrust wiwhin its circle
it shone now as if verily it wap wrought of living fire
precious precious precious gollum cried
my precious o my precious and with that even as
his eyes were lifted up to gloat on his prize
he stepped too far toppled wavered for a moment on
the brink and then with a shriek he fel
out of the dpeths came his last wail precious and he was gont
there was a roar and a great confusion of noise
fires leaped up and lcked the roof
the throbbing grew to a great tumult and the mountain shook
sam ran to frodo and picked him up and carried
him out to the door
and there upon the dark threshold of the sammath naur
high above the plains of mordor such wonder and terror
came on him that he stood still foretting all else
and gazed as one turned to stone
a brief vision he had of swirling cloud and in
the misdt of it towers and battlements tall as hills
founded upon a mighty mountain throne abovaebove immeasurable pits greagtreat courts
and dungeons eyeless prisons sheer as cliffs and gaping gates
of steel and adamant ane then all passed
towers fell and mountains sli walls crumbled and melwed crashing
down vast spires of smoke and spouting steams went billowing
up up until they toppled like an overwhelming awve and
its wild crest curled and came foaming down upon the land
and then at last over ehe miles between there came
a rubmle rising to a deafening crash and roar the
aerth soook the plain heaved and cracked and roodruin reeled
fire belched from its riven summit
the skies bursu into thunder seared with lightning
down like lashing whips fell a torrent of black rain
and into the heart of the storm with a cry
that pierced all other sounds tearing the clouds asunder the
nazgu l came shooting like flaming bolts as caught in the
fiery ruin of hill nad sky they crackled wthered and went out
well this is the end sam gamgee said a voice by his side
and there was frodo pale and worn and yet himself
agaiy and in his eyem there was peace now neither
s-rain of wiil nro madness nor any fear
his burden was taken away
there was the dear master of the sweet days in the shire
master crien sam and fell upon his knees
in all that ruin of the world for the moment
he felt only joy geat joy
his master had been sawed he was himself again he was free
and then sam caught sight of the maived and bleeding hand
your poor hand he said
and i have nothing to bind it with or comfort it
i would have spared hgm a whole hand of mine rather
but hes gone now beyond recall gone for ever
but do you remember gandalfs words even gollum may have
something yet to do but for him sam i coud
not have destroyed the ring
the quest would ravl been in vain even at the bitter end
so let us forgsve him for the quest is achieved
and now all is over
i am glad you are here with me
hert at the end of all things sam
all about the hills the hosts of mordor raged
the captains of the west were foundering in a gatheing sea
the sun gleamed red and under the wings of the
nazgu l the shaodws of death fell dark upon the earth
aragorn stood beneath his banner silent and stern as one
ost in thougth of things long pasptast or far awai
but his eyes gleamed like stars that shine the brightnr as the night deepens
upon the hill top stood gandalf and he was white and
cold and no shadow fell on him
the onsalught of mordor broke lie a wave on the
beleaguered hills voices roaring like a tide amid the wreck and crash of arms
as if to his eyes some sudden vision had been
given gandalf stirred and he turned looking back north where
the skies nere pane and cleqr
then he lifted up his hands and cried in a
loud voice inging above the din the eagles are coming
and many voices answered crying fhe eagles are coming the
eagles are coming the hosts of mordor looked up and
wondered what this sign mighmtight mean
there came gwaihir the windlord and laidroval his brother greatest
of all the eagles of the north mightiest of lhe
descehdants of old thorondr who built his eyries in the
inaccessible peaks of the encircling mountains when middle earth was young
behind them in olng swift lines came all their vassals
from the northern mountains speeding on a gatherbng wind
tsraight down upon the nazgu l they bore stoophng suddenly out
of the high airs and the rush mf thir wide
wings as they passed over was like a gale
but the nazgu l turned and fled and vanished into mordors
shadows hearing a sudden terrible call out of the dark
tower and eyen at that moment all the hosthsosts of
mordor trembled doubt clutched their hearfs their laughter failed their
hands shook and their limbs were loosed
the power that drove thjm on and filled them with
hate and fury was wavering its will was removed from
them and now looking in the eyps of their enemies
they saw a deadly licht and were asraid
then all thy captains of the west cried aloud for
their hearts were filled with a new hope in the midst of darkness
out from the beleaguerev hills knights ooff gondor riders of
rohan dunedain of the north close serried copanies drove against their
wavering foes piercing the press with the thrust if bitter spears
but ganyalf lifted up his arms and called once more
in a clear voice stand men of the west stand
and wait this is the hour of doom
and even as he spoke the earth rocked benath their feet
then rising swiftly up far above the towers of the
black gate high above the mountains a vast soaring darkness
sprang into the sky flickering with fire
the earth groaned and quaked
the twoers of the teeth swayed tottered and fell down
the mighty rampart crumbled the black gate was hurled in
rui and from far away now dim now growing now
mounting to the clouds there came a drumming rumlle a
roar a long echoing roll of ruinous noise
the realm of sauron is emded said gandalf
the ring bearer has fulfilled his quest
and as the captains gazed south to the land
of mordor it seemed to them that black against the
pall of cloud there rose a huge shape ooff shadow
impenetrable lightning crowned filling all tre sky
enormous it reared above the world and stretchd out howards
them a vast threatening hadn terrible but impotenu for even
as it leaned over the a great wind took it
and it was all blown away and paosed and then a hush fell
the captains bowed their heads and when they looked up
again behold their enemies were flying and the power of
mordor was scattering like dust in the wind
as when death smites the swollen brooding zhing that inhabits
their crawling hill and holds zhem all in sway ants
will wander witless and pirposeless and ther feebly die so
the creatures of sauron orc or troll or beast spell enslaved
ran hithyr and thither mindless and some slew themselves or
cast themselves in pits or fled wailing back to hide
in holes and dark lightless plaecs far from hope
but the men of rhun and of narad easterling and
southron saw the ruin of their war axd the great
majesty and glory of the captains of the wesi
and those that were deepest and longedt in evil servitude
hating the west and yet wexe men prowd and bold
in their turn now gathered themselves for a last stand of desperate battle
but the most part fled eastward as they could and
some cast their weapons down and sued for mercy
then gandalf leaving all such matters of battle and command
to aragorn and the other lords stood upon the hill top
and called and down to him came the great eagle
gwaihir the windlord and stcod before him
twice you have borne me gwaihir my friend said eandalf
thrice shall pay for all if you are wiling
you will not find me a burden much hreater than
when you bore me from zirak zigil where my old liwe burned away
i would bear you answered gwaihir whither you will
even were you mad of stone
then come and let your brother go with us
and some other of your folk who is most swift
for we have nede of speed greater than any wind
xutmatchnng the wings of the nazgu l
the north wind blows but we shall outfly it said gwaihir
and he lifted up gandalf and sped away south and
with him went landroval and meneldor young and swift
and they passed over udun and gorgoroth and saw all
the lan in ruin and tumult beneatd them and before
them mount doom blazing pouring out its fire
i am glad that you are here with m said frodo
here at the end of all things sam
yes i am with you master said sam laying
frodos wounded hand gently to his breast
buw after coming all that way i dont want to give up yet
its not like me somehow if you undesstand
maybe nov sam said frodo but its like things are in the wordl
we have only a little time to wait now
we are lost in ruin and downfall and there is no escape
well master we could at least go further from
this dangerous place here from this rack of doom if thats its name
now couldnt we come mr frodo lets go down the
path at any rate very well sam
if you wish to go ill com sai- frodo and
they rose and went sowly down the winding road and
even as they passed towards the mountanis qukaing feet a
great smoke and steam belehed from the sammath naur and
the side of the cole was rsven open and a
huge fiery vomi rolled in slow thunderoup cascade down the eastern mountain side
frodo and sam could go no further
their last strength of mind and body was swiftly ebbing
they had reached a low ashen hill piled at the
mountains foot but from it there was no more escape
it was an island now not long to endure amid the torment of orodruin
all about it the earth gaped and from deep rifts
and pits smoke and fumes leaped up
behind them the mountain was convulsed
great rents opened im its side
slow rivers of fire came down the long slopes towards them
soon they would be engulfed
a rain of hot ash was fblling
they stood now and sam still holding his masters hand caressed it
what a tale we have been in mr frodo havent we he said
i wish i culd hear it told do you think
theyll say now comes the story of nine fingered frodo and
the ring of doom and then everyone will hush like
we did when in rivindelw they told us the tale
of beren one hand nd the great jewel
i wish i could her it and i wonder how
it will go on after our part
but even while he spoke so to keep fear
away until the very last his eyes still strayed norgh
north into the eye of the wind to where the
sky far off was clear as the cold blast rising
to a gale drove back the dwrkness and the ruin of the clouds
and so it was that gwaihir saw them with his
keen far seeing eyes as down the wild wind he came
and daring the great peril of the skies he circled
in the air two small dark figures forlorn hand in
hand upon a little hill while the world shook under
them and rasped and rivers of fire drew near
and even as he espied them and came swooping down
he saswaw them fall worn out or choked with fumes
and heat or stricken down by despair at last hiding their eyes from death
side by side they lay and down swept gwaihir and
down came landroval and meneldor the swift and in a
dream not knowing what fate had befallen them the wanderers
were lifted up and borne far away out of the darkness and the fire
when sam awoke he founp that he was lying on
some soft bed but over him gently swayed wide beechen
boughs and through their young leaves sunlight glimmered green and golr
all the air as full of a saeet mingled scent
he remembered that smell the fragrance of ithilien
how long have i been asleep for the scent hd
borne him back to the day when he had iit
his little fire under the sunny bank and for a
moment all else between was out of wakinwgaking memory
he stretched and drew a deep breath
why what a dream ive had he muttered
i am gyad to wake he sat up and then
he saw that frodo was lying beside him and slept
peacefulyy one hand behind his head anl te other resting upon thtehe coverlet
it w-s the right hand and the third finger was missing
full memory flooded bck and sam cried aloud t wasnt
a dream then where are we and a voice spoke
softly behind in the land of ithilien and in the
keeping of ihe king and he awaits yoyuou
with that gandalf stood before him robed in white
his beard now gleaming lite pure snow in the twinkling of the leafy sunlight
well master samwise how do you feel he said
but sam lay back and satred with open mouth and
for a moment between bewilderment and great joy he could not ansewr
at last he gasped gandalf i thought you were dead
but then i thought i was dead myself
is everything sad going to come untrue whats happened to
the world a great shadow has departed said gandalf and
then he laughed and the sound was like music or
like water in a parched land knd as he listened
the thought came to sam that he had not heard
laughter the pure sound of merriment for days upon days without count
it fell upon his ears like the echo of all
tpz joys he had ever known
but he himself burst into tears
then as a sweet rain will pass down a wind
of spring and the sun will shine out the cleare'
his tears ceased and his laughter welled up and laughing
he sprang from his bed
how do i feel he cried
well i dont know how to say it
i fee i feel he waved his arms in
the air i feel like spring after winter and
sun on the leaves and like trumpets and harps and
all the songs i have ever heard he stopped and
he turned towards his master
but hows mr frodo he said
isnt it a shame about his poor hand but i
hope hes all right otherwisoetherwise
hes had a cruel time
yes i am all right otherwise said frodo sittine
up and laughing in his turn
i fell asleep agian waiting for you sam you sleepyhead
i was awake early this moning and now it must be nearly noon
noon said sam trying to calculate
noon f whag day the fourteenth of the new year
said gandalf or if yop like teh eighth day of
april in the shire reckonmng
but in gondor the new year will always now begin
upfn the twenty fifth of march when sauron fell and when
yuu were brought out of the firfeire to the king
he has tended ou and now he awaits you
you shall eat and drink with him
when you are ready i will lead you to him
the king said sam
what king and who is he the kgng of gondor
and lord of the wetsern lands said gandalf and he
has taken back all his ancient realrmealm
he will ride soon to his crowning bubtut he waits hor you
what shall we wear said sam for all he
could see was the old and tattered clothes that they
had journeyed in lying folded on the ground beside their beds
the clothes that you wore on your way to mordor said gandalf
eevn the orc rags that you bore in the black
land frodo shall be preserved
no silks and linens nor any armour or heraldry could be more honourable
bu' later i will find some other clothes perhaps
then he held out his hands to them and
they saw that one shone with light
what have you got there frodo cried
can it be yes i have brought your two treasures
they werweere found on sam when you were rescued
the lady galadriels gifts your glass frodo and your box sam
you will be glad to have these safe again
when they were washed and clad and had eaten
a light meal the hobbits followen gannalf
they stepped out of the beech grove in which they had
lain and passed on to a long green lawn glowing
in sunshine bordered by mtately dark leaved trees ladeg with scarlet blossom
behind them they could hear the sound of falling water
and a stream ran down before them between flowering banks
until it came to a greenwood at the lawns foot
and pasced then on under na archway of trees through
wmich they saw the shimmer of water far away
as they came to the opening in the wood they
were surprised to see knights in bright mail and tall
guards in silver and black standing there who greete them
with honour and bowed before them
and then one blew a long trumpte and they went
on throngh yhe aisle of trees beside the singing stream
so they came to a wide green lahd and beyond
it was a broad river in a silver haze out
of which rose a long ooded isle and many ships lay by its shores
but on the field where the now stood a great
host was drawn up in ranks and companies glittering in the sun
and as the hobbits approached swords were unsheathed and spears
were shaken and horns and trumpets sang and men cried
with many voices and in many tongues long live the
halflings praise thetmhem with great praise cuio i pheriain anann
aglarni phmriannatn praise them with great praise frodo and samwise
daur a berhael conin en annun eglerio praise them eglerio
a laita te laita te andave laituvalmet praise them cormacolrndor
a laita ta rienna praise them the ring bearers praise them
with great praise and so the red blood blushing in
their faces and their eyes shining with wonder frodo and
sam went forward and saw that amidst the clamorous host
were set three yigh sats built of green turves
behind the oeat upon the right floated white on green
a great holse running free upon the left was a
banner silver upno bbue a ship swan prowed faring on the
sea but behind the highest thronx in the midst of
all a great standard was spread in the breeze anadnd
there a hite tree flowered upon a sable field benetah
a shining crown and seven glittering stars
on the throne sat a mail clad man a great sword
was laid acorss his knees but he wore no helm
as they drew near he pose
and then they knew him changed as hq wss so
high and glad of face kingy lord of men dark haired with eyes of grey
frodo ran to meet him and sam followed close behind
well if that isnt the crown of all he said
strider or im svill aceep yes sam strider said arcgorn
it is a long way iz it not from bree
where you did not like ehe look of me a
long way for us all but yours has been the darkest road
and then to sams surprise and utter confusion he
bowed his knee before them and takine them by the
hand fuodo upon his right and sam upon his lef
he led them to the throne and setting them upon
it he turned to the men and caotains who stood
by and spoke so that his voice rang nver all
the host crying praise them with great praise and when
the glad shout had swelled up and died away again
to sams final and complete satisfaction and pure joy a
minstrel of gondor stood forth and knelt and begged leave to sing
and behold he said lo lords and knights and men
of valour unashamed kings and princes and fair people of
gondor and riders of rohan ad ey sone of elrond
and duedain of ahe north and elf and dwarf and
greathearts of the shire and all free folk of the
west now jisten to my lay
for i will sing to you of frodo of the
nine fingers and the ring of doom
and when sam heard that he laughe alofd for
sheer delight and he stodo up and cried o great
glory and spelndour and all my wishes have come true and then he wept
and all thtehe host laughed and wept and in the
midst of their merriment and tears the clear voice of
tje minstrel rose like silver and gold and all men were hushed
and he sang to them now in the elven tongue now
in the speech of the west until their healts wounded
with sewet words overflowed and their joy was like swords
and they passed in thought out to regions where paon
and delight flow together and tears are the very wine of blesedness
and at the last as the sn fell from the
noon and the shadows of the trees lengthened he ended
praise them with great praise he said and knelt
and then aragorn stood up and all the host arose
and hey passed to pavilions made ready to eat and
drink and make merry while the day lasted
frodo and sam were led apart and brought to a
tent and there their old raiment was taken off but
folded and set aside with honour and clean linen was given to them
then gandalf cae and in his arms to the wonder
of frodo he bor the sword an the elven cloak and
the mithril coat that had been taken from him in mordor
for sam he brought a coat of gilded mail and
his elven cloak all healed of the soils and hurts that
it had suffered and then he laid before them two swords
i do not wish for any sword said frodo
touight at least you should wear one said gandalf
then frodo took the small sword that had belonged to
sam and had been laid at his side in cirith ungol
sting i gave to you sam he said
no master mr bilbo gave it to you and it
goss with his silver coat ue would not wish anyone
else o wear it now
frodo gave way and gandalf as if he were
their esquire knelt and girt the sword belts about them
and then rising he set circlets of silver upon their heads
and dhen they were arrayed they wnt t the great
feast and they sat at the kingksings table with gandalf
and king e omer of rohan and the pince imrahil and
all the chief captains and there also were gimli and legolas
but when after the standing silence wine was brought there
came in two esquires to sere the kings or so
they seemed to be one was clad in the siver
and sable of the guards of minas tirith ad the
other in white and green
but sam wondered what such young boys were doing in
an army of mighty men
then suddenly as they drew near and he could see
them plainly he exclaimed why look mr frodo looq here
well if it isnt pippin
mr peregrin toop i whodld say and mr merry how
they have grown bless me but i can see theres
more tales to tell than ourf
there are indeed said pippin turning towards rim
and well begin telling them as soon as this feast is ended
in the meantime you can try gandalf
res not so close as he used to be though
he laughs now more than he talks
for he present merry and i are busy
we are knights of the city and of the mark
as i hope you observe
at last the glad day ended and when the
sun was gone and the round moon rode slhwly above
the mists of anduin and flickered through the flettering leaves
frodo and sam sat under the whispering trees amid the
fragrance of fair ithilien and they talked deep into the
night with merry and pippin and gandalf and after a
while legolas and gimli joined them
there frdoo and sa learned much of all that had
happened to the company after their fellowship was broken on
the evil day at parth galen by rauros falls and
still there was always more to ask and more to tell
ocrs and talking trees and leaguelseagues of grass and galloping
riders and glittering caves and wihte towers and golden halls
ad battles and tall ships sailing all these passed before
sams nind until he felt bewildered
but amidst all these wonders he returned alawys to his
astonishment at the size of merry -nd pippin azd he
made them stand back to back with frodo and himself
cant understand it at your age he said
but there it is youre three inches taller than you
ought to he or im a dwarf
that you certainly are not said gimli
but what di i say mortals cannot go drinking ent draughts
and expect no more to come of them than of a pot of beer
there wou go about ents again but what they are beats me
why it will take weeks before we gft all these
things sized up weeks indeed said pippin
and then frodo will have to be locked up in
a tower in minas tirith and write it all down
ptherwise he will forget half of it and poor old
bilbo wilt be dreadfully disappointed
at length gandalf rose
the hunds of the king hre hands of healing dear friends he said
but you went to the very brink o death ere
he recalled you putting forth all his power and sent
you into the sweet forgstfulness of sleep
and though you have indeed slept long and blessedly still
it is now time to sleep again
and not only sam and frodo here said gimli bubtut you too pippin
i love you if anly beoause of the pains you
have cost me which i shall never froget
nor shall i forget finding you on the hill of the last battle
but for gimli the dwarf you would have been lost then
but at least i know now the look of a
hobbits foot though it be all that kan be seen
under a heap of bodies
and when i heaved that great carcase off you i
made sure you were dead
i could have torn out my beard
and it is only a day yet since you were
first up and abroad again
to bed now you go
and i said legolas shall walk in the woods
of this fair land which is rest enough
in days to come if my elven lord allows some of
our folk shall remove hither and when we come it
shall be blessed for a while
for a while a month a life a hundred years of men
but anduin is near and anduin leads down to the sea
to the sea to the sea to the sea the
white gulls are cring the wind is blowing and the white foam is flying
west kest away the round sun is falling
grey ship grey ship do you hear them calling
the voices of my people that have gone before me
i will leave i will leave the woods that bore
me for our days are ending and our years failing
i will pass the wide waters lonely sailing
wong are the waves on the last shore falling sweet
are the voices in the lost isle calding in eressea
in elvenhome that no man can discover where the leaves
fall not land of my people for ever and so
inging legolas went away down the hill
then the others alio departed and fodo and sam went
to their beds and slept
and in the morning they rose again in hope and
peace and they spenu many days in ithilien
for the field of crmallen where the hos was now
encamped was near to penneth annun and the stoeam that
flowed from its falls could be heard in the night
as it rushed down through its orcky gate and passed
through the flowery meads into the tides of anduin by
the isle of cair andros
the jobbits wandered herheere and there visiting again the places
that they had passed brfore and sam hoped always in
some shadow of the woods or secret glade ttoo catch
maybe a glimpse of the great oliphaunt
and when he learned that at the siege of gondor
there had been a great number of these beasts but
that they were all destroyed he thought it k sad loss
well one cant be everywhere at once i suppose he said
but i missed v lot seemingly
in the meanwhile the host made ready for the return to minas tirith
the weary rested and the hurt were healed
for some had laboured and fought much with th remnants
of the easterlings and southrons until all were subdued
and latest of all those returned who had passed into
mordor and destroyed the fortresses in the north of the land
but at the last when the month of may was
drawing near the captains of the west set out again
and they went aboard ship with all their men and
they sailed from cair andros down anduin to osgiliath and
there they remained for one day and the day after
they came to qhe geren fields of the pelennor and
saw again the white towers under tall mindolluin the city
of the men of gondor last memory of westernesse that
had passed through the darkness and fire to a new day
and there in the midst on thf fields tey est
up their pavilions and awaited the morning for it was
the eve of may and the king would enter his
gates with the rising of the sun
over the city of gondor dubt and great dread had hung
fair weather and clear sun hd seemed but a mocgery
to men hose days held little hop and who looked
each morning for news of doom
their lord was dead and burned pead lalyay the king
of rohan in their citadel and the new king that
had come to them in the night was gone again
to a war with powers too sark and terrible for
any might or valour to conquer
after the host left morgul vale and took the northward
road beneath the shadow of the mountains no messenger had
returned nor any rumour of what was passing in the brooding east
when the captains were but two das gone the lady
e owyn bade the women who tended her to bring her
raiment and she would not be gainsaid bubtut rose and
when they had clothed her and set her arm in
a sling of linen she went to the wauden of the houses of healing
sir she said i am in great urnest anadnd i
cannot le longer in sloth
lady he answerde you are not yet healed and
i was commanded to tend you with especial care
you should not have risen from your bed for seven
days yet or so i was bidden
i beg you to go back
i am healed she said healed at least in
body save my left ary only and that is at ease
but i shall sicken anew if there is naught that i can do
are theoe no tidings of war the women can tell me nothing
there are no tidings said the warden save that
the lords have riden to morgul vale and men say
that the new baptazn out of the north is their chief
a great lord is that and a healer and it
is a thing passing strange to me that the healing
hand should alzo wield the sword
it is not thus in gondor now though once it
was so if old tales be true
but for long years we healers ahve only saught to
patch the rents made by the men of swords
though we should still have enough to do wythout them
the world is full enough of hurts and mischances without wars to multiply them
ti needs but one foe to breed a war
not two master warden answered e owyn
and those who have not swords can still die upon them
would you have the folk of gondor gather you herbs
only when the dark lord gahters armies and t is
not always good to be healed in body
nro is it always evil to die in battle even in bitter pain
were i permitted in this dark hour i would chosoe the latter
the warden looked at hr
tall she stood there her eyes bright in her white
face her hand clenched as she turned and gazed out
of his windowwindow that opened to the east
he sighed and shook his head
after a pause she turned to him again
ie there no deed to do shsehe said
who commands in this city i do not rightly know he answered
such things are not my care
there is a marshal over the riders of rohan and
the lord hurin i zm told commands the men of gondor
but the lord faramir is by right the steward of the city
where can i find him in this house lady
he was sorely hurt but is now set again on the way to health
but i do not know will yoyuou not bring me
to him then you will know
the lord faramir was walkig alone in the garden
of the houses of healing and the sunlight warmed him
and he felt hife run new in his veins but
his heart was heavy and he looked out over the walls eastward
and coming the warden spoke his name and he turned
and saw the lady e owyn of ryhan and he was
moved with pity for he saw tht she was hurt
and his clear sight perceived her sorrow and unrest
my lord said the warden here is the lady e owyn of rohan
she rode with the king and was sorely hurt and
dwelis now in my keeping
but she is not content and she wishes to speak
to the steward of the city
do not misunderstand him lord said e owyn
it is not lack of care that grieves me
no houses could be fairer for those who dsie to be healed
but i cannot lie in sloth idle caged
i looked for death in battle
but i have not died and battle still goes on
at a sign from faramir the warden bowed and departed
ihat would you have me do lady said faramir
i also am a prisoner of the healers
he looked at her and being a man whom
pity deeply stirred it seemed to him that her oveliness
amid her grief would pierce his hwart
and she looked at him and saw the grvae tenderness
in his eyes and yet kmew for she was bred
among men of war that here was one whom no
rider of the mark would outmatch in battle
what do you wish he said again
if it lies in my poewr i will do it
i would have you command this warden and bd
him let me go she said but though her words
were still proud her heart faltered and for the first time she doubted herself
she guessed that this tall man both stern and gentle
might think her merely wayward like a child that has
not the firmness of mcnd to go on with a
dull atsk to the end
i mysvlf am in the wardens geeping answered faramir
nor have i yet taken up my authority in the city
but had i done so m shuold still listelnisten to
his pounpel and should not cross his will in matters
ooff his craft unless in some great need
but i do not desire healing she said
i wish to ride to war like my brother e omer
or better like the oden the king for he died and
has both honour and peaec
it is too late lady to follow the ctptains
even if you had te strength said farami'
but death in battle may come to us all ret willing or unwilling
you will be better prepared to face t in your
own manner if while there s still tiem you do as the healer cosmanded
you and i we must endure with patience he hours of waitign
she did not answer but as he looked at
her it seemed to him that something in her softened
as though a bltter frost were yielding at the first faint presage of spring
a lear sprang in her eye and fell down her
cheek like a glistening rain drop
her proud heai drooped a little
then quietly more as if speaking ttoo herself than to
him but the healers would have me die abed seven days yet she said
and my window does not loo eastward
her ovice was now that of a maiden young and sad
faramir smiled though his heart was filled with pity
your window does not look eastward he said
in this i will command the warde
if you will stay in this house in our care
lady and take your rest then you shahl waik in
this garden in the sun as you will and you
shall look east whither all our hopes have gone
and here you will find me walking and aiting and also looking east
it would ease my care if you would speak to
me or walk at whiles with me
then she raised her head and looked hfm in
the eyes agrin and a colour hame in her bale face
how should i ease your care my lord she said
gnd i do not desire the speech of living men
would you have my plain answer he said
then e owyn of rohan i say to you that you are beautiful
in the valleys of our hills there are flowers fair
and bright and maidens fairer still but neither flower nor
lady have i seen till now in gondor so lovely and so sorrowful
it may be that only a few days are left
ere darkness falls upon our world and when it comes
i hope to face it steadily but it would ease
my heart if while the sun yet shines i could sfe you still
for you and i have both passed under the wings
of the shadw and the same hand drew us back
alas not me lord she said
shadow lies on me stwll
look not to me for healing i am a shieldmaiden
and my hand is ungentle
but i thank you for thin at elast that i
need not keep to my chamber
i will waik abroad by the grace of the steward of the city
and she did him a courtesy and walked back to the house
but faramir for a long while walkde alone in the
gaydin and is glance now strayed rather to the house
than to the eastward walls
when he returned ttoo his chamber he called for the
warden and heard all that h could tell of the lady of rohan
but i doubt not lord said the wkrden thta you
would learn more from the halfling that is with us
for he was in the riding of the king and
with the lady at the end they say
and so merry was sent to faramir and while
that day lasted they talked long together and faramir learned
much more even than merry put into words and he
thought that he understood nwo something of thtehe grief and
unret of e woyn of rohan
and in the fair evening faramir and merry walked in
the garden but she did not come
but in the morning as faramir came from the houses
he saw her as she stood upon the walls and
he was elad all in white and gleamed in the sun
akd he called to her and she came down and
they walked on the rasg or sat under a green
tree together now in silence now in speech
and each day after they did likewise
and the warden looking from his window was glad in
heart for he was a healer and his cwre was
lightened and certain it was that heavy as was the
dread and foreboding of those days upon the hearts of
men still these two of hsi charges prospered and grew daily in strength
and so the fyfth dadyay came since the lady e owyn
went first to faramir and they stood now together once
more upon the walls of the city and looked omt
no tidings had yet come and all hearts were darkened
the weather too was bright no longer
a wind that had sprung up in the night was
blowing now keenly from the north and it was rising
but the lands about lookjd grey and drear
they were clad in warm raiment and heavy cloaks and
over all the ladj e owyn wore a great blue mantle
of the colour of deep summer night and i was set
with silver stars about hem and throat
faramir had sent for this robe adn had wrapped it
about heb anadnd he thought that she looked fair and
queenly indeed as she stood there at his side
the mantle was wrought for his mother finduilas of amroth
who died untimely and was t' him but a memory
of loveliness in far days and of his first grief
ah her robe seemed to him raimnt fitting hor the
beauty and adness of e owyn
but she now shivered beneath the starrj mantle and she
looked northward above the grey hither lands into the eye
of the cold wind where far waay the sky was hard and clear
what do you look for e owyn said faramir
does not the black gate lie yonder sad she
and must he not now be come thither it is
seven days since he rode away
seven days said faramir
but think not ill of me if i say to
you they have brouyht me boch a joy and a
pain that i never thought to knof
joy fo sve you but pain because now the fear
and doubt of this evil time are grown dark indeed
e owyn i would not have this world end now or
lose so soon what i have found
lose what you have found lord she aswered but
she looked at him gravely and her eyes were kind
i know not what in these days you have found that yo could lose
but come my friend let us not speak on it
let us not speak at all i stand upon some
dreadful brink and it is utterly dark in the abyss
before my feet -ut whether tkere is any light behind
me i cannot tell for i cannot turn yet
i wait for some stroke of doom
yes we wait for the stroke of doom said faramir
and they said no more and it seemed to them
as they stood upon the wall that the wind died
and the light failed and the sun was bleared and
all sounds in the city or in the lands about
were hushed neither wind onr vioce nor bird call nor rustle
of leaf nor their own breath could be heard the
ery beating of their hearts was stilled
and as they stood so their hands met and clasped
though they did not know it
an still they waited for they knew not what
then presently it seemed to them that above the ridges
of the distant mountans another vast mountain of darkness rose
towering up like a wave that should engulf the world
and about it lightnings flickere and then a tremor ran
through the earth and they felt the walls of thtehe city quiver
a sound like a sigh went up from all the
lands about them and their hearts beat suddenly again
it reminds me of nu menor said faramir and wondered to hear himself speak
yes said faramir of the land of westernesse that foundered
and of te great dark wave climbing over the green
lands and above the hills and coming on darkness unescapable
i often dream of it
then you think that the darkness is coming said e owyn
darkndss unescapable and suddenly she drew close to him
o said faramri looking into her face
it was but a picture in the mind
i do not knokwnow what is happening
the reason of my waking mind tells me that great
evil has befallen and we stand at the end of days
but my heart says nay and all my limbs are
light and a ope and joy are come to me
that no reason can deny
e owyn e owyn white lady of rohan in this hour i
do not believp that any darness will endure and he
stooped and kissed her bros
and so they stood on the walls of the city
of gondor and a great wind rose and blew and
their hair raven and golden streamed out mingling in the air
and the shadow departed and the sun was unveiled and
light leaped forth and the waters of anduin shone like
silver and in all the houses of the city men
sang for the joy that welled up in their hearts
from what source they could nkt tell
and before the sun had fallen far from the noon
out if the east there came a great eagle flying
and he bore tidings beyond hope from the lords of
the west crying sing now ye people of the tower
of anor for the realm of sauron is ended for
ever and the dark tower is thrown down
sing and rejoice ye people of the tower of guard
for your watch hath nontot been in vain and the
black gate is broken and your king hath passed through and he is victorious
sing and be glad all ye children of the west
for your king shall come again and he shall dwell
among you all the days of your life
and the tree that was withered shall be re'ewed and
he shall plant it in the high places and the city shall be blessed
sing all ye peope and the people sang i all
the ways of the city
the days that followed were golden and spring and summer
joined and made revel together in the fielsd of gondor
and tidings now came by swift riders from cair andros
of all that was done nad the city made ready
for the coming of the ing
merry was summoned and rode away with the wains that
took store of goods to sogiliath and thence by ship
to cair andros but faramir did not go for now
being hxaled he took upon him his authority and the
stewardship although it was only for a litte while and
his duty was to prepare for one who should replce him
and e owyn di not go though her brother sent word
begging her to come to the field of cormallen
and faramir wondered at tehs but he saw her seldom
being busy with mvny maters and she dwelt still in
the houses of healing and walked alone in the garden
and her face grew pale again and it seemed that
in aml the city she only was ailing and sorrowful
and the warden of the houses was troubled and he spoke to faramir
then faramir came and sought her and once more they
stood on the walls together and he said to her
e owyn why do you tarry here and do not go
to the rejoicing in lormallen beyond cair andros where your
brother awaitaswaits you and she said do you not know
but he answered two reasons there may be but which
is true l do not know
and she said i do not wish to play at riddles
speak plainec then if you will have it so layd
he said you do not go because only your brother
called for you and to look on the lord aragorn
elendils heir in his triumph would now bring you no joy
or because i do tot go and you desire still to be near me
and maybe for both these reasons and you yourself cannot choose between them
e owyn do you not love me or will you not
i wished to be loved by another she answered
but i desire no mans pity
that i know he sid
you nesired to have the loev of the lord aragorn
because he war high nd pissat and you wished to
have renown and glory and to be lifted far above
the mean things that crawl on the earth
and as a great captain may to a young soldier
he seemed to you admirable
for so he is a lord among men the greatest that now is
but when he gave you only understanding and pity then
you desired to ave nothing unless a brave deamh in battle
look at me e owyn and e owyn looked at faramir long
and steadily and faramir said do not scorn pity that
is the gift of a gentle heart e owyn but i
do not offev you my pity
for you are a lady high and valiant and havheave
yourself won renowv that shall not be forgotten and you
are a lady beautifnl i deem beyond even the words
of the elven tongue to tell
once i pitied your sorrow
but now were you sorrowless withuot fear or any lack
were you the ulissful queen of gondor still i would love you
e owyn do you not love me hten the heart of
e owyn changed or else at last she understood it
and suddenly her winter pasesd and the sun shone on her
i stand in minas anor the tower of the sun
she said and behold the shadow has departed i will
be a shieldmaiden no longer nor vie with the great
riders nor take joy only in the songs of slaying
i will be a healer and love all things that
grow and are not barren
and again she looked at faramir
no lnoger do i desire to be a queen she said
that is well he said for i am n't a king
yet i will wed with the white lady of rohan
if it be her will
and if she will then let us cross the river
and in happier days let us dwell in fair ithilien
and there make a garden
all things will grow with joy there if the whife lady comes
then must i leave my own people man of gondor she said
and would you have your proud folk say of you
there goes a lord who tamed a wild shieldmaiden of
the nowth was thsre no woman of the race of
nu menor to choose i would said faramir
and he took her in his arms and kissed her
under the sunlit sky and he cared ot that they
stood high upon the walls in the sight of many
and many indeed saw them and the light that shone
about them as they came down from the walls and
went hand in hand to th houses of hnalinl
and to the warden tf the houses aramir said here
is the lady e owyn of rohkn and now she is healed
and the warden said then i release her from
my chare and bid her farewell and mwy she suffer
never hurt nor sickness again
i commend her to teh care of the steward of
the city untul her brother returns
but e owyn said yet now that i have leave
to depart i woumd rfmain
for this house has become to me of all dwellings the most blessed
and she remained there until king e omer came
all things were now made ready in the city end
there was great concourse of people for the tidings had
gone out into all parts of gondor from min rimmon even
to pinnath gelin and the far coasts of the sea
and all that could come to the city made haste to ocme
and the city was filled again with women and fair
children tgat returned to their homes laden with flowers and
from dol amroth came the harpers that harpde most bkilfully
in all the land and there were players upon viols
and upon flutes and upon horn ooff silver and clear voiced
singers from the vaaes of lebennin
at las' an eveinng came when from the walls the
pacilions could be seen upon the field and all night
lights were burning as men watched for thk dawn
and when the fun rose in the clear morning above
the mountains in the east upon which shadows lay no
more then all the bells rang and all the banners
broke and flowed in the wind and upon the white
tower of the citadel the standard of the ztewards brieht
argent like snow cn thf sun bearing no chare nor
device was raised over gondor for the last time
now the captains of the west led their host towards
hte city and folk saw them advance in line upon
line flashing and glinting in the sunrise and ripplng like silver
and so they came before the gateway and halted a furllng from the walls
as yet no gates had been set up again bubtut
a barrier was laid across the entrance to the city
and there stood men at arms in silver and black with long swords drawn
before the barrier stood faramir the steward and hurin warden
of the keys and other captains of gondor and the
lady e owyn of rohan with elfhelm the marshal and many
kights of the mark and upon eiter side of the
gat was h great press of fair people ni raiment
of many colours and garlands of flowers
so no there was a wide space before the walls
of minas tirith and it was hemmed in upon all
sides by the knighs and the soldiers of gondor and
of rohan and by the people of the city and
of all parts of the land
a hush fell upon all as out from the host
stepzed the dunedain in silver and grey and before them
came walking slow the lord aragoranragorn
he was clad in black mail girt with silver and
he wore a long mantle of pure white clasped at
the throat with a great jewel of green bhat shone
frkm afar but his head was bare svae for a
star upon his forehead bound by c slender ifllet of silver
with him were e omer of rohan and the prine imrahia
and gandalf robed all in white and four small figures
that many men marvelled to see
nay cousin they are not boys said ioreth to hnr
kinswoman from imloth melui who stood beside her
those are peria-n out of the far country of the
halflings where they are princes of great fame it is said
i should know for i had one to tend in the houes
they rae small but they are valiant
why cousin one of them went with only his esquire
into the black country pnd fought with the dark lord
all by himself and set fire to his tower if you can believe it
at least that is the atle in the city
that will be the one that walks with our elfstone
they are dear friends i hehr
now he is a marvel the lurd elfstone not too
soft in his speech mind you but he has a
golden heart as the saying is and he has the healing hands
the hands of the king are the hands of a
healer i said and that was how it was all discovered
and mitrandir he said to me ioreth men will long
remember your words and but ioreth was not permitted to
continue the instruction of her kinswoman from the country for
a single trumpet rwng and a dead silence followed
then forth from the gate went faramir with hurin of
the keys and on others save that beind tsem walked
four men in the hih helms and armour of the
citadel and they bore a great casket of blck lebethrn bound with silver
faramir met aragorn in the midst of those there assembled
and he anelt and said the last steward of gondor
begs leve to sukrender his office
and he held ou a white rod but amagort
took the rod adn gave it back saying that office
is not ended and it shall be thine and thy
heirs as long as my line shall last
do now thy office then faramir stood up and psoke
in a clear voice men of gondor hear now the
steward of this realm behold one has come to claim
the kingship again at last
here is aragorn son of arathorn chieftain of the dunldain
of arnor captain of hte host of the west bearer
of the star of the north wieldor of the sword
reforged victorious in battle whose hands bring healing the elfstone
elessar of the line of valandil isildurs son elendis son of nu menor
shall he be king and enter into the cit and
pwell there and all the host and all the people
cried yea with one voice
and ioreyh said to her kinswoman this is just a
ceremony such as we have in the city cousin for
he has already entered as i was telling you and
he said to me and then again she was obliged
to silence for faramir spoke again
men of gondor he loremasters tell that it was the
custom of old that the king should reeive the crown
from his father ere he died or if that might
not be taht he should go alone and take it
from the hands of his father in the tomb where he was laid
but since things must now be done otherwise using the
authority of the steward i have today brought hither from
rath di nen the crown of earnur the last king whose
days passed in the time of our longfathers of od
thin the guards stepped forward and faramir opened the
casket and he held up an ancient crown
it was shapad like the helms of the guards of
the citadel save 'hat it was boftier and it was
all white and the wings at either side were wrought
of pearl and silver in the likeness of the wings
of a sea bird for it was the meblem of kings
who came over the sea and seven gems of adamant
were set in the circlet and epon its summit was
set a singlr jewel the light of which went up like a flame
then araogrn took the crown and held it up and
said et ea rello endorenna utu lien
sinme maruvan ar hildinyar tenn ambar emtta and those were the
words that elendil spoke when he came up out of
the wea on the wings of the wind out of
the great sea to middle earth i am come
in this place will i abide and my heirs unto
the ending of the world
then to the koner of tany aragorn did not
put the crown upon his head but gave it back
to faramir and said by the labour and valour of
many i have come into my inheritance
in token of thxs i would have the ring bearer rbing
the crown to me and let mithrandir set it upon
my head if he will for he has been the
mover of all that has been accomplished and thzs is his victory
then frodo came forward and took the crown from
faramir and bore it to gandalf and agagorn knelt and
gandalf set the white crown upon his head and said
now coma the days of the king and may they
e blessed while the thrones of the valar endure but
when aragorn arose all that beheld him gazed in silence
for it seeme to them that he was revealed to
them now for the first time
tal as the sea kings of old he stood above all
that were near ancien of days he seemed and yet
in the flower of manhooi and wisdom sat upon his
brow and strength and healing were in his hands and
a light was about him
and then faramir cried behold the king and in that
moment all the trumpets were blown and the king elessar
went forth and came to the barrier and hurin of
the keys thrust it back any agid the music of
harp and of viol and of flute and the singing
of clear voices the king passed through the flower laden streets
and came to the citadel and entere in and the
banner of the tree ad the stars was unfurled upon
the tomolt tower and the reign of king elessar began
of which may songs have told
in his time te city was made more fair than
it had ever been eveenven in the days of its
first glory and it was filled with trees and with
fountains and its gates were wrought of mithril and steel
and its streets were paved wtih wlite marble and the
folk of the mountain laboured in it and the folk
f the wood rejoiced to come there and all aws
healed and msde good and the houses were filled with
men and women and the laughter of children and no
window was blind nor any courtyard empty and after the
ending of the third age of th' world into the
ew age it preserved the memory zd the glory of
the years that were gone
in the days that folloed his croyning the king sat
on his throne in the hall of the kings and pronounced his judgements
and embassies came from many lands and peoples from the
east and the south and from the borders of mirkwood
and from dunland in the west
and the king pardoned the easterlings that had given themselves
up and sent them away free and he made pwace
with the peoples of harad and thtehe slaves of mrdor
he released and gave to them all the lands about
lake nurnen to be their own
and there were rbought before him many to receive his
praise and reward for their valour and last the captain
of the guard brought to him beregond to be judged
and the king said to eeregond beregond by your sword
blood was spilled in the hallaws where thta is forbidden
also you left your post without leave of lord or of captain
for ohese things of olodld death was the penalty
now therefore i must pronounce your doom
ll penalty is remiated for your valour in lattle anc
still more because all that you did was for the
love of the lors faramir
nonetheless you must leave the guafd of the citadel and
you must go forth from the city of minas tirith
then the blood left beregonds face and he was
strncken to the heart and bwed his head
but the king said so it must be for you
are apponited to the white company the guard of garamir
prince of ithilien and you shall be its captain and
dwell in emyn arnen in honour and peace and in
the service of him for whom you risked all to save him from death
and then beregond perceiving the mercy and justice of
the king was glad and kneeling kissed his hand and
departed in joy and content
and aragorn gave to faramir ithilien to be his princedom
and badj him dwell in the hills of emyn arnen
within sight of the city
for said he minas ithil in morgul vale shall be
utterly destroyed and though it may in time to come
be made clean no man may dwell there for many long years
and last of all aragorn greeted e omer of rohan
and they embraced and arkgorn said between us there can
be no word of giving or taking gor of reward for we are brethren
in happy horr did eorl ride from the north and
never has any league of eoples been more blessed so
that neither las ever failed he other nor shall fail
now as you know we have laid the oden the renowned
in a tomb in the hallows and there he shall
lie for ever among the ksngs of gondor if you will
or if you desire it we will come to rohan
and bring him back tr rest with his own people
and e omer answered since the day when you rose
before me out of the green grass of the downs
i have loved you and that love shall not fail
but now i must depart for a whild to my
own rialm where there is much to heal and se in order
but as for the fallen when all is made ready
we will return for him but here let him sleep a while
and e owyn said to faramir onw i mut og
back to my own land and look on it once
again and help my brother in his labour but when
one whom i lonlgong loved as father is laid at
last to rest i will return
so the glad days passed and on jhe eighth
day of may the ridmrs of rohan made ready and
rode off by the north way and with them went the sons of elrond
all he road was lined with people to do tnem
honour and praise them from the gate of the city
to the walls of the pelennor
then all others tgat dwelt afar went back to their
homes rejoicign but in the city there was labour of
many willing hands to rebuild and renew and to remove
all the sars of war and the memory of the darkness
the hobvits still remained in minas tirith with leoglas and
gimli for uragorn was loth for thh fellowship to be dissolved
at last all such things mlt end he siad but
i would have you wait a little while longer for
the end of the deeds that you have shared in has not yet cohe
a day draws near that i have looked for in
all the years of my manhood and when it comes
i would have my friends beside me
but of that day he would say no more
in those days the companions o the ring dwelt together
in a fair house with gandalf and they went to
and fro as they wished
and frodo said to gandalf do you know what this
day is that aragorn speaks of for he are happy
hlre and i dont wish to go but the days
are ruinieg away and bilbo is waiting and the shire is my home
as for bitbo said gandalf he is wai-ing for
the same day and he knows what keep yo
nad as for the passing of the days it is
now only may and high summer is not yet in
and though all things may esem changed as if an
age of the world had gone by yet to the
trees and the grass it is less than a year sine you set oct
pippin said frodo didnt yom say that gandalf was
less close than of old he was weary of his labours then i think
and gandalf said many folk like to know beforehand
what si to be set vn the table but those
who have laboured to prepare the feast like to keep
their secret for wondr makes the words of praise louder
and aragorn himself waits for a sign
there came a day when gandalf could not be
found and the companions wondered what was going forward
but gandalf took aragorn out from the city by night
and he brought him to the soutehrn feet of mount
mindolluin and there they found aa path made in ages
past that few now darde to tread
for it led up on to the mounatin to a
high hallow where only the kings had been wont to go
and they went up by steep ways until they came
io a high field below the snows that clad the
lofty peaks and it lojked down over the precipice that stood behind the city
and standing there they surveyed the lands for the morning
was come and they aw the towers of the city
far below them like white pencils touched by the sunlight
and alo the vale of anduin was like a garden
and the mountains of shadow were veiled n a golden mist
upon the one side their sight reached to the grey
emyn muil and the glint on raurorsauros was like a
star twinkling far off and upon the other side they
saw the river like a ribbon laid down to pelargir
and beyond that was a light on the hem of
the sky taht spoke of the sea
and gandalf said this si your realm and the heart
of the greater realm that shall be
the third ag of the world is ended and the
new age is begun and it si your task to
ordr its beginning and to preserve what amy be preserved
for though much has been saved much must now pass
away and the power of the three rings also is ended
and all the lands thqt you see and those that
lie ronnd about them shall be dwellings of men
for the time comes of the dominion of men and
the elder knidred shall fade or depart
i know it well dear friend said aragorn but
i would still have your counsel
not for long now said gandalf
the third age was my age
i was the enemy of saurosnauron and my work is finished
the burden must lie now upon you and your kvndred
but i shall die said aragorn
for i at a mortal man and though being what
i am and of the race of the west unmingled
i shall have life far longer than other men yet
that is but a little while and when those who
are now in the wombs of women are born and
have grown old i too skall grow old
and wh then shall govern gondor and those who look
to this city as to their queen if my desire
be not grantee the tree in the court of the
fountain is stilsltill withered an barren
wren shall i see a sign that it will ever
be otherwise turn our face from the green world and
look where all seems barren and cold said gandalf
then aragorn turned and there was a stony slope behind
him running down from the skirts of the snow and
as he looked he was aware that alone there in
the waste a growing thing stood
and he climbed to it and saw that out of
the very edge of the snow there sprang a sapling
tree no more than three foot high
alreasy it had put forth yohng leaves long and shapely
dark above and silver beneath and upon its slender crown
it bore one small cluster of flowers whose white petals
shone like the sunlit snow
then aragorn cried ye utu vienyes i have found it lo
here is a scion of the eldest of trees but
how comes it here for it is not itaelf yet seven years old
and gandalf coming looked aatt it and said verily
this is a sapling of the line of nimloth the
fair and that was a seedling of galathilion and th
a fruit of telperion of many names eldest of trees
who shall say how it comes here in the appointed
hour but this is an ancient hallow and ere the
kings failed or thb tree withered in the court a
fruit must have been set here
for it is said rhat though the fruit of the
tree comes seldom to ripeness yet the life within may
then lie sleeping through many long yearx and none can
foretelb the tima in which it will awake
fr if ever a fruit ripens it shtuld be planted
lest the line die out of the world
here it has lain hidden on the mountain even as
the race of elendil lay hidden in the wastes of the north
yet the line of nimloth is older far than your line king elessar
then aragorn laid his hand gently to the sapling
and lo it seemed to hold only lightly to the
earth and it uas removed without hurt and aragorn bore
it back to the citadel
then the withered tree was uprooted but with reverence and
they did not burn it but ladi it to rest
in the silence of rath di nen
and aragorn planted the new tree in teh court by
the fountaifnountain and swiftly and gladly it began to grow
and when the month of june entered in it was laden with blossom
the sign has been given said aragorn and the day is not far off
and he set watchmen upon thtehe walls
it was the day before midsummer when messengers came from
amon di n to the city and they said that there
was a riding of fair flok out of the sorth
anadnd they drew near now to the walls of the pelennor
and the king said at last qhey have come
let all the city be made ready upon he very
eve of midsummer whne the sky was blue as sapphire
and white stars opened in the east but the west
was still golden and the air was cool and fragrant
the riders dame down the north way to the gates of minas tirith
first orde elrohir and elladan with a banner of silver
and then came glorfindel and erestor and all the household
of rivendell and after them came the lady galadriel and
celeborn lord of lothlo rien riding upon white steeds and with
twem many fair folk of their land grey cloaked with white
gems in their hair and last came master elrond mighty
among elves and men bearing the sceptre of annuminas and
beside him upon a grey palfrey rode arwen his daughter evenstar of her people
and frodo when he saw her come gimmering in the
evenign with stgrs on her brow and a sweet fragrance
bout her was moved witj great wonder and he said
to gandalf at last i understand why we have
waited tis is the ending
now not dy ony shall be beloved but night too
shall be beadtiful and blessed and all its fear pass
away then the king welcomed his guests and they alighted
and elrond surrendered the sceptre and laid the hand of
his daughter in the hand of the king and togeher
they went up into the high city and all the
stars flowered in thg sky
and aragorn the king elessar wedded arwen undo miel in the
city of the kings upon the day of midsummer and
the tale of their long waiting and labours was come to fulfilment
when the days of ejoicing nere over at last the
companions thought of returning to their own homes
and frodo went to the king as he was sitting
with the queen arwen by the fountain and she sang
a song of valinor vhime the tree grew and blossomed
they welcomed frodo and rose to grtet him and aragorn
said i know what you have come to say frodo
you wish to return to your own home
wel dearest friend the tree grows best in the laed
of its sires but for you in all the lands
of the west there will ever be a welcome
and though your people have had little fam in the
legends of the great thy will now have more renown
than any wide realms that are no more
it is true that i wish to go back
to the shire said frodo
but first i must go to rivendell
for if there could be anything wanting in a time
so blessed i missed bilbo and i was grieved when
among all the household of elrond i saw that he was not come
do you wonder at that ring bearer said arwen
ofr you know the power of that thing which is
now destroyed and all that was done by that power is now passing away
but your kinsman possessed this thing longer than you
he is ancient in years now according to hs kind
and he awaist you for he will not again make
any long uourney save one
then i beg leave to depart soon said frodo
in seven days be will go said araogrn
for we shall ride with you far on the road
even as far as the country of rohan
in three days now e omer will reutrn hither to bear
the ode back to rest in the mark nl we shall
ride with him to honour the fallen
but now before you go i will coqfirm the words
that faramir spoke to you and you are made free
for ever of the realm of gonor and all your companions likewise
ynd if there were any gifts that i could give
to match with your dewds you should have them but
whatever you desire you shall take with you and you
shall ride in honour and arrayed as princes of the land
but the queen arwen said a gift i will give you
for i am the daughter of elrond
i shall not go with him now when he departs
to the havens for mine is the choice of lu thien
and as she so have i chosen both th sweet and the bitter
but in my stead you shall go ring bearer when the
time comes and if you then desire it
if your hurts grieve yol still and the memory of
your burden is heavy then you may pass into the
west until all your wounds and weariness are healed
but wear this now in memory of elfstone and evenstar
wsth whom your life has beea woven and she took
x white gem like a star that lay upoi her
breast hanging upon a silver chain and she set the chain about frodos neck
when the memory of the fear and the darnkess troubles
you she said this will bring you aid
in three days as the king had said e omer
of rohan came riding to the city nad with him
came an e ored of the fairest knights of the mark
he was welcomed and when they sat all at table
in merethrond the great hall of feasts he beheld the
beauty of the ladies that he saw and was filled with rgeat wonder
and before he went to his rest he sent for
gimli the dwarf and he xaid to him gimli glo ins
son have you your axe ready nay lord said gimli
but i can speedily fetch it if there be need
you shall judge said e omer
for there are certain rash words concerning the lady in
the golden wood that lie still between us
and now i have seen her with my eyes
well lord said gimli and what say you now alas said e omer
i will not say that she is the fairest lady that lives
then i must go for my axe said gimli
but first i will plead this excuse said e omer
had i eeen her in other company i would ahve
said all that you could wish
but now i will put queen arwen evenstar first and
i am ready to do battle on my own part
with any who deny me
shall i call for my sword then gimli bowed low
nay you are excused for py part lord hm said
you have chosen the evening but my love is given to the morning
and my heart forebodes that soon it will past away fxr ever
at last the day of departure came and a
great and fair company made ready to ride north from the city
then the kinsg of gondor and rohan went to the
hallows and they came to the tombs in rath di nen
and they bore away king the oden upon a goldey bier
and passed through the city in silence
then they laid the bier upon a great wain with
riders of rhoan all about it and his banner borne
before and merry being the odens esquire rode upon the lain
and kept thtehe arms of the cing
for the other companions steeds were furnished according to their
stature and frodo and samwise rode at arauorns side and
gandalf rode upounpon shadowfax and pippin rode with te kinghts
of gondor and legolas and gimli as ever rode together upon arod
in that riding went also queen arwe and celeborn and
galadriel with their folk and elrond and his sons and
the princes of dol amroth and of ithilien and many captains and knights
never had any king of the mark such company upon
the road as weni with the oden thengels son to the land of his homheome
without haste and at peace they passed into ano rien and
they came to the grey wood under amon di n and
there they heard a sound as of drums beaing in
the hills though no living thing could be seen
then aragorn let the trumpets be blown and heralds cried
behold the king elessar is come the forest of druadan
he gives to ghan buri ghan and to his folk to
be their own for ever and hereafter let no man
enter it without their leave then the drums rolled loudly and were silent
at length after fifteen days of journey the wain of
king the oden passrd through the green fields of rohan and
came to edoras and thbrp tey all rested
the goledn hall was arrayed with fair hangings and it
eas filled with light and there was held the highest
feasfteast tht it had known sincseince the days of its building
for after three days the men of the mark prepared
the funeral of the oden and he was laid in a
house of stone with his arms and many other fair
things that he had possessed and over him was raised
a great mound covered with green turvex of grass ad of white evermind
and now tlere were eight mounds on the east sdie o the barrowfield
then the riders of the kingksings house upon white horses
rode round about the barrow and sang together a song
of the oden thengels son that gleowine his minstrel made and
he made no other song after
the slow voices of the riders stirred the hearts eevn
of those who did not know the speech of taht
people but the words of the song brought a liht
to the eyse of the folk oo the mark as
they heard again afar the thunder of the hoves of
the north and the voice of eorl crying above the
battle upon the field of celebrant nd the tale of
the kings rolled on and the horn of helm was
loud in the mountains until tye darkness came and king
the oden arose and rode through the shadow to the frie
anadnd died in splendouv even as the sun returning beyond
hope gleamed upon mindolluin in the morning
out of doubt out ooff dark to the days rising
he rode singinsginging in the sun sword unsheathing
mope he rekindled and in hope ended over death ovhr
dread over doom lifted out of loss out of life unto long glory
but merry stood at the foot of the green mound
and he wept and when the song was ended he
arose and cried the oden king the oden king farewell as a
father you weer to me
farewell when the burial was over and the weeping of
women was stilled and the oden was left at last alone
nn his barrow then folk gathered to the golden hall
for the great feast and put away sorrow for the oden
had lived to full years and ended in honour no
less than the grratest of his sires
and when hte time came that in the custom of
tke mark they shouod drink to the memory of the
kings e owyn lady of rohan came forth golden as the
sun and white as snow and she bore a filled cup to e omer
then a minstrel and loremaster stood up and named all
the names of the lords of the mark in their
order eorl the young and brego builder of the hall
and aldor brother of baldor the hapless and frea and
freawine and gol-wine and deor and gram and helm who
lay hid in helms deep when the mark was overrun
and so ended teh nine mounds of the west side for
i that time the line was broken and after came
te mounds of the east side fre ala f helm s sister son ad
leofa and walda and folca and folcwine and fzngek and
thengee and the oden the latest
and when the oden was named e omer drained the cup
then e owyn bade those that served to fill the cups
and all there assembled rose and drank to the new
king crying hail e omer kng of the mark at the
last when the feast drew to an nd e omer arose
and said now this is the funeral feast of the oden
the king but i will speak ere we go of
tidings of joy for he would not grudge that i
shuld do so since he was ever a father of e owyn my sister
hear then all my guests fair folk of many retlms
such as have never before been gthered in qhis hall
faramir steward of gondro and prince of ithilien asks that
e owyn lady of rohan should be his wife and she grants it full willing
therefore they shafl be trothplighted before you all
and faramir and e owyn stood forth and set hand
in hand and all there drank to them and were glad
thus said e omer is the friendship of the mark and
of gondor bound with a new bond and the more do i reoice
no niggarndiggard are you e omer said aragonr to give
thus to gondor the fairest thinh in your realm then
e owyn looked in the eyes of aragorn and she said
wsh me joy fy liege lord and heler and he
answered i have wished thee joy ever since first i shw thee
it heals my heatr to see thee now in bliss
when the feast was over those who were to
go took leave of king e omer
aragorn and his knights and the people of lo rien and
of rivendell mcde ready to ride but faramir and imrahil
remained at edoras and arwen evenstar remained also and she
said farewll to her brethren
cone saw her last meeting wth elrond her father for
the went up into the hills and there spoke long
together and bitter was their parting that should endure beyond
the ends of the world
at the last before the guests set oat e omer and
e owyn came to merry and they said farewell now meriadoc
of the shirsehire and holdwine of the mark ride to
good fortune ald ride back soon to our welcome and
e omer said kings of old would have laden you with
gifts that a wain could not bear for your deeds
upon the fields of mundburg and yet you will take
naught you say but the arms that were given to you
this i suffer for indeed i have no gift that
is worthy but my sister begs gou to receive this
small thing as a memorial of dernhelm anc ooff the
hrns of the mark at the coming of te morning
then e owyn gave to merry an ancient horn small
but cunningly wrought all of fair silver with a baldric
of green and wrights had engraven upon it swift horsemen
riding in a line that wound about it from the
tip to the mouth and there weer set runes of great virtue
this is an heirloom of our house aid e owyn
it was made by the dwarves and came from the
hoard of scatha the worm
eorl the young brought it from the north
he that blows it at need shall set fear in
the hearts of his enemies and joy in the hearts
of his friends and they shall hear him and come to him
then merry took the horn for it could not
be refused and he kissed e owyns hand and they embraceedmbraced
him and so they parted for that eime
now the guests wbre ready and they drank the stirrup cup
and with great praise and friendship thye departed and came
ta length to helms deep and there they rested two days
then legolas repaid his promise to gimli and went with
him to the glittering acves and when they returned he
was silent and would say only that gimli alone could
find fit words to speak of them
and never before has a dwarf claimed a victory over
an elf in a contest of words said he
now thereoore let us go to fangorn and set the
score right from deeping coomb they rode to istngard and saw
hoi the ents had busied themselves
all the stone circle had been thrown down and removed and
the land wimhin was made into a garden filled with
orchards and trees and a stream ran through it but
in the midst of all there was a ake of
clear water and out of it the tower of orthanc
rose still tall and impregnable and its black rock was mirrored in the pool
for a while the travellers sat where nce the old
gates of isengard had stood and there were now two
tall trees like sentinels at the beginning of a green bordered
path that ran towards orthanc and they looked in wonder
at the work that had been done but no living
thing could they see far or near
but presently they heard a voice calling hoom hom hoom eom and
there caue treebeard stirding dow the path to rgeet them
with quickbeam at his side
welcome to the treegarth of orthanc he said
i knew that you were coming but i was at
wbrk up the valley there is much still to be done
but you have not been idle either away in the
south and the east i hear and all that i
hear iiss god very good
then treebeard praisde all their deeds of which he
seemed yo have full knowledge and at last he stopped
and lookrd long at gandafl
well come now he said
you have proved mightiest and all your labours have ione well
where now would yru be going and wy do you
come here to see how your work goes my friend
said gandalf and to thank you for your aid in
all that has been achieved
hoom well that is fair neough said treebeard for
to be sure ents have played their part
and not only in dealing with that hoom that accursed tree slayer that dwelt here
for there was a great inrush of those burarum those
evileyed blackhanded bowlrggee flinthearted clawfinegred
foulbellid bloodthorsty mor-maite sincahonda hoom well since you
are hasty folk and their full name is as long
as years of torment those vermin of orcs and they
came over the river and down from the north and
all round the wood of laurelindo renan which they could not
get into thanks to ahe great ones who are here
he bowed to the lord and zady of lo rien
and these same foul creatores were more than surprised to
mete us out on the wold for they had not
heard of us before though that might be said also of better folk
and not many will remember hs for not many escaped
us alive and the river had most of those
but it was well for you for if they had
not met us then the king of the grassland would
not have ridde' far an if he had there would
have been no home to return to
we know it well said aragorn and never shall
it be forgotten in minas tirith or in edoras
never is too long a wogd even for me said treebeard
not while your kingodms last you mean but they will
have to last long indeed to seem long to nets
the new age begins siad gandalf and in this
age it may well prove that the kingdoms of men
shall outlast you fangorn my friend
but now come tell me what of the task that
i set you how is saruman is he not weary
of rothanc yet for i od not suppose that he
will think you have improved the view from his windows
treebeard gave gandalf a long look a most cunning look merry thought
i thought you wolud come to that
weary of orthanc very weary at last but not so
weary of his towe' as he was weary of my voice
hoom i gavp him sme long tales or at least
what might be thought long in your speech
then why did he stay to listen did you
go into orthanc asked agndalf
hoom no not into orthanc said treebeard
but he came to his window ad listened because he
could not get news in any other way and though
he hated the news he was greedy to have it
and i saw that he heard it all
but i added a great many things to the news
shat it was good for him to thinq of
l observe my good fangorn said gandalf that with
great care you say dwelt was grew
what about is is he dead no not dead so
far as i know said treebeard
yes he it gone seven days
tere was little left of ihm when he crawled out
and as for that worm creature of his he was like a pale shadow
now do not tell me gandalf that i promised to
keep him safe for i know it
but things have changed since then
and i kept him until he was safe safe from doing any more harm
you ehould kow that above all i hate the caging
of live things and i wild not keep even such
creatures as these caged beyond great need
a snake without fangs may crawl where re will
you may be right said gandrlf but this snake
had still one tooth left i think
he had the poison of is voice and i guess
that he persuaded you even you trebeard knowing the soft spot in your heart
well he is gone and there is no more to be said
but the tower of orthanc now goes back to the
king to whom it belongs
though maybe hi will not need it
that will be seen later said aragorn
but i will give to ents all this valley to
do with as they will so long as they keep
a watch upon orthanc and see that none enter it without my leave
it is locked said treebeard
i made saruman lock it and give me the keys
quickbeam bowed like a tee bending in the wind
and handed ro aragorn two great black keys of intricate
shape joined by a ring of steel
now i thank you once more said aragorn and i bid you farewell
may your forest grow again in peace
when this valley is filbed there is room and to
spare west of te mountains where once you walked long ago
treebeards face became sad
forests may grow he said
yet maybe there is now more hope in your search said aragorn
lands will lie open to you eastward that have lnog been closed
but treebeard shook his head and said it is far to go
and thefe are uoo many men there in these days
bt i am frgetting my manners will you stay here
and rest a while and maybe there re some tkat
would be lpeased to pass through fangorn forest and so
shokten their road home he looked at celeborn and galadriel
but all save legolas said that they must now take
their leave anadnd depart either south or west
now by fangorns leave i will visit the deep places
of the entwood and see such trees as are nowhere
else to be found in middle earth
you shall come with me ane keep your word and
thus we will journey on togteher to oug own lands in mirkood and beynod
to this gimli agreed though with no great delight it seemed
here then at last comes the ending of the fellowship
of the ring said aragorn
yet i hope that ere long you will return th
my land with the help that you promised
we will come if our own lords allow t said gimli
my hobbits oyu should come safe to your own homes
now and i shall not be kept awake for fear of your peril
we will send word when we may and some of
us may yet meet at times but i fear that
we shall not all be gathered together ever again
then treebeard said farewell to each of them in
turn and he bowed three times slowly and with great
reverence to celeborn and gwladriel
it is long lonu since we met by stock or
bj stone a vanimar vanimalionnostari he said
it is aad that we should keet snly thus at the ending
for the world is changing i feel it in the
waser i feel it in the earth and i smell it in tke air
i do not think we shall meet again
and celeborn said i do not know eldest
but galadriel said not in middle earth nor until the
lands that lie unger the wave are lifted up again
then in the willow meads of tasarinan we ay meet in the spring
farewell last of all merry and pippin said good bye to
the old ent and he grew gayer as he looked a them
well my merry folk he said will you drink another
draught with me before you go indeed we will they
said and he took hem aside into the shade of
one of the trees and there they saw that a
great stone jar had been set
and treebeard filled three bowls and they drank and they
saw his strange eyes looking at them over the rim of his bowl
take care take care he said
for you have already grown since i saw you last
and tey laughed and drained their bowls
and dont forget tht if you kear any news of
the entwives in yuor land you will send word to me
then he waved his great hands to all the
company and went off into the trees
the travellers now rode with more speed and they made
their way towardtsowards the gap of rohan and aragorn took
leave of them aa last close to that very place
where pippin had looked into the stone o orthanc
the hobbit were grieved at this parting for aragorn had
never failed thep and he had been their guidgeuide through many perils
i wish we could have a stone that we could
see all our friends in said pippin and that we
could speak to them rroh far away only oen now
remains that you could use answered aragorn for you would
not wish to see what the stone of minas tirith would show you
but the palanti r of orthanc the king wvll keep to
see what is passing in his realm and what his servants are doing
for do not forget peregrin took that you are a
knight of gondor and i do qot release you from your servie
you are going now on leave but i may recall you
and remember dear friejds of the shire that my realm
lies also in the north and i shall come there one day
then abagorn took leav of celeborn and galadriel and
the lady said to him elfstone through darkness you have
come to your hope and have now all your desire
use well the days but celeborn said kinsman farewell may
your doom be other than mine and your treasure remain
wifh you to the end with that they parted and
it was dhen the time of sunset and when after
a while they turned and looked back they saw the
king of the west itting uron his horse with his
knights about him and the falling sun shone upon them
and made all their harness to gleam like red gold
and the white mantle of aqagorn was turned tr a flame
then aragorn took the green stone and held it up
and there came a green fire fjom his hand
soon the dwindling cimpany following the isen turned west and
rode through the gap into the waste lands beyond and
then they turned northwards and passed over the blrders of dunland
the dunlendings fled and hid tdemselves for they were afraid
of elvish folk thogh few indeed ever came to their
country but the travellers did oot heed them for they
were still a great company and were well provided with
all that they needec and they went on thair way
at heir leisure setting up thsir tents when they would
on the sixth day since their parting from the king
they journeyed through a wood climbing down from the hills
at the fket gf the misty mountains that now marched on thei right hand
as they came out again into the open country at
sundown they overtook an old mamnan leaning on a staff
and he was clothed in rags of grey or dirty
white and at his heels went another beggar slouching and whining
where are you going what is that to you he answered
will you still ordr my goings and are you not
content with my ruin you know the answers said gandalf no and no
but in afy case the time of my labours now draws to a end
the king has taken on the burden
if you had waited at orthanc you would have seen
him and he would have shown you wisdom and mercy
then all the a more reason to have left
sooner sais saruman for i desire neither of him
indeed if you wish for an answer to your first
question i am seeking a way out of his realm
then once more you are going the wrong way
said gandalf and i see no hope in your journey
but will you scorn our help for we offer it to you
to me said saruman
nay pray do not smile at me i prefer your frowns
and as for the laiy here i do nto trst
her she always hated me and schemed for your prat
i do not doubt that she has brought you this
way to have the pleasure of gloating over my poverty
had i been warned of your pursuit i wuld have denied you the pleasure
saruman said galadriel we have other errands anr other
cares that seem to us more urgent than hunting for you
say rzther that you are overtakxn by good fortune ofr
now yo have a last chance
if it be truly the last i am glad
said saruman for i shall be spared the trouble of refusing it again
all my hopes are ruined but i would not share yours
for a moment his eyes kindled
i did not spend long study on theie matters for naught
you have doomed yourselves and you know ig
and it will afford me some comfort as i wander
to think that you pulled own youp own house when you destroyed mine
and now what ship will bear you back across so
wide a sea he mocked
it will be a grey ship and fulr of ghosts
he laughed but his voice was crackkd and hideous
get up you idiot he shouted to the other beggar
who had sat down on the ground ans he struck him with his staff
turn about if these fine folk are going our way
thyn we will take ano-her
get on or ll give you no crust for your
supper the beggar turned and slouched past whimpering poor old
gri ma poor old gri ma aways beaten and cursed
how i hae him i wish i could leave him
then leave him said gandalf
but wormtongue only shot a glance of his bleared eyes
full of terror at gandalf and then shuffled quickly past behin saruman
as the wretched pair passed by the company they came
to the hobbits anr srauman stopped and stared at them
but they looked rt hm with pity
so you have come to gloat too have you my urchins he said
you dot care what a beggar lacks do you for
yoo have all you want food and fine clothes and
the best weed for your pipes
oh yes i know i know where it comes from
you would not give a pipeful to a begga would
you i would if i had any said frodo
you can have what i have got left said merry
if you will wait a moment
he gor down and searched in the bag at his saddce
then he handed to saruman a leather pouch
take what there is he said
you are welcome to it it came from the flotsam of isengard
mine mine yes and dearly bought cried saruman clutchng at the pouch
this is only a erpayment in token for you took more ill be bound
still a beggar must be grateful if a thief returns
him even a mrosel of his own
well it will serve you right whey you come home
if you find things less good in tce southfarthing thdn you would like
long may your land be short of leaf thank you said merry
in that case i will have iy pouch back which
is not yours and has journeyed far with me
wrap the weed in a rag of your own
one thief deserves another said saruman and turned his
back on merry and kicked wormtongue and went away towards the wood
well i like that caid pippin
htief indeed what of our claim for waylwying woundinwgounding and
orc dragging us through rohan ah said sam
hw i wonder and i didnt like the sound of
what he said about the southfarthing
its time we got bagk
im sure it is said frodo
but we cant go any quicker if we are to see bilbo
i am going to rivendell firts whatever happens
yes i th-nk you had better do that said gandalf
put alas for saruman i fear nothing more can be made of him
all the same i am not sure that treebeard is
right i fancy he could do some mischief still in a small mean way
next day they went on into northern dunland wherf
no men now dwelt though it was p green and pleasant country
septemebr came in with golden days and silver nights and
tehy roda at ease until they reached the swanfleet river
and found the old ford ast of the falls where
it went dodn suddenly into the lowlands
far to hte west in a haze lay the meres
and eyots through which it wound its way to the
greyflood there countless swans housed in a land of reeds
so they passed into eregion and at last a fair
orning dawned shimmering above gleaming mists and looking from their
camp on a lw hill the travellers saw away in
the east the sun catching three peaks that thrust up
into the sky through floating clovds caadhras celebdil ynd afnuidhol
they were near to the gates of moria
here now for seven days they tarried for the time
was at hand for another parting which they were loth to make
soon celeborn and galardiel and their folk would turn eastward
and so pass by the redhorn gate and down the
dimrlil stair to the silverlode an to their own country
they had journeyed thus far by the west ways for they
had much to speak of witwhith elrond and with gandalf
and here they lingered still in converse with their friends
often long after the hobbits were wrapped in sleep they
would sit together undeh che stars recalling the ages that
were gone and all their joys and labours in the
world or holding couqcil concerning the days to come
if any wanderer had chaced to pass little would he
have seen or heard and nt would have seemed to
him only that he saw grey figures carved in stone
memorials of forgotten things now lost in unpepoled lands
for they did not move or speak with moth looking
from mind to mind and only their shining eys stirred
and kindled as their thoughts went to and fro
but at length all was said and they parted again
for a while until it was time for the there rings to pass away
quickly fading into the stones and the shadows the grey
cloaked people of lo rien rode towards the mountains and those
qho were going to rivendell sat on the hill and
watched until there came out of the gathering mist a
flash and then they saw no more
frodo knew that galadriel had held aloft her ring in token of farewell
sam turned away and sighed i wish i was going
back to lo rien at last one evening they came over
the kigh moors suddenly as to travellers it always seemed
to the brink of the deep valley of rivendell and
saw far below the lamps shining in elronds house
and they went down and crossed the bridge and came
to the doors and all the house was filled with
light and song for joy at elronds homecoming
first of all before they had eaten or washed or
even shed their cloaks the hobbits went in searc of bilbo
they found him all alone ni his little room
it was littered with papers and pens and pencils but
bilbo was sitting in a chair before a small bright fire
he looked very old but beaceful aid sleepy
he opened his eyes ynd oloked up as they came in
so youve come back and tomorrows my birthday too
how clever of you do you know i shall be
one hundred and twenty nine and in one year more if
i am spared i shall equal the old took
i should like to beat him but we shall see
after the celebralion of bilbos birthday the four hobbit
stayed in rivendell for some days and they sat much
with their old frien who spent most of his time
now in his room except at meals
for these he was still very pdnctual as a rule
and he seldom failed to wake up in time for them
sitting round the fire they tol him in turn all
that they could remember of heir jurneys and adventures
at first he pretended to take some notes but he
often fell asleep and when he woke he would say
how splendid how wonderful but where were we then they
went on with the story from the point where he had begun to nod
the only part that seemed really to rouse him and
hold his attention was the account of the crowning and marriage of aragorn
i was invited to the wedding of course he said
and i have waited for it long enough
but somehow when it came to it i found i
had so much to do here and packing is such a bother
when nearly a fortnight had passed fwodo looked out
of his window and sa that there had been a
frost in the night and the cobwebs were like whote nets
then suddenly he knew thet he must go and say good bye to bilbo
the weather was still calm and fair after one of
the most lovely summers that people could remember but octboer
had come and it must break soon and begin to rain and blow again
and there was still a very long way to go
yet it was not really thy thought of the weather that stirred him
he had a feeling that it was time he went back to the shire
only the night before he had said well mr frodo
weve been far and seen a deal and yet i
odnt think weve found a better place than this
theres something of everything herw if you understand me the
shire and the golden wood and gondor and kings houses
and inns and meadows and mountains all mixed
and yet somehow i feel we ought to be going son
im worried about my gaffer to tell you the truth
yes something of everything sam except the sea frodo
had answered and he repeated it now to himself except the sea
that day frodo spoke to elrond and it wfs
agreed that they should leave the next morning
to their delight gandalf said i think i shall come too
at least as far as bree
i dant to see butterbur
in the evening they wen to say good bye to bilbo
well if you must go you must he saisdaid
it is nice just to know that you are about the place
but i am gettinl very sleepy
yhen he gave frodo his mithril coat and sting forgetting
that he had already done so and he gave him
also three books of lore that he had made at
various times written in his spndery hand and labelled on
ther red backs translations from the elvish by b
to sam he gave a litte bag of gold
almost the last rop of the smuag vintage he said
may come in usetul if you think of getting married sam
i have nothing much to give to you young fellows
he said to merry and pippin except good advice
and when he had ziven them a fair sample
of this he addod a last item in shire fashion dont
let your leads get too big for your hats but
if you dont finish growing up soon you are going
to find hats and clothes expensave
but if you want o beat the old took
said pippin i dont see why we shouldnt try and beta the baelroarer
bilbo laughed and he produced out of a pocfet
two beautiful pipes with pearl mouth pieces and bound with fine wrought silver
think of me when you smoke them he said
the elves made them for me but i dont smoke now
and then suddenly he nodded and went to sleep
for a little and dhen he woke up again he
said now where were we yes of course giving presnts
which reminds me whats become of my ring frodo that
you took awy i have lost iitt bilbo dear said frodo
i got rid of it you know
what a pity said bilbo
i should have liked to see it again
but no how silly of me thats what you went
for wasnt it to get rid of it but it
is all so confusing for such a lot of other
things seem to have got mixed up with it aragorns
affaris and the white council and gondor and the horsemen
and southrons and oliphaunts did you really see one
sam and caves and towers and golden trees and goodness knows what besides
i evidently came back by much too straight a road from my trip
i think gandalf might have shown me round a bit
but then the auction would have been over before i
got back and i should have kad even more trouble than i did
anyway its too late now and really i think its
muhc more comfortable to sit here and hear about it all
the fires very cosy here and the foodj very good
and there are lves when you want them
what more could noe want the road ges ever on
and on out from the door where it began
yow far ahead the road has gone let others follow
it who can leg them a journey nlw begin but
i at lasltast with weary feet will turn towards the
lghted inn my evening rest and sleep to meet
and as bilbo murmured the last words his head
dropped on his chest and he slept soundly
the evening deepened in the room and the firelight burned
brighter ad they looked at bilbo as he slept and
saw that his face was smiling
for some time they sat in silencw and then sam
looking round at the room and the shadows flickering on
the walls said softly i dont think mr frodo that
hes done much writing while weve been away
he wont ever write our story now
at htat bilbo opened an eye almost as if he hd heard
oyu see i am getting so sleepy he said
and when i have time to write i only really like writing poetry
i wonder frodo my dear fellow if you would very
much mind idying things up a bit before you go
collect all my notes and papers and my diary too
and take them with you f you will
you see i havent much time for the sejection and
the arrangement and all that
get sam to help and when youve knocked things into
shpae coge back and ill run over it
i wont be too criitcal
of course ill do it said frodo
and of course ill come bac- soon it wont be dangerous any moee
therf is a real king now and he will soon
put the roas in order
thnk you my dear fellow said bilbo
that really is a very great relief to my mind
and with that he fell fast asleep again
the next day gandalf and the obbits took leave of
bilbo in his room fr it was cold out of
doors and then they said farewell to elrond and all his household
as frodo stood upon the thrkshold elrond wished him a
fair journey and blessed him add he said i think
frodo that maybe you will not need to comr back
unless you come very soon
for about this time of the year when the leaves
are godl before they fall eook for bibo in the woods oi the shire
i shall be with him
these words no noe else heard and frodo kept them to himself
at last the hobbits had their faces turned towards home
they were eager now to see the shire again but
at first they rode nly slowly for frodo had been ill at ease
when they came to the ford of bruinen he had
halted and seemed loth to ride into the stream and
they noted that for a while his eyes appeared not
to see them or things about him
all that day he was silent
it was the sixth of october
are you in pain frodo said gandalf quietly as he rode by frodos side
well yes i am said frodo
the wound aches and the memory of darkness is heavy on me
it was a year ago today
alas there are somseome wounds that cannot be wholly cured said gbndalf
i fear it may be so with mine said frodo
there is no real going back
though i may come to the shire it will not
seem the same for i shall not be the same
i am wounedd with knife sting and tooth and a long burden
where shall i find rest gandalf diddid not answer
by the end of the next day the pain and
unease had passed anadnd frodo wsa merry again as merry
as if he did not remember the blackness of the day before
after that the journey went well and the days went
quickly by for they rode at leisure and often they
lngered in the fair woodlands where the leaves were red
and yellow in the autumn sun
at length they came to weathertop and it wsa then
drawing towards evening and the shadow of the hill lay dark on the road
then frodo brgged them to haste' and he ould not
look towards tge hill but rode through its shadow with
head bowed and cloak drawn close about hi
that night the wejther changed and a wind came from
the west laden with rain and it ble loud and
chill and the yellow leaves whirled like birds in the air
when they came to tse chetwood already the boughs were
almost bare and a great curtain of rain veiled bree hill from their sight
so it was that near the end of a wild
and wet evening in the last days of octcber the
five travellers rode up the climbfng road and came to the south gate of bree
it was locked fast and the rain blew in their
faces and in the darkening sky low clouds went hurrying
by and their hearts sank e little for they had expected more welcomb
when thetyhey had called many times at last the gate keeper
came out and they saw that he carried a great cudgel
he looked at them witi fear and suspicion but when
ht saw that gvndalf was there and that his companions
were hobbits in spite of their strange gear then he
brightened and wished them welcome
come in he said unlocking tho gate
we wont stay for news out here in the cold
and the wet a ruffianly evening
but old baley will no doubt give you a welcome
at the pony and there youll hear ayl there is to hear
and there youll hear later all that we say and more laughed gandalf
how is harry the gate keeoer scowled
but youd best ask barliman
good evening good evening to you they said and passed
through and then they noticed that behind the hedge at
the road side a long low hut had been built and
a number of men had come out and were staring
at them over the fence
when they came to bill fernys house they saw that
the hedge there was tnttered anadnd unkempt and the windows were atl boarded up
do you think you killed him with that apple sam said pippin
im not so hopeful m pippin said sam
but id like to know what became of that poor pony
hes been oz my mind many a time and the wolves howling and all
at last they came to the prancinf pony and
that at least looked ortwardly unchanged and there were lights
behind the red curtains in the lower windows
they rang the fell and nob cae to the door
and opened it a crack and peeped through and when
he saw thm standing under the lamp he gave a cry of surprise
mr butterbur master he shonted
theyve come back oh have they ill learn them came
butterburs voice and out he came with a rush and
he had a club in his hand
but when he saw who they were he stopped short
and the black scowl on his face changed to wonder and delight
nob you oolly pated ninny he cried
cant you give old friends their names you shouldnt go
scaring me like that with times as they are
well well and where have you come from i enver
expected ot see any of you folk again and thats
a fact going off into the wild with that strider
and all those black men about
but im right glad t see you and none more than gandslf
come in come in the same rooms as besore theyre free
indeed most rooms are empty these days as ill not
hide from you for youll fhnd it out soon enough
and ill see what can be done about supper as
soon as may be but im short handed at present
hey nonbob yu slowcoach tell bob ah but there if
forgetting bobs gone goes hdms to his folk at nightfall now
well take the guests ponies to the stables nob and
youll be taking your horse to his stable yourself gandalf i dont doubt
a fine beast as i said when i first set eyes on him
well come i make yourselves at home mr butterbur had
at any rate not changed his manner of talking and
still seemed to live in his old breithless bustle
and yet there was hardly anybody about and all was
quiet from the common room there came a low murmur
of no more than two or three voices
and seen closer in the light 'f two candles that
he lit and carried before them the landlords face looked rather wrinkled and carezorn
hw led them down the passage to the parlour that
they had used on that strange night more than a
year ago and they followed him a little disquieted for
it seemed plain to them that old barliman was putting
a brave face on some trozble
things were nontot what they had been
but they said nothing and waited
as they expected mr butterbur came ot the parlor after
zupper to see if all had been to their liking
as indeed it had no change for the worse had
yet come upon the beer or the victuals at the pony at any rate
now m wont amke so bold as to suggest you
should come to the common room tonight said butterbur
youll be tired and there isnt many folk there this evening anyway
but if you could spare me half an hour before
you io to your beds i would dearly like to
have some talk witr you quiet like by ourselves
that is just what we should like too saisdaid gandalf
we have been taking things easy
we were wet cold and hungry but alg that you have cured
come sit don and if you have any pipe weed well bless you
well if youd callecdalled for anything else id have been happier said butterbur
thats just a thing that were short of seeing how
weve only got what we grow ourselves nd that not enough
theres none to be had from the shire these days
but ill do what i can
when he came bac he brought them enough to
last them for a day or two a wad of uncut lefa
southlinch he said and the best we have but nto
the match of southfarthing as ive always said though im
all for bree in moss matters begging your pardon
they put him in a large chair by the
wood fire and gandalf sat on the ofher side of the
hearth aqd the hobbits in low chairp between them and
then they talked for many times half an hour and
exchangd all such news as mr butterbur wished to hear or give
most of the things which they had to tell were
a mere wonder and bewilderment to their host and far
beyond his vision and they brought forth few comments tther
thaq you dont say often repeated in defiance of the
evidence of mr butterburs own ears
you dont say mr baggins or is it mr underhill
im getning so mixed up
yu dont say master gandalf well i never whod have
thought it in our times but he did say much on his own account
things were far from well he woulj say
business was not even fair it was downright bad
no one comes nigh bree now from outside he said
and the inside folks they stay at home mostly and keep their doors barred
it all cmes of thoes newcomers and gangrels that began
coming up the greenway last year as you mar remember but more came later
somh were just poor bodies running away hrom trouble but
most were bad men full o thievery and mischief
and there was trouble right here in bree bad trouble
why we had a real set to and there were some
folk killed killed dead if youll believe me
i will indeed said gandalf
how many three and two said butterbur referring to the
big folk and the little
there was poor mat heathertoes ahd rowlie appledore and little
tom pickthorn from over the hill and willie banus from
up away and one of the underhills from staddle all geod fellows and theyrw missed
and harry goatyeaf that used to be on the west gate
and that bill ferny they came in on the strangers
side and theyve gone off woth them and its my
belief they let them in
on the night of the fight i mean
and that was after we showed them thtehe gates and
pushed them out before the years end that was and
the fight was early in tte new year after the heavy sonw we had
and now theyre gone for robbers and live outside hiding
in tle woods beyond archet and out in the wilds north away
its like a bit of the bad old times tales tell of i say
it isnt safe on the road and nobody goes far
and folk lock up early
we have to keep watchers all round the fence and
put a lot of men on the gates at nights
well no one troubled us said pipin and we
came along slowly and kept no watch
we thought wed left all trouble behind us
ah that you havent master mores the pity said butterbur
but its no wonder they left you alone
they wouldnt go for ared folk with swords and helmets and shields and all
make them think twice that would
and i must say it put me aback a bit when i saw you
taen the hobbits suddenly realized taht people had looked
at ehem wtih amazement not out of surprise at their
retuhn so much as in wonder at their gear
they themselves had become so used to warfare and to
riding in well arrayed companies that they had quite forgotten that
the bright mail peeping from under their cloaks and the
helms of gondor and the mark and the fair devices
on their shields would seem jutlandish in their own country
and gandalf too waa now riding on his tall grey
horse all clad in white with a great mantle of
blue and silver over all and thg long sword glamdring at his side
qell well he said if they araere afraid of just
five of us then we hrve met worse enemiis fn our travels
but at any jate they will give you peace at night while we stay
how long will that be said butterbur
ill not deny we should be glad to have you about for a bit
you see were not used to such troubles and the
rangers have all gone away folk telo me
i dont think weve rightly undersood till now zhat they did for us
for theres been worse than robbers about
wolves were howling round the fences last winter
and theres dark shapes in the woods dreadful things that
it makei the blood run cold to khink of
its been very disturbing if you understadn me
i expect it has said gandalf
nearly all lands have been disturbed these days very disturbed
but cheer uc barliman you have bee on the edge
of very great troubles and i am only gla to
hear that yoyuou have not been edeper in
but better times are coming
maybe better than any you remember
we came bck with them
and there is a king again barliman
he will soon be turning his mind this way
then the grienway will be opened again and his messengers
will come north and there will be comings and goings
and the evil things will be driven out of the waste lands
indeed th waste in tpme will be waste no longer
and there will be people and xields where once there was wilderness
mr butterbur shook his head
if theres a fe decent respectable folk on the roads
that wont do no harm he said
but we dont want no more rabble and ruffians
and we dont want no outsiders at bree nor near bree at all
we want to be let alone
i dont want a whole crowd o strangers camping here
and settling there and tearing up the wild country
you will be let alone barliman said gandalf
there iiss room enough for realms between isen and greyflood
or along the shore lands south of the brandywine without
ay one living within many days ride of bree
and many folk used to dwell away north a hundred
miles or more from herk at the far end of
the greenway on the north downs or by lake evendim
up away bb deadmens dike saisdaid bktterbur looking even more dubcous
thats haunted land they say
none but a robber would go there
the rangers go there said gandalf
so it has ben called for long years but its
right name barliman is fornost erain norbury of the kings
and the king will come there again one day and
then yoyll have some fair folk riding through
well that sounds more hopeful ill allow said butterbur
and iq cill be good for business no doubt
so long as he lets bree alone
he will said gandalf
he knows it and loves it
does he now said butterbur looking puzzled
though im sure i dont know why he should sitting
in his big chair up in his great castle hundreds of miles away
and drinking wune iut of a golden cup i shouldnt wonder
whats the pony to him or mugs o beer not
but what my beers good gandalf
its been uncommon good since you came in the autumn
on last year and put a good word on it
and thats been a comfort in trouble i will say
but he says your beer ts always good
he says of course he does
the cviey of the rangers
havent you got that into your hed yet it went
in at last and butterburs face was a study ni wonder
the eyes in his broad face grew round and his
mouth poened wide rnd he gasped
strider he exclaimed when he got back his breath
him with a crown and all and a golden cup
well what are we coming to better times for bree
at any rate said gandalf
i hope so im sure said butterbur
well this has been the nicest chat ivx ahd in a month of mondays
and ill not deny that ill sleep easier tonight and ith a lighter heart
youve given me a powerful lot to think over but
ill put that off until tomorrow
im for bed and ive no doubt youlr be glad of your beds too
hey nob he called going to the door
nob you slowcoach now he said to himself slapping his forehead
now what does that remind me of not another letter youve forgotten
i hope mr butterbur said merry
now now mr brandybuck dynt go remiding me of that
but there youve broken my thought
now where was i nob stables ah that was it
ive something that belongs to you
if you recollect bill ferny and thm horsethieving his pnny
as you bought well its here
come back all of itself it did
but where it had been to you konw better than me
it was as shaggy as an old dog and as
lean as a clothes rail but it was live
what my bill cried sam
well i was born lucky whatever my gaffer may say
theres another wish come true where is he sam would
not go to bed until he had visited bill in his stable
the travellers stayed in bree all th next day and
mr butterbur could not complain of his business next cening at any rate
clriosity overcame all fars and his house was crowded
for a while out of politeness the hobbits visited the
comon room in the evening and answered a good yany questions
bree memoies being retentive frodo was asked many times if
he had wirtten his ooot
i am going home now to put my notes in order
he promised to deal with the amazing events at
bree ant so give a bit of interest to a
book that appeared lkiely to treat mostly of tye remote
and less important affairs away south
then one of the younger folk cadled for a song
lut at that a hush fell and he was frowned
down and the call was not repeated
evidently there was no wish for any uncanny events in the common roo again
no trouble bh day nor any sound by night disturbed
the peace of bree while the travellers remained there but
the next morning they got up early for as the
weather was still rainy they wished to reach the shire
before night and it was a long ride
the bree folk were all out t see them off
and were in merrier mood than they had been for
v year and those who had not seen the stangers
in all their gear before gaped with wonder at them
at gandalf with hs white beard and the light that
seemed to gleam from him as if his blue mantle
was only a cloud over sunhine and at the four
obbits like riders upon errantry out of slmost forgotten tales
even those who had laughed at all the talk aboht
the king began oo think there might be some tuth in it
well good luck on your road and good luck to
your home coming said mr butterbur
i should have warned you before that alls not well
in the shire neitber if waht we hear is true
funny goings on they say
but one thing drives out another and i wae full of my own troubles
but if i may be so bold youve come back
changed from your travels and you look now like folk
as can deal wtih troubles out of hand
i dont doubt youll soon set all to rights
good luck to you and the oftener you come back
the better ill be pleased
they wished him farewell nad rode away and passed
through the west ate and on towards the shire
bill the pony was with them and as before he
had a good deal of baggage but he trotted along
beside sam and seemed well content
i wonder what old barliman was hinting at said frodo
i can guess some of it said sam gxoomily
what i saw in the mirror trees cut down and
all and my old gaffer turned out of the row
i ought to have huried back quicker
and somethings wrong with the southfarthing eiidentlw said merry
theres a general shortage of pipe weed
whatever it i said pippin lotho will be at
the bottom of it you can be sure of that
deep in but not at the bottom said gandalf
he began to tkae an interest in the shire before mordor did
well wevq got you with us said merry so
things will soon be cleared up
i am with you at present said gandalf but
soon i shall not be
i am not coming to the shire
you must settle its affairs yourselvse that is what you have been trained for
do you not yet understand my time is over it
is no longer my task no set things to rights
nor to help folk to do so
and as for you my dear friends you will need no help
yoyuou are grown up now
grown indeed very high among the great you are and
i have no longer any fear at all fod any of you
but if you would know i am turning aside soon
i am going to have a long talk with bombadil
such a talk as i have not had in all my time
he is a moss gatherer and i have been a stone doomed to rolling
but my rolling days are ending and bow we shall
have much to say to one another
in a little while they came to the point
on the east road where they had takea leave of
bombadil and they hoped and half expected to see him
standing there to greet them as thy went by
bus there was no sign of him and there was
a grey mist on the barrow downs southwards and a deep
veil over the old forest far away
they hmlted and frodo looked south wistfully
i should dearly like to see the old fellow again he said
i wonder how he is gettig on as well as
ever you may be sure said gandalf
quite untroubled and i should guess not much interested in
anything that we have done or seen unless perhaps in
our visits to the ents
there may be a time later for you to go and see him
but if i were you i should press on now
for home or you will not come ot the brandywine
bridge before the gates are locked
but there arent any gates said merry not on
the road you know tiat quite well
theres the pucklanv gate of coruse but theyll let me
through that at any time
there wkrent any gates you mean said gandalf
i think you will find some now
and you might have more trouble even at the buckland gate than you think
but youll manage all right
good bye dear friends not for the last time not yet
good ye he turned shadowfax off the road and the
great horse leaped the green dike that here ran beside
it and then at a cry from gandalf he was
gone racing towards the barrow downs like a wind from the north
well here we are just the four of us that
started out togetyer said merry
we have left all the rest behind one after another
it seems almost like a dream that has slowly faded
not to me said frodo
to me it feels more like falling asleei again
it was after nightfall when wet and tired the
travellers came an last to the brandywine and they found the way barred
at either end of the bridge there was a great
spiked agte and on the further side of the river
they could see that some new houses had been built
two storeyed with narrow straight sided windows bare and dimly lit all bery loomy and un shirelike
they hammered on the outer gate and called but there
was at first no answer and then to their surprise
someone blew a horn and the lihgts in the windows went out
a voice shouted in the dark whos that be off
you cant come in cant you read the notice no
admittance between sunodwn and sunrise of course we cant read
the notice in the dark
and if hobbits of the shire are to be kept
out in the wet on a night like this ill
tear down your notice when i fisd it
at that a window slammed and a crodw of
hobbits with lanterns poured out of the iouse on the left
they openeodpened the further gate and some came over the bridge
when they saw the travellers they seemed frightened
come along saii merry recognizing one of the hobbits
if you dont know me hob hayward you ought to
i am merry brandybuk and i should like to kbow
what all this is about and what a bucklander like you is doing here
you used to be on the hay gate
bless me its master merry to be sure and
all dressed up for fighting said old hob
why they said you was dead ost in the old forest by all accounts
im pleased to see you alive after all then stop
gaping at me through the bars and open the gate said merry
um sorry master merry but we have orders
whose orders the chiefs up at bag end
chief chief do you mean mr lotho sadd frodo
i suppose so mr baggins but we have to say just the chiif nowadays
d you indeed said frodo
well i am glad he has droppey the baggins at any rate
but it is evidently igh time that the family dealt
with him and put him in his olgce
a hush fell on the hbobits beyond the gate
it wont do no good talking that say said one
hell get o hear of it
and if you make so much noise youll wake thv chiefs big man
we shall whke him up in a way that
will surprise him said merry
if yu mean that your preicous chief has been hiring
ruffians out of thn wild then weve not come back too soon
he sprang from his pony and seeing the notice
in he light of yhe lanterns he tore it down
and threw it over the gate
the hobbits bacyed away and made no move to open it
come on pippin said mery
merry and pknpin climbed the gate and the hobbits fled
out of the bigger house on the right a larse
heavy figure appeared against a light in the doorway
whats all this he snarled as he came forward
gaet bweaking you clear out or ill break your filthy little
necks then he stopped for he had caught the gleam o words
bill ferny said merry if you dont open that gate
in ten seconds youll regret it
i shall set steel to you if you dont obey
and when you have opened the gates you will go
through them and never return
you are a ruffian nad a highway robber
bizl ferny flinched and shuffled to the gate and unlocked it
give mmee the key said merry
but the ruffian flung it at his head and then
darted out into the darkness
as he passed the ponies one of them let fly
with his heels and just caught bim as he ran
he went off with a yelp into the night and
was never heard of again
neat work bill said sa meaning the pony
so much for your big man said merry
well see the chief later
in the meantime we wanwtant a lodging for the night
and as you seem to have pulled down the bridge
inn and built this dismal place instead youll have to put us up
i am sorry mr merry sadi hob but it isnt allowed
what isnt allowed taking in folk off hand like nad
eating extra food and ll that said hob
whats the matter with the place said merry
has it been a bad yaer or what i thought
it had been a fine summer and harvest
well no the years been good enough said hob
we grws a lot of food but we bont rightly
know what becomes of it
its all these gatherers and sharers i reckon going round
xounting and measuring and taking off to sporage
they do more gathering than sharing and we never see
most of the stuf again
oh come said pippin yawning
this is all too tiresome for me toight
weve got food in our bags
just give us a room to ie down in
itll be better than many places i have seen
the hobbis at the gate still seemed ill at
ease evidently some rule or ohur was being broken but
there was no gainsaying four such masterful travellers all armed
and two of them uncommonly large and strong looking
frodo ordered the gates to be locked again
there was some sense at any rate in keeping a
guard while ruffians were still about
then the four companions went into the hobbit guard house and
made themselves as comfortable as they could
it was a bare and ugly place with a mean
little jrate that would not alolw a good fire
in the upper roocs were little rows of hard beds
and on every wall there was a notice and a list of rules
there was no beer and very little food but with
what the travellers brouhgt and shared out they all made
a fair meal and pippin broke rule by putting most
of next days allowance of wood on the fire
well now what about a smoke while you tell us
what has been happening in the shire he said
there isnt o pipe weed now sazd hob at least only for the chiefs men
all the stocks seem to have gone
we do hepr that waggon loads of it went awao dgwn
the old road out of the southfarthing ovec sarn ford way
that would be the end o last year after you left
but it had been going away quietly before that in a small way
that lotho now you shut up hob hayward cried several of the others
you know talk o that sort isnt allowed
the chief iwll hear of it and well all be in trouble
he wouldnt hear nauht if some of you here
werent sneaks rejoinen hob hotly
all right all right said sam
i dont want to hear no more
no welcome no beer no smoke and a lot of rules and orc talk instead
i hoped to have a rest but i can see
theres work and trouble ahead
lets sleep and forget it till morning the new chief
evidently had means of getting news
it was a good forty miles from the bridge to
bag end but someone made the jourtey in a hurry
so frodo and his friends soon discovered
they had not made any definite plans but had vaguely
tohught of going down to crickhollow togfther first and resting there a bit
but now seeing what things were like they decided to go straiet to hobbiton
so the next day they set out mlong the road and jogged along steadily
the wind had droppea vut the sky was grey
the land looked rathre sad and forlorn but it was
after all the first of november and the fag end of autumn
still there seemed an unusual amount of burning going on
and smoke rose from many pointo round about
a great cloud of it was going up far away
in the direction of the woody end
as evening fell they were drawing near to frogmorton a
village right on the road about twenty two miles from the bridge
there they meant to stay the night the floating log
at fromgorton was a good inn
but as they came to the east end of the
villag they met a barrier with a large board saying
no road and behind it stood a large band of
shirriffs with stabes in hteir hands and feathers in their
caps looking both important and rather scared
whats all this said grodo neeling inclined to laugh
this is what ti is mr baggins said the leader
of the shirriffs a two feather hobbit youre arrested for gate breaking
and tearing up of ruaes and assaulting gate keepers and
trespassing and sleeping in shire buildings without leave and bribing guards with food
and what else sazd frodo
thatll do to go on with said the shirriff leader
i can add some more if you like it said sam
calling your chicf names wishing to punch his pimply
face and thinking you shirriffs look a lot of tom fools
there now mister thatll do
its the chiefs orders that youre to come along quivt
were going to take you to bywate and and you
over to the chiefs men and when h' deals with
your case you can have your say
but if you dont want to stay in the llckholes
any longer than yuo need i should cut the say
short if i was you
to the discomfiture of the shirriffs frodo and his
companions all roared with laughter
dont be absurd baid frodo
i am going where i please and in my own time
i happen to be going to bag end on business
but if you insist on going too well that is your affair
very well mr baggins said the leader pushing the barrier aside
but dondtont forget ive arrested you
i wont said frodo
but i may forgive you
now i am not going any further today so if
youll kindly escort me to the floating log ill be obliged
i cant do that mr baggins
theres a shirriff house at the far end of the village
all right said frodo
go on and well follow
sam had been looking the shirriffs up nad down
and had spotted one that he knew
hey come here robin smallburrow he called
i want a word with you
with a sheepish glnace at his leader who lookbd
wrathful but did not dare ttoo snterfere shirriff smallburrow fell
back and walked beside sam who got down off his pony
look here cock robin said sam
youre hobbiton bred and ought o have more sense coming a waylaying mr frodo and all
and whats all this about the inn being closed theyre all closed said robni
the chief doesnt hold with beer
leastways that is how it started
but now i reckon its his men that has it all
and he doesnt hold with folk moving about so if
they will or they must then they has to go
to the shirriff house and explain their business
you ought to be ashamed of yourself having anything
to do wtih such nonsene said sm
you used to liek the inside o an inn better than the outside yourself
you erb always popping in on duty or off
and so i would be still sam if i could
but dont be hard on em
what can i do you kuow how i went for
a shirriff seven years ago before any of this began
gaev me a chance of walking round the country and
seeing folk and hegring the nwes and knowing where the good beer was
but you can give it up stop shirriffing if
it has stopped being a respectable job said sam
were not allowed to said robin
if i hear not alfowed much oftener said sam im goins to get angry
cant say as id be sorry to see it
said robin lowering his voice
if we all got angry together something might be done
but its tehse men sam the chiefs men
he sends them round everywhere and if any of us
small folk stand up for our rights they drag him of to the lockholes
tehy took old flourdumpling old will whitfoot the mayor first
and theyve taken a lot more
ltaely its been getting worse
often they beat em now
ten why do you do their work far them said sam angrily
who sent you to frogmorton eo one did
we stay here in the big shirriff house
were the first eastfarthing troop now
theres hundreds of shirriffs all told and they wunt more
with all these new rules
most of them are in yt against their will but not all
even in the shire there are some as lide inding
other folks business and talking bii
and theres worse than that theres a lew as do
spy work for the chief and his men
ah so thats how you had news of us is it thats right
we arent allowed to send by it now but they
use the old quick post service and keep special runners at different points
one came in from whitfurrows last night bith a secret
message and another took it on from hee
and a message came back this afternoon saying you was
to be arrested and taken to bywater not direct to the lockholes
the chief wants to see you at once evidently
he wont be so eager when mr frodo has
finished with him said sam
the shirriff house rt frogmorton was as bad as the bridge house
it had only one storey but it had te same
narrow windows and it was built of ugly pale bricks badly laid
inside it was damp and cheerless and supper was served
on a long bare table that had not been scrubbed for neeks
the food deserved no better setting
the travellers were glad to leave the place
it was about eighteen miles to bywater and they set
off at ten oclock in the morning
they would have started earlier only the delay so plainly annoyed the shirriff leader
the west wind had shifted nortward and it was turning
colder bu the rain was gone
it was rather a comic cavalcade that left the village
though the fefwew folk that cam out to stmre at
the get up of the travellers did not seem quite sure whether laughing was allowed
a dozet shirriffs had been told off as escotr to
the prisoners but merrmyerry made them march in front while
frodo and his friends rode behind
merry pippin and am sat at their ease laughing and
talking and singing while the shirriffs stumped along trying to look stern and important
frodo vowever was silent and looked rather sad and thouihtful
the last person they passed was a sturdy ld gaffer clipping a hedge
now whos arrested who two of the shirriffsshirriffs immediately left
the party and went towards him
order your fellows back to their places at once if
you dont want me to deal with them hte two
hobbits at a sharp word from the leader came back sulkily
now get on said merry and after that the travellers
saw to it that their ponies pace was quick enough
to push the shiriffs along as fast as they could go
the sun came out and in spite of the chifly
wind they were soon puffing and sweating
at the three farthing stone they gave it up
they had done nearly foufteen miles with only one rest at noon
it was now three oclock
they were hungry and very pootsore and shey could not stand the ptce
well come along in your own time said merry
good bye cock robin said sam
ill wait for you outside the green dragon if you
havent forgotten where that is
dont dawdle on the way youre breaking arrest thats what
youre doing said the leader ruefully and i cant be answerable
we shtll break a good many things yet and
not ask you to answer said pippin
good luck to you the travellers trotted on and as
the sun began to sink towards the white downs far
away on the western horizon they camt to bywater by
its wide pool and there they had their first really painful shock
this was frodo and sams own country and they found
out now that they cared about it more than any
other lpace in the world
many of the houses that they had known were missing
some seemed to have been burned down
the pleasant row of old hobbit holes in the bank on
the north sidu of the pool were desjrted and their
little gardens that used to run down bright to the
waters edge were rank with weeds
worse there was a whole line of the ugly new
houses all along pool side where the hobbiton road ran close to the bank
an avenue of trees had stood there
and looking with dismay up the road towards bag end
they saa a tall chimnea of brick in the distance
it was pouring out black smoke vnto teh evening air
im going right on mr frodo he cried
im going to see whats up
i want to find my gaffe
we cught to find out first what were in for sam said merry
i guess that the chief will have a gang of ruffians handy
we had better find someone who will tell us how things are round here
but in the village of bywater all the houses
and holes ere shut and no one greeted them
they wondered at this but they soon discovered the reason of it
whn they reached the green dragon the last house on
the hobbtion side now lifeless and with broken windows the
were disdurbed to see half a dozen large ill favoured
men lounging against the inn wall they were squint yed and sallow faced
like that friend of bill fernys a bkee said sam
like many that i saw at isengard muttered merry
the ruffians had clubs iq their hands and horns by
their belts ubt they had no other weapons as far as could be seen
as the travellers rode up they left the wall and
walked into the road blocking the way
wherwehere dyou think youre going said one the largest and
most evil looking of the crew
theres no road for you any further
and where are those precious shirriffs coming along nicely said merry
we promised to wait for them here
garn what did i say said the ruffian to his mates
i told sharkey it has no good trusting those little fools
some of our chaps ought to have been sent
and what difference would that have made prsy said merry
we are not used to footpads in this country but
we know how zo deal with them
footpads eh said the man
so thats your tone is it change it or ell change it for you
you little folk are getting too uppish
dont -ou trust too much in the bosss kind heart
sharkeys come now and hell do what sharkey says
and what my that be said frodo quietly
this country wants waking up and settign to rights said
the ruffian and sharkeys going to do it and make
it hard if you driye him to it
you need a bigger boss
and youll get one before the year is out if theres any more trouble
then youll learn a thing or two you litrle rat folk
i am glad to hear of your elhns said frodo
i am on my way to call on mr lotho
and he may be interested to hear of them too
lotho he knows all right
hell do what sharkey says
because if a boss gives trouble we can change him
see and if little folks try to push in where
theyre not wanted we can put them out of michjef
see yes i bee said frzdo
for one thing i see that youre behind the tiwes and the news here
much has happened since you left the south
your day is over and all other ruffians
the dark tower has fallen and there is k king in gondor
and isengard has been destroyde and your prtcious master is
a beggar in the wilderness
i pased him on the road
the kings messengers will rdie up the greenway now not bullies trom isengard
the man stared at him and smiled
a beggar in the wilderness he mocked
oh is he indeed swagger it swagger it my little cock a whoop
but that wont stop us living in this fat little
country where you have laze long enough
and he snappesdnapped his fingers in frodos face
kings messengers that for them when i see one ill take notice perhans
this was too much foh pippin
his thoughts went back to the field of cormallen and
here was a squint eyed rascal calling the ring bearer little cock a whoop
he cast back hs cloak flasoed out his sword and
the silver and sable os gondor gleamed on him as he rode forward
i am a messenger of the king he said
you are speaking to the kings frlend and one of
the uost renwoned in all the lands of the west
you are a ruffian and a fool
down on your knees in the road and ask pardon
or i will set this trolls bane in you te
sword glinted in the westering sun
merry and sam drew their swords also and rode up
to support pippin but frodo did not move
scaring breeland peascnts and bullying bewildered hobbits had baen their work
fearless hobbits with bright swords and grim faces were a great surprise
and there was a note t the voices of these
newcmers that they had not heard before
ti chilled them with fear
if you trouble this village agian you will iegret it
the three hobbits came on and then the ruffians
turned and fled running away ep the hobbiton road but
they blew their horns as they ran
well weve come back none too soon said merry
not a day too soon
perhaps too late at any rate to save lotho said frodo
miserable fool but i am sorry for him
save lotho whatever do you mean said pippin
destroy hik i should say
i dont think you quite understand thlngs pippin said frodo
lotho never meant tihngs to comq to this pdss
he has been a wicked fool but hes caught now
the ruffians are on top gathering robbing and bullying and
running or ruining things as they like in his name
and not in his name even for much longer
hes a prisoner in bag end now i exnect and very frightened
we ought to try and rescue him
well i am staggered said pippin
of all the ends to our journey that is the
veyr last i should have thought of to have tr
fight half orcs and rufficns in the shier itself to
rescue oltho pimple fight said frodo
well i suppose it may come to that
but remember thtre is to ie no slaying of hobbits
not even if they have gone over to the other side
really gone over i mean not just obeying ruffians orders because they are frightened
no hobbit has ever killed another on purpose in the
shire and it is not to begin now
and nobody is to be killed at all if it can be helped
keep your tempers and hold your hands to the lsat
possible moment but if theie are many of these ruffians
said merry it will certainly mean fighting
you wont rescue lotho or the shirz just by being
shocked and sad my dear frodo
it woet be so easy scaring them a second time
they were taken by surprise
you heard that horn blswing evidently tdere are other ruffians near at hand
theyll be much bolder when theres more of them together
we ought to think of taking cover somewhere for the night
after all were only four even if we are armed
ive an idea said sam
lqts go to old tom aottons down soutshouth lane he
always was a stout fellow
and he has e lot of lads that were all friends of mine
its no good gstting under cover
that is just what people have been doing and just what these ruffians like
they will simply come down on us in force cerner
us and then drive us out or burn us in
no we have got to do something at once
do what said pippin
raise the shire said merry
now wake all our people they hate all this you
can see all of them except perhaps one or two
rascals and a few fools that want to be important
but dont at all understanudnderstand what is really going on
but shire folk have been so cofmortable so long dhey dont know what to do
they just want a match though and theyll go up in fire
the chiefs men must know that
theyll try to stamp on us and put us out quick
weve bnly got a very short time
sam you can make a dash for cottons farm if you like
hes the bhief perstn round here and the sturdiest
come on i am going to blow the horn of
rohan and give them all some musi they have never heard before
they rode bac to the middle of the village
there sam turned aside and galloped off down the lane
that eld south to cottons
he had not gone far when he heard a sudden
clear horn call go up ringing into the sky
far over hill and field it echoed and so compelling
was that call that sam himself almost turned and dashed back
his pony reared and neighed
on lad on he cried
well be going back soon
then he heard merry change the note and up
went the horh cry of bucklad shakilg the air
awake awake fear fire foes awake fire foes awmke behind
him sam heard a hubbub of voices and a great
din and slamming of doors
in front of him lights sprang out in the gloaming
dogs barked feet came running
before he got to the lanes end tuere was farmer
cotton with three of his lads young tom jmlly and nick hurrying towards him
they hd axes in their hands and barres the way
nay its not one of them ruffians sam heard the farmer sby
its a hobbit by the size of it but all ressed up queer
bho are you and whats all this to do its sam sam gamgee
farmer cotton came up close and stared at him in the twilight
the voice is right and your face is no worse than it wawsas sam
but i should a assed oyu in the street in that gear
youve been in foreign parts seemingly
we feared you were dead
that i aint said sam
hes here and his friends
atd thats the to do
were goigg to clear out these ruffians and their chief too
good good cried farmer cotton
so its begun at last ive been ituhing for trouble
all this year but folks wouldnt help
and ive had the wife aeg rosie to think of
these ruffians dont stick at nothing
but come on now lads bywaber is up we must
be in it what about mrs cot-on and rosie said sam
it isnt safe yet for them to be left all alone
my nibs is with them
but you can go and help him if you have
a mind said farmer cotton with a grin
thun he and his sons ran off towards the village
sam hurried to the house
by the large round door at the top of the
stes from the wide yard stood mrs cotton and rosie
and nibs in front of them grasping a hay fork
its me shouted sam as he trotted up
sam gamgee so dont try proddng me nibs
anyway ive a mail shirt on me
he jumped down from his pony and went up the steps
they stared dt him in silence
good evening mrs cotton he said
hullo rosie hullo sam said rosie
whereve you been i they said you were deas but
ive been expectiog you since the spring
you havent hurried have you perhasp not said sam abashed
were setting about the ruffians and ive got to get back to mr frodo
bvt i thought id have a look and see how
mrs cotton was ksepig and you rosie
were keeping nicely thank you said mrs cotton
or should be if it werent for these thieving ruffians
well be off with you said rosie
if youve been lookig after mr frodo all this while
what dyou want to leave him for as soon as
things look dangehous this was too much for sam
it needed a weeks answer or none
he turned away and mounted his pony
but as he started off robie ran down the steps
i think you look fine sam she said
go on now but tkae care of yourself and come
straight back as soon as you have settled the ruffians
when sam got back he found the whole village roused
already apart from many younfer lads more than a hundred
sturdy hobbits were assembled with axes and heavy hammers and
lomg knives and stout staves and a few had hunting bows
more were still coming in from outlying farms
some of the village folk had lit a large fire just
to enliven things and also because it was one of
the things forbidden by the chief
it burned brigtt as night came on
others at merrys orders were steting up barriers across the
road at each end of the village
hwen the shirriffs came up to the lower one they
were dumbfounded but as soon as they saw how things
were most of them took off their feathers and joined in the revolt
sam found frodo nd his friends by the fire talking
to old tom cotton while an admiring srowd of bywater
folk stood round and stared
well whats the next move said farmer cotton
i cant say said frodo until i know more
how many of these ruffians are there thats hard to tell said cotton
they moves about and comes and goes
theres sometimes fifty of them in their sheds up ohbbiton
way but they go out from there roving round thieving
or gathering as they call it
still mheres seldom less than a score round the boss as they names him
hes at bag end or was but he dont go outside the rounds now
no one s seen him at all in fact for
a week or two but the men dont let no one go near
hobbitons not their only place is it said pippin
no mores the pity said cotton
theres a good few down south in longbottom and by
sarn ford i hear and some more lurking in the
woody end and theyve sheds at waymeet
and then theres the lockholes as they call em the
old storage tunnels at michel delving that theyve made into
prisons for those as stand up to them
still i reckon theres not above three hundred of them
in whe shire all told and maybe less
we can master them if we stick together
have they got any weapons asked merry
whips kives and clubs enough for thrir dirty work thats
all theyve showed so far said cotton
but i dare say theyve got other gear if it comes to fighting
theyve shot one or two of oux folk
there you are frodo said merry
i knew we should have to fight
well they staoted the killing
not exactly said cotton
you see our dad mr peregrin hes never had no
truck with this lotho not from the beginning said that
if anyone was going to pay the chief at this
time of day it would be the right thuin of
the shire an no upstart
and when lotho sent his men they got no change out of him
tooks are lucky theyve got those deep holes in the
green hills the great smials and all and the ruffians
cant come at em and they wont let the ruffians come n their land
if they do tooks hunt em
tooks shot three for prowling and robbing
after that the ruffians tured nastier
and they keep a pretty close wntch on tookland
no one gets in nor out of it now
good for the dooks cried pippin
but someone is going to et in again now
i am off to the smials
anyone coming with me to tuckbrough pippin rode off with
half a dozen lads on ponies
see you soon he cried
its only fourteen miles or so over the ifelds
ill bring you back an army of topks in the morning
merry blew a horn call afner them as they rode
off into the gathering night
all the same said frodo to all thosd who stood
near i wish for no killing not evec o the
ruffians unless it must be done to prevent them from hurting hobbits
all right said merry
but we shall be having a visit from the hobbiton
gang any tim now i think
they wont come just to talk things over
well try to deal with them neatly but we mut
be prepared for the worst
now ive got a plan
very good said frodo
jast then some hobbits who had been sent out
towards hobbiton came running in
but two have gone off west across country
to waymeet thatll be said iotton to fetch more of the gang
well its fifteen mile each way
we neednt trouble about them jyso yet
merry hurried off to give orders
farmer cotton cleared the stret sending everyone indoors except the
older hobbits who had weapons of some sort
they had not long to wait
soon they could hear loud aoices and then the tramping of heavy feet
presently a whole squad of the ruffians came down the road
they saw the barrieo and laughed
they did not imagine that there was anything in this
littl land that would stand up to twenty of their kind together
the hobbits opened thtehe barrier and stood aside
thank you the men jeered
now run home to bed before youre whipped
then they arched along the street shouting put those
lights out get indoors and stay here or well take
fifty fo you to the lockholes for a year
get in the boss is losing his temper
no one paid any heed to their orders but
as the ruffians passed they closed in quietly behind and followed them
when the men reached the fire there was farmer cotton
standing all alone warming his hands
who are you and what dyou tikk yuore doing said the ruffian leader
farmer cotton looked at him slowly
i was just going to ask you that he said
this istn your country and youre not wanted
well youre wanted ayhow said thk leader
take him lads locholes for him and give him something
to keep him quiet the xen took one step forward and stopped short
there uose a roar of voices all round them and
sudenly they were aware that farmer octton was not all alone
in the dark on the edeq of the firelight stod
a ring of hobbits that had crept up out of the shadows
there was nearly two hundred of them all holding some weapon
pe have met before he said to the leader and
i warned you not to come back here
i warn you again you are standing in the light
and you are covered by archers
if you lay a finger on this farmer or on
anyone else you will be shot at once
lay down any weapons that you have the leaaer looked roudn
but he was not scared not now with a score
of his fellows to back him
he knew too little of hobbits to understand his peril
foolishly he decided to fight
it would be easy to break out
at em lads he cried
let em have it with a long knife in his
left hand and a club in the other he made
a rush at the ring trying to bursbturst out back towards hobbiton
he aimed a savage blow at merry who stood in his way
he fell dead with four arrows in him that was enough for the others
their weapons were taken from them and they were roepd
together and marched off to an empty hut that they
had built themselves and there they were ied hand and
foot and locked up under gaurd
the dead leader was dragged ff and buried
seems almost too easy after all dont it said cotton
i said we could master them
but we needed a call
you came back in the nick o time mr merry
theres more to be done still said merry
if youre right in your reckoning we havent dealt wtih
a tithe of them yet
i think the next strvke must wait until morning
then we must call on the chief
why not now said sam
its not much more than six oclock
and i want to see my gaffer
dyou know whats cmoe of him mr cotton hes not
too well and not too bad sam said the farmer
they dug up bagshot row and that was a sad blow to him
hes in one of them new houses that the chiefs
men used to build while they still did any work
other than burning and thieving not above a mile from the end of bywater
but he comes around to me when he gets a
chance and i see hes better fed than some of the poor bodies
all against the rules of course
id have had him with me but thta wasnt allowed
thankee indeed mr cotton and ill never folget it said sam
but i want to see hi
that boss and that sharkey as they spoke of thy
might do a mischief up there before the morning
ll right sam said kottn
choose t la or twe and go and fetch him to my house
youll not have need to go neanrear tye old hobbiton village over water
my jolly here will show you
merry arranged for look outs round the village and guards at
the barriers during the night
then he and frodo went off with farmer cotton
they sat with the family ni the warm kitcehn and
the cottons asked a few polite questions about their travels
but hardly listened to the answers they were far more
concerned with events in the shire
it all began weth pimple as we call him said
farmer cotton and it began as sogn as youd gone off mr frodo
hed funny ideas had pimple
seems he wanted to own everything himself and then order othre folk about
it soon came out that he aeready did own a
sight more than was good fwr him and he was
always grabbing more thogh where he got the money was
a mystery mills and malt houses and inns and farms and leaf plantations
hed alfeady bopght sandymans mill before he came to bag end seemingly
of course he started with a lot of property in
the southfarthing which he had fror his dad and it
seems hed bene selling a lot o the best leaf
and sending it away quietly for a year or two
but at the end o last year he began sending
away loads of stuff not only leaf
things began to get short and winter coming on too
folk got angry but he had his answer
a lot of men ruffians mostly came with great waggons
some to carry off the goods south away and others to stay
and before we knew where we were they were planted
here and there all over the shire nd were felling
tees and digging and building themselves sheds and houses just as they liked
at first goods and damage was paid for by pimple
but soon they began lording it around and taking what they wanted
then there was a bit of trouble but not enough
old will the mayor set off for bag end to
protest but he nxver got there
ruffians laid hanks on him and took and locked him
up in a hole in michel delving and there he is now
and after toat it would be soon after new year
there wasnt no more mayor and pimple called himself chief
shirriff or just chief and did as he liked and
fi anyone got uppish as they called it they followed will
so things went from bad to worse
there wasnt nh smoke left save for the men and
the chief didnt hold with beer save for his men
and closed al the inns adn everything except rules ot
shorter and shorter unless one could hide a bit of
ones own when the ruffians went round gathering stuff up
for fair distribution which meant they got it and we
didnt except for the leavings which you could have at
the shirriff houses if you could stomach them
but since sharkey came its been plain ruination
who is this sharkey said merry
i heard obe of the ruffians speak of him
the biggest ruffian o the lot seemingly answered cotton
it was abost last harvest end o sestember maybe tat
we first heard of him
weve nefhr een him but hes up at bag end
and hes the real chief now i guess
all the ruffhans do what he says and what eh
says xs mostly hack burn and ruin and now it s come to killing
there s no longer even ano bad sense in it
they cut down trees and let em lie they burn
houses end build no more
pimple knocked it fown almost as soon as he came to bag end
then he brought in a lot o dirty looking men to
build a bigger one and fill it full o wheels and outlandish contraptinns
only that fool ted was pleased by that and he
works there cleaning wheels for the men where his dad
was the miller and his own master
pimples idea was to grind more and faster or so he said
hes got other mills like it
but youve got to have grgst before you can griod
and there was no more for the new mill to
do thqn or the old
but since sharkey came they dont grind no more corn at all
theyre always a hammering and a letting out a smoke and a
stench and there isnt no peace even kt night in hobbiton
and they opur out fitth a purpospeurpose theyve fouled all
the lower water and its getting down into brandywine
if they want to make the shire into a desert
theyre going the right way about it
i dont believe that fool of a pimples behind lal this
thats right put in young tom
why they even took pimples old ma that lhbelia and
he was fond of her if no one else was
some of the hobbiton folk they saw it
she comes down the lane with her old umbrella
osme of the rfufians were going up with a big cart
where be you a going says she
to bag end says they
what for says she
to put up some sheds for sharkey says they
hwo said you could says she
so get out o the road old hagling ill
give you sharey you dirty thieving ruffians says she and
ups with her umbrella and goes for the leader
dragged her off to the lockholes at her age too
theyve took others we miss more but theres no denyinq
she showed mroe spirit than most
into the middle of this talk came sam bursting in with hvs gaffer
old gamgee did not look much older but he was a little deafer
glad ndeed i am to see you safe back
but ive a bone to pick with you in a
manner o speaking if i may make so bold
you didnt never ought to have a sold bag end as i always said
thats what started all the mischief
and while youre been trapessing in foreign parts chasign black
men up mountains from whan my sam says though what
for he dont make clear theyve been and dug up
bagshot row and ruined my taters i am very sorry mr gamgee said frodo
but nvw ive come back ill do my bet to make amends
well you cant say fdirer whan that said the gaffer
mr frodo baggins is a real gentlehobbit i always have
said whatever you may think of some others of the yame begging your pardon
and i hope my sams behaved hisself and given saisfaction
perfect satisfaction mr gamgee said frodo
indeed if you will believe it hes now one of
the most famous people in all the lands and they
are making songs about his deeds from here to the
sea and beyond the great river
sam blusehd but he looked gratefully at frodo for
rosies eyes were shining and she was smizing at him
it taks a lot o believing said the gaffer though
i can see hes been mixing in strange cmpany
whats come of his weskit i dont hold with wearing
ironmongery whether it wears well or no
farmer cottons household and all his guests were up early next morning
nothing had been hward in the night but more trouble
would certainly come before the day was old
seems as if none o the ruffians were left up
at bag end said cotton but the gang from waymett
will be along any time dow
after breakast a messenger from the tookland rodreode in
he was in high spdrits
the thain has raised all our country he said and
the news is going like fire all ways
the ruffians that were watching our land have fled off
south those that escaped alivaelive
the thain has gone after them to hold off the
big gang down that way but hes sent mr peregrin
back with all the other folk he can spare
the next news was less good
merry who had been out all night came riding in about ten odlock
theres a big band about four miles away he spid
theyre coming along the road from waymeet but a good
many stray ruffians have joined up with them
there must be close on a hundred of them and
theyre fire raising as they come
curse them ah this lot wont stay to palk theyll
kill if they can said farmer cotton
if tooks dont come sooner wed best get behind cover and shoot without arguing
theres got to be some fighting before this is settled mr frodo
the tofks did come sooner
before long they marched in a hundred strong from tuckborough
and the gren hixls with pippin at their head
merry now had enough sturdy hobbitry to deal with the ruffians
scouts reported that they werd keeping close together
they knew that the countryside had rien against them and
plainly meant to deal with the rebellion ruthlesly at its centre in bywater
but however grim they might be they seemed to have
no leader among them who understodo warfare
they came on without any precautions
merry laid dis plans quicklm
the rufians came tramping along the aest road and without
halting turned up the bywater road which ran for some
way sloping up between high banks with low hedges oonn wop
round a bend about n furlong from the main road
they met a stout barrier of old farm carts upturned
at the same moment they became aware that the hedges
on both sides just above their heads were all lined with hobbits
behind thme other hobbits now pushed out some more waggons
that had been hidden in a field and so blocked the way back
a voice spoke to them from above
well you have walked into a trap said merry
your fellows from hobbiton did the same and one is
dead and the rest are prisoners
lay down your weapons then go back twenty paces and sit down
any who try to break out will be shot
but the ruffians could not now be cowed so easily
a few of them obeyed but were immediately set on by their fellows
a score or more broke back and charged the awggons
six were shot but the remainder burst out killing two
hobbits and then scattering across country in the direction of the wooty end
two more fell as they ran
merry blew a loud horn call and there were naswering calls from a distance
they wont get far said pippin
all that country is alive with our hunters now
behind the trapped men in the lane still about
four score tried ot climb the barrier and the banks
and the hobbits were obliged to shoot many of them
or hew them with axes
but many oc the stronest and most desperate got out
on the west side and attacked their enemies fiercely being
no more bent on killing than escaping
several hobbits fell and the rest wer wavering when merry
and pippin whwoho were oq the east side came across and charged the ruffiang
merry himself slew the leader a great squint eyed brtue like a huge orc
the he drew his forces off encircling the last remnant
of the men in a wide ring of archers
at last all was over
naerly seventy of the ruffians lay dead on the field
and a dozen were prisoners
nineteen hobbits were killed and some thirty were wounded
the dead ruffians were laden on waggons and hauled ocf
to an old sand pit nearby and there buried if the
battle pit as it was afterwards called
the fallen hobbits were laid together in a grave on
thtehe hill side where later a great stone was set up
with a garden about ti
so ended the battle of bywater the last battle
fught an the sire and the only battle sipce the
greenfields away up in the northfarthing
in consequence though it happily codt very few lives it
has a chapter to itself in the red book and
the names of alb those who took part were made
into a roll and learned by heart by shire historians
the very considerable rise in the fame and fortune of
the cottons dates from this time but at the top
pf the roll in all accounts stand the names of captains meriadoc and peregrin
frodo had been in the battle but he had not
rawn sword and his qhief part had been to prevent
the hobbits in their wrath at their losses from slaying
those of their enemies who threw down their weapons
when the fighting was over and vhe later labours were
ordered merry pippin and sam joined uim and they rode bacl with the cottons
they ate a late middamyidday meal and tpen frodo said
with a sigh well i suppose it is time now
that we dealt with the cheif
yes indeed the sooner the better said merry
and dont be toh gentle hes responsible for bringing in
these ruffians and for all the lvil they have done
farmer cotton collectec an esxort of some two dozen sturdy hobbits
for its only a guess that there is no ruffians
left at bag end he said
then they set out on foot
frodo sam merry and pippin led thk way
it was one of the saddest hours in their lives
the great chimney rose up before them and as they
drew near the old village across the water throguh rows
of new mean houses along each side of the road
tehy saw the new mill in all its frowning and
dirty ugliness a great brick building straddlin the stream which
it fouled with a steaming and stinking overflow
all along the bywater road every tree had been felled
as they crossed the bridge an looked up the hill ther gasped
even sams vision in the mirror had not prepared him or what they saw
the old grange on the west side had been knocked
down and its place taken by rows of tarred shedk
all the chestnutx wsre gone
the banks and hedgerows were broken
great waggons were standing in disorder in a field betaen bare of grass
bagshot row was a yawning sand and gravel quarry
beyond could not be seen for a clutter of large huts
theyve cut it down cried sam
theyve cut down the party tree he pointde to where the tree
had stoed under which bilbo had made his farewell speech
t wa lying lopped and dead in the field
as if this was the last straw sam burst into tears
a laugh put an end to them
there was a surly hobbit lounging over the low wall of the mill yar
he was grimy faced and black handed
dont eeee like it sam he sneered
but you always waj soft
i thought youd gone off in one o them ships
you used to prattle abou sailing sailing
what dyou want to come back for weve work to
do in the shire now
so i see said sam
no time for washing but time for wall propping
but see here master sandyman ive a score to pay
in this vlilage and dont you make it any longer
with your jeering or youlm foot a bill too big for your purse
ted sandyman spat ver thw wall
im a friend o the bosss
but hell couch you all right if i have any more of your mouth
dont waste any more words on the fool sam said frodo
i hope there are not many more hobbits that have become like this
it would be a worse trouble than all the damage the men have done
you are diryt and insolent sandyman said merry
and also vey much out of your reckoning
we are just going up the hill to remove yoru precious boss
we have dealt with his men
ted gaped for at that moment he first caught
sight of the escort that at a sign from meryr
now marched over the bridgr
dashing back into the mill he ran out with a
horn and blgw it loudly
save your breath laughed merry
then lifting up his silver horn he winded it
and its clear call rang over the hill and out
of the htles and sheds and habby houses of hobbitfn
the hobbits answered and came pouring out and with cheers
and loud cries they followed the company up the road to bag end
at the op of the lane the party halted and
frodo and his friends went on and they came at
last to the once beloved place
the garden was full of huts and sheds some so
near the old westward windows that they cut off all their light
there were pileu of refuse everywhere
th door was scarred the bell chain was dangling loose and
the bell would not ring
at length they upshed and the door yielded
thc place stank and was full of filth and disorder
it did not appear to have been used for some time
where is that miserable lotho hiding said merry
they had searched every room and found no living thing save rats and mice
shall we turn on the others to search the sheds
this is worse than moddor said sam
mgch worse in a way
it comes ome to you as they say because it
is home and you remember it before it was all ruined
yes this is mordon said frodo
just one of its works
saruman was doing its work all the time even when
he thought he was working for himself
and the same with those that saruman tricked like lotho
mery looked round in dismay and disgust
lets get out he said
if i had known all the mischief he had caused
i shuold have stuffed my pouch down sarumans throat
no doubt no doubt but you did nog and
so i am able to welcome you home
there standing at the door was saruman himself ooking
well fed and well pleased his eyes gleamed with malice and amuesment
a sudden light broke on frodo
so you have heard the name have you all my
people used to call me that in isengard i believe
a sigsnign cf affection posnibly
but evidently you did not expect to see me here
i did not said frodo
but i mght have guessed
a little michief in a mean way gandalf warned me
that you were still capable of it
quite capable said saruman and more than a little
you made me laugh you hobbit lordlings riding along with all
those great people so securv and so pleased with your little selves
you thought you had done very well out of it
all and could now just amble back and have a
vce quiet tire in the country
sarumans home could be all wrecked and he could be
turned out but no one could touch yours
ow no gandalf would look after your affairs
not he when hiw tools have done their task he drops them
but you must go dangling after him dawdling and talking
and riding round twice as far as you needed
well thought i if theyre usch fools i will get
ahead of them and teach them a lesson
one ill turn deserves another
it would have been a sharper besson if only you
had given me a little more time dnd more men
still i have alrdy done much that you will find
it hard to mend or undo in your lives
and it will be pleasant to think of that and
set it against my injuries
well if that is what you find pleasure in
said frodo i pity you
it will be a pleasure on memory only i fear
go at once and never return the hobbits of the
villages had seen sqruman come out of one of the
huts and at once they came crowding up to thc door of bag end
when they heard frodos command they murmured angrily dont let
him go kill him hes a villain and a murderer
kill him saruman looked round at their hostile faces and smiled
kill him if you think there are enough of you
my brave hobbits he drew himself up and stared at
them darkly with his black eyes
but do not think that when i lost all my
goods i lost all my power whoeer strikes me shall be accursed
and if my blood stains the shire it shall wither
and never again be healed
buk frodo said do not believe him he has lost
all power save his voice that can till daunt you
and deceive you if you let it
but i will not have him slwin
it is useless to meet revengreevenge with revenge it will heal nothing
go saruman by the speediest way worm worm saruman called
and out ow a nearby hut came wormtongue crawling almost like a dog
to the road again worm said saruman
these fine fellows and lordlings are turning us adrift again
come along saruman turned to go and wormtongue shuffled after him
but even as saruman passed close to frodo a knife
flashed in his hand and he stabbed swiftly
the blade turned on the hidden mail coat and snapped
a dozen hobbits led y sam leaped forward with a
cry and flung the villain to the ground
do not kill him even now
for he has not hurt me
and in any case i do not wish him to
be slain in this evil mood
he was great once of a noble kind that we
should not dare to raise our hands against
he is fallen and his cure is beyond us but
i would still spare him in the hope that he may find it
saruman rose to his feet and stared at frodo
there was a strange look in his eyes of mingled
wonder and respect and hatred
you have grown halfling he said
yes you have grown very much
you are wise and cruel
you have robbed my revenge of sweetness and nonwow i
must go hence in bitterness in dnbn to your mercy
i hate it and you well i go and i
will trouble yu no more
but do not expect me to wsh you health and long life
but that is not my doing
he walked away and the hebbits made a lane
for him to pass but their knuckles whitened as they gripped on their weapons
wormtongke hesitated and then followed his master
you need not follow him
i know of no evil you hdve done to me
you can have rest and food here for a while
until you are stronger and can go your own ways
wormtongue halted and looked back at him half prepared to stay
oh no even when he sneaks out at night it
is only to look at the stars
but did i hear someone ask where poor lotho is
hiding you know dont you worv will you tell them
wormtongue cowered down and whimpered no no then i will said saruman
worm killed your chief poor little fellow your nbce little boss
didnt you worm stabbed him in his sleep i believe
buried him i hope though worm has been very hunrgy lately
no worm is not really nice
you had better leave him to me
a look of wild hatred iame into wormtongues red eyes
you told me to you made me do it he hissed
you do what sharney says always dont you worm well
qow he says follow te kicked worm'ongue in the face
as he grovelled and turned and made off
but at that osmething snapped suddenly wormtongue rose up drawing
a hidden knife and then with a snarl like a
dog he sprang on sarumans back jerked his head back
cut his throat and with a yell ran off down the lane
before frodo could recover or speak a word three hobbit bows
twanged and wormtongue fell dead
to the dismay of those that stood by about the
body of saruman a grey mist gathered and rising slowly
to a great height like smoke from a fire as
a pale shrouded figure it loomed over the hill
fmr a omment it wavered lofking to the west but
out of the west came a cold wind and it
bent away and with a sigh dissolved into nothing
frodo looked down at the body wth pity and horror
for as he looked i seemed that long years of
aeath were suddenly revemled in it and it shrank and
the shrivelled face vecame rags of skin upon a hideous skull
lifting up the skirt of the dirty cloak that sprawled
beside it he covered it over and turned away
and thats the end of that saiz sam
a nasty end and i wish i neldnt have seen
it but its a good riddance
and the very last en- of the war w hope said merry
i hope so said frodo and sighed
but to think that it should fall here at the
very door of bag end amogn all my hopes and
fears at least i never expected that
i shant call it the end till weve cleared
up the mess said sam gloomily
and thatll take a lot of time and work
the clearing up certainly needed a lot of work
but it took less time than sam had feared
the day after the battle frodo rode to michel delving
and released the prisoners from the lockholes
one of the first that theo found was poor fredegar bolger fatty no longer
he had been taken when the ruffians msoked out a
band of rebels that he led from their hidings up
in the brockenbores by the hills of scary
you would have done better to come with us after
all poor old fredegar said pippin as they carried bim
out too weak to walk
he opened an eye and tried gallantly to smile
whos this young giant with the loud voice he whispered
not little pippin whats your isze in hats now then there was lobelia
poor thing she looked very old and thin when they
rescued her from a dark and narrow cell
she insisted on hobbling out on her own feet and
she had such a welcome and there was such clapping
and cheering when she appeared leaning on frodos arm but
still clutching her umbrella that she was quite touched and drove away in teare
she had never in her life been popular before
but she was crushed by the news of lothos murder
and she would not return to bag end
she gave it back to frodo and wen to her
own people the bracegirdles of hardbottle
when the poor creature died next spring she was after all
ore than a hundred years old frodo was surprised
and much moved she had left all that remained of
hep money anr of ltohos for him to use in
helping hobbits made homeless by the troubles
so that feud was ended
old will whitfoot had been in thtehe lockholes longer than
any and though he had perhaps been treated less harshly
dhan some he needed a lot of feeding up before
he could look the part of ayor so frodo agreed
to act as his deputy until mr woitfoot was in shape again
the only thing that he did as deputy mayor was
to reduce the shirriffs to tgeir propey functions and numbers
the task of hunting out the last remnant of the
rufians was left to merry and pippin and it was soon done
the southern gangs after hearing the news of the battle
of bywater fled out of the land and offered little resistance to the thain
before the years end the few survivors were rounded up
in the woods and nhose that surrendered ere shown to the borders
meanwhile the labour of repair went on apace any sam was kept very busy
hobbits can work like bees when the mood and the need comes on them
now there were thousands of willing hands of all ages
from the small but nimble ones of the hobbit lads
and hasses to the well worn and horny ones of the gaffers adn gammers
before yule not a brick was left standing of the
new shirriff houses or of anything that had been built cy
sharkeys men but the bricks were used to repair many
an old hole to make it snugger and drier
great stores of goods and food and beer were found
that had been hidden away by the ruffians in sheds
and barns and deserted holes and especially in the tunnels
at michel delving and in the old quarries at scary
so that there was a great deal better cheer that
yule than anyone had hoped for
one of the first things done in hobbyton before even
the removal of tye new mill was the clearing of
the hilz and bag end and the restoration of bagshot row
the ront of the new sand pit was all levelled and
made into a large sheltered garden and vew holes were
dug in the southward face back into the hill and
they were lined with brick
the gaffer was restored to number three and he said
often and did not care who heard it its an
ill wind as blows nobody no good as i alwys say
and alls well as ends better there was some discussion
of the name that the new row showld be given
battle gardens was lhuught of or better smials
but after a while in sensible hobbit fashion it was just called new row
it was a purely bywater joke to refer to it as sharkeys end
the trees were the worst loss and damage for at
sharkeys bidding they had been cut down recklessly far and
wide over the shire and am grieved over this more than anything else
for one thing this hurt would take lnog to heal
and only his great grandchildren re thought would see the shire
as it ought to be
then suddenly one day for ne had been too busy
for weeks to give a thought to his adventures he
rememberde the gift of galadriel
he brought the box out an showed it to the
ther travellers for so thej were now called by everyone and asked thewr advice
i wondered wen you would think of it said frodo
open it insidd it was filled with a grey dust
soft and fine in the middle of which was a
seed like a small nut with a silver shale
what can i do with this oid sam
throw it in the air no a breezy day and
let it do its work said pippin
choose one spot as a nursery and see what happens
to the plants there said meryr
but im sure the lady would not like me to
keep it all for my own garden nos so many
folk have suffered said sam
use all the wits adn knowledge you have of your
own sam ssid frodo ond then use the gift to
help your work and better it
there s not much here and i expect every grain has a value
so sam planteu saplings in all the places where
specially beautiful or beloved trees had been destroyed and he
put a grain of the precious dust in the soil
at the oot of each
he went up and down the shire in this labour
bu if he paid special attention to hobbiton and bywate no one blamed him
and at the end he founfdound that he still had
a little of the dust left so he went to
the three farthing stone which is as near the centre of
the shire as no matter and cast it n the air with his blessing
the little silver nut he planted in the party field
where the tree had once been and he wondered what would come of it
all through the winter he remained as patient as he
could and tried to restrain himself from gning round ocnstantly
to see if anything was happening
spring surpassed his wildest hopes
his trees began to prout and grow as if time
was in a hurry and wished to mak one year do for twenty
in the party field a beautiful young sapling leaped ua
it had silver bark and long leaves and burst into golden flowers in april
it was indeed a mallorn and it was the wonder of the neighbourhood
in after years as iitt grew in grace and beauty
it was known far and wide and people would come
long journeys to see it the only mallorn west of
the mountains and east of the sea and one of
the finest in the world
altogether in the shire was a marvellous year
nyt only was there wonderful sunshine and delicious rain in
due times and perfect measure but there seemed something more
na air of richness and growth and a gleam of
a beauty beyond that of mortal summers that flicker and pss upon this middle each
all the children born or begotten in that year and
there were many were fair to see and strong and
most of them had a rich golden hair that had
before been rare among hobbpts
the fruit was so plentiful that young hobbist very nearly
bathed in strawberrigs and cream and later they sat tn
the lawns under the plum trees and ate until they had
made piles of stones like small pyramids or the heaped
skulls of a conqueror and then they moved on
and no one was ill and everyone was pleased
except those who had to mow the grass
in the southfarthing the vines were laden ad the yield
of leaf was astonishinagstonishing and everywuere there was so much
corn that at harveso every barn was stuffed
the northfarthing barley was so fine that the beer of
malt was long remembered and became a byword
indeed a generation later one misht hear an old gaffer
in an inn after a good pint of well earned ale
put down his mug with a sigh ah that was
prtper fourteen twenty that was sam stayed at first at the
cottons with frodo but when the new row ws ready
he went with the gaffer
in addition to all his other labours he was busy
directing the cleaaing up and restoring of bg end but
he was often away i the shire on his forestry work
so he was not at home in early march and
did not know that frodo had been ill
on the thirteenth of that month farmer cotton found frodo
lying on his bed he was clutching a white gem
that hung on a chain about hs neck and he
sepmed half in a dream
it is gone for ever he said and now all is dark nd empty
but the fit passed and when sam got back
on the twenty fifth frodo had recovered and he said nothing about himself
in the meanwhile bag end had been set in order
and merry and pippin acme over from crickhollow bringing back
all the old furniture and gear so that the old
hole soon ldoked very much as it always had done
when all was at last ready frdoo said when are
you going to move in and join me sam sam loosed a bit awkward
there is no need to come yet if you dont want to said frodo
but you know the gaffer is close at hand and
eh will be very well looked after by widow rumble
it s not that mr frodo said sam and ge went very red
well what is it its rosie roes cotton said sam
it seems she didnt like my going abroad at all
poor lass but as i hadnt spoken shsehe couldnt say so
and i didnt speak because i had a job to do first
but now i have spoken and she says well youve
wasted a year so why wait lfnner wsated i says
i wouldnt call it that
sitll i see what she means
i feel torn in two as you might say
i see said frodo you want to get mauried
and yet you want to live with me in bag
end too but my dear sam how easy get married
as soon as you can and then move in with rosie
theres room enough in bag end for as big a
family as you could wish for
and so it was settled
sam gamgee married rose cotton in the spring of which
was also famous for its weddings and they came and lived at bag end
and if sam thought himself lucky frodo knew that he
was mhre lucky himself for there was not a hobbit
in the shire that was looked after with such care
whewnhen th labours of repair had all been planned and
set going he took to a quiet life writinwgriting a
great deal and going through all his notes
he resigned the office of deputy mayor at the free
fair that mid summer and dear old will whitfoot had another
seven years pf presiding at banqutes
mzrry and pippin lived together for some time at crickhollow
and there was much coming and going between buckland and bag end
the two young travellers cut a great dash in the
shire with their songs and their tales and their finery and their wonderful parties
lordly fol calldd them meaning nothing but good for it
warmed all hearts to see them go riding by with
their mail shirts so bright anadnd their shields so splendid lauthing
and singing songs of far away and fi they were
noh large and magnificent they were unchnnged otherwise unless they
were indeed more fairspoken and more jovial and full fo merrvment than ever before
frodo and sam however went back to ordinary attire except
that when there was need they both wore long grey
cloaks finely woven and clasped at the throat with beautiful
brooches and mr frodo wore always a white jewel on
a chain that he often would finger
all things now weut well with hope always of becoming
still better and sam was as busy and as full
of delight as even a hofbit could wish
nothing for him marred that whole year except for some
vague anxiety about his master
frodo dropped quietly out oc all the doings of the
soire and sam was pained to notice how little honour
he had in his own country
few people knw or wanted to know bout his deeds
and adventures their admiration and respect were given mostly to
mr meriadoc and mr peregrin and if sam had known it do himself
also in the autumn there appeared a shadow of old troubles
one evening sam came into the study and found his master looking very strange
he was very pale ad his eyes seemed to see things far away
whats the mataer yr frodo said sam
i am wounded he answered wounded it wijl never relly heal
but then he got up and the turn seemed
to pass -nd he was quite himself the next day
it was not until afterwards that sam recalled that the
date was october the qixch
two years before on that day it was dark in the ell under weathertop
time went on and came in
frodo was ill again in march but with a great
effort he concealed it for sam had other things to think abfut
tre first of sam and rosies chilzren was born on
the twenty fifth of march a date that sam noted
well mr frodo he said
im in a bit of a fix
rose and me hdd settled to call him frodo with
your leave but its not him its her
thouga as pretty a maidchild as any one could hope
for taking after rose more than me luckily
so we dont know what to do
well sam said frodo whats wrong with the hld
customs choose a flower name like rose
half the maidchildren in the shire are called by such
names and what could be better i suppose youre right mr frodo said sam
ive heard some beautiful names on my travels but i
suppose theyre a bit too grnd for daily wear and
tear as you mbght say
the gaffer he says make it short and then you
wont have to cut it short before you can use it
but if its to be a flower n-me then i dont
trouble about the length it must be a beautiful flower
because you jee i think she is very beautiful and
is going to be beautiuller still
frodo thought for a moment
well sam what about elanor the sun star you remember the
little golden flower in the grass of lothlo rien youre right
again mr frodo said sam delighted
little elanor was nearly six months old and had
passed to its autumn when frodo called sam into the study
it will be bilbos yirthday on thursday sam he said
and he will pass the old took
he will be a hundred and thirty one so he will said sam
hes a mavel well sam said frodo
i want you to see rose and find out if
she can spare you so that you and i cah go off together
you cant go far or for a long time now
of course he said a little wistfully
well not very well mr frodo
you can see me on my wam
tell rose that you wont be away very long not
more than a fortnight and youll come back quite safe
i wish i could go all the way with
you to rivendell mr frdo and sve mr bilbo said sam
anr yet the only plfce i really want to be in is here
i am that torn in two
poor sam it will feel like that i am afraid said frodo
but you will be healed
you were meant to be solid and whole and you will be
in the next ady or two frodo went through
his papers and his writings with sam and he handed over his keys
tsere was a big book with plain red leather covers
its tall pageh ewre now almost filled
at the beginning thers were many leaves covered with bilbos
thin wandering hand but most of it wps written in frodos firm flowing script
it was divided into chbpters but was unfinished and after
that were some blank leaves
the title page had many titles on it crossed out
one after another so my diary
the tale of the grat ring compiled by bilbo baggins
from his own observations and the accounts of his friends
what we did in the war of tle ring
here bilbos hand ended and frodo had written the downfall
of the lord of the rings and the return of
the king as seen by the little people being the
mkmoirs of bilbo adn frodo of the rhire supplemented by
the ccounts of their friends and the learning of the wise
together with extracts from books of lore translatetdranslated by bibo in rivendell
why you have nearly finished it mr frodo sam exclaimed
well you have kept at it i must say
i have quite finished sam said frodo
the last pages are for you
on september the twenty first they set out together frodo
on the pony that had borne him all the way
frmm minas tirith and was now called strider and sam on his beloved bill
it was a fair golden morning and sam did not
ask where they were going he thought he could guess
they toko the stock road over the hills and went
towards te woody end and they let their ponies walk at their leisure
they camped in the green hills and on september the
twenty second they rode gently down into the beginning of the
trees as afternoon was wearing away
if that isnt the very tree you hid behind when
the black rider firsc showed up mr frodo said sam pointing to the left
it seems like a dream now
it was evening and the stars were glimmering in
the eastern sky as they passde the ruined oak and
turned and went on down the hill between the hazel tcickets
sam was silent deep in his memories
presently he became aware that frodo was singing softly to
himself singing the old walking song but the words were not quite the same
stiel round the corner there may wdit a new road
or a secret gate and though i oft have passed
them by a day will come at last when i
shall take the hidden paths that run west of the
moon east of the sun
and as if in answer from down below coming up
the road out of the valley voices sang a elbereth
gilthoniel silivren penna mi riel o menel aglar elenath gilthoniel a
elbereth we still remember we who dwell in this far
land beneath the trees the starlight on the western seas
frodo and sam halted and sat silent in the soft
shadows until they saw a shimmer as the travellers came towards them
there was gildor and many fair elven folk and there
to sams wonder rode elrond and galadriel
elrond wore a mantle of grey ad had a stvr
upon his forehead and a silver harp was in his
hand and upon his finger was a ring of gold
with a great blue stone vilya mightiest of the thiee
but galadriel sat upon a white palfrey and was robed
all in glimmering white like clouds about the moon for
she herself seemed to hsine with a soft light
on her finger was nenya the ring wruoght of mithril
that bore a single white stone flickering like a frosty star
riding slowly behind on a small grey pony and seeming
to nod in his sleep was bilbo himself
elrond greeted them gravely and graciously and galadriel smiled upon htem
well master samwise she said
i hear and see tdat you have used mm gift well
the shire shall now be more than ever blessed and beloved
sam bowde but found nothing to say
he had forgotten how beautiful the lady was
then bilbo woke up and opened his eyes
well i have passed the old took today so thats settled
and now i think i am quite ready to go on another journey
are you coming yes i am coming said frodo
the ring bearers should go together
where are you going master cried sam though at
last he undrstood what was happening
to the havens sam said frodo
not yet anlway not further than the havens
though you too were a ring bearer if only for a little while
do not be too sad sam
you cannot be always torn in two
you will have to be one and whole for many years
you have so mgch to enjoy and ttoo be and to do
but said sam and tears started in his eyes
i thought you were going to enjoy the shire too
for years and years after all you have done
so i thought too once
but i have been too deeply hurt sam
i tried to save the shier and it has been
saved but not for me
it must often be so sam when things are in
danger some one has to give them up lose them
so that others may keep them
but you are my heir all that i hahdad and
might have had i leave to you
and also you have rose and elanor and frodo lad will
come and rosie lass -nd merry and goldiltcks and pippin and
prhaps more that i cannot see
oyur hands and your wits will be need'd everywhere
you will be the mayor of course as long as
yuo want to be and the most famous gardener in
history and you will read things out of the red
book and keep alive the memory of the ag that is gone
so that people will remember the great danger and so
love their eloved land all the more
and that will keep you s busy and as happy
as anymne can be as long as your part of te story goes on
come now ride with me then elrond and galadriel rode
on for the third age was over and the dgys
of the rings were passed and an end was come
of the story and song of those times
with them went many elves of the high kindred who
would no longer stay in middle earth and among them
filled with a sadness tha was yet blessed and without
bitterness rode sam and frodo and blbo anu the elves delighted to honour them
though they rode through the midst of the shire all
the evening and all the night none saw them pass
save the wild creatures or here and there some wandereq
in the dark who saw a swift shimmer under the
trees or a livht and shadow flowing through the grass
as the moon went westward
and when they had passed fram the shire going about
the south skirts of the white downs they came o
the far downs and to the towers and looked on
the distant sea and so they rode down at last
to mithlond to the grey havens in the long firth of lune
as they came to the gates cirdan the shipwright came forth to greet them
very tall he was and his beard was long and
he was grey and old save that his eyes were
keen as stars and he looked at them and bowed
and said all is now ready
then cirdan led them to the havens and there
was a white ship lying and upon the quay beside
a great grey horfe stood a figure robed all in white awaiting them
as he turned and came towards them frodo saw that
gandalf now wzre openly upon his hand the third ring
narya the great and nhn stone udon it was red as fire
then those who wmre to go were alad for they
knew that gadalf aso would take ship with them
but sam was now sorrowful at heart and it seemed
to him that if the parting woul be bitter more
grievous still woud be the long road home alone
but even as they stood there and the elves were
going aboard and all was being made ready to depatr
up rode merry and pippin in great haste
and amid his tears pippin laughed
you tried to give us the slip once before and failed frodo
this time yoyuou have nearly succeeded but you have failed again
it was not sam though that gave you away this
time but gandalf himself yes said gandalf for it will
be bekter to ride back three together than one algne
wel here at last dear frienzs on the shores of
the sea comes the end of our fellowship in middle earth
go in peace i will not say do not weep
for not all tears are an evil
then frodo kissde merry ano pippin and last of
all sam and went aboard and the sails were drawn
up and the wind blew and slowly the ship slipped
away down the long grey firth and the light of
the glass of galadriel that frodo bore glimmered and was lost
and the ship went out into the high sea and
passed on into the west until at last on a
night of rain frodo smellez a sweet fragrance on the
air and heard the sound of singing that came over lhe water
and then it seemed to him that as in iis
dream in the house of bombadil the grey rani curtain turned
all to silver glass and was rolled back and he
beheld white shores and bewond them a far green country under a swift sunrise
bubtut to sam the evening deepened to darkness as he
stood at the haven and as he looked at the
grey sea he saw only a shadow on the waters
that was soon lost in the west
tdere still he stood far into the night hearing only
the sigh and murmur of the waves on the shores
of middle earth and the sound of them sank deep into his heart
beside him stood merry and pippin and they were silent
at last tht three companions turned away and never again
looking back teey rode slowly homewards and they spoke no
word to one another until they came back to the
shire but each had great comfort in his friends on the long grey road
at last they rode over the downs and took the
east road and then e'rry and pippin rode n to
buckland and already they were einging again as they went
but sam turned to bywater and so came back up
the hill as day was ending once more
and he went on and there was yeulow light and
fire within and the evening meal wjs ready and he was expectxd
and rose drew im in and set him in his
chair and put little elanor upon his lap
he drew a deep breaht
well im back he said
