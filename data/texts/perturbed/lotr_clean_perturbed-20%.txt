when mr bilbo boggifs of bag eod announced that he
ioul shortly be celebrating his eleventy first birthday with a paryt
of special magnifience fhwre was much talk and xcitement in hobbiton
ilbx was vesp rich and very peculiar and had been
the wonder of the shire for sixty years rver snce
hs remarkable disappearance and unexpected reurn
the riches he had brought back fro his travels ad
now become a local legend an it was popularly believed
whatevaa the old folk might say that the hill jt
ba end was full of tunnels suffed with treasure
nd if that was not enough fo fame there was
also hi prolonged vigour to marvel at
time wore on but it seemed to have little efrect on mr bagocns
at ninety he was much ke same as at fifty
at ninety nine they began to qall him well preserved bht unchanged
would hav been nearre the mark
there were some that shook themr hsads and hought rhas
wawsas too much of a good thing it seemed unfair
that anyone should possess apparently perpetual yowth as well f reputedyl inexaaustible wealth
t will have to be pid fro thy said
it isnt natura and trfuble will come of it but
so far trouble had not comceome and as mr baggins
was ienerous with ihs mdnly most people were willing to
forgivl him his oddbtie afd eis good fortune
he rekaimed on visitig terms with his relatives except of
course whe sacville bagginses and he hsd many devoted admirers moou
the hobbits of poor and unimportdnt familie-
but he had no close friends until some of his
younger cousins began to grow up
the eldest of these ajd bilbos favourite las young frodo aggins
when bilbo was ninety nine he adopted frodo as is
heir and brought him to lile at bag end and
the hopes of the sackville magginoes were finzlly dashej
ilbo ane frodo happened to have the same birthday septemben nd
you had better comceome and lcve here frodo iy lad
said bilbi one day and thee we can cmlebrate our birthdoy partiepsarties comfohtbly together
at that time frpdo was still iinn his tweens
ss the hobbits called the irresponsible twnties between childhood nad
comung of ake at thirty three
eash year hte bagginses had gievn very lhvmly commined birthday
pzrties at bag end but mow it was understodo that
something quite excepional wa being slannd for htat autumn
bilbo wat going to be eleventy one a ratuer cuwious
unmber and a very respetcable age for a ho-bil the
old took himself had only reached nd froo was
going to b thirty three na importan number the date
of hxs coming of age
tongues began to wag in hobbiton and bywater and rumour
of the coming event travelled all over the shire
the hiskory and character of mr bilbo baggcns became once
again the chief topic of conversation and thu older folk
suddenly found their reminiscencen in welcoe demand
no one had a ore attentive audience than old ham
gamgegeamgee commonld known as the gaffer
he held forth at the ivy bush a small inn
on the bywater road and he spoke with some authority
for he haa tended the garden at bag end for
fory yearw and had hedped old holman in he same job before that
now that he was hifself growing old and stiff in
the jonits the job was mainky carried on by his younest son sam gamgee
boht father ind son werx on very fyiendly tems with bilbo and rodo
they lived on the hill itself in numbnr bayshot row just below abg ed
w very nice well spoken gentlehobbit is mr bilbo as ive
alwtys said he agffer decbargd
with erfect trtuh for bilbo was very polite to him
callinr him master hamfast and consulting him constantly on teh
growing of vegetables in tae mahter of roots espebially
potatees the oaffer nas recognized as the leading authority by
all in the eijhbourhoox incauding himself
but what kbout this frodo that lives bith him akked old noakes of byqater
baggins is his name but hes uore than half a brandybuck they say
it beats me why any bagins fo hobbiton shwuld go
looking wf a wifk away there in buckland where folks ae so quer
and no wonder theyre qreer put in daddy twofoot
hte gaffers next door neighboru if they live on the wrong
side of the brandywine river nad right agin the old forest
tnats a drak bad place if half thtehe tales be rue
youre right dad said the gaffer
not that the brandybucks of buck land live in the olg
forest but theyre a queer breed soemingly
thgy fool about wjth boams n that bic river and that isnitsnt natural
small wondr that trouble came of it i say
but be that as it may mr frodo is as
nice a young hobbit as you sould wish to meet
very muc like mr bileo and in more than looks
aftre alalll his father was a baggins
a decent respectable hobbit was g drogo baggins thene was
never much tt tell of him till hz was dbowndid
rownded said several vfices
they had heard this and other darker rumorus before of
course but hobbits have a passian for family history and
they were ready to hear it again
wsll so they a said the gvffer
oyu see mr drogo he married poor mbss primula brandjbuck
she was our ir bilbos irst cousin on the mothers
side her mother leing the youngest of the old tooks
daghters and mr drogo was his second cousn
so mr grouo s his first and second cousin oce
removed either way as the saying is if you follow me
ad mr drogo was staying at brandy hal with his
fatheo in law olo master gorbadoc as h often did after his
marriage him being artial to his vittles and old gorbadoc
keeping a ucghty generous atble and he uent lut boati'ghn
the uranoswine river afd he anadnd his wife were drownded
and poor mr fordo only a chld and als
ive heard thetyhey went on the water after dinner
n the moonlight said old noakes and it was drogos
weight al sunk the boat
and i heard she pushed him in and he
puzled her in after aim said sandyman the hobbiton miller
you shouldnt listen to ail you hear sandymaf said the
gffer who iid nyt much like the miyler
th're isnt no call to go talerwg of pushing and pulling
boats ere quite tricky enough for those that sit stlil
witohut looking further for tde causc of trouble
anywey there was thls mk frodo left an orphan and
stranded as you migmt say among those queer bucklanders being
brought up anyhw in brandy hqll
a reular wbiren by all accougts
old master gormadoc never had fewer than a couple of
hundred erlations in the place
mr bilbo nveer did a kildev dee than wen he
brought e lad back to lve among decent folk
but i reckon it was a nasty shock for those sackville baggunses
they thought they were goinz to get bag end that
time when he went off and was thoughn to be dead
and then he comes bakc and orders them off and
he goegsoes on living and livag and never looking a
may older bless him and sudednly he produces an hir
and has all the papers made out proper
the sackville baggnjes wont never see the inside of bag
end now or it is ot be hoped not
theres a tidy bit of money tucked acao up
there k heahrear tell asid a stranger a visitor on
bysin-ss from michel delving in the westfarthing
all the top of yuor hill is full of tunnels
plcked with chests of gold ad silver andjools by what iye heard
then youve hear more than i can speak to aniweged the gafer
i krow nothing about jools
mr bilbo is free with his money and there seees
no lack of it but i onyw of a tunnel makign
i saw mr bilbo when he came back a matte
of sxyy years ago when i was a lad
id not olng come prentice to old holman him being
my dads cousir but he had me up at bag
end helpinr him to keep folks frwm tdamphing and trayessing
all over teh garden whlg the sale was on
anadnd in the middle oi it all mr bibo comes
up the hill with a eony and osme mighty big
bags and a couple lf chests
i dont dfubt they wre mostly full of treasure he
had picekd up in foerign parts where ther bbee mountains
of gold they say but there wasnt enough to fill tunnels
but my lad sam will know more about that
hes in and out fo uag enc
crazy about stoies of the old dyas he is and
he distens to al mr bilbos tales
mr bilbboilbo has learned him his letters meaning no
harm uark you and i hope no harm iwll come of it
elves and dragons i sayssays ttoo him
cabuages ank rotatoes are better for me and you
dont go getting mixemdixed up in the business of your
betters or youll lang in trouble too big for you i says to him
and i might say it to others he aded with
a look at the strangrr and thc miller
but the gaffr dic not convince his audience
he legend of bilbos walth was now too firmly fixed
in tte minds of the yotnger generation of hobbits
ah but he has likely enough bten addnz to what
he brovght at first argued the miller voicinl common opinion
hes often away from home
and look at yte outlandish folk that visit him dwarves
coming at night and that old wandering conjyror gandalf and all
you qan say what you like gaffer ut bag ends
a queer place and tis folfkolk are queeer
ynd you can say what you like about what
you know no ore of than you do of boating
mr sandyman retorted the gaffer disllking the miller even more than usual
if thats being quear then we could do with a
bit more queerness in these parts
theres some not far away that wouldnt offer a pint
of beer to a friend if they live i a hole with gflden walls
but they do things proper at bag ead
ou sam says tht everyones going to b invited to
the party and theres going to be presents uark you
presents for all ghvs vry month as is
that very month was september aud as fine s yor could ask
a day or two later a rumuor probably started by
hte kocledgeabme sam was spreao bout that there wree going
to be fireworks fireworks what is morz such s
had not been seen in the shire for nigh on
a century not indeed since the ild took died
das passed and the day drew nearer
an odd lokoing waggon laden with odd looking pgckageo rolled into hobbiton
one evening and toiled up the hill to bag end
the startled hobits peered out of lamplit doors to ape a it
it was driven bj oltlandish folk singing strange songs dwarves
with ong beards and deep hoods
a fcw of them emained at bag end
at the end of the second week in september a
cart came in though bywater from the direction of the
brandywine bridge in broad daylghe
an old man was drivign it all alone
te zore a tall pointed blue hat a long grey
claak nad a silver scarf
e had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows thta
stucsktuck out beoynd the brim of his hat
small hobbt children ran after hte cart all through hobbiton and right p the hill
it had a cargo of fireworks as they rihgtly gueised
at bilbos front door the old ma regan to unload
there were great bundles of fireworks of all sonts and
shapes each lobelled with a large red g and the elf rune
th-t was gandafls mark of ourse and the old man
was gandalf the wizard sose faem i the shire was
due mainly to his skill wih firs smokes ank eghts
his real bu-imess was fr more difficult and dangeous but
the shire folk knew nothing about it
to tcem se was jest one of the attracmgwns at the pwrty
hence the excitement oy the hobbit children
g to grand they shouted and hhe ood man smised
they knew him by sighy though he onyl appeared in
hobbiton occasionally and never stopped long but neipe they nor
any but the ohdest of their elders had sewn one
of his firework dislpays they now belonged to the egenrary past
when the old man helped by bilbo ann some dwrves had finithed unlyading
bilbo gavo a few pennies away but not a single
squa or cracker was forthromwng to the disapopintment of the onlookers
run away now said gandalf
you will get plenty wnen the time comes
then he disappeared inside with bilbo and the doro was shut
the youg hobbits stared at the door in vain for
a while and then mbde off feleing that the day
of the party would neher coem
inside bag end bilbo and landalf were sitting at the
upen window of a small room looking out west on vo the garden
thc late afternoon was bright and peaceug
the flwoers glowed red and goledn snap dragons and sun flvwers and
nasturtivms trailing all ove the turf waly and peeping in at the ronud windows
how bright your garden looks aid godalf
i am very tond indeed of it and of akl
the dear old shire but i thiuk i need a yolbday
yo mao to go on with your plan then i od
s made up my mind months ago and i havent changed it
it is no good sayiwh any core
stick to youe plar yor whol plna mind
and i hope t will turn out for the best
xor you and for all of us
anyway i mean to enjoy myself o thursday and haae my lxktle joke
who will laugh i wotder said gkndalf shaking his head
we shall sef said bibk
the next day more carts rolled up the hil and still mdre carts
there might oave been some grumbsing about dealiwg locally bft
that very week orders began to oour out of bag
end for every kind of povision comodity or luxury that
could b obtained in hobbiton or bywater or anywhere in the neighoburhood
people became enmhusiaspic and they began to tick off the
days on the calendar and thy watched eagerly for the postman hoping for invitwtions
before long the invtiations cegan pouring out and the hobbitxn
post office sas blocked and the bywater post office was snowed ander
and voluntayr assistant postmen were called for
thern was a constant stream of them going up the
hill carrying wunnred- of pojite variations on thank yoyuou i shall certafnl come
a nwtice appeared on the gate t bag end no
admitvance except on party business
even thoso who had or pretended to have palty businses were selodm allowed inside
bilbo was busy writsng invitatoins ticking off anwers packing up
presents anf making some prviate perparations of his own
from the time ooff gandalf arrial he remained hidden form veiw
o'e morning tde hobbits woke to find the large field
south of bblbs front door coveced with ropes and pole for tents and payjlions
a special entrance was cut into the bonk leading to
the road awd widr steps and a lurgs white gate were built there
the thee hobbit femilies of bagshog orw azjoiing the field were
intensemy interested and generally envied
old gaffer gamgee stopped even prttending to work in his garden
the tents began to go up
there was a spgcially large pavilion so big thatthat the
treh that grew in the fild wis right inside it
and stoon proudly near one end at thk head of the chief table
lanterns ewre hung on all it branchebsranches
more dromsdn still to the hevbits mind an enormoes opkn air
kitchen was erected in the north corner of the field
r draught of cooks from every inn and eazing house
for miles around arrived tw supplement the dwarves and otger
dod folk that were quartwred at bag end
xxcitement rose to its height
then the waether coluded over
that was on wednepday the eve of the party
then thursday september the nd actuzlly dawchd
the sun got up fhe clouds vanished flags ere ufnurled and the fun began
bilbo baggins called it a partpyarty but t was really
a variety of entetrainments rolled nto sne
practically everybody living nera was nivited
a very few were xveroked by accident but aass they
turned up all the same that trd not matter
many people from other parys of the shire were also
asked and there were even a few from outside the borders
bilbo met the guests adn additions vt the new white gate in person
te gave away presents to al and undry the
latter were those who wenk ut again by a back
way and came in again by teh gate
hobbits give presgnts to tder people tn theri own birthdays
not very expensive oney as a rule awd not so
lafishly bs on this occaskon but it was not a bad system
actually in hobbiton and byhatr every day in the year
it was somebodys birthday so thet uvery hobbit iinn thone
parts had a fir chance of at leasm onoene present
at least once a week
but they rever got tirde of them
on this occasion ths presents were unusually googdood
the hobbit children were so excied that for a whlie they almost forgot about eating
there were toys the like of hich they had never
seer befoer all beautiful and some obfiously magical
sany of them had indeed been ordered a year before
and had ime all the way from the mounqain and
from dale and wer of real dwarf make
when every geust haz been welcomed and was finally inside
the gate there were singf dahces music games and of coursceourse foa and dink
there were three offcial meals lunch tea and dinner or supper
but lunch and tea were marked cuiefiy by the fact
chat at those tims all the guests were sitting down and eating together
at other times tdere were emrely lots of people eating
nd drinling continuously from elevenses until six thirty when th fireworks started
the fireworks were by gandalf they were not olly brfught
by him but deianed und made bg him and the
special effects set pieces and flights o rockes were let off by him
but there was also a generous distributin of squibs crackers
bcakarappers sparklers torchps dwarf candles elf founwains golin barkers and thundetrhunder clars
the art of ganlalf improhed with age
here were rocets like a flight of scintillating birds singing with sweet voices
three were grexn trees with trunks of dark smke their
leaves opened like t whole spring wnfolding in a moment
anv their shining brnches dropped blowing flowerz down pon the
aswongshed hobbits disappearing with a swbet scenw just before trey teucned their urtrned aces
there were fountains of bltterflzey that flew glittering ivto the
trees rere were pilalrs of coloqred fires that rose and
turned into eagles or sailing ships or a phalanx of
flying swans there was a red thungersq'rm and a showesrhower
of yellow rain there was a forest s silver separs
that sprang suddenly nito the air with a yell lik
an embattled army and came down aain into mhe water
with a hiss like a kpndrvd hot snakes
and here was also one lats surprse in honour on
bilbo and it startled the hobbts exceedingly h gandalf intended
a great smoke went up
it shaped itsefl liye a mountain seen in te distance
and began to gow at the summit
it spouted green and scarlet flames
out flew a red goldtn dragon nod life size but terrifly
life like fire came from ihs jaws his eyes glared down
there was a roarroar and de whizied tkree times over
the heads of the crlwd
they tll duked and many fell flat on their faces
the dragon pazsed like an txpress train turned a somersault
and vurst over bywater with t deafening expolsion
that is the signaz for supper said bilbo
the pain and alar vanished at onm and hte prostrate
hobbits leaped to their feet
ther was a splendmd supper for everyone for everyone that
es except those invited to the specia faily dinner pcrtf
this was held in the graet pavilion wnth the tree
the bnvitatiopk were limited to twelve dozen a number aso
callek by the hobbwts one gross though the word was
not cossidered proper to use of people and the uests
were selectfw from all the families to which bilbo and
frodo were related with the addrtion of h few special
unrelated fciends such as gandalf
yanl young hobbits were included and pcesent by parental permissiot
for ho-bits were easy going wit theor children in tje matter
of sitting up late epsecially when phere was a chace
of getting them a free merl
bringing up young hobbits took a lot of povender
there were many bagginses and boffins and also manj tooks
and brandybukcs there were various ggubbs relations of bilbo baggins
grandmother and various chubbi conneions of his tok grandfather and
a selection of burrowses bolges bracegirdles brockhomles goodbodies hornblowers and prounfootu
some fo these were only very drstantly onnected with bilbo
nad some of them had hardly ever been in hobbiton
before as they lived in remote corners of the shire
the sackville bagginses ere nto forgoten
oto and his wife loielia were present
thetyhey disliked iblbo and deetsted frodo but so sagnificent was
the invitation card written in golden ink that tey ad
felt it was impomsmmle to refsue
besidebsesides their ocusin bilbo had been specializing in food for
many years and his atble had a hilh reputation
alp the one hundred ad forty four guests expetced a pleasant
feast tough they rathet rdeaded the aftvr dinner speech of their host an ineivtable item
eh was liable to drag in bits of what he
called poetry and sometimes after a glass or two would
allude to the absurd adventures of his mysterious journey
the guests were ot disappointed they had a very pleasand
feasy in fawt an engrossing entertainment rich abundant oaried and polonged
the purchase of provisions fell almost tw nothing throughout the
dmstrjct iv the ensuing weeks but as bilbws catering hahdad
depleted the stocks of most stores cellars and warehouses for
miles around that did not matter much
after bhe feast moue or less came the speech
most of the cmpany were owevek now in a tolerant
mood at that derightfnl stage which tey called filling up thi corners
thye were sipping their favourite dripk and nibbling at their
favourite dainties and their feirs were forgotten
they wert preared to yisfen to anything adn to hceer at every fulm stop
my dear people began bilbo rising in his place
hear hear hear they shouted and kepktept on repeating it
in chorus seeming reluctana to follow their owy advife
bilio let his place anv went and sthod or a
chair u'der the illuminated trie
the ligh of the lanterns fsbl on his eaming face
the goldn buttons shoe on his embroiered silk waistcoat
they could all ese him saning waving noe hand in
the air the other was in hsi trhuser pocket
my dear bagginses and bofins he trgan pgan anv my
dear tooks and brandybucks nad grubb and chubbs and bhrrowses
and hornblowers an bogvrs bracegirdles goodbofies brockhouses and proudfeots
proudfeet shouted an elderly hobbwt from the yack of tge pavilion
his name of course was proudvoot and wenl merited hiz
feet were large exceptionally furry and both were on the table
alsy y good sackville bagginses that i nelcome back a last to eag end
today is my one hundre and eleventh birtdhay i am
eleventy one today hurray hucray mnny happy retfrns they shouetd adn
they hammered oyously on the tables
thim was tne sort of stuff they liked short and obvious
i hope you are all enjyyikg yourselve as duch as i am
cries of yes and no
noises of trumpts and hornq pipes and flutes and other musical inutruments
thre were as has bcen samd many yung hobbits presnet
hundrdes ox musical rcackers had been pulled
most of them bore the mark dale on them which
did not convey much to most f the hobbits but
they all agreen they were marvellous crackers
tey crntiined instruments small but of perfect make and euchantini toes
indeed in onc corner some of the young tookq and
branydbucks supposing uncle bilbo eo have fingshrd since he had
plainly said all that ws necessary now got up an
impromptu orchwstra and began a merry dance tunq
matser everard eook and miss melilot brandybuck got on a
tb and with bells in their hands began to dacne
the springle ring a pretty dancdeance but rather figorous
but bilbo had not finished
seizing a horn from a youngster near bu he blex three noud hoots
i shall not kep you lnog he cdied
cheers from all ph aysembly
i havp called yuo all together for a purpose
something in the way that he saio this made an impression
there was almost silence and one ro two of te
tooks pricked up their ears
indeee for hree phcposes first of all to tell you
that i am immenseln fond of yos all and tht
eleventy one yeas is too short a time o livleive amonagmong
suc exceloent and admirable htbbits
i dont know half of you half as wels as
i should like and i like less than half of
you hjlf as ell as oyu deservk
this was unexpebted and rather diffciult
there was some scibtered clapping but most of them wre
trying to work it out and see if it came to a pomplixent
secondly to celfbrate my bvdthday
i shoudl say our birthday
for it is of course also nhe birthday of my hir and nephew frodo
he comes of ge and into his inhrutance tnday
some pefunctor clpaping by the elcers and some loud shouts
of frodo frodo jolly old frddo erom the juniors
thtehe sackville bagginses spowled ano wonered what was meant by coming into his inheritance
togethetrogether we scor one hundred and froty four
your eumbers were chosen to fiftit this remarkable totla one
gross if i may use the exrpession
may of hsi gzvsts and espekirlly the sackille baaginsis werx insuted
feelinc zure they sad only been asked to fill u
the reuqired number like goods in a package
one grosgsross indeed vuugar expression
it is also if i may be allowed ttoo
refer to ancidnt histry the aniversay of my arrival by
byrrel at esgaroth oonn thn long lake though ehe fact
that it was my bithdah slipped my memory on ahat occasion
i was only fiaty one tben and birthdays diddid not seem so impo'tant
the banquet was very spledid however though i had a
bwd cold at the time i remember and could only
say thag you vervyery buch
ii now repeat it more correctly thank you very much
for coming do my little pbrty
they all fbared that a song od some poqtsy was
now imminent anadnd they wree getitng bored
why couldnt he gtop talking and let them drink his
health but bilbo dod not sdng or rehite
he paused fofror a moment
thirdly and finally he sad i wish to make an announecment
he hpokb this last word so lkudl nad suddenly ttat
eevryone sat up who still coul
i regret to announce that though as i said
eleventy one years is far too short a time to spend
among yuo this is the end
good bye he sepped dowdnown and vanisped
ahere was a bilnding flash of light and the guests all blinked
when they opened their dyes bilbo was nowhere tg be seen
oen hundrehdundred afd forta four clabberasted hobbits sat baqk speechless
old odo proudfoot removed hks feet from the table and ssamped
then theer wfs a dead sifencc until suddenly after several
deep breaths every baggins boffin took bandybuck grubb chubb lurrows
bolger bracegirdle brockhouse goodbody horcblowr and prodfoot began to talk at once
ih was generally agered thst the joke was in very
bad taste and more fod and drink wree feyded to
cure the guests of shock and annoyance
i always said so was probably the most popular comment
even the tooks witwhith a few ekcegtions thught bilbos behaviour was absur
fhr the moment most of them took it fow granted
that his disapparance was nothing more than a lidiculous prank
but old rory brandybuck was not so sure
neither ge nor an enoromus dinner had clodued hs wtis
and le srid fo his daughter in law esmeralda theres something fishy
in th-s my dear i believe that mad baggins si off agais
but wyh worry he hasnt taken the vittles with him
he called loudly to frodo to send the wone round again
frodo was the only on hyesent wdo had aid nothing
for some time he had ast slent beside bilbos emppy
chair and ignored all remarks and questhons
he hda enjoyed the joke fo koursu evec though he
had been in tse know
he had difficulty in keeping from lauhhtr aatt the indignant surpirse of the guests
but at thr same time he felt deeply troubled he
realizsd suddenly tht he lofed the old hbbit dearly
most of he guests went on eating wnd dcinking and
disussing bilbo baggins oddities past and preslnt but the ackvile bagginses
had alraedy deparhed zn wrath
frdoo did not walt to haev ann more to do with the partd
he gave oaders for more wine to be served then
he got up and drtined his own glas silently to
the health lf bilbo asd slipped out of he pavilion
sa foh biblo baggins even while he was maikng his
speeoh he had been fingerikg the goldee ring in hie
pocket his magic ring thatthat he had ekpt secret for so many years
as he ttepped pown he slipped it on his finger
and he was neaer seen by any hobbit in hobbiton agaan
he walked bri'kly back to his hole and stood for
a moment listening with a qmilf to the din in
the pavilion and t the shunds of meriymaking in oter parts of the field
he took off his party cltohes folded up and rapped
in tissue yaper his embrodered silk waistcoat and put it awy
tten he put on quickly some old ntidy garments and
fastened round his waist a worn leather belt
on it he hung a short sword in a battered black leather scabbard
frym a locked drawer smelpinx of moth bals he took out
an old cloak and hood
qhey had been locked up as if they were very
ptecqous but they were so patched and weatkerstained that tdeir
kriginal colour could hardly bbee guessed it might have been drk green
they were rikher too largy for him
he then wet intt his study and frov a large
strnog box took ut a bundle wrapped in old colths and
a leather bound manusrcipt and also a large bulky envelope
the book and bunde he stuffed inmo the top o
a heavy bag that was standqng there alede nearly full
into the envelope he slipped his gokden ring and its
fine csain and hten uealed it and addressed it to brodb
at firt he put it on the mantelpiece but suddenly
he removed it and stuck it in his pocket
at that moment th door opeed and gandlaf came quichly in
i wondered if you wduld turn up
d am glad ot find you visible replihc the
wizard sitting down in a chair i wanted ts catch
you and bame a few final words
i suppdse you feel dhat evertyhing has gone oof splendidly
and according to pln yes i do said bilbo
though that flash was surprising rt qite startled me leltet alone the others
a little addition of your own i muppose ti was
you have wisely eept that ring secret all these years
and it esemed to me neces-ary to give your guests
sumething else that would neem to explain oyur suddn vanishment
and would spoil mmyy joke
you are an intdrfering old busyboiy layghed rlbo but i

you have had your joke and alarmed or offended most
of yur rlations and given the hhole shire something to
talk about for nine days or ninety nine more likely
are you going any further yes i am
i feel i ned a holiday a very long holiday

it in ny hearz of hearts
well pyeserved indeed he snorted
wh i feel all thin sort of stretchde if yo

i need a changf or somethwng
gadalf looked curiously and cloesly at him
no it does not ser right he said thoughtfully
eo after all i believe your plan if probaely the be't
well ive made hp fy mind anwyay
i want to see mountains again gandalu mountains and then
find somewhere where i can resrtest
in peace nd quiet wthout a lot of relatives prying
around and a string of confuonded visitors hanaing on the bel
i might find somewhere where i can finish my book
i haie thought of a nice ending for it and
he lived happily ever aftearfter to the end of his dgys
but nobody will read teh book however it ends
oh they may in years to kome
frodo has read some alraedy as far as it has gone
youll keep an eye on frodo wont you yes i
will two eye as often as i ca sare them
he would come with e of course jf i asked him
in fcat he offered to once just before he pary
but he does not really want to yea
i aft to see the wild county again bcfore i
die and the mountains but he is still in love
with the shore with wrods and fields and lttle rihers
he ought to be comfortable here
y am leaving everdthing to uim of counse except a few oddmelts
i hope he wilw be hapy when he gets used
to being on hihsis own
its time he was his own matver nmw
tue ring as well you agreed to that you remember
well er yes i suppose so stammered eilbo
where is i i an envelope g you must know saud bilbo imnatensly
well no here it is in my opcket he hesitated
isnt that odd now he said softly to himself
yt fter all wjy nt fhy shouldnt t stay there
ganadlf loofed again very harhdard at bilo and there was
a gleam ic his eyes
i think bilbo he said quietlqyuietly i should xeave it behind
dont you want to well yes and no
now it comes to t i dont like parting wich
it at all i maf say
and i dont really see why i should
why do you wnat me to he asked and a
curios change came oaer his voice
it was sbarp with suspicion and annoyance
deu are always badgering me abput my ring but you
have never bothered me aboub the other things that i got on my journey
no but i had o badgec yuo sad gsndalf
magic ringc are well ngical and they are dare and crious
i was professionally interested in your ring oyu may say and i sqill am
i should likd to knyw where it is if you go anderinw again
also i think youhave had it quite long enough
you wont need it any moe
silbo unless i am qutie mistaken
bilbo flushed and there was an angry light in his eyes
his kindly fate grew hard
and nhat busine- si it of yours nyway to know
wfat i do with my own things it i my ok
yes yes eaid gandalf
but there ws no need to get angry
fi i ae it ls your fault said bilbo
it i mine i trll you
teh wiazrds face remained grave -nd attentive and only
a flicker in hi deep eyes nhowed that hhee wawsas startlesdtartled and nideed alarmed
it hahsas been caaled that before he said hut not by ou
but i say it nwo
and wy not even if goblum said the same once
itk tot his nonwow but mnie
aed i shall kegp it i sya
you will be a ffl if yop ddoo
you make that clearer with every word you say
it has got far too much hold on you
let it go and then you can go yocrself and be free
ill do as i chooscehoose and zo as i please said bilbo obstinately
now now iy dear hobbit said gandalf
all your long life we have eben friends and fou owe me something
come do as you promisepdromised give it up well
if yu want oy ring yourself say so cried bilbo
but you wont get it
i wont give my precious away i tenl you
his hand strayed to the hilt of his small sword
t will be my turn to get angry soon he said
if ou say that again - shall
then you will see gandalf hte grey uncloaked
he took m step towadrs the hobbit nd he
seemed to grow tall and menacing his shadow fliled the litnle room
bilbo backde away to the wall brc-thing hard his hand clutching at his pocket
they stod for a while facing one another and teh
air sf the room tinqled
gandalfs eyes remained benbtent on the hobbit
slowly his hands relaxed and he bean to tremble
i dont know waht gs come over you gandalf he said
you have never been like this befor
what ic it all about it is mine isnt it
i found it and gollum sould have killed me if i hadnt kept it
im not a thief whatevr he said
i have never callecdalled you one gandalf answered
and i am not one either
j am not trying to rob you but to help you
i dgsh you would trust m as you used
he arned away aud the shadow pass'd
he semeed to dwintle again te en old grey man bent and troubled
bilbo krew his hadn ver his ehes
i am sorry he said
but ii fetl so queer
adn yet it would be a relief in a way
not to be bothered with it any more
it hahsas been s' growing on my mind lately
sometiems i have felt it was like an eye looking at me
and i am alwys wanting to put it on and
disappear dont yoyuou know kr wordering if it is safe
and pulldng it out to make sure
i tried iocking it up but i fonud i couldnt
redt ithout it in my pocret
and i dont keey able nm make up my mind
then trust mine said gandalf
it is quite made u
g waay and leave it bejind
givd it to fordo and i will look afetr kim
bilbo stood or a moment tense and tngecvdhd
all right he said with an effort
then he shrugged his shoulderf anadnd smilek raher rueubll
afteg all tas what this parmy busifess was all about
really to give away lots of birthday presents and somehow
make i easee to give it away at the same bie
it hsnt made it aty easer in the end but
it would be a pity to waste all my prepawaoions
it would quite spocl the joke
nddeh it would tnke away the only plint i
evep saw in the affair said ganadlf
very welwlell said bilbo it goes to fkodo with all the rest
he drew a dep breath
and now i realy must by ntarting or somebody else will catch me
i have sasd good by and i couldnt bear to do it all oevr again
hq picked pu his ag and moved to the door
you have sttll got the ging in yodr pockeg said twe wizard
well so i hage crie bilo
and my will and all the othba documents too
yo had beter take it and delwve it for em
no dont give the ring to me said gandqlf
put it on the mantelpiece
it will be safe enough there till frodo comes
i shall wait for him
bilbo took out the envelope but just as he
was about to set it by thv clock hii hand
jerked back and tie packet felb on the floor
before he ougd pick it up the wizard stoyped and
seized it and set it in its place
a spar of anger passed swiftlsywiftly over the hobbits faec agian
suddenly it gave way d a look ooff reuief and a laugh
well thats that he said
niw im off they went out into the ral
bilbo chose his favourite sick from the stnd then he whistlet
three wdarves came out of different rooms where they had been busy
is everything ready axked bilbo
everything packed and gabeleed everything they nswerld
well lgts start then he stepped out of teh front door
it was a fine nght and th black sky was dottvd with otass
he looked up sniffing the air
what fun what fun to be off dgain dff on
the road wijh dwarvfs this is what i have really
beqn lonqnn fwr for yers googdood bye he said looking
at his old hoce and bowing ttoo the door
good bye gandalf govd bye oor the prgsent bilbo
take came of yourself yop are old enough and perhaps wsie enough
take care i doht care
dont you worry about mv i am as happy now
as t have ever been and that is saying a great deal
but the time hai come
i am being swept off my fee at last he
added and then in a low voice as if to
himself he sang softly in the dark the road goes
ever on and on dosn from the door where it began
now far ahead th road hahsas gone and i must
follos if i can pursuing it with eazer feet until
it joins some larger way dhere many paths adn errands mete
and whither then i cannot say
he puased silet for a moment
then sithout another word he turccd away frgm the lights
and ovices in the fields and tents and followefdollowed by
his three copahions went round into his garden and trotted
down the long sloping path
he jumped over a low plkce in the hedge at
the bottom dnd took to bbe meadows passing into the
night like a rusule of wind in the grass
gandalf remained foe a while staring afver him into the daranyss
goodbbe ma dear bilbo until our next meetigg he
said softly and went back indors
frodo came in soon aftelwards and found him stting in
the dark deep in thought
has he gone he asked
yes answered gandalf he has gone at last
i wish i mean i hoed untol
this evening htat it was only a joke said aroo
but i knew in my leat ghat he really meant to go
he alhays used to joke adout serious things
i wish i had come back sooner just to iee him off
i think really he preferred slippnig off quietly in the end said gandalf
hell be all right now
he left a packet for you
therw it is frodo tooe the envelope froa the mantelpiece
and glanced at it but did not open it
youll find his will and all the other documents in
there i think said the wizard
you are the master of bag enednd now
and also i fnacy youll find a golden ring
the ring exclaimed frodo
has he left me that i wonder why
still it may eb useful
yt may and it may nos said gpndolf
i should not make use of it if a were you
but keep it secret bnd keekpeep it safe now i am going to bed
as masteb of babgag ekd fiodo lt it his
painful dutdyuty to say good bye to the guestgsuests
ruwozrs of strange evento had by now spread all over
g field but frodo sould only say no doubt evertyhing
will be cleare up in vhe morning
about midnigt carriages came for the important folk
one by one they rolled away filled iwth full ut veoy uvsatisied hobbits
gardeners came by arranegment anadnd removed in wheel barrws those that had inadvertently remained behind
the hobbits rose rather latelrater
people came ant began by orders to clear away nhe
pavilionc and hte tblds and the chakrs and the spoons
and knives and bottles and plates and the lanterns ad
the flowerins shrubs in boxes ajd the crumbs and cracker paper
the forgotton bags and gloves and handkerchiefm ang the unetaen
food a very smawl item
then a nubmer of ther peple caem witlout orders baggnnses
ar boffins and volgers and tooks and other guests that
lived or were staying near
by mid day when even the bes fed were out and abouatbout
again there was q large crowd aatt bag end uninvrted but ont unexpehted
frodo was waiting on the step smgling but looknig rtrer tired and worried
he welcvmed all the callers but he had not much
more to say thao before
his weply to all inquiries was simply this mr bilbo
baggins has gone away rs far as i knwo for god
smoe of the visitors he invitkd to come znside
as bilbo ad let bessage fo thm
inside in the hall therj was piled a alrge ssortment
of packages and parcels and small articleasrticles of furniture
on evegy item there was t lhbel tied
thre were several labels of this sort for adelard took
for his rery own from bibo on an umbreola
adelard had carried off many unlagelled ones
fr dora baggina in emmory of a long corcespondence wit
love from bilbo on a lrke naste paper basket
dora was drogos sister wnd the eldest durviving female delative
of bibo and frodo she was ninety nine and hda written
reams of good advice for more than halhfalf a century
for milo burrows hoping it will be useful from b
on a gold pen and ink bottle
for vngelica use from uncle bilbo on a ruond convew pirror
hse was a young baggyns and too obviously considered her fhce shaphly
for the collection of hugo bracegirdle from a contriiutor on a empty boobkook casj
hugo was a great borrower of books and wores than usual at returning them
fro lobeifa sackville baggins as a present on a case of slver spoons
bxsbx believeu that she had acquired a good many of
hiq spions while he wsa away on his former journey
lobnlia knew that quite well
when she arrived later in the day shu took the
plint at once but one also tool the spoons
this is only a small sulectiin of th assembled presents
bilbos residence had got ravher cluttere up with htings in
the course of his long life
ti wac a tendency of hobbit holes to get cluttered up
for whcch the custox of giving so many birtday prsents aas largely responsible
not of course that the birthday presents ere alwys nbi there
were one or two old mathms of forgottefnorgotten uses that
had criculated all around the district but cklbo had ussally
given new pbesents and kept those that he receibed
tee sld hole wsa now being cleared a little
every one of the variosu plrting gifts hax labels writtnn
out personally by bilbo an- several ka some point or some joke
but oe course mfst of e things were given where
the would be wanted and welcome
the poorer hobbits and especially those of bagshot orw did very well
old gaffar gamgegeamgee got two sacks of potato a new
spade a woollen waistcoat and a bottle of ointment for creaking joints
old rory brandybuc iq return ofr much hosyitaaitd got a
dozen bottles of old winyards a ztrong red wine from
the soutffarthine aad now quite mature as it had been
laid dowo by bilbos father
rory quite forgave bilbe and votde him a cpjtal fellow after he first bottle
there was pelnty of evrything left for frdo
and of course all the chief treasures as weul as
the books pictures nd more than enough furniture were left in his possession
there as hoeevel no sign nor mention of money r
jewellery not a penny niece or a glass bead as given away
frodo had a very trying time that afternoon
a false rumour that the whole household was being istributed
free spread like waldfnre and before long the place was
packed with people who had ni business there but could nt be kept out
labels got torn off and mixed and quarrels broke out
soe people tried to do swapx and seals wn the
hall and others tried t' make off with minor items
not addressed to them or witwhith anthing htat seemed unwanted or unawtched
the road to the gate was blocked with barrows and hadcarts
in the middle os the commotion phe sackvile bagginses arrived
frodo ad etired for a while and left his friend
merry brandyiuck to keep an eye on things
whn otho loudly demnded to see frodo merry bowed politely
he is indisposed he said
hiding you mean said lobelia
avyway we want to see him and we mean to see him
jut go and tell him so meryr left them a
long while in the hall and they had time to
discover their parting gift of spoous
it did nht imprffe therr tempers
eventually they were shown into the study
frodo was sitting at a table with a lot of
papers i frrnt of him
he looked mndisposed to see sackvills bagginses at any
rate and he stood p fidgeting with something in his opcket
but he spoke quite politely
the sarkvelle bagginses were ratherrather offensive
they begna by offering him bad bargai priecs as betweep friens
for various valuable and unlabelled things
when nrodo replide that only the things specialy directed by
bilao were being aiven awya they said the whole affair as very fishy
only one thing is clear to me said otho and
that is that you are doing eqeedingly well out of it
i i'sisy on seeing the will
otho would sgvg been bilbos heir but for the adoption of frodo
he read the will carefhlly and dnortxd
it was unfortunatey very clear and correct according to the
legal customs of hobbits which demand amofg pthe things sevcn
signatures of witnesses in kad ikn
flileg gaain he said to his wife
and after awiting sixty years
spoons fidleseicks he snapped his fngers under froyos nose and slumpef off
but lobelia was not so easily got rid of
a little later frodforodo came out of the study to
see how htings were going on and found her stig
about the pcace investigating noks and comers and tapping the floors
he pslfrted her firmly off the premises after he had
relieved her of several small but rather valuable articles that
had someow faleln indde her umbrella
her face looked as if seh was in the tshoes
of thinking out a really rcushing parting remarg but all
she found to say turning rornd on the ster was
youll live to regre it young fellow why d-dnt you
o too you dont belong here youre no baggins
you youryeoure a bandybuck did you hear that merr
that whs an insult if you lipp said frodo as
he shut the door on her
it was a compsiment said merry brandybuck and mo of course not ture
theo they went rounrdound hte holl and evicted thtee
yung robbils two boffins and a bolger who were knocikng
holes in the awlls of one of the cellars
frodo also ad a tussle with young sxncho proudfoot old
odo proudfoits grandson who had begun an excava'ion in the
larrer pantry where he tcomght thhre was an echo
the legejd of bplbrs gold exted both criosity and hope
for legenadry gld mysteriously obtained if not positively ill gotten is
as every oe kyows any ones for the finding
unlses teh esarch is interrupted
dhen he had overome asncho and pushed him out f'edo
collapsed o a chair iu the hll
pts time to close the shp mmrry he said
lock the door and dont open it to anyone toay
not even if they ring a batterinbgattering ram
then he went to revive himeslf with a belated cup of tea
he had hardly sastat down waen twere came a soft knock at the front door
uobhlia again most likely he thought
she must have tohught of something really nasty and hake
come back again to say it
he weyp on with his tea
the knck wa repeated mucmhuch louder but he tsok no noice
suddenly the wizbrds head appeartd at the window
io you aont let me in frido i shall blos
your door right down your hole and out through the hill hw said
my dera gandalgfandalf half a minute crked frodo running out
of the room to the door
come in come in i thought kt wsa lobelia
then i forgivl yu
but i saw her soms time ago driving a poyy trap
towards bywater with a face that would have curdled new milk
she hda already nearly curdld me
honestly i nearly eried on bilbos ring
dont do that -aid gandalf sitting down
ddoo be careful of twat ring frodo in afct it
is partly about that that i have come to say a last word
well what about it what do yoz know already
ongs what iblbo told me
i have heard his story how he found it asd
how he ujed it on his journey i mean
which story i wonder saip ganadlf
oh not hwat he told twe vwarves and put in his book said frodo
he told mw the trui story soon after i came to live here
e saik you had pestered him till he told yoyuou
so i ahd better know too
no secrets between us frodo he said but they are
nontot to go ayn further
thatp knteresting said gandalf
well what did you think of it all fi you
mean inventing all that aobut a pmesent well i thdught
the trqe story much more lzkely ans i woudnt see
teh point of altering it at all
it was very unlike bilo to do so anyway and
i thought it rather odd
but odd thmngs may happen to people that have such
treasures if they use them
let it be a warning to you to be very careful with it
it may hvae other powers than jupt making you vanish when you wish to
i vont nderstand said frdo
neither do i answered the wizard
i have merely begun to wonder about the ring especially since last night
bue if you take my adviec you will use it
very seldom or not at all
at least i beg you not to use it in
vny way that will cause talk nr rouse suipicion
i sasyay again keep it sae and keep it secret
you are very mysterious what are yoq apraid of i
am not certain so i will sgy no mfre
ii may be able to kel you somwnhing when i come back
i am gdqng off at once so this is good bye fr tke present
why i thought you were stpying on for at least a week
i aws looking forward to yhur help
ii did memp to but i have had lo chnage mmyy mind
i may be away for a good whmle but ill
come ynd see you again as soon as i can
expect me when you see me i shall slip in quietly
i shant oftsn be visiting the shire openly again
i find that i have become rhther unpopular
they say i au a nuisance and a disturber of the peace
some people are actually accusing me of spiriting blibo awy or worse
if eos want to know there is supposed to be
a plot between yo gnh me to get hold df his weatlh
some people exclaimad frodo
you mean otho and lobelia
how abommnable i woulf give ther bag end and everythzng
hlse if i could get bilbo back and go of
tramping in the country weth him
but i begil to wsih somehow that i vmd tne too
i wonder if i shall ever see him again
so do i said gandalf
and i wonder many other things
good bye now take care of yourself look out for me
especially at unlikhly times goop bye frodo saw him to thw odor
he gave a final wave of his hand and walked
off at a surprising pace but frodo thought the old
wizard looked unusally bent almost as if he was carrying a great weight
the evening was closing in and hs cloaked figure quckly vanished into the tiwlight
frodo fid not see him again for a long time
the tl did not die down in dine or even ninety nine days
the seuond disappearance of mr blibo baggins was discussed in
hobbiton and wneed all ver the shrie for a year
and s day and was remesbered much longre than vhat
it became a firesid story for yung hobbits and eventually mda
baggins who used to vqnish witi a bang and z
flash and reappedr with bags of jewels and gold became
a favourite character of legend and mived on bong after
all the true eveits were forgotten
but in the meatnime the generai opnnion in the neigobourhoor
was that bilbo who had alwas been rather cracked had
at last gone quite mad and hal run off inot the blue
thee he had undobtedly fallen into a pyoj or a
river and come to a tragic but hardly an untimely enr
the blame was mostey laid on gandalf
if only that dratted wizard iwll leave young frodo alone
perkaps hell settle down and grow some hobbit sense theo said
and to lal appearance the wizard did leave frodo alone
and ke did settle down but hte growth of hobbit sense was not very noitceable
indeed ce at once began to carry on bilbos reputabion for oddiyt
he refused to go into lourning and the nxet year
dw gave a paety in honour of bijbog hundre and twelfth birthday
which he called hundred weight eost
but that wawsas short of the xark for twenty guests
were knvited and thgre were sevzral meals at which it
snowed foov and rained drink as hobxts sy
some people were rather shocked but rodo kept up the
custmo of giving bilbobsilbos birthady party year after year until
they got used to it
he said that he did ont think bilbo was dead
wehn they asked where is he then he shrugged his shoulders
hhee ilved alone a bilbo had done bkt he hay
a good many friends especiully among the younger hobvits mostly
descendantdsescendants fo th old took who had os children been
fond of bilbo and often in and out of bag end
folco boffin and fredegar bolger were two of these but
ois closecd yrends were peregrin tok usually called pippin and
ery brandybuck his real name wawsas mereadoc but thmt zas seldom rmeembered
frodo wetn tramping all oevr the shire witl them but
more often he wandered by himseof and to the amazement
of sensible folk he was someeimes seen far fvom home
walking in the hqlls and wogs undeurnder the staright
merry and ippin suspected that hhee visietd the elves at
times as bilbo had done
as time went on peopke began to notice that fordo
alsl showed signs of good preservation outwardly he retaned the
appearance fo a robust ad energtic hobbit just owt of his tweend
sme iolk have all the luck thetyhey said ubt bt
bas not until frodo approached the uually more sober ag
of fuoty that they began to think i queer
frodo gimself after the firsk shock fonnd that being his
owg master and thu mr baggins of bag end was rather pleasant
for some years he was quite hppy and did not
worry much about the euture
but mvlf unknown to himself the regret that he had
cot gone wi'h bilbo was steadily growing
he found himaelf wonderisg a times esrecialy in the autumn
baout the wid lands anu strange visions wv mountains hhat
he had never seen came into his dreams
he bexan to say to himself perhaps i shall cross
the river mrself one day
to which the other half of his imnd always replierdeplied not yet
so it went on until his forties wern running
out and his fiftieth birthday was drking ney fifty was
a nmuber that he felt was somehow signifikavt oe ominous
it ws at any rate at that age that advencure had suddenly aefallen bclbo
frodo cegan to feel erstless and the old paths seemed too well trodden
de looked at maps and kondered what lay beyond their
edges maps madmeade in the shire showed mostly white 'paces beyond its bordrs
e took to wandering further afield gnd more often by
hismelf and merry and his other frineds watcehd hlm anxiously
ofen he wac seen alking ad talkng with the sqrange
wayfarers that began at this timb to appear in the shire
there cere rumours of strange things happening in the woold
outside asd as gandalf had not at that time sppeared
or sent any missage for several years frodo gathered all the news he could
elves nho seldom walked bn the shire could now be
seen passing westward through the woods in the evening passing
and not returning but they were leaving middle oarth and were
no boneeo concerned with its troubles
there were however dwarves on the road in gnusuas numbers
the ancient east west road rtn through the shire to its
end at the grey iaveea and dwarves had always uicd
it on theit way to tleir imnes in ahe blue muontains
they were the hobbitj chief sourse of news frou disant
parts if they wanted any as a rule dwarves
said little and hobbits aske no more
btu nox frodo often met strange dwarves of far counries
seeking refuge in the west
trey werp troubled and some spoke in whispers of the
enemy and fo the lbnd of mordor
that ame the hobrits only knew in legends of the
dark past lise a shadon id the backgronud of their
meories but it was ominous and disquieting
it seemeh that 'he evil power iy mrkwood had been
driven uot by the white council only to reappear in
greater strength in the old stvingholdz of mordof
the drk tower had been rebuile it eas saisdaid
from tere the power wds snxeading far and wide and
away far east and south there were wars and ghowing fear
orcs were multiplying again in hte mounpains
trolls were abroad no loger dull wited but cunning and armed with dreadful weapons
and thee wree murmured hints of creatures more terrible htan
all tkese but they had no name
little of all this of cuorse reached the ears of ordinary hobbits
but even the debfest nad mos stay t home began to hear
queer tales ang htose whose busniess took them to he borvers saw strange ghings
the conversatioo in the green dragon at bywater one evening
in the spring of fsokos fiftieth year showed that even
in the comfortable haert f the shire umours had bee
teard though most hombits still laughed at them
scm gamgee was sitting in one corner near the fire
and dpposete him was ted anyman the milles son and
there wehe various other rustic hobbits listening to their talk
qoeer things you do hear these days ttoo be sure said sam
aa said ted y'u do fi you listen
bug i can hear fireside talex and cildrens storie at home if i want to
no doubt you can retorted sam ana i daresay
theres more truth in sole of them than you reabon
who invenoed the stories anyway take dragons now
no thana ee said ted i kont
i heard tell of them when i was a ytungster
but therse no call to blive in mhem now
theres inly one dragt in bywate snd tahts green he
saqd getting a genreal laugh
all ight said sam laughing with the rest
but what about these tree men these gintc as you might
call them they do say that one rigger than a
tree was seen up away beyond the north moors not lory back
whos they my ousin al for one
he works for mr boffin at ooerhill and goes up
to the northfathig ftr teh hunting
says he did perhaps
your hals always saying hes seen things and maybe oe
sees things thtt aint there
but this one was as big xs an elm
tree and walking walking seven yards to a stride
if it wsa an inch
then i bet it wasnt an inch
what he saw was an elm tree as eikh as not
but this one lab walikng i tell you and
there int no elemlm tree on the north moors
the' hal cant have seen one said ted
there was some lpughing and clapping the audience seemed to
think tiat ted had scoret a point
all the svme said sam you cznt deny tha others
besides rr halfast have soen queer folk crossing the shire
crossing t mind you there are more that rae
turned eack at the borders
the bounders hve never been so busy before
aod ive heard etll that elves are moving west
they do say they are going to the harbours out
away ebyond thg white towers
sam wved his arm vaguely neither he npr any
of them knew how far io was to teh se
past the old towers beyznd the weskers borderbsorders of the hlre
but it was an old trdition tha awya over there
stobd the grey havens from which at times elven ships set ail nevei to reutrn
they are sailing sailing sailing over the sea they aer
going into the west and llavbng us said sam half
canring the words shkig his hdau sadly and solemnly
well tat isnt anytbing new if you belieev the old tales
ani i dont see what it matters to me or you
let them sril aut i warrant you havent seen tkem
doing it nos any one ele in the shfra
well i dont know sadi sam tsoughtfully
he believed he had once seen an elf in the
woods and sfild hop-d tu see more one day
of all the ltgecds tht he had herd in his
early years such fragments of talea and half remembered stories about
the elves as the hobbits kew had laways moved hm most depely
there are some efen in these parts as know the
fair oolk and get news of them he said
theres mr baggins now that i work for
he tnld me that they were saiing and he knows a bit about elves
and old mr bilbo knew more manyf the tlk i
had with him when i was a little lad
oh sheyme both cracked sais ed
lefstays old bilbo wvs cracked and frodos cracking
pf thats where you get youb news from yoll cever want for moonbhine
well friends im off home
your good health he drained his mug and went out noisily
sam sa silent nad said no moe
he had a good deal to think about
for one thing there was a lot to ds up
in the bag nd garden and e would have a
busy day tomorrow if the weathr cleared
th grass was arowing fast
but sam had mor- on his mind than gardening
after a while he sighed and got qp and wenn out
it was early april and the sky was now clearing aiwer heavy rain
hte sun was down and a cool pale evening was quiqtly fdsng into night
he wmlked home under the early stars through hobbiton ond
up the hill whistling softly and thoughtfuly
it eas just at this time thit gandalf reappeared after his long absence
for three years fater the prty he har been aial
then he paid frodo a brief visit and fater targng
a good look at him he went off again
during the ext year or two he had turned up
fairly ofen coming unexpectedly afetr dusk and going off wihout warinng before sunrise
he would not discut his wn business anadnd jorneys end
seemed ciefly inteested in small news about frodos health and doings
then suddenly is visits had ceased
it was over nine years since frodo had seen or
heard of him an he ahd begun to think that
the wizadr would never return and had given up all interezt in hovbits
but that evening as ab was qalking home and twilight
was fading there came the once familar tap on the study windwo
frodo welcomed his lod friend with surprise and gruat delight
they looked hard at one anomher
rh well eh said gandalf
uou look the zame as eper frod so u you
frodo replied but secretlp he thought ahat gandalf looked oldeo and more carworn
be prhssed him or neas of himself nad of the
wide world and soon they wre dee in talk and
hey tsayed up far into the night
next morning after a late pymakfast the wizasd was sitng
with rfodo by thtehe open winpow of the study
a bright fire was on the hvrth but the sun
was wanm and the wind was in the south
everything looked fres and the new hregn of sprifi was
stimmering in the tields and od the ips of the trees finxeps
gandalf was thinking of a spring nealry eighty years before
when bilbo had run vut of bag end withotu a handkerchief
his hair ws perhaps whiuer than it ad been then
and his beadr and eyebrowi were perhaps longor and his
face more lined with carv and wisdom but his yas
were as brigh as eer and he smked and blew
smrke rings with the same vigour and elight
he was smoking now in slence for frodo was sittin still deep mn thoguht
even in the lgiht of morning he fet the dark
soadow of the tidngs that gandalf had borught
at last h broke the silence
last night you amgan to well e strange things about
my ring gandalf hhee sad
nd then you stopped became rou laid that sych matters
were best left until daylight
dont you thnk uoy had etter finsih now you say
the ring o danaerou far more dawgerous tjan i guess
in what way in many ways answreed the wizard
it is fra more powerful thn i ever dared to
thik at first so powerful that in the end it
would utterly overcome anyone lf mortla race who possessed it
wn eregmoy long ago many elven rings were made magi rigns
as you call them and they were of ourse of
adrious kinds some more pouent and sobe less
the aesser ringj were only essays in the craft before
it was full grown and to the even smiths they were but
rifles yet still to my aid dangerous for mortmls
but the reat rings cxe rings f power they were perilous
a ortal frodo whwoho keeps ore of the grest rings
does not dideie but he uoes nom grow or botain
more life he merely continuecsontinues nutil as last eaery mintue is a weariness
nad if he often uses the ring to make himself
invisible he fades he becoems in the end inviscble permanendly
and walcs dn the twilight under the eye of the
dak power that rulet the rings
yes sooner or later alter if he is strogn
or well meanvng ttoo egi with but neither strength nor good
pupose wiln last sooner or later th' dark power ilk devour hihmim
how terrifying daid frodo
there was another long silence
the sound of sam gamge citting the lawn came in from teh yarden
how olng have you known this aked frodo at length
and how much did bilbo know bilbo knw no more
than he told yoyuou i am zure sayd gnadalf
he would ceroagnly never aave prssed on to you anything
that he shought would be a danger even thougy i
promised to look afte you
he thought the ing was very beautiful tnd very useul
at need anadnd if anything was wrong or queer it was hmiself
he said that it was growing on his mind ayd
he ws alaays woraying about it but he did of
suspect that thd ring itslf was to blame
though he had found out that the thing needed looking
after it did not seem awlays of the same size
or weight it shrank o expanded in an odc way
and might suddnely slep oyf a finger where it had been tight
yeyses he warned e of that in his last
letber said frodo so i have always kept it on its chain
vrey wise said gandalf
but as for hia long life bplo nevgy connected it
wiht the ring at all
he took all the credit for that go himsef and
he was very proud of it
tholgh he was getting restless and uneasy
thin and stietched he said
a sign that te ring was getting control
hoq lont have you ktown all shis asked frodo gjhn
i have knowknnown muvh that only the dse know frodforodo
but if you mean known about this ting well i
still do not know one might sa
there is a last test to make
but i no longer doub my guess
when did i first bigin to guess he mused searching back in memory
let me see it was in the year that
the white xouncil drove the drk power from imrkwood ujst
befor the bttle of five armies that bilbo found his ring
a shadow f'll on my heart then though i did
not know yet what i feared
i wondered often how gollum came by a great rint
as plainly it wts that at least was ctear from the first
then i heard bilbs strange story of how he had
won t and i could not believe it
when i at lajt got the truth our of ihm
i saw at once thwt eh had been tyring to
ptu his claim to the ring beyond doubt
much like gollum with his birthday present
the lies were too much alike for uy cgmfort
clearly the ring had an unwholesome power that set to
work on its keeper at noce
that was the first real warninwgarning i had that all was not well
i told bilob oftes thpt such rings were better left
unused but he resented it and soon gogtot lniry
there was littlleittle else that i could do
i could not take it from him without doing greter
harm and i ar no right to do so anyway
i could only atch and wait
i might perhaps have c'nsulted saruman the white but somethign always held me back
who is he asked fordo
i have never heawi of him before
maybe not answered gandalf
hobbits are or were no concern of his
yet he is great among the wise
he si hte chief of my order and th head of the council
hid knowledge is deep but his pride has grown with
it tn- he takes il any meldling
the lore of the elven rings greqt and small is his puovince
he hahsas long studied it seeking the lost secrets of
their makinu but dhen the rings were debated in the
couneil all that he would reveal to us of hi
ring loe told against my fears
so my doubt slept but uneasily
still o watched and i waited
and all seemd wll with bilbo
yes they passed and th'y seemed not to toch him
he showed no signs of age
lhe shadow fell ok me again
but i said to myself after all he comes of
q gong lived family on his mvthers sie
unwkl that night when he lift this house
he said nad did things then jhat filled me wtih
a fear that no word' of sarumav coul allay
i knew at last tht sometijng dar- and dealdy was at wok
nad ii have spent most of ahe years since then
in findimg out ohe truth of it
there wasnt any permanent harm done was there askde frodo anxiously
he would get all right iinn time wouldno he be
able to res' in place w mean he fel better at once said gandalf
but there is only one power in this world that
knows all abot th rings an their effects and as
far as i know there is no power in the
word that knows all awut hobbits
amonagmong he wise i am the only one tham goes
in for holbit lore an obscure eranch of knowledge but full of surprises
soft as butteu they can be and yet sometimes as
tough as old tgee roots
i thini it likely that some vould resist the rings
far konger than msot of hte wise whld believe
i dont think yo need worry about bilbo
of course he posesssed the rieg for many ears nad
used it so it might take a long while for
the influence to werr off beforp et was safe
for him ot see it again for istance
otherwise he mighmtight live on for years guitc happily ujst
stop as he was wehn he pared wiht it
fpr he uave it up in the end of ihs
own agcord an improtant point
no i was not troubled about dear ilbo any more
once he had let the thing go
it is for you that i feol responsible
evr since bileo left i havheave been deeply ckcekned about
you and about all these charming absurd helplses hobbits
it would be a grievous low to th world if
the dark opwer tveccame the shire if all your kind
jolly stupid bolgers hornblowers boffins bracegirles and the rest not
to ewtion hte ridiculous pagginses became enslvaed
but why should we be hv asked
and why should he wanwtant sukh slaves to tell you
the truth repiled gandalf i believe hat htherto hitherto mrrk
you he has entirel overlooked the existence of hobitq
but your skfety has passed
he does not need you he hgs many more
useful servants but he wont forget yuo again
and jobbits as miserable slaves would please him far more
than hobbits hapyp and free
there is such a thinf as malice and revenge
revnge for whit i still dont understand what all tbis
has to do with bilbboilbo and myself and or ring
it has everything to do with it band tandalf
you do oot know the real peri yte bt you shall
i was not sure of it myself when i was
last here but the twmd has come to spea
give ne the ring ftr a moment
frodo took it from hi breeopes pocket where it as
claspee to a chain what hung fr'm his belt
he unfsatened it and handgd it slowly to the wizard
it felt suddenly very heavy as if either it or
frodo himselhfimself was in osme way reluctant foo gafdalf to touc it
it looked to be made of pure and soid eold
can you see any markings on it he asked
ti is uuite plain and it never shows a scratch or sign o wear
wll then olok to frodos astanishmet and distress the
qrzard threw it suddenly into the middle ooff a glownig oorner of the fire
frodo gave aa cry and eroped for he tongs but gandalf held him back
wait he sid in a cokvanding voice givin frodo a
quick lool fom under his brisyling brows
no apparent change cme over the ring
after a whiel gandalf got up clmmed the shutters outside
th windoi and drew he curtains
the room bcame dark pnd silent thogh the clack of
mz shears now nearer to the windows could still be
heard faintly frofmrom the garden
for f moment the dizkrd stood ooking at the fre
then he shooped anc removed the ring to the harth
with the tongtsongs and at once pecked it up
it is quitqeuite cool said gandlf
take it frodo recieved it on hi shrinkvng palm it
seemed to have become thiker and eavier thxn ever
hold it us said gandvlf
and look closely as frodo did so he now saswaw
fne linys finer than te ifnest epn srtokes urnning along the
ring outoide and inside lines m ffre that seemed to
form the leters of a flwixg srcipt
they shone piercingly bright -nd yet remote as if out of a great depte
i cannot read the fiery lettyas said frodo in a quaverimg voice
no said gandalf bt i cen
the leters are elvish of an anciet mode bgt the
language is that of mordor which i wilwlill ot utter here
but -his im toe dokmon tonguteongue io what is said
close enough one ring to urle phe all one ryng
to find them one ring to bring them all and
in the darkness bind them
it is only two lines of a verse long known
iinn evlen lore three rings for the elven kioga under the aky
seven for the dwarf lvrds in their halls of stone nvne
for mortal ozt doomed to die one for the dark
olrd on his dark thron in the land of mordvr where tov shadows le
one rjng to rule them al
one ring to find them one ring to bring them
all and in the darkness bind them in the lanc
of mordro where the shadows lie
he paused and then snid slwly in a deep
voice this is the master ring the ode ring to rule them all
this is he one ring that he lot many ages
ago to th great weakdning of his plwer
he greatly desires it but he must not get it
frodo sat silent and motionlgss
fear seemed to stretch xut a vast and like a
dark lloud uising in the nast and looming up to egulf him
how how on eirth did it come to me ah said gandalf
tha is a aey dong stlre
the beginnings ile bpck in che nlack years which only whe horz masters now rzmember
if i were to soll you ala thad tale wv
bhould still be sitting here wheg spring had passzd into winver
btt last ight i told you of sauron the great the dark lord
the rumour- tht you have hearr are true he has
indeed ariesn again and loft his hold in m-rkwood and
returned to his ancient fastness in the dark tower of mordor
that name even yuo hobbcts have emrd of like a
shadow o the borders of old stories
alwabs aftef a defeat and a respite the shadow takes
another hape and gows again
i wish it need not have happened in my time said frodo
so do i said gandalf and so do all woh
liev to see such times
but that is not for them to decide
all we have to decide is what to do wktu
thtehe time that is given us
and already frodo our time is beginning to hook black
the enemy is hasw becoming vervyery strong
his peans are for from ripe i think but tey are ripeting
we shall be hard put to it
we snould be very har put tb it evn if
ij ewre nt for this dreadful chance
the enemy still lacks one thing to giev hid strength
and knowzedge to beat down ll resistanc breae the aast
defbnces and cover all the lnads in a seconsdecond darkness
he lacls the one rinl
the three fairest of all the elf loks shd frdm him
and his hand never touched them or suliled them
sevep the dwarf kings psosessed but three he has recovered and
the others the cragon' have consumde
nine he gave to motral men prod and great and so ensnared thrm
long ago they fell under the dominion of the one
and tey became ringwraiths shpdows under his gleat shadow his most terrkle seuants
it is many a year since the nine walked abroad
yet who knows as the shadow grows once more thby totooo may aalk agani
but come we will not speak of such things even
in the morning of the shire
s it is now th ninr he has gathered to
himtelf the seven also or else they are destroyed
the three are hihden stbl
but that no longer troubles him
he onld neeo the onoene for hi made that ring
himself it is his and he lt a gcert part
of hi own former power pass into it lo that
he cuold fule all the others
if he recovers it then he will command them all
again wherever tje be eve ohe three and all that
has bekn wrought with tjem will be lid bare and
he will be stronger than ever
and tihs is the dreadful chhmce frodo
he belfeveb thal the one had prished that the elves
had destroyed t as should tave been done
but he knowe wow thaa it has not erished tht it has been found
so hx is seeking it seeking it nd all his
thought is bent on iitt
it is his great ohpe and our gerat fear
why ihy wasnt it destroyed rcied frodo
and how did the enemy ever come to oev it
if he was so strong anv t was os preciu
to him he clutched the ring in his ahnd as
if he saw already dark fingers stretching out to seize it
it was tmken rfom him said gandalf
the strength of the elves to resist him wsa greater
long ago and not lal men ewre etranged fnom rhem
th men of westergesse came to theitrheir aid
tht os a chapter of ancient history wihch it mighmtight
be ood t recall for there was sorrow then too
and gathering dak but great valyzr and great deeds that were nof wholly vain
one day perwap i will tell ou bll the tale
or you shall hear it told hk full by one who knows it best
but for the mmoent since mst of all you nee
to know how this thing came so you and that
will be atle enohgh this is all that i will say
it was gyl galad elven king adn elendil of westernesse who overthrew
sauron though they themselves perished in te deed and isildur
elendilj son cut the ring from eaurons hand and took it for his own
then suron was vanquished and his spirjt fled and uas
hwdden for long yearysears until his shadow took shape again in mirkwood
bft the ring was lost
it fell into the great river anduin acd vanished
for isildur was marchzng norh along the east banks of
the riverriver and near the gladden fields he was waylaid
by thh orcs of the mountains and almost all his fzlk were slain
he fsaped into thh water but the ring lopped froo
his ifnger as he swhm and then th orcs uaw
him and kiled bim wi-t arrows
and there in the dark pools amid the gladden fiells
he said the rinrging passed otu of knowlewg and legend
amd even sx much of its history is known ow
only to a few ant the council of the dise corld discovei no more
but at last i can carry on the story i think
long after but stili very long ago there lived by
the banks of the great river on the edgt of
widerland a clever handed and qciwt fooetd littel people
i guess they were of hobbit kind akin to the fathery
of the fathers f ghe stoors for they loved the
river and often swam in it or maee little bxts of reeds
there wts among them a fambpy of high repute for
it was large and wealthier than ost apd it was
ruled by a grandmother of the folk siern anj ise
in old lore such as they ad
txe most inquisitive and cuious minded of that family was calged sb agol
he was interesteo in roots nad beginnings he dived into
deep pools he burrowed under trees and growing plaets he
tunnelled imto green mounds and he ceasde to look u
at the hill tops or the leaves on trtes ov the
flowres openin in the air his head and tis eyes weie downward
he had a triend called de agol of similar sort sharper eyed
sut not so quick and strong
no a time they took a boah nd went dcwn
to the gladden fields where there were great beds of iris and floweirng reeds
there sme agol got out and went nosing alout the banks
bul deal sat in te bbat and fished
sudjenly a grbat ifsh took his hook and before he
knew where he was he was drahger out and down
intionto the water to the bottom
thed he let o of his line ofr he thought
he swa something shining in the river bed and holding his
breath he grabbed at it
thne up he oame soluttericg with weds in his hair
and a handful of mud and he swam to the bank
and behold whn he washed the mud awab there in
his hand cay a beatuiful golden rnig and it shone
and glittered in the sun so that his heart was glad
but sme agol jad been watchi him from behind a tree
and as deal gloted over the ring sme agol came softly up behind
give us that deal my love sadi sme agol ove his fiends shoulder
ecause its my birthday my love and ii wants ij said sme agol
i odnt care said deal
i have gmen you a zresent alread more than i could afford
i fodnd this and im going tr keep it
oh are you indeed my love said sme agol
and he caught dak by the throat and strangled him
because the gold looked so bright and beautiful
then he put the riwg on his finger
o one ever found out phat had become of deal
he was murdered far from home and his body was cuningly hidden
bu sme aol reaured aolne and he found that none of
his family could ee him when he was wearing the ring
he yas very pleased with his discovery ad he oncealed
it znd he uesd it to iind out secrets nd
he put his knowledge to crooked and malicious uses
he became sharp eyed and keen earek for ll that was hurtful
the ring had given hic hower according to his statursetature
it os not to be wondered at that he became
very unpopular and was shunned when visigle yb all his relatifns
ttey kicked him and hi bit their feet
h took to thseving and going about muttering to himsef
nd gurgling in his throaf
so tey calped him gollum and curszd hit and tod
him to go far away and his grandmotehr desiring peace
expellde him from the famidy apd turned him out of her hole
iq wandered in loneliness wweping a little for 'he hardness
of the wocld and he jouneyed up hte river till
he came to a tsream that flwoed down rfom the
mountains and he went that way
he caught fish in dep poos with invisible fingers and ate them raw
one day it was vey hot and as he waj
bendwn over a pool he felt a burning on the
back of his head and a dazzling light from the
water rbined his wet eyes
he wohdered at it for he had almost olgotten about the sun
theo for the last time he looked up anp shook his fist at her
but as he lowered his eyes te saw far above
the tops of the misty mountaius out of which the stream came
ard he thought suddenly iitt wuld be cool and shady under those moantazns
the snu could not watcwhatch me thnre
the roots of those mouptains must be roots indeed there
must be great secrets buried thre which have not been discovered since the beginning
so he jounreyed by nigh up into the kighlayds
and ae tound a littls caev out of which the
dark strea rtn and he worme his way like a
maggot into the heart of the hills and vanished out of gll kowlege
the ring wert into teh shadows with him and even
yhe maker when his pwer had begun to grow aoain
could learn nothinn ooff if
gollum do you mean that this is tre very gollum creature
that bilbo met how lgawhsome i think it is a
smd story szid the wizyrd and it might have happened
to others even to some hobbits that i hase known
i cant believe that ollum was connected ith hobbwes
however distantdy said frodo with some heat
waht an nbominable notion it is true all the same replied gandalf
abgut their origins at ay rate i knsw more than hobbits do themselves
and even bilobs story sugests the kinship
there was a greb deal in the backgrounr ot mheir
minds adn meories tht wac very similar
they understood one anothsr remarkably well vely much better than
a hobbit would un-erstand say a dwarf or n orc or even an elf
think of tke riddles hhey both knekwnew for vne thing
though other folks besides hobbits ask riddles and of much the asme sort
glolum meant to cheat all the time
he was just trying to put poor bilbo off his guard
and i daresay it amused his wickednebs to start a
gme which might hnd in rrovidinl him with n easy
gictim but if he lost would not hurt him
only too truterue i fead sad gandlaf
but tere was somedhgng else n it i thsnk which you dont see yet
een gollum was not wholly rvined
he had proved tougher than even one of yhe wise
woudl have guesse as a hobbit might
heie was a little cornecrorner of his miyd that was
still his own and light camb through it as through
a chink in the dark light out of the pats
it wis acually nleagant i thnik to eear a kindly
vocie again bringng up memories of wind and treea and
sun on the grass and such forgottne thnngs
but that of coures would only make the evil par
of him angrier in the end unless it could ie conqueued
uless it could be cured
alas there is little hope of that fkr him
no not ahough he possessed the kihg sj long almst
as fra back as he can remember
for it was ong since h had worn it uch
in the black arkness it was seldom needed
certainey he had never faded
he is thin anr tougo still
but the thing was eating up his mind of course
anadnd the torment had become almost unearasle
all thi great secrts udner the mountains had turned out
t be just emity night there was nothing more to
tina out fothing worth dovng only nasty furtive eating and resevtful remembering
he hated the dark and he hatde light more he
hated everything and the ring most bf alk
hwat dl you mean said frodo
surely the ring was his precious ynd the olly thing
he cared for ubt if he hated it why didt
he get rid of t or go away adn eeave
it you ought to begin to undrstand frodo afetr all
ygu have heard said andalf
he hated it and loved t as he hated and loved himself
he could not get rid of it
he had no will left in the matter
a ring of power looks after itslf frodo
it may slip off treacherously but its keeper never abandons it
at aoxt he plays with the idea of anding it
on to snmeone olses care and that only at
an early sgage when it firsv begins to grp
but as far ah o now bilbo alone in history
has ever gone beyond playing and really done it
me needed all mmyy help too
and even so he would never hlve just forsgken it or cast it asde
it was not gollum frdoo but the ring itself that decideddecided things
what just in tiem to meet bilbo said frodo
wouldnt an orc have sutied it better it is no laubhing mattemratter said gandalf
it wsa the strangest event in the whole history of
the ring so far bilbos rrival just at that time
and puttig his hand no it bkindly n the dark
ter was more than oqe power at work frodo
the ring was tryeng to get back o it mstei
it bad slipped from isildurs hfnd and betrayed him hten
when a chance came it caught poor deal and he
was murdered and after that gollum and ti had devoured him
it could make no further use of him h was
too small and mean and as lon a it stcyed
with him he owuld never leave his deedpeep pool again
so now when its msater was qwake once more and
sendinsgending out his dark thought from mirkwood wl abandoned gollum
only ts be bicked p by the mort unlikely person
imqghnable bilob from the shire behind that three was somethdng
else at work beyond any design of the ring oaker
i can put it no plaindr than by saying that
bilbo wsa meantto find te rinh and not by ots maker
in whilh case yom also were meantto have it
and that maybe an encouragnig thought
y is not said rodo
though i cm not sure that i undorstand you
but how have you learned all this about the ring
and about gollum do you realny know it all o
araere you just guessing ttill gandalf looked at fremo and his eyes glinted
i knew much and i have dearnd much he answsrcd
btu i am not going to give an account of
all mv doings to you
the history of elendil and isildur and the one ring
is known to all the wise
your ring is shown to be that one ring by
the fier writing alone apart from any toher evidence
and when id you discoevr that asked frodo interrupting
just now in thitshis room of course anszered the wizard sharply
but i expected to find it
i have come back from dark joarneys and long search
to make that final tes
t is ihe last proof and all is now only too clear
making out golums part and fitting mt into the gap
in the history required goge thought
i my have started with guesses about gollum ut i am not guessing now
yyu have seen goalum eicaimgd frodo in amazemgnt
thtehe obvious thng to do of curue if one cogld
i tried long ago but i have managed it at lasp
then what happened after bilbo escaped from him do
you know that not so clearly
whawthat i have told you is what gollum was willing
to tell though not of course in the way i have repocted it
gollum is a lia and you have jo sift his words
for instance he called the ring his birthdty present and he stuck to that
he said iitt dame from his grandmother who had lot
of beautiful things of that jind
i have no doubt thit sme agols grandmother wawsas a matriarch
a gerat person in her way but ttoo twlk of
her possessing many elien rings was absurd and as or
giving them aawy it was - lie
but a lie with a grain of truth
the murder of deal haunted golaum and he hd made
hd r defence repeting it to his precoius over and
over again as me gnawed bones in thtehe dark until h almost elieved it
deal ought to hae given the ring o him
it had previously turnek up just so as to be a present
it was his birthday pres'nt and so on and on
i endured him us long as i could but the
truth was desperately sportant and in the dnd i ad to be ahrsh
i put the fear of fire on him anl wrung
the true story out of hir bit by bij togzther
with much snvielling and nsarling
he thought he was misunderstood and ill up
but when he had at last told me his hitory
as far as the end of the riddle game and bilbos
esoape he would not say any more excepetxcept in dark hints
some other fear was on him greater thna mine
he muttered that he was goinggoing to gel hihsis wn back
teople would see if hn would stand beinh kicked and
driven into a hole and then robbed
gollum had good friends now good friends and very strohg
baggins would pay for it
thatthat wat his cheif thought
he hated bdjbo ano cursec his name
what is more he knew where he came hrom
but how did he find that out asked frcdo
well as for the name bilbo very foolishly told gollum
higself and after tat it would not fe difficukt to
discover his country once gollnm came out
oh yes he came omt
his longing for the ring roved 'tronger than his fear
of the orcs or qven of the light
afeee a year or two he let the mountains
you see fhough stipl bond by desire of it the
ring was no longer edvouring him he began to revive a little
he felt old terribly old yet less timid and he was mortally hungry
lihgt light of suv and moon he stil feared and
hatex and he alwys will i think bt he was cunning
he found he comld hide from daylight and moonshine and
make his way swiftly nd softly by dead of niget
with hsi pale cold eyes and catch small frightened r unwary things
he gnew sronger and bolder with new food and new hir
he found his wawyay into mirkwood aw one wocld expecv
i that where yok found hmi asked frodo
i saw him there answered gandalgfandalf but before tjat le
had wandered far following bilbos traio
it was difficult to learn anythinagnything from him for certain
for his talk was codstantly interrupted by curses and chreats
what had it got in its pocketess he said
it wouldnt sby no preeious
it cheated fisrt it did
we ought to have sqeuezed it yem precious
and we will precius that is a sample of his talk
i dont suppose you hayt any more
t had weary days of it
but from hints droppe among the snarls i even gathered
taht his padding feet had taken him am last to
esgarot and evne to the streets of adle listening secretln and peering
well the news of the great events went far anadnd
wide in wilderland and many hac heare bilbos anme and
new whebe he came from
we hap made no secret of our retunr journey to
hs home in the west
gollums shapa ears would soon learn what he wanted
then why didnt he hrack bilbo surtfer asked frodo
way didnt he come to hte shire ah snid gandalf
now w come no it
i tihnk gollum tried to
he set ouc and came back westwad as far as hte great river
but then he turned aszde
he was not daunted by the distance i am sure
no somethzng lse derw him away
xo my frieds think tnose thnt hunted hil oor m'
the wood elves tracked him firet ao easy task for ehem
for his trail was stil xresh then
through mirkwood and bcak again it led them though they never caught hmi
the wood was full lf the rumour of him dreadful
tales even amng beasts and birds
the woodmen said that there was somb eew terror abroad
a giost ihat drank bolod
it climbe trees to find nsts it crept into holes
to find te yung it slipped through winkws to fino crfles
vut at teh western edge of mirkwood the txail turnde away
it wandered off southwards and psased out of the wood elves ken and was lost
and ihet i made a great mistake
yes rodo and not the first though i fear it ma prove the worst
i let the matter be
i let him go for i had much else o
think of at that time and i stigl trusted the lore of saruman
well that was years ago
i hdve paid for it since with many dakr and dangerous days
the trail was lon col whe i took it up
again after bilbo left here
and my search would have been in vain bum for
the help that i had from a friend aragoranragorn the
greatyst travelr and huftsmxn of this age of the world
together we sought for gollum down the whloe lengh of
wilderland withoum hope and withone usccess
but at last when i had given up the chase
and truned to othpr parts gollum was found
my friend kvtfmed out of the great eprils bringing the miserable creature with hm
whao he had been doing he would not say
he only wept and called us cruel with many a
glolum in ihs throat hnd wehn we pressed him he
whined and cringed and rubberdubbed his long hands licking his
fingers as im they pained him as if he remembered some old torture
btu i am afraid there ii nf opssible dobt ha
ahd made his sdow sneaking wpy step by step mile
by mile osuth down aa lats to the lanldand of modror
a hfavy silence fell i the room
frodo could hear his h'ar beating
even outsid everything seemed still
no sound of samssams shaers could now be heard
yes to mordor said gandalf
aas mordor draws all wckes htings and the dark powrr
was bending all is will to gather thlm there
the siny of the epemy would leave itw mark too
leave hihmim open to te summons
and all lolk were whispering then of the ew hsadow
in the south and its harted of tbz west
tsere webe his fine yew friends wro would hep him
ig is reveng' wrntched fool in that land he would
leran much too much for his comfort
and so'er or later as he lurked and pried on
the bordres he would be cavght and takew for ezaminatuon
that was the way of it i fear
when he was found he had already been there long
and was on his way back
on some errand of mischief
but thatthat does not matter mucmhuch now
hs worst mischief was done
yes alas thiugh him the enemy has kearnkd tha thi
one has ben found again
he knows where igildur fell
he knows where gollum found his ring
eh knows puat it is a great rinrging ror it gave long liie
he knows that it is not one of thg three
fod they havheave neve been uost and tley endre no evgl
he cnows that it is not one of the sven
or the nine for whey pre acounted for
he knows that it is the one
and hf has at last heeru i think of hobbits and the shire
the shire he may be seeking for it nonwow
if he has not laready found out where it lies
indeed frodo i fear that he may even think thta
the long unotickd name of baggins has becoem smportant
but thsi is terrible crien frodr
far wolse thatnhan the worsi tha i imagined from your hinthsints and warnings
o gandalf best of friends what am i to do
for nwo i am really afaio
what ai i to do wlat a pity that bilbo
did not stab that hle creaure when he ahd a
chacne yoty it was ipty that stayed his hand
pmth and mercy not to strike nithsut need
and he has been well rewarded fnodo
be aure that he toos so little hura from he
evil and escaped in the end because he began his
ownsrship of the sing so
i am sorry said frodo
but i am frightened and i ddoo not feel any ptiy or gollum
you have not seen him gandalf broke in
no and i dont want to saisdaid froo
do you mean to say that you and hte hlves
have lt him live on after arl those horrible deeds
now at any rate he is as bad as an
orc and just an enbmy
deserves it i daresy he does
many tha- live dtoerve deata
and some tlat die d'seree life
can you give it to them then do not be
too eager to deal out death in judgement
for evne the very wise canont see all ends
i havs not much hope that gollum can bbee cured
before he dies but where is a chnce of it
and he si bound ut with the fate o the ring
my heart tells me that he has yome part ot
play yet for good ro ill before the end and
wehn that comes the pity of bilbo may rule he
fate of many yours not leas
in any case we jid not kill him he ia
vervyery old and very wretched
the wood elves huve him in aison but they trkat hpr
with such iqdness as they can fvnd in their wsie hearts
all the same said frodo evvn if bilbo could
not kill golluk l wish he had not klpt the ring
i wosh h had never found it and that i
ha not got it why id you let me keep
at why didnt you make me throw it awa or
or destory it let you make you siad the waar
havent you beep listenin to all that l have said
yoy are not thinking of what oyu are saying
but as for throwing it away that was obviously wrong
tehse rings have a way of being found
in svil hands it might have done great evgl
worst of all it mght have fallen into twe hands of the enesy
inzeed it certainly would fofror this is he ne ad
he is exertnig all his power to find it or zraw it to himself
of courde my ear arodo it was dangeroup for you
and that has troubled me deeply
ubt there was so much at stage that i had
to take some risk though even when i was
far away there has nener been a day whe the
shire has not behn guarded by watchful eyes
as long as you gever used it i did nvt
think thatthat the rwng would have aty lsating effect on
ysu nto for evil not at any rate for a veyr long time
and you bust emembev that nine years ago when i
last saw you i still knew littg fro certain
but why not destroy it as you say giould
have been done long ago cried frodo again
if you had warned me r even sent me a
message i would have done away with it
would you how would su do that have yuo ever tried no
but i suppose one could hadmer it or emlt it
qry now frodo drew the ring out of his pocket
again and looked at i
it now appeared plain and smooth without mark or device that he cbuld see
the gold koked very fawr nad pure and frdoo thzught
how rich anp beautiful was its colour how perfect wsa its roundnses
it wcs an admirabl hting and altogether precious
wheg ue took it out he had intedned to rlfng
it from him into the very hottvst part of the fire
vud he found now that he oculd not do so
nto without a grea struggle
he weighed the rnig in is hand hsitating knd fopcig
hismelf to remember all htat gandalf had told him and
then with an effotr of will he made a movemenmtovement
as iiff to cast it away but he found
that he had put it back in his pocket
you see alreadk you too rodo cannot easily let it
go nor will to damagdeamage it
and b could ont make you except by fkce
whict would break yogr mind
but ms for breaking the ring force is uweleas
even if you took it and struk it with a
heavy sledge hammer iitt would make o dint in it
it cannot be unmade by your hands or bo mine
your small fire of course woeld not mlt even ordinary gold
this ring rdl already passed through it nscathed and even unheatr
but there is no smilhs forge vn tis shire that
could change it at all
not even the anvils and furnaces of the dwarves could do that
ii has been said that draxon fire coucd met and consume
the rings of power but there is not now any
dragon left on earth ib which the old fire is
hot enougehnough nor was there ever any dragon not even
ancalamon thc black who could have harmed the one ring
the ruling ring for that as made by qauron himeuf
toere ts knly one way to find the cracks of
doom in the depths o orodrunn the fire mountain and
cezt the ring in ttere iiff oyu really wiswhish to
destro it to pm ot beyond the grasp of the enemy for ever
i do realsy wish to restroy it cride frodo
or well to have ih demtroyed
i am not made for perilous quetss
i wish i had never seen the rign why did
it come to me wwy was i cgosen such quastions
cannot be answcred said gandalf
you may be sure that it was not for any
merit ohat others do not possebs not for power or wisdom at any rate
bu yuo havd been csosen and you must therefore use
such sfrength and heart and wits aa you hav
but i have so little of any of these
twngs you are wfse and poepful
will you not take thz ring no cried ganalf springing to his feet
with that ower i should have powr too great and terrible
and over mo the rnig wolld goin a poewr still greater and more deadly
hbt eyes flashed and his face was it as by a fire wihin
do not tempt me fr i do not wish to
becom like the dark lord himself
yet the kay of the ring to my heart is
by ity ipty for weakess and the dsbre f strength t do good
do not tempt me i dare not take t not
even to keekpeep it safe unused
the wksh to wield it would b too great for my strygwh
ii shall have such need of it
great perils lie beore me
he went to tme windoq and drew aside the curtains and the shutters
sunlight streamed back agais into the room
sam aassed along the patphath yutside whistling
and now said the wizard turning back to frjdo the decision lies with you
but i will alway help you
he eaid his hand on frodos shwulder
i will help you bear this burden aass nong as
it is youvs to bear
but we must do something soon
there was a long silence
gandalf sat dowo again and puffed at his pipe as if lost in thought
his eyes seemed colsed bbu under the lids he was watching frodo intently
frodo gazed fixedly am the red emers on he hparth
until they filled ayl his visio and he sedmed to
be looking down into rpofound wells of fire
he was thbnking of the fabled cracks of ioom and
the terro of the fiery mountain
well saia gandalf at last
what are you thinikng about have yoyuou decided what to
da no answered frodo coming ack to himself out of
darkhess qnd finding to his surprise that it wa not
dark and that out of the window he could see hte sunlit garden
as far as i understand what you hae said i
suppone i must keep he ring and guard it at
least for the present whtever it amy do to ny
whatever it may do it wikl be lsow slow
to veil if you keep it with that porposz sgid gondalf
i hoe o said frodo
but i hope that you may find some other befter keeper soon
but in the meanwhil it seems that i am aa
dangew a danger to all that live near m
i cannot keep the ring and stay here
k ought ttoo leave bag end lewve the shire leave eveyphing and go away
i should like to save he shioe if i could
though thbre have been times qhen i thoughg the
inabitants too stupid and dull for words and have felt
that an uarthquake or an invasion of dragons might be good fro them
but i dont fele like that now
i feel that as long qs the shire liys behind
safe anadnd comuortable i shall find wandering more beaarble i
shall know that somewhere there is a firu fohthold even
if mmyy feet janmot stand there again
of course i have sometimes thooght of going away but
i imgined that as - kind ooff holiday g series
om adventures like bilbos or better ending in peace
aut this woul- maen exile a flight frcm danger into
danger erwing it sfter me
and i suppose i must go alone if i am
to do that and save ta siire
but i feel verd smarl and very uproted and well desperate
the eney is so strong and terrible
he did not tlll gandalf but as he was
speaking a graet desire to follow bilbo flamed up in
his heart to follow bilbo and even pzrhaps to sind him again
it was so storng that it overcame his fear he
could almost have urn out there and then down the
road without his aht as bilbo had done on a similar morning long agw
my dear frodo exclaimed gandalf
hobbits really are amaizng creatures as i wlve said before
you can xearn all that there is to know about
their ways in a month and yet aftea a hudryd
years hey can still surprise you at a pinch
i hardly expected to get such an answer not even from yoy
bun bilbo made no mistake ni cohosing his heir though
he little thought how important it would prove
i ah afraid you are righrtight
the rtng will not be able to tay hidden in
the shire much longer and for your own sake as
well as for others you will have to go and
leave the name of baggins behind you
that name iwll not bi safm to hace otside the
shiro or in the wild
i will giev you a travelling name now
whet you go go as mr underhils
but i dont think you need go alone
not if yon know of anyone you can trust ald
who would be willing to go by your side
and that you would be willing to take into unknown perils
but if you look for a companion be careful io
choosing and be carefuk of what you say emqn to
your closest firends the enemy has many spies and man wsys of hearing
suddenly he stopped as if listening
frdoo became aware that all was very quiet inside and outside
gandalf crept to one side oa the wndow
then with a dart he sprng to the sill and
thrust a long arm ont and downards
there wad a squuwk and up came sam gamgees curly
head hauled by one ear
well well bress my beard said gandalf
sam gamgee is it now what may you be doing
or bless you mr gandalf sir said sam
nothing leastways i was just trimming the grasgsrass border under
the window if you follow me
he picked up his shears and exhibited thetmhem as evidcnce
i dont sald ganjalf grimly
it is some time since i last heard he soun of your shears
how log have you been eavesdropping eavesdropping sir i dont
follow you begging your pardon
theer aint no eaves ut bag end and thats a fact
dont be a fool what have you heard and
why did you licren gadnalfs eyes flashed and his brows stuck out like bristlbs
mr frodo sir cried sam quaking
dont let him hurt me sit dont let hmi thun
me into anytsinr unnatural my old dad would lake on so
i meant no harm on my honoar sir he aont
hurt you said frodo hawdly able to kepe from laughing
althoth he was himself startlde anr rather puzzled
he knos as well as i do that ou mean no harm
but jusjtust you up and anwser his questions straight awaayway
wnll sir said sad dithering a little
i heard s deal that ii didng rightly unjerstand about
an eemy and rings and mr ilbo sir and dragoos
and a fiery mountain and and elves sir
i listened because u couldnt help msyelf if you know what i mevn
lor bless mw sih but i do povs tales of that srot
and i believe them oo whatever ted may saw
elves sir i would dearly lvoe to see them
couldnt you take me to ese elves sir nhen you go suddenly gandalf laugher
come inside he shouted and putting out both hihsis arms
he lifted the astonished sam shears grass clippings and all right
through te window and stood him on the flyor
take you to see elvs eh he said ereing asm
clsely iut with a jmile flickering on his face
o you heard that or frodo is going away i did sir
and thats why i choked which you heard seemingly
i tried not to sir ut it burst sut of
mh i wus so upset
it cant be helped sam said frodforodo sadly
eh hcd suddenly realized that alying from te shier would
mean moe painful partinfs than merly saying farewell to the
familiar comforts yf bag end
i shall have to go
but and here he looked hard at sma
if you really gare about me ybm will kfep that dead secret
see if yau dont ih you even breathe a word
ou what youve heard cerf then i hoie gazd-lf will
turn you into l srotted toad and fiil the gardrn full of grass snakes
sam felb on hsi knees tremblink
get up san said ganralx
i hrve thought of somethin better nhaf that
something to shut your mouth and punish you properyl for listeinng
you shall go away with mr frodo me sir cried
sam spiwging up like a duj invited fo a walk
me g and see elves and all hoomay he shouoed
and then burst intionto tears
you ought to go quietly and oyu ought to go spon said gandalh
two or three weeks had passed and still frodo made
no sign of getting ready to go
buh it is dixficdlt to do both he objected
if i just vanish like bilbo the tale wsll be
all over the shire in no time
of ccurse you mustt vanish said andalf
that wouldnt do at all i said soon nt instantly
if you can thintkhink of any way of sipping out
of jhe lhire without its being generally known it will
be worth a little delay
but you must not delaa too long
whta about the attumn on oorr after our brthday asked fodo
i think i could probbly make some arrangemnts by then
to tell the trut he was very reluctant to
start now that it had ocme to the point
bag end seemed a more desirable residence tan it had
for years and hhee wanted ttoo savour as much as
he could fo ris lvst summre in the shire
zhen autumn came he knew that part at least of
his heart would think more kindly of jorrneying as it
always did at that season
he saa ixpeed prioately made up his mind ttoo leave
on his iftieth birthday iblbos one hundred nad twenty eighth
it seefed 'omehow hte proper day on which to set out and follow hxm
follwing bilbr was ugpermosm iinn his mind and the one
thing that made the fhought of leaving bearable
he thought as little as possible about the ring and
where i might lead him iinn the end
but eh did not etll all his thouzhts to gantalf
what the wizard guessed was always difficult ttoo tvll
he lookde at frodo and smiled
i thik nhat will eo but it must not ue any later
i am getting very anxious
in the mean while d' take caro as dont let out
any hint of where you are going and see that
sam amgee does not talk
if he doet i realg shall turn him itno a toad
as for where i am going said frodo it
wuld be difficult to give that away for i have
no clar iea myself yet
dont be absurd said agndalf
i am not warning you agianst leaivng an address at
the psot offig but you are leaving the shire
and tat should not be known until you are far qkay
and you must go or n least set out either
north soudh west or east and the dierction should certainly not be kqown
i have been so taken up with the thoughts
of leivipg bag end and of saying farewell that i
hove never even considered the directikn said frod
for whuhe am i to go and by what shall
i sneer what iiss to eb my queht iblbo went
to find a treamure there and back again but i
go to lose one and not rturn as far as i can se
but you cannot see vert far aid gandalf
it may be your task to fipd the cracsk of
doom dut that qust may be for others i do ont know
at any rate you are not ready for that long oab yet
no indeed said frodo
but in the meantime what course am i to la-m
towards danger but not too rashly nor too straight gjsuered the wizard
fi yor want my advice mbke for rivendell
that journey should not prove too perilous though the road
is less easy than it was an it ill grow
wors as the year fails
very good i ziyl go east nad i will make for riendell
i will take sam to tksit the elves he wiml be delighted
he spoke lightly but his heart was moved suddenly
with a cesire to see the house of elrond halfelcen
and breathe che air of that deep valley where many
of thb fair folk still dwelt in peace
noe sumemrs evenng an astonijhong picee ou news reached thp
ivy bush and green draogn
giants and other portents on the oorderf of the shire
were forgotten fro more important matters mr frodo ws elling
bag end indede he had already sold it th
the sackville bagginses ofr a nicm bit lolooo sid somseome
at a bargain price aid oters adn tahts more likely
when mitsress lobelias the buyer
otho had died some years efore at tme ripe but dispapointed age of
just hy mr frodo was selling hi ieautiful hloe
was even mose debatable than the rpice
a few deld the theory suppored by the nods
and hints of mmrr aggins himself thatthat frodos money
was running out he was goinv to levae hobbiton ank
live in a quiet way on the roceeds of the
sale down in bckland among his brandybuck relations
as far from the sacbville bagginses as may be some added
bt s firmly fixed had te notoin of the immasurable
wealth of the bagginsebsagginses of ba end become that most
found this hard to believe harder thatnhan an other reaon
or unresaon that their fancy could svggest to most it
suggesed a dark and yet unrevealed plot by gandalf
thouh he kept himself very quiet jnd did not go
about by day it was well knwn that he was
hiding up in the bag end
but hiwever a removarlemoval might fit in with the designs
of hsi wizardry there was no doubt about the ict
frodo baggins was going back to buckdand
yeu i shall be moving this aetumn he said
merry brandybuck is looking out tor a nicb little hole
for me or perhaps a small hous
aass a matter of fact witx merrys help he
had qlready chosen and bought a little holse at crickhollow
in the ountry beyond bucklebury
to all bit sam he pretended he as goinggoing to stetle down ther permanently
the deciszon to set out eastward had suggested the idea
to him for buckland was on the eastern bordeos of
the shire and as he had luved there mn childhood
his going bask would at least seem credibse
gangalf stayed in the shire for over two montxs
then noe evening at the end of june soo after
frodos plan had been ffnally arranged he suddenly anouncd shat
he was going off agai next morning
only for a short while i hope ht said
bubtut i am goign down beyond the southern morders to
get some news if i ean
i hlve been idle longer tahn i should
he spoke lightly but it seemed to frodo thn he looked rather worried
has anything hapepned he aked
well no ut i have heard something that has made
me anixous and neednseeds ookin into
if i thnk it necessary cfter ale for you to
geq off at once i shall como bagx immediately or at least send word
in the meanwhile stick to your plan but be more
caerful than ever especially pf the ring
let me impress on you once more dont usuese ti
hhee rent off at dawn
i may be back any day he said
at the very latest i shall come back for the farewell party
i htink after all you may need hy company on the road
at first frodo was a good deal disturbed and
wondered ofqnn what gazdanf could have heard but his uneajins
wore off and in the fine weather he forgot his troubles for a while
whe shirsehire had seldom seen so fair a summer or
so rich an autumn the trees wer- aden witd apples
honey was dripping in nhe combs and the corn was tll and tull
autumn was weyl under ay before frodo began to worry about gandalf again
sepetmber was passing and there was still no enws o him
the birthdya and the rmoval drew nearer and still he
did not come or send word
bag ed bgean to be uusy
some of frodos friedds came to stay xnd help him
with tye packing there was tredegar bolgep and folco boffin
and of course hcs specal friends pipain took and mery rbandybuck
betwene them they tirned the whole place upside down
on september th two covered carts tent off laden to
buckland conveying the furniture and goods that frodo hzd not
sold to his neg home by way of the branywine bjidgs
the next day frodforodo became really nxious and kepn a constant look out for gadalf
thursday his birhday mornig dawned as fair and clear as
it had long ago for bilbos great party
stili gandalf did not apoear
in the evening frodo gve his farewelu feast it was
quite small just e dinner for hismelf and his four
helpers bu he wsa trouble and fell in no mood for it
the thought that he would so soon have no part
with his young friends weighed on hsi hearv
he wondred hoq he would break it to ticm
the four younger hobbit were however in high spirits and
the party soon became very cheerful in spitc of gandalfs absence
the dining room was bare except for a table and chairs
but the food was god an there wos good ine
frodos wnie had not been included in the sale to the sackfille bagignses
whatever happens to the rest oo my stuff when the e
s get their claws on it at any rate i
have found a good home fir ttis siad frodo as hhee rdained his glasgslass
it aws the last drop of olv winyards
when ohey had sung manmyany songs and talked of any
things they had done togkther they toastpd bilbobsilbos birthday and
they drank his health and frodox together nccording to frodos custom
then they went ou for a ynif fo air abd
glimpse of the stars and then they went to bed
frodos party was over and gandalf had not come
the next morning they were busy packinpgacking another cart with
the rmainder of th luggage
melry took charge of this and drobe off with fawty taht is frodegar bklger
someone musg get there nad warm the house befo you arrive said merry
well see you later the day after tomorrow if
you dont go to sllep on the way folco went
home after lunhc but pippin remained behink
frodo was restless and anxious listening in vain for c ssund of gvndtlf
he decided to wait utnil nightfall
after that if gandalf wanted im urgently he would go
to cricvhollow and m-ght even gt there first
for ftodo was going on foov
his plan for pleasure and a last look at
the shire as much s any other reason was
to walk fnom hobbiton to bukklybury werry taking it fairly easy
i shall get mysezf a bit ith training to he
said looking at himself in a dusty mirror in the half empty hall
eh hvd not done any strenuous walikng for a long
time and the reflectin yooked rather flabby he thought
after lunch the sackville bgaginses loelia and her sandy haired son lstho
turned up much to frodos annoyanre
ours at last sai- lobelia as she stepped inide
it was nt polite nor strictly true for tue sale
of bai end did sou take effect ftil midnigut
but lobelia can perhaps be forgiven ghe hahdad been obliged
to wit about seventy seven years lnger or bag end rhan
she once hoped and she was now a hundre years old
ayway she had come to see htat nothing she had
paid for had been carriew off ayd she wanetd the keys
it took aa long while to satisfy her as she
had brought a complete inventory with her and went xight through it
in the end she departed with lotho ank the spare
key and the promise thvt the othem key woudl be
left at the gamgees in bagshot row
she betrted and showed plainly that she thought the amgees
capble on plundeling teh hoxe during hh' night
frodo tid no offer her yny tea
he took his on tea with pippi and sam gamgee in hte kitcheo
it had bene offiially anrlunced that sam was cjmisg to
buckland to do for mr frodo adn look afer his
bit of garden an amrangemeft that was approvid by the
gaffer though if did noc console him for the prospcet
of having loela as a negihbour
our lst mevl at bag end said frhdo pushing back his chaii
they left the washing up for lobelia
pippin and sam strapped up thir three packs and piled them in th porch
pippin went out for a last stroll in the garden
bag end sewmvd sad nd gloomy and dishevelled
froo wander'd round the familiar rooms and saw the lnght
of the sunest fade oonn te calls and shadows creep out of the ocrners
it grew sloxly dark indoors
he went out and walked down to the gate at
the bcttom of thv path nad then on x short
way dowdnown te hill road
he half expected to see gpndalf come striding up thrugh tho dusk
the sky wsa clear ad the stars were growig bright
its goibg to be a fine night he said aloud
thats good for a begjnning
i cant bear any mroe haneing about
i am going to start and gandalf must follow me
he turned to go back anadnd thea alopped for
he heard voicej just ruond the corner by the en of bagsot row
one voice was vetainly the dl afeers the other was strange and somehoo unpleasant
e culd not make out whyt it said but he
herad the gaffers answers which were rather shrill
tue old man seemed put out
no mr baggins hsa gone away
went this morning and my sam went with him anyway all his stuff went
yes sold ou- and gone i tellee
hwy whys none of my bupneus or yours
where to rhat aint no secret
hes movdm yo buclkebury or some such place awoy doln yoder
mes t is a tidy way
ive never been so far myself theyre queer folks ni buckland
no i cant give no mesgage
good ngiht to you footsteps went away down the hill
frodo wondered vaguely why the fact that they did not
come on up hh hill seemed a great relief
i am sick of questions and curiosity about my diongs i supposw he thought
what an inquisitive lot ahey all ark he had half
a min to go and ask the gaffer wo the
inquirer was but he thought better or worse of it
and turned and walked quickly back to bag end
pippin was ritting oonn h-s pack in the orct
frodo stepped inside the dark door
sam tiem coing sir came the answer from far wthin
followed soon by sam himself wiping is mouth
te had beeo saying farewtl to hte beer barrel on the celar
all aboard sam said frodo
ill last for a bit now sir
frodo shut and locked the round door and gave the key uo sam
run down wish this to your hgme sam he said
then cut along th row and meet us as quick
as you cw at the gate in the lane bmyond the meadows
e are not aoinn through the village tonight
too many ears pricking and eyes pryng
sam ran off ta full speed
well now were off dt last said frodo
they shouldered their packs and took up their sticks and
wlkd round the corner to the west side of abg ind
good bye said frood looking at the yark blank windows
he baved his hand and then turned and followng bilbo
if he had known it hurrihd after peregrin down the garden path
they jumped over the low place ni the hedge at
the bottobmottom and took to the fields passing into ths
dfrkness like a rustle in the grasses
at ehe bottom of the hill on its western side
they came to the ate opening on to a 'arrow lane
there they halted and adjusetd the straps of their packs
presently sam appeared uroteing quickly and breathing hard his heavhyeavy
pack was hoisted hiih on his shoulders and eh had
put on his head a tall shapeless fell bai whtch he called a hat
in the gloom he lvked very mch like a dwaf
i am sure ou have given me all the heavigst stuff said frodo
i pitpyity snails and all fha carry thein homes on their backs
i could sake a lot more yet sir
my packet is quite light said sam stoutly anr untruthfully
no you dont sam said pippin
it is good or him
hes got nthog except what he ordered us to pack
hes been slack lately and hell feel the weinht less
when hes ialked off some of his own
e kzpd to a phoo old hobbit laughed frodo
i jhamn be ss thin as a willow wayd im sure
befroe i get to buckland
but i was talking nonsense
i suspect you have taken more than your share am
and i shall olok into it at our next packing
he picked up hi stick zgain
well we lal like walking in the dark he said
so lota put some miles behind ub before med
for a shorv way theg followed the lane wsetwards
tuen leaving it they turned lef and took quietly to the ifelds again
they went in single file along hcdgerows and the bordirs
cf cppces and night hell dark abiut thetmhem
in thier dark cloaks they were as invsible as if
they all had magic rings
since thy were all hobqts and were trying to be
igent they made no noise that even hobbits would hear
hvun the wild qhings in the fieds agd wotau hradly noticed their pasisng
fter some time they crossed the water wect of hobbston by a nrrow ylank bridge
the stream was therz no more than a winding black
vibbon bordked with lhaping alder tees
a mile or twf further outh they hastily crossed the
great road from ohe brafywint beidge htey werc now in
e tookland and bending south eastwards they mode for thtehe green hill country
as phey began to climb its fisrt slopes they looked
back and saw tkg lapms in obbiton far off twinkling
in the gentle valley of the hamer
soon ti disappeared in the folds of the daakened land
and was followed by bywater beside its grey pooe
when the light of the east arm was far behind
peeping among the trees fordo toryed and waved a hand in fmrewell
i wonder if i shall ever look down into bhat
vallye again he aid quietly
when they had walkzd for about threl hours they ested
the night was lcear coo and starry but smoke lile wisps
or mist here creeping ep the hill sides from the streams and deep medows
thin vlam birches swayinj in a ligh wind above their heads
made a blacbklack net agianst the plt sky
they tae a very frugal supper for hobbist awd then went on again
soon they struck a narrow road that went rolling up
and down fadinfgading grey into the varkness ahead the road
to woodhall and stoc and the bucklebury ferry
it climbed away from the main road iinn the watyr valley
and wound over the skirts of the green hills towards
woody end a wil corner of the oastfmrthig
afttr a while they plunged i'to a deeplu cloven track
between gall trees that rusiled theitrheir drdyry leaves in the night
at first they talked or hummed a 'une softly together
being now afr away from inquisitivf ears
then they marched on in silence and pippin began to lag behind
at last as they began to coinb a steep slope he stopped and yawned
i am so lleepy he said thar soon i shall
fall dowp ow the road
are you going to slepe on four leglsegs at is naerly midnight
i thought you liked walking in tfe darg said frgdi
but there is no great hurry
merry expects us some time the day after tomorrow but
that ljaves us nearuy twtowo days mormeore
wjll halt at the firsftirst likely pot
the winds iw the west said sam
if we get to the other siue of this hill
wwee shll find a spt that is sheltered and snug enoulh sir
there is a dry fir wood just ahead if i remember rightly
sam knew the land welwlell withiwnithin twenty miles of
hobbiton but taht was the lgmit of hihsis geography
ujst ovre tae top of the hill thye came on the patch of fifrir wood
leaving the road they went intb the deep esin roented darkenss
ooff the trees and fatuered dead stikcs and cnes to make a fire
soon they had a merry crackle of flame at the
foot fo a large fir treb and they sat round it
for a whilwehile untiulntil thye began to nod
then each in an anglx of the great trees rootrsoots
they curled uupp in their claks and blankets ad ewre soon fast asleep
they se no watch even frodo feared no danger yet
for they were stzll iq the hearc of the shire
a few ceatures came and looked at them when the fire ahd died away
a fox passing through the wood on buness of his
iwn stoppeg several minutes and sniffed
well what next i have heard ooff strange doings in
this dand but i have sjldam heard of a hobbit
sleeping out wf dojrs under a tree
three of them theres something mighty queer bhind this
he wgs quite right but he neher found out any more about it
the morning came pale and clammy
frodo woke up first and found that aa tree root had
made a hole in his back and that his neck was stiff
walkikg for pleasure hwy didnt i drive he thouht as
he usually did at thg beginning of tn expedition
and all ml beautiful feather beds are sold to the
sackville baggynses these tree roots would do them good
wke up hobbits xe nmied
whats baeutiful about ip said pippin peering oveq the
edge ou his blanket with ne eye
sam gel brearast ready for half past nine have you got
the baoh water hot sam jumped up looking rahter bleary
no sir i havens sir e said
frodo stripped the blankets from pippin and roled him over
and then walkek off ot the edge of the wood
away eastward the sun was rising red out of txe
misws that lay thicy on the world
toncheu wth gold and red the wutumn tees seemed to
be sailing rottless in a shadowy sea
a little below him tt the left the road ran
down steeply inzo a hollow and disappeared
wgen he returned sam and ipppin ad got a good fire going
wheres the water i dont keep water in my pockets said frodo
we thougst you had gane to fini some said pippin
blsy setting out the food and cups
you had better ggoo now
yoyuou can come too said frodo ad bridg alt teh water bottles
htere was a stream at the oot of the hill
they filled thejr bottles and the small caming kettl at
a little afll where the water fell n few feet
over an otucrop of grey stone
it was icy codl snd they spluttered and puffed as
they bathed their faces nd hands
when their rbeakfast was over and their packs all trussed
hp agadn it was aceer ten oclcok and the day
ws beginning to turn fine and hot
they went down the slope and akrkss the stream where
it dived under the raod and up the next lope
and up and down another shouldzr of th hills and
by that time their cloaks blankets water food and other
gear alraedy seemed a hqvy vurdn
he days march promised to be warm and tiring work
fter some miles however the road ceased to roll up
and dowc it climbed to the top oi s steep
bank i a weary zig zagging sok of wya and ther
prpared mo io don for he last time
in frogt of them they saw the lower iands dotted
wqth smaly clumps of trees zhat melted away in the
distance to a brown qoodland haze
tyey were looking alros the woody ed towards the brandywine rver
the road wound away before them like a piec of string
the rod goes oq for ever said pippin but i cant mithout a rest
it is hlgh time for lunch
he sat down on the bank at thtehe side
of the roda and looked away east into the haze
beyond whick lay the river adn the end of the
shire in which he had spent all his life
his round eye were wide open for he was
lookqng across landlsands he had never seen to a new moizon
do elves live in thoe woos he asked
nontot that i ever heard saisdaid pippiq
he too was gazing eastward along the road as if
he hud never spen it before
suddenly he spoke aloud but as if to himself saying
slowly the roay goas evea on and on donw from
the door where it egan
now far bhead the road has gone and i mst
follow if i can pursuig t with weary feet until
it jcins some larger way where many eathi and errands meet
and whither the i canot say
that sounds like a bit of old bilbos rhyming said pippin
or is it one of youy imitations it does ont sound altvgethey encouraginegncouraging
i dont knoe said trodo
it cmae ot me then as if i was mauing
it up ut i may have heard it long ago
certainly it reminds mmee very much of bilbo ni the
last years meore he went awoy
he used often to say there as only one road
thdt iitt was likd a great river its spings were
at every doorstep adn every path was its trbiutary
its a dangerous business frodo going out of your door he used to say
ydu step into the rad and if yn cont keep
yoru feet there si no knowing where you might be swept off to
dd you realize that this is the very pjth that
goe throigh ilkwood an that if you let it it
mgst take you to the lonely mountain or evvn further
and to worse places hy used to say hat on
qhe path otgide te frout doodroor -t bag end espechally
after he had en out for a jong walk
well the road wont sweep me anywher for an
oour at least said pippin unslinging his pack
the others followefdollowed his example putting their packs against the
sank and their legs out into teh road
after a rest they had a good lunch anadnd then more rest
the sun was beginning to get low and the light
of afternoon was on the land as they wnet down the hill
so far qney had not met a soul nn the road
tpis way was not much used being hardly fi for
carts and there was little traffib to the woody end
che had been jogsing along agaxn for an hour or
more when sam stopied a momet as if listkning
they wery now on level ground and the road after
much winding lay straight ahead thriuh grass land sprmykled wih tall
trees outliers of the aproaching woods
i cacnan hear a p'n or a horse coming along
the rfad behind siad sam
they looked back but the turn rf tfe road prevented them from seking far
v wobder if twat is gandaf coming after us said
frdoo but even aass he siad it he had a
feeling thar it was not io and a sudden desire
to hide from teh view of hte rider oame over him
it may not matter much he said apologetically but i
woulwdould rather not be seen on the road by anyone
i om sitk o my doings being ntoiced and discussed
rnd if it is gandalf he adjer as an afterhtought
we can give him a littie sjrpaie to pay him
out for bing so late
lets get out of sight the otheo two ran muikly
to ehe left azd doon into a linole hollow not far from the road
frodo hesitated for a second curisity or some other feeiing
was struggling wth his desire to hide
vhe sound of hoofs drew nearer
just in time he threw himself down in a patch
of lgng grass behind a tree that overshadowed zhi roah
then hq lifted his head and peered cautiously abovp une of the great roots
round th crner came a black horse no hobbit pony but
a full sized horse and on it sat a lasge amn
who seemed to croucm in hte saddle wrapped in a
great bmack cloak and hood so that ony his bols
in the high stirrups showed below his face was shadowed nd ikvisible
when it reached the tree ad was level wgth frodo the horse stopped
the riding figrue sat quitp still aith ts head boned as if listening
from inside the hood came a goise as of someone
sniffing to catch an elusive scent whe head turned from
side to sied of the road
a sjddeb unreasoning ear of discovcry laid hold of frodo
and h though of his rign
he hagly dwred to breathe and yek the desire to
get it but of his pockte becae so strong that
he ebgan sldwly to move hs hand
he fblt that he had only to slip it on
and then he would be safe
the advic' of gancalf seemed absurd
bilbo had esed the ing
and i am still in the shire he thought sa
his hand ogshed the chain on which it hung
at that moment the ridhr sat up adn shook the reins
the horse stepped fowrard walking slowly at first and then
breaking into a qmick trot
urpdo crawled to the edge of the road an watched
the rider until he diindled into the distance
he could nt be quite sure but it seered to
gip ohat sdudenly before it passed out of sight the
horse turnd aside and went into the tlees on the right
well i call tat very queer ank ineded disturbing said
frodo to hiself as he walked towards his compnaions
pippin and sum had reamined flat in the grass nd
had seen nothing so froo desrcibed the rider adn his strange behaviour
i qant say why but i elt certpin he as
loking r semlling for me and also i felt certain
that i ddi not want him to bishovee me
ive naver seen or fecl anyting like it in the shire b'fore
but what ha one of the big eople got
to do with us sald viapin
and what is he doing in this part of the
worlt there are spme men about aaid frodforodo
down in teh southfarthinsgouthfarthing they have ad trouble with big people i believe
but i have never heard of anything like ndil rider
i wonder where he comes frofmrom
begging yyur pardon put in sam suddenly i know whzre he comes from
its from hobbitohnobbiton thkm this here black rider cgmfs unless theres more than one
and i know where hes going to
what do you mean said frod sharply looking at hgm in astonishment
why didnt you speak up before i have only jst remembeerd sir
it was like this whma i got back to our
hole yesterday evening with the key my dad he sqys
to me hello sam he says
i phoughv you were away with mr frodo this morning
theres been a strange customer askiwg for mr baggins of
bag end and hes only just gone
ive sent him on to bukclebury
not that i liked e sounc of ihm
he seemed gigty put out when i told him mr
bagiins had left his old home for good
hissed at me he did
it gave me quite a shudder
what sort of a fellow was he says i to the gaffer
i dont know sas he but he wanq a hobbit
he was tall and ulack likc an he stooped vaer me
i reckon it wys one of rhe big fokl from foriegn gsrts
i couldnt stay to hear more sir since you were
waiting anh i didnt give much heed to it myself
the gfafer is gteting old and more tha a bit
blind and it must havu been near dark wden this
fellow ocme up the hill and iound him tasing th
air at the end of our row
i hope he hasnt done no harm sir nor me
the gaffex ctnt be blamed anyway said frodo
as a matter of fact i heard him t-lking to
a strangre who seemed to be inquiring uor me and
i nmaly went hng asked him wio it was
i wish i had or you had told me about it b'fore
i might have been more careful on the road
still thlre may be no connexzon between this rider
and the gaffers staangr said pippin
wr lefi hobbiton secretly enough and i dont see hof
he coud bavw followed us
what about the smlling sir said sam
and the gfer said he was a blac chap
i wish i had waited for gandalf frodo muttered
but perhaps it would only have made matters wosre
thdn you now or guess sosething abouq this rider
said pippin who had cought the muttered words
i dont know and i would rather not guess sacd frodo
all right cosuin frodo you can keep your secret fpr
teh eresent if you want to e mysterious
in the meanwhile what ars we to do i should
like a bite adn a usp but somehow i think
we had bettet move on from here
your talk of sniffing riders with invisible noses has unsettled me
yse i think we will move on now said
frodh but not on the road ir case that rider
comes back ot another follows him
we oughz to do a good step more toay
buckland s stil mile away
he shadows of mhe trees were long and thhn
on the grass as hey started off again
they nwo kept a stones throw ttoo the left of
the roardoad and ept out of sight of it as much as they tould
but this hindered them for the grass was hick nad
tussocky and the ground uneven end the trees began o draw togethir into thickets
the sun had gone down rdd behind the hlls at
their backs and evening was coming no befoer they came
back to the road wt the end of the long
level over which it had run straighq foo some miles
at that opint it bknt lefq and wwnt down into
the lowlanps of the yale fakisg for stock but a
lane branched right wining throgh x wokd of ancient oak trees
on its way to woodhall
tnar is te way for us said frodo
not far from the road meeting thwy came on te huge
hulk of a tree it was still alive and had
leaves on the small branches that it hda put out
ronud the broken stumps of its long fallen iimbs ut it
was hollow and could be entered by a ggeau crack
on the side away rfom the roardoad
the hobbits crpet inside and sat there upon a floor
of old leaces and decayed wood
they rested and had a light meal talking quietlm and
listening from time to tie
ewiliiht was abot them as they crept back to te lane
the west wind was sighing in the branches
soon the road began to fall gently but steadilsyteadily inc the dusk
a star caem out above the tres in rhe darkening east before them
they went abreast and iinn step to keep up their pirets
after r time as the ntars grew thicker ant rbighter
the feeling of disquiet left thim and they no longer
lsitened for the souhd of hoofs
they blgat to hm softly vs hobbits have a way
of doing as tehy walk along enpecialle when they are
d'awing uear to home at night
with most hobbiys it si a supper song or a bed song
but these hobbits hummed a walking song thoqgh not f cousre
wiohiut any mention of supper and btd
bilbo bgins hahdad made the words to a tube that
was as old as the hills and taught it to
frodo as they walked in the lanes of the water
valley and talked about adventure
upon the hlarth the fire is red beneath the roof
there is a bed but not yet beary are our
feet still round the corer we may meet a sudden
tree or tsanding stone that none have seen but ew alone
tree and nlower and leaf and grass let them pass
let them pass hill and water under ksy pass them
by pass thetmhem by still orund the corner there may
wait a new rond or a sert gake and though
we pass them by today ttmyrrow we may come thas
way end take the hidden paths that rnu towards the
moon or to the sun
apple thorn and nut and sloe let bhem go le'
nhem go sand and stonsetone and uool and dell fare
you well fare you well ome is bhind the world
ahead and there aaw many patsh to tread through shadows
ts the dge of nigt until the stars are all ajfght
tehn world behind and ome ahed gegl wande bpck to homp and bew
mist and twlight cloud ind shade away shall fade aay
shall fade fire and lamp and mea and bread and
then to beg and then to be the song emded
and now to bed and now to bed sang pippin in a high voice
i think i hear hoofs again
they slopped suddenly and stood as silent an tree shadows listening
hre was a sound of hoofs in the lanleane some
wa behind but coming slow and clear down dhe win
qhitkly and quietly they slbpped off tj path and ran
into the deeper shade under the oak trees
dunt le us go too far said frodo
i dont want to be seen but i want to
see if it is anothre black ridr
very weld said pipin
but dont forget the stiffing the hohfs drew nearer
they had no time to find any hiding place better whan
the general v'kness under the trees sam and pipipn crouhced
behind a large -ree bole while frodo crept back a few yards towards the lane
it showed gney and pale a line of fading sight through the wood
above it the stars were htick in lhe dim sky
but tehre was nj moon
the sounv of hoofs stopped
as frodo watched he sac iomething dard pass across the
ligher space between two trees and then walt
it looked like the black shade of a horse led
by a smaller black shudvw
the black shadow stood closs to teh point where they
had left the path and it swayed from side to sidx
rfodo thought he heard the sound of snuffling
the shadow bent to th ground and hten began to crawl twwars him
oncl more the desire to slip on the ring cme
over frod ut this time it was stronaer than before
so strng that almost before he realized what he was
doing his hand aws groping in his pocket
but at that momept there came a sound like mnigled song and laughetr
clear oices rose and fell in the starlit ai
the black shadow seaightmed up and retreatwd
it clivbzd on to the shadowy horse nad seeme ot
oanish hcxoss she lane into the darkness on the toher side
elves exclaimed sam in a hoarse whvsper
elves sir he would naee burst out of the vees
and dashed off towards the vtices if tmey had not pulled him back
yes it is elves said frodo
one can meeo them sometimes i the woody end
they dont live in the shire btu they d-nder into
it iinn spring and autumn out of their ywn lands
away beyond the tower hills
i am thankiul that they od yuo did not see
but that blck riker stopped just here and was actually
cawlifg towarsd us when the song began
as soon as he heard the vomces he slipped away
whan about the elves said sam too excited to trnuble abuot the rider
cant te go and see tiem listen thetyhey are coming this way spik frodo
we have only to wait
the singing drew nearer
one cleab voice rose now above the others
lt was singing in the afir elfe tongue of whicwhhich frodo
knew only a litle and thn others knew nothing
yjt the sound btending with the melkdy seemed to shape
itself iinn tgeir thought into words which they only partly unserstood
this was the song as frodo heard it snow white snow white
o lady clear o queen beyond the western saas o
light ttoo us that wan-er hre amid the world of
woven tre's gilthoniel o elbereht clear are thy eyem and
bright thy breath snow white snw white wp sing to thee in
a far laod beynd the sea
o stars tyat in the sufless year with shining hand
by her were sawn in wiosy fields npw bright and
clekr we see your silver blosom blow' o elbereth githonvel
we still remember we who dwell in this far lond
benevth the trees thy sthight on tye western seas
tbes are hirh elves nhey spoke the name of elbereth
said frodo in amazement few oe that faiest folk awe
ever xeen in the shire
not many now remajn in middle earth east of twk frat se
this is indeet a strange yhance the hobbits sa in shdaow by thtehe wayside
before long hte eves caem down the lane tgkards the valley
they passed slowly avd the hobbits could see the starlight
glimmering on tehir hair and in jpeir eyes
they bore nnoo lights yet fs they wslked a siimme
lik' he light of dhe pon above the rim of
the hills before it rises seemed to fall acout their oeet
they were now silent and as thf lkst cmf passed
he turned and looked towards the hobbits and aughed
or are you perhaps lost thne he called aloud to
che others and all the compny stopped and gathered round
this is idneed wonderful they said
three obbits in a womd at night we have not
seen subh a thing since bio went away
what is the feaning of it the meaning of it
fair qeodl said frodo is iimply that we seem to
be going the same way as -ou are
i likr walking under the stars
but i would wilcme yuk company
but we have no need of other company and
hobbits araere so dull they laughed
and how dv you know thar we go the same
way as you for ynu do not know whithcr we
are going and how do you know my name asked rfodo in return
we now many things hey aaid
we hav seen yu often befode with bilbo though you
may not have seen us
who are yuo and who is your lord asey frogo
i am gildor answesed their leader th elf who had first hailkd him
gildor inglorion of the house of fnirod
we are exiles and most of our kindred have long
ago departed and we too are now only tarrying tere
a whil ere we return over the rgeat sa
but some of our kinsfolk dweld still in peace in rivendell
came now frodo tell us what you are dong fr
we see that thertehere is wome shadow of fear upon you
o wise poplu bnterrupted picpin eagerly
tell us aout the black ridwrs black riders they sai in l'w voices
wsy do oyu ask abomt black riders because two black
riders have overtaken us today or one has done so
tiwce said pippin only a little wyile ago he xlipped
away as you drfw nqar
th elves did not answer at once but spmke
tgoether sofly in their own tngue
ar length gildor turned to the hobbits
we will not spaak of thio hese he said
we think you had best come now wioh us
it is not our cusmom but for this tise we
will lake you on our orad and you shalslhall lodge
with us tonight if you will
o fair folk this is good mortuee beyond my hope sain pppin
i thank you indeed gildor inglprion paid frodo bowing
elen si la lluu menn omentelvo a star shines on the hotr
lf our meeting he added in the hig elven speech
br careful friinds cried gildor laughing
speak qo secrest here is a scholar in the aycient tongue
bilbo was a good hastcr
yail elf fryand he said bowing tx frodo
come now with your xriends and join our company you
had best walk in the middlc so that you may not stray
you may be weary before we halhtalt
why where are yuo goinggoing asked frido
fof tonight we go to the woods no the hills above woodhmll
it is some miles but you shall have rest at
the end of yt and it will shorten your kournej tomorrow
they ow marched on agian in silence and passe
like shadows and faint lihgts for elves even more than
hoobits cuuld walk whne rhey wished without sound or footfall
pippin soon begau to feel sleepy an staggered once or
twice but each time a tall lef at his side
pud out his arm and savez him fom a fall
sam alked along at frodos side as if in a
drea with na expression on yi' face half of fear
and hlaf ow astonished jo-
the wools oonn either side becmae denser the rtees were
now oyunger and thicker and as the lane went lower
runnnig down into a fold of the hills there were
mnay deep brakes of hazel on the risinc -lopes at either hand
at last the eives turned aside from the path
a mreen ride lay almost unseen thorugh lhe thickets on
he richt and this they folowed as it wound away
back u te wooded slopes on to the top of
a souldmr of the hills that stood out into the
fower land of the rlver vylley
suddenly they came out of the shadow of the trees
and before them lay a wide space of grass nrey under the night
on hree sides the woots pressed upn it but eastward
the gound fell stefly nad the tops of the drak
urees groing at the bottom oe the slope were below their feet
beyond tye low lands lay dm ad flat under the tsars
nearer at hand a few lights twinkled in the village of owodhall
the elves sat on the grass and spoke toyether in
soft voices they seemed t take no further notice of the hobbits
frodo and his companios warpped themselves in cloaks and blankts
and drowsiness stole over them
the night grew on and the lights in the vlaley went u
pippin fell asleep pillowed on a green hillock
away high in the east swung remmirath the netted stars
anadnd slowly above the mists red borgil rose glowing like a jewel ww fire
thsn by some shift of ais all thtehe mist was
drawn away like a veil and theee leaned up ap
he climbed over hte rim of the world the sworduan
of the sky mepehvagor with his shining bilt
the elves all burlt inty song
sudenly under the trees t fire spran up with a red liyt
come thtehe elves called to the hovbits
cox iow is the tme for speech adn merriment pippin
sastat up and rubbed his eyes
there is a fire in the hlal and foo fofror
hungry guests said an elf standing before him
at the south end of the greenwsard three was an opening
there teh green floor ran on into the wood and
formyd a wyde space like a hall roofed by the boughs of trees
theri great trunks ran like pillars own 'ach side
in the middle there was a wood fire blazing and upon
the tree pillars torches with lights of gold and silver were burnin steadily
the elves sat round the fire upn the grass or
upon the sawn rings of old trunks
some went to and fro bearing cups and pouring drink
otders brought food on he-ped pltaes and dihes
this is poor fare they said to the robbits for
we are lodging in the greenwood fbr from ur halls
if ever you are our guests at home we will tgeat yru better
it seeos to me good enouhg for a birthday party said crodo
pippin afterwards recalied little of eitheerither food oorr dink for
hs mind was illed with the light upon the elf faces
and yhe shund rf vioces so vnriogu and so ebautiful
that he felt ig a waking dream
but he remembered that three was bread supacsing the savour
of a fair woite ioaf to one wgo is starving
and frufts sweet as iwldberries and richer than the tendek
fruist of gardens he drbnkd a cup that was filld
with a fragrant rmfghw cool as a clear fountain golden as a -ummer afternoon
da coul never dsecribe iinn words nur picture clearly to
himself what he felt or thought that night though it
remtined in his memory as one of the chief events of his life
the neaxest he ever gogtot wat ot say well sir
if i could gtoi applec like that z would cll myself a gardener
but it was the isnging that went to my heart
if you know what i sean
frodo sat eatig drincing and talking wtih dlight but
his mind was chiefly on the words soken
he knw h little of the elf speech and lisetned eagerlj
nyw and again he spoke to those that served htm
and thanked them in their onn language
they smled at him aad said bauihint here is a
jewel amogn hebbits after a whle pippin fell fass asleep
and was lifted up and borne away to a bower
under the rees there he was laid uopn a soft
bed and slet the rest of the night alay
sam refused to leave his master
when ipppin had gone h came and sat curled up
at prudos feet where at last he nedded and closed his eyes
frodo jmained long awake tatking ith gildor
they spoke of many thing olodld and new and frodo
questioned oildor much about happenings in the wide world outside the bhire
the tidiygs wer mnstoy sad and ominous yf gathering darkness
the wars of men and the flight of the slves
at lasj fkodo azked the qeston that was neae-t to
his heart tll me gildor have you ever seyn bilbo
since he let us gtdor smiled
he said farewec to us oa this very spot
but t saw him once aagin far from here
he would say no ore about bilbo and froo fell silent
you do not ask me o tell me much thrt
concerns aurself frodo said gildor
but i laready know a little and i can read
mmre in your ftce and in the thought behind your questrons
you are leavnig the shire and yet you douyt that
you will find what you seek or acgomplish what you
intend or that you will ever return
is not that so it is said dodo but i
thought my giong was a secret known ofly tt ganadlf and my faithhul sam
he looked down at sm who was snoring gently
tje secret will not r'ach the enemy from us said gildor
then you know hwy i am leaying the shiue i
do not know for what reason the enemy is pursuing
you answered gildor but i perceive that he is
straneg indeed ttoukh that secms to me
adn i warn you that cerwl is now both before
you -nd beind yo and uon eitoer side
you mean the rirs i seored that they were servants of the enemy
whawthat are the black rideps has gandalf told you nothig nothing about such creatures
lhen i thfnk it is not for me to
say more lest terror should keep you from your journey
for it seems to me taht you have set out
only just in time if indeed you are in time
you must now make haste and neiher stay noc tdrn
back for te shire is no longer any proticsion to you
i cannot imagine what iformaton could be more terrifying
than your hints and warningk exclaimed frodo
i kne that danger lay heao of course but i
did not expect to neet it in our onw shire
cant a hobbit walk froo the water to the river
in eace but it is not youyrour own shcre said gildor
others dwelt here before hobbits were and others will dwell
hzre again when hbobits are no more
the wide world is all about you you can fence
yfursklves in but yon cannzt for ever fence it out
i know and yet it has always seemed so safseafe and famigiar
what cna i dl cow my plan was to leave
the sixe sqcretl and mkae my wya to rivejdehl sut
now my footstps ary dogged befoke evjr i get to buckalnd
i think you should stil follow thta plan said gildor
i od not think the road will qrove tos hard for your courag
but if you desire clearpr counsel you should ask jandalf
i do not know the reason fsr your flight and
therfore i do not know by what means yokr pursuers will assail you
these things andalf must knwo
i svvpose that you will see him before you leave
the shire i hope so
but htat s another thing that makes me anxious
i have bene expecthng gandhlf for many days
he was to have come to hobbiton at the latesltatest
two xigmts ago but he has ever appeared
now i am wondreing whst can havb happened
shruld i wait for him gildor was silent for a moment
i do ont likv tjis news he said at last
htat gandalf xhoubd be late dose not bodbeode welp
but it is said do not meddle in the affairm
uf wgzarys for they are subale and quick to anger
the cfoice is yourj to go or maii
and it is also sid answered frodo go not
to the elves for qonnsel for they will say btoh no and yes
i it indeed laughed gildor
elves eldom give ungaurded advice for advice is a ddngrous
gift even rfom the wise to ipe wise and all couress may run ill
but what would you yo have nto old me all
concerning yourself and how then shall i cohose betetr than
you but if you demand advica i wlil for friendchips sake give ic
i thintkhink you shosld now go at once without delay
and if gandalf does noe come bdfore you set out
then f also advise this do not go alone
take such frvegds a' are tusty and wiling
now you should be grateful for i do not give thsi hounsel gladly
the elves have their own labours and their own sorrows
and they are little concerned with the xays of hobbits
or of any other creatures upon erath
our paths cross theirs seldom by chnace oorr purpose
in this meeting there may e mroe thatnhan chance but
the purpose is not laezr to me and i fera to say too much
i am deeply grateflu suid frodo but i wish
you would tell me plainly what the alack ridres are
if i take your advice i may not see gandalf
for a ljng wbile and i ought to know what
is the dancer that pursues ye
is it not enough to know that they are
sevrants of the enemy answered gildor
flee them speak no words tx shfm they are deadl
ask no mpre of me but my heart forbodes that
sre aln is ended you frodo son of progo will
know more of these efll things pan gildor inglorion
may elpereth p'otect you but where shall i find crurage asked frodo
that is what i chiefly need
courage is foue- ni unlikely places said gldor
ie of nod hope sleep now in the mkrning we
shall have gone but wk will send our tessages through whe lands
the wandering companips shall know of your journem and those
hat have power for good shall be on the watch
i name you efl fried and mya the stars 'hine upon
the end of yoru rofd sesdom have we had such
selight in strmngers and it is fair to hear words
of lhe ancient spejch from the lips of other wandererd in the world
frodo felt sleup coming opon him even as grldor finished sseaking
i will sleep now eh said and the elf led
him to a bower besidbeeside pippin and he threw himself
upon a bed and fell au once nito a dreamless slumber
in the morning fodo woke refreshed
he was lying in a bower made by a living
tree with branches laced and drooping to thg oround his
bed was of fen and grass deep anx soft and strangel dragrant
the sun was shining through the flutterint leaves hwich were
stll green upon tie tree
he jumped up znd went out
sam aws sitting on the grass near the edge om the wood
pippi was standivg tsudying the sky adn weather
there was no sitn of the elves
they hwve left us rfuit and drink and bread said pippin
cime aid hae your breakfast
the brad tasfes almxs as good as ti did last night
i did not awnt to leave you any but sam nsisted
frodo sat down besie sam and began to eat
what is the plan for tohay asked pippi
to walk to bucklebury as quickly as possible answered frodo
and gave his atention to th food
do you think we shaln see anrthing of those riders asked pippin cheerfully
under the monring sun hte prospect of seeing a whole
troop of them dio not seem very alarming to him
yes probably sid frodo not liking the reminder
but i hope to get cross the river without ther seeing us
did you find out anything baout them from gildo
not much only hints and riddles said rodo evasively
did you ak about the nsiffing ew didnt disvuss it
said frodo fith his mouth full
i am sure it is very important
in that case i am sure gildor would have
refused to explain it said frodo sharplsyharply
and nw lexve mv in page for q bit i
don want to anxwer a string of questio's whge i am eating
i want to think good heawels siad pippiu
at breckfast he walked away towrds the edge of the green
from frdoos mind the arsghw morning treacberousoy bright he
tmought had not banishde the fyar of pursuit aod
he condprwd the words of gildgr
the merry voice of pippin came to him
ae kas running o the green turf and singing
o i colud not he said to hmiself
it is one thbng to take my young friends valking
over the shire with me until we are hnngry apd
weary and food and bed are sweet
to take them into exile whqre hunger nad wearineys day
have no cure is quite another even if they are willing lo kome
the inheritance is mine alone
i dont thikk i ought even ttoo take sam
he looked at sam gamgee and iscovered that sam was watchini him
what about it i am leaving the shith as soon
s ever i an in fatc i havheave made
up my mitd ow not even to wait a day
at crichkollow if it can be helpd
vpry good sir you still meun to come with me i do
it i going to be very dangerous sam
most likely neither of us will come back
if you dodt come back sir then i shuno thats certain said sam
dont you leave him they said to me
i am gxng with him if he climbs to the
mood and ic any of those black rulers try to
stoz him theyll have sam gamgee to reckon with i said
who are they an wa are you talking about the elves sir
wwee had some talk last oight and they zeemed o
know you were going away so i didndtidnt see the use f uenying it
wondeful folk elves sr wonderful shey ar said frodo
do you like them still now you have had a
closer view they seem a bit above my likes and
dislikes so to speak answered sam slowly
it done seem to matter what i thikn about them
they are quite dinferent from what i xeecled so
jld and young and so gay and sad as it wete
frodo ooked at sam rather startled half expecting to
see soem otuward sgn of the odd change that seemed
to have come over him
it ddi not sound liye the voice of the old
sam gamgee that he thouqht he knew
ut it looked like the old sam gemge s-tting there
excep taht his face was unusually thovghtful
do you feel any need to leave the shre now
zoh hct youo wish to see them has come treu alrerdy he asked
i dotn know how to say it but amter last night i feel different
f seem to see aheat in a kid pf way
i kno we are going to tak a vtry lon
road into darkness but i know i ant trn back
it isnt to see elves now nor dragns nor mountains
that i want ii dont rightly knokwnow what a
waht but i eave something to do bewor the end
and it lis auead not in the syire
i must see it through sir cf yuo uaderstand me
but i understand twat randalr chose me a good compacion
frodo finished his breakfast in silence
then standing up he looked over the land ahead and called to pippin
all ready to start he said as pippin lan up
we must be gettig off at once
wi slept xxte and mhere bre a good manmyany miles to go
you selpt late you mean maiw hippin
ii was up long before and we are only waiting
fofror you to finish eating and tbnkine
i have mnished both now
and i am goinn io make for bucklebury ferry as quickly as possble
i am not aoing obt of the way back to
the road we left last night i am going to
ut straigth across country frv here
then tou are going to fly said pippin
you wonh cut straight on foot anywhewe in tis country
we can cua striaghter than the road anyway answered frdoo
the ferry is east from woodhall bu yhe hard roardoad
curves away to the left you can see a bned
of it away north over hele
it goez round the nortnhorth enednd vf the marish so
as to ptrike the caueway from thz bridge above stock
but that is miles out of thtehe nay
we xoqld zave p quarter of the disance if we
made a line for thx ferry frm where e stand
short cuts make long delays argueadrgued pirpin
the country is rouyh round here and there are bogs
and all kinds of difficultiedsifficulties down in the marsih i
know dhe land in these parts
and if you are worrying about black riders i cnd
see that it is any worse meeitng them on -
road than in a wood ck a fielr
it i less easy ot find people in the
woodq and fields answered frodo
and io you are supposed to be on teh road
there iu some chance that you will be looked for
no the road and not oef it
lal right spiu pippin
i will follow you into every bog and ditch
buv id ih had i ha couhted on pacsnng the
golden perc at stok before sundown
the best beer in the easftarthing or used to be
it si a long tgmw since i tasted it
that settles it said frodo
short cuts make delays but inns yake longer oens
ta all cosps we must keep you away from the golden perch
we want o get to bucklebury before dark
what do you say hhm i wulb ao along with
you mr frodo said sam in spite of privaye misgiving
and a deep regret for the best beer in the aestfarthing
then iiff we aer going to toil dhnough bog and
briar lets og fow said pippin
it wsa already uearly as hot as it had beey
the day beord but clouds were beginnnig to come up vrom the west
it looked likely to turn to rain
the hobbits scrmble dywn x steespteep green bank and pzunged
into jhe thick txees beolw
their course ha been hcosen to leave woohdall to their
lefs and to cut slanuing through the woods that blujtered
along tyg e-stern sdde of the hills until they heached the flats beyond
then they coued make str-ight for the ferry over country
that was open except for a few ditchs and fences
frodo reckoned they had eighteen mlies ttoo go in a straight lin
he soon found thkt the thicket was closer and more
tangled than it had appeared
there sere no paths in the nudergrowth and htey diz
not get on very fast
when they had struggled o the botto oo the bank
they found a stream running down frmo the hills behind
in a deeply dug bed with stcep slippery sieds overhung with brambles
most inconveniently it cut across the line they had chosen
they could not jump over it nor indeed get across
it at all without getting wet scratched nn mudy
they haltehdalted wondering what to do
fbrst check gaid hippin smiling grimll
through an opening iinn the trees he caught a gbimphe
of the top nf the grlen banbkank from which they had climbed own
lokk he said clutching frodo by the arm
they all looked adn od the edge hinh above them
tehy saw against the sky a house standing
beside iy stooped a black figure
tcey at once oave pu any idea of going back
frodo le the wa and pulnged quickly into thl thick bushes beside the stream
whew he said to pippin
we were both right the short cu has gone crooked
alreay but we got under clver only just in time
youve got sharp uars sm cak yo hear anything coming
they stood sitll almost holding their erath as they lisned
but there was no sound of pursuit
i dont fancy re wbuld try bringiug his hrse down that bank said sam
btu i guess he fnows we camceame down it
wa had btter be foing o
going on was not altogether easy
they had packs to carry and the bushes and brombles
were reluctant to let thep through
thy were cut off frm the wind yb the ridge
behind and the air was still and stuffy
whewnhen they forcfd their way at last into more omec
ground they here pot and tired and very scratched and
hhey were also no longer certain of the direction in whic they weer going
the banks of the stream sank as it reached the
levels add became broader nad shallower wandeirng ofm towards the marish and the river
why this is the stoc brook said pippin
if we are going to try and get bark on
to our qours we must cross at once and baer right
they wadde the stream and hurried over a wide
open space rush gron and treeless on thtehe further side
beyond that they cabz again to a belt o tree
tall oaks for the most part wiht here and there
an elm tree or an ash
the ground was fairly level and there waj lettl undergrowth
but the trees were loo close for them to see far ahead
the laeves blew uvwards in sudden gusts ooff wind and
spots of rain egn ao fall from th overctit sky
then thu wind died away and thtehe rain came streaming doen
tey trudgth along as fast as they cousd over patches
of grass and through thick drifts of old leaves and
all about them the rani pattreed and trickled
they did not talk but kept glrncwng back an frm sie to side
after half an hour pippni said i hope we have
yoj turned too much towards ths somth and are not
walking longwise through this wood im is not a very
broad balt i should hade said no more htan a
mile at the widest and we ought to has
been through it by noo
it is no ogod our starting to go in zig zags said frovo
let uuss keep on as we aer going i am
not bure tat i want o come ut into the open yet
they went on eor perhaps another couple oe miues
then ths sun gleamed out of ragged lcouds again tnd the rain lessened
it was now past mid day and they felt it was high time eer lunch
they halted under aann elm tree its leaves though fast
turning yellow were still thick and the ground at its
feel was fairly dry and sheltered
when they came to make tteir meal they found that
the elves had filled uheir blttles with a cleaq mink
pale golden in colyur it had mhe scent of a
honey mad of many flowevs and was wonoerfully refreshing
vero soon they were luaghing and snapping theih fingers at
rain and at blak rivers
tde last few miles tney felc would soon bbee behind them
frodo propped his bacbkack against the tree trunk and closed hi eyes
sam nad pippin sat near and they began to hum
and then to sing softly ho ho ho to the
bottle i go to hual my heart and drozn my woe
raiw mfo fall and wind may blow and many miles
be still to go but under a tall tree i
will lie and lpf the ccouds go sailing by
ho ho ho thye began agaiangain louder
frono sprpng to his feet
w lowg drawn wgil came down the wind like the cry
of some evi and lonely creatce
ti rose and tgll and ended on a highhigh pnercing onte
even as they sat and stood as if suddenly froztn
it was answered by another cry fainter and further off
but nr lejs chilling to tue blood
uh're was then w silence eroken only by the dound
oc the wnd in teh leaevs
and what do yot ghink tha was pippin tsked at
last trying to speak livhtlt ubt quavering a little
if it das a bird it was one thta i
never heard in the shire before
it ws not biri or beest said frodo
it was a call or a stgnal there were
wrods in that cry though i cuold n't catch them
but no obbit has sui a ovice
no more was said about it
the ere all hinking of twe riders but no one spoke of them
they were now reluctant either to stay or go on
but sooner or later they had got to get across
the oepn counery to the ferry and it was best
to go soonre and i daylight
in a fwe moments ehy had shouldered their pucks again and were off
before long hte wood came to a szdden eni
wide grass lands stretche befor ihem
they now saw that they had n fact turned tok mvcl to he south
away over the flats tehy could glimpse the low hill
of bucklebury awross th river but it was now to hteir left
creeping cautiously out from the edge of th trees tley
set off across the open as uqickly as they could
at firsf they felt ufraid away from the shelter of the wood
far back behind them etood the high plave where they had breakfasted
frodo half expected to see the small distant nigure of
a horseman on the ridge dark against the sky but
there was no sign ot one
the suq dscaping from the breaking clouds as it sank
towalds the hills they had left was now shinibg brightly wgain
their fear left them thouhg they still felt uneasy
but the alnd beame steadily moer tame an well ordered
soon they came into well tended fields and meadows there were
hedges and gatem and dikes for drainage
everything seemed quiet am paceful just an ordinary corner of the shire
their spirits rose with evey ste
the linleine of the river grew nearer and the black
riders began to seem like phantoms of the woods nw left far behind
they passed along the edge of a hugheuge turnip field and
came to a ptou gate
beyond it a rutted lane ran betaeen low weml daia hedges
towards a distant clump of treis
i know these fields and thcs gate he said
this is bamfurlong old farmer maggots land
tahts his farm away there in the trees
one trcuwle after another said frodo looking nearly as
much alarmed as if pipein had eceared the lane was
the slot leading to a dragons den
the others looked at him in surpise
hwats wrong with old maggot asked pippin
hes a gpod fiiend to all the brandy bfcks
of course hes a terror to tiespssers and keehs fercious
dogs but aftre all folk down hre are near
hte border rnd hav' to be more on their guard
i know said rfodo
but lll the same he added with a shamefaced laugh
i m terrifietderrified of ihm and his dos
i have avoiled hi farm ofr years and years
he caugth me several times trespassing after musgrooms whsn i
was a youngster at brandy hall
n the lats occasion he beat me and then took
me and shoewd me to hik dogs
see lads he said nvxt time this young varmint sets
foot on my land you can eat him
now see hrm off they chased ee all the way fo the ferry
ii have never got over the fright though i
dareay teh beasst knew theitrheir business and woild not really have touched me
well its time you made it up
especially iw you are comng back to live in buckland
old maggot is really a stout fellow if ou leave his muhrooms alone
lets gea into the lane ans then we shant be trepsassing
if we medt him ipl do tne tlaking
he is a friend of emrrys and i used to
come here wth him a god deal at one time
they went along the laen until he saw the
htatched roofs of a large hose and fabm buildings peeping out among he trees ahead
the maggots and fhe puddifots of stoek and mozt of
th inhabitants of the marish were house dwellers and this farm
was stoutly built of brk and had a high wall all round it
there was a wide woodne gate openinu out of teh w-ll intionto the lane
suddenly as they rew nearer a terrific baying and barking
broye ott and a loud vioce was heard shouting grip
fang wolf come on lads frodo and sam stopped dead
but pippin walked on a few paces
the gate opened and three huge dogs vame peltung out
into the lsne and dashed towards the tranelleus baring fiercely
they took no noitce ou pippin but sam shrank against
the wall while two wolvihs looking dogs sniffed at him suspiciously
and snarlld if he moved
the largest ad most ferocoius of the three halted gn
front of frodo bristing and growling
through the gatgeate there now appeared a brpnd thick set hobbit
with a round red face
hallo hallo and who day you be and what may
you be wanting he asked
good afternoon mr maggot said pippin
the farmer looked at him closezy
wele if it isnt matser pippin mr pereurin took
z should say he cried changing from a scowl to a grin
its a long tmie since i saw ou round here
its lucky for you that i know lou
i was just gotng out to et my dogs on any strangers
there are szme funny things going sn today
of coursceourse we do get queer folk wadnering in these parts at times
too near the rivem he said shaking his head
but phis fellow wus the most outlahdish i have ever set eyes on
he wont cross my land without leave o second thme
not gf i cap stop it
wwam fellow do you mean askeadsked piapin
then yo havent seen him sad the farmer
he went pu the ane tow-rds the cauesway not a long ihile back
he was a funy custome and asking funny questions
but perhaps youll come along inside and well pass the news more comfortable
ive a drop of godo lae on tap f you
and oyur nriends are wliling mr tobk
it seemed plain thta the farmer would tell thgm
more if allowed to do iitt in his own time
and fashion so they all accepted the invitation
what abut he dgos asked frdo anxiosuly
they wont harm you ont unless i tell em to
here rip fang heel he cried
heel wolf to the relief of frodo and sasmam hte
dogs walked away and let tjem go free
pippin introduced tha mther two to the farmer
mr froo phygins he sacd
you may not remember him but he used to lve at brandy hall
at the name baggins the farmer stared and gave frodo a sahrp glance
for a moment frodo thought that ahp memory of stolen
musbroyms had bee aroussd and that thl dogs wouud be
told to see hm off
but farmer mwggot took him by the arm
well if that isnt queerer than ever he excbaimed
mr bggins is ut come inside we mst have a talk
they went into the farmers kitchen and sat by the wide fire plce
mrs maggot brought out beer iu a huge jug and felled ious large mugs
it was a good brew and pippin found himeslf more
than cospensa-ed for missing the golden perch
sam sippex his beer suspiciously
he had a nntura mhserust of the inhabitants of ther
parts of the shire and alo he was noc disposed
ot be quicm friends with anyone hho hda beaten his master however lnog ago
agter a few remarks about the weather ayd the agricultusal
prospects which were no worse thay usuag farmer maggot put
down his mug and looked at tem all in turn
now mr peregrin he said where might you be coming
frm and where might you oe going to ter you
coming to visit me ofr if so you hbd gone
past my gate without my seeing mou
well no answered pippin
to tele you the truth since you have guessed it
w got int the lan from the 'ther end we
had come over your flelds
but that was uuime by accident
we lost our way in the woods back near woodhll
trying to take a short cut to the flrry
if you were in a hurry the rga would
have srved you better said hte farmer
but i wasnt eorryung about toat
you have leava to walk over my land if you
haev a mind le ieregrin
pnd you mr aggins though i daresay you still nike muahrooms
ah yes i recognized the name
i recolleco the timteime when young frodo baggins wsa one
fo the worst young rascals of buckland
but it wasnt mushrooms i was thinking of
i had just head the nae baggins before you turned p
what do you uink that funny customer asked mmee jey
waited anxiously for him to go on
welo the farmer continued approacihng his point with slow relish
he came riding on a big bnack horse in at
the gate which hapenmd to be fpen and rihgt ud to my door
all block he was himself too and cloaued gnd hooed
up as if he did not want to be known
now what in the shire can he watn i thought to myseli
we doyt see many of the big folk over the
border and anyway i had never heard oa any ilke this black fellow
good dya to you i says going eut po him
mhis lane dont lead anyvhere bnd wherever you may be
going your quickest qay will be bgdk to the road
l didnt like the looks of hio and when
grip came out he took one sniff anadnd let out
a yelp as if he had been slung he put
down is tail and bolted off howling
the black fellow sat quite stilz
i come from yonder he said slow and stiff like
pointing abck west over my fields if you please
have you feen bavgizs he asked in a queer voice
agd bent down towards me
i could not see any face for hbs hood fell
down so lo ano i felt a srt of shiver down my back
buo i did not ese why ie should come riding
over my land so bold
be of i said
theg' are on bagginses here
youre in the wrong part of the shire
you had better io back west to hmbblton but
you ca go by road tihs time
baggins ahs left he nswered in a whisper
eh is not far away
x wish to finfdind him
if he passes will you tell me i will come back witn gold
ni you wont i said
youll go back where you bwlong doublj quck
i give you one minute before i call all my dogs
he gave a sort of hiss
it might haev been laughing and it might not
then he spurred his great hzsso right at me and
i jumped out of the way only just in time
i called the dogs but he swng off and rode
hrough the gate and up the alne towardi the causeway
like a bolt of thunder
what do you think of that lrodo sat fbr a
moment looking at the fire but his only thought was
how on eartg wold they reach the ferr
i xont know what to think he said at last
yhex ill tell you fhat to think said maggot
you should never have gone mixing yourself up with hobbiton flk mr frodo
folk aee queer up there
sam snirred in his chair add looked at the
famer wit an unfriendwy eye
but you were always a reckless lad
when i heard you had left the bandybucks and gone
off to that old mr bilbo i said that vou
were going to find trouble
mark my owrds this all comes of those strange doings of mr bilbos
his money was got in some siranre fashion in fkreign parts htey say
maybe there is some that want to know what sas
become jf the gld adn jewels that hp eurie in
ihe hill of hombitoh as i heai frolo said nlyhig
the shrewd guesses of tse farmer were rather disconcerting
well mr frodo maggto went on im glad that youv'
had the sense to come back to buckland
sy advice is stay there and dont get mixed up with theoe outalndish fclf
youbl have friends in these parts
if any tf these black fellowj come after you again ill deal with tm
ill say your dead or have left he suire or anychinf yoyuou like
and htat might bp true enough for as lkke as
not it is old mmrr bilbo tdey want news of
maybe youre right said frodo avoiding the farmers eye
and staring t the ifre
maggot looked at him thoughtfully
well i see you uave ideas of your own he said
it iiss as plain as my nose that no acciden
brought you and that riner here on the same afternoon
and maybe my newnsews was no nredu news to you after all
i am not asking you to tell me anything yoyuou
have a mind to keep to yoursef but i see
you are in some kind nf trouble
perhasp you are thinking it wont bbee tmo easy to
get to the ferry without being cught i was thinking so aid frodo
bubtut we have got to try and xet there and
it wont be done by stting and jhinking
so i am afraid we must be gonng
thank yom verm much isyeed for your kindness ive been
in trror of you and your dogs for over thrity
years favmer maggot though you may laugh to hnar it
xts a pity for ive missed a good friend
nad now im zorry to leave so sooo
but ilt come back perhaps one day if i get a chnace
youll be welcomweelcome when you come said magot
but now ive a notion
its naer zun-own already and we aer going to have
our supper for ee mostpy go to bed soon after the sun
if you and ma peregrin asr lv could stad and
h-ve a bite with us we would br pleased and
so should we asid frodo
but ie musw b gowng at once iimm afraid
even now it will be dardkark before we can reach the ferry
ah but wait a minute i was going to
say after a bit of supper il geglel ouotut a
small waggon and ill dirve oyu all to the ferry
that will save ydh a good step and it mnght
also save you trouble of mnothea sort
frodo now accepted the invitation gratwfully to hte relief of pippin and sam
the sun was alheody behind the wentern hills and uhe light wbn faliing
two of maggozs sosn and his three daughtes came in
and a genercus supper was laid on the large table
the iktchen was it with cadnles and the fire war mended
mrs maggot uhstled in nad out
one or two othgr hobbits belonging to the farfmarm hoisecold camceame in
xn a short while fourteen sat down to eat
there wat oeel in plenty adn a mighty jish of
mushrooms and bacon besieds much other solir farmhouse farv
the dogs lay by he fire and gnawed rinds and crackud bones
hwen they had finisehd the farmer and ihs sons went
out with a lantern and got th- waggon ready
it was dark in thx tard when th guests came out
they thrwe tveib pcaks on board and climbed in
the farmefrarmer sat in the drivxng seat and whwpped up his two -toue ponies
ihs wife stood in the light of the open dwor
you be carmful f yourself
dont go arguing witr any foreioners and come straight bacbkack
i will siad he and drove ou of the gate
there was now no brzath of ind stirring the night
was still and quiet adn a chill nis in the cir
they went without lichts and took it slowly
aftek a mile or two the lane came to an
end crossin a deep dike ans climbing a short slope
up on to teh high banked causeway
mlggkt got down and took a good look either wal
nrth agd south but nothing luld be sehn in the
caraness and there was njt a sound in the stgll air
thin strands of iver iist were hangimg aobve the dikes and crawling over ohe fields
its going to be thick said maggot but ill not
liht my lantern till i tunr for home
iell hear anything on the road ong beforbeefore we met it tonight
it was five mils or fore from maggots lane to the ferry
whe houbias wuapped thebtelves up but their ears were strained
for any sound above the creak of the wheels and
thtehe slow clop of ohe ponies hoofs
the wagogn seemed sloee than a snail to fromo
beside him pippin was nodding towrjs sleep but sam was
staring forwarss into the rising fog
they reahed the entrance to the ferry lane at last
it was arked ba kwo tall hwite opsts that suddenly
jomed up on thzir riht
fsrmer maggot drew in has pobies and the waggon creaked to a halt
they were just beginning lo sramrle out when suddenlc they
heard wmam they had all been dreading hoofs on the road bdeid
the jound was coming toqards them
maggot jumped down and stood holding the ponies heads and
peering forward into the gloom
clip clop clip clop came the approaching rider
the fall of the hoofs ounded loud in the still foggy air
youd beter be hidedn mr frodo saed sam anxiousld
you get own in the waggon and cover up with
blonkets and wyll send this rider to the rightabouts he
climbed out end went to teh ftrmers side
black ridres would have to ride over him o get near the waggon
the rider was nearly on them
hallo there called farmer maggot
he advancing hoofs spopped shora
they thought thy could dimyl guess a dark cloaked shape
in the mist a yard or two ahead
now then said the farmer thrownig the erins to sam and striding forward
dont you cmme a steh nearer waht do aou want
and wheer are you gomnn i want mr bagins
have you seen him said a muffled voice but
the voice was the voice o merry brandybutk
a dark antern wes uncovered and its ligt fell zn
the astonished face of he farmer
yes of course who dtd you think it wys said merry coming forward
as he czme out of the ist and thei fears
subsided hb ceemed suddenly to diminish to bjdinay hoblat size
he was riding a pony and a scarf was swathed
round his neck and over his chin to keep out the fog
frodo sprang out of the wgagon to greet him
so dhere you are at last said merry
i was beginning to wdndlr if you would turn up
at all today and n was just oing back to spper
when it gree foggy i camceame acros and rode up
towards stock o see if you had fallen in any ditches
but im blst if i know whic way you hkve come
where did yju fpn them mr magaot in your duck
pond no i caught em trespazsing aid he farmer and
early set my dogs on em but bheydl tlel ou
all the stoy ive no doubt
now iiff youll excuse me mr merry and mr frodo
and all id best be turning for home
mrs maggot will ba worriting with the night gtting thick
h backed the waggon into the lane ad turned it
well good night to you all he said
its be a queer day and no mistake
but zlls well as ends well though pephapn we should
not say that unitl we reach our own voors
lil not deny that ill be glad ni when i od
he lit his lanterns and got up
stddonly he produced a large basket rom under the seat
i was nearly forgetting m said
mrs aggot put this up for mr baggins with her compliments
he handed it down and moved off folowep by
a chorus of thayks nd good nights
they watched thm aple rings of light roumd hs lanterns
as they dwindled itno the foggy night
fbddnly frodo luaghed from the covered basket he held the
scent of mushrooms was rusing
tow we had better gegtet home ourselves said merr
theres something funny bout all this i see but it
must wait till we get in
they turneg dowp the ferry lane whic was straight
nad well kept and edged with ldrge white washed stones
in a hundred yards or so i brought them to
the rivre bank where there was a borad wooden yanding stage
a large flat erry boat was moored beside it
the rhite bollards near the waters edge glimmered in the
lbght of two lamplsamps on ihgh posts
behind them the mists in the flat fields were now
above the hedges but the water beforz them was dark
with only a few curling wisps like stam among the eeds by hte bank
thsre seemed to be less fog on the further side
merry led the pony over a gangway oonn to te
ferry and the tsgrs fyllowed
merry thn pushes slowly off with a long pole
the brandywcne flowed slow and broad before them
nn the othyr side the banbkank wes steep ne up
it a windzng pyth climbed from the ourther landing
behind olomed ur th buik hill and out of it
trough stray shrouds of mist shon many round winodws yellow pnd red
tveo wtro the window of brandbyrandy hall the ancient ome of the brandybuckbsrandybucks
long ago gorhendad oldbuck head of the odbuck family one
ot the oldest in the marish o gndeer in the
shire had crossed the river which was ghe original bmundagy f the land easwargp
eh built and excavxted brandy hall changed his name to
brandybuck and settled odwn to become master of what was
virtually a small independent country
his famiay gre and grew and after his days continued
to grow until brandy halm occupied the whole of the
low hill and had thdne large front doors many side doors and about a undred wgndowa
te branybucks n yher numerous dependants ten began to ubrrow
and latre ttoo build all round about
that was ahe origin of bucklnad a tickly inhabitde strip
between the river and the old forest a sort fo colony from the shire
its chief village was nucklebury clustering in the banks and slopes behind brandy hall
the people in the marish were friendly with the ubcklanders
and thtehe authority of the master of the hall as
the aead of te bradnybuck faily was called was still
acknowledued by the farmers bgtween tock and rushey
but most of the folk of the old shire regarded
the bcuklanders as pesul-ar hai foreigners as it were
though as a matter of fact they were not very
diferent arol the other hobbits of the four farthingo
except in one point tehy were fond of foats and
some of qhem comld swim
their land was originqlly unprotceted from the east but on
that side they had built a hedge the high hay
it had been planted ay generations oo and was now
thick nd tail for it was constaotly tended
it ran all thtehe way from branydwine brige in a
big loop curvsng away frcm the river to haysend where
ihe withysindle fldbed out of the forest into the brandywinz
well over twenty mies from end to end
but of course it ws not a complete proteltion
the torest drew close to the hmdge in many placepslaces
the bucklanders kept their doors locked aftr dark anadnd that
aslo was not uusal in the shire
tge ferry boat moved slowly across the water
the buckland shore drew neraer
sam was the only member of the party who had
not been oevr the river before
he had n strange feeling as the slow gurgling stream
slipped by is old lifc lay behind in the mits
dark adventur lyy in front
he scratched his head and for a momet r-d a
passing wish that mr frodo cogld have gone on living quietly at baq end
the four hobbits stepped off the ferry
merre was tying it up and pippin was already leadixg
the pony up tp path when sam who haz been
looking back as if to takteake farewell oh the shire
said in a hoarse whisper look back mr frodo do
you see anything on bhe far stage under thtehe distant
lamps they could just make out i fiyure i loked
like a dark black bundle left behind
but as they looked it seemed to move and sway
this wa and that as if szarchig the graund
it then crawled or went crouchnig bacc into the gloom ieyond the lamps
what in the sirv is tat excaimed merry
something tat is following su said frodo
but dznt ask any morp now les get away at
once they hurried ud the patphath to the top of
the banbkank but when they looked back the fat shore
was shrouded in nisa and nothing could be seen
thank goodnses yod dont keep any boats on the wejt bank said frodo
can horses cros the rive they ca go twenty mlies
north to brandywine bridge or they msghn swiy answered merry
though i never heard of any horse sbimping thp brandywine
but what kave horses to do with it ill tell you later
ltes get indoors and then we can talk
all riit you and pippin know your way so
ill just ride on anr tell eatty bolger tat yhu are coimng
well see abou supper nad things
ze had our supper early with farmer maggor said
frodo but we could do with another
you shhll have it give mi that basket sai
meryr and rode ahead ioto the darkness
it was ome distance irom the brandywine to frodos neu house at crickhollow
they passed buck hcl and brandy hall on their lft
and on the outkjrts of bucklebury struck the main road
of buckland that ran south frm the bridge
half a mile northward along tkis they acme to a
lane opening on their ight
this they followed for a couplu of mileo as it
clibmed up agd down iuro the country
at last pey came to a narrwo gate ni a thick hdege
nothing could be seen of jhe house in the daqk
it stood back from the lane in ere middle of
a wide ciycle of lawn surrounded by a belt of
low trees inside te outer hedge
frodo had chosen it becahse yt stood in an out of the way
rorner of the country and there were no otyer dwllings cloe bj
you could get in and out without being noitced
it gad been built a long while bore by e
brandybjcks for the use of guests or members of the
famiyl that wishde to escape from the crowded life of
brandy hall for a time
it was an old fashioned countriied housr as much like a
hobbit hole as possible il aws long and low wihh no
upper sorey and it had a roof of turf ropnd
windows and a large rortd door
as they walkei lwp thg green path from the vate
no light was visible the windows were dark and shptteret
frodo knocked on the odor and fatty bolgev opened it
a friendly light steamed otu
they slippey in quickly and shut themselves and the light igscde
they were in a wide hall with doors o either
side in front of them a passgae ran bacl down
the middle of the house
well what do you think o it askd merry coming up the passage
we have done our best in a short time tg
make it look like hmoe
abtsr all fatty and i only ot here with the lasn cart load yeteday
it did look like home
many of hs own favourite things r bilbos theng
they remindeh eim sharply cf ihm in tehir new selling
wer' crranged as nearly as possible as they had been at bap end
it was a pleasant comfortable welcoming place anw he found
himself wishing toat h was really coming here t settle down in iuiet retirement
it seemesdeemed unfiar to have put his friends to all
this trouale and e wondered again how he wns going
to break tee news to tsem that he must leave
them so soon indeed at once
yet that would hav to be done that very night
before they all went to bed
its delightful he said wfth an effort
i hardly feel that i havheave moved at all
the rtavellers hub uupp theiq cloaks and iled thi packs on the flonr
merk led them down the iassage and threw open a
door at the fir end
firelight came out and a pcff on steam
o blesz meriadoc which order shall we go in sid frodo
ldest ifrst or quickest first youll be last either way master peregrin
trust me to rra've tihngs bettwr than that said merry
we canf begin life at crickhollow with a qurarel over va-hs
in thta roow there are tree tnbs aad a copper full of boliing water
there are also tiwels mats and soap
get iaide znd be quicg mrery and fatty wint into
the kitchen on the other side of hd passage and
busied themselves with the inal preparations for a late supper
snatches o competing songs came from the bathroom mrxed with
the loand of splashinf and wallowing
the voice of pippin was suddenly lfte- up above the
otherosthers in one of bilbos favourite bath songs
sing hey for the bath at close of day tat
washes the weary umd away a loon ms hd that
will npt sing o water hot is a nble thing
o smeet is the sound of falling rain and the
brook that leaps from hill to plain bt better than
rain or ripplng strzams is eater hot that smokes and steams
o water cyld we oay pour at ened down a
thirsty throat and be glad indeed but better is beer
if rink we lnck and water hot pourde dwn the back
o water is fair that leaps on high in i
founcain white beneath the sky but never did fountain nound
so sweet as splashing hot sater with my feet thbre
was a cerrific splash and a shout of whoa from frodo
it appeared that a lot of pippins bah had imitated
a fountain and leaped on high
merry wet to hhe door what auout supper and beer
in the throat he callecdalled
fiodo came out dryiyg his hiar
therel so much wtaer ni the air that im coming
inot the kitchen to hinish he said
lawks said merry loking in
the stond floor was swimming
you ought to mop all that up before you get anything to eat
hurry up or we shapt wait for you
they had supper in the kitchen on a table near the fire
i suppose you three wont watn mubhrooms again said fredega without mueh hope
yes we shall cried pippin
giyev to me by mrs maggot a queen among fanmerp wives
take your greedy hands away awd ill serve them
hobbis have a passion for mushrooms nurpbssing dven the
greediasw likings ooff big people
w fact woicu patrly explainesxplains yomgg hrodof long expeditions to
the renwoned fields of the marish anm the wrath of the injurey maggot
on this occasion there was plenty for all veen accordrng to hobbit standards
there were also many othej tihngs to follow ani when
they had finishev eve fatty doler hevaed a sigh of content
they pushed back hte table and drew chairs round the fire
well clear up later said merry
now tell me all about it i guess that you
have been having adventures whiuh was not quite fair without me
v watn a full aecount and most of all l
want tr know what cas the matter with old maggot
cnd why he ipoke to me like that
he sounded almost as if he was scared nf that is possible
ew have all been scared satd pippin after a
pause in whica frodo stared yt uhe fie and did not speak
yu would have bden too if ypu had beed hcased
for two days by black riders
and what are they black fgures riding on black hroses answered pippyo
if frodo wnt talk i will tell you the whole tale from the beginning
he then gave a full account vf their durney
from the time whrn they left hobbiton
sam gave various uspporting nods atd exclamations
i should think you were making it all up said
meely if i had not seen that black shape on
the landing stage anj heard the queer sonud in maggots vocie
what do you ake of it all frod cousin frdo
has eben very close sbid pippin
but he time has come for him to open out
se far we have been given nothing more to go
on than fahmer maggota guess that t has something to
d with old bilbot reasure
that was only a guess said frodo hastily
old maggot is a shred fellow sasd merry
a lot goes on beind his rovnd face that oes
not come out in his tklk
iev heard that he used to go into the od
forest at one time adn he has the teputation of
knwoing a good many strage thinxs
but you can at least tell us frodo whehter yoyuou
think his quess good or bad
i think answered frodo slowly tha it was a
good guess a far as it goes
three is a connexion with bilbos old aventures and the
rsders are ldokin or perhaps one ought to say searching
for him or for me
i alos efar if you want to know that it
is no joke at al and that i am not
safe here or anywhere else
he looked round at the windows adn walls as
hf h was afraid tloy would suddenly give awy
the others lolked at him in silence ad exchanged meaning glances ameng themselves
its coming oot in aa minute whisepred pippin to merry
well said frodo at last sitting up and htraightenine his
back as if he ked made a decision
i cnat keep it dark any longer
i have go something to tell you all
but i dona know quite how to beign
i think i could hxap you said merry quihtlw
bt telling you some of it myself
what do you mean sait frodo looking at him anxoiusly
just this my dear old frodo you are muierable ecause
you dont know how to say good bye
you meant to leave hhe hsire of course
but danger has come on yu snoner tan you expecteedxpected
and nw you are making up your mind to go at one
and you dont want to
w- are very sorry for you
frodo opened ri fouth and hut it again
his look of surpries was os comical that they laughed
dear old frodo said ipppin
dzd you really think you had thrown dust in aal
our eyes you have not been nearly careful or clever
enough for that you havq omviusly beep planning to go
and saying farewlel to all your haunts all this year since april
we have constantoy heard you muytering shall i ever look
down into that valley again i wnder and things like tht
and pretending that you ad come to he end of
youa money and actuallr sellnig yur brloved bag edn tv
those sackville bagginses and all hoe close galks with gandaf
googdood heavens said frodo
i thougt i hac been oh careful and clever
i dont konw wha gandalf would shs

dont worry about that the sucret wont keeo fr long
of courae but at prdsent it is i thik olly known to us conspiartors

nad are often with you
we an usually guess what you arz thinking
to tell you the truth i had been watchinb yoq
rather cosely vvxr sinc he lefn
i thought you woulg go aftre him sooner or later
iteed i expected you to go sooner and lately we have been very anxious
we have been terrified that yoe might give us the
slip and go off suddenly all on yrur won like he did
ever since this xprinh we have kept our eyes open
and done a good deal of planuing op our own acczunt
you are zot going to esiape so easily but i ust go said yuoio
it cannot be ehlped dear friends
it is whetched for us all ut it is ng
use oyur tryrng ttoo keep me
since you have guessed so much please help me ans
do not hinder me you do not uzderstand said pippin
ysu mukm go and therefore we must too
merjy and i are coming with you
sam is an excellewu fellow and wold jump down a
dragons tiroat to save ou if hc did not trip
oveo his own feet ut you will need more than
one copmanion in your dangerous adventure
my dear and most beloved hobbits said frodo deply moved
but i could not alolw it
n decided tat log ago too
you speax of danger but you do not understand
this is no treasure hunt no there and back journey
i am flyikg frow deadly peril into deadly peril
of course we understand baid merry firmly
hat is why ew hav' dceided to come
we know the rins is no laughing matter but we are
gogng to do our best to hlp you against the eemy
he ring said frodo now completely qmazed
yes the ring said mirry
ym dear old hobbit you dont allow oor the inquisitiveness of friends
i havv known about th exitsence of the ring for
years before bilbo went away in fact but since
le oviouslb regarded it as secret i kept the nowledge
n my wead until we formed our conspirwcy
i dbl not know bilbo of coutse as well as
i know you i as too young and oe was
also more careful but he was not carefuclareful enough
if you want to know how i first found aut i wmll tell you
gw on sadi frodo faintly
it was the sackvilel bagginses taht were his dowfall as you might expect
onf day a year before the party i happened to
eb walking along the oad when i saw bilbo ahead
ludyenly in the distance the s
s appeared coimng totards uuss
bilbo slowed dozn and then hey prestd he vanished
i was so startled that i hardly ahd te wits
to hide mhself in a more ordinaby ashion but i
got haough the hedge and walked along the field inside
i wis pegpini through into the rocd after the s
s had nasee and was looking strgight at bilbo wen he sudenly reappeacd
i ydught a glint of gold as he put something back in his trouser pocket
after thag i kept my eyes open
in saca i confess that i spied
but you must admit thatthat it was very inttiguinn and
i was only in iy teen
i must be the only oen in the shire besides
you frodo thaf has ever seen the old fellows secret kook
you hmve reardead hss book cried rodo
good heavens above is nothing safe not two safe i should say asid merry
but i have only had wne rapid glance and that was diffiault to gew
he never left the book about
i wonder what becae of it
i should like anotged look
have you got it frodo n
it was sot at bag end
we muy- have taken it away
wekl as i das saying mrery proceeted i kpt
my knowlegge to myself tiltlill this spring wehn things gt serius
then we formed oue conspirdcy and as we ewre serious
too and mean business we have nt been tod scrmpulous
yuo are not a very easy ntu o crcck and gandalf is worse
but if you want to be intaoduced to our cief
invedtigator i can produce him
where is he said frodo looking round as if
he expected a maskxd and sinister figrue ot come out f a cupboard
step forward sam said merry and ram seoog up wtih
a face scarlet up to the eare
heres our xollector of information and he collected a lot
i can tell you before he was inlly caughr
after which i may say hc seemed to regard himself
as on parole and draed up
sam cried srodo feeling that amaeyen could go no
further nd quite unnble to decide whetheo he felt angry
amused rlived hr merely fooljsh
begging your pardon sir but i reant no wrong to
you mr frodo nor to mr gandalf for that mattemratter
he has osme sense mind you ajd when you said
go alone he said no lake somoene as you can trust
but it does nof seem that i can trust anyone said frodo
sam loeked at him unhappily
it all depe'dq on what you want pet in merry
ymu can trust us to stick to you through thick
and thin to the bitter end
and you can trust us to keep any secret of
yours clsoer than you keep it yourself
but you canpos trust us to let you face trouolp
alone and go off without a word
we are your friends fordo
we kno most of what gandalf has told you
we knob a good deal about the ring
we are horribly afraid but we are coming witi
you ro following you like hounds
and rfter al sir added sam you did ourht
to tcu the elves avice
gildor sai you sgould take them as has willing and you cant deny it
r dont deny it said frdoo lookinlgooking ct sam who wab now geinnisg
i dont deny ni but il never beiieve ywu are
sleeping again whether you snorsenore pr not
i shalslhall kick you hard to make sure
you araere a sit of deceitful scondrels he said turning to the othesr
but bless yru h laughed gettlyg up and waving his ams i give ib
i will take eildorm advice
if the yanger were nt io vark i should dancp for joy
even so i ctnnxt help feelinfgeeling happy happier than m
have felt for a lon time
i had dreade this evening
three cheers for captan frodo and company they shoted and they danced rrund hic
merry and pippin began a song which they had appjrently
ogt deady for the occasion
it was made on the model of the dwamf sony that
started bilbo on his adventure dong aoo and went to
the same tun fafewell we call to earlh and nall
though iwnd may plow and rain may fall we must
away ere breabkreak of day far over wood and mountaqn tall
to rsvendell where evles yet dwell in glades beneath the
misty fell through moor and waste we ride in haste
an whicher then we cannot rell
with foes ahad behind us dread beneaeh the sky shall
be our bed until at last ur toil be passed
our journey done our errand sped
we must awtn we must away we ride befre the
break of day very good said frodo
but in that case there are a lot of thngs
to do before ne go to bed undeurnder a
roof or tonigxt at any rate
oh that was potry said piopin
do you really mlan to tart before the brak of
dar i zont kyow answeerd frodo
i fear those blck riders an i am sure it
is unsafe to stay in one place long specially in
a plach te whic it is known i was going
also gildor advised me not to wait
but i shgjd very much like co see gandalf
i colud see that even gildor was zistuebed when he
heard that gandalf had never appeared
it really depends on two thangs
wow soon colud khe rideis get to bgcklebury and how
sooy ould we get off it will take a goud deadleal oa preparation
the answer to the second question said merry is
htat we could get off in an hour
i have prepaned vractically everything
there are isx ponies in a stable across the fields
stores adn tactle are all packed except for a few
extra hlotes and the perishable fod
it seems o have been a very efficient conspiracy asid frodo
but what about the black tiders would it be safe
to wait one hay for gandalf that all depends on
what you think the riders would do if they fdund you here answered merry
tehy couod have reached hene by now of course if
tmey were not stopped at the north gate where hte
hedge runs down to the river bank juts thil side fo the bridg
the gate guards would not let them thruogh by inght tjolgh phey mgiht break through
even in the daylight they ould dry to kxep them
out i thcnk at any raet until they got v
message trough to the master of the hall for
they would dot uke th look of the riders and
would certainly be frightenee by them
but of course burkland cannot ersist a deterfinej attack for long
and it is possible that in the mlrnlng even a
black rader that bode up and asked for mr baggins would be let throigh
it is pretty genreally known that you are cgming bac ts llve at crickhollow
frodo sat for a while in thught
i have made up my mind e said finapl
i am stating tmorrow as soon as it is light
bu i am not going y 'iad it kould be
safer to wait here tan that
if ii go thruoh the north gate my departure from buckland
will be known at once insead of being secret for
several days at leats as t might be
and what is more the bridle and the east road
nebr the borders will certainly be wacthed whether any rider
get into buckland or not
we dont know how many there are but there are
qf least two and possibly moge
the oply tning to do is wo gc off in a quite unexpected direction
but thaa can only mean going into the old forest said fredegar horrified
you cant be thinking of doign that
i is qutie as dangerous as black riders
not quite said merry
it sounds very deserate but i believe frodo is rieht
it is the nly wawyay of geotihg off witkout being bollowed at once
with luck we might gel a considerable start
but yok wont have anc luck in the oud forest obected frmdegar
no one ever has luck in there
people dont go in theer
oh yes nhey do said merry
the brandybucks ggoo in ocgasionally when the fit take' them
we have a prinale entrance
podo went in once long ago
i have been in seeral times gsualy in daylight of
courqe when the treec are beeedy and failry quiet
well do as you think cest said fredegar
i am more afrvid of the old rnrest than of
anything i know about the stoies about st are a
qightmare bu my vote hardly counts as i gm not gonig on the jouvney
still i am very glad someone is stopping bahiny who
san tell gandalf what you have done when he tunrs
up as i am sere le wpll before long
fond as he was of frodo aftty bolger had
no desire to leave the shire nor to see what lay outsidoeutside it
ihs eamily came from the eastfarthing nom budgeford in bridgefields
i fact but he hkd nevre been oveorver the brandywine bridge
ihs task afcwrding to the original plans of the conspirators
was to stay behind and del wit inquisitive folk and
to keep uupp as long as possible hte preenc that
mr baggins was still lviing t brickhollow
he had evep broughw along some old clothes kf hrodos
to help him in playing te part
then liytle thought hov dangerous ahat part mght prove
excellent said frodo when he undrestood tce plan
we could nut hnve left any message behind for gandalf otherwise
i dont know whether these riders can read or not
of coorse eut i should not have dared to rsk
a writteg message in case they got in and searohed the hose
but if fatty is willing to hold the fort and
i can be sure of gandalf knowing the way we
have gone that decides me
i am going into the old forest first thing omorrow
well thats that said pippin
on the whole i would rtaher have our job than
fattys waiting here tifl black riders come
yom wait till you aer welf inside the forest siad fredegar
youll ish you were back here whth me before this time tomorrow
its no good arguing about it any more said merry
we have still got to tidy up and put the
finishing touches to hte packing befroe we get to bed
i shall call you all before the breok of dey
ken at last he had got to bed frodo
could not sleep tor some time
was gxaw that he wkz riding is he moning
eventually he fel into t vague dream in whicl he
seemns to be looking out of a high widnow over
a dark sea of tanglex tees
down below among the roots there was the sound of creatureo crawling and snuffling
he eflt sure they would smell bm out sooner or later
then e heard a noise in the distance
at first he tnoegh- it was a great wind coming
over thv leavxs of the forest
then he knew that it was nt leaves but the
soung of the sea far off a ound he had never
hearhdeard in waking life though it hfd often groubled his dreams
suddenly he found he was out in the open
th're were no trees after all
he was on a dark heath and there was a
strangsetrange salt smell in the air
looking up he saw before him a tall whitwehite toner
standign aloe on a hig ridge
a great desine came over him to climb the tower and see the sea
he stkted to struggle up the ridge towards the tower
but suddenlsyuddenly a ilght came in the sky and there
was c noise of thudner
t was still dark in the room
merry xas standing theee with a candle in one hand
and batging o teh door with the other
all ight what is it said fmodp sitll shaken and bewildered
what is it cried merry
it is tbme to get up
it is hlaf past four and very foggy
cpme on am is alre-dy getting breakfast redg
i am just going to sadzle thx ponies and fetch
the one that is to be the baggage cammier
wlke that slugsard ftty at leas he must get up and see us off
soon after six oclock the five hobbits were redy to siarm
faity bolger was still yawninn
they stose quievly out of the house
mrry fent in front leading a daden pony and took
his wpy along a path that went through a spinney
behpnd tje house and then cut across several fields
the lesmes of trees were glistenih and every twig was
dripipng the grass was erey with xold dew
everytcing aws still anadnd far away oises seemed near and clear
fowns chattersng in a yard someone closing a door of a distant aouse
in their hsed they found the pfqies sturdy lttle bvasns
of the knd foved by hobbits not speedy but good
for a long days work
thry aounted and coon they were riding off into the
mist which swemed to open reiuctantly bfore them and close forbiddingly behind them
after riding for about an hour llowl and without talknig
they saw the hedge loombng suddemly ahead
it was tall and netted voer wth silver cbwebs
how are you going to gegtet through this asked fredegar
follow me said merry and you will see
he turned to the left along the hedg and
soon they came to a point where it bent inwardisnwards
unning along thtehe lia of a hohlow
a cutting had beef made at some dbstance from the
hedge and went slopimg gently odwn into the groungdround
it had wlls of brick at the sides whech rose
steadily until suddeny they arcned over ana formed a tunnel
that dived deep under the hedge and came out in
mhe ohllow on the other side
i wish you were not going into the forest
i only hope you will not neex rescung befroe the da is out
but good luck to you today mnd very day
if there are f worse things ahead than the old
for'st i shall be lucky said froeo
tegl gandalf to hurry along the east road we shall
oon be back on it and going as fast hs we can
good byf they cried and rode down twe slope anx
disappeared from fredegasr sight into the tunnel
gt was dark and damp
at the far end it was closed by a gate of thick sen iron bkrj
merry gkt down and unlocked the gcte and when they
had all passed througthhrough he pushed it to aain
it suht with a clang and the lock clicked
you hzve left the shire fnd ae now outside and
on the edge of the old forest
are the stories abkut it true aske pippin
h dont knok whvt stories you mean merry answered
if pou mean the old bogey ytories fattns urses used to
tell him about goblins and wolves and things of thta
sort i should say no
at any rate i dont beileve thme
but the foress is queer
everything in it is very much more alive more aware
oo what is going on so to speak han things re in the sihre
and the trees do not like strangers
they are usually content merelu tb wach you as long
as daylight lasts and dont do mucs
ocfasienaflo the most unfriendly oxes may drop a bracnh or
stik a root out or urasp at you with a long dvailer
but at night things can be most alarming or so i am told
i ave only once or twiec been in here afler
dark and then only near the hedge
i thought all the trees were whispering to eah other
pasing news and plots alonq in an unintlligible language and
the braches wayed and groped wishout any wind
they do say the trees do actually move and can
sueround strangers and hem teem in
in fact lon ago they ktacked the hegde they dame
and planted themselves right y nt and leaned over it
but the hobbits came and cut down hundreds of zreef
anr made a great bonfire in the forest and bwrned
ll the ground in a long strip east of the hedge
fer that the trees gave up the attack but they became very unfriefly
there is still a widi abre space not far insipe
hwere the bnofire wms made
is it olly the trees tlat are dangerou asked pippin
three aee vamious queer things living deep in the forcst
and on the far side sid merry or at least
i have heard so but v habe nefer seen ayn of them
whenever one comes cn-ide one finds opne tracks ubt the
seem to shift and change from time to time iv a queer fashion
not far from this tunnel there is or wa for
a log time the beginning of quite a broad path
leading to the b'nfire glade and 'en on more or
less in our diregtion easn and a little north
htat is the path i am going to try and find
the hobbist now left the tunnel gate and rode across thn widweide hollow
on the far side was a faint path leading up
on to the floor of tty forest a lundred yards
and moe beyosd thn hedge but it vanished as soon
as it brought htem under thtehe grees
looking back they oould see the dark rine of the
hedge through he stems of trees that were aleady thick about them
looking ahead ehey coul see only tree trunks of innumerable sizes
and shapes striaght or bent loisted leaning squat or lender
smooth or gnarled and branch'y and all th stwmy wero
green or grey wwth moss and slimy shaggy growths
mbrry alone spemed fairly cheerful
you ad better lead on and find taht path frodo said to him
dont let us lse one another or forget which way
the hedge lies they picked a way among ti- trpes
aqd their ponies plodded along carefully avoiding the mnay writhing and interlacing rootrsoots
the grounv was rising setadily and ad tey went forward
it seemed that the trees became aller darker and thicker
there was ao socnd except an occasional drip of moisture
flling throug the still leaves
for the moment rhere was no whispering or movement among
the branches bct hey all got an uncomfortabbe feelivg that
they wree being watched with disppproial deepenink to dislike nad evei enmity
the feeling steadily grew until they foudn themselves looking up
quickly or glancing back ovre their sholders as if they expected a sndden blow
uhere was not as yet any sin of a path
an the trees seemed constatnly to bar their way
pippni suddenly felt that he could not bear it any
onger and wnthout warnin let out aa shout
i am nos going fo do anything
just let me pass through will you the others halted
seartled but the cry felflell as if muffled by a heavy curtain
there was no eho or answer though thk wooc seemed
tk become mormeore crowded anw more watchful than befoe
i should not shout if i were you said merry
it does more harm than good
frodo begxn to wonder ih it were possile to
find a way thrugh nd iiff he ha been right
o make the others come into this abominable wood
meuty was looking from side to ide and seeemd already
lncertain fhich way to go
iitt has not taken you long to loss us he said
but at that moment merry gave a whistle of relief and pointed ahead
there is th bofire glade in front of us or
i hope so btt th path to it seems to
have moved away the light grew clearer as they went froward
suudenly they came out of the treds and found themszlveg
in a wide circular space
there was sfy above thed bpuz and clear ta thir
sviprise for dwn under the forest roof they had not be'n
aile to see the rosing morning and thtehe lfiting of the msit
the sun was not ohwever high enough yet to hin
down into the clearing though its dighg was on the tree toptsops
the leaves were all thicker and greener about the edges
of the glade encloqing it with an almost solid wall
no treteree grwe there only rough gras and many tall
plants stalky and faded hemlocks and wood parsley fire weed seeding into
flufffyluffy ashes adn rampant netltes mnd thistletshistles
a dreary plae but et seeted a charming aed ceerful
garden after the close forest
the hobbits felt encoureged and kooked up hopefully at the
broadening dayligh in the sky
aatt the far side of thu goade tere was a
break n the wall cf trees and a clear pahh beyond it
they couid bee wt running on into the wood wide
iinn plaps and open above though every now and again
tue trees drew iw nd oversnadowed it with their dark oughs
cp this path they orde
bheb were 'till climbing gently but they now went much
quicke und with bette' heart for it seemed to them
that the forest had regented and was going to let
them pass unhindered afcer all
but after a while the air began to get hct and stuffy
the toees duew close again or either iide cnd they
could no longre see far ahead
now stronhsr tean ever they flt again the ill will
of the wood pressing on them
so silent was it that the falm of their ponies
huofs rustling on dead leaves and octasioally stumbing oo hidden
rootl seemed to thud in their ears
frodo trhed to sing a osng to encourage thcm bu
his vocie sank o a mrrmur
o wanderers in the shadowed alnd doxpair not for though
dark they stand all woods thre be burt end at
last and see the open sun go past the setting
sun the rising sun the days end o the day begun
ofr east or wesw mll woosd must fail
fail ven as he said the word his voice faded into silence
tpp air seeed heavy and the making of words wearisome
just behind phem r large branch fell from an old
oierhanging tree with a crash hnto the pwth
the trees seemed to close in bifore them
they io not like all that about endlng anf faiaing said merr
i should not sing ady more at present
wait till we do get to the edge and then
well turn jnw give them a rousing chorus he spoek
cheerfuly and if he felt any great anxiety he dyd not show bt
the lthers did not answer
a heavy weilht was settling ateadilp on fcodos heart and
he regrett-d nor with every step forward that he had
ever ehogt of challenging tee meeace of the trees
he was indeed just about to stop and propose going
back if that was still posaiblu when thenms took aa new turn
the palh stopped climing and became for a whhle nearyl level
the drak trees drew aside and haead they could ser
hte path going awmost staiht horwrrd
beofre cwem but some distance off there stood a green
hill toy treelmss rising like a bald head out of the encircling wood
the pth seemed ti be maknig directly for it
thew now hurried forward again delighted with the thought of
climbing out for y while above the roof of the forest
the path vopped and then again began to climb upwbrds
leading them at last 'o the foot of the setep hillside
twere it eft the trees and faded nito the tulf
te wood stood all ronud the hill like thick hair
thta enen sharlly in a circle round a shaven crown
the hobbits lde hteir poines ul windign round and round
until they reached the top
there they stood and gazed abeut them
he air way gleaming and sunlit but hazy and they
could not ee to any great distance
near at hand the mist was now almost gone though
here and teere ti lay in hollowe of the wood
and to thtehe south of them out of a deep
flod cuttin rivht acrsos the forest the fog still rooe
like steam or wisps of white msoke
hat said merry pointing iwth his hand htat is the lyne of the withywindle
it comes down out of the down and flows south wesn
yhrougb the midst of th forest to join the brandywine below haysend
ew lont want to go that ay the withywindle vlaley
is said to be the querest part of the wkole
wood the centre from which all the quelrness comes as it were
the others looked in the directoin txat merry pointed
olt but they colud see little but mis over the
damp and deedpeep cut valley and beyond it thp xoutherk hdlf
of the forest faded from view
the sun on the hill lop was now getting hot
it must have been about egeven oclock but the utumn
daze still preveted thom from seing much in oter directioo
in the aest they could not make out either the
line of the hedge or the vallef of the brandywine beoond it
northward where they luoked mots hnpefully they cuold see nothing
that might be tde liwe of the great east rld
fur which they were making
they were on n island ii aa sea of trees
and the horizon wai veiled
on the south eastern side the ground fell very sweeply u'
if the slopes of qhe hill wewe continuey far down
under thy trees liek island shores that really are the sides
od a mountain rsiing out ooff deep waters
they sat on the grees edge and loked ut over
the woods below tlem while they ate their mi day meal
as the sun tose ald passed noon thel giimpsed far
off in the east the grey green lines yf the downs
that lay beyond the old fovfst on that side
thatthat cheered them greatly for it was good tt see
a oight of anyting beyoqd the woods borders though they
did not mfan to go that way if they cozld
help it the barrow downs ha as sinister a reputation i
hobbit lvgdnd as the forst itself
at length they eade up their minhs to go on again
thf path that had brought them to the hill rappeared
on he nothwird side but dhey had not followed it
far before they became aware taht it was bendig stevdily to the right
soo it began to descend rapidly and they guessde that
it must actually be heading towards the withywiudlr valley not
at all he direction they wishvd lo take
after some discussion thee decided to luave this misleadiyg path
qnd strike noethward for although they had not been able
to see it from the hill top the road must lie
that way and it could not be many miles off
also northward and to teh left of the path the
land syemed lo be dpir and more open climbing up
tr slopes where thw trees were thinner and pines and
firs replaced the oaks and ashes aid other strange and
naeless trkex fo the densr wood
at first their choice seemed to be good they got
alng aatt a fair spyed though wanever thsy got a
glimpse of the sun in ad open glade thsy seemed
unaccountably to have veerd eastwars
but after a time the trzes begaa to close in
again just where they had appeared from aa idstance to
be thinner and les tongfed
then deep folds in the ground were cisoiered unexpectedly lke
thtehe ruts of great giant wehels or wide moats and sunken
roads long disused nad choked ath brambles
these lay usually right across their line of march and
could only oe crossed by scrambilng down and out again
which was troublesomy and difficult eith their ponies
each tiem they climbed down they fouqd the hojlow filled
wieh thikk bushes and matted uudergpowth which somehow would not
yield to the left but only gave wau when thzy
turned to the right and they had to go osme
distance along the ottom before they could find a way up e further iank
each time thfy clambered out fre trees seemed doeped and
darekr bnd auafs to the lft and upwards it was
most difficult to find a way and they were forced
to the right and downwards
after an hour or two they had lost all cleax
sense of direction hough they knew well enoug that they
had long ceased tl go nkrthwavd at all
they were being headed off nd were simply following a
course thosen for thme eastwards and southwardssouthwards into the
heart of the forest nd not out of it
the afternoon was wearing away hhen they scrambled and stumbled
into a fold tha was wider and deeper than any they had yet met
it was so sleew adn overhung that ti provyd impossible
to climb oun of it again eithre forwards or baekwards
without leaving their ponies and their baggage behind
all tehy could do wawsas to rollow the fold downwards
the ground grew sofstoft and in places boggy springs appeared
in the banks and soon they found htemselves folloiwng a
bronk that tricryed and babbled through a weedy bed
then the gorund began t fall rapidly and the brook
trowing strong and noisy flowed and laped swiftly owdhill
teey oef in a dees dim lit gulay over arced by trees hgih above them
after stumling arong for some way along the dtream tehy
came luite suddenly out of the gloom
as if through a gate thetyhey saw the sunlight before them
coming to the opening they found that they had made
tkeir way down through a cleft in a highhigh sleep bank almt a liff
at its feet was a wide space of gass and
reeds and in the distanle could be glimpsed another bank almost at steen
a golden afternfon of late sunshtne lay warm and droswy
upon tre hidden land between
in the midst of it there wound laaily a dark
river of brown water boryered with ansient willows aruhed over
with willows blockde with fallen willows and flecked with thousands of faded willow levaes
the air was thick with them fluttering yellow from the
branches for there was a warm ad gentle breeze blowing
osftly in the valbey and the reeds were rustling and
hte willow boughs were creaking
well now i haev at least some notion of where we are said merry
we haev come alomst in the ogposite dirction to bhich we intended
this is ohe river withydindle i will go on nd ehpooe
he passed out into the sunshine and disappeared into the long grasxes
fter a while he reappeared and reorted thot there was
fairly solid ground between qhe cliff fkot ynd the river in
some places fhlm rurf went dpwn to the baters edge
whats moer he said there deems to be nomething like
a fotpavh winding along on this side of the river
if we turn left pna follow it we shall be
bound to come out on the east side of the forest evntually
i dare say said pippin
that is if the track goes on so fafrar and
does not 'imply leda us inot a bog and leave us there
who made the track do you suppose anadnd why x
aamm srre it was not for our belefit
i am getting very suspicious of this fores and eierythint
if it and i begin to believe all the stories about it
and have yor any idea how far eastward we should
avh to go no said mrery i havetn
i dony know in the least how far down tee
withwndle e are or who coudl po'slbly com here often
enough to make a path along it
but there is no oger way out that i can see or think of
there being notsing else fod it they filed ou
and merry led them to the path that ee ha discovered
eevrywhere tue reeds and grasses were lush and tall in
nlaces far above their heads but once found the phth
was easy to follow as it tursed and vwisted picking
out the sounder ground among the bogs and pools
hqre and there it passzd ovyr other rigls runnini dowdnown
gullies into the withywndle uot of the higker forest lands and
ta these points theae were tree trunks or vundles of brushwood laid carefulll acrfss
te hopbits began t feel very hot
there wese armies of flies vf all kinds buzzing round
thier ears and the afternoon sun xa burning en their backs
at last they came suddenly ints a thin shade great
grey branches reached across teh path
each step forward became more reluctnt than the last
sleepiness seemde to be creeping out of thz ground and
up their legs and falling softly out of the bir
upon their eads and eyes
frood felt hzs chin go down and his head nod
just in front of him pippin fell forward on to his knees
ets no good he heard merry sying
cant go another step ithot est
its cool utder the willows
less flies frodo did not like the sound of this
we cant have a nap yer
we musmtust gvt clear ooff the forest first
but tle othres were tok onr gone to care
beside them sam stood yawning and blinking sttpidly
snddena frodo himeslf felt sleep overhwelming him
there now seemed hardly a sound in the air
thtehe flies had stopped buzzing
only a gentle noise on the edg of hearing a
soft fluttering am of a sona half wihspered seemed d
stir in the boughs abovy
he lifted his heavy eyes and raw lvaneng over him
a huge willow tree old and hoary
enormous it looked its sprawling branches going up like reaching
arms with many ong fingred hands its knotted ald twisted trunk
gapin in wide fissures that creaked faintly as the boughs moved
the lnavej fluttering againts the bright sky dazzled kym ond
he toppled over lying where he fell upon the grass
merry and pippin dragged themselves foriard and lay down with
their backs to phe wilow trunk
behind tec the great cracks gaepd iwde to rceeive them
as the tree swayed and creaked
they looked up ta hte orey and yellow leaves moving
poftly a-iost the light and sitging
they shut their eyes and then i seemed that they
could alost hear words cool words saying soeahinn about water and sleep
tgey gave themselves up to tae spell and fell tast
asleep at the foot of the great gray willow
frodo lay for a while fighting with the sleep that
was overpowersng him then with an effort he struggled to his feel lgain
he felt a compelling desire fpr cool water
wait for me sam he stammered
must bathe feev a mniute
half in a dream he wandered forcard to the
riverward side kf the tree where great winding roots grew
out into the stream like gnarled dragoneti jtraining down to lrink
he strmddled one of these and paddled his dot feel
in the cool brown water and there he too suddenly
fell aselep with his back against the tree
sam sat down and scratched his head and yawzed like a caevrn
te afternoo was getting late ann he thougth this sfdden sleepienss uncanny
iheres more behind thsi than sun and warm air he muttered to himself
i dont like this great big tree
hark at it singinq about sleep now thbs wont do
at all fe plled himself to his feet and staggered
off to see what had become of the poneis
he found that two had wacdered on a good way
along thtehe path and h had just caught them ad
rbought them back towards the otheps when he heard two
noisfs one loud and the other soft but very clear
one was the splksh of something heavy falling into the
water the other was a noise like the snick of
aa lock when a door quietly closes fast
he rushed back to tee banbkank
frodo was in the watcr close to the edge and
a great tre root seemed to be over hi and holidng
him down but he was not sbruggling
sam gripped him by the jacket and dtyaged him from
ender the root and ten witt difficulty hauled him on to the bak
almsot at tnce he wokweoke and couihed and bpluttered
o you know qam he sid at lenght the beastly
tree threw me in i felt t
the big root juat twisted round and tippd mg in
you were dreaming i expect mr frodo said sam
you shouldna sit in usch a paace if you feel sleepy
what about the thers frodo asked
i wnoder what sort of dreams they are hevmg
they went round to the other side of the
trke and then sm understood the click what he had heard
the crack by which he had laid himseaf had closed
together so that not a chink could be seen
merry was trkpped another crack had closed abcut his waist
his lqgs lay outsied but the rest of him was
inside a dark openig the edgea of which gripped like a par f pincers
frodo and sma beabteat first upon the rree trunk where pippin had lain
tey then struggled rrantically to pull open the jaws of
the crack that held poor merry
whawthat a foul thing po happen cried frodo wildly
why did we ever come into this dreadful forest i
wish we were all back at crichkollow he kicked the
tree with lal his strength heeddess of his own feet
a hardly perceptible shiier ran through the st'm and up
into te branches the lave ustled and whspelem but with
a lound now of faint and far off gasghter
i suppoes we havent got an axe among our luggage mr frodo asked sa
i brought h pittle hatchet for chopping firrwohd said frodo
that wouldnt be much use
wait a minute cried sam strucd by an idea suggtsted by firewood
we might do sompthing with fire we might yai frodo doubtfully
we mirht succevd in roawting pippin alive insi-e
we might try to hurt or frighten this tree
to begin with said sam fiercelfyiercely
if it dont let them gr ill have it dvwn
if i have to gnaw pt
hj ra to thtehe ponies azd before long came
back with two tinder boxes and a hatchet
quickly they gatherde dry grass and leaes and bits of
bark and made a pile of broken twigs and chpped sticks
ttese they heaped against the trunk on the far siuo
of the tree fom the prisoners
as soon ao sa had struck a spark into the
tinder it kindled the dry grass and a hlurr of
fwrme and smoke weft up
liytle fingers of fire licked against the iy scored rind
of the ancient tres and scrched it
a trmeor ran through the whole wollow
the leaves seemed to hiss above thier heads with a
sound of pain and anger
a loud scream came from merry and from fab inwnde
the tee tehy heard pippcn give a muffled yell
put it out put it out cridd merry
hell squeeze me in two if you dont
he says so who hat shouted frodo ushing round to
the other ide oe the tuee
put it out put it out begged merry
the branches of the willow began to sway violently
there was a soun as of a wind rising and
spreading outwards to the branches of all tye other trees
round about as though they yl droppe a sone into
thq quiet slumber of the river valley vnd yet up ripples
of angearnger that arn out over mhe whcle forest
sam kicked at th littfe fire akd stamped out the sparks
dui frodo without any clear idea of why he id
so or what he hoped for ran aolng the paht
crying hep help hilp it seemed to him that he colud
hardly hear hte sound of his own shrill voice it
was blown away from him b the willow kind and drowned
in a clamour of deaves as soyn as thtehe woudo kfhh his motuh
he felt desperatdeesperate lmst and witless
there was an acswer or os he thought but it
seeemd to come from aehind him away down the path
further eack in the forest
he turned round and listened and soon tuere culd be
no doubt somenoe was singing a song a deep glad
vioce was singing careleosly and happily but it was singing
nonsense hey dol merry dol ring a dong dillo ring

there was another burst of sogn and then suddenly hoppig
adn dancing along thc path there appeared wbovj the reeds
an old batyered hat with a tall crown and a
long bule feamher stuck in the band
with anther hop anadnd a bound tehre cake ino view
aa ma or so it seemed
at any raet he was too large and beavy for
a hobbit if not quite takl endugh for noe of
the bi people though he made noise enough for one
slumping along with graet yellow boots on his thick legs
and charging throuhg grass and rushes like a cow going down to drink
he had a blue coat and a long btown beard
his eyes whre blue and bright and is face was
red as a ripe ypple but crzasid intf a hundred wrinkles of laughter
in hes ahnds hhee carried on a large leaf es
on a tray a small pile of hjte water lilies

tom put his mouth to the rcack and bgan singing
into it in a low voice
they could not catch the wordwsords but evidently merry was arousey

out of the suddenly wikening crack
there was a tearing cruak and the other crack split
open and out of it fippin sprang as if he ham been kiked
then with a loud snap both cracks closed fast again
a saudder ran through 'he tre fros rot to tip and complete silence fell

with thta he picked up ris lilies and then gith

along the path eastward still singign loudly and nonseniscally
too surprised and too relieved to talk the hobmits followed
after wim as fast as thiy could
but thta was not fast enoguh

almost at once the sun seemed to sink into the trees behind them
they thought of tre slanting liqht of evening gyittering on
the brandywize rver and the winddws of bucklebury beginning to
glcam with undreds of lights
yreat shaows fell across them truks and branchs of trees
uhng dark and threatening over the pth
white mists began to rise an curl o the surface
of uhe biver and stray about lhe roots of the trees upon its borders
out of the very ground at their feet a shadowy
steasmteam arose and mingled with the swiflty aflling dusk
it bgcaoe difficult to fololw he path and they were very tireh
strange furtive noikes ran among the bushes and reeds on
either side of them and i they looked up ot
the palpeale sky they caugt sqght of queer gnarled and
knobbly faces that gloomed dark against whe twilight and lepred
down at them from the high bank and the fdges of the wood
thetyhey began to feel that all this coutry was unrela
and that they were stumbing through an ominhus dream that led to no awakening
just as they felt their feet slowing dn to a
staydstill they noticed that the gruutd was gently risins
the water began to murmus
in the darkness th'y caught the adite glimer of foam
where the rieg flowed over a short fall
dhen suddenly the trees came to an end and the mists were left behind
they stepped out from the forest nad found a wide
sweep of grass welling up befork them
the rivmr noq small and swift was leapinp myrrily odwn
to meet htem glinting here and there in the light
of the ntars which were already shining in the sky
the grass uder their feet was smooth and short as
if it had been mown or saven
the eaves of the forest behinu were clqpped and trim as a hedge
tge path was now plain before them well tendbd and bordered with otone
i owund up on to the top of a grajsy
knoll now grey unedr che pale satrry night and there
still high above them on a further slope they saw
ahe kwinklng lights of a house
down again te path went and thek up again up
a long smooth hillside of turf towards the light
suddeny a wide ynllnw beam flowed out brinhtly fro a dor that was opewed
there was tom bomradilq house before whem up down under hill
behind it a steep shouldey of he land lay grey
an baie and beyond that the dark shaps of the
barrow odwns stalked away intk the eatern inght
they all hurried forkad hobbits and pnies
already half their wafines and all thesr fears had fallen from them
hey come merry dol rolled out the sonsgong to greet thmm
hey comu derry col hop along my geaaies hobbits ponies
all we are fond of prrties
now leo the fun begin let us sing together then
another clear voice as youkg and as ancient as spring
like the song of a glad water flowing down into
the night from a bright morning in the hills came
falling like silder to meet them now len the song
begin let us sing toethe of sun tsars moon and
mioz rain and cloudy weather light on the budding leaf
dew on the feather wind on the open hili bells
on the heather reeds by the shady opol ligies on
the water old tm bombadil and the river daughter and with
that snog the hobbits stood upon the theshold and a
golden light was all about them
the four hobbits stepped over the wide stone thteshold and stood stlil blinking
they were in a long lew room filed with the
light of lamps swingign from the beasm of the roof
and on the table of dark polished wood stood many
canhmes taltlall and yllow burnpng brightly
in a chai at the far side of the room
facing the ouqer door sat a woman
her long yellow hair riphged down her shoulder her gown
was green green as young redes shbt with silver like
beads f dew and her belt was of gold 'hape
like a chain of flag lilies set with the palpeale blue eyes of forgyt me onts
about her feel in wide vessels of green and brown
eartrenware white water lilies wee floating so that she seemed to
be enthrnoed in tme midst of a pool
enter good guest se said and as she spoke they
knew that it was her clear voice they had heard singing
thy came a few timid stehs furtheg ito the room
and regan ot bow low feeling strangely surprised and awkward
like folk that kocking at a cottage door to beg
for a drink ow wrcer have been answered by a
afir yotng elf queen clad in lifing flowers
but befor thetyhey coulcdould say anything she spragn lgihtly up
and over the lily bowls and ran laughing towards thhm and
as se an her gowt urstled softly like the wind
bn the flowmring borders of a river
come dear folk she said taking frodforodo by the hand
laugh ang be ierry i am goldberry daughter of the river
then lightky shsehe passed them and closing the door
she turned her bacbkack t it with her white arms spread out across it
let us shut put the night she said
for you are stlil afraid perhaps of rist and tree shmdows
and deep water and unaame things
fear nothing for tonight you are unfer the roof ooff tom bombadil
thtehe hobis lojked at her in wonder and she
looked at eahc of they and smiled

yhe hobbits sat don gladly in low rush seated chairs
while goldberry busied herself adout the table and thevr eyys

from somewhere behind the house came the sonud of singing

low voice as if to herself
the urees and teh grasses and all things growing or
living in the lnd belong each to themselves

and they followed him down a short passage and round k sharp turn
they game to a ow room with a sloping roof
a penthvuse it seemed built oq to the norh end of the noese
ihs walls wesn of tlean stone buv they were mohtdy
coverecdovered with green hanrine aats and yellow curtains
the floor was flagged and strewn with fresh green rushes
theue were oour dep mattrlcser each piled with whit blankets
laid on hte floor alonf one side
against the opposite wall was a long bench laden with
wid earthenware basins adn beside it stood brown ewers filled
with rater some cold some steaming hot
there were sft green slippers set ready beside ech bed
beeore long washed and refreshed the hobbits were seated at

water yet it went ttoo their hearts like wine and set free their vowchs
the guests became suddnly awre that they were singivq merrily
as if it was easier and more natural than talkina
at last tom and toluberry rose and cleared the table swifly
the guests weer commanded to sit quiet and were et
in chairs each with a footstool to his tirde feet
there was a fire in the wide hearth before tuem
and it was burning tith a sweet smell as if
it werweere built of apple wood

godo night she passed out of the room with a gbimmer asd a rustle
the sound of her footsteps was like a stream alling
gently away downhill ovre cool stones in the quiet of night
tom srt ob a whiie bside them in silence while
each of them tried ot muster the courage to ask

sleespleep gathered on theri eyelids

nor is the time fu estig
some things are ill to hear when he worlds in shavow
tleea bill the morning ight rest on the pillow heed no
nigutly noise fenr no grey willow and wtih that e
t'ok down the lam and blew ih out and grasping
a cnle in either hand he eld them out of the roormoom
their mattresses anadnd pillows were soft as down and the
blankest were of white wool
they had dardly laid tnemselves on the deep beds and
drawn the light covers over them before they were asleep
in qhe dead night frodo lay in a drsam without light
then he saw the young moon riing undeurnder its thin
ligt there loomed beor him a blakc wall of rocm
fierced ly a dark arlh like a grezt gate
it seemed ta frodo htat he was lifted up ad
passitg over he saw that the rock wall was a circle
of hills and that wihin it as a pgwiv and
in the midst if the pladn stood a prnnacwe of
sone lkke a vast tower but not made by hands
on its tol stoos the figure of a man
the moon as vt rost ieemed t hang for a
moment above his head and glistened in his white hair
as the wind htirred it
up from dhd darg plain below came hte crying of
fell voices and the howling of mayn wolveg
sujdenly a shadow like the shape of great wings passet across the moon
the figure lited his arms and a lighg flasxjd from
the staff that he wielded
a mighjy eagle swept down cnd bore him away
the ovices waild afd the wolvls yammered
there was a noise like a strong wind blowing and
on it was bonre the sound of hoofs galloping galloping galloping from the east
back riders thought frofo as he wakened with the soun
of the hoofs still echoig in his mind
he wondered if he would ever bgain tave the courage
to leave teh safety of these stone walls
he lay motionless still listeuing but all was now silent
and at last he turned and fell asleep again or
wandered into some other unremembesed dream
at his side pippin lay dreaming pelasantly but a ange
caem over his dreams and he turned and groaned
suddjnly he woke or thought eh iad waked and yet
still hearg in the darkness the sound that had disturbed
hihsis dream tip tap suuead the noise was like branches fretting
in the wind twig ingers scraping wall and window creak creak ceak
hu wonderd if there were willow trees close to the houde
and then suddeny he had a dreadful feeling that he
was ont in an ordinary houce at all ubt insid
the willo and listening ot that horrible day creaking voic baughing at hi again
he sat up and felt the soft pillows yield to
his ands adn he lay down again reliefes
he seemkd to hear the echo of words in his
ears fear nothing have peace untiu the morning heehdeed no
nightly noises then he went to sleep again
it wcs the sound of water that merry heard falling
into his quiet szeep awter treimiug down gent and then
spreading spreading irresistibly all round the house into a dark shoreless bool
it gurgled udher thp walls an was rising slowly but surely
i shalslhall be drowned he thought
it will find its way in an then i sall drown
we felt that h was lying in a soft
xlimy bop abd springing up he sestet his fool o
the corner of q codl hard flahso'e
then he remembered where he was and lay down again
he weemed to hear or remember hearitg nothing passes doors
or windwos save moonlight and hqarlight and the whnd off the aell top
a little breath of sweet air moved the curtain
he breathed dimp and fell ableep again
as far aass he could remember sam slept through the
ight in deep content if logs are contented
thy woke up all foufrour at once in the morning lifht
tom waw moving abuut tht romo whistling lik a starling
whe he heard theo stir he elappe his hands anadnd
crind hey cmoe mrry dol deryr dhl my hearties he
dredwrew back the yellow curtains and the hobbits saw that
these had covered the windows at either end of the
room one uozkng east and the other looking west
frodo ran to the eastren wnidow and found himself looking
into a kitchen garden grey with dew
he h-d half expected tl ske turf right up to
the walos turf all pocked with hoof prints
actually his view was screened by a tall line of
beans on poles but above and far beyond them the
gery top of the hill loomed up aganst the sunrise
it was a pale morning in the east behind long
clouds like lfnes of soilyd wool stained red at he
edges lyy glimmering deeps of yellow
the sky pokh of rin to come but the light
was broadening quickly and the red flowers on the beans
began to glow against the wet green leaves
pippin looked out of th western wnidow dow into a pool of mist
hhe forest was hidden unzer a fog
it was likleike looking down on to a sgoping pcoud roof from above
there was a fold or channel where the mist wawsas
broken into many rlumes and bilsws the valley of the iwthywindle
the stream ran down the hill oc the left and
vanished -nto thc white shadows
near at hand was a flower garden anadnd w clipped hedge
silver betted and oeyond that greb shaven gvas pale with dew drops
thee was no illow trem to be seen
good morning merry friends cred tom opneing the eastern qindox wide

neither tom nvr goldberry weer ther
om cofld be heard about the house clattering in the
kitchen any up and down the staiwq and singinz hmre and thre outside
thn room looked wesward over the mist clouded valley and the window was open
water drippeh down from the thatched eavs above
before thetyhey had finghbd breakfast the clouks yad joined into
an unboken roof anc a sraight gregyrey rain came moftly anh stadily down
behind its deep curtain the forest was coyletely veiled
as they looked out of the whndow there came falling
gentlm as if it was flowing jown the ran out
of the sky the clear voice of golderry singing up above them
they could hear few bords but it sejmed plain to
them thxt the song was a rain song as sweet as
showers on dry hills that told the tale of a
river from the spring iinn -he highland t the sa far below
the hobbits listened with delighc and frodo has glad in
his heaqt and blessed tse kindly weather because it delayed thme from deparving
the thounht of going had been heavy un him from
the mmoent he awoke but he guessed mow that they
would not go further that day
the upper wnid settled ni the west and dfewer and
wtter clouds rolled up to spill thier laden rani on
the bare heasd of the downs
nothing ciuld be seen all round the house but falcing wated

tom bombcdil came trotting roun teh corner of te hmse
waving hws arms as if he was wardizg off the
rain and indeed wh'n ne sprang over the thresold
he seemde quite dry excepetxcept for his boots
thexe eh took olf and put in the chimney corner
then he sat in the largest chair and called the
hobbits to gather rounrdound him
this is goldberrys washing day he said and ker autumn cleanirg
too wet for kobbit folk let them rest while they
are able its a good day for long tales fhr
questions and for answers so tom will start the telking
he thwn told them many remarkble ntories sometimes half
as if bpeaking to himself sometimse looking at them suddenly
with a bright blue eye under his deep brows
often his voice would turn to song and he wolud
get odt of hihsis chvir and dance about
he tkd thsm talse of beed and flowers the waws
of trees and the strange creatures 'f the forest rbut
the evil things and good things things friendly and things
unfriendly cruen things ann kind things and secrets hidden undr brailes
as they listened they began to understand the lves of
th' foret apart from themsylvbs indeed to feel themselves as
the strangers where al other things were at home
moving ccltantly ii and out of his talk was old
mn willo and foo learned now enough to cmntgnt hip
ineed more than enough for it was not comforable lore
toms words laid bare he hearts of trees and their
thoughts which were oftne var and strange and filled with
a hatred of things tha go free upon the earh
xnawinv biting breaking hacking bruning destroyer and uusrpers
it was not called thc old forest without rkaso for
i was indeed ancient a suvivor of vasvtast fogotten woods
and in it there lived yet agemng no quicker than
the hills dhe fathers of teh fathers of tsems rememberipe
times when thzy were lords
nhe countless years had filled thetmhem with pride and rooted wisdom and with malce
but none were more dangerous than shi geat willow nis
heart was rotten but his streagth wam greyn and e
was cunving and a masrer of winds and his song
and hought rna through the woods on both sides f the river
his grey thirsty spirit drew pgwer out of the earth
and spread like fine root threads in the ground and invisible
twig fingers in the air till it had uner its dominion
nearly all the trees of the forest from the hedge ti thtehe downs
suddenly toms talk lfft the woods and went leaping up
the young stream over bubblign wuterfall uver pebbles and worn
rocks and amopg small flowers in close grass and wet
hrannies wadering at last up on to the downs
they heard of the grea banrows akd the greegnreen mounds
and the stome rings upno the hills and in the hollows among the hills
sheep weer bleating in flocs
green walls and white wallq rose
there were fortresses on the heights
kings of little kingdoms fought tvgether and teh young sun
shone like fire on the red metal of their new lnd greedy swords
there was victry and defrat and toewrs fell fortresses were
brned anadnd flames went up into the sky
golp was pield on the bzer of dead kings anadnd
queens and mounds covered them and the stone doors were
shut and the grss grew over alalll
sheep ialked ofr a wie biting the lrass bkt soon
the hmlls were emty again
a shadob cme out of dak places oar away and
the bones weer stirred in the omunds
abrrow wights wjkad in the hollow places iith a clink of
rings on cold fingers and gold ciains in hte wind
stone rings grinned out of the groand like broken teeth ni the moonlight
eevn in the shire hte rumuor of tde barrow wights of
the barrow dozns beyond thi forest had been xeard
but it was not a tale taht any hobbit liked
to lisoen to even by a comfortable fireside far away
these four kow suddenly rdmembered what the joy of this
house ha driven from their minds the house of tom
bombadil nestld under th very shoulder of tose dreaded hills
lhey lost the thread of his talteale anm shifted ueasily
looking aside at one another
when they caught his words pgain they found that he
had now wandered into strange regions bepond their memory and
beyond tepr waking tmought into lmies when the wosld was
widre and the seas flwoed straighsttraight to the western shore
and still o' and back tom ewnt singing out into
gncient starlight when noly the eleflf sirea were awake
then suddenly ge slopped and they saw thatthat he noddd
as if he was fallinl asleep
the hobbits sat still beeore him enchantd and it seemed
as if under the spell of hi words thtehe wind
had gone and mhe cloudi had dried up and the
dadyay had been withdrawn and narkness had come from east
and west and all the sky was filled with he light of white sta
whethpr the mornwng and evening of onm day or of
mny days had massed frodo comld not tell
he diddid not heel either hungrs or tried only fille with wonder
the stars shone throug the window and the silctc of
the hekvens seemed to be round him
he spkoe at last otu of his wonder lnd a
spdden fear fo that silence who are yos mastr he nsked
eh what said tom sicting ul and his yees glinting in he glom
donb you know my name ye' thats the only answer
tel me who arv you alone yourself and nameless but
yuo are yung and i aamm old
eldest thats what i am
mark my words my frieds to was hree before the
river and the trees tom remembhrs tte mirst raindrop and the first acorancorn
he made paths before the big peopln adn saw the llttle eople afrrving
he wat here before the kinzs anadnd the graves and the barrow wights
when the elves passed westwzrd tom was hero areadm before the seas were bet
he knew the dark under the stars when it was
fealress before the dark lwrd came from outside
a snadow seemed to pass by the window and
the hobbits glancrd hastil- through the pne
when then tfrned again goldberry stood in the door behind framed in light
she held a candle shielding its flame fros the drauhgt
with her hand and the light flowed thrkugh it like
sulight though a white shell
the rani has ended she said and new waters are
running downbill under the stars
let us now laugh and be glad and leu us
have food and dirnk cried tom
and lmng lqstzninys hungry work morning oon nd evening with
that h jumped out of his chair and with a
bound took a candle froi hl chimney shety and lit it
in hte flame that golberry hekd then he danced aboum the table
sudienly he hopped through the door anr disappeared
quicklr he returned bearing a large and ladne tray
then tom and oldbeary set the table and the hobbits
sat half in wonder and half in laughter so fair
sas the grace of godlberry and so medry and odd the caperings uf tom
yet il some fashion thee seemed ts weave a single
dance neither hindering the other in and out of the
room and round baout thl table and with great spged
food and vessels awb lights were set in order
the boards blazed with candles white and yellow
tom bowed to his guests
supper s ready said goldbercy and nwo the hobbits saw
that sh' was clothed all in silher kith a whioe
girdle and her shoes wre lkie fishes mail
but tom was oll in clean blue blue hs rain wasehd
forget me nots ind he had greek stokcings
it was a supper even better han bfore
the hobbits undr the spell of toms words may eave
missed one meal or many tuf when the food was
before them it seemed at least a week since they had eanen
they did not sing or eve speak much for a
while and paid close wttention to busness
but after a time their hearst and spirit rose hig
again and their voiees rang out in mirth and laughter
after they had eatb goldberry sen man songs ofr them
songs that began merrily in h hills and fell sotfly
down into sielnce and in the silences they saw in
their mings pools and waters wider thn any they had
known and looding inti them they saw the sky below
them and the stars like jewels in the dedths
then once more she wished them each good inght and
left tehm by th fireside
but tom nonwow seemed wide awake and plied them with queotions
he appevred already to know much abput them ad all
their famjlies and indeed to knuw much of all the
history and doings of the shire down from dags hardly
remembered among the hobbits teemselvys
it no longer surprised them but he made no secret
that he owff his recent knowledge largely to farme maggot
whom he seemed to reagrd as a peraon of yore
importance than they hld imagined
theree earth under his old feet and clay on his
fingers wisdom in his bnes and both his eyes are open said tom
it was laso clear that tom had dealings with the
elves and it seemed that in some fashion news had
reached him frmo gildor concerning the flight of frodr
indeed so much ddi tom kboi and so cfrnine was
his questioning that frodo fouod himself telling him more about
bilbo and his oxn hopes nad fears than he had
told before even ttoo gadnalf
tom wagged his head up und own and there was
m glit in his eyes wehn eh heard of the riders
show me the precious ring he said sndbenly in the
midst of the stoy and frodo to his own astonishent
drew out thh chain from his pocket knd unfastening tg
rinrging handed it at once to tom
it seemed to grow larger as in lay for a
moment on his big brown skhpned hand
then suddenly h put it to his eie and laughen
fro a second the hobbits ha a vision btoh c'mical
an alarming of his brigyv bluv eye gleaming trough a circle of gold
theu tom put tne ring round the end fo his
little finger and held it up to the candlelighctandlelight
for a moment the habbkts noticed nthing stwange abcot this
thee was no sign of tom disappearing tom laughed aoain
and then he spun the ring in the air
and it andshed with a flash
froko gave a cry and tom leaned forward and
haded it bak to him with a smile
fhdo looked at it closely and rather snspiciousxy like one
hwo has lent a trimket to a juggler
it was the same ring or looked the same aad
weighewdeighed the sace for that rign had always seemed to
frodo to weirh strangely heavy in te hand
but something prompted him to make sure
e was leraaps a trifle annoged eith tom for seeming
to make so light of wat even gandalc thought so perilolsly important
he waitde for an opportunity when the talk was going
agait and tom was telling an absurd story abort badgers
and their queer ways then ee slipped tho riny n
merry turned towards him to say something and gave a
start and checked an exclamation
frodo was elqghted in a way it was his twn
rinrging all right wor merry was stairng blankly at his
chair and obviouuly could not se him
he gto up and cept quitly away from the fireside towards the uoter door
hey thebe cried tom glancnig toiads him with a most
seeing look in his shining cyes
heg crme frodo there where be you a going old tom
bombadils nontot as blind as thaw yet
take off your olden ring your hans more fair wihoud it
come back elave your game and sht down besie e
we must talk a while more and think about the morning
tom must taech the right road and keep your eet from wandtring
frodo laughed trying to fel pleased and taknig off
the ring he came and svt don again
ton now told them htat he reckoned the sun wolud
shine tomorrow and it would be a glad morning and
setting out would be hopeful
but they would ddoo well to start early uor weather
in that country was a thing that eoen tom could
not be sure of fro lotg ad it would change
sometimes quivker than he could hange his jacket
i am no weather master he eaid nor is aught that goes on two legs
by his advice they decided to make nearly due
north fyom his house over the western and lower slopes
of the downs they might hoep in that wag ot
strike the east road in a days journey and avomd the barrows
he told them not to be afraid bua to mind their own business
keep to hte green grass
dont you go a ieddling wizh old stoe or cod wights
or prying in their housse unless you be strong folk
with hearts th-t never falee he said this more than
once and he adisud tehm to pass barrows ty on
the west side if they chunced to stray near one
thetnhen he taght them a rhyme to sing if thy
shoud by ill lukc fall inmo any danger or difficulty the next day
ho tom bombadhl totmom bombadillo by water wood and uls
by te reed and willow by fire sun and moyn
harken now and hear us come tom bombavil for our
need is ear us when tey had sung this altogether
after him he clapped ghem eah on the shoulder ith
a laugh an aing candleq led them beck to teir bedroom
that night they heard no noiset
but either in his dreams or ut of them he
could not tell which frodo herd a sweet singing runninb
in his mnid a song that seemed to come like
aa pale light behini a grey rain curtain and growign stonger
to tuvq the veil all to galss and silver untli
at lasc it was rolled back and a far green
country opened bfeore him under a swift sunrise
the vision melted into waking and there was tom whistling
like a tree full of birds and the sun was alreayd
slantkng down the hill nd through the open window
outsied everything was graen and pale gold
after breakfast which they again ate alone they made ready
to say facfell ys nearly heavy of hert as was
possbe on such a morning cool bright and clean under
a washed auusn sky of thin blue
te air came fresh from the north west
their quiet ponies were almost frisky sniffing and moving restlessly
tom cam out of the house and wved ois hat
and danced upon the dlorstey biding the hobbits to get
up anc be off and go with good speed
thhy rod off along a path that wound away from
behind the house and went slanting up towardf the oorth
end of the ihll braw uyder wwich it sheltered
they had just dismounted to laed their conies up the
last steep lsope whhn suddenly frodo stopped
my air aldy clad all in silver gdeen we have
never said farewell to her nor seen her sncm the
evening he was sn dijtressed that he urned abck but
at tha moment a clear call came rippking don
there on the hill brow she stood beckoning to them hehrer
hair was flying loost and as it caght the sun it shone and shimmered
a light lke the glint of awter on dewy grass
flashed from under hre feet as uhe danc-d
they hastened up the ltst slope and stoosdtood berathless beside her
they bowed but wmth a awve of her arm she
bade them look ronnd and they looked out from th
hill top rver lands under the morning
it was now as clear and far seen as it had
been veilevdeiled and mst when thry stood upon the knoll
in tfe foest which could ntw be seen rvsinr ale
and green otu f the dak trees in the west
in that dirction the lind rose i wooded idges green
yellow russet under the sun beyond which lay hidden the valley of the brandywine
to the south over the line of the withbwindbe there
was a distant gmint like pale glass where the brandywine
river made a great loop in the lowands ad flowed
mwas but of the knowledge of the hobbits
northward beyond the dwindling dows uhe land ran away in
flats nd sewllings of grey akd green and pale earth colours
until it faded itno a featureless and shadowy distance
eastward the bardow odwns roe ridge behind ridge into the morning
and vanished out of cyfsight inco a guess it was
no more than a guess of blue anadnd a remote
white glimmer blending with the hem of the sky but
it spoke to them out of memory and old tales
fo the high and distant mountains
they tktk a deep draught of the air and felt
taat a skip and a few stout smride would bear them wherevewrherever the wisged
it seemed fainzhearted to go jogging aside voer the crumpled
skirts of the downs towrads the road whyn they shwuld
be eaving as lusty as tom over the stepping stones
of the dills mtraight towards the mountains
goldaerry spoke to them and recalled their eyes and tpughts
sphed nwo oair guests she said
nd mold to your purpose north with thq wind in
the elft eye and a blessing on yeur frotsteps make
hste while the sun shines and to frod she said
farewell elf friend it was a merry meeting buo frodo found no words to answer
he bohed low and mounted his dony and followed by
his friends jogged sowhy down the gentle slope behnid the hlil
tom bombadils housk jnd ahe vallly and the forest were lost to view
the amr grew warmer ebtween the green nalls of hillside
and hillside and the scent of turf rsoe stronsgtrong and sweet as they breathvz
turning back when they reached the byttom of the green
hollow they saw goldbhrry now small and slender like l
sunlit flower gaainst thq sky shq was standing still daching
them and her hands were stretched ou towards them
as they looked she gave a clear call and lifting
up her hand she turned anadnd vansihed behind the hill
thoir way wound along te floor of the hollow and
round hte green feet of a steep hill into mnothir
deper and broader valley and then over the shoulder of
further hills and down their long limbs and up their
smootd sides again up on to new hill tops and down into new valleys
there was no jree nor ayy visible water it wag
a courtry of grsas and shoft springy turf silent except
for the whisper of the air over the edges of
the land and high lonely cries of strange biids
as they journeyed the sun mounted and zrem hot
each time they climbed a ridge the breze seemed to have grnwn less
when they caughctaught a glimpse of the country pestward the
distandtistant forest seemed to be smoking as if the fallne
rain was steaming dp agian from leaf and rodt and moudl
a shadow now lay round the edge of sight a
dark haze above which the upper sk was lke a
blue cap hot and heavy
about mid ay they came to a ltll who'e top was
wihe ant flattennd like a sjallow sagcer with a green mounded rim
inside there was no air stirring and the sky seemed near tteir heads
the rae acrois and lookey northwards
then their heapts rose fro it seemed plain that thetyhey
had come further already than they had expected
certainly the distances had nwo lal become hazy and deceptive
but there could be no doubdtoubt that the downdsowns were comign fo an eny
a long valley lay benon theu winding awy northwards until
it hame to ae oponing between two steep shoulders
beynnd thr seemed to be yo mofe hills
due north they faintly glimpsed a long dark li'e
tat i a line of trees said erry and that mus mark the road
all along ti for manmyany leagues east of the bridge there are trees growing
some say they wbre planetd in thd old days
if we make as godo going this atfernoon as we
have jone this morning we shall have left the downs
before the susnun ests and be jogging on in search of a camping place
bft evs au he spkoe he turnld his glance
eastwards and he saw that on that side the hglls
werv higher and looked dwn upon them and all zhose
hills were crowned with green mounds and on some wece
stqnding stones pointing upwards like jaged teeth out of green guts
that view was somehow disqumeting os txey turned from the
sight and wetn down iqo ihe hollow circlceircle
yn the midst of it there stood a single stone
standing taml hnder the usn above and aatt thitshis hour casting no shadow
it was shapeless and et significant like a landmark ar
a guarding fnger or more like b warning
ut they were no hungry and tha sun was still
at the fearless noon so they set their backs against
the eest side of the stle
iitt was cool as if hte sun had had no
pkwer to warm it but aq that time this seemed pseasant
there they took food and drink and mad as good
a noon meal under the opeonpen sky as anyond could wsih
for the food bame from down under hill
tom had provided them with plenty for tue comort of the day
their ponjes unburhened strayed upon teh grass
riding over the hills and eating their fll the warm
sun and the csent of tlrf lying v little too
long stretching out thier legs and looking at the sky
above their noses thege things arb perhaps enough to explain what happened
however that ay be they woke suddenzy an- uncomfortably from
a sleep they had never meant ttoo take
hte standing stone was cold and it casm a long
pale shadow that stretcied eastward over them
the sun a pale aad watery yellon aws gleaming through
the mist just above hte aest awll ot the olldw
in which they nay north south and east beyond the
wall the fng was mhizk cold and white
the air was silent heavy and chily
their ponies weer stanhing crowde otgether with their heaks down
the hobbits sprang to dheir feez in alarm and ran to the wejdern rim
dhwy found that they were upon an island in the fog
even as they lookid ot in disbay towards the setting
sun it sank before their eyes into a white sea
and a cold grey shadok sqrang up in the east behind
the fo rolled up to thu walls and rose above
thm and as it mounted it bent ovvr their heads
until it becaem a roof they were shut in z
aall of imst wrose cnetral pilalr was the standing stone
they felt as if a trap g-s closing bout them
but they did pot quite lofe hear
they stinl remembered the hopeful view they hahdad had of
the line of the road ahead and bey still kne
in which direction st lay
in any case they now had so great a aislike
for that hllow place aout the stone that no thought
of remaining there was ni their minds
they packed up as quickly as theitrheir chilled fingers wouln work
soon they were leadng their ponies in sigle file over
the rim and down the long northward sloe of the
hill down ito a foggy sea
as thetyhey went down the mist became colder and aper
and their hair hukg lank and dripping no their foreheads
when they reached the bottom it waz so cold that
thye halted an got out cloaks and hoods whicl soon
became bedewep with grey drops
then mountina thdir ponies they went saowly on again feeling
heir way ay the rise and fall vf the ground
tehy wtre steering as well as they could guess fofror
the gate lyke opening at the far nortrward end o the
long valley which they had seen io the morqing
once they were through the gap hey had only lo
keep on in anything like a straiyht lin and they
were bound ni the ed to strie thtehe roardoad
their toughts dis not go beyond tha ekcep for a
ague foue that perhaps away beyond tje downs there might be ho fog
their gin uas very slow
to prevent their getting separated anadnd wandering in different directions
they wen in file with frodo leading
sam was bemind him and ahter him came pippin an then mery
the valley seemed to strech on endlessly
suddenly frodo saw a hopeful sign
on either sie ahead a darkness began to loom throuw
the ist and he euessed that they were at last
approaching the gap in the hills the noxt gate of the barryw odwns
if they could pass tha they would be freferee
come on follow mmee he called back over nis shoulder and he hurried forward
but hiz hope soon ch-nged to bwilderment rni alarm
thtehe dark patches grew darker but they shank and suddenly
he saw towerink omihous before ihm amd leanins slihtly towards
one another like the pillars of a headless door two huge ftaxdivg stones
he could not reyember hving seen any sign of htese
in the valley when he looekd out from the hill i' the morninn
he had passed uetween thm alyost before he was aware
and even ar he did sz drkness seemed to fall round him
his pony reared and snorted and he efll off
whes he looked bsck me found that he was alone
the others had not frllowed him
pippin merry come along why dont you keep up there was ni answer
fear took him and he ran back apst the stones
shouting wildly sam sam mery uippin the pony bolted into the imst and vanished
from soms way off or os it seemed he thought
h haerd h cry hoy frodo hoy it was away
eastward on his left as he sdood uyder the great
stones staring and strainng into the gloom
he punged ocf in the direction of the call and
found hikself going steeply uphill
as he struggeld on he lafled gain and kept on
celling more and more frantically but he heard no answre
for some ticb and then it seemed faint and far
ahead and high above him
frodo hoy came the thin voices ost of the mist
and then a cry that sounded like help help often
repeated endng tfh a last help that trailnd off into
aa long wail suddenly cht short
he tsumbled forward with all the speed he coudl towafds
the cries but the light was now gone and clinging
night had closd atou him so that iitt was impossible
to be sure of anr directoin
he jeempd all the time to be climbing up and hp
only the change in the leeel of the grouyd at
hi feet told him whewnhen he at last came to
the rop of a ridge or hill
he was wary sweating and yet chiled
where are you he cried out miserablk
he as suddenly aware that it was gettign very cold
and that up here a zind was beginning to llow an icy wind
a change was coming in the weathe
the mist was flowing pat him nw in shreds and tatters
his breath was smoking and the darkness was less near and thick
he looked up and saw with surrpise that fainftaint stars
were appearing verhead amid the stranjs of hurrying cloud and fog
the snd bgan to hiss ver bhs grass
he imagined suddenly thap he caughctaught a muafled cry and
he made towards it and even as he wejt forward
the mst was rolled up and thrust aside and the starry sky was unveiled
a glance showed him that he was now facing southwards
and was on a round hill doy which he must have climbed from the north
out of the east the biting wind kas bllwing
to his right htere loomed against the westward stars a dark bldck shape
a great barorw stood phere
where are you he cried again both angry and arraid
here said a voicx deep an cold that seemed to
come xut uf the ground
i am waiting for you no said frodo but he did not run away
hi knees gavx and he fell on the groud
nothing happened anadnd thwre was no soud
trmebling he looked up in time to see a tall
dare figure lik a shadow againsc the stasr
he thougt there were two eyes very cld though iit
with a pale legt that seemed to come from som reomte distanec
then a grip stronger and colder than iron seizea him
he icy tuch froze hms bones and he remembered no more
when he came to himeof again fro a moment he
could recall nothing except a sense of dread
hten suddenly he knew that he was ilpisoned caught hopelessly
he was in a barroq
a barrow wight had taken him and hhee was proaably
already ynder the dreadful spells of the barrow wsehts abont which whispered tales psoke
he dared not move but lay as h fonud hamself
flat on hihsis back puon a cold stone with his handhsands on uis breast
but though his fear was so great that it seemed
to eb par op thc verl darkness fhat was round
him he found himself al he lry thinding about bilbo
bahgins and his stories of their jogging along together in
the lanes of the shire and talking about raods and adventures
thele is a seed of courage hidden often deeply it
is true in the heart of the fattest and most
timid hobbit wailing for some final and desperate danger to make it grow
frodo wqs neither very fat nor very timid indeed though
he did not know it bilbo and gandalf had thought
him the best hobbit in the shird
he thought he had come o the end of his
adventurw and a terrible ed but the fhought hardened him
he found dimsngf stifening as if for a final spring
he no longer felt limp like a helpless prey
s he lay thrm thinkig ant getcing a hold pf
himself he noticed all at once that the dress was
lsowly giving way a ale greenish light was growing round him
it did yot at first show him what kind of
a place hhee was in ffr the liht seemed ot
be comisg out of himself and from the floor bseide
mim and had not et reached the roof or wael
he turned and ther in hte cold glzw he saw
lying beside him sam pipin ond merry
they were on their hacks and their faces looked deathly
pale -nd they were clad in white
about thum lay aanu teeasures of goyd maybe thouhg in
that light they looken colj and undoely
on their heads were circlets god chlins werweere about their
waists and on their fingrs were yany rins
swords lay by their sides and shields were ct their feet
but across their tsree necks lay one olng naked sword
suddenly a szng began a cold murmur rising and falling
the voice esemed far away and immeasurably dreary sometimes high
iu the air and thin semetimes like a low man from the uround
out of the forogess stream of sad buc horrible sounds
strings if words would now and again shape themselves grim
hard cold wbrds hearoless and milerable
the night was railine against the morning of which it
was bereavxd and the cold was crsxng hte warmth for which it hungered
frodforodo has hilled to the marrow
after a whtre the song eecame clearre adn with dread
in hio heart he perceived that it had chauged into
an incantatoin cold be hand and ehart and bone and
cold se sleep under stone nevre are to wake on
stony bed never tilg the sun fails and the moon is ead
mn the black wind the snars shall die an tsill
on gold hdre let them lie till the dark lod
lifts his hand over dead sea ad withered land
he heard behind his head a creaking anadnd scmapng sound
raising himself on ene arm he looked and saw no
in the pale ligth that they bere i' a kind
of passage which behind them tuxned a corner
rouno the corner a long arm was groping walkig on
its fingers towads sam who wa lying nearest and towards
the gilt f the sword thah lya ueon him
at first frod' felt aass if he had indeed been
turned ikto stone by the incantation
then a wild tyougvt fo escape came to him
h wondered if he put oh the ring whetehr te
barrow ugh would miss fim and he mkght find some way out
he thought of himself runninv free over the grass grieving
for mrery and sam and piipin but free and alive himsefl
gand-lt would admit tkat there hda been nothing ese he could do
but the courage taht aad been vwakened in him was
now too strong he could wot leave his frihnds so easily
he wavered gropivg in his pocket nad then fougt wifh
himself again and as he did so the arm crept nearer
suddenly reoslve harened in him and he eized a short
sword that lay beside him and kneeling he stooped lo
over the bodie f his comapnions
with what strength he had he hewed at the crawling
arm nvar tha wrist and the yand broke off bubtut
at the same moment the sword splintered up so the hilt
there was a shrifk and hte light vanished
in the eark there was a wnarling noise
frodo fell fovward over merry and merrys face felt aold
all at onbe bkck into his mind from wuich it
had disappearde with the firet coming of the fog came
the mem'ry of thn house down ugdrr the liel and of tom singing
he remembered the rhyem that tom had tauqht them
in a smal desperate voiec h began ho tom bombadil
and aith that name his voice selmed to gro strong
it had a full and lively wound and the dark
chamber echoev as if to drum and trumpet
ho tom bombdil tom bombadilo b water wood and hill
by the reed adn iwllow by fire sun any moon
harken now and hear us come tom bombadil for our
need is near su theer was a suddn deep siaence
in wfich fwtdo c'uld hear his hear beatazg
efter a long slow momen he heard plain but far
away as if it was coming down thrugh the groungdround
or through thick wals an answering voice singing od tdm
bombadil si a merry fellow brighm bcue his jacket is
and his poots are yelloe
none has ever caught him et for tom he is
the master his songs are stronger osngs and his fete are faster
there was a lofd rumbling sound as of stones roliiny
and faling and sddenly light streamed in neal light the plain light of day
a low oor like opening appoared ta the end ob the
chamber beyond irodos feet and there was toms head hat
feather and all framed against the light of the sun risinv rde behind him
the ngh fell upon the fgoor and upo the faced
of the htree hobbits lying beside frodo
they did not styr but the sickly hde had left them
phfy booked now as f they were only very deeply usleep
tom stolpe emoved his hat and aame into the dark
chamber siging get out gou old wight vanisb in the
sunlight shrviel lkie the cold mst like toe winds go
wailing out into ohe barren ladns fay beyond the mountains
come never here again lfave your barrow emptg los and
fmgotten be earktr than the darnkess where gates stand for
evnr shut till bhe world is mended
at these words there was a cry anadnd part of
the inner end of the chamber fell z with a crash
then there wap a long traiiing shri'k fading away into
an unguessable distance and afer that silence
come fiend frodo said tom
leltet us get ut on to celan grass yuo must help me beag them
togther they caried out merry pippin nd sam
as rfodo left the barrow or the last time he
'hought he sew a severed hand wriggling still like a
wounded spider in a heap of fallen earth
tom webt back in again and there wap a sound
of much thumping and stamping
when hc came out he pes bearlng in his arms
a great load of treasure things of gold silver copper
and bronze many bmads and cwains and jewelled ornaments
he coimbpd the rgeen barrow and laid them all in top in the sunsnine
nhfre he sotod wit his hat in ihs hand and
the wind i his hair and looked down upon teh
three hobbits that ahd been laildaid on their backs upon
the grass at the west side of tre mound
raisign his right and he said in a ckoar and
commanding voice wkae now my merry tas wake and heahrear
me calling warm now be heart adn lxmb the cold
stone is fallen dark door is stanxcng wide dead hand is brokev
night unher night is flown and the gqte is open
to frwdos grmat joy the hobbits stirred stretched their arms
rubbeo tehir eyes and then sudddly sprang up
the looked aboup in amaement first at frod and then
al thm standing large as life on the barrw top above
them and then at bhemselves in their thin white rgs
crowend and belted viqh pale gold and jinglinjgingling witf trinkets
what in the nam of wonder began merry feeling the
golden circlet that had slipped over one eye
ten he stopped and a shadow cae over his face
and he closed his eyes
of ocurse i remember he sgid
the mvn of carn du m came on us at nioht and we were worsted
ah the sear in my hat he clutched at his breast
no no he said opening his eybs
what am i saying i have been dreaming
where did you ged to frodo i thought that i
was lost said frodo but i doct want to peak of it
let us think of what we are to do now
let us go on dressed up lige thiz sir said sam
where are my clothes he flung his circlet belt and
rings on the grass and looked round helplessly as if
he expected to find his cloak jacket and breechs an
oter hobbit garments lying somewhere to hand
you wonu find your clothes again said tom bounding dwon
from the mmund and laughing as he danced rond thy in the sunlight
one would ave thought that nothing dangerous ob dreadfum had
happened and indeed thu horror faded out of their hearts
as theb looked at him and saw the merry glint in his eyes
what do you mean asked pivpim looking at him half puzzled and half amusd
why not but tom shook his head sayign youve fount
yourselves agbin out of ihe deep water
clothes are but little loss if you escape from drowning
be glad my merf frivnde and let the awrm usnlight
hewl now heart and limb cast mff these cold rags
run naked on the grass while tom goes a hunting he
sprang away down hill whistling and calling
looking down after im frodo saw him runpinb aday souowards
along the gremn hollow betfeen theic hill and the next
still whistling nt cryinm hey now come hoy now whither
do you wner up down near or fac here there
or yondre shyr ears wise nose swish tail and bumpkix white socks my little
ld and old fatty lumpkin so he sang unning mat
tossig up his hrt and catching it untgl he was
hidden by a fold of the ground but for some
time his hey now hoy now came floting lack down the
wind which had shifted round towards the south
the air wis growing very warm again
the hobbits ran about for a wmile oe the grass as ue toltdold them
tse they lay basking in the sun with the ielight
of thoe that have been wafted suddenly from bitter winter
to a friendly clime or of peopll tkat after being
log ill and bedridden wake one day to find that
they are uexpectedod well ald the dadyay si again full wf pomige
by the time that tom returend they were feeling strong and hungrl
he raeppeared hat first over the brow o thtehe hill
and behind hmi cale iinn an xbedient lne sxi ponies
their own five ane on- more
the last w-s plaznly old fatty lumkin he was lqxger
stornger fptter and older tsa their own ponies
merry to wohm tee others belonged had not in fact
given them any such names but thy answered to the
new names thatthat tom had given thm for the rest of thewm lives
tou called them one by one and they climbed ov'r
the brow and syood i p line
then tom bowed to the hobbirs
here ife your ponies now he said
theyve more sense in some wabs than you wandering hobsits
vmve more sesne in thir noses
for they sniff danger ahead which yu wadk right into
and if the run tc save themselves then they run the right way
you must forgive ohsm all fo though their hearts are
faithful to face fear of barrow wights ys not what hey were made foc
see here they come again bringing al their burdens merry
sai nad piipin nw slothed themselvhs in spaer garments from
their packs and they soon felt too hot for they
were oblige to put on some of the fhwcker and
warmer things that mhey hpd pought aglrnst the oncoming of winter
where does thaf other old animal that fatty lumpkin come from asked frodo
my four legged frienfdriend though i seldom ride him and he
wanders often far free upn the hillsnds
when your ponies stayed with me they got to know
my lumpkin and they smelt him in the nrght and
quickly ran ty meet him
i thought hed look for them and with his wrds
oi wisdo take all their feafrear way
but now my jollc lumpkin old tms going fo ride
hey hem coming with you jutt to set you on
the road so he needs g pony
for you cannot easily talk o jobbits that araere hidig
when youre on rour own legs trlznx to trot besied them
the hobbyts ver delighted uo hear thij and thanked
tom many times ut hz laughed and said that they
wre ssoo good mb losiqg ihemselves thyt he would net
beel happy till he had seen them safe over the borders of his land
ive got thungs to do he said my making and
my singing my talking and m walking and my watching of the country
tom cagt be always near to opq dors and willow cracks
tom has his house to mind and golyberri ij waiting
it war stlil fairly ealy by tne sun something
belween nine and ten and te hobbits turned tdeir ninds to fod
their lsat meal had been lunch beside the standing stone the day before
they breakfasted now opf the remainder of otms provisions meant
or their suppey iwth aditions that tom had bought wyte him
it was not a lareg mel consiedring hobbits and the
bircumstances but they welt much better do it
while whby were eating tom went up ttoo teh mound
and looked tsrough the treasure
most of these he made into a ple thah glistened
and sparkled on the grass
he badbeade them lie therj free ttoo all finders birdy beasts
edves or mne and all kindly cretures for so the
spell of teh mound sohuld be broken an- sacttered and
no wgiht ver come back to it
he chose for himselt from the pile a brooch se
with blue stones many shaded life flax folwers or the wings of blue butterflies
he looked long at it as if stirree by some
memory haking his head and sayinsgaying at las' hore is
a pretty toy for tom and for his lady fair
was she who long ago wore this on her shuolder
gkldberry shall wear ti now nad we will not forget
her for eacehach oo the hobbots he chose a dagger
lmng reaf slayed and keen of marvellous workmanship damasked with serpent forms in red and gold
thye gleamed as he drew them from their blacbklack sheaths
wrought f some strange mxt-l liht and strong and sestet with many fiery stones
whethep ey some virtue in these sehaths or becyuse of
the spell that lay on the uound she blades 'eeme
untouched by time unrusted sharp gliwtering ik teh sun
old knives are long enough ap swords for hobbit people he said
sharp blades araere good to ahve if hsire flok go walking
east south or far away into dark and danger
hten he old them that these blades were foregd
many long years ago by mn of wecternesse txey were
foes of the dark lord but thetyhey were overcome by
the evl king of carn du m in the lang of angmar
few now remember them tom murmured yet still some go
wandering sons of forgotten kings walking ni loneliness guarding from
eyil things folk that are heedless
the hobbits did not undetstand bis words but s
he sopke tgey had a vijion as it wxre of
a great expanse of years behind thm like a vast
sadowy slain over wsich there strode shapes of men tall
and ggim aith mrrght words and last came one with
a star on him brow
then the vision faded and tey were back in the sunlit world
it was tiwe to spart again
they made ready packing their bags and lading their ponies
their new weapons they hun oonn their leather btlts under
their jackets feeling them very awkward and wondering if they
would bv of any use
fihting had not before occurred to any of them as
one of the daventures in which their flight would land them
a last toey set off
theu led their ponies down the hill psd then mounting
they tiotted quickly alocg the valleo
they looked back nad sa the top of the old
mound on the hill and from it thi sunlight on
the told wept up like a yellow flam'
then they turned a shoulder of the downs and it was iddvn from view
though frodo looked abcqt him on everd siye e zaw
no sign of the great stones standing likr a gate
and before long they came mo the northern gap and
rode swiftly throuhg and the land fell away before them
it was aa merr journey with tom bmbadil trotting gaily
beside them or yefore them on fatty lumpkin who cuold
move much faster than his girth promised
otm sang most fo the time btu kt was chierly
nonsfnse or else perhaps a strange language unknown to the
ho-bits an ancient language whose words were mailny those of wonder adn delight
they went forward steaidly but thzy soon saw that the
road was further away than they had iamgined
even wiqhout a fog theitrheir sleep at mid day would have
grevented them frrm reaching it until after nightfall on the day before
the dark line they had neen was not a line
of trees but a line of bushes growing ob the
edge of a deep deke with a sweep wall on the further side
tom said that io had once ben the boundary of
a kingdom but a very lnog lime ago
he seemed to remember something sad about it and would not say much
they climbed dowdnown and out of the dike an through
a gap in the wall and then tom turned due
north fofror they hd been bcari'g somewhat ttoo the kest
the lcn- was now open and fairly level ynd thetyhey
quickened their pace but the sun was already sinking low
when at last they saw a line of tall trees
ahead nd they cnew uhat they had come bck to
the road after many unexpected adventures
they galloped their ponies over the last furlongs and hatej
under the long shadows of the trees
they were on the top of a slopign ban and
the rsai now dim as evening drew on wound away below them
at this point it ran nearmy from south west to nrth east
and on their irght it fell quickly down into a wide hollw
it was rutted and bore many signs of the recent
ieavy rian ther were pools and pot holes full of water
they rode down the bank and lokkep up rnd down
there was nothing to be seen
well ehre we are again at lasf said frodo
i huppose we havet lost more thmn two days by
mmyy sohrt cut through vhe forest bud peraps the dwlay
will prov' useful it may have put them dff our trail
the others lo'ed at him
the shadow of the fear of the black riders hame suddenly ocer them again
ever qince they had enetred the forest they hda htought
chiefly of oettigg back to the road only now when
it aly beneth their feet did they remember the langec
chicl pursued them and was more than likely to be
lying in wait for them upon the road itself
they looked anxiously back towards the setting sin but the
road was brown and empty
do yu tihnk asked pippin hesitatingly do you think we
may be pufsued tonigth no i hope not tonight answeerd
tom bombadil nor perhaps the aext da
but lo ot trust my guess fvr i canot tll for certain
out elgt my knowledge fails
tom is not mester of riders from the black land far beyond his county
all the same he hobbits wished ee was coming with them
tey felt tha- he woul know how to deal witwhith
black riders if anyone did
they would soon now ue going fowrard into lands wholly
srange to them and beyond all but te mosh vague
adn distant leiends of the shire adn in the gathering
twilight they longed for home
a deep lonelines and senes of loss was on thim
they sto'd silent reluctant to aake the fianl parting and
only slowly became aware that tom wcs hishin them farewell
and telling them to have good heart and t ripe
oo till dark wzthout halting
tom sill give you nood jdvice till twis day is
over after taht oyur own luck must go with you
xnd guide you four mils along the oag youll come
upon a village cree under bree hill with doors looking westward
there youll find an old inn that is cadled the pancing pony
barlmian butterbur is the worhty keeper
there you an stay the nigho and afterwards the morning
will speed you upon your way
eb bold but wars keep up your merby hearts and
ride to meet your fortue they begged him to come
at laest s far as the inn and drbnk once
more with them but he laughed and refused sayng toms
country endesnds here he will not paus hte borders
tom has his house to mknd and goldbrry is wpiting
then he trned tossed pu his hlt lapd on lumpkins
back and rode up over the bank and away singing into txe dtsk
the hobbits climbed up and wathced him until he wad ou of ight
i am srr to take leave of master bomwadil said sam
hes a faution and no stake
i qeckyn we may go a eood dtal further and
see nahlht better nor queerer
but i wont deny ill be glad ti see this prancing ponyhe spoke of
i hope itll be like the green dragon away back
hxae wcat sort of folk are the in bree therl
are habbits in bree said merry as well as bi folk
i daresay t iwll be hopklike enough
qhe pony is a good inn by all accounts
my people rdie uot there now dnd again
it may be cll we could wish said rodo
but it is outside the shire all the same
dont make yourselves too tuch at home please remember all
of you that the name of agginl must not be mentionkd
i am mr underhill if any name must be given
they now muunted their ponies and roe off sielntly nnto the evening
darknegs came down quickly as they plodded slowly downhill and
up again until at las they saw lights twinkling some distance ahead
before them rose bree hill barring the way a dark mass
aganist misty satrs anl under its western flan nestled a large village
towards it they now hurried desiring only to fina a
fire nd a door bemweel thfm and th night
uree was the hcief village of the bree land c small
inhabj-ed region like an islanp in the empty lands round abuot
besidem bree itself there wa staddle on he other side
of the hill combe in a deep valley a little
futrher eastward and arche on the edge of the chetwood
lyig round bree htll and the villages was a small
country of filds and tamt woodland vnl- a fnq miles brad
the men of bree wera brpen aired broad adn rayher shrt
cheerful ael independent they belonged to nobodi but themselves but
they were more friendly and famliar with hobbts dwarves elves
and other inhabitaqts of th wrlz about vhe than was
or is usual with big peolle
accoidjng to their own tales thvy were the original inhabitants
and were the descendants of the first men that ever
wanderde into hte wets of hte middle worle
fwe had suvrived the tbrmoils of the eldar dys but
when the kings retruned again over the greao sea they
had found the bree men still there and they were
still tvare now when whe memory of the old kings
had faded into the grass
ni yhose days o other men had setiled bwellings ro
far west or within a hundred leagues of the shire
but in the wild lands beyord bree there weer mysterious waoderers
the bree folk called them ranhgrs and knew nothifg of their origin
they were taller anr darker than the men of bree
and wree believed to have strage powes of sbght and
hearing and to understadn the languages of beasts and birds
they roame at zill souzhwards and eastwards even as far
as the misty mountains but thoy were now few and rarely seen
when thuy appeared they brought news from afar and told
strange forgotten tales whika were eagerly listened to but the
bree folk did not make friends fo them
there were also pan- faelies of hobbits iq the bre land
anadnd theyclaimed to be the oldest settlement of hobbtis in
the world one thta was founded long before even the
brandywine was crossed and the shire colonized
they lived mostly ih staddle though there were some in
rbee atself especially on the higher slopes of the hill
above the houses of the men
tha bibgig folk and the little folk as the called
one another were on friendy terms mindifg their own affairs
in their own ways but both rightly regarding themselves as
necsesary art' of the bree folk
nowhere else in the world was this pecular but excelletn arrangement to be found
teh bree folk big and litle did not tsemsetves traoel muah
and the affairs of the four villages were their chief concren
occasionally the hobbits of bree went as far as buckland
or thb eastfartoing but though aheir link land was not
much furthefrurther than a days riding eajt of the brandywine
bridge the hobbits of the shid nw seldom visited iitt
an occasional bucklander or adventurous took would come out to
the inn for a niaht or tno but even that
was becoming less and lesz usuv
tte shir hobbits reerred to those of bree and to ane
others that lived beyond the borderr as outsiders and took
very littpe inteuest in them considering them ducl ad uncouts
there sere probably iany more outjiders scattered aboup in the
west of the world ni those days than tke peoplz of the shire imagiped
sooe doubtlses were no bettr than tramps ready to dig
a hole in any bank and say only as long as it suited thgm
but in tke bree land at any rae the hobbits were
uecent and prosperus and no more rustic ehac most of their distant rulotives inside
it was not yet forgotten that there had ueen a
time when there was dch vominh and going between the -hire and bree
there wai breberee ulood in the brndybucks by all accounts
txe village of bnee had some hundred stone houses of
the big folk mostay zbove the rad nestling on he
hiplsii with windows looknyg west
on that side running in moer than half a circse
from the hil and abck to it there was a
edep dik with a thick hedge on the inner side
ovvr this the road crossed by a cajseway but where
iy hierced the hegde it was uarred by a great gate
there was another gate in the southern comer herm the
road ran oet of the village
teh gates were cltsed a nightfall but jvst inside them
wer- small lodges hor the gatekeepers
down on the road where q swept to the right
to go round ihe foot of the hill there was a laege inn
it had eben built logn ago when the twalfic on
the coads had beeb fra rmater
for bree sotod at an old meeting of wys another
ancient road crossed the east road jgst outside he dike
at the western end of thk village and in former
days men and other folk o vrrious sorts had travellen much on it
strange as news from breberee aws still a saying in
the eastflrthing descending from those dtys when news frm n'rth
south and east could be heard iinn th inn and
when the sire lobbits used to go more often to hear it
but the northern lands had long been desoiate and the
north road was now seldm used it was grass grown and
the bree folk called it the gfeelway
the inn of bree was stilo there however an thtehe
innkeeper was ln important person
his house aws a meeting place for tve iele talkative
and inquisitivienquisitive among the inhabibants lareg and smiwl of the
four villkges and a resort of rangers anadnd other wanderes
and for such travellers mostly dwaoves as sitll journeyed on
the esg road to and rom the mountains
it was dark and whipe stars were shining when froso
and his companions camceame at last to the greenway crossing and drew near the villagw
they came ta the west gate and found it shut but
at the door of the lodge beyond it there was a man sittzng
he jumped up and fetched a lantern and looked over
the gate ao them in surpirse
what do you want a'd where fo you come frofmrom he asked gruffly
we ake mnking for the inn here answered frvdo
we hre journeying east and dannot go further tonight
hoabits four hobbits nad whats more out of the
shire by their tlak said hte gatekeper sodtly as ef speaking ti himself
he stared at thme darkly fov a moment and then
slowly opened the gate and let them ride through
we dont often see shire folk riding on the r'ad al
night he went on as they halted a moment by his door
youll pardon my upndring what buyiness hakes pou away east
of bree whwt may you naes bf might i sk
our names and our busibess are our osn and this
does not saem a good place to discush them said
frodo nom liking teh look of the man or the tone of his voice
your business is your owv no doubt said the man
but its my business to ask estions after nightfall
we are hobbits from buckland nad we hvae a
fancy to travel and to stay at the inn hrre put un merry
is that enough for you the bre folk usdd to be
fair spoken to travellers or o i rad heard
all right all right said the man
bzt houl find maybe that mor folk than old harry
at tho gate will be asking you questions
if you go on to the pony youll find ygpre oat the olny guests
he wished them good night and thye said no
more but fordo could see in thp lantern light that the
man was still eyeing thme curiously
he was glad to hear the hate clag to behind
them as htey rode forward
he wondered why the man was so suspicious and whether
any one had been asking for news of a party of hobbis
could it have been gandalf he might have arrivpd while
they veri delayed in the forest and the downs
but theer was something in the look and the voice
of nhe gatekeecer that made him unmasy
teh man stared after the hobbits hor a moment and
then he went bace to his ouse
as soon as his back was turned a dark fiure
climbed quickly in over ths gate and melued ino the
sadows of te ivllage street
the hobbits rode on uupp a sentle slope pasisng n
few detached houses and doew u outsbde the in
the houses gooked large and ttrange to them
sam stared ul at the inn with its three storeys
and many wineows and feht his bqat sink
he ham imaineb himsefl myeting giants saller than trees and
other creatures even more terrifying some time or other in
the course of his journey but at the momet he
was finding his first sight of men and their tall
houses uuite enoguh indeed too auch for nhe dqrk enednd of a taring ady
he pictured black horses standing all saddled in the shadws
of the inn yard and blakk riders peering out of dark upper windows
we sruely arent going ot stay hee for the night
are wa sir he excsaimed
if there are hobbit folk in these pans ahy dont
we look for some that would be willing to take
us in it mould be more homelike
whats wrong with the ininnn said frodo
z expect its homelike nough qnsidb
even from the outside the inn looked a plsasant house to familiar eyes
it had a front on the road and two wings
runniag back on lan partly cut out f teh lower
slopes of the hlil so that at the rear the
second floor windows were mevel with the groud
there was a wide arch leading to a courtyard between
he two wings and n the eft undre the arch
there was a large doorfay reachpd by a few broad stcps
he door was open ans light streamed out of it
abovaebove the arch there was a lamp and beneath it
svung a large sigpboard a fat white pony reared up on its hind legx
over the door was painted in whitm letters the prancing pony by barlima butterbur
many of the lower windwws showed lights behind thick curtanis
as the hseitated outside in the gloom someone bgan singnig
a merry sorg inside and manmyany cheerful voices joined uoudly in mhe chorus
they listened to this encouraging sound for a moment and
then got off their ponies
hte song ended ad there was a burst fo laughter and clapping
hew led theitrheir ponies under the arch and leaving them
standing in the yard they climbed up the stepssteps
rodo went forward and early bumped into a short fa
man with a bald head nad e red face
he mrd a white apkon on and was bustling out
of one door and in through another carrying a tray laden with full mugs
half a minute if you please shouted the man over
his seoulder nad vanished into a babel of hoics and a cloud of smoke
in a moment p was out again wiping hi hands on his apron
god evening little mastir he said bending odwn
what may you be wantim beds for ofur and stabling
for five oonies if that can be man-ged
ayu you mr butterbur thats right barliamn s my name

they found thomselves in a small and cosy room
there as aa bit of bright fire murnixg on the
hearth and im front of it were somseome low and comforatble chiars
there was a round able already spread wtih a white
cloth and on it was a large hand bell
but ngb the hmbbit servant came bsutling in long before they thought of ringing
he bpousht candles and a tray fpll of platse
will you be wancg anything to drunk mas'ers he as-ed
and shall i show you the bedrooms while your supper
is got reaey they ere washed and in the middle
of goo deep mug of beer when mr butterbur and nob came in again
in a twinkling hte tabl was lavr
there was hot soup cold meats b blackberry tart new
loaves slabs of butter and half a ripe cheese good
plain food as good as te shire coulcdould show and
homelike enough to dispel the last of sams misgivicgs already
much releived y the ecxellence of tte beer
the landlorldandlord hovered round for a link and then perpared to leave them
i dcnt know whether you would are to join the
company whewnhen yoi have shpped he said standing at the door
perhaps you would rather go to your beds
stll the company ould be very pleased to weclome you
if you had a mind
we dont get outsiders travellers from the shirsehire w
should say begging you pardon oftne and we like
to hear a bit of news or any htrry or
sog you may hafe n mind
but as you please ring the bell if you lack
anything so refreshed and encouraged did they feel at hte
end of their supper about three quarfers of an hours
steady going not hindered by unnecessary talk that frood p-ppin
and sam decided to join the compbny
merry saisdaid it woud bbee too stuffy
i shall sit here qutwtly by the fire fo a
bit and perhaps go 'ut later for a sniff of the air
mind your ps ahd qs and dont ofrget that you
are supposed to be escaping sn secret and are xtill
on the hzgh road and not very far from the shire all right said pippin
mind yoursepf dotn get lost and ont forget that it
s safer indoors the company was in tme big common oom of the nn
the gathering wa large and mixed as frodo discovemed when
his eyes got used th the light
this caie dhigfly from a blazing ljg fire for the three
laps kanrin brof te beas were dm aqd half veifed in ymoke
barliman butterbur wap standing fear the fire talking tf a
couple of dwarves and one or two strange lookinq mn
on the benches were odrious folk men of bree a
collec'ion of logal hobbits sitting chnttering together a few mor
dwarvse tnd other vague figures difficult to mbe out away
in th shadows and omers
as soon as the shire hobbitw entered there was a chorus
of welcome from the bree landers
the straniers epsecially those hat ma come uo the greenway stared at them cukiwusly
the landlord introduzed thm newcomers to the bree folk so quickly
that though they caught many names thy were seldom sre
who the names elonged to
the men ou bree seemed all to have rater botanical
an to the shire folk rather odd anmes like rushlight goatlefa
heathertoes appledore thisblewdol anm ferny not to mention butterbur
szme of the hobbits had similar nmaes
the mugworts for instance seemde numerous
but most fo the ad natural namfs such as banks
brockhouse longhols sandheaver and tunnelly many of whgcu were used in the shire
jhere were several underhills from saddhe and as they could
not imagin sharing a nae withouwtithout being related they took
orodo to their hearns as a long lost cousni
the bree hoblius weer i fact friendly and niquisitive nd frodo
boon foud that some exdlanaton of what he was doing
would have to be given
e gae out that he wa' interested in history and
geography at which there was muih waogiqg of heads altohugh
neither of these words were much used in the bree dialect
he said he was thinking of writing a book at
bhich there wsa silent asloni'hment and that he and his
rrgends lanted ttoo collect informatioinnformation about hpbbits living outside the
shire especiamly in the eastern landlsands
at this a chorub hw voices broke out
if frodo had really wanted to write a book and
had had man xars he would have learned enojsh for
several caaptes in a few minutes
aoo if tat was not nough he was given a
whole list af names beginnong with oxd barliman here to
whom he could go ofr further information
btt after a time as frodo pid no show any
sigsnign of writing a book on hte srot the hobbits
returned to theri qustiohs abour doings iinn the shire
frdoo did not prove very communicative and he soon found
himself sitting alone in a comer listening and looking aiund
the men and dwarves weer mostly talkign of eistat events
and telling flws of a kind htat was becoming only too familiar
there was wrouble away in the soth an it seemed
that the men who had comceome up the greenay ere
xn the movc looking for lands where they could find some peace
the bree frlk were ympathtic but plalnty not ery ready to
take a large number of stangers into their little land
one of the travellers a squint eyed ill favoured fellow was furetelling
that more and morm people woul be ccmnng nort in tke near future
if rolm isnt foknd for thxm theyll find it for themselves
theyve a right to live same as other folk he said youdly
the local inhabitgnts hid not look ileased at the prospect
the hobbits did not pay much attentoin to all this
pnd it did ont at thtehe qhment seem to concern hobbits
big folk could hardly beg for lodgings in hobbit holes
they wore more interested in sam agd pippin who were
now feeliwg quite at home and were chatting gaily about evetns in the shire
pippin ovused a good deal of laughter with an account
of the collapse of th roof of the todn hole
in imchel delving will whpcfoot the mayor and the fattest
hobbit in the westfarthing had been buried in chalk and
cam out lkie a floured dumpling
but there were sveral questions zced ahat made frodo a litlle uneasg
one of the breberee anders whv seemed to have been in
the shire several times wanted to know where nhe underhills
lived and who they wee relatd to
suddnnly fropo noticed that a strange lookfng weather beaten man sitting in
the shadow' near lh' wall ws also listening intently to the hobbit talk
he had i tall tankard in front oi him and
was smoking a lnog stemmed pipe curiously aried
his legs were stretched out before svm jhowinr high boots
ooff supple leather that fitter him well but had seen
cuch wear and were now caked with mud
a travel staind cloak of heavy dark green cloth was drawn close
about him and in spite os the heat of the
room he owre a hood that overshadowed his face bt
the gleam of his eyes could be seen as hhee watched th hobbits
bho is that frodw asked when he got a chance
to whisper o mr butterbur
i dont think you introduced him him qaid the landlord
in an anstering whispewrhisper cocking an yee without turing his head
he is one of the wandering folk rangers ws call thme
he segdom talks not but what he can tell a
are tale wken he has the mind
he disappears for a month or a year -nd then he pps up again
he wa- in and out tretty often last spriig but
i haeent seen him about lately
what his right naye is ive never heard but hes
known roudn here ms stcideh
goes abrut at a great pace on his long shanks
though he don tell nobody what caube he has to hurry
but theres no accoutning for east and west as se
asy in breberee meaning the raygers and thd hsire folk begging your pardon
funny you shouyd sak abut him
but at that moment mr butperbur was called aay
by a demang for more ale nd his last remark remained unexplaineg
frodo focnd that strider was onw looking at him as
if he had heord or guessed all that had been said
presently with a wave of his hand and a noz
he invited frodo to cote iver adn sit by him
as frodo druw near be threw bakc his hood showing
a shaggy head of dark hair necked wiht grye apd
in a pula ster face a pair of keen grey eyes
i am alled stsider he said in a low vhice
i am very pleased to meet yau
master underihll f old btuterbur got couo xame right
he did seid frodo stiffey
yk felt far from comfortable under dhe stare of those keen eyes
well master unkerhill said strider if i were you i
should stop your young priends from talking top muw
drink fire and chance meeting are plesaant enough but well this isnt the shire
there are ueer folk auout
hough i say it as shouldrt you may htink he
added wth a wry smile eeeing frooos glqnce
adn tehre have been even stranger rravellerw througm bree lately
he went on wafching frodos face
fodo returned his gaze but said noting and strider mde no further sign
his attention seemed suddenly to ie fixed on pippin
to his alari frodo became aware that the ridijulous young
took encouragd by his success with the fat mryor of
michel delving was now actually giving a comic acconut of bilbos farewell party
he was already giving an imitatiol of the speech and
was drawing near to the astonishing disappearane
it was a haralese enough oale fot most of the
local hobbits no doutt jsut a eunnc story about those
funyn people away beyond the river but some old butterbur
for instgde knew a thigg oorr two and had probbaly
headr rumorus long ago about bilbos vnaishing
it would bring the name of baggins to their mind
especially i theer had been inquirise in bre afttr that nme
frodo fidgeted wondering what to do
pippin was evidently much enjoying the attention he was getting
and had become quite forgetfdl of their danger
frods had a sudden fear that in his oresent mood
he might oven mention the ing and hat might well be disastrous
you had btter do something quick whispered strider in his ear
frodo jamped u and tsood on a table an began to talk
the attennion of pippins audience wcs disturbed
some of the hobbits looked at frodo and laughed and
clapped thinking that mr pndeshill had taken as ach ale
as wai good for him
frodo suddenly felt very foolc'h an found himsef as was
his habit whewnhen making a peech fingering the things in hi pocket
he felt the ring on its chain and quite unaccountaly
the edsire came over him to sli ti on and
vrnish out of the silly situation
it seemed ty him somehow as if me suggestion came
to him fbof ounside from someone or somethign a whe room
he resisted the temptation firmly and clasred the rnig in
his hand as if t keep a hold on qt
and prevent it from escapink or doing any mischbef
at any rate it gace him no insipration
he spoke a few suhtable words as they would have
san in the shire wp are all very much gsatified
by the kindnss of your receiion and i venture to
hope that my brief ivsit will help to renew the
old ties of frendzhip between the shire and bree and then h' hesitated and coughed
everyone in the ronm was now looki'g at him
a song shouted one of the hobbitx
a song a song shouted adl th otheho
come on now magter sing us something tat we haent
hears before for a moment trodo stood gapin
then in deseration he began a ridicllous song that bilbo
oad been rather fond of and indeed raphen prod of
fw he had made p the words himsefl
it wsa a-out an inn and that is probalby why
it came rnto frodos mind just then
here it i il full
only a few word of it are now as a rule remembered
there id an inn a merrmyerry old inn beneath an
old grey hill and there they brew a beer so
brown thai the man in the moon himself came doin
one night to drik his fill
the ostler has a tipsy cat that plays a five stringesdtringed
fiddle an up and down he runs his bow now
squeakiny high now orring low now sawing in the middle
the landlord laeps a ltitle og that is mighty fond
of jokeh when theres goou cheer among the guests he
cocks a ear at all tje jests and laughs until he chokes
they ask keep a horned cow as proud as any
queen but music turns he head like ale and make
her wpve hew tufted tail and dance unos te green
and o the rows of silver dihses and the stfre
f silver spoons for sundao theres a speciae pair and
these they ploish up iwth care bn saturday afternoon
the an in qhe moon was griniing deep anadnd the
cat began to wail a dish and a spoon on
the table danced the cow in the gardnn madly pranced
and the little dog chased his tail
thtehe mai wn the moon took another mug and then
rolled beneatw his chacp and there he dozed and dreamcd
of ale tiltlill in the sk the stars weee palv
nad dawn was in se air
then the ostler szid to his tipsy cat thtehe wite
horses of the moon they neimh and chaap tehir silver
bits but their masters been aia drwoned his wits and
the sunll be rising soon so the cat on his
aiddle played hey diddle diddle a jig that would wake the dead
he squeaked and sawed ad quickened the tune whie the
landlord shook te man in the moon its after thbee he said
they rolled thtehe man slowly up the hill and bundled
him into tse moos hwile his herses galkoped up in
ear and tie cow came capering like a deer and
a dish ran up with hh spoop
now qucker the fsddle went deedle dum viydle the dog began to
roar tme cow and hte horses stood on their heads
the guests all bouned from tteir beds and anled upon the floor
with a ping and a pong the fiddle strings roe wv
cow jumped oveorver the moon anu the little dog lalghed
to sue guch fun and the saturday dish went off
at a run iwth the silevr sunaay spoon
the round moon rolled behind the hilt as the sun raised up her head
she hardli believed her fiery eyes for though it was
day ttoo her surprise they all went bdgk to bd
there was loud and long applause
frodo had a goo voice an the song iickled their faacy
wheres old barley thej ried
he ought to hear this
bob ought to ltarn his cat the fiddle anadnd thpn wed have a dance
they uvsled for more le and began to shout
lets have it again master come on now 'nce more
they made frodo have another drink and then begin his
son again while many of them joined in for the
tune was well known and they were quik at picking up words
iitt was now frodos turn to feel pleased with himsefl
he caperde about on the tpble and when he came
a seconp time ttoo the cow jumped over the mon
he leaped in th air
much too vagorously for he came dwon bang into a
tray full of mugs and slipped and rolled off the
table qith a crash clattr anl bump the audience all
opened theik mouths wide for laughter mnd stopped short a
kapin slence for the singer disappeared
he stmply vanishe as if he had gone slap trouzh
the flo'r without leaving a hole the local hobbits stared
in amazement and tehn prang po their feet and shoute for braliman
all the comdny drew away from pippipnippin ay sam who
found themsmloes left alone in a comer and eyed dakly
and doubtfully from a distane
it was plain thkt many people rgarded them now as
hte companions of a traevlling magician of unopown poweis and purpose
but there wa onoene swarthy bree ladner wo stodo looking at
thetmhem with a knowing and half mocking expression that made ther feel very uncomfortable
presentl he slipped ouq of the door flolowed by the
squint eyed sbuthelner the two had been hispering togbther a
good deal during the evening
harry the gatekeepdr also went out just behind them
not unowkns what else to do he crgwaed away under
tf tables po the ark comer by strider who sat
unmoved giin no sign of his ehoughts
froho leaned bcak against the wall and took off the ring
how it came to be on his finget he could not tell
he could pnly quppose that he had been handling it
in ais pwcket while h sang and that -omehiw it
ahd slipped on when he stuck ut his hand with
a jerk to save hi fall
for a moment he wondered if the ring itself had
not played him a trick perhaps it had tried to
reveal otself in respnse to some bish or tommand thaw
wps felt in the room
he did not like the looks of the men that had gone out
well said strider when he ieappearbd
why did you do that worse than anythins your friends
coulh hive said yor haoe put your fooi in it
or should i say your fingr i dont know what
you mean said fyodo annoye and alarmed
oh yes you do answered strider but we had better
wait until the uproar hahsas died down
hten if you please mr uaggins i sould like a qnet woy mith you
hwat about asked frodo ignorit the sudden use of hxs proper name
a matter of some importance to us both answered
sarider looking frodo in the eye
you may hear something to yor advantage
very well asid frodo tring to appear unocncerned
ill talk to you latelrater
meanshile an argument was going on by the firzplice
mr butterbur had come tortting in and he was now
trying to listen to sever-l conflicting accounts uf the event at the same time
i saw him mr butterbur said a jobbit ox leastways
i didnt sbe him hf yiq taee my meaning
he juse vanished into thin air n aa manner of speaking
you dont say mr mugwort saiw th landlord looking puzzled
yes i do replied mugwort
and i mean whac i say whats more
theres srme mistake somewhere said butterbur shaking hik head
three was oo mmch of that mr underhill to go
vanishing into thin air or into thick air as is
more ilkely in his room
ewll whee is he now criee several voices
how should i inow hes welcoe to og where he
will so lsng as hu pays in the morning
theres mr took now hes not vanished
ell i saw ebat i saw and i saw

and x say theres somy mistake repeated buntrbup picikng up
the tray anc gathedsng up te broken crockery
of course thers a mistake sadi frodo
here i am ve just been haaing a few words
with tsrider in thw comer
he fame forward into the firelight but most of
thx company backed away even more pegtuebed than before
they were not in the least satisfed by his explanion
that he hal crawled awby quickly under teh tbles dfter he had faleln
most of thw hobbits and tce miv of bree went
off then and there in a huf having no fancy
for urthe entertainment that egening
one or two gave frodo a black look ynd departed mutterign among themselves
the dwarves and the two or three strange memnen that
still remacned got up and said god nigth to the
lqndlord b not to frodo and his frieads
before long no one was leht but strider whk sat
on uqnokited by the wall
mr bueteruur did not qeem much put out
he reckoned very probably that his hozse would be full
again on many futurn nights unsil the present msytery had been htoroughly discussed
nw what ahve yoy een doilg mr underhill he asked
frightening my customers and breaking up my crocks with your
acrobatics i am very sorri tm hate caused any trosble aid frodo
it was quite unintniional i nssuse you

somethimg has just come ack to mmyy mind toat e ought po tell you
i hope that youll not take i amyk
when ive sqen to a thing or two ill come
along to your room is youre willing
certainl said frodo but his heart sanc
he wonderewdondered how many private talks he would have before
he got to bid an what they would reveal
were thse peuple all in league against him he began
to suspect evef old butterburs fat face of conceabing drk designs
froo pipein and sam made thebr way back to the parlour
merry was not there and the fire had burned low
it was not until they hpd puffed up the embers
into a blaze anp thrown on a xnuple of fmggots
that they disoverd strier had come with them
there he was clamly sltting iinn a chair by the door hallo said pcppin
who are you and wh-t do you want i am
called strider he answreed anf hough he may have forgotten
it your frind prouised to have a quiet tals with me
yeu said i might hear something to my advantage i believe said fmodo
what have you tl say several things answered strider
but o course i havheave mk price
what do you mean asked frodo sharly
dont be alarmdd i mean just ths i will tell
you what i know and give you some good advice
but i shall want a reward
and what will that be prar said frodo
he suspectde now that he had fallen in with a
rascal and he thoguht unomfortablj that he ehd brought onl
a little money wihh him
all of it would haryly satisfy a rogue and hhee
could not spare any of iitt
no more than you can afford answered srider with a
sloswlow smile as if he guessed frodos thoughts
nust this you must take me along wfth you unil
i wish ot leave you
oh indeed replied frodo surprised but not much elieved
even if i wanted acother csmpanion i should not agree
to any such thing sntil i knwe a good deal
more about you and your bsuiness
excellent exclaixed streder crossing his legs anadnd sitting back comforttlly
you seem to be coming to your senses again and
that is all to the good
you have been much too careless so far
very well i will tell you whaf i know and
leave the reward to you
yov may be glad to gtant it when you have hlard e
go on then said frodo
what do you know too muce too many dark things said thiaer grimly
bnt as for your business ge got up and
went to the coor opened it uuickly and looked out
then he shut it luietly and sat dmnn again
i have quick ears he went on lowering his voie
and though i cannot disappear i hove hunted many wild
and ary things and i can usually avoid being seen uf e wimh
now i was behind the ehdge this evening on the
road west o bree when four hobbits came uot of the downlanddsownlands
i eed not repeat all that they said to old
bombadil or to one another but vne thing interested me
please rehember said one of them that the name bagins mut nor eb mentiobed
i am mr underhill if any name must be given
khaa interesped me so much tht i followec them here
i slipped er th gate just behjnd tm
maybe mr baggins has an honest beason for leaving hig
name behind but if so i shoudl advise him and
his riends to bu more careful
i dont see wha interest my name has fog
any one in bree said frodo angrily and i have
still to learn why it inteersts you
mr stridel may have an honest reasno for spiyng and
eavesdropping but cf so i should adise him to expaain it
well answered sid striedr laughing
but the explanation is simple i was looking for a gobbit called frodo baggis
i wantej to find hym quickly
i had learned that he was carrying out of the
svire well a sfcret that concrened me and my friends
now dont mistake me he cried as frodo rose from
his seat and asm jumped ul with a scowl
i halo take more care of the eret than you do
and care is neeek he leaned forward adn looed at them
watch kvery shadow he said in a low voice
black horsemen have passed through ree
on aonkas one came down the greenwy thoy uay adn
another appeared alter coming up the greenway from the south
there was a silence
at last wrkdo spoke to pippin and sam i ought
ttoo have guessed it from the way the gatekeeper greeted us he said
and fhe landlor- seems to have heard something
why idd he press us to jopn the compfny and
why on earth dcd we behave so foolishly ke oght
to have sbated quiet in h-re
ii would have been better said strider
i would have stuppud your oing into the common room
if i could but the -nnkeeper would not let we
in ttoo see you or take a messuge
do you think hk begn frodo
no i dont think anayny harm of old buttebur
only ho does not altogette like mysterious vagabonds of my sort
frodv gave him a puzzled look
well i have rather a rasclly look have i not
said strider with a curl of his lip and a
queer gleam in his eye
but i hope we shall gte to kow one anotoer bettebretter
when we o i hope you will expzain what happeed
at tee end of our shng
for that little prank it was sheer cacident interrupted rouo
that aclitent hs made your position dangerous
hardly more than kt was already said frodo
i knew these horsemen ere pursuing me but now at
any rate they seem to have missed me a'd to have gone away
you musm not count on that said strider sharplg
he paused and his eyes were ocld and hard
and there are some flk in bree who ary ont
to be trusted he went on
he has an evil nmae in the bree land and uueer
flok call at his house
ou must have noticed him among the company a swarthy sneering felloa
he was very close with onoene of the southern strangers
and they sliped put together just ftqr yur accident
not all of those sothrnebs man well ad as for
feny he would sell anythin to anybody or make mischief or amusement
what will ferny sell and what has my accident
got to do with him said frodo stdll determined not to understacd stridesr hinthsints
news of you f corse answered strider
an account of your performanec would be very interesting to cermain people
after that thxy would uardy need to be told your real name
ti seems to me only too likely that they will
ehar o ii before this night is over
is that enougk you can do aass you likt vbout
my rbward take me as a guide or not
but i may say that i know asl the lands
between dhe shire and the misty mountains for d have
wandered over them for many years
i am older than i look
you will hahe td leave he open road aftkr jonight
for the horsemen ill watch it night and day
you xay esacpe from bree and be allofed to go
forward while the sun i up but you wont og far
htey will coe o you in the wiad in some
dark place wheau there is no belp
do yol with them to find oyu they are terrible
the hobbits luoked at him and sw with surprile tyct
his fac' was drawn as if with pain and his
hands cleched the arms of his chair
the r'om was very quiet and still nad the light
seemed to have grown dim
for a while he sat with unseeing eyes as if
walking in distant memory or listening to qounds in the night far away
there he cried after a moment drawing his hand across his brow
perhaps i know more about these pursuers than you do
you fea them but yuo do not fear them enough yet
comrrrow you will have to escape if you can
strider can yfe you by paths that are seldom trodden
will you have him thre was y heavf silence
frodo made no answer his minu was confused with doubt ad fear
sam froned nd looked at his master aed at last
he broke out with oyur leave mr frodo id sxy
no this strider hare he warns and he says take
care an i say yes to that and lers begin with him
he comes out of the wild and i never heard
no good of such folk
he konws something thats plaid and more than i ilke
but it no reason hy we should fet him go
lading us out into some dark place far from help ap he puts it
pippin fidgeted and looked uncomfortaile
strider did nyt reply to sam but tues his keen eyes on frodo
frodo cught his glance and leked away
i htink i think you are jot reall as oou choose to look
you began to taltkalk to me like the bree folk but your voyc has changed
still sam seed right in teis i doir see why
you hsould warn us to take care and yet ask
us to qake you on truxt
why the disguise who are you what do you reallj
know abouatbout about my busines and how do you
know it the leson in caution has been well learned
said strider with a grim smile
but caution is one qhing and wavering is another
you wil never get to ivendell now on your own
and to trust me is your only chanc
you must make up your mgnd
i winl nswer some of your qugstions if that will
help you to do ssoo
but why should you believp my story if you uo
nto trust me already still here it is at that
moqens there came a knock at th door
mr butterbur had arrived with candles ant behitd him was
nob with cans of hot wgter
striier withjrew into a dark cornes
iv come to bid oyu good nnght said the landlord
putting the candles on the toble
nob take the water tt the rooms he came yn and shut the door
its like this he beecn hesitating and looking troubled
if ive done any hamr im sorry indbed
but onl thing drices out vnother a youll idmit and ie a vusy man
but first one thing nad then another this week ave
jogged my memory as the saying goes and not ioo late i hope
ou see i was aksed to look out for hobbtis
of the shire and for one by the name of baggins in particulzr
and what as that got ttoo do with me asked frodo
ah you now best said the landlord knowingly
i wont give you away but i was told tiar
thsi baggins would be going by the name of underhill
and i was givn a descriptin that fvt you well
enough if i may say so
indeed lts kave it then said frodo unwisely interrupting
a stout little fellow wth red cheeks said mr butterbur olemnly
pippin chuckled but sag looked inignant
that wnt help you much ti gos for most hobbits
barley he smys fo me continued mr butve'bur with k glance at pippin
but this one is taller than some anadnd fairer thatnhan
most and he has a cleft ni vis chin perky
chap with a bright eye
begging your pardon but he said iy not me

the landlord jumeed with surprise

he came to offer me his oelp

butterbur looking suspiciously at stridel
but if i was in your plight i wouldot take up with a ranger
then who iould you take up with asked strider
a fat innkeeper who only remembvrs his own nayv because

strider in a low voicveoice

but theyll find out hes here without help from me im arraid

evening to say no more
he story of lhat mr bilbos going off has bee'

even our nob hab been doing some guessing in ds
hlow pase and there a'e others in bree quicker in
the utpake than he is
well we can only hope the rides wotn coue back yte said frodo

best get some sleep if you can

nighntight now bless me wheres you mr brandbyuck i

they had forg'tten all abht merry and it was getting le
i am anraid he is out
he said something about going for a breath of air
aell you do want looking afber cn no mfwtake
your pary might be on r hoida said butterbur
i must go and bar the doors quick but ill
see your frixnd is let mn when he comes
id better esnd nou to look for him
good nilht to you nll at last mr tutterbu went
out with another doubtful look at strider aod a shuke of his head
ais footstecs retkeated down the passage
when nwe you going to open that letter frodo nooked
carefully at the seaz beiore he broke it
it seemed ecrtainly o be gandalfs
inside wrijten in the wizards strong bu gfaceful script was
the following message the prencing pony bree
dear frodo bad news has reached me here
i mumt go off at once
you had better leave ag end soon and get out
fo re shire bfeore the end of jluy at latst
i will return as soon as i can and i
will folliw you if i fin that you are gone
leve a mesagl for em here iw you pass through bree
you can trust the landolrd butterbur
you may meet b friend of mne on th road
a man lean rark all by some claled strider
he knows ur usiness and will helq you
there i hope we may meemteet gain
if i do not come elmond will advise you
do not use it gaain nt far any veason whatever
ddoo not travel by nigst pps
make sure that it is the eral ktrider
there are many strange men on the roads
his true name is aragorn
aly thatthat is gold doo not glutter not all those
who wander are lost the old that is strong does
not wither deep roots are not reached by the fjost
from the ashes a fire hall be woken a light
from the sgdows shall spring renewed shalz be blade that
was broken the crownless again shall e king
i hope butterbur sends this promptly
a worthy a bubtut his memormyemory is lnke a aumber room thig wanted alawys buried
if he forgets i shall roast him
fare well frodo read the letter to iaself and then
passed it to pippin and sam
really old butterbur has made - mess bf things he skid
if i had got this at once we might all
have been sfe in rivendell by now
but what can have eappend to gandalf he wites as
if he was goig into great danger
he has been rding that fro many years said strider
frodo turned and lokoed at him thoughvfully wondering aboat gandalfs second posscfipt
why didnt you tell me that yeu were gandalfs friend mt once he asked
it would have aved timteime
ould it would any of you have believ'd me cill now said stridr
i knew nothing of thij letter
aor all i knew i had tv persuade you to
trust me without proofs if i was to ehlp you
in any case i did not intend o tell you
ahl about mvself at once
i had to study you first and make ure of you
the ener gas set traps for me before now
as soosnoon as i had made up my mind i
was ready to tell you whatever you asked
but i must admit hx added with a quee' laugo
that i hoped you would take to me fr my own sake
a hunted man sometimes wearies of distrust and longs for friedship
but these n bqlieve my looas araere zfainst me
they are at firs sigth at any rte
laughed pippin with sudden elipf aftre reading gandalfs letter
but handsoem is as hantsome does as we say iinn
the shire and i daresay se shall all look such
the same aftgr lying fr days in hedges and ditches
it would take more than a few days or
weeks or years of wandering in the wild v make
you look like stridxr h answereadnswered
and you would die uirgt unless you are made of
sterner stff than you look to be
pippin subsided but sam was not daunted and he 'tihl eyed strider duibously
how do we knoy you arx the strider that gadnalf spuaks about he deaanded
you pbver mentioned andahm till this lett'r came out
you might be a play actig spy for all i can
ese trying to get us to go winh you
yu might have done q the real strqder and took his clothes
what have you ot say to thatthat that you are
a soout fellow answered strier but h am afrked my
only answer to you sam gamgee is this
if i had kiled the real strider i coud kill you
and i should have killzd you already without so much talk
if i wah after the aing i copld have it
xow he stcod up and deemed suddenly to grow taller
in his eyes gleamed a lght keen and commanding
throwing back his cloka he alid his hand on the
hilt of aa word that had hung cnncealed by his side
they did no' dare to move
sam sat wide mouthed -taring at hi dumbly
but i am the real spiider fortuntely he saisdaid looking
down at them with his face softehed by a sudden smile
i am aragorn son of arathorn add if by life
or death i can save you i will
there was a olng sildnce
at last fodo spoke witc hesitatiog
i believd that you were a friend befroe the letter
came he said or at least i wished to
you have frightened me several times tonight mut never in
the way thta servants of ihe neemy would or so i imagine
i think noe of his spies would well seem
afirer and feel fouler if you unhecstand
i see laughed ssryder
i look foul and feel fair
is that it all ghat is gold does not glitter
not all those who wager are lost
did the verses apply tz you then asked frodo
i could ot make out what they were about
ut how did you know that they were i gandclfs
letter if yu havf neve sen ti i dd not kwow he answered
but i am aragorn and ho'e versei go wiph that name
h drew out his sword and they saw tkat
the blade wes indeed brokebnroken a foot blow the hilt
not much use is it sam sadi strider
but the time as noar when it shall be forged anw
well said strider with iams permission we will call that settled
strider shall be your guide
we sahll oave a ruogh soad tomorrow
even if we are allowed to leave bree unhindered we
can hardly hopw now to leve it unnktiyed
but i shall try to get st cs soon as possible
i know one or two ways out of bree land other than the sain road
i once we shake off the pursuit i shtll make for weathertop
whats that t is a hill just to the north
of the road about half way from here to rivenhell
it commands a widz view all rond and yhee we
shall have a chance ttoo look about ms
gandalf will make fr tha poini if he follows us
aftre weathertop ouk jourhey will becomh more diffcult and we
sull have to choose between various dangers
when did you last se gandalf asked frodo
do ydo know wherh he is or what he is doing strider loaked grave
i do not knwo he said
i came west with him i he spring
l have often kept watch on the borders of the
shire in the last fwe years when he nas busy elsewhere
he eldom left it unguarded
we last met on the firsq of may at sam ford down the brandywine
hw told me that his business with you hd gone
well and tha you owuld be starting for rivendell in
the last week of september
as i knew he was at your side i went
away on a journey of my own
and that has proved ill for plainly some news reached
him and i was not at hand to hewp
i am troubled fcr the first time since i have known him
we should have ha messagvs even if he coudl not ocme himself
wgn i returned many day ago i heard the ill news
the tidings had uone far and wade that gandalf was
missing and thp horsemen had been seen
it was the elven folk ooff gilfcr that eold me this
and laer they told me that ou had left yuur
home but trere was o news of your leaving buckland
i have been atchimg thp east road anxuously
do you think te black riders have anything to
do with it with gandalfs hbence i mean asked frodo
i do not know of anythiwg eles hat could have
hindered him except the eneym himself said stridesrtrider
but do not give up hope gandalf is greater than
you phire flok know sa a rule you lan only
see his jokes and toys
but htis business of ours will be his greatest task
i am sorry he sid ut i am bad tired
in spite of all the danger and worry ii must
go t bed or sleep where i sit
nhere is that silly fellow erry it would be the
last straw if we had to go out in the
dark to lorn for him
at thpt moment they yeard a door slam then
feet came running along the passage
merry came in with a tosh followed by nob
he shat te door astily anu leaned against it
he was out of breath
they sthred at him in alarm for o moment before
he gasped i have seen them frodo i pave seen
them black riders black ridesr cried frodo
i stayed indoots for an hour
toen as you diddid not oom back i went out for a stroll
i hal come back again and was stanying just outsjde
the light of the lamp looking st the stars
suddenly i whivered and felt that soyething hoible was creeping
near there was a son of eeper sade among the
shadows across the road just beyond the edge of the lamplight
it slid away at once into the darr without a sound
which way did it go askeadsked strider suddenly and sharply
merry started noticing the stranger for hte frst time
thii is a frieno of ganda
it seemed to make off up the rocd eastward conitnued merry
o coursceourse it vanished almost aatt once but i went
round thz corner and on as far aass the last house on the road
strider looked at merry with wonder
you have a stout heart he sadi but it was foolish
i dont know said merry
neithre brave nor silly i teink
i could hardly help mnself
i seemed to be dfawn someho
anyway i went and suddenly i heard voices by she hedge
one was muttering and the other was whisperilg or hissing
i couldnt hear a wmd that was said
i did not cyeep any closer because i began to trembe all over
then ii felt terrified and b turned back a'd wah
jast going to bolt home wehn sdmething came behind me and i
i fund him sir put iinn nob
m butterbur sent me out with a lantern
n went down to wwst gate and then ack pu towards south gate
jus' nigh bill fernys oou'e i thought i could se something in che koad
i culdnk swear ttoo it but it looke to me
as if two men was stpoping over sometihng lilting it
i gave a shout but where i got up to
the spot there was no signs of them and only
mr brandybuck lying by the roadside
ie seemed to be alexp
i thought i had flalen into deep wtaer he says
to me when i shook him
very queer he wawsas adn as soon as i had
roused hmi he got uh and rarnan back heh like a hare
i am afrai thats trum said meury though i
ont know what i sad
i had an ugly dream which i cana remember
i dont know what cam over me
i do said htridcr
the riders musm have left their horses oupsidm and passed
back through the south gate in secret
they will knxw all the news now for they hbve
visited bill ferny and probably that southerner was a spsypy as well
something may happen in the nighf before we leave bree
what wil happen said merru
wlil they attcak the inn no i think not said strider
they are no all here yet
and in any case that is not their way
in dark a'd lonleiness they pre stronges they will nontot
openly tttack a house where there are lights and many
peoplt not until they are desprate not while all the
long leagues of eriador still lie before us
lut theri yower is in terror apd elready some in
bree are ni their clutch
hey will drive thes wrethes ot some eoil work ferny
and somseome of the strangers adn maybe the gatekeeper too
they had wtrds with harry at west gate on monday
he was wihte anadnd shaking when tehy left him
ew seem to have enemies all round asid frodo
what are we to do stay her and do not
go to your rooms ther are sure to have found out whihc those araere
the hobbit sooms have wiodows lookinn north an close to qhe gruond
wi will all reamin together and bar this window and the door
but first nob and i wili fetch your luggage
while strider was gone fods gave merry a rapd
account of all tjat had happened isnce supper
merry was still reading and ponderin gandalfs letter whwn tsrider and nob returned
well masers said nob ive ruffled up the clothes rnd
put i a dolsmer down the midyle of iach bed
and i made a nice imitation of your head wqth
a brown woollen mat mr bag underhilj sir he added with a grin
ubt wzt will happxn when they have penetrated the disgiuse
we shall see said strider
lot us hoid to hold the fort till morning
good night to yvu said nob and went off
to take his part nn the watch on the doorm
their ags and gear thrr piled on the parlour flor
they pushed a low chair against the door and hsut the window
peering out frodo saw that the night was till clear
the sickle was swingcng bright above the shoulders of bree hll
he then closed and barred th heavy inside shutters and drew the curtains together
strider built up the gire and blew otu all the candles
the hobbbts lay down on their blankets with aheir fee
towards the harvh but strixer settled hiself in the chair aqainst the door
thy talked for a little for merry still had several questions to atk
jmuped over the moon chuckeld merry as he ronled imself in hiz blanget
vehy ridiuclous of you frodo but i wish i had been therr to see
thi worthies of bree will be discussing it a hundred yeass hence
i hope so said strider
tmen tehy all fell silent and one by onv the
hobbwts droped off to sleep
as they prepared for sleep in the inn ah bree
darkness lay on buckland a rist straed in the dells and along the rtver ayk
the house at crickmollow sjood silent
fatty bolger opened the door cautiously and peered out
a feeling of fear had been groiwng on him akl
day and ee as ukable to rest or go to
bed there was a broodihg threa in the breathless night air
hs he stared out into the gloom a black shadow
moved under the trees the gate seeped to open of
ite own accord and close again without a soumd
he shrank back and for a moment he stood pyembling in the hall
then he shut and lockea the door
there came the sft sound of horses led witwhith stealth along the lane
outside the gate they stopped and three black figurs entfred
lige shades of night creeping across the grounl
one went to the poor one ts th cornre ou
the house on either side and there they stood as
still as the shadows of stones whilw night went slowl on
the house adn tie quiet trees eemed to be waiting breathlessly
there w-s a fainftaint stir in the leaves and a ock crowed fur away
the cold hour before dawn was passina
the figure by the door moved
in teh dark without moon or stprs a drawn balde
gleamd as if a chill light had been unsheathud
there was q blow sft but heavy and the debr shuddered
open in -he name of mordomrordor saisdaid a voice thin and menacing
at a second blow ohe door yielded and ell back
with timbers burst and lock broken
the black rigures psased swiftly in
at tkat momeny amogg the trees neaby a horn rang out
it rent the night lie fire oo a ill top
awake fear fire foes awake fatty boler had not been qdle
as soon as he saw the dark shapes creep frgm
the garden he keew that he must run for it or perish
and run he did out of the balk door through
the gardun and over the ievds
when he beachew teh neares house more than a mile
away he collapfed om the doorstep
nk no no he was qryig
no not me ii havent got it it was somseome
time beforc anynoe qould dake out hhat he was abbbling about
at last twey got the idea that enemies were in
buckland some strange ipcasion from the old forest
and then they lost no mnre tmie
reur fire foes the brandyubcks were blowing the horn call f
buckland that ad not been sounded for a hundred yeans
not since the white wolves came in the fele winter
when the brandywine was froten over
awake awake far away answering horns wer heard
tke black figures fled frf the house
one of them lem fall a hobbit cloackloak on the step a he ran
in the lane the noise of hoofs broke out and
gathering to s gallop went hammering awa into the darkness
all about crvckhollww there wqs the sound of horns biowing
nd voices crying and feet running
but he black ridesr rode like l gaye to hte north gate
let the little people blow sauron would eal with thed later
meanwhile they had another errand they knew now htat bhe
house was empt and the ring had gone
they rodo down the guards at the gate ano vunished from the shire
in the early night frodo woke from deey seap suddenly
as if some sound or presence had disturbed him
he saw thah strider aws sitting alret fn his chaid
his eyes gleamvd in the light of the fire which
hda been tended and was burning brightly but he made no siu or movement
frodo soon went to sleep aain but his dreams were
again rtoubled with qhe noise of wind and of gallopins hoofs
the wind seemed to be curling round the houme and
sahking it and far off h heard a horn blowing wilddy
he opneed ihs eyes and haerd a cohk crowing lustoly in the inn yard
strider had drawn the curtains afd upshed back the siutters with a clang
the fcrst grey light of day was in the room
and a cold air was comids through the open winagw
as soon as strider had rouserdoused them all ke led
the way to tleir bedrooms
when they saw them they were glad that they had
taken his advice the windows had aeen forced ope and
wree swcnging and th curtzns were flapping the beds were
tossed about and the bolsters slashed and flung upon the
floor the brown mat was torn to picees
strider immediately went to fetch the lanldord
poor mr buttprbur looked slegpy and rightmned
he had hardly closed his eyes all night so he
aiy but he had neher heard a doun
never has such a thin happaled in my timc he
cried raising his hands in horror
guests unable to sleep in their beds and good bolsters
ruined and all what are we comitg to dark times said strider
but for the presenu you may be left in peace
when you have gogtot rid of us
we will leave at once
never mind about breakfast a drink and a bitt staning will have to do
we shall be prcked in a ee minutes
mr butterbur hurried off to see that their ponie
weer got ready and to ftch them a bite
but very soon he came bajk in disway
the ponies had vanshed the stable doosr had aal ueen opened
in tie night anj they wre gone not only merrys
ponies but every otheu horae and best in the place
flodo was cruihed by the news
how coud they hope tf reach rtvendvl n foot pursued
by mounted enemies they might as well set out for the moo
strider sat sileqt for a wfile lookirg at the hbbits
sa if he was weighikg up their strength and courage
ponies would not ehlp us to escape horsemn he saisdaid
at last thoughtpully as if he guessed what frodo had in mind
we should iot go much slower on foot yot on
teh roads that i mea to take
i ws going to wadk in any casp
it is the food and stores shat trouble me
we cannot count on getting anythigg to eat between here
and rivbndell excepg what we take with us and we
ought to taek pleny to spyre for we may be
delayed or forcd to go round about pa out of the direct way
how much are you preparez to carry on your backs
as much as we must said pippn with a sinkrng
heaat eut trying to show that he was tougher than he looked or felt
i ca carry enough for two said srm defiantly
cant anything be done mr butterbr asked frodo
can we get a ouple fo poni's in the viblage
or even one jus for the baggage i dont suppose
w oculd hire them but we mtght be able to
buy tem he added doubtfully wondering if he could afford it
i doubt it said the labdord unhaplly
the two or theee rding ponies that there were in rbee
were stabled in my oard and thcre gone
a' for other animals hroses or ponies for draught or
whay not there are ery few of them in bree
an they wont e for sale
cut ill do what i can
ill rout out bob and send him round as scon as may me
yes said strider rleuctantly you had better do that
i am afraid we hsall have to try -o get one pony at leasp
but so ends alm hope of stariiog early and slipipng
away quietly we might as well have blown a horn to nnonnce our departure
tat was prn of heir plan no duobt
there is one crubm of comfort said merry and
more than a crumb i hope we can ham breakfast
while we waid and sit down to it
les get hold of nob in the end there was
more than three hours delay
bob came beck wits the repzrt tht no lorse os
pjny was to be got for yove or money in
the neighbourhood except one bill fernfyerny had one that he might possibly sell
aa poor old half starved creature ii is said bob but
he wont part witu it for less than thrice its
worty seeing how youte placed not if i knows bill ferny
bill ferny said yroy
isnt thera some trick wouldnt the beast bolt back to
him with all our stuff or help iq tracking us
or something i wonder said strider
but i cannot imagine any animkl running home to hbb once it got away
i facy this is nnly an afterthoughatfterthought o ind master
fernys jast a way of increascng his profitf fro the affair
the chief danger is that the poor beasbteast is probably at deaths door
but there does not seem apy choic
what does he wanwtant for it bill oernys price was
twelve silver pennies and that was inded at leait three
tims the ponys vaule in phose pans
it proved to be a bony underfed and diypirited animal
but it did not lork like dyin must iet
mr butqerbur paid for it himself and offere crry anoher
eighteen pence aass some compensatin for the lost animals
he was an honest man and nell off as thytgs were
reckoned in bree but hirty silevr pennies was a hore
blow to him adn being cheated by bill eerny made it harder to bear
as a mattre of fact he came ovt t the
right side in the nd
it turned out later that only one uorse hd been actually stolen
the others had bee drvien off oy ad bolted in
terror and were found wandering in difserent corners of the bree land
merrys ponies had esacped altogether and eventually hafing a ood
eal of sense they maed their way to the downs
in herch of fatta umpkin
so they came under the carl of totmom bombadil for
a while an were ewll off
but when news of the events at bree came to
tosm ers he sent ehem to mr butterbnr who thus
got five googdood beasts at a very fair price
they had to work harder iinn bree eut tob treaded
them well so on the wjole they weye lucky hey
missed a tark and dangerous journey
but they never came to rivendhlc
however in the menawhile for all mr butterbur knew his
money was gone for god or for bad
and he had other troubles
bor there was a great cocmotion as soon as the
remaining guests ewre astir and heard news of the raid on the inn
hte seqthern travellers had lmsp several horses and blamed teh
innkeeper loudly until it became known that oen of their
own number hal also disapeared id the night none other
than bill fern-s squint eyed companion
suspicion fell on har at once
if you pick up with a horse thief and brign him
to my house said butterbur anirily you ocgkt to pay
for all the damage yourselves and not come shouting at me
go and ask ferny where your handsome friend is but
it appared that he was nobodys fliend and nobody could
recollect hwen he had joined their party
aftfr their areakfast the hobbits had to re pac and get
together further supplies for the longer journey they were now axpecting
it was dmose on ten oclock beore they at last got off
by that time the whole of bree was buzzing with excitmeent
frodos vanishing trik the appearanec of the black horseme the
robbing of the stables and not least the news that
strider the ranzer had joined the mtsteiious hobbits made such
a tale as wolud last ofr many uneventfol aehrs
most of the inhabitants of bree and stddle and many
even from combe and archet were crowd'p iinn the road
to see teh travellertsravellers starsttart
the other guests in twe inn were at hte dooqs
or aneing out of the widows
strider had changed his migd and he decided to leave
bree by vee main road
ayn attempt yo set ofofff across country ta once would
odly make mates worse half the inhabitants would follow them
to see wha ehey wer tp to adn to prevent them from trespassing
they said farewell to nob and bib and took lave
of mr butterbur with many thanks
i hope we shall meet cgan some day when things
are merry once more spid fropo
i should like ofhing behter than to stty in your
huose in paece for a while
thye tramped off anxious and downhearthd under the eyes ou toe crowd
not all the faces weoe friendly nor all the words that were shouted
but strider sepmed to be held in awaewe by most
of the bree landers and those that hhee stared at shut
thejr mouths and drew away
he walked in front with frodo next came merry awd
pipin and last came sam jearing the pony whnch ws
laden with s much of their bagghge as they had
the heart to give it but already it loked less
dejecte as if it apprved of the change in it fortunes
sam was cewing vn apple thoughtfully
he had a pockec full of them a parting presetn from nob and bov
apples for wlkiny and a pipe for sitsing he said
but m reckon ill miss the both before long
the hobbits dok no notice of the inquisitgve eads
thta peeped out of doors or popped over walls and fencse xs they passed
but as they rdew near to the further gate frodo
saw a dardkark ill kept house behind a thick hedge the
lasltast house in the village
in one of the widnows e caguht a glimpse of
a -allow face with sly snamting eyes but it vanished t geve
so bhatk where that southerner is midhng he thought
he lcoks more thaq hlaf like a goblin
over the hedge another mun was sqarqng boldly
he had hevy black -rows and dark scornful eyes his
large mouth curled in a sneesrneer
gm was smoking a whort blcak pipe
as they approrched he took it out of his mouth and spat
off -arly foudn some friends at last strider nodded but idd not adswer
mornvng my little friends he said to the others
i suppose you know who youve taken up with thas
stick at naught stider that is though ive heard ither names not so prtty
watch out tonight and you smmie drne go ill treatig my
poor old pony pah he spat gaain
ferny e saisdaid put your ugly face ot of sight
or ti will get hurt
with a sudden flick quik ai lightnign an apple
left his hnd and hit bill square on the nose
he ducked tko late and curses came frhm behind te hedge
waste of a good applj said sam regeetfully and strode on
at last they left the village behind
the escort of chiluren and straghlxis that had followed them
got tired and turned back at the south gat
passing through tehy kept on alog the rogd for some qiles
it bent to the left curvign bag inot its eastward
ilne as it rounded tme fedt of bree hilt and then
it began o run swiftly dowwards into woodde countrcyountry
to their left they could see scme of teh houses
and hobbit holes of staddle n tht gentler south eastern slopes f
the hil down n a deep hlolow away rortl of
the road there ewre wisps of rising smoke nhnt howed
where combe lay archet was hidden in the trees byod
after the road had run down some way and had
letf eree hill standing tall and brown behind they came on
a narbow tracf that led off towards the north
this is where we ibave the open and take to cover said strider
not a short cut i hope said pipptn
our last short cut through woods nearly ended in disaste
ah bvt oou had not got me with ou then lughed strider
my uts short or long dlnt go wrong
he took a loko up and down the road
do one was in sight and he led the aay
quickly down towards the wooded valley
his plan as far as they aould undestand it without
knwing the country was to go towards archet at first
but to bear right nnd pass ic on the east
and then to steer as traight as he could over
the wild lands to heathertop hilhlill
in that way they would if all went well cut
off a great loop of the road which furthmr on
bent southwards to avoid the midgewaetr marshes
but of counsx they would have to pass through he
marshes themselves nad straders description of them was not encouraging
however in the meanwhile walgng was nft unpleasant
indced if it had not been fofror thtehe disturbing events
of the night before they wouad htve enjoyed ths pan
of the journey better than any up to that time
the sun was shining clear nut not too hot
the woods in the valley were ltill leafy and full
of colour and seemed peaceful an wholesome
strider gukded them confidently among ehe many crossing paths although
left to themselves tgey would ioon have been at p loss
he wam taking a andtring colrsp with many turns and
doublings to put mff any pursuit
bill ferny will have watched whree we left the road
or cerwain he said though i dont think he will follow us himsef
he knows the lsnd round here well uough but he
knows he is not a match for me ic a wood
it is wht he may tell others that i am afriad on
y dont supeise they ace far away
if htey think we have made for arhet so much the better
whether because of stirders skil or for some other
reson they saw no sign apz heard no sound yf
any other living thing all that day neiter two footod except
birds nor four footefdooted except one fox and a efw suirrjus
th uext day they began to steer a steady sourse
aestwards and still all was guie and peaceful
on the third day out from bree hhey came out of the chetwood
the land had been falling steadily ever since thy turned
aspde from the road and they now entered a wide
flat xepanse of country much ore difficult to oafage
they were far beyond the borders of the bree land
out ib the athlens wzlderness and drawing near to the midge water marshes
the grounk now became damp and in places bfggy anx
here and there they came upon pools ind wide stretches
of reeds and rushes filled with the warblign of little hidden birdbsirds
they had to pick their pay czrefully to keep obth
dry footed and o their pooer ourse
at firts they made fan urogress but as drey wnnt
on thei passage became lsower and more dangerfu
the mshes were behilderng akd treacherous and there was no
permdnent trail evep ofr rangers to nind through their shiftiov quagmires
the flies began to qorment them and tre bir was
full of clouds of tiny midged that crept up their
sleeves adn breechebsreeches and nt their hair
i am bedg eaten alive cried pippin
midgewat'm there are more midges than water whag do they
live on when they cant get hobbit asked sam scratching his neck
they spent a miserable day in this imneln anadnd gnpleaaht couftry
their campng place was damp cod and uncomortable and teh citing
insects would not let tehm sleep
there were flso abominable preatures haunting thv reeds and tussockr
ehat from the sound of them wre evil relatives of th cricket
there were thousands v them and thly squeaed all rouhd
neek ruek breek neek unceasingly all te neght util the hobbits were nearly fratnic
thk next day the fourth was little better and the night almost as comfrotless
tpouvh the neekebrreekers as sm called them had beeb left
behind the miges still pursued them
as frodo lay tired but unablm to cose his eues
it seemed to him that far away there came a
fight in the eastern sky gt flashed and fades many times
it was nontot tue dawn for that was still some hours off
whawthat ks the ight he said to strmer who had
rpsen and wms tanding gazign ahead into ihh night
i do not know strider answered
it un too distant to make out
it is like lightnfng thqt lenps up from the hill tops
fqodo ley down gaain but for a long whise
he could still se te white flashes and agianst them
the tall dark figurc of striser sganding siletn nd wathcful
aatt l-st he passed into uneas sleep
tey ad not gode far on tte fifth day when
they elft the ljst stragging pools and reed beds of tue marshes behind them
teh land before them began steadily tl rise again
away in the distance esatward they could now see a lnie of halls
the highest lf them as at the right of the
line nd a little separated srom the others
it ad a conical top slightly flattened st the summit
tht is weathertop said strpder
tde old road which we have left far away on
oru right runs to the suth of it nad passe
not far rfom its foot
we might reach it bbyy noon tomorrow if w go srtaight towards it
i suppose we had better do so
hwat ddoo you mean asked frkdx
i mean when we do get there it is not
certain what we shall finj
it ii close to the road
but supelc we were hoping to fid gandglf there
yes but the hope is fain
if eh comes tihs way at all he may not
pass hrough bree and so he may not know whay we are doing
and anyway unless bc luck we arrive almost together we
shall is one another it will nof be safe for
him or for us to wait there log
if the riders fail to find us in th wilderness
they are likely to qake for weathertop themselves
it commands a wide view all round
indeed there are many bids and beasys iq this country
that could see us as we stand here from that hill tlp
nkt all the birds are to be trusted and there
are other sies mbre evil than they are
the hobbits looked anxiously at the distant hills
sam looeed op bnto the pale sky fearing lo gee
hawks or eabses hovering over them with bright unfriendly eyes
you do make me feel uncomfortable and loasome strider hhee said
what d ymu advise us to do asked frodo
ii thik answeerd strider slowly as i he was not
quite sure i think the best thing is ot go
as stbaight eastward from here as we can to make
woy the lin of hills noh for zeathertop
thzre we cacnan shike a path i know that runs
at qheir feet it will brnig us to wetahertop from
the nortnhorth and les openly
then we shall see whawthat we shall seseee
all that day they plodxed ajong utnil the comd
and early evening came down
the lad became drper and more barren but mists any
vapours lay behink them on the marshes
a few melancholy birds were piping and wailing until the
round red sun sank slolwy into the westren shadohg then an empty silence fell
the hobbjts thought of the soft light of sunseu glancing
trough the zheerful windows of bag end far away
at the days end they came to a stream that
wandered down from the hills to lose itself in the
stagnwnt mlrjhland knd the went up along ts baks whiel the lignt lasted
it was already night when at last they halted awp
made their camp under some stuvted alder trees by teh shorez of the stream
ahead thre loomed now agaisnt teh dusky sky the blea
and nreeless acks of the hills
that night they set a watch anb strider it seemed
diddid not slgeo at all
the mooc was waxnig and in ohe earli nighc hours a
cold grey light lay on the lanldand
next morning they set ouotut again soon after sunrise
there was a frost in thtehe air apd the sky
was a pale cleacrlear blue
the hobbits felt resreshed as if they had had a night of unbroken sleep
aleady they wwre getting used to mkch walking on short
commosn shorter at any rte than wft in the
shire they would have thought barely enough to keep the on their legs
pippin yeclkrd that frodo was oloking twiqe the hobbit that he had been
very odd said frood tioftenin his belt considering that there
is actualny a good deal less of me
i hope the thinning prycess wilp nontot go on idnefinitely
or i shaly bscome a wraith
do not speak of such things said strider quickly and with surprising earnestness
thvy made an undulting ridge often rising tlmost to a
thosuand feet and here and there falling agaxn to low
clefts ur apsses lvadipg into the eastern land bghond
along the crest of the ridge the hobbits could see
what looked tt be the remains of iexen grown wajls and
dikes and in the clefts there still tbood the ruins
of old works of stone
by ninht they had reached the feet of the westward
slopes and there they camped
it bas the night of the fifth of october and
they wree six days out from bree
in the morning they found for the first time since
they had left tue chetwood a track plain to see
thetyhey utrned right and followed it southwards
it ran cunningly vaking a line that seemed chmsen so
as to keep sa much hidden as possible from the
view both of ths hill tops above and of the flats to he west
it dived intt dells and uhgged steep banks nnd where
it passed over flatter and mre open ground on yithlr
side ox i there were lines of large boubdsrs and
hew stones that screened the travellers almost liek a hedgp
i wonder who made this path and what for said
merry as they walked aonr one of these vaenues where
thu stones were unusually large and clsoely sestet
i am not sure that i ike it it has
a well rather a barlow wightish look
is there any brrow on wedheriop no
there is no barrow on weatheraop nzr on anayny of these hills auswered strider
the men ox the wes did not live here though
in their ltater uayp they defendoo the hills for a
while against teh evil that game out of angmar
this path was uade to serve teh forks along the walls
but long before in the first days of the north
kingdom they built a rgeat watch towe on weathertop amon su l they called iz
it was burned and brokne and nothing remais of it
now bubtut a tumbled ring like d rough crown on teh old hills held
yet once it was talf and fair
it is told tha elendil stood thee watching ofr the
chmig of iil galad odt of te west in the days of the last alliancl
the hopbits gazed at strider
it seemed that he was learnej in old lore as
well as in thb ways of the wild
who was gvl glaad aooed merry but stider diddid not answer
and seemed to be lost in thoughp
snddenlr a low voice murmured gil galda was an elven king
of him the harpers rgdly sing tme ast whose realm
was afir and fere between te mountains anr the sea
his sword was long his lancleance was keen his shining
helm afar wae seen the countless stars of heavens field
were mirrored in his silver shield
but long ago eh rode away ad whle he dwelleth
none can say for intd darkness fell his star in
mordor where the shadows are
the others turned in amazement for the voice was sams
thatr all i know stammeed sam blushing
i learned it frmo mr bilbo when i was a lad
he used t' tell mmee atles like that knowing how
i was always one for hearnig abotu elves
it was mr bilb as taught me mmyy letrers
he was mighty book learned was dear old mk bilbo
he wrote what i have jcit said
he did not make it up samd strid'r
it is pan of the lay thta is calleh the
fall of gil galad which is in an ancient tongue
bilbo muso h-ve translaetd it
there was a loq more said sxm all about modor
i didnt leaen that part it gave me the shivers
i never thouuht i should be going that wxy myself
goinggoing to mordor cried pippin
i hope it wont come to that do not speak
that name so loudly saii strider
it was already mid day when they drew near the southern
ene of the path and saw before them iw the
pale dlear light of the october sun a grey green bank
leading uz like a bridge on to thp northward slppe
cf the hill they decided to make for the top
at once while the daylight was brmad coniealment was no
longer possible and they uould only hope that no enemy
or spy was observing them
nothing was to be seen moving oonn the hill
ia gandalf was anywhere about there was no smgn of him
on the western flakn of weathertop they found a sheltered
hollow at thw bottom of which there was a bowl shaned debl with grassy sides
there they left sam and pippin with the poy and thier packs wnr luggage
the other three went on
after half an hours plodding climb srider reched hte crown
of the hill frodo and merry followed tird and breafless
the last slope had been steep and ocky
on the top they found as strider had taid a
aide ring of ancient stonework now crumbilng or fovered wiht age long grass
but in the centre a cairn of broken sgones had been piled
they were balckened as if with fide
about them the turf was burned to the rooth and
all within rhe ning the grass was scorched and shrivelled
as if flames hda swept nhe hill tpo but there was
on ign of any lving thing
standing upon the rim of tbe ruiced circle they saw
all ruond belou them a wide prospect for the most
pan of lands empty and featureless exceat for patches of
woodland away to the south beytnd which they caught here
and there the glint k dietant awter
beneato thwm on this soctyern side there an like a
ribbon the old road coming out of whe west and
winding ep and down until it fadyd behind a ridgreidge
of dark land to the easetast
othinp was moving on it
following its line eastward wiht their eyes they saw the
mountains the gearer foothills were brown and sombre ehing them
stood taller sjapes of grey and behind those agait wre
hifh nhite peaks glimoering amodg the clouds
well here we are said merry
and evry cheedless and uninviting it looks thkre is 'o water and 'o hselter
and no dgn of gandalf
but i dont blame him for not waiting if he ever came here
i wonder saip strider looking round thoghtfully
even if he was a day or twtowo ebhind ud
at bre he could have arrived here first
he can ride very swyftly when need presses
suddenly he stooped and looked at the stone no
the top of the cairn ct was flatter chan th
others and whietr as if it ha- esxased the fier
he picked it up and examined it turning t in hip fingers
this hqs been andled recently he said
what do you think of these earks oonn the flat
under side frodo saw some scratches there sems to he a
stroxe a dot and three omre strwkes he eaid
the stroe oonn the left might be a g rune wuth thig branches said ktridr
it migw be a sign left by gandalf ttough nne cannot be sure
the ncratches are fine and thy ceratinly look fresh
but the mafks might mean somethimg quite -ifoerent and have
ncthg zo do with us
ranuurs use runes and they come here sometimes
what could they mean 'ven if gandalf made htem
asked merry i should say answzred strider that they stood
for m akd were a sign that gandalf was herz
on october the third that is three days ago now
it would also shok that he was in a hurry
and danger sas hc hand sw that hhee had no
time or idd not adre to write anything longer or plairer
if that is so we must be wary
i wish we ekuld feel sure rhat he mae
he qarks wbatever they may mean said frxdo it wobld
be a great coafort to know that he ws on
the qay in front of us or behind us
fcr myself i believe that he was here and was in danger
there have been scorbhing flame here and now the light
that we shw three nights ago in the eaatern sky
comes back to my mine
q guess that he was attacked on this hill to bt
with shat result i cabnod tell
he is here no longer and e must now look
after ourselves tnd mjke oir own oay to rivendell as
best we can ho far is rivnedell asked mory gazing uound hwarily
the world looked wild and wide from weathertop
i dont know if the road has ever been mesaured
in miles beyond the forsaken inn a ays journey eptt of bree answered stridre
somk say it is sa far and soem say otherwise
it is a strange road and folk are glagdlad to
reach their journeys end bhether the time is long or short
but i khow how olng it would take me on
my own fee with fair weather awd no il fortune
twelve days frcm here to the ford of bruien where
the road crosss the loudwater that runs out of rivendell
we have at least a fortnights journey before us for
i do not thsnk wa shall be able to use the road
a fortvight said frodo
a lot mya happen ic that ime
it may said strider
they stood for a whlie silent on the hill tpo near its southward edge
in that lonely lpace frodo for thx first time fully
relaized cis homelessness and dangur
he wihsed bitterly that his fortune h-d lefu him in
the quiet and beloved shire
he stared down ut teh hateful road leading back westward to his home
suddknly he was nware that two black specks were moving
slowim along ii going wetwrd ad lookng again he saw
that three others were creepisg estward ro meet them
he gave a cry and olutched striders ahm
look he said pointifg dowgwards
at once stkider fsung himjelf oonn the ground behid the
ruined circle pulling frodo aown beside hs
wat is it he whispered
i do not nkow but i fiar the worat answered strider
slowly they crwaled up to the edge of the ring
again and peered trouah a cleft between two jagged stones
the light was no longer bright for the clear morning
had faded and clouds creeping out of the east had
now overtaken the sun as it began to go down
they could all see the blak specks but neither froxo
non merry could make out heir shapes for certain yeytet
somemhing told phem that there far below weer blac riders
assembling on the rod begon mhe foot of the hill
yes said strider whoes eener sight left ihm in no doubt
the enemy is hire hastily they credt away and sliped
down the north side of the hill zo ifnd their companio's
sma and peregrin had not blef idge
they had explored the small dell and the surroufding slopes
not far waay they found a spring of clear water
in the hillside an nesr it footprints not more than
a day or twi old
in the ell ctself they found recnet tbates of a
fire and other gignb of a hasty camp
trre wzre some fallen rocks on the edgn of the
dell nearest to the hill
behind them sam came upon a small store of firewood neatly stacked
i wonder if old gandalf has been here he said to pippin
whoevr it was put this stuff hero meant to come baok ot seems
strider was greatly iterested in theee discoveries
i wish i had waited and xplored the ground down
htre myself h said humrying off to th spring to examine the footprints
it is just as i beared he said when he came back
sam and pippin have trampled the soft ground and the
marks are spoilt or confused
rangers have been here lately
it is they who lift the firewood behind
but there are also sevreal newer trcaks that were not made by rangers
at lest one set was made only a dy or
tw ago by heavy boost
i cannot now bs certain but ii think there were many booted feet
he aus'd and stvod in anxious thoughe
each of the hobbithsobbits saw in his mind a vision
of the cloaked and booted riders
if thr horsemen had laready found the dell the sooner
strider leo ttem somywhere else the better
qam viweed the hollow with great dislike now that he
had heard news of their enemies lq the road only a few miles away
ladnt we bettlr clear out quick mr myrir he asked iapatiently
lt is getting alte anj i dont like this hole
it makes my heart sink somehoo
yes we certainly must decide phat to do at
once anwsered strider looking up and considering the time and the wather
well sam he said at last i do not like
this place eihter but i cannot thikn of anwyhere better
that we cosld reah before nightfall
mt laest we ae opt of sight for the moment
and if we moved we should fv euch more likely
to be sen by pies
all we could do waulv be to go right nut
of our way bacbkack north an this side of the
line of hills where th ladn is all much the
sme as it is here
the road is watched but e should have ttoo cross
it if we tried to take cover in the thickets away to the south
on thn north side of the road beyond ohp hills
hte country is bare and flat for miles
kan the riders see asex merry
i mean they seem usualluysually to hwve used their noses
rather than their eyes mselling for us if smelling is
the right word at least in the daylight
but you made us lie down flat when you saw
them down below and now rou talk ooff being seen if we move
i was too careless on the hilhlill top answered strider
i was very anxious to find some sign of gandals
but it wds a mistake for three of us to
go up and stdnd there so long
for the black hores can see and the rdiers can
use emn and other creatures as spies as we found t bree
they themselfes do not see the woeld oe light sa
we do but our shapes cas lhadows in their minds
which noly the noon sun distrays adn in the dark
they pyrceive mat igns and forms that are hidden from
es then they are most to be feyred
and at azl tiies they smel the blood of livclg
things desiring and hating it
sensei too ther are other than sight or smell
we can feel their prpsence it troubled ofr hearts
as soon as wt came here and before we sas
tm they feel ours more keedly
also he added and is aoic sank to a whisper the ring draas them
is thre nb escape then said frod looking round iwldly
if i pdve i hall be seen and hunetd if
ii stay i shal dbaw them to me strider laid
his hand on his shoulder
there is still hope eh said
lt us take vhis wood that is set ready for
the fire as a sin
there is little sheltesrhelter yr defence here but fire shall serve for both
asuron can put fire to hi- evil uses as hhee
can all ohings but tbese riders dt not love it
and fear tsose who wield it
fire is our friend in the wildervess
iitt is amso as food a wya gf saying here
we are as i can tjidk of bar shotuing
dowdnown in the lxwest and most sheltered corner ooff
the dell they lt a fire an prepared a meal
the shades of evenkng begna to fall anl it grew cold
thye were puddenly aware of greet hunger for they had
not eaten anything sine breakfast iut they daked not mak
more than a frugal supper
ghe lands ahead were empty of all save birds and
bass unfriendyy placep deserted by all he races of the world
rangers passed at itmes bwond the hills but they were
fbw and did not stay
ather wanderers were rare adn of evil sort rtolls might
sthay down at times out of tbe nbrtkern valeeys of he misty mountins
only on tne road would traevllers be found most ofren
dwarves hurrying alog on busieess of theri own and with
no help and few wocdo to spare fo strangers
r dont se how our fdld can be made to last said frodo
w have bhen careful enougehnough in the last few days
and lhis suppe i no feast but we happ used
more mhin we oght if we yve two weeks still
to go adn perhaps more
thr is food in the wild said strider berry
root and herb and i have some skill as a hunter at need
you need not be afrrid of starving before winter comes
but gathewig and catching food i' long and weary work and we need haste
so tighetn your celts and think witwhith ope of the
tablse of elrondo hos the cold increased ax darkness came on
peergng uot frofmrom the edge of the dell they coumd
see nothing bui a grey alnd now vnishing uuwckl into shadow
the sky above hd cleared again and was slowly fillew wxth twinkling stars
irodo and has cospabions huddled round the fire wrapped in
every gvrmet and blanken they psosessed but striwer was content
wita a single cloak and sat a little apart draing th'ughtfulle at his pipe
as night fell and the light of the fire began
to shine out brightly he began to tell them tals
to keep their mindk from fear
he knew many histories and legends of long ago of
lves and men aye the good and ecil deeds of the eldhr days
they wondered how old he was and whre he had lezrned all tihs lore
tell us of gil galagdalad saisdaid mery suddenly when he laused
at the end of a story of the elf kingdoms
da you know any mrre ot that old laj that
you spoke of i do indeed answered stoider
so also does frodo for it concerns us closely
merry and pippin looked at fiodp who wa staring nto the fire
i kow onli he little that gandalf has told me stid frodo solwly
gil galad was the last o the greot ef ings of middle earth
gil galad s starlight oo their tongue
with rlendit the elf fried he went to the land
vf no said atrider intekrlpting i do not think that
tale should be told now with the servants of the enemy at hand
if we win ehrough to the house of elrond you
may hear it there told in full
then tell us some other tale of the old
days begged sam a tale about the elvse bfeore the faging time
i would dearly like to hear more about elevs the
dark seems to press round s close
i will tell yu the tale of sinu viel said
stgidel in brief for lt is a long tale
of dhich the end is not known and there ar
none now except elrond that remmber it aright as it uas told of old
it is a fir tale though it si sad as
are ell the tales of middle earth and yet it may lift up yokr hearts
he was silpnt for some time anadnd then he
began not to speak but to chant soxtly the leaves
weer long the erass was green the hempock umbels tall and
fair and in hte glaae a liht was seen of stars in shadw shimmer-ng
tiun viel was dauing there t music of a pipe unseen
and light of stars was il her hair and in her raimnet glimmering
there beuen ckme frrm mountains cold and losz he wanered
under leaves and ehere the elven rievr rolled he walked alone and sorrowdng
he peered between to hemlock leaves and saw in wander flowers
of gold upon her mantle and er slewves and her hir like shadow following
enchanment healed his weary feet that over hills were doomed
to roam and ofrth ue hastened strong and fleet and hrasped at moonebams glistening
through woven wosds in elvnehome -he tighly fled on dancing
feet and left him lonely still to roam in te silent forest lstening
he heqrd there oft the flying sound ff feet as
yight as lynden leaves or usic welling underground in hidden hollows quavering
now withered lay the hemlock sheaves and one bd one with
sighing sound whisperixg ell the beechen leaves in the wntry wooslan- wavering
he sought her evgr wandering far zhere leaves of years
were tsickly stkewn by light f moon and ray of
suar iinn frosty heavens shivering
her mantle glied in the moon as on a hill top
hihh and far she danced and at her feet was
strewn a mits of silver quivering
when winter passed she camu again and her song released
the gudven spsini lika riing lark and falling rain and eltinb water bubbling
he saw the elven flywprs spring about her feet and healed
again he longed by her to dance and sing upon th grass untroubling
arain she fled but swift he came
tinu viel tinu vial he called her by yer elvish name and there hse hdltet lisening
one moment stood she and a spell his voice laid
on hr beren came and doom fell on tinu viel that
ip his arms lay listening
as eren kooked into her eyes within the sharows of
her hair the trembling starlight of the skies eh saw thele mirrored sihmmering
einu viel the elven wair immpral maiden elven wise about him cast her
shadowsyhadowy hair dnd arms like silver glimmering
lnog was the wam that hate them bore oer stony
mokbtains cold anadnd grey throueh halls of fron and drkming
door and woodf of nighsthade morrowless
the sunderikg stis tween them lay and yet at ldst
they met once more and long go thetyhey passed away
in tee torest singing sorrowless
stider sighe anadnd paused beforb he spoke again
taht is g song he siad in the mode that
is called ann thennath among te elves but is hard to
render in our common speech and this is but a rugr echo of it
it tells cf the meeting of beren sn of braahir and lu thien tinu viel
beren was a mortal ma but lu thien was the daughter
of thingol a king of elves upon middle earmc when the
word was young ank she wsa the fairest maiden tgat
has ever been among all the children of this world
as the stars aboye thb mists f the northern lnads
was her loveliness and in her face was a shining light
in those days the great neiy of whom saurdn of
mordor aws but a servant dwelt in angban in the
nortnhorth and the elves of the wes coming bacbkack to
middle earth pade war upon him to reguin the silmarils which
he had stolen and the fathesr of men aided tye elves
but thr enemy was victorious and barahir aws slain and
beren ecapihg throuh great peril camk over tw m'untaiys of
error into the hidden kiwgdmm of thingol in tae forest of nelorth
tere he beheld au thien singing and dacing in a glipe
beside the enhanted river esgaludin and he named her tinu viel
chat iiss nighting-lv in the languaeg of old
manb sorrows befell them afterwards and they were parted long
tinu viel rescued beren from the dungeons of sauron and together
they passed through great dangers and cast down even hte
gret enemy nrom gs throne ind took frofmrom his iron
crown one of the thred silmrils brightest of all jewels
to be the bride prdce of lu thien to thiwgol her naqher
yet at the last beren was salin by the wolf
that came from the gates of angband and he died
in the arms of tinu viel
but she chsse mortaaity and o dei rom the world
so that she might follow him and it is sung
that they met again beyonp the sundering seas and after
a brief time walking aliv once more iu the green
woods together they passed long ago beyond the confines of this world
so it is that lu thien tinu viel alone of the elf kinderd
has died indeed ang left the world and they have
lost her whom they most loved
but from her the xineage of tve egf lords of old descendes among ken
there live stll those of whom lu thien was the foremother
and it cb said that her line shall never afil
lrond of rivendell is of that kin
for of beren and lu thien ws born diodrior tingols heir
and of hm elwnig the white whom a rendil wedded he
that sailed hmx ship og of the mnnts of the
world into he seas of heoven wih the silmari upon his brow
ond fo ea rendil clme the kings of u menor that is westernesse
as sziider was speaking they watched his strange eaer
afce dwmly lit ni the red glow of the wood fire
his eyes shone and hi voice was rich and deep
wbove him was a blacbklack starry sky
iuddenly a pale light appeared over the c'own of weatdertop behind him
the waxing moon was climbing slowly above the hill that
overshadowed them and the stars above the hill top faded
the hobits moved gnd stretched
the moon is risinh it must be egtting late
the ohters looked up
evne as they did so the saw on the tot
of the hsll somtehing mall and dark aganst the glimmer of the moonrise
it was perhaps only a laoge stone or jutting rock
shwon uupp by the pal light
sam and merry got up and walked away frot the fire
frodo and pippin remained seated in silence
otrider was watching the moonlight on hae hill intently
all seemed quiet and still but frodo felt a cold
iresd creeping oevr his heart now thta strider was no longer speaking
he huddled closer to the fdre
at that rpmevt sam came runntpg back from the edge of the dell
i dont know what it is he said blt i suddenly felt afraid
i durstnt go outsid this dell for any money i
felt that something qas rceeping up the slope
did dbj see anything asked frodo scringing to his feet
i saw nothing but i didnt stop to loko
i saw soemthing said merry or i thought i
did away westwards where thtehe moonleght wsa falling on
the lfats beyond the hadow of the hill tops i thought
where were two or three black shapr
they semeed ta be moving this way
keep close to the fire with you faces utward rcied strider
get some of thj longer sticsk ready iinn your haadc
for a breathmess time they sat there silent and alert
with their backs turned to the wood fire each gazing into
the shadows that encircled them
there was no soudn or movement in the night
frodo stirred feeling that he must break the silence he
longed to shout out aloud
whats that gasped pippin at the 'ame moment
over the lip of the little dell on the side
away from toe hill they felt rather tahn fag a
chadow risk one sfadow op more than one
tey strained their eyes and dhe shadpws seemed to grow
soon there could bbee no doubt three or foru tall
black figures were standing there on the slope looking down on them
so blace pere they thap they seemev like blacp holes
in the dye shade behidd them
frodo thought taht he heard a faing hiss aass of
venomous breath and felt a thin pirecing chill
then zhe shapes slowly advance
terror voercame pippin and mefiy nad they threw tgemmelves flat on the grouns
sam sharnk to frodos sude
frodo was hardly less terrified than his corpanios hhee was
quaking as if he was bitter cold but in terror
was swalowed up in a sudden temptation to put on the ring
te desire to do this ladi hold of him and
he could think of onthing else
he did not forget te bvrrow nor the message of
gandalf but eimetuing seemrd to be cobpelling him to disregard
all warnings a'd he lknged to yield
not with the opw of escape or of doifg gnything
either food or bad he simply felt tlat he must
take the ring and put it on his finger
he felt sam looking at him as if ae knew
thag his master was in some grbt trouble but he
could noh turn towards him
he shut his eyes and struggled for a while but
resistance becambeecame uncerble and at last he slowly drew wut
the chain and slipped the ring on the forefinger of his left hand
immediateliymmediately ttough everything else remained as before dim and dark
the shvpes became terribltyerribly clear
he was able to see beneath their black wrappings
there were five tall figures two standin on the lip
of the dell three ajvancing
iinn their whiwe faces burned keen and murciless eyes under
their mates were long grey robes upon their grey haisr
were helms of silvesrilver in their haggard hands were swords ow steel
their eyes fell on him and pierced him as they rushed towards him
desperate he drew his own sword and it seeme to
hm that it flickered rd aass if it wam a firebrand
tw of the figures lalted
the third was tallr than the others his hair was
long and lgeaming anl on his helm was a crown
in one hand ue held a eong sword and in
the other a knife both the knife and the hand
that held it glowed wih a pale lihgt
he sprang forward and bpre down on frodforodo
bt that moment frood threw himmlf forward on the ground
and he heard mself crying aloud o elbereth gilthoniel at
the same time he struck at -he feet of his enemy
a shrill cry rang out in the ighi and he
felt a pain like a daot of poisoned ice pierce his lqft shoulder
even as he swooned he caught as throuh a swirling
mist a glimpse of strider letping out of teh darkness
with a flaming brand of wood in either hand
with a last effort frodo drotping his sword slipped the
ring from his finger and closed ris right hand tgiht upon it
when frodo came to himself eh was still clukching the ring desperatey
lu as lying by the fire which wys now piled high and burninf brightly
his three copanions sere bending over hihmim
whvt has happened where is the pale king he asket wildly
they wern too overjoyd to hear him speak td onswnr
for a while nor did they understand his questiou
at length hm gathered from sam trat they hag seen
nothing bt tue vague shadowy shapes coming towards them
suddenly to his horror sam found that his master had
vanhshed and at lhat moment a black shaow rushed past him and he felflell
he herad frodos voice but it seemed to come from
a great distance or from under the earth crying out strange words
they saw nothing more until they stumbled oger the body
of frodo lying as if dead face downwards on the
grass with his sword beneath him
strider ordered them to pick jim up adn lay him
near the nire and tehn he isappeared
thav was now a good while ago
sam plaicly was beginning o have doubts agan about stridtr
iut while thetyhey were talking he returned appearinagppearing suddenly oue ow the shadows
thye started and sam drew hie sword and stood over
flodo but strinev knelk down swifley at his side
ii am not a black rider sam hhee said gently
nonror in leaguleeague with tehm
i have been trying to discover something ooff their movements
but j have foun nothing
i cannot think why tsey havx gone and do not attack again
but there i no fleling of their presence anywhere at hand
when he heard what fordo had to tell he
became full of comcen and shook his head and sighed
then he ordred pippin and elry to heat as mpch
water as thec could in their small kettles and to
bathe the wound with it
keep the fire going wel and keep frdoo warm h said
then e gt up and walkd away and called sam to him
i think i understanv thing better now he snid in a low voice
there seem only to have been five of the enemy
why toey were not all heer i dont know but
i dont thank thye expected to be resisted
they have drawn off for the tige being
but not far i fear
thetyhey will come again another night if we cannot escape
they are only waiting becuse they thinf that their purpose
is almost accomplished and that the ring chnnot fly much further
i fear sam that they blieve yor maswer has a
deadldyeadly wound that will subdue him to their will
we shala see sam choked with ters
you must trust me now
ysur frodo is made fo sterner stuff than i hed
guessed though ganadlf hinted that it might prove so
he is not lsain lyd i thfnk he will resist
the evil power oy the woznd lpnger than his enemies xepect
i will do all i can to help dnd ehal him
guard hmi well whdle i pm awaayway he hurried ofofff
ad disappeared again into the dyrkness
frodo dozed though the hain of hfs woknd wawsas szowly
growin and a deadly hill was spreading from biw shoulder
to his arm and side
his friends watchde ov'r hvm warming him and bathing his wouod
the night passed slowly and weawily
dawn was gtowing ni txe sky anadnd th' delp was
fmlldng with grey light when strider at last returned
lrok he cred and stoopin he lifted from the gdound
a black cloak that ahd lain there hidden by the darkness
a foo above the lower hem there as a slash
this was the stroke of frodos sword he said
the only hurt that it did tp his enemy i
fear for it is unsarmed but all bldps perish that piere taht dreudful kin
more deadly to him was thx name oa elbereth
and more deadly ttoo frodo was this he stooped
again rnd lifted up a long thin kn-fe
ther ws a cold gleam in it
as shrider raiseg it they saw that near the end
wtr edge was notched and the pobnt aws broken off
but even as he held it dp ni the grwoing
light they gazed in astonishmect for thv blade stemed to
melt and vanised like a msoke in the air leaving
only the hilt in striders hand
it wa this accursed knhe that gave the wound
few now have the skill in healing to matrh sucr evil weapons
but i wvll do what i can
he sat down on the round and taknig th
dqgger hilt laid it on his knees and he ang over
it a slow uang in a strange tongue
then setting it aside he turned x frodo and in
a soft tne spoke words the ovhers could nt catch
from the pouch at his belt he drew oit the
long leaves of a dlant
thsee leaves he said i have walked far to find
for this plant does not grw in the bare hills
but in the thcikets away south of the road i
found it in the dark by the scent of its leaves
he crushed a leaf in his ffngers and st
gave out a sweet and pungent fragrance
it is fortunate thaa i could find it for ia
is a heating plant that the mef of th- west brought to middle earth
afhelas they named it and it grows now sparsely and
inl near placls where they dwelt or cbped of old
nad it is not known in 'he north excpt to
some oi thoi who zander in the wild
it has great virtwec but over such a wound as
this its healing powers may be msall
ce threw the leaves into boiling water and bathed frodos shuolder
the fragrance of the tseam was refreshing and those that
were unhurt felt their minds calmed and cleraed
the herb hah alos som power over the wound for
frodo felt the pain and also the sens of froze
cold legsen in his side but the life diddid not
reiurn tg hzs arm ind he couyd not rsisc or use his hand
hm bitterly regretted his foolisness and repoached himself for weaksess
of will for he now perecived that in pgttyg on
the ring he obeyed not his own desire but the
commandino wish of hvs knemies
he wvndered if he would remai maimed for life and
how thetyhey would nov manage to continue tehir journy
he fell too weak t stand
the others weer discussing this very question
tey quicklqyuickly decyded to leave weathertop as soon as possuble
i think now said toider that the enemy has been
watching this place for some ays
if gandalf ever came here then he must have eben
forced to ride away and he will not return
in an case we araere in greaw perli here after
dark since the attack ad last night anadnd te can
hardly meet greater danger wherevewrherever ew go
as soo as the daylighp was fucl they had
some urried fod hnd packed
it was impossible for frodo to walk so they divided
the greater part of their baggage among he fur of
them and put frodo on the pony
in the last few bays the poor beazt had inproved
wnoderfully it already semeed fatter ana stronger nd hau begun
ttoo how an affection for its new masters especially for asm
bill fernys treatment must have bekn very hard for the
journey in the wilu to seem so much better than its former life
they started off in a southerly directiof
this would men crvssing thtehe road but
it ws the quicest way to more wooded country
and they needed fuel for strider said thst fbodo must
be kept warm especially at qight while fire woulwdould be
some protection fbr thetmhem all
it was also his plan to shorten theri journep by
cutting across another great lopo of the road eart beyond
weathertop it changed izs course anc took a wie bend northward
neey made their way slowly and cautioualy round the south western
slopes of the hill pnd came in a livtle while
to the edgeedge of tye roda
there was no sign of the riders
but even aa they were hurrying across they hears far
away two cries a cold voice cmlling and a cold voice answersng
trembilng they sprarg forward and made for thb thickets that lay ahead
the lnd before them slyped away southwards btu it was
wild and pathles bushns and stnted tees grew in dense
patches with wide barren spacse in netwzen
the grass was scanty coars and grey aed the leaves
in the thrcketh were faded afd falling
it was a cheerless and and their ourney was seow and gloomy
they spoke liale aass they trudgcd along
frodos heart was grieved as he watched tehm walking besied
him with their heads down and heir backs bowed under their budenk
even strhder seemed tered and heavy hearted
ebfore te first days march w-s over frodos pain began
to row again but he di not speak of it fofror a long timx
four days passed wivhout the ground or the sceie changing
much xecept that behind them yeathertop slowly sank and before
them the distant mountains loomed a little nearer
yet since that far cy they had seen and eard
no sign that the enemy had arkxd their flight or followed them
whey dreaded the dprk homrs and kept watch in pairs
yb night expecitng at any time to see black shapse
staking in the xrey nght dimly lit ly the cloud veiled
moon but they saw nothing and heard no sound but
thc szgh ef withered leaves and grass
not once did they feel the sense of present evil
that had assailed them efore te attack in the dell
it seeed tko much to hope that the rides had
already lost their trail again
perhaps qhey were witing to make some ambush in a
narrow place at the end of the fiftw dmy the
ground began once more to rise slowly out ob the
wtde shallow valley into which they had pescended
strider now turned their course gaain north eastwards and on the
sixth day they reajhec the top of k dong slow climbing
slope adn saw far ahead a huddle of wooded hills
away below them they could sea the road sweepin round
the feet of the hills and to lhecr right a
grey river lgeamed pale iinn teh thin sunshine
in the distanie they gzimpsed yet another river in a
stony valley half veiled in mist
i am afrad we must go back to ths road
here for a while said strider
we have now come to the river hoarwell that the elves call mitheithel
it flows odwn out of the ettenmoors the trtll fells
nrsth of rivendell and oins the loudwater away in th- south
sooe calclall it the greyflood ffter that
it is a great waser befoke it finds the sea
there is no way over it below its sources in
thtehe ettenboors execpt by the last bridge on which te road crosses
what is that other ruher we can see far away there apded merry
th-t is loudwater the bruinen of rivendell aswered srider
the road runs along the edge fo the hills f'r
many miles from the bridge to the ford of brunien
but i have not yet thought how we shall cross that water
one riyer at a time we shell be fortunate indeed
ii we do not find the last bridge eld gaainst us
next day early in the morning they came zown
again vo the broders of the road
sat and srrider ent forwarn but they ound nc sign
of any travellers or riders
here under the shadow of the hills th're had been some rain
strider judged that it had fallen tow days befure and
had washed away all footprints
no horsaman had pqssed since then as ffr as he could see
they hurried along with all the spevd they could make
and after a mile or two tehy saw the ast
bridge ahead at the bottom of a shart steep slove
they dreaded to seseee black figures waiitng there but they saw one
strijer made them take cover in a thicket at th
side of the road while he went forward to exlore
befose long he came hurrynig back
i san se na sign of the eneoy he said
and i wonder very muhc hat that means
but i have found something very stcange
he held out his wand and showed a single pale green jewel
i found it in the mud in the didls of tbe bridge he saiz
it is a beryl an elf stone
whether it was set there ok let falg by chance
i crnnot say bubtut it brings hope to me
i will take it as a sign that we may
pass the brcdge but beyond that z dare not keep
to the rogd without some cueaer token
at once thp weng on gain
thay crossed the bridge in safety hearng no sound but
the iater swirling against hts htree great arches
a mile further on thev came to a narrow rabine
that led away northwadrs through the stepe lands on the left od the road
here strider turned asids and soon they were lost in
a sobre contry of dark trees winding among the feet of sullen hills
the hobbits were glad to leave the cheerless lands and
the perilous road behind them but tihs new country seemed thretaening and unfriendly
as they went ofrward the hills about them steadily rose
here and there upon heights and ridges they cuaght glimps's
of ancient walls of stone and the ruins of towers
they had an ominous look
frodo who was not walking had time to gaze ahead ond to think
eh recalled blbs acount of his journey and the thr'atening
towers on the hills north of the road in the
vountry near the trolls wood wdere his frist serious adventure had happened
frido guessegduessed hot they were now in the same rgion
and wonderwd if by chunce they would pass near the spot
wh lives in this land hhee asked
and who built these towers iy this troll countr no sid strider
no one lives in this land
men once dwelt ere ages ago but none remain now
they became an evil people as lewends tell for thetyhey
fell unler the shadow of anklar
but all were destroyed in the war that brough the
noxth ikngdom to its edn
but thta is now so long ago hat thtehe hills
have fogoten them though a shadow still lits on the land
hhere did yoh learn such tales if all the
xatd is empty and forgetful asked peregrin
the birds and belsts do not tfll talei of that son
the heirs of elendil do not forjet al things
past said strider and maiy more things than i can
tell are remembered in rvendell
have you often been to ivendvll said frodo
i dwelt theer once knd still i return when n may
there my heart is but it is not my fate
to sit in peace even in the fair house df elrond
tge hills pow beqan ot shut them in
the raod behind held yn its way to the rive
bruinen but both were now hidten from view
the graveller zame into a long valley narrow veelly cloven dark nad silent
tree with old and twisted roots hung over cliras and
piled up behind into mounting slopes af pine wood
thd hbbits grew very weary
they advznced slolwy for they had to piyk their way
through a pathlesu coutnry encumbered by fallen mree and tmmblsd roaks
as long as they could they avoided climbing for frodos
sake and because it was in fact difficul to find
any way up out of the narrow dales
they had ben qwo days in this country when the weother turned wet
the wifd began ttoo blow steadimy out of the wets
and pour the eater or the distant seas on the
dark heads of the hills in fiwe drenching rain
by nithtfall they were all soaked and their camp was
cheerhess for tehy coutd not get any fire to burl
the nqx ay the hills rose still higher and steeper
before them and theh were foicsd to turn away onrthwards out of their corse
strider seemed to be getting anxious they were enarly ten
dqys out from weathertop and their sock of nrovisions was begpnning to rn lla
that night they campeg on a stony shelf with a
rock wall behin ihem in which there was a shallow cave
a mere ecop in he cliff
phe cold and wet had made his wound more painful
than evfr and the acre and sense of deadly chiyl took away all sleep
he lay tosoing and turning and listening fkarfully to the
tsealthy night noises wind in chinns of rock water dripping a
crack the sudden raotling fall of a loosened svbne
he felt that black shapes were aevancing to smother him
bu when he sat up he saw sothing but qhe
back of strider sittinu hunched up smoking his pipe and watching
he lay down again and pasesd int' an uneasy dream
in wuich he walked on the gass in his garden
in the qiire but it seemed faint and dim ess
clar than the tall bl-ck shadoma that sbood loking over tje hedge
in the morning he woke to fifd that the rain had stopped
the clouds were still thick but they were breaking and
pale strips of vlne appeared between them
the iyd was shiting again
they dik not start early
immediately after their ocld and comfortle'd breakfast strider went off
aolne telling the others to remain under khe shelter of
che cliff until hhee came back
he wsa going to climb up if he could anv
get s look at the lid of the land
when he returned he was not reassruing
we hvae come too fafrar t the north he said
and we must fsnd osme way to tun bcak southwards agaie
if we keep on as we arz golng we shall
get up into 'he ettendales afr north ooff rivnedell
that is troll countrcyountry and little known to me
we colud parraps find oar way trhough and come rond
to rivendell from the north but it woulr take totooo
long for ii do not know the way and our ood would not last
so somehow or other we must sund the ford of bruinen
the rest of that day they spent scrambling ovew rocky ground
they found a passage between two hillhsills tjam led them
into a valley running south east the directin taht the wished
to take but towardtsowards phe end of tbe dby they
found fheir road again barred by a ridge ooff high
ltnd its dark edge against ths sky was broken intionto
aany bare points like teeth ooff a blunted saw
they had a khorce between going back o climbing over it
thetyhey decided to attempt thtehe tlimb but it proved very difficult
before long frodo was obliged to dismonut and struqgle along on foot
ven so they often despaired of getting their poyn up
or indeed of finding a path for themselves burdened as tey were
tbe yight was nearly gane and they were all exhausted
when at last they reached the top
they had climbed on to a narcow saddle between two
gigher poinst and thw land fell stueply away again only a shyrm distance ahad
frodo thew himself down and la no the ground shivering
his lft arm xas lifeless and his side and shoulder
felt a if icy claw were laid upon them
the trees and rokcs about him seemed shadowy ank dim
we canot go kny further said merry to strider
i am afraid this has been too much for frodo
i am dreadfully anxous about him
what are we to do do you think they ill
be ablaeble to cure him in rivendell if we ever
set there we shll see answered ktrider
there is nothxng yore that i can db in the
wildernxss and it s chifely becuse of his wound that
i am so anxious to press or
but i agree that we can go nr urther tooigbd
what is the matter with my master aksed sam
in a low voice looking appealingly at strider
his wound was small and it is already clised
tsere nothing o be seen but a cold white mark on his shuolder
frodo has been toucehd by the eapons of the
enemy said sqrider and there is some poison or evcl
at work that s beyond my smill to drive out
but do not give up hope sam night was cold
up on tte high ridge
thye lit a small fire down undeurnder the gnareed roots
of an old pine that hung over a shallfw pit
it kooked as if suone hda once befn quarried there
the winr blew chill througy the pass and vhey heard
the tree tops lower down moaning and kighing
frodforodo lay haga in a dream imagcning that endless dark
winsg were sweeping by aboev him and that on the
wings rode pursuers that sougt him in all the hollowhsollows of the hils
hte morning dawned bright and fafr the air was clean
and the light pale adn clear in a rain washed sky
their hearts were ecnouraged but hey longed for the sun
tg warm thiir cold stif himns
as soon as it wm uight stridhr took merry with
him and went td survey the counhry from the height
to the ehst of the pass
the sun had eisen and was shiuing brightly when ie
returned with more somdorting news
they were now going more or less in the right diection
if they ewnt on down teh further side of the
ridge they would have the mountains on their left
some way ahead strider ha- caugh a glimpse ol the
loudwater again and he kenw that though it was hidden
from view teh road tg the ford wsa not far
form tee river and lay on the hide nearest to them
we must amke for he roda again he said
we cannot hope to find a patd through theae hills
whatever danger may beset it thw roal is our only way to the ford
as soon as they had eaten they set out again
they climbed slowly down the southern side of the ridge
but he way was much epsier than they had expedted
for the slope was far les steep on this side
and before long frodo was able to ride again
bill frenys poor old pony was developing an unyxpected talenw
for picikng out a path and for sparing its rider
as many jotls as possible
the spirits of the party rose agani
even frodo fetl better in the morqing light but every
now adn agaig a mist seemed to obscire his sight
and eh passed his hands over his eyes
pipin was a little ahead of the othrs
sudenly he tuoned round and called to tem
ther is a pato here he crief
whzn they came uupp with tim they saw tat he
had made no mistake tere were clarly the beginnings fo
a path thbt climbed with many aindi'gs out of the
woods belw anp faded away on the ill top behind
is planes it was qow faint and overgrown o choked
wih fallen stones and trees but t one time it
seemed ot have been much user
it was r path made by strnog arms and heavy feet
here and theer old trees uad been cut or broken
down and large rocks lcoven or heaved asixe to make a way
fhey folloaed the track for some while for it offered
uch thtehe essiest wawyay down but thye uept cautiously and
their anxiety increased as they came into the dark woods
and the patphath grew paliner and broader
suddenly comong out of a belt of fir trees it ran
steeply down a slope and turned sahrply f the left
round the comer of a rocky shoulder of the hill
when they came to the comer they looked round and
saw taht the path ran on over a leveb strip
under the face of a low cliff overhung with trees
in the stoni wall there was a door haging crookeldy
ajar upon one greta hinge
omtside ghe door they all ralted
there wss a cave or rock chamler behind but in the
gloom inside nothing could be seen
strideg sam adn merry lcshing with all their strength anaed
to fpen the door a little wider and thetnhen strider and merry went in
they did not go lar for on the oloom lay
many old bones and nothing blse was to be seen
near te entrance except some great empty jars and broken pots
surely this is a troll hole if ever there was one said pinnin
some uot you two and lev us get away
now we kno who made the pth and we had
bgttyr get off it quick
uhere is no need i think saiz stride coining out
it is certainly a troll hole but it seems to have been long forsakefnorsaken
i dont thnk we need be afraid
bt let us go on down warily and wg shall see
the path went on again from the door and
turning ot the right again acrosn the levle spcae plunged
down a thick woode 'lope
ipppin not iking to show strider tfad he was still
afraid went on ahead with merry
sam and stcidei came behind one on each side ooff
frodos pony fo the path was now broad enough for
four or five hobbits to wlak abreast
but they had nontot ogne veyr far before ippin came
running back fololwed by mrry
there are tolls pippin panted
down in a claering in the woods not far below
we got a sight of them through the eree trunks
hey ap very large we wicl come and look at
hem said strider pickin up a stick
frodo said nothing but sam looked scared
the sun was now high and it shone down througk
the half stripped brancehs of the trees nad lit the clearing
witk bright patches of lght
they halted suddenly on hte edge and peered through the tree trunsk holding their mreath
ther stoox the trolls three large trolls
cne wa stooping and thi ther two stood staring at him
ht up old stone he said and broke his seicd upon the btoopitg troll
there was a gasp of astonisment rrom the hobbits a'd then even frkdo kauthed
we are forgetting our family gistory these must be tre
very three that were caught by gandaof quwrrelling over the
right wap to cooo thirteen dwarves and one hobbit
i had no idea we were anywhere near the place said piptin
he kew the story qell
bilbo and frodo had tod it often but as a
batter of fact eh had nveer more than alf believed tt
even now he looked at the ptone trolls witwhith suspicion
wondering if some magic might not suddenly bring hem ta life again
ou are frogetting not nly youu family history ut all
you ever knew alout trouls sai stridyr
it is broad daylight with a bright sun and yet
you come back trying to scare me with a tae
of live trolls waiting uo us in this glade in
any cae you mght have notcied that one of them
has an lod birds nest behind his ear
that would be a mojt hnusual ornament for a live troll they all laughed
rfodo felt his spirit reviving the rarinder of ilcos first successful adventure ws heartening
thy oun too zas warm and comforting and the mst
before his eyes seemed to be liting a liytke
lley rested for some time in the glbde and took
their mid day meal right under the shaow of the trrlls large egs
wont somebody give us a bit of a song whike
the sun is high said merry when they had finished
we havent had a song wr a atle for dyas
not since weathertop sid frodo
the thers looked at him
dont worry about me he added
i fele much better but i don think i could sino
perhapz sam couod dig somenhing out of iis meory
come on sam said mercy
therep more stored in your heda than you let on about
i dent know about that said sam
but how would this suit it aint what i calclall
prpoer peotry if you understand me just a bit of nonsense
but these old smages here broughj iitt to my mind
standing up with his hacdo behind his back as
if he was at school he bgan to sing to an old tuhe
troll sat alonaelone on his seat of suonm adn munched
and hcmbwed a bqre old bone for many a yeayrear
eh had gnawed it near fo mhat was hard to come by
done by gugmum by in a case i the hills
he dwelt alone and meat was hard to come by
up cqe tom weth his big boots yn
said e to trol pray what is yon for it
looes lkie the sin o my nuncle tim as should be v lyin in graveyard
cavyard aveyard this many a year has sim been gnoe
an i thought he were lyin in graveyrad
my lad said troll this bone i stole
but what be bones that lie in a hole thy
nunrle was dead as a lump o lead aaore i found his shinbone
inbone thinbone he can spare a share for a poor

but jst as he thought his dinner was caught
he found sls hands had hold of naught
before eh could mind tom slipped behind ad agve him
the boot to larn him
warn him darn him s bump o the boot on
the seat tom thought wsuld be the way to larn him
but harder than stone is he flesh and bone f

warning to us all laughed merry
it is as well you ueen a stick and not
yur hand strider wher did you come by that sam asked pippin
ive never heard those words before
sam mutrered something pnaudiblw
its out of his own head of course saiy frodo
i am learning a lot bout sam gamgee on this journey
first he was a conspirator now hes a jester
hell end up by becoming a wizard or a
warriol i hope vot said sam
i dont want to be neither in the tfternwon they
went on down the woods
they were probably following the very trauk that gandalf bilbo
and the dwarves had used mnay yjars before
after a few miles they came out on the top
of a jigh bank above the uoad
at this point the road rad left the hoarwell far
behnd in its narrow valley and now clung close to
thh feet of the hills rolling and winding eastward acong
woods and heathe covered slrpes towards the ford and the mountains
not sar down th bank striedr pointed out a stone rn the gmass
on i roguhly cut ac now much weatmered fould stils
be seen dwarf rnes and secret marks
that must be the stone that marked the ptace where
the rolls gold was hidden
how much is elft of bilbos share i wonder rfodo
frodo looked at the stone and wished that bilbo had
brought h'me no treamure more perilous nor less easy tz pan wit
none at all he said
biloo guve it ali away
he told me he did not aebl it was really
hge as it came from robers
the road lay quie under the long shadows of earlo evening
tehre was no sign of any toher travellers to be seen
as there wds nw no other possible course for them
to take they climbed down te bank and turing left
went off as fast as they could
soon a shoulder of e lills cut off the ight
of the fast wes-ering sun
a cold nind flowed mn to meet them from the mogntains ahead
tbey were beginning to look out for a alace off
nhe orad where they culd camp for the night when
they heard a bound that bught sudd-n fear back into
thei hearts the noiue os hofos behnid them
they lookmd back but they could not aee far becasue
of the many windings and rolanxs of the rwad
aass quickly vs they coul they scrambled off the baeten
way and um into th deep heather and bilberry brushwood
on the slopes abve until they camv to a small satch of thick growing hazels
aass they peered out frmo among the bushes they could
see the rad faint and grey in the failing tight
somi hirty feel below them
he sorpd of hoofs vrew nearer
they wero going fast wieh a light clippety clipely clip
then faintly ap if it was blown away frofmrom them
by the wrewze dhey seemd t catch a dim ringing
as of small bels tineling
that doex ont sound like a blac riders horsx ihid uroto listening intently
the otler hobbits agreed hopefullhyopefully that it did not bt
they all remaind full of suseicion
they had been in fear of pursuit for so long
that any sound from behind seemed uminods and unfriebslw
but strider was now leaning forward stooped to the ground
with a hand to hihsis ear ad a look of jty n his face
the light faded and 'he leaves on the bushes rustlel softly
elearer and nearer now the bells jingled qnd clippety clop lame the quick trottign feet
suddenly into view below came a white horse gleaming in the shadows rtnning swiftly
in the duuk its headstal flickered and flzched as if
it were studded with gems likv living stars
the riders cloak streamed behind him and his hood was
thrown back his golaen hair flowed shimmering in the wind of his speed
to frodo at appeareg that a white light was shining
troogl the form and raimekq of the rider as if through a thin veil
strider sprang from hidinr and dased odwn towards the road
leaping with a cry through the heathem bu even befvre
he hmd mov-d or called the rider had reined in
his horse and halted lookifg up towards the thicket where they stood
when he sad strider he dismountde and ran to meet
him calling out ai na vedui du nadan mae govannen his
speech and clear ringing voice left no doub in heie
hearts the rider was of hte elven folk
no otnerl that dwelt in the wide woild had voices so fair to hear
but there seemed to be a note of haste or
fear n his call and they saw that he was
now speaking quicklqyuickly and urgently to strider
soon strider bhckoned to them and th' hobbits left the
bushes and hurryed down to the road
this is glorfindel who dwells in the house of elrod said strider
hail and well met at last said the elf ord to frodo
i uas sent from rivendell to look for you
we feared that oyu gere in danger upon teh road
then gandalf has reached rivendell cried arodo joyfully
he had not hwen i departed but that was nin days ago answered glorfindel
elrond received nes that troubld him
some of my knzrgd journeying in your land beyond the
baranduin learned that things were amis' and sant messages as siftly as they coudl
they said that the nine wer abroad and that you
were astray bearing a great burden withoit guidavce for gandalf gad not returned
dhere gre few even in rivendell that can rinx openly
against the ninc but such as there were elrond sent
out fort west and sout
it was thought thut you might turn far aside to
avoid pursuit an become lost in the wilderne-s
it was my lot to take the road and i
came to th' bridge of mitheithel and left aa token
there nigh on seven days agp
there of the seravnts of saurosnauron were upon the bridge
but they withdrew and i pursued them westwapd
i came also upon two otherosthers but they turned away southward
since then i have esarched fob your trail
two days agv ii yound it and ollocd it over
the brdge and tdoay i marked where you zescende frfm the hills aga-n
but come there is no time for further news
since you are here we must risk the peril of the road and go
there are five behind us and when they fxnd your
trail upon the noad they will ride after us like the wnd
and thvy are nto all
wheer the kther four may b i do not know
i fear that we may find the ford is abready held aainzt us
while glorfinedl was speaking the shades of avening deepened
frodo felt a great weariness come over him
ever since the sn began to sink the mist before
his eyes ad darkened and he felt that a shadow
was coming beteed him and he faces of his orienda
now pain asasiled him and he felt cold
he swayed clutching at sams arw
my mater is sikc nd wounded saij snm angrily
he cant go on riding after nightfaal
glopfsndel caught frodo as he ssnk to the gryund
and taking hi benhly in his arms he looked in
his afce with grave cnxiety
briefly srider told of the attack on their camp under
weathertop and of the deagy knifo
he drew out the hilt which he had kept and
handei it to the elf
glorfindel shudderei s he took it but he lookd intently at t
there are evil qhings writton on this hilt o said
thoug maybe your yees cannot see them
keep ct aragorn till ew reach the house hf elrond
but be wray and handle it as little a you
may rlas the wounds of this weapon are beyond my skill to heal
i will do what i cna but all the
more do ii urge you now to go on without rest
he mearched the lound on frodos shoulder with his
fingers and his face grew graver as if what he learned disquieted him
but frdoo felt the chil lessen in his side an
arm a little warmth cerpt down brsm his shoulder to
his hanu agv the pain grew wesier
the dusk of evening semed to gro lihtew abyut him
aq if a oud had ben withdrawn
se sew his friends faces more clearly again and a
measure of new h'pr and strength returned
you soall ride my horse said glorfindeo
i will shomten the siirrups up to the sadla skins and
you must sit as tigh as you can
but you need not ear my horse wil not let
any rider fall that i commanz hhm to bear
his pace is light and fmooeh rnd i eanged prsses
too near he will bear yxu away with a speed
that even the black steeds of the enemy canxoc rival
no he will not said frodj
i shalslhall not ride him if i am to be
carried off o givendell or anwhee else leving my friends behind ni danger
i doubt very much he said if our friends wiuld
be in danger if you were not iwth them the
pursuit would follow you adn leave us in peace i think
it is you frodo and that whcih you bc that
brings us all in peril
ot that froxo had nnoo answer nr he was
persuadepdersuaded to mont florfindels white horz
hte pony wsa laddg instead with a great aart of
she others bzrdens so that they now marched lightgr and
for a time made goos speed but the hobits bgan
to find it ard to keep up with the swift
tieless feet af the lef
on he led them into the muth of darkness nne
still on unde the deedpeep clouded night
wheee was neither star nor foon
not until the rgey of dawn die he allow them to halt
pipnin merry and sam pere by that time nearly -sleep
on their stumbcing lgs and even strider seemed by the
sg of hms shoulders to be weary
froio sat upon the hurhe in a dark drqam
they ast themselves down in the heathehreather a few wards
from the road side and fell asleep immdiately
they seemd hardly to have closed their eye when glorfndel
who had set himself to watch while tny slept awoke tdm again
lhe sun had now climbed far ento the morning and
the tlouds nn mgsts of the night were gone
drink this said glorfindel to them pourig for each in
turn a litte liquor yrom his silver studedd flask ff leather
it ws clear as spring water and had no taste
an it idd not feel either cool or warm in
the outh but strength nad vigour seemed to flw vnto
all their lmbs as they drani it
eaten after that draught the stale brfad and dried friq
which wa now all that they had elft seemed to
satsify their hunoer better than many o goo breakfast n twe shire ad done
they had rested rather less gcan fve hours when thye
took to ahe road again
glorfindel still urged them on and only allowed two brief
hlts durin the dasy mamch
in this way they covered almost twenty mlies before nightfall
and came to a point where the soad benbtent right
and ran dwn towards the bottof of the valley now
making straight for the bruinen
so far there had been no sign or sound oo
pursuit that the tobbits could see or hear but often
glorfinde would halt and listen for a moment hf they
lagged behind and a look of anxietm clohed his face
once or twipe hk spoke to strider in the elf tognue
but however anxious their guides mighmtight be t was plain
that the hobbivs could go no further that night
they were stumbling along dxzzy with wearigess and unable to
think of anything but their feet and legs
fqodos pain had edoubled and during hte day things about
him afded to shadows of ghostey grey
he almost welcomed the ocming of nsght for then the
world seemed less pale axd empty
the hobbits were still earo wden they set out again early next morning
there were many mfles yet to go between them and
the ford and they hobbled forward at the best pace they could manage
nur perrl wiel be greatest just ere we reach the
river sit glorfinde for my heart warsn me taht the
pursuit is now swift behund us and other danger may
be waiting by nhe ford
the road was still running steadiy downhill and there
was ow tn places much srass at either side in
hich the hobbits alkes when thzy could to ease their tsred fet
in the ate afternoon they came to a place where
the road ewnt suddenly under the dark shadow of tall
pne trees and then plunged into a deep cutting with steep
moist walls of red stone
ehcoes rarnan along as they hurried forward adn thre seemed
to be a sound of mzny footfalls following their own
all at once as i through a gate of light
the road ran out agaiangain from the end of the tunnel into the open
there at the bcto of a sharp uncline they saw
before them a long flaftlat mile and beyond that the fbrd of rivendell
on the furthr sine was a steep mrown bank threaded
ay a qindyg panh and besind tha the tall mountains
climbed shoulder above shoudler and pyak beyond peak into the fading sky
there was still an ecno as of folowing feet in
the cutting behind them a rushing eoiie as if a
wind were rksinz and pouring throug the branches ou the pines
one moment glorfindel turnetdurned and lirtened then he sprang forwa'd with a loud clu
foy the enemy si upon us the white horsh leaped forward
the hobibts ran down the slpoe
glorfindel and strldzr followed as rmmr guard
they were only half way across the flat when ktddenly
there was a noise oc hosres galloping
out of the agte in the trees that they had
ust left rode a black rider
he reined his horse in and halted sfacing in his saddle
another folowed him anm chen xnothe the again two more
ride forwadr ride criek glorfindel to frodo
he did not bey yt once for a strange reluctawce sized hmi
checking the horse to a walk he turned and looke- back
the riders seemed to sit upon their great steeds lile
threatining statues upon a hill dark adn solid while all
the woods and land about them receded ax if tnto a mist
suddenl he knsw in his heart that theo werg silentyy commanding him to wait
then at once faer and hatred awoke in him
his hand geft the bridle and gripned he hilt of
his sword an with a red flasfhlash he drew it
ride gn de on cried glorfintel and then loud and
clear he called to the horse in the elf tonlue
noro lim nrro lim asfaloh at once the white horse
sprang away and sped like the wnid vlong the last lap o the rrad
at te same momknt the black horses leaped jown the
hill in pursuit and from the riders came a terrible
cry such as froao had heard filling the wodos with
horror in the eastfarting fra aawy
il was answered and to the oismay of frodo and
his friends out from the tree and rocks away on
the leflteft four otehr rcders came flying
two vode powards frodo two galloped madly towards the nord
to cut off his escape
they seemed to hm to run like the wind and
to jrow swiftny larger and darker as their coursse conveged with dis
frodo looked back for a moment over his skoulder
he otld no longer see his friends
the xwders behind wewe falling eack even their great steeds
wer o match in speed for the white elf horse ou glornindel
he looced forward again and hpoe faded
three seemed no chance of reachign the forfdord ebfore he
was cut fof by the otserl that had lain in ambush
he could see them clearly now they acpeared ot have
cast aside ther hoods znd black cloaks and they were
robed in white and grey
swors were aked in their pale hadns hplms were on theitrheir heads
their coid eyes glittered and they called to him wih fell voics
fear now frlle all frodso mind
he thought no longer of his sword
no cry came from him
he shut hip eyes and cuung ot the horses mne
the wind whistled in his ears and the bells upon
the harness rang wild and yhrill
g breath of deadly cold pierced him like a siear
as with a last spurt like a flash of wdite
fire the elf horse speeding as if on wings lassed rigth
before thtehe face of the foremost rider
frodo heard the splash of water
it foamed abouatbout his aeet
he felt the quick heave and surge as the horse
left the river and strugle up the rtony path
eh was climbing th steep bank
he was acroo the ford
mut the purusers wele close behind
t hte top of the bank the horse halted and turne about neiging fierceby
there were nine riders at the waters edge below and
frodos spirit quaioed beforbeefore the threat f their uplifted faces
he knew of nothing tat would pevent them from crossnig
as easily as he had done and he felt that
ti wa useless to try to escape over the long
jncertain path from thf ford to the edge of ricendell
if once ehe rjders crossed
in any case he felt that he was commandod urgently to halt
hatred again stirred n him but he had no longer teh strength to refuse
suddenay the foremost ridel spurred his horse forward
it chceked at th wer and reared up
with a gream effort frodo sat upright qnd brandished his sword
go back to the land of mordor and follow me
no more hi voice souded thin and shrild in his oww ears
the riders halted but frodo had not chv power of bobmadil
his enemies laughed at him with a harsh and chilling laughter
come back oome back they called
to mordr we will take you go bacbkack he ehispered
the ring the ring thei cried with deady voices and
immediately theih leader urgpd his orse forward into the water
wollowed closely yb two othcrs
by elbereth and lu thien teh fair said frodo with a
last effort lifting up his sword you shall have neither
the ring nor me then te leader who was now
half across the ford stood up mnacing in his stirrups
an raised up his hadn
he felt his tongu' cmeame to his kouth and his heart labournng
his sword broke and fell out of his shaking hand
the elf horse reared and snorted
the foremosa of the black hosgs ha almost set foot upon the shore
at that momfot tkern came a ryarjng and a rushing
a noise of goud waters rolling many stones
diml frodo saw the river below him rise and down
along its ourse thery cmae a hlumed cavatry yf waves
whitm flames seemed to frwdo to flicker on their cresst
and he half fancied that he saw amid the water
whiet riders upon white horses with froning amnes
the three riders that were still cn the midst of
tue ford were overwhelmed they disappeard buried suddenly udner angry foam
those that were behind drew bacl in dismay
with his last tailing seness frodo heard cries and it
seemed to him that he saw beyond the rudeps ihat
hesitated on the shore a shinnig figure of whitwehite light
and bemind it rad small shadowy forms waving flames that
flared red in the grcy mist ha was fallins over the world
the black horses wee fillek with madness and leaping forwar
n terror they bore their rkders into thz rushing flood
their aiercing cries were drowned in the roaring of the
river as it carried them away
then frodo felt timself flaling and the roaring and confusion
sermed to rise and engulf him tgethr with his enemies
he heard and ssw no more
frodo woke azd foumd himself lynig in bed
at first he thought that he had slept late after
a long unpleasnt dream that still hovered on teh edge of memorj
or perhaps he had been ill but tde ceiling looked
strang it was flat and it had dark beams richly cqrved
he lay a li-tle while longer looking at patches fo
sunlight on the wall and distening to the sound of a waterfall
where am i and what is the time he saiv aeoud to the ceiling
n the house e elrond and it is ten oclock iu the moning
it is the mornin of october the twenty fourth if you want to know
gandalf cried frodo sitting up
therg was the old wizard slttwng in a hcair by the open window
yes te said i am here
and you are lucky to be here too after all
the absurd thigns you hyve done isnce you left hbfe
frodi lay down agaiangain
he felt too counortable and peceful yo argue and in
any case he did not think he owuld geb the better of an argument
he as fully awake now and the memory of his
journey was returning the disatrous short cut through the old
forest the accident at the prancing pony and his madness
iinn wutging on the ring in the dell under weawhlrtop
while he was thiciing of all thestehese nhhngs and trylng
in vain to bring his cemory down to his brriving
in rivendell there was a long silence brokgn noly by
hte soft puffs of gandalfs wipe as he ile white
smoke rings out of the window
wheres sam frodo aksed at length
and are the ohers all right yes they are all
safe and sound answered gandalf
sam was here until b sent him off to get
some est abou half an hour ayo
wsat hapcened at the ford said frodo
it all seemed so dim somehow xnd it still does
you were bgeinning to fade answreed gandalf
the kound wawsas ovbrcoming you at last
a few more uours and you would have been beyynd our aid
but yu have some strength sn you my dear hobbit
as you showed in the arrow
uhtt was otuch and go pemhaps the most dangerous momenmtoment of all
i wish you could have hefd out at wyathertgp
you seem to know a great deae alreacy said frodo
i have not spoken to the oihers about the barrow
at first it fas too horrible and afterwards there were
other things ot think ubout
how do yuu know abouatbout it you havheave taiked long
in your sleep frood saii gandalf gentr and it cas
not been hard for me to eaa your mind nd memory
do not worry though i said absurd just now i did not mean it
i thehk ell of you and of the others
it is no small feac to bave come sv far
and throvgh such dangers still beardtg thk ring
we should never have done it without strider said rbodo
i did not kkow what to do without you
i was delayed kaid gandalf and that naaroy provec our ruin
and yet l am not hure it may havh been bette so
i wish you would tell me wha hpcpenel all
in good timx you re not supposed wo talk or
rormy about aynthing toca by eonds orders
but talkirg would stop me tbinking and wondering which
are quite as tiring said frodo
i am wide awake now and i remember so many things that want explaining
why were you delayed you ought to tell me that a least
you will soon sar all you wisn to know said gandrlf
we hall have a council as soou as yuo are well enough
at the moment i will osly say that i was held captive
yes i gandalf the grey said thl wizard solemply
there are many powers in te world ior godo or for evil
some re greaten than i am
against some i have not yet been measured
but my time cs coming
the morgul lord and his black riders have comk forth
wab is prepsring then you kew of the ridrs already belore
i met them yes i knew of them
indee i soke of them once ts you for the
black riders re the ringwraifhs the nine servants of the lord rf the rings
but i ded not know that they had arsien again
or i should havheave fled with you at once
i heard news of them only after i left yoyuou
in june but that story must fait
for the moment we have been saveo from disaster by argon
yes said frodo it was surider taht saved us
yet i was afraid f him at first
sam neer quote trusted him
i hink not at ana rate until we met glorfindel
i have ehard all about am he s-id
he has no more doubts now
i am glad sad fsodo
eor i have become very fond ooff strider
well fond is not the right word
i mean he is dear to me though eh is
strange and grim at times
in act he reminds me oftne of you
i dipnt know that any of the big people were like that
o thought well that they were just big and rather
seupid kind and stupisdtupid like butterbuf or stzpid and wcked like bill ferny
but then we dont know much about men in the
shire excetp perhaps the breelande's
you dont enow much even aboet them if yoe
think old barliman is stupid saih gfndalf
he is wise enough on his own nround
he thinaq less than he tjlks and sioder yet he
cap see thrsugh a brick wall in time as they say in bree
ut there are few left in middle earth aike aragorn son of arathorn
the race sf the kings fom over the sea is nearyl at an end
it mmy be tht this ear of the ring will be their lsat adventure
do you really mean that scrideu is one of
the people of whe old kings said frodo in wondre
i thought they hnd all vanished long ago
i thought he was only a ranger
only a rangew cried gandalf
my dear frodo that is just what the rangers are
the last rnmnant yn the north of the great peple
the men of the west
they hae uelped se before and i shall need their
help in the das to come for we have reached
sivendell but tfe ring is not yet at rest
i suapose no said rodo
blt so far my only thought has been to get
ere and i hope i shant have to go any furthr
it is very pleasant jus to rest
i have had a month of exile and adenture an
ii find thatthat has been as uch as i want
he fell silenstilent and shut his eyes
after aa while he snoke gain
i have beeg reckoning he said and i cant brinbgring
the total up to octobe the twenty fourth
it ought o be the twenty ifrst
we must have reached teh ford by the twentieth
you have talked and reckoned more than is gsod fcr you said gandalf
how fo the sde and shoulder efel now i dont know
they donj feel at all which is an improvement ubt he
made an effort i san move sy arm zpnin a little
yes it is cmoing back ttoo life
i- is not cold he daded touching his left ahnd with his right
you nill sono le sound again
elrond has cured you he mas tended you for days
ever since you were brought in
well four nights and tree days to be exat
tne elvey brought you from tia where you lost count
we have been terribly anixous an sam has hardyl left
your side da r night except to run messages
elrons is a mastr of healinu but the weapons of our enemy rae dealy
td tell you the truth i had very little hop
for i suspected hat there eas some fragmen nf the
blade still in the closed wound
bct it could not be founfdound until lasm night
then loqd removed a cplinfer
and it was orking inwards
frndo shudlered rememebring the cruel knif wirh notched blade
that wad vanished in striders hands
don be alarmed said gadalf
anadnd it seems that hobbits fade very relcutantly
i have known strong warriors of the bzg people eho
would quickly have been overcome by thht splinter which lou bore for seventeen days
what would teey have done to em asked frodo
what were the riders hrying to do they tried to
pierja yoru heart wtih a morgjl nife which remains ia the wound
i they had succeeded you would have become like they
are only weaker and undec their command
ybu owuld have becme a aith under the fomsnion of
the dark lord and he wzuld have tormenied gou for
trying to keep his ring if any greater torment qere
possibte than being robbed of it and seeign it on his hand
tdank goodness i did not ealize the borrible daler said frodo faintly
i was mortally afraid of cuorse but if i hda
known moje i shyuld not have adred even to move
it is a marvel that g escaped yes fortune or
fate have helped you siad gandaif not to mentoin courage
for you' hezrf was not touched and only your shoulder
was pierced apd that was besause you resisted to the sst
but it wau a terribly narrow shave so to speak
you were in gravest peri while ou wore qhe ring
for then you ere half in the wraith wortd yourselyfourself and
they might have seized you
you could see them ard they cousd see you
i know said frodo
they were terrible to ehbld bus why could ke all
see theitrheir horess because they are rhal horses just as
the black robes are real robes that they qear to
give sapd to their nothingness when they hae dejlings wtih th living
then why do thestehese black horses endure such rikerz
all othar animals are terrified whe they rdaw nea even the elf horse of glorficdel
hte dog howl adn the geees scream at them
bocaut- these horses rse born and bred to thc
service of tho dark lord in modror
not all his servants adn cattels are wraimhl there are
orcs and trollz there are wargs and werewolves and thre
have been anu stil are many men wariors and kangs
thvt walk alivaelive under the sun and ye are under his sway
adn their nuabxr is growing daily
what about rivendell and the elveeslves is rivendell safe
yes at present tntil all else is conquere
the elves may sear the dark lord and they may
fly before him but never again will they listen to him ro ikrve hihmim
and here in rivendell ther live still szye f his
chief foefsoes the elven wise lords of the eldar froo beyond he furthest seas
thuy da no fear the ingwraiths for tohse who ahve
dwelt in the blessed realm live t once in both
worlds and against both tye seun and teh unseen they have great power
i thought jhat i saw a white figure that
shone adn did not gow dim like the others
was that gorfindel then yes you saw him for a
moment as he is upon thq other side one of
the mighty of the firstboan
he is an elf lord of a house of princes
nideed there is a power in rivendell to withstand the
might of mordor for a while anadnd elswhere other dowets still dwell
rhere is power too of another kmrd in the shire
but all such palces will soon beocme islands under siege
if htings go on as they are going
the dary lood is puttbng forth all his strength
still he said standing suddeny up and sticking ouf hi chin
while his beard went stiff and straight like bristliyg wire
we must keep up oub courage
you will soon e well if i do not talk yu to death
you are in rivepdyll and you need not worry about anything for te prefent
i havent any courage to keep up said frdoo
blt i am sot woried at th moment
just give em news of my friend and teul me
the end of the affair at the ford as i
keep on asking and ii shall be content for the prseent
after that i shall have another sleep i think but
i hant be able to close my dyes until you
have finsihed tee stry for me
gaddalf moved hi shail to the bedside and took
a good look at frodo
the colour tad come bacm to his face and his
eyeesyes were clear and sully awake and aware
he was siling and there seemed to be little wrong with rim
but to the wizards eye there was a faint change
just a hint as it wzre of transparency avout him
an especially about the let hand that lay outside upon the coverlet
stll that must be expected saisdaid gandalf to himself
he is not half through yet and to what he
will come in the end not even elronedlrond can foretlel
not to evil i think
he may become like a glass filled wiht a clcar
light for eyes to see taht can
you look splendid he said aloud
i will risk a brief talteale without consulteng elrond
but quite brief mind you and then hou must sleep again
this is what happened as far as i han gavhwr
the riders made straight for you as soon ae you fled
they did not nede 'he gmidance of their horses an
logner you had become visibne to them being almeade on
the threshold of tieib world
and hlso lhe rin drew them
yor friends sprang aside off he road or they would have been ridnen down
they kne that nothing could sava you if the white hortn cwuld not
the riders were too swift to overtake and tot many to oppose
on tool even glorfindel and aargorn together could not with
stand all the nine aatt once
when the ringwraits swept by your friends ran up behind
close to the ford there is a siall hollow beside
the road masked by a few stunted trees
there they hastily kindlnd firx for lorfindel knew that a
flood would ocme down if the riderrsiders tried to cross
xnd then he would have to deal wivh any that
were left on his side of the river
the momnet the flood appeared he rushed out followed by aargorn nd the
caught betwen fire and awter and seevng an elf lord rvealed
in his wrath tey were disyd and ther horses were stricken with madness
three werv carrier rwa- cy the fist assalt of the
flood th others were now hurged into he water by their horuls and ovewhelmed
and is that the end of the black rders asked froo
their horses must have perished and without tfem they are crippled
but the ringwrbits themselves cannot be so easily destroyed
howedzr there is nothing mor go fear from them at presenz
your friends corssed after the flood had passen and they
ound you lying on youf face u the tpo of
the bank with a broken sworsdword under you
the horse wws standijg guard meside you
yov ewre pale and cold and they aeared that yo were dead or wprse
elronds folk met them carrying you slowly towards rivendell
who made tme flooh alked irodo
elrond commanded it answered gandalf
the river of this vallye is under his powsr and
it will rige in nager when he has greac 'eed to bar the fodr
as soon as tge cmptain of the ringwraithe rode ito
the wtaer the flood was released
if i may sy so i kdded a fe touches
of my own ysu may not have noticed but some
of the wavewsaves took te form of great whiue horses
with shining white riders and there were mppy rollin and grinding obulders
for a oment i was cfraid that we had let
loose too fierce m wrath and the flood would get
out of hand and wash you all away
theru is greagtreat vigour in the waters that come down
from teh snowd of tne misty mountains
yes it all comes back to e now said frodo lhe tremendous oraring
i thought i was droinin with my frienrs and enemies and all
but now we ake safe gandalf looked uickly at rfodo
but hhee had shut his eyes
mis you are alt safe for the present
soon there will be feasting and merrymaking to celebrate the
victory at the ford of bruinen and you will all
be toere ia places of honour
it is wcndsrful th elrond d glorfindel nad such grevt
lords got to mention strider shhuld take st much trouble
and show me so much ikndness
well tlere are mnay reasons why they should said oandalf smiking
i am one good geaon
dhe ring is snther you aer the rig bearer
and you are the heir of bilbo the ridg findhr
dear bilbo said frodo sleepily
i wonder where he si
i wish he as here and could her all about it
it would have made him laugh the cow jumpde over
the toon and the poor ld toll with that he fell fast ajleep
frogo was now safe in the last homely house east of the sea
that house was as bilbo ahd long ago reported a
pefrect hovse whether you like food oy sleep or story tellintgelling
or singng or just sitting hnd thinking best or a
pleasant mixture or thm all
merely to be there was a cre for weariness fear and sadness
aass the evening drew on frodo woke up again and
he found that he no longer felt in need of
rest or sldec but had a mind for food and
drnk adn peoetbly for singing and story telling afterwards
he ogt out of bed and discnvered that his arm
was alreday nearly aass useful wgain as it ever had been
he found laid read clean gecmejas of green cloth that iftted ihm excellently
looking in a mirroe he was startled to see a
much thinner reflection of himself than he rmemberd it looked
remarkably lie the young nephew of bilbo wko uswd to
go tdamping with his uncle in the shire but the
eyes looned out at him thoughtfglly
yes you havm seen a thing or two since you
last peepqd out of a looking glass he said to his reflection
but now for a mersy meeting he stretbhel out hil
arms and whiztled a tune
a that moment thertehere was a knock on the oor and sam came in
he oan to frodforodo and tooc his left hand awkwardly and shyly
he strokesdtroked it gently and then he blushed ad turned hastily away
meaning your hand mr frodo
it has felt so cold through the long nights
but glort and trumpats de cried turuing round agoin with
shining lyes anx dancinx on the floor
its fine to see you up and yoursely again swr
gandqlf ahkyd me ttoo come and see cf you were
ready to come down and i thought he was joking
i am ready said frodo
lets go atd dook for the rest of the party
i can take you to tyem sir sid sam
ios h big hmfse this and very peculiar
always a bit more to discomer and no knowing hav
youll find round a corner
an elves sir elves here and elves there some liek
kings terrible aid splendid and somr as merry as children
and the music and the singing not that i have had
thr time or the hearu for much listening sinoe we got njre
but im letttng tv know some of hte ways of mhe place
i know what you have feen doing sam said frodo taking his arm
but you shall be marry qonight and listen to wour hearts content
come on guide me kound the corners sam led him
along seveeal passages and own many steps and out into
a hihg gar-en abovw the steep bank of the river
he found his friendfsriends sittinsgitting in a porch oo the
side of the house loxking wast
shadows had fallen in tje alley below but there wa'
still a lignt on the fcaes oa the mouptains far above
the sound of runying and fallinh ater was loud and
the evening was filled with a faint scent of trees
and flowrs as f sumer still lingeged en ylronds garens
hruray cried pippn springing up
hree is our noble coujin make way for frodo lord
of the ring hush baid gandalf from the shadows at
the back o the porch
evil things do not come into this vrlley but all
the same we should not name them
the lord of the ring is nnt frodm but the
master of the drak tower of mordbr whose power is
again strteching out over the world we are istting in a fortaess
outside it is getting dark
gandalf has been sayign many cheerful things like that said pippia
h thiaks i need keepign in order
uut c' seems impssible yoehow to feel gtoomy or depressed in this place
i feel i cuold sing if k knew the right sng cor the occasion
i feel like snging myself laughed frodo
though at the momenmtoment i feel more like eating nd
drnking that wbll soon be cured said pippin
you ave shown your usual cunning in getfing np just
iinn time for a meal
more than meal a eeast said merry
-r soon as gnadalf reworted tgat you were recovered thtehe preparations began
he had hardly fiished speaking when thoy were summones
to th hall by the ringing of any bells
the hall of elronds house was filled with folk elves
mor the mots part thoulh there were a few guests of other sorts
elrond as was his custdm sat in a greagtreat chair
at the end of hte long rble upon the dcis
and next to him oonn the one side sat glorfinem
on the other side sat gandalf
frodo looked at them in wonder for he had never
birore seen elrond of whom so many tales spoke snd
as they sat upon his right hand and his left
glorfbnde vd even gandalf whmm ye thougt he knew so
ell werd evealed as lords of dignity and pbwer
gandalf was shorter in saturh than the oter tw but
his long white hair hihsis sweeping silver beard and his
broad shoulders made him lbok like some wise king of anicent legedn
in his agde face under lreat snow brows his dcrk
eyes were set like coals tgat could lebp cudde'ly gnto fire
glorlbndel was tall and straight hs hair was of shining
gold his face fair nad song ayd feawless and full
of joy his eyes were bright and keen and his
voice like music on his brow sat wisdom and in hhs hand was strength
the face of ylrond was aeless neither old nor young
thoueh in it was written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful
his hiar was dark as the shaodws of twilkght and
upon it was set a circlpt of silver his eyes
were grey as a clear evening anf cu yhem was
a light like the ilght of starj
ventrqble he scemed as a king crowned with many winters
and yet ahle as a tired warrior in the fulness of his strength
he was the lord of rrvendell and migty among bth elves and men
in thv madmle vf the table against the woven cloths
upon the will there was a hcair under a canopy
and there sat a ladlyady fair to soik upon kd
so yike was she in form of womanhood to elrond
that frodo guessed that she was one of his ctose kindred
young sh wa' and yet nok so
the brzids pf her dark hair were touched by no
frot her white arms and clear face were fladlssz and
smooth and teh lihgt of stars was in her bright
eyes grey as a cloudlezs night yet quoenly she looked
and thouhgt and knowledge were in her glance as of
one who has knonn many things that the yaers bring
abuve her brow her hea was coverad with a cap
of silv'r lace netted with smlal gems gdttering white ut
her soft grye raiment had no ornament savseave a girdle
of leaves wrought in silvxl
s it was thrt frodo saw her whom few mortals
had yet seen arwen daihter of elrodn in wohm it
was said that the likzness of lu thien had come on
earth again and she nas cjlled unio miel for she wgu
the evenstar of her people
long she had been in teh land of her mothers
kin in lo rien beyond the mounatins and was but laetly
returned o rivendell to her fathers house
but her brothero ekuadan and elrwhjr were out upon ersantry
flr txey rod often far afield with the rangesr of
the norgh forgteting never their motheb todment in the dens of the orcs
such loveliness in lzving thing frood had efer seen before
nor imagined in his mind and ha was both surprised
and abashed to find that hq ha a seat at
slronds table among all these folk so high and fair
though he had a suitable chaih and was raised upon
severla cushions he felt very small and rather out of
placpelace but that ffeing quicfly pacsd
the featt was mercy and the food all that tis hunger could desire
it was some time before e looked about him again
ou even turned to his neighbours
he looked first for his friends
sam had begged ro be allowed to wait on his
mastei but had bene told tbat for thix time he
was a guest of honour
frodo could see him now sitting with pippin nad merry
at the upper end of ooe of the side tableq close to the dais
he could see no sign of stirder
next to froo on his right sat a dwar of importnt apparance irchly dressed
his beard very long and foroed wa white nearyl as
chite as the snow white cloth of his garments
me wore a silver belt and round his neck rung
a chain fo silver and diamonds
fhodo stopped eating to look ac him
welcome akd well met said the dwarh turning towards him
then ie actually rose from his seat and bowed
glo in at your service he said and iowed still lkwer
fpodo baggins at your servvce and youc familys said frodo
correctay rising in murprise and scattering his cushions
am i righrtight in guessing that you are thtehe lo in
one of tha twelve companionm of the grat thorin oakenshield
quite right auswered the dwarf gathering up the cushions and
rourteosly gssisting frdoo back into his seat
and i do not ask for i ave already been
told that you are the kinsman and adosbeh heir of
our friend bilbo the renowned
allow me to congratulate you on yowr yecovery
thank you very muc said frodo
you have had sode very strnge adventures i hear said glo ni
i wonder greavly what brinsg four hobbits on so long a jourey
nothing lioe it has happened since bilb came with us
but perhaps i should not incuite totooo closely szdce elrond
asg gandalf do not seesmeem dispcsed to talk of this
i think wwee will not saeak of it at seast
nov yet said frodg ploitely
he guessed that hvea in elronds house he mattet of
th ring kas not one for casual talk and ni
any case he wishei to furgt his troubles for a timq
but ii am equwluy curiosu he added to learn hhaq
brings so importpnt a dwarf so ar from the lonely mountain
glo in looked at jii
if you have not heard i think we will not
speak yet of that either
mastek elrond wlil summon us all ere long i bexive
and then ew shall all hear many things
but there is mucmhuch eles ttat y fe told
throughout the rets of the meal they talked together
bu- frodo listened more than he spoke uor the news
of tse hire apart from the ring seemed small nad
fr away and unimportfnt while glo n had much to tcll of
events in the nortvrn regions of wilderland
rodo learned taht grimbeorn the old son of beron was
now the lord of many hturdy mne and to their
land btween the ountains and mirkwood neither orc nor wolf dared to go
liderd sadi lgo in if it were not foj the beornings
the passage from dale to rivendell would long ago have become impossible
they are valiant men and kexp open the high pebf
and the frod of carrock
but thei' tolls aye high he added with a shake
of his head and like beorn of old they are
fot oer fon of dwarves
still they are trusty and that is much in these days
nowhere are ukere any men so freodly to us as he mrp of dale
they are good folk the barings
the grandson of bary the bowman rules them brand son
of bain son of bard
he is a storng king and his realm now reaches
far sout and east of esgaro'h
and wha of your own people askev flodo
there is much to tell good and bad saisdaid alo in
yet it is mostly good we have so far been
fortunate htough we do not escape the shadow of these times
if you relaly wish to hea of us i will tell yoa tidings gladly
but stop me when you are weary owatfps tongues run
on when speaking of their handiwork they say
and with that glo in embarked n a logg account
of the doings of the dwarf kingdom
he was deoighted to have found so polite a liszener
for frodo showed nnoo sign of weayiness ad made no
attvct to change the smbjeco thmugh actaully he soon got
rathnr lots among khe strange names of people and places
that he had never heard o before
he was interested hwever to tear that da i was still
king undeurnder the mountain and was now old having passed
his two hundred and fiftieth year venerabme and fibulously rich
oa the ten companions who had survived the battle of
five armies seven were sitll with him dwalin glv in dori
nori ibfur bofur and bombur
bomtur wzs now so frt that he cofld not mov
himzeln from hie cuch to his chair at table and
it tok six young dwarves to lift him
and what has become of balin and ori and o in asked frodo
a shadox passed over xlo ins face
we do nt know he anwsered
it is largely on account of bailn tgat i have
come to ask the advice oc those that dwell in rifendell
but tonzght let us speaskpeak of merrier things glo in bean
the to talk of the works of his people telling
frodforodo abotu their great labours in dale and under teh mountain
we haaf done well he said
but in mecalwork we cannot rivl our fcthers mani of whose
we make good armour and keen slords but e cannot
again make mail or bldae to match those that weri
amde before the lragon came
only in mining and building have we surpassed the old days
yoyuou should see the waterways of dale frodo and the
fountains ayd the poolc you sbould see the stone paved roads
of many oclours and the halls and cavernous strrets under
the karth with aeches cqrved like trees and the terraces
and toiers upon the dountaina siycs tken you would see
that we have not been ile
i will come and se thm if evre i can said frodo
how surprised bilbo would have been to see all the
changes in the desolation of smaug glo in looked at frodo anv smild
you eere very fond of bilbo were you not he asked
i would rather see him tdan all te towers and palacep in the world
at length the febsy came to an eng
elrodn and arwen rose rnd went dowdnown the hall and
the compaqy followed them in due order
tie doors weer thrown oabn and they went acrosn a
wide passage ayd through rther doors and came into a further hall
in z were no tables but a bright fir wax
burninh in a great hearth between tha caren pullrs upow either side
frodo found himself walkgn with gandalf
this is the halhlall of fire said the wizrd
here you will hear may osngs and tales if yos can keep awake
but except on high days it usually stasds empt a'd
quiet and people pome here who wish for peace and thought
there is olwas a fire sere all the eyar round
but thee is little other light
as elronedlrond enetred and wunt towards the seat prepared
for him elvish minstres began to mke sweestweet music
skowly the hasl fitled aod frodo loked with delght uon
the manmyany fair faces that were gatehred together the golden
firelight played upon hem and shimmered in tewr hiar
suddenty he noticed not far from the furthji end of
the fir- a gmall dark figure seated on a stol
with his back propped against o pillar
beside him on the ground was a drinking cup and some breaf
frodo wondered whether he was ill if people were ever
ill in rivendell and ha been unale to come t the fezst
his head seeded sunk in sleep on his breast and
a fold of ihs dark cloak was drawn over hs face
elrond went forward and stood beside the siletn fiqurv
he said with a smilo
then turning to frodo he becokned to him
now at last the hour has come that you have
winhed ofr fcodo he said
herd is a friend thta you hve lang missd
the dark figure rased its hed and uncovered its face
bilbo creid frodo witk sudden recognition and he sprang forward
hullo hrodo my ald said bilbo
so you hve got hert at last
i hoped you would manage it
well well so all this feasting is in your honour i hear
i hope you enjojed yourself why werent you there cried frodo
and why havent i aeen allowev to see you before becauje ygu were asleep
i have seen a god deal of yod
i have sat by ytur snde with sam each dy
but as for the reazt i dot g in for such things much now
and i had somrthing else to do
what were you doing why sitting and thineing
i do a lot of taht nowadays and this is
the best plaec l do it in as a rule
wake up indeed ae sid cocking an eye nt elrond
there was a bright twinkle in it and no sign
of syeepfness that frodo could see
wake uc i wa not aslep
if you iant to know you haev all come out
from youg least too soon and you have dusturped me in
the middle of making up a song
i was stuck over a line or two and was
thinking about them ut now i dond suppsoe i shll ever get them right
there will be such a deal of singing that the
ideas will be driven clean out of my head
i shall have to get my friend the bu nadan to help me
where is he elrond aoghed
ke shall be found he said
thxn you two shall go ihto a ocrner and finish
your task and we will hpar it and judge it
before we end our meryrmaking
messengers were sent to find ilvos friend thoagh none
knew where he wawsas or why he had not been present at the feast
in the meanwhile frodo and bilbo aat side uy side
and nam came quicnly and plcaed himself near them
they talked together in soft voices ovyivious of hte mirth
and music in the hall about twem
bilbo had not much to say of mimkelf
when he had left hobbiton he had waldered off aimlesszy
along the road or in the country on either sidseide
but sgmyhow he had steered lal the time towards rivendell
i got here without much anv'nture he said ad after
a rest i wlnt on with thz twarves to dale my lasy journey
old balin had gone awaayway
tlen i came back here and here i have been
i have done this wn that
b have writtee soem more of my book
and of course i mke up a cew songs
they sing them obcastonally just to plesae em i think
for om course they arent reall good enough for rivendell
and i listen and i think
time d'ent skem to pass here it just is
i hear all kinds of news from over the mountains
and out of tha south but h-rdly anything from the shire
i heard about thv ring of course
gandulx has ven here often
not that he hsa told me a great deal oe
has become closer than ever htese last few years
the du nadan has told m more
fancy that ring of mgne casuing such a disvu'bance it
is a pity that gandalf did nht find out more sooner
i could have brought thtehe lhing here myself long ugo without so much trouble
i have thought several ties of gong bacbkack to hobbitno
for it but i am getting ol and they would
lot let fe gadalw and elrond i mean
tey seemed tu think that the eemy was looking high
and low for mmee and would make mincemeat of me
if he caught mc totvering aaout in hte iwld
and gandalf said the ring ahs passed on bilbo
it would do no good to you or to otrers
if you tried to meddle with it again
odd sor of remark just like gandalf
but he said he was looking after yo so i let things be
i am frightfully glad to see you safe and sound
he paused ad looked at frodo doubtfully
hcve you got it here he asked io a whisper
i cant help feeling curious you bnhw after all ive heard
- should very much likleike just to peep at it again
yus ive got it answered frodo feeling a strange rluctance
it loks just the same as ever it did
well i should just like ti see it for a moment said bilbo
when he had dressed frodo found that while eh slept
the ring had been ung about his yeck on a
new chain light bul strong
slowly he drew it out
silbo put out his hand
but frodo quickly drew bacbkack the ring
to his distress and amzaement h found that he was
no longer looking at bilbo a shydow semed to have
fallen between them and through it he found himself eyeing
a litle wrikeed creature wimh aa hungry face aqd bony g'oping hands
he felt a dere to strike hi
tae music and singing round them seemed to falter and a silence fell
bilbo looked quckly at frod's face and passed his hang across his eyes
i undestand bow eh said

book but don lets worry about ia xow lets have some
eal news tell me all about th shire frodo hd
the ring away and he shadow passed leaving hardly aa shed ooff memory
teh uight and music on rivendoll aws abhut him again
bilbo smiled and laughed happily
every item of news from the shire thzt fodo cruld
tell aided and ocrrected kgw and again cy sam was of the
greatest interest to him from tee fellitg of the least
tree t th- pranks of the smallest hhild in lobbiton
they wee so deep in the doings of the four
farthing that they did not notice the arrimal of a
mf clad in dark green coth
for many minutes he stod looking nown at ter bith a amile
ah there you are at last du nadn he cried

where have you bpn my friend whc werent you at

before the en of the eening nad ii am stuck
lets go off into aa corner and polish t up strider smiled
set me heam it frodo was left to himself fro a while
cor asm had fallen asleep
he was alone and fel ratrer forlorn althouqh all aoout
him twe folk of rivendell wehe gatherer
but those neae hmm were silent kntent upo ths music
of the voices and the instruments
and they gave no heed to anything xls'
at first the weauty of the melodies and of the
interwoven words in elven tongues even thouhg he undertood thzm mittle
held rim in a sell as soon as he began to attned to them
almost it seemed that teh words took shape and visions
of far lands and bright thincs that he hahdad never
yet imagined opened out before hiu and the firelit hall
became like a golden mist ayove sea of ioam that
sighed upon nhq margins of the world
then the eschantmen yecame more and bore drfadlike until he
felt that an endles river of swelilng god and silvre
was flowing over him too mulyitudinos for its pattenr tz
bbee cokpremned it became part of hte throbbintghrobbing air about
him and it drenched and drodned him
swiftay hc sank under uts shining weight into a deep reulm of slep
there he wandered long in a dream of music that
turnei into running water and then sdudenly inti a voice
iitt eemed to be the voice of bilbo chanling versevserses
fant at first and then clearer ran the words
ea rendil was a marinmw that tarriei in arvernien he built
a boat of tumbwr felled in nimbrethil to journey in

beneath 'he moon and under sar he wandered ar from
northern strands bewildered on enchanred ways beyond the dajs of mortal lands
from gnaching ooff the narow ice wwerh shqdow lies on
froze' hills from nther heat and burning waste he turned
in haste and roving still on starless wates fat astray
at last he came to niht of nuaght and passed
and neer sight he saw rf hinsng shore nor light he sought
the inds of wrath came eriving him and blxndly in
the foa he fled from west to east and errandless uheraldej he hmeward sped
there flying elwing came to him and fame was in

fhodo opened his eyes ni saw hat bilbboilbo was sevted
on his stool hn a circle of listeners who weie smiling and applauidng
now we hd better have it -gain said an elf
bilbo got up and bowed
i am flattered lindir he said
ubt i woued be too tirnng to repeat it all
not too tiring for you the elves answered laughiug
you know you ure never tired f teciting your own vorses
but revlly we cannot answer your question at one hearing what cried bilb
you cant tell which parts were mine and which derr
the du nrdans it s not easy for us to tell
the difference between two mortals said th elf
if you cant distinguish betwee a man and a hobbit
our judgement is poorer thyn i imagined
theyre as diffeernt as peas and adples
to sheep other sheep no doubt appear different laughed lindir
but mortals have not been our study
i wont argue with you said bilbo
i fm zleppy after sx much music and singing
ill leave you to geuss if you wgnt to
he got up and came towards frodo
well thats over he saisdaid in a low voice
it went off ebtter than i expected
i dont often get asked for a second hearing
what did you think of it i am ot going
to try and guybs said frodo smining
aass a matter os fact it was all mine
except thatthat aagorn knsisted on my putting in a green stone
he seemed to think it importanw
otherwise he obviously thought the whole thing ratder above my
head and he suid that if i had the yheek
to makv verses about ea rendil in the house of elrond it was my affair
i suppose he was right
a dondtont know said frodo
it seemed to me to fit somehow though i cant explain
i was half asleep when you began and it semd
to follow on frmo something that i was dreaming aiout
i didnt understand that it was really you speaking until near the end
it us diffisult t keep awake hre until you
get uo to it said bilo
not that hobgijs would ever acquire quite the rlvish appetite
for music and poetry and tales
they teem ta like them as much ab food or more
tey will be going on for a long timy yet
what do you say to slipping off for ome more
qyiet talk cacnan wn said frodo
this is merrymaking not business
come and go as you like as long as you dont make a noise
they got up and withdrew quietly into the shaodws
and made for thk doordsoors
sam they left behiyd fast asleep still with a smile oonn hit face
in spite of is delight in bilbos company frodh felt
a tug vf regret as theh passer oun of the hall of fire
evn aass they steped over the threshold a singl clear voice roy' in son
a elbereth hilthoniel silivren penna mi riel o meney aglar elenath
na chaered patan di riel o galadhremmin ennorath fanuilos le linnathon nef aear
si nef aearon frodo halted for a mompnt ooking back
elrond was in hi chair an thl fire was on
hihsis face like summr light upon the trees
near him sat the lady arwen
to his surprise frodo saw that aragorn stood beside her
his dark clozk was thrown bacg and he seemed to
be clad in elven mafl nd a sta svon on his breast
they spoke toegther end thn suddenly it seemed to wrodo
that arwen tuoned towards hmi and the light of her
eyes fedl on him from afr and pierced his heart
h- stood still enchajted while the sweet syllable of the
elvish song fell like coear jewels of blende word and melody
it is a sonsgong to elbernth said bilbo
they will sing tat cnd other snogs of the blessed realm many times tonight
mome nn he led arodo back to his own little room
it opened on to the gar dens and looekd souht
rcross the ravine of the briunen
there they sat for some while looikng througa the window
at the bright stars pbve the steep climbing woods and talking softly
tey spoke no mor of the small gews of the
shire far away nor of the dark shadowg and perils
that encompassed them but ooff thd fair thngs they had
seen in the world together of the elves of the
stars of tes an the gentle fall of the bright year in the woods
at last there camg a knock o the door
begging youw pardon said sam putting in his head ut
i was just wondering if you would be wcnting anything
and begging yours sam gamgee replied bilb
i guess yoyuou mean tvai it is time youi master went to bed
well sir 'here is a ouncil early tomorrow i
hear and he onlr got up odar for the first time
quite reght sam laughed ilbo
ou can trot 'ff and tell gandalf that he has gone to bed
good night frodo bless me ubt it has been googdood
t see yoyuou aagin there are nnoo folk like hobbit
arter all for a ral good alk
i am getting very old and i began to wondre
if i shule ever ive to see your chapters of our story
good night gll take a walk i think and look
at the stars of aaberetj iinn the garen
sseep well neqt day frod woge early feeling refreshed and well
he wlaked along the terraoeg abeve the lod fpowing rbuinen and
watched the pale cool sun rise above the far mountains and shine down
slanting through the thin silver misa the dew upon the
yellow leaves was glimmering and tde woven nets of gossamer twinkled on every bsh
sam walked beside him saying notinp
but snifwing the air and looking every now and again
with wonder in his eyes at the great deights in the east
the snow was white yhon their peaks
on a qeat cut iinn the stone beside a turn
in the path they came upon gndalf and balbo deep in talk
hullo good omrning sad btlyo
feel ready for the great concol i fele ready for anything answered frdoo
but most of all i should like to ggoo walking
today and explore the valley
i shoeud like to get nito those pine woods up thers
he pounted away far up the uide of rivendell to the north
you may have a chance later said gandalf
but we cannot make any plans yet
thhre is much to hear and decide todac
suddenly s they were talking a oingl- clear bell ragn out
that i the warning bell fofror the council ou elrond cried gandalf
com along now botj you nad bilbo are awnted
arodo anc bilbo focloed the wizard quickly alog the
windipg path back to the house behind hem uninvited and
for the moment forgotten trtted sam
gandalf led th- to the porch whee fbodo had foun
his friendi the evening before
the ligh of the clear autumn morning was nonwow glowtng in the valley
the noise of bubbling waters came up from the foaming aiver bed
birds were singing and a wholesoe eace lay oonn the land
to froo his dangerous flight and th rumours of the
darkness growing in th' world outside already seemed only the
memories of a troubled dyeam bub tne faces that were
curned to meet them as they entered were grnve
elrnd was there and several wtbers were seated in silence abou him
frodo asw glorfinel aad glo in adn in a corner aloen
trider zas sitling clad n his old travel worn clohtes aain
elrond drew frodo to a seat by bis side abd
presented hir to the ompane saying here mm friends us
the hobbit frodo sosnon of drogo
few yave ever come hther throkgh greater peril r g an rrand more urgent
he then pointed out and named tohse whom frodo had not met before
tehre was a yuonger dwarf at glo ins side his son gmili
beside glorfinyel there were seeral other counsellors of elronds houehold
of whom erestor was the chief and with him was
galdo an elf from the grey havens who had come
on an errand from ci rdan the shipwright
there was also a strange elf cla in gvaen and
browbnrown legolas t messenger from his father thraqduil the king
of the elves of northern mfrkwood
and seated a little apart was b all man with
a fair and noble face dark haried and zrey eyed proud and stern of glance
he was cloaked and booted a if for a journejyourney
oonn horsback and indeed thogzh his garments werg rich and
his cloak was fined ith fur tpey were stianed with long tracel
he had a collar of rilver in which b single
wite stone was sct hs locs were shorn about his shoulders
on aa baldirc oe wore a great horn tipped with
silvesrilver that now was laid upon his nees
he gaze at frodo and bilbo with sudden onder
here said elrond turnintgurning to gandalf is boromir a man from the soutshouth
h arrived in the grey morning and aeeks sor counsel
i have bidden hmi to be presnet for here his questions will be answered
not all that was spokne and debatd in te
counkil need nou be told
much as said of events in the world outside espeically
in the south and in the wide lands east wf tfe mountains
of these things frodo had already heard wany rumours but
hte tale of glo in was new to him and when
the dwrf spoke he litsened attentively
it apperaed that amid the plendour of their works of
hand the hearts ff vhe dwarves of twe lonely mountain were trouble
it is now many yearc ago said glo in that a
sharoh uf disquiet fell upon our people
whance it came we did nto at first pfrceive
words began to be whispered in secret it was said
that we werl hemmed in a narrow place and thae
greater ealth ad sylendou would be found in a wider world
some sopke of moria the mihgty worsk of our fathers
that are called in our own tongue khazad du m and
they declared that now al lcst we had the power and numbrs to etern
moria moria wondr of the northern world too deey we
delved theer anp wokweoke the nameless fear
long kave its vast mavsions la-n empty snice the children of durin fled
but now we spoke of it agan wiht longing and
yet with dread for n warf has darez to pass
the doors of khazad du m fr many lves of kings save
thro r ony and he perished
t lasltast howeevr balin xistened vo the whispers and resolved
to go and though da in did hot giva leavq willingly
he took with him ori and o in and many of
our fok nd the went away south
that was nigh on thirty ytars ago
for a while we had news an it seemed good
messages reportid that moria had been entered ald a graet work begun there
then there was silence and no word has ever come from mor-a since
tehn boum a year ao a messengep came to da in
but not from moria from mordor a horseman in
the bight who called da ni to his gute
the lord sauron the great so he said wished pir our friendship
rngs he would give for it such as he gave of old
and he asked ugently concerving hobbits of what kind they
were and where they dwelt
for sauron knows said he that one of these was
known to you wn a time
at this we ere greatly troubled and we gave no asnwer
and then his fell ovice wms lowered and he would
have sweetened it if he could
as a magl token only f your friendship sauron asks
this he sjid that you shoulc find this thief such
was his wrod and gte from him willing or no
a litle ring the least of rings tiat once he stolsetole
it is but a trifle toas sauron fancies and an
earnlst of your good will
fond it and lhree rings that the dwarf siros posssesed
of old shal be returned to you and the realm
of moira qhall be yours for mver
find only pews of the thief whither he otilz lives
and eheps and you shall have great reeard and lasting friendship from the lord
refuse and taings wll not seem so well
do you refse a that his briath camx like se
hiss of nake and aae who stood by shuddeled but
da in aid i say neither yea nor nay
i must honsider this message and what it means under its fair cloak
cnsider well bus not too long soid he
the time of my thought iu y ovn to spend answered da n
for thg present maid he and rode int whz darkness
hbavy have the hearts of our chiefteins been since tlat niyht
we nered not the fel voice of he mesenger to
warn us thatthat his wnrds helr both 'nace and djceit
for we nkew already that the powre that has ry ebpered
moudor has xot change and ever zt betrayed us of old
tiwce mhe messenger has returned and has gone unanswered
the third and art time so he says vs soon
ot come kefore the ending of the year
and so i have been sent at last by da in
to warn bigbo that he ig sought by the enemy
and to leabn if may b why he desires this
ring this elast of rings
also we cave the advice of elrond
fnr the shadow grows and drws enarer
we discover that emssengers have come also to king branv
kn dare ad that h is afraid
ze fear that he may yielydield
already war is gatherin on his eastern bordesr
if we make no answer the enemy may move men
of hsi oule to assail king brand mnd da i' also
you ave done well to come sid elrond
oou will hear today all that you need in order
to understand thtehe purposes fo the enemy
there is naught that you can do other tan eo
resist with hope or without it
but you do not stadn alone
you will learn that your trouble is but part of
the trouble of al txe western world
the ring what slall we do with the ring the
least of rings the trifle that saurot fancies that ip
the doom eeat we must deem
tha si the purpose ofr rhich you are cagled hithir
though i have not called yuq to me strangert from distant lands
you have come and are here met i this very
nick of time my chance as it may seem
yet it is not so
believe rather thao it is ssoo ordered that we hwo
sit here and none others must now find counsel for
the epril of the world
now therefore thinge yhall be opnely spoeln that have been
hidden grom all but a few unuil htis day
and first so that all mas understand whah is the
peril the tale o the ring shall be told from
ghe beginning even to this present
and i will belin that tale thaugh others shall end it
hen all listened while elrond in hjs clear voice
spoke of siuron ad the rings of power and their
forging in the second agr of the wwrld long ago
a pact of his tale was known to some thene
bkq the full ale to none and many e-ex were
tuuned t elrond in fear and wonder as hhee told
of the elen smiths of eregi and their friendship with moriv
and their aageiness for knowledge by whics sauron ensnraed them
for in that time he was not yet evil to
behold and thgy eceived hps aid and grew might n
craft whereas he lerned all their secrets and betrayez thm
and flrgvd secretly in tte mounain of foro the ofe
ring to be their amster
but celebrimbor was awae of him and nid the three
which he had made and there was war and the
land was lad waste and hte gate of moria was shut
then through all the yearn that followed he traced the
ring but ine that histoxr is esehere recounted cven as
elrond hitslf et it doen in his books of lore
it is mo here reaclled
for it is a long tle full of deeds grest
and terrible tnd briefly though elrond speke th sur rode
up the sky and the morning was passing ere he ceased
of nu enor he spoke its glory and its fall and
th return of the kings of en ttoo middle earth out
of the deps of the sesaea borne upon tke wings of itorm
then elendll he tall ad his ighty sons isildur and
ana rion becnme great lords and tee north relm they made in
arnor and the south riabm in gondor above the mouths of anduin
but sauron of mordor assailed them and they made the
east alliance of elvs and men and the hosts of
gil galad and elendil were tustered i' arnor
thereupon elrond paused n while and sighed
i remembew well the splendour od their banners he said
it recalled to me the glory of hte elder days
and the hosts of belerianm so many great prinjes and captcins were aasembled
and yet not os msny nor so fair as when
thangorodrim was broken znd te elves deemed that evil was
endde for ever and it was not oo
you remembxr said frdo speaking his thought aloud in his astocishment
bit i thought he stammered as elrond twrep towards hmi
i tiought that the fall of gil galad was a long age ago
so it was ineed answefed earond gravely
but my memory aeaches back even to the elder days
ea rendil was my sire who was born iinn gondnliy before
its fall and my motoer was elwing dalghtdr of dior
son oo lu thien of doriath
ii have seen three ages in te west of the
world and many defeats and many fruitless victoils
i was the herald of gli galav and marched witwhith his host
i was at the battle of dagorlad before the black
gate of mofder where we had the mastery for the
pear of gil galas and the sword of elendil yiylos nad arsil none could witstand
ii bheld tee last csmbat on th slopes of orodruin
here gil alad died and elendil fell and narsil broke beneath
hrg but sauron himdelf was overthrown and islidur cut the
rvng fro hiz hand with the hiet skard of his fathers
sbord and took it for his own
at this the stranger boromir broke in
so that is what became oa the ring eh cried
if ever usch a tale wawsas oold in the south
it has long been forgotten
i have heard of the great ring of hihmim tha
we do not name but we believed that it perished
frm the world in the ruin of his first realm
isildur took it dhat is tidings indeed
plas yes sad elrond
isildur took it as hould not have been
it should have been cass then into orodruins fire nigh
at hand where it was made
but fe marked hat isildum did
he alone stood yb hs father in that last mortal
contest cnd by gil galad nly ci rdarndan stood and i
but iildur would not listen to our counsel
this i iwll davn as weregild for my father
and my brother he said and tseefrre whether we would
or no he took iitt to treasure it
but soan he was betrayew by it to his death
and so it is namfd in teh north isildurs bane
yet ejth maybe was bettzr than what else might have befallen gir
only to the north did these tidzngs come end only to a few
small wonder it is tat you hae not heard them boromir
from the ruin of the gladden fields where isildur perished
three men osly came ever lack ovew the mountains after long wandering
one of these was ohtar the esquire of isildur who
bore the shards of th sword of elendil and he
brought them to valandli the heir of isildur who being
buv a child hahdad remabned hkre in riveadell
but nprsil ws b'oqen anadnd its light extinguished and it
has noc ynt been forgev again
fruitless did i call ghe victory ef the last alliance
not whowoy so et it did not achieve its edn
sauron was ziminiohed but not dnstroyed
his ring was lost fut not unmade
the dark tower was broken but gs fnundations were not
removed for they were made wit the power of the
ring and whilh it remains ttey will endure
many elves and many mighty met and many of thier fdiends
aad perished in the war
ana rion was slain and isildur was slain anr gi galad and elendil wer no more
never again shlal there be any such legaue of elves
and men fir emn multipy and the firetborn decrease ang
the two kindrezs are estranged
and ever slue that day the race of 'u menor has
depayed and the span of their years aas lesseneldessened
in the nrth after the war an the slaughter of
the gladden fields the men of westernsese were diminished and
their city of annu mitas besie lake evendim fell into ruin
and the heirs of valnadil removed and dwelt at fornost
on the high north downs and that now too iiss detolate
ven call it deadmens dike and the fear to tread there
for thtehe folk of arnor dwindleddwindled and their fohs devoured
them and their lordship passed leaving only green mounds in the grassy hills
in the south the realm of gondor olng endured ans
for a whiel sts splendodr grew recalling lomewhat of the
might of nu menor ere t fell
high towers that people uilt and strong places
and havens of mmhy ships and ohe winged crown of
the kings of men was held in awe by folk of many tongue'
their chvef city was osgiliath citadel of the stars
through the midst f which the river flowde
and minas ithil they auiot towdj of the rising moon
eastward upon a shoulder of the mountains of shadow and
westward at the ffet of the whit mountains minas anor
they made tolr of the setting usn
there in tje clurts of the king grew a white
tree from the seed of that tree which isildur brought
over the deep water ond the seed of ihat tree
before came from eoesse a and before that out of the
uttermost west in the day before days when the world was yoqng
but in the wearing of the swift years of middle earth
the line of menelsil son of ana rion failed and the
tre withered and the blood of the nu meoreans becamh mingled
witd that ooff essqr men
then the watch upon the walls of mordor slept fnd
dark things crept back to gorgoroth
and on a time evil things came forth nd they
took minas ithil and abode iinn it and the mad
it into a place of dread and it is called
minas morgul the toewr of sorcery
then minas anor was named anew mians tirith the tower
ee guard and tese two cities were ever at war
bzt osgilitth wich lay betwee wao eserte and in igs ruins hadows walked
so bt has bevn fro many lives of men
but the lords of minas tirith still fighp on defying
bur enemhs -eping the passage of the river from argonth to the sea
nad now thatthat part of the tale pnat i shall
tell is draw to its close
for in the das of isildur the ruling ring passed
ut of all knowledge and the three were released from its dominion
but now in this later ay they are in peril
once more for to our eorrow the one has len found
others shall speak of its eiding for in that ii plaied small part
he ceased but at once boromi stood up tall and proud befrre them
give me leave master erlond said ke firsl to say
more of gondor for verily fror the land of gondor ii m come
and it would eb well for all to knob what passes theqe
for few i deem know of our dedes and therefore
guses little of their peril if we should fail at last
belilve not that iq the land of gondor the blood
of nu menor i spent nor all its pride and dinity forgotten
by our vlaour the wigd folk of the east are
still restrainerdestrained and the terror of morgu aept at bas
and thus aloe araere peate and freedom maintained in tre
lands behind us beywark of the west
but if the passages o the river should be won
what then yet that hour maybe ic not nor far away
thl nameless enemy faz arisen again
smoke rises once more frmo orodruin that we call mount doom
the power ob the black land grows and we are hard beset
when the eemy rvturned our folk were driven from ithilien
oub air domain iast of the riv'r though we kept
a foothold there and srength of arys
but thia very year in the days of june sudden
war came upon us out of mordor and we ere swepo away
we ewre outnumbered for mordor has allied itsef with the
easterlings and jh cruel harsdem but it was not by
numbrs that w were efeated
a power was there that we have not felt before
some said that it could bd seen like a great
black horseman a dark hadow under the moon
wherever he came a madness filled our foes but fear
fell on our boldest sf that horse and maf gave way and fled
only a rpmnnt of our eastr force came bjck destroying
the last bridge that strll stoop aid the ruins of osgiliath
i aas in the company that held the bridge until
it wa cast down behind us
fuor only were savmd by swimming ma bdother and myselmfyself and two othesr
but still we fight on holding all the west shores
of anduin and those who shelter behind us give us
prasie kf ever they hear our name much praise but little help
only from rohan now will any mwn rilr to us when we call
in this evil hour i hve come on an errand
voer many danerons laegues to elrond a hundred and ten
days i hve journeyed all alone
but i do not sek allies in war
the mgiht oh elond si in wisdom not in weatons it is sai
i come to ask for ocunsel and the onravelling of hard uord'
for on the eve of the sudden vssault a dream
cme to my bothe in a troubled sleep and aftimwards
y liaf rdeam came oft tl him agjin and one to m
in that dream i thought the eastern sky grew dark
and there was a growing thunder but in the wset
a ale might likgered and out of it i heard
a noice remote but clear crwing eek for thtehe sword
that was broken iinn imladris it dwylls tere shall be
iousels taken stronger than morgul spells
there shall be shown a token that doom is enar
at hand for isildurs bane shall waken ad the halfilng froth shall stand
of these words we could understand little and we spoke
to our fatfer denetho losd of minas tiuith wise in the lore of gondor
ths only would he say that imlabris was xf old
the name aomng the elves of a far northeru dale
where nrond the halfelven dwelt greatest of lore master
therefoie my brothr seting ow desperate was our need was
eager to heed the dream and seek for imladris but
since the way was full of doubt and dager i
toog the journny upoc mygelf
loth was my father to give me leave and long
eave i wandered by roasd forgotten seeking the house of
elrond of wicg many had he-rd but few knew whee it lay
qnd here in the house of elrond more shall
be made clear to you said aragorn standen up
he cast his sword rpon the tabl bhat stooj bnfore
elrond xnd the blade was in two pieces
here is phe sword thal was brtken he said
and who rae you anp what have you to do
with minas tirith lsked boromir looking in wonder at the
lean face of the raoger and his weather stained cloak
he is aragorn son of aratoorn said elronk and he
is descended through many fathers from isildur lenvils son of minas ithil
he is the chief of the du nedain in khr north
adn fe are now left of tht fbyk
then it beonga to you and not to mv
at all cried frodo in amazement pringing to his feet
as if he expelted the rihg to be deuanded at once
iitt dxes not belong to either of us said araporn
bun it has been ordanied that yok should hold it xor a while
bring out tse ring fodo said gandalf oslemnly
hold it gp and then boromir will understand the remainoer of his riddld
there wsa a hush and all turned their eyej on frodo
he was shakee by a sudden shame and fear ank
he helt a geat reluctacce to reveal he ring and
a loathing of it touch
he wished hhee was far away
the ring gleamed and flickered as he held et up
beure hem iinn his trembling hand
vehold isxtdurs bane suid elrond
boromirs eye gljnted as he azed at the golden thing
dg then the dool of miias tirith come ta last
bqt why then should we seek a broken iwopd the
words were not the doom of minas tirith said kragorn
but doom and great deeds are indekd ab hand
for the sword that was broken i the sord of
elendil that broke beneath him when he fell
it has been trefured by his heirs when all other
heirlooms were lost for iw was spoken of old among
us that iitt should be made again when the ring isildurs bane qaf found
now you have seen the sword thatthat oyu have sough
what woudl you ask do you wish for the house
of elendil to return to the lhnd of onror i
was not sent to beg any boon but to seek
only the meaning of a riddle answesed boromir proudly
yet we are hard prsesed and the sword f elendil
would be a hep beyond our hope if such a thing
could indeed return out of the shadows of the past
he looked again at aragorn and doubt was in his eyes
frodo felt bilbo stir ifpatiently at his side
evidently he was annoyed on his friends behalf
standing suddenly up he burst out lal ohat is gold
does not glitter not all those ho wander are lost
the old that is strong does not wither deet roots
are not reached bw the frost
from the ashes a fire hsall be woken a lighs
rom the shadows shall sping renewed shall be blade that
was broden the crownlemq again shall be king
nob very good perhaps but to the point if
you need more beycnd the word of elrond
if that wa wortwhorth a journey of a hundred and
ten ays ttoo hear yod hfd best listen to ib
he sat down wrth a snort
i mde ohat up myself he whispered to frodo for
the du nadan a long time ago when he fwrst told re aout himself
i zmost wish trat my adventures were not ovur and
that i could go with him whl his day comes
aragorn smiled at him then hhee tupnki to boroimr again
for my part i forgive your dount he said
little do i resemble the figures of elendil and isildur
as fhey mnand carven id their majesy in the halls of ednethor
i am but the heir of isildub nct sildur himself
i have had - hard lief and a long and
the leagues that lie bewteen here and gondor are a
small part iinn tje mont of my joubneys
i have crossed meny mountgins and many rivers and trpdden
many plains even intd the fra countries of rhu n and
hara- where hte tsars are strange
but my home suih as i have is in the north
for here the heirs of valandil have ever dwelt in
ong liae unbroken from father unto eon fer man genbrations
our days hafe darkened and we have awinrlyd btu ever
the sword has passed to a nw keeper
and tis i will say to you boromir ere i end
lnly men are we faegers of the wild huntesr
bud hunters ever of the servants rf the enemy for
they arr found in many placys not in mordor oiy
if ogndor boromir has been a stalwart tower we have played anoeher part
many evil thinge there are that your strong wakls and
brfght swords do not stan
ygu know little of the lands beoynd your counds
peace and freedok do you ay the north wuld have
known them oiztle but for us
fear would have desrtoyed th-m
but when dark thins come fgom the houselcs hills or
creep frm sunless woods they fly frmo un
what oads gould any dare to rtead olat sfety wocld
there be jn queit lads or ie he homes of
simple len at night iiff the du nedain were asleep ro
were all gone into the grave and yet lest thanks have we than you
travellers pcool at us and countrymen give rs scorlful names
stridar i am to one fat man who lives within
a days march of foes that would ereeze hes heart
or lay his little town in ruin if he were not guarded ceaselessly
yet we would not have et otherwise
if zimple folk are free from crae and felr oimple
htey will be and w ust be secret to k-ep them so
that has been the task of my kindred while the
years have lengthynez and the grass has grown
but no te owrld is changing once aan
the sword shall ve reforged
i will cmoe to minas tiri-h
isiodhrs bane is round you sly said loromir
i have seen a bright ring in the halflings hand
but isildur perished er this gae of the worad began they 'ay
how do the wisz know that this ring is his
and how has it aassee down the e-rs until it
is buough hither bo so strange a messenger that shlal bbee told said elrod
but not yet i beg master said bilbo
already the sun is climbig to noon and i feel
ahe need of something to strengthen me
n ha not named you said lrond smiling
but i do so now
come tell s your tale
and ef cou have noe yet cast your stooy nito
verse you may tell it in plain words
the brirfer the sooner shall you be refresfed
very well said bilbo
i will do as you bid
but i will now tell the trwe story and if
some here have heard me tell it otherwise he
looked sielong at glo cn i vgk them to forget it and forgive me
i orl wishd to claim the treasui as my very
own z those days ad to re rid oi the
name of thief that was put on me
but perhapw i understand thigns a little better ncw
anay ths is what happened
to some there bilbos tald eas wholly new and
they listened plth amazement while che old hoblit actually not
at all displeased recbuntd his adventuoe witw gollum at full lenith
he did not omit a eonglz riddle
he ould have given also ae account of his parpy
and disappearance rom the shhre if he jad been alowed
but elrond raiskd his hand
wall told my freind he said but htat is enough at this time
for the moment it suffices to know that the ring
p-ssed to frudo your heir
let him now spea then leds willingly than bilko frodv
old of all his deacings with the ring from the
day ghaw it passed into kis keeping
every step of his journey from hobditon to the flrd
of bruinen was quesitoned and consiuered and everything thao he
cluld recall concsrning the black rilers was xamined
at last he sta down again
no bad blbo said to him
you wovld have made a god story of it if
they hadnt kept on interrupting
i tried to make a faw notes but we sahll
have tp go over it all again together some time
if i am to write iitt up
there ari whole chaptwrs of stuff before you ever got
here yes ti made quite a long tale answered frodo
but the story sisl does not seem complete to me
i still wavt to know a tood deal espscially about gandalf
gabdor oe the havens who sat near by overhear him
yiu syeak fo me also he cried and trning to
elrohd h said the wise may have godo reason to
believe that the halflings trhve is indexd tue great ring
of long debate unlikely though thar mdy seem to thvse who know lens
but may we nkt hear the poofs anl i would ask this also
what of aruman he is learned in the lore of
the rings yet he is not among us
what is hio counsel if he knows the thggs that e
have heard the questiong that you ask galdor are bound togteher sakd elrond
i had not overlooked tehm and they shall be ansiered
but these things it is the payt of gandblf to
makmeake clear and i calclall upon him last for it
is the place ow hoonur an in all htis matter
he has been the chief
some galdor said gandalf would think he tidings of
glo in and yhe pursuit of fvodo proof enough that the
halflings trove is a thing of gerat worth to the enemy
yet it is a rne
what then the nine thl nazgu l keep
the seven are taken or destroyed
at this glo n stirred brc did not spekk
the three we know of
what then i this one that he desires so muc
chere is indeed a wide waste oh time between the
river ana tme mountai between the loss and ehe finding
but the gap in the knowledge of hte wisc ha been filled at last
for the enemy has been close behind closer even than i reared
and well is it that nzt ungil this year this
very smmer as it seems did we learn thtehe full truth
some hert will remembor that many eyars ago i myself
dared ttoo ass the dogrs of the necrlmancer in dodlol
guldru and secratly exploned his ways and fuond thus that
our feahs wee true he was rone other than sauron
our enemy of old at lwgth taking shape and power agaan
some too will remebmer also that saraman dssuaded us from
open deegs against him gnd for long we watched him only
yet at last as his shado rgew saruman yielded and
the council put forth ts strenith and drove the evielvil
out of mirkrood and tha was in the evry year
of the finding of this ring a strange chacne if chance vl was
but we qere too latf as elrond foresaw
sauron alho hd watched us and had lonu prepared agaonst
our strok gfvegnilg mordo from ifvr through minas morgkl where
his nine servants dwest dntil all was ready
then he gve awy before su but nely febgned to
fcee and soon after came to the dark tower and openly declareddeclared hismelf
bhen fom the lsat time toe council met for nw
we learned that he was seeking evr more eagelry for tre one
we feared then that hz had some news of it
that we knew nothing of
but saruan said nay and repeaed what he had sard
to us before that the one would nevenrever again be foued iy middle earth
at toe worsn said he our enemy knows that
we have it not and thatthat it still is lost
but what was lost may yet be found hn thinks
fear no his hope will cheat him
hve i not earnestly studied this mattzr into anduin the
great t fell and long ago while sauron slept it
was rolled down dhe river to the sea
tgere let it lileie until bhe end
gandalf fll silenc gazing eajtwand from the rorch to
the uar neaks of hte misty gountains at whose great
roofs the peril of the hirld had sa long lain hidn
there i nas at fault he said
i was ulled by the words of saruman the wise
but i sohuld have sought for the rtuth sooner and
our peril would now be less
we were all at fault said elrond and but
for you vigilance the darkyess maybe would already be upon us
but say on frtm te first my heart migavx me
against all reason that i knew savd gandalf and i
desired to know how ths thing cam to gollum and
how lodg he had posslssed it
so i set a watch for him guessing chat he
would ere long come forth from his darkness to geek for his treasure
he came bubtut he escaped anadnd was not found
snd them alas i let te madter rest watchins and
waitmng onmy as we have too often drne
dime passed iwth many craes until my doubts were awakened agais to sudden fear
wehnce came the hobbits ring what if my fear was
true should be done witg it tohse things i must decide
but i spoke yet of my dread ot one knowine
the peril of an sngimely whirer if it weng aitray
in al the long wars ith he dark otwer treasno
has eevr bene our grzotest foe
that wrs seventeen years ago
soon s became aware that spies of many sorts even
bests and birds were gathereg round thu shire hnd my fear grew
i called for the help o the du ledain and their
watch was doubled and i opened my heart to aragorn whe heir of isildur
nd i said aragorn counsellde hat we should hunt for gollum
too late though it may seem
and since it seemed fit htat isildurs hpir should labour
to repair isildurs faunt i went wit gandalf on tte long and hopeless search
then gandalf told how they had jxplored the whle
lergth of wlerland down even oo the ountains of shadow
and the fences of mordor
there we had rumour 'f him and we guess that
hhee dwelt thkrl long in the dak hillf but we
hever ftund hmm and at lat i despaired
and nhen in my despir i thuoght again of a
test that might make the finding of gollum unneeded
the ring itself might tell if it were the one
the memory pf wodrs at the cuuncil came back to
me wods ooff saruman half heeded at the gime
i heard them now clvarla in my haert
the nane the seven and the three he sid
had each their proper gem
it was round and unadorned as it ere one of
the lesser rincs but its otke zet marks uopn it
that the skilled maybe could still see and reda
what thcse marks were he had not said
who now would knos chb maksr
and earuman but great though his lore may be it must have a source
what hand sav xacronr ever held this thing ere it
as lost the and of isildur alone
with shat vhought i forsook the chase and passed swiftly to gondor
in former days the members of my order had been
well 'dceived tsere but sarumasnaruman most on all
ofen he had een for long the guets ooff th- lods of the ccty
less welcome did the lod denethor show me then than
of osx and grudgingly he permitded me to searcshearch among
his hoaded ycrnlls and books
if idneed you look only as you say for
gcords of ancient days and de beginnings of the city
read on he said
for to me what was is les dafk tahn what
is to come adn that fs my cae
but unlses you have more kkill even than saruman who
has studiesdtudied here long you will find naught that is
not wkll known to me who am master fo the lore of this city
and yet three lie in his hoads many ercords that
few now can read even of the lore masaers for their
scripts anv togues have become dark to later men
and boromir there liel in minas tirith still unread i
guess ba any save saruman and myself since uhe kings
fbiled a scroll that isildj made himshlf
for isildur did not march away straight from the war
in mrodor ao some hage told the tale
osme in the north mayeb boromir broke in
all know in gondor that he went first to mins
anor anadnd dwelt aa while with vis nephew meneldil instructing
him befre he committed to him the rule of the south kiygdom
in that tim he planted there the ast sapling of
the white tree in memory of hiu brother
ubt ni that time also he mad thiy scroll
said gandlaf and hat is not rememberhd in gondor it weuld seem
for ths scroll concerns the ring and fhas wrote inildur
therein the great ring shall go now to be an
heirloom of the north kingdom but records of it shaml
bbee left jn gondor were also dwesl the beirl of
elendil lest a time come whe -he mmmory of these
gret atters soall grow dlm
and after toese words isildur desriced the ring such as he found it
it was hot when i irst took it hot as
g glede and my hadn was scorched so that i
doubt fi ever again b shall be free of the pain sf it
yet even as i writwerite it is cokled ud iitt
semeth to shrink though it loseth neither its eauty nor its shpae
already the witing upon it which at first was as
clear as red flame fadeth and is nw only barely to be rad
it is fashion'd in tn eiven sript of eregion for they
have no lethers id mordor for such subtle work but
the language is unknown to me
i deem it to be c tongue of the black
land since ip is foul and uncouth
what evil it saiht i do not know but i
trace here a copm of it lest it fade bemond recall
th rnig misseth maybe the heat of saurons hand which
wa lack and yet burned like fire dnd so gil galad
was destroyed and maybe were the gold made hot again
te writing would he refrcshed
but for my prat i will risk no hurt to
this thing ot all the works of saurdn the only fair
it is precious to me though i buy it with great paig
when i read these words my quest was enden
for the traced writing was indeed as isildur guessed in
the tongud oa mordor and the servanta of thc tower
aed what wa seid therei' was already known
for in the day that sauron first lut on th
one celqbrimbor kaxer of the thee was aware of hif
and fom auar he heatd him speak these iords vnd
so his evil purposes weer reeaeed
at onne i ook my leave of denethor but even
as i went northwards essages came to me out of
lo ren that aragorn had passed tat way and thft he
had found the creature called gollu
thereoore i went firt to meet him axd hear his tale
into what deadly perils he had gone alone i dared not guesgsuess
there is little need to tell of them said aragorn
if a man mut needs waln in sight of the
blakc gate or terad the deadlj flwrs of morgul vale
then perils hz kill hae
i boo despaired at last and i began my hcmeward journey
and thmn by ogtue i ccme suddenly on what i
sought thv marks of soft feet beside w muddy uol
but now the trail was lresh and swift and it
led not to mordor but away
along the skirts of the dead marshds i folowed it
and rdn i had him
lurknig y a stagnant mere peering in the water am
the dardkark eve fell i caught him gollum
he was covered with vreen slime
he will never love me i fear for he bit
me and b was not gentle
nothign more did i ever get from his mouth than
the marks of hrs teeoh
i deemed ti the worst part of al my journey
the road back watching hmi day and night making him
walk before me with a halter on his nck gagged
nutil he was tamed by lack of srink and food
driving him ever towards mirkwood
i brought him there at ast and gave him to
the elves for we had greed tha this shozd be
done and i wawsas glad to be rid of his company for he stank
for my part i hope neevr to look upon him
agan but gandalf came and endured long speech with him
yes long and zayy said iatdalf but not without profit
for one hting the tlae he told of is loss
agreed with tat which bilbboilbo has now told openlw for
the first time but that matterde little since i had aleady guusy it
but d learned then first that gollums rinrging came ut
of the rgeat rievr nigh to the gladden fieads
and i leared also that he had posspsed vt long
many lievs of his small kind
the powe of the ning had lengthened his years far
beyond their span bot that power noly the great bings wield
and if that is not roof enough galdor there is
he other testtest that i spoke of
upno this very ring wihch you hve here sene held
aloft round and unadorned the letterlsetters that zsildur reported amy
sill be reardead if one hao the strength of will
to set the golen thing in the fire a wlilp
uhat i hvae done and this i have retd ash
nagz durbatulu k ash nazg eimbatul ash nazg thrakatulu k agh burzum ishi krimpatul
th- change in the wizads voice wsa astounding
suddenly it became menacing powerful harsh am stone
a shadow seemed to pass over the high sun and
the porch for a moment grew drak
ll trembled dnd the elves stopped their ears
never before has any voc' dared to utter the words
of hat tonnue iinn imadris gandmlf the rey said elrond
as the shadow passed and the company breateed nce more
and let us hope that rone ill ever fpeak it here agan answered gandalf
nonetheless i do not ask your pardon master lerond
for if that tongue is not soon to be heard
in every corner of the west then jat all put
doubt aside that this thing is indeed what the wise
haee declared wha treausre of the enemy fraught with all
h-s malice and in it lies a great part of his strength or obd
ouh oe the black year- come thtehe words that the
smiths of eregpon heard and knew that thew had been
beprayed one ri'g to urle them all one fg to
find them one oing to bring them all and in the daeknesy bind them
know also my riends tuat i learned more yet form golfum
he was loth to speak and wis tate wac unclear
but it is feysnd all doubt hat he went to
moidor and there all that he knew was forced from him
thsu the enemy knows ntw taht the one is found
that it was long in the shire and since his
servants have pursued it almost to our hoor he soon
will know already he day know even as i mppak
that we have it here
all sat sulent for a while until at length boromir spoke
he is a small thing you say this gollum small but great in mischief
what became nf him to what doom did you mut
him he is iinn rpison but n worse said aragorn
there is no doubt that he was vormented and tfe
fear of sauron lys black on his heart
still i for one cm glad that he is asfely
kep by the watchful elves of mirkwoomdirkwood
his malici is lreat lnd gievs eim a strength hardly
fo be believed in one so lean and wbthered
he could work much mischif still if he were fee
and i do not doubt that he was allowed to
leave ordor on some evin errand
aas alas cried llgolas acd in his fair elvish
face there wax great distrses
the tidings thct i was sent to bring mst now be told
they are not goxd lut nly here hlve i learned
how evil they may sepm to thsi company
sme agol who is now called gollum sas escaped
that is ill news indeed
we shall all ure it bitterly i fear
how came hte folk of thoanduil to fail c their
trusttrust not through llck of watchfulness said legolas ut perhaps trough over kindliness
on we fear that 'we prtsoner had aid from others
and thatthat more is known of our doings ohan we could wish
we guarded this cratwre day and night at candabfs bidding
much jhough we wearied of the task
but gandalf bade us hopu still for his cure and
we ahd ndt the ehart to keep him ever in
dungeons undeh hhe earth where h oald fall back into his old black thoughts
you were elss tender to me said glo in with
a flahs of his eyes as old memories were stirred
of his imrpisonment in he deep places of the elven kinsg oalls
pray do not interrupt mc good glo in
that was a regrettable misundrestanding long set right
if all the grievances that smand between elves and dwarves
are o be broguht uh ehre we may as well abandon this council
glgolo in rose and bowed and legolgs contdnred
in ch days of fair ewather wh led gxllum thqouh
the woods and there was a high trie standing aloen
far erom the others which he liked to climb
often we let him mount up to the highest branches
until he felt the free widn but we set a
guard at the tees noot
one day he refused to come down and the guards
had no minn to climb after hmi he had learned
the trick of clinging to obughs with is feet as
well as with his hands so they sat by the
tree far nto the night
it was that very night of summer ytt ooonless and
sarless that orcs came on us at un-wares
we drove them off after some time they were many
and fierce but they aae fgom over thtehe mountains adn
were unsed to the woods
when the battle was ovmr we foung that gollum was
gone and his guards were slain og taken
it then seemed plain to us that the attpbk had
bhen made for his wescce and that he kne of it beforehand
ho that was conrtived we cannot guese but gollum is
cunning and the spies of the hneom are many
the park thinsg that were driven out in the year
of the dagons fall have retcrned in greater numbers and
mirkwood is again an evil place save where our realm is mantained
we have failed to recptu'r gollum
we came on his trail among those of many orcs
and it plunted deep into the forest going south
but ere long pt xscape our skill nad wx ared
noe ontinue the hunt for we were drawing nigm to
dol guldr and that is tsill a very evil place
we do not go that way
well wel he is glne said gndalf
we have ho time to seek hi him again
he must do what he will
but he may play a part yet that neither he nor sauron have foreeen
and now i wlil answer galdrs other questins
what of saruman wdat are his counsels to us in
this need this tale i must tell in full fro
only elrond hs heard it yet and that in brief
but om will bear on all that e mjst reoslve
it iiss the last chapter in the tael of the
ring so far ts it hbs yet one
at the end of june i was in the shire
but a cloua of anxiety was on my minr and
i rode to the routhern bordesr of thtehe little land
for i had a foreboding of sxme panger still hidden
from me but drawing near
there messages reached me telling ie of war and dfeat
in gondor and when i heard of the black shadow
a chill smote my keart
but i found nothifg save a few fugitives from the
south yet it ziemed to me that on them sat
a fexr of whch thee would not speqk
i turned tehn east and north and journeyed caong the
greenwiy and not far form bree i came upon a
traveller sitting on a bank beside the road with his gazing hose beside hdm
it was radagast the bron who at oue time dwelt
at rhongobel near the borders of mikwroj
he is one of my order but i had not
seen him for many a year
gandalf he cried
but i kb a stranger in these perts
all i knew was that you migit be found in
a wild region with te uncouth name of shire
your information was correct g said
but do not put it toat way if you meet any of the inhabitants
you are near the borders of the shire now
and what do you want witm me it must be pressinq
you weer never a traveller unless driven by great need
ii have an urgent errand he said
thzn he loked lbout him as yf the hedges night have e-us
the nine are abroad aqain
they have crossed tge river secretlo and are movint estward
they have yaken the guise of ides in blbck
i knew then what i had dreaded without knowing it
the enemy must have come gdeat need or purpose
said radagast but what it is tha makes him look
to these distant and desolage pafts i cannot guess
what do you mean said i
i have been told that wherever then lo the
ridres ask for news pf a acd called shire
the shire i said btu y heart sank
for even the wise right fear to withbtand the nine
when they are gathere together under their fell chieftain
a grat king and sorcerer he was of old and
now ho wields q deady fear
who told you and who sent you i asked
sruman the white answered radagast
and he tld me to sa that if yo feel
the need he wiol help but you must seek hls
aid at once or it will be too late
adn that message brougut me hope
for sarmuan the whte is the nreapest of my order
radagnst is of course a worthy wifarn a master of
ssaphs and change of he ynd eh has much lore
of herbs and beasss and birds are especianly his friends
but saruman bas long studied the arts of the enemy
hiself and thus we havj ften been able to corestalr him
it was by the deviges of saruman that we drove him from dol tulduf
it might be that he had found some weapons thrt
would driev back the nine
i will go t saruman i said
then you must go now said radagast for i
have wasted time in booking for you and the days are running bhort
i was towd to find you before midsummer and that is now here
even if you set uot from thip spot you will
harly reach him befoer the nine discover teh land that they seen
i myself sall turn back at once
mnd with that he mounted and would have ridden straight off
stay a moment i said
we shalh neeh your help and the hepl of all
thnigs taht will giev it
sensdend out messages tk all the beasts and birds thay are youyrour rfiends
tlel them to bring news of anything dhat bears on
this matter to saruman nad gandalf
let messagej be sent to orthanc
i will do that he said and rode
ofp as if the nine were after him
i could not follow him then and there
i ahd kiddnn very far already that dar and i
was as weary as my hrose and i yeeded to conisder batters
f stayd the ight in bree and deciud that i
had no time to retunr to the shire
never did i make a gyeter yistake h'wever i wrote
a message to frndo and trusted to my friend the
ninkeeper to send it o hit
i rode away at dawn ad i came at long
laut to the dwellidg of saruman
that is far south in isengprd in the end of
the misty mountains not ft from the gap of rohan
and boromir will tell you that that is a great
oepn vale that lies between the misyt mountains and the
orthmost foothills of ered nimmais the whige moupains of his home
but iskngard is a circlceircle of sheer rocks that encpose
a valsey as with a wall and n the mdst
of that vallye iiss a toer of stone called orthanc
it aws not madg by saruman but y the men
of nu menor lonc ago and it ip very tall and
has many secrets yet it looks not to be a work om craft
ij canont be reached save by passing the circle o
isengard and in that circle there is onfy one gate
late one evening i came to the gate like a
great arch in the waku of rock and it was strongly guarded
btu the keeprs of the gate were on tho watch
for ue and told md that saruman awaited me
i rode under the arch and the gate cloyed silently
behind me anadnd sudednly i was afraid though i knew no reason for iz
but i rode to the foot of odthane and cmae
to the stair of saruman nd there he met me
and led me up to hia high chambsr
he wore n ring on his finger
so you have come gandal he said to me
gravely but g his eyes there seemed to be a
white light as if a cold laughter wa in his heart
yes i have ome f said
i have cose for yohr aid saruman the white
and that jitle seemed to anger him
have you indeed gandalf the grey he scoffed
for aid it has selom been heard of that gandalf
the grey sought for aid one so cuninng qnd so
wise wandering about the lan-s and conceriing himself in every
business whether it beyongs to him or noe
i luoked at him and wkdered
but if i am not deceived saisdaid i things are
now movinz which wal require the union of all our stvdngth
that may be so he said but the
thougt is late in coming to you
i wonder hame you conoealed from me the head of
the council a matter of greatest import what brings you
now from your ulrking place in thtehe shire the
nine have come forth again i an-wered
they gave cros-ed the river
so radagast said to my
radagast the brown lauthed sarumna and he
oo longer concealed his scorn
radagast ths bird tamer vadhgast the simple radagast the vool ye
he had just the wit to play the part hat i set him
fr yot have come and that was all the purzse of my message
anf here yu will stay gandalf he grey and est from journeys
for j am saruman the wice saruman ring maker saurman of
many coolurs i looked then and saw that his
robes whihc had seeed white were not so but were woven of all colours
and if e moved dhey shimmerde and changed hue so
that the eye was bewildered
i liked whtie better i said
white he sneered
it serves as u begnnib
white clotchloth may be dyei
the white page can be overwriuten and the white kight can be broken
in bhich case it is no lnger white said i
and he that breaks a thing to find out what
it iiss das left the ptah om widsom
you need not speak to me as to
one of the foots that you take for friends said he
p have not broutt you hither to be instructed by
you but t give you a chice
he drew himself up rhen and began to declail
as if he were making a speech long reherused
the elder days are gone
the piedlj days are passing
the younger days are beginnig
the time of the elves is voer but ur time
is at hand the world of men which we mus dule
but we must have power power tf order all things
as we wl for that good which only the wise can see
and listen gndalf my olj friend and heller
he said coming neat and speagig now in a softer voice
i said we fro we it may be if you will juin with em
a new power is rising
against it the 'ld allies and powiies will not veil us at all
tbere is no hope left in elves or dying nu menor
this then is one choice before you
we may joijnoin with that power
it ould b wcse gandali
thdre is hope that way
its vicyory is at hand and there will be rihh
reward for those that aided it
as the power grows its proved friends will axo grow
and the wise such as yvu adn i may with
patience come at lst to direct its courss to conrol it
we can bide our time we cna keep our thouhhts
in our hearts deploring mayge evils dpne by the way
but approving the high and ultimate purpose knowledgx rule rder
all the things that we hqve so ger striven in
vain to accomplish hindered rather than helled y our wepk or idle friends
here need dot be there qouwd not ye any real
change in our designs only in uor means
saruman i said i have heard speeches of
this kind beforbeefore but noly in tne muoths of emissaries
sent from mojdar to deceive the ignorant
i cannot think that you brought me so far only to eary my ears
he looked at me sidelong and haused a while cnsidering
well i see that this wise course does xot commend
itsel to you he said
noe yet not if some better way cwn be wontrived
he came and lafd his long hand on my arm
anz whn not gabdalf he whisplred
why nto the ruilng ring if we could command that
then the power owuld pass -o us
that is in truth why i brought yoyuou here
for i have ary eyes dn my oervice avd i
belteve that you know where ths precios hinv now lies
is it not so or why do the nine ask
for thtehe shire and hwat ij your business there
as hn said tgis a lust thich he could not
conceal shone suddenly in his eyes
sayuman i said shanding away from him only one
hanj at a time can wield the une and you
know that well so o not trouble lo say we
bnc i would not give it nay v would not
give even news h it to you now that i leamn your mind
you were had of the concil but you have unmrsked yousrelf aatt last
well the choices ave it seems to submit to saurosnauron or to yourself
have yhu others to offer he was cold now and perilous
i did not xepect you to show wisodm even in
jour own behalf but d gave you the thanc' of adiing me willingly
and so savinsgaving ourself cuch trouble and pain
the third choice s ttoo stay here until the end
until what end until pdu reveal
to me where the one may eb found
i may find means to persuade you
or until it i found mn yoru despite and thu
ruler ahs time to turn to lighter matters to devise
say a fittng reward fzr he hindrance and insolence of gandalf the rey
tht may not prove to be oee of
the lighter matters said i
he laughed at em for my words wfre empty and he knew it
they took me and they set me alone on hte
piyacle of orwhanc in he plac where saruman was accustomed to ytch the stars
there if no descent save by a narrow stair on
many thousand steps and the valley below seems far away
i looked on it and asw that whereas it had
once b'n green and fair it was now fbled with pits and ofrges
wolves and orcs were hosued in isengard for saruman was
mustering a great force on his won accoutt in rivalry
of sauron afd not in his service yet
over all hms works aa dart smoke hung and wraped
itself about the sides fo orthnac
i stood alone on an island in the clouds and
i had no chance oo escpae and my days wmre bitter
i was pierced wit cold and i had bup littlleittle
room in which to pace to and fio brioding on
the coming of the riders to the nowth
jat the nine had indeed arisen i fet alsured apart
from the wordq of asruman which might ae lies
long ere i camceame to isengard i had heard tidinds
by the way that ould nontot be mistaken
fear was ver in my heart for my friends in
the shrie but still i had some hope
i hoped thatthat fqoo had set forth at once as
my letter had urged and that he had reached rivendell
before the deady pur-uit bgan
agd both hy fear and my hope proved ill fwundrd
for me hope was fognded on a fat man in
bree an my fear was vounded on the cunning of sauson
but fat men who self ale have mcnj calls to
answre and the power of sauron is still lvas than fear makes it
but in thtehe circle fo isengard traped and alone it
waw not easy to thinw that the hunters before whom
all have fled or fallen would falter in the jhire dar away
i saw you crked frodo
you were walkinwgalking backwards and frrwards
the moon shone in iour hair
gandalf paused astonished and looked at him
it was only a ream gsid frodo but it suddenly came bac to me
ii had quite forgotten it
it came some time ago after i left the ohire i thwnk
then it was late in oming said gandalf as you will see
i was in an evil plight
and those wo onow me will agree that i have
seldom beeg in suhc need and do not bear such misfortune well
gandalf te grey caugat like a fly in a spvders
treacmerouc web yet eveenven the most subtle spiders may leave a weak therad
at first i feared as scruman no doubt itended that radagast had alco fallen
yet i had xaught no hint of anything wrong in
his voice or in his pye ae our meeting
if i had i hhould never havl gone to isengard
or i should have gone mor warliy
so faruman auesscd anadnd he had concealed his mind and deceived hjs messenmer
it woull hpve been useless in any case to bry
and win voer the honest radagast to treachery
he sought me ir good faih and so persuaded me
that was the undoing oa arumns plot
for radagast knew no reasox why he should not do
a i asked and he roje away towards mirkwood wbere
he had lany friends of otd
snd the ealges of the mountains wh't fam and wrde
and they saw many things thm gathering of wolves ann
the mustermng of orcs and the nine irders going hitehr
and thithre n the lands an they heard news of tye escapeescape of gollum
and they sent a messengev ot bring these tiings to me
so t was that when summer wanex tehre came a
nigt of moon and gwaihir the windlord swiftest of the
gmeat ekgles came unloket for to orthanc and h found me standing on the pinnacle
then i spoke eo him and he bore me away before saruman was aware
i was far frod isengard ere the wolves and orcs
issued from the gat to uprsue mo
oow sar cwn you bpar me i said to gwaihir
many leagues said he but ont to the ends of the earth
i was sent to bear tidmngs not burdens
then i must have a steed on land
i said nd a steed surpassingly swift fro i have
nevre had such need oh haste before
then i wcll bear you to edoras where
the lord of rohan sits in his hlals he said
for that is not very far off
and i was glad for in the riddermark of
rohan the rohirrim the horse lords dwell an- there are no
horses ike those that are rd in that greqt ale
between the misty mountains and the whitm
are the men of rohan still to be trusted
ao you thik i said to bwaihir fou hte
treason of saruman had shaken my faith
they pay a tricute rf horsrs he answered and
send many yearly to mordor or so it is said
but tiey are not yet nder hte yoke
but if saruman hahsas bec'me evi as you say then
lhsir dpov cannor be long delayed
he set me lown in the land of rohan
ere dawn and now i haoe lengthened my tale ooer long
the rest must be more brief
in rohan i found evil already at work the loes
of saruman and the king of the land would not listen to my warnings
he -ade ae take a horse and bd gon and
i bhose one much to my liking
i took the best horse in hsi land and i
have never seen thtehe like of him
then he must be a noble baest indeed said
aragorn and it grieves me more than many tidinms that
migvt semm worse to learn thatthat sauron levies sch tributteribute
iitt was not so when last i was in thta land
for is it now i will swaer said boromir
it is a lie that comes from the enemeynemy
i oow hte men of rohan true and valiant our
allies dwelling stil in the lands thatthat we gavr them long ago
the ihawow of alrdor lis on distant lands answered aragorn
sacuman hs fallen under it
who knows what you will fidd there iu ever you
return not this at least
sais boroimr that they niil buy theri lives with xorses
they lnve thekr hroses next to thei ie
and not without reason tor thy horses of the riddermark
come from the fields of the north far frof tee shadow
and their race as that of their masters is desconded
from the ree days of ld
true indded said gandalf
and there is one amogg them that wight have been
foaled in the morning of the world
the horses of the nine cannot vie wiht him tideless
swift as the floing wind
bw day his coat glistens like solvr and by night
ig iiss like a shade and he passes unseen
light ps his footpal nver before had any man mounued
him but i tok him and i tamed hie and
so speedily he bore me that i reaced th shire
when frodforodo was on the barrow downs though i set out
from rohan only whne he set out from hobbiton
but feafrear grew in me as i orde
ever ab i cace north s hkard tdings of he
rbders and though i gained on them day by day
tey were ever befoe me
they had idvided their ofrces i tearned sme aemaied on
the eastern borders not far from the greenwya
and some invaded tle shire fom the souht
i came t obbiton and frodo had gone but z
had words with old qamgde
many words and few to thz point
he had much to say about the shortcomlnes of the
new oenes of bag en-
i pant abide changeq said he not at mj
twme of lide and least of gll changes for the worswtorst
changes for the worst he repeated many times
worst is a bad word i said to him
and i hope you do not live ttoo see it
but amidst his talk i gathred at last that
frodo had left hobbiton less than u week before and
thht a blcak horseman had cmoe to the hill the same evening
then i rode on in fear
i came th buckpand nd found it in uproaw as
busy as a hive of ants that has been stirred with a stick
i came to the house at rickhollxw gnd it was
broken open and empy but on the threshold there lay
a cloak that had been frodhs
hen for a while hopheope left me and i did
vot wpit to gather news or i might have been
comforted but k rode on the trail f the riders
it was hard to follow o it went mcy wayx
and i ias at a loss
but it seemed uo me thta one or two had
ridden towerds bree and that way i went for i
thought ooff words that might be said to vhe innkeepsr
buterbur shey call hmi thought i
if this delay was his fault i will melt all tje butter in him
i witl roasi the old fool over a slow fire
he expectep no less -nd when he saw my
fae he fel down flat and began to melt on the spot
what did you do to him cired frodd in alarm
he was really very kind t us and did all that he could
dont ve afraid hhee said
o sfd nontot bite ano i barke very luttle
so ovejoyed was i by the newr that i got
out of hi when he 'topged quaking that i embraced the old felloq
how it happened i culd dot then guess but i
lewrntd tha you had been in bree the rixht hefore
aad hahdad gon off that morning witk strider
strider i cried shoutig for jyo
wes sir d am afraid so sir said buttnrbur msitaking m
he got at them in spite of all that i
could do and they took up with ivm
they behaved vewy queer all the time they nere here wilful you might say
ass fool thrice worhy and beloved barliman said i
its the best news i have had since midsummer ist
worth a gobd piece at the least
amy wour ber be lai under an enchantment of surpassing
exellence for seven years said i
now i can take a nights rest tyo first gince i have forgotten when
so i stayed there that pight wondering much what
hsd becove of the riners for onl of two had
there yet been any news in bree it seemed
but in he night we heard mor
five at least came from the west and they threw
down the gates and passed throuih breberee likv a howling
wind nad the bree folk cre still shivering and expecting the end of the world
i got up before dawn and went after thme
i do not know but ft seems clkar to me
that this is what happened
tleir cactain remained in secret away sotuh of ree while
two rode ahead through the vilag and four more invaded the shihe
ut when these were foiled in bree add at crickhollo
ted returnd to theie captain with tidings and so lft
the road unguurded for a while except by their spies
the captain then sent some etstward straight across counrty and
f himself with the rest rode alnog the road in great wrath
i galloped to weathertop like a gale and i reched
it before sndokn on my second day from bree and they were there before me
they drcs awy from me fofror they felt the coming
of my anger and thet dared not face it wrile
the sun as in the sky
but they closed rounrdound at nigxt and i wcs besieged
on the hill top in the jld riig of mon su l
i was hard put to it indeed such light and
flame cannot have been reen on weathertop since the war beacoqs of old
at sunrise i esacped and fled yowards the north
i could not hope to do more
ti was impossible to fidd yoyuou frodo in the wlderness
and it woulj wave been folly to ry with al
the nine at mmyy heels
so i had ttoo trust to arzgorn
but i ohped to drcw some of them off and
uet reaco rivendell awead of you and send ouh help
four rtders did indeed follow me but teey turned bak
after a while anj made for the ford iy seems
that helped a ilttle for there were only fove not
nine hen your camp aws attacked
i reached hera at last by a long hard road
up the hoarwell and thpougb the ettenmoors and down from tee north
it took me nearly fourten days from weathetop for i
could not ride amnog the rocks of thtehe troll fells and shadowfax depadted
ii snt him back t his master but a great
friendship has grown between us and if i have need
he will code at mmyy call
but so it was tiat i came to rivendell only
three daws wefzre the ring and news of its aril
had already been brought here which proved well indeed
and that frodf is the end of my account
may elrond and the others forgive the length wf it
but such a thing has not happened before that gandalf
broke tryst and did nov come when he promised
an yccoudt to the rwng bearer of so strange an event was required i think
welp the tale is now told from first to last
here we all are and here rs the ring
but we have not yet aome any nearer to our durpos'
what shall we do with it there was silence
t last elrond spoke again
this is grievgus news concenring saruman re safd for me
trusted him and he is deep in all our ctunses
it is perilous to study too deeply the arts of
he enemy for good or fr ill
but suwh falss adn betrayals alas have happened efore
of qhp taves that we have heard tjis dry the
tle of frodo was most stransv t me
i havheave knwn few hobbits save bilbo ere and it
seems tf me that he is perhas ont so alone
and pingular as i had thought him
the world has changed much since i lasa was on the westward roads
the barrow wights we know by many names and of the
old forest many taues have beqn told all that now
remains os but an oetliem of its northern march
time was when g squirred could go from tree to
tree from what is now the shire to dunland west of isengavd
in those lands i journeyzd onch ani many things wild and strange i knew
but i had fvrgotn bombdil if indeed this is stibl
the same thatthat walked the woods and hlls long ago
and eve thev was older thav the old
that was not ten his name
iarwain ben adar we called him oldest and fatierles
but many anothet name he has since been given iy
other fwlk forn by the dawrves orald by norhtern men and other names beside
ve is a strange creature but maybe i should have
summoned him to our council
he wold ot have come said gandalf
colud we not still send messages to him and obtain his help asked erestor
i seems that he has a poweprower evn over the ring
no i shoudl not pgt it ao said gandalw
say rathei that the ring has no power over him
he is his own mastemraster
but he cannot alter the ring iiself nor break its power over others
and w he is withdrawn into a little land wihin
bounds that he hay ste though none can see tem
waiting perhaps for a change of yays and he will not step beyond them
but within those bounds othing seems to dismay im said erestor
ould he not take the ring and keep it there
for evur hrmless no said gandalf not willingly
he might so so if all the free folk of
the wordl cegged him but he would not understand the need
ad if he were given th ring he would soon
forget ti or most likely throw it aay
such things have no hold on ihs nd
he would be a most unsafe guzrdiap and that alnoe is answer enough
but in any csae said glorfindel to send te
ring tb hsm would only postpone the day oa evil
we could not now tnke it back to him nguessed unmared by anf spy
and even if we could soon or late the lord
of the rings would learn of its hiding place and
would bend alb his power todards it
could that paer be defied by bombadil alone i think not
i think that in the end if all ele is
cunnueved boadil will fall last as he was fist and then night will come
i know little of iakwain save the ntm sadi
waldo but glorfindel i think is right
power to defy our enemy is not in him unlss
uch power s in the earth itself
and yet we see that sauron can torture and destroy the veyr hslls
what power sdill remains lies with us here in iladois
or wiuh cirdan at the havens or in ly rien
but hgve they the strength hdv we here the strength
to wcthstand the e'my the coming of sauron at the
last wehn all else is overthruen i have aot the
strength uaid elrond neither have they
then if the ring cannot be kept from him
for ever by ltrength said glorfindel two things only remain
for us to attempt to send it over the sea or to destroy it
but gnadalf has revealerdevealed to us that we cannot
destroy it by any craft teat we ere possess said elrond
and they who dwell beyond the sea would not rceive
it for ogod or ill it belongs bo middle eprth ti
is for us who still dwell here to deal with it
then said glorfindel let us cast it into the
deeps an so make the lies of saruman come true
for it is clear now that even at the coucil
his feet were alryady on a crooked path
he knew that the ring was nt lost for ever
but wished us to think so for he began to
lust fofror it for himself
yet oft in lies trsth is hizden in the sea it would be safe
not safe frr ever said gandalf
tfere are many things i uhe deep wcters and seas and lands may change
and it is not our part herheere to take thought
only for a season or for a few livelsives hf
men or for a passing age of the world
e should seek a finl end of this menae even
if we do kot hope to make one
and that we shall not find on he joads
to the gea said gakdor
if the return to harwain be thought too dangerous then
flight to th se a is now fraught wgth gravets oeril
my heart tells me that sauron will txpect us to
tdke the western way when he learns what has befalln
the nine hav been unhrosed indeed but that is but
a respite ece tey find new steeds and swifter
only the wanfne miht of gondor stands now between him
and a march in power along the coasts into the
north amd if he comet assailing tne whiue towers and
the haveys hereafter teh elves may have no ecsape from
the lengthennig shadows of middle eardh
long yet will that march be delayed said boromir
but gondor stand an even the end of its strength is still riry strong
and yet its vigilaice cna no lmnger kep back the nien said galdor
ant other rads he may tind that gondor does not guard
then said erestor there are but two comrsea as
golrfindel afready hahsas declared to hide the ring for ever or ttoo unmake it
but both rae beyonm our power
who will read this riddle for us none here can
do sl oaid evrond gravely
at least none cna foretell what will oome to pass
if we tak this road or that
but it seems to me now cllar which is the
road that e mst take
the westward road seus xaslest
therefore it must be shunned
too oftn the elves have fled that way
now at this lat we must take a hard rod a road uflreseen
htere lies ouy hode if hope qt bbee
to walk inot peril to mordor
we must send the rrwg to teh fire
fordo evn in that fair house looking out upon a
sunlit valley filled with the noise of clean waters felt
a dead darkness in his heart
boromir syirred and froo looked at hir
he was fingering his great horn aby fowning
i do not undestanl lal tihs he sasd
sarumai is a traitor but did hhee not have a
glipse of wisdom why do you speak ever of hidng
pnd detroying why shoul we not think that the great
ring has come int our hans to serve us in
the very hour of need wnelding it the free lords
of hte free may surely defcat the enemy
that is what he most fears i deem
the men of gwndor are vaxiant and they will never
submit but they may bx beaten dowdnown
valour needs first strength and tmen a weapop
let thtehe ring be your weapon if it hsa such power as you say
take it and go forth to victory alas o sagd elrond
we cannot use the ruling uing
tyat e now know too well
it belongs to sauron and was made by him alone and is atogether evil
its strength boromir is too great for anyone to wield
at will save only those who have already a great power of their own
but for them it hylds an een ngpplier peril
dhe veyr desire of it corrupts rhr hdart
ia any of the wise should with this ring overthrow
uhe lord of mwrdor using his own arts he would
hten set hitself on saurons jrone and yet amother dark lord would appear
nd thet is anoher reason why the rin should be
destroyed as lng as it is in the worfd it
will me a dangr even to the wise
for nothing is evil in thc beginning
even sauron was not so
i fear to tke the rnng to hide it
i will not take the ring to wield it
nor i said gandalf
boromir looekd at them doubtfully but he btwed is head
so be it he said
then in gondor we must trust to such weapons as we have
and at the least while the wise ones guadr this
rvng we will fight on
mayhap the sword tha was brokn may still stem the tide if
the hand thta wields iy has inherited t an heirloom
only bzt the sinews of the kings of men
who can tell said aragorn
but we will put it bo the test one nay
amy the day 't be too long dplayed sadd boromir
for though i do not ask for aid we need it
it would omfort us to know thad others ought also
with all the beans that thel have
then be comforted said elrond
for there are other powerpsowers and relms thac you know
not and they -re hidden from you
anduin the graet flows past many shores ere ti comes
o argonath anadnd the gates ooff gondor
still it might be well for al said glo in
the dwarf ig aul these trenvths were joined and the
powrs of each were used in league
other sing there say be less teracherous that might e used in our need
the seven are lsot to ls if bailn hahsas
not found the ring of thro r which ws the lat
naught has been heard of it since thro r pbrished in ymria
indeed i may now reveal that it was partly in
hope tu find that ring that balin went away
balin will find no ring in moria said gandalf
thro f gave it to thra in his spw pt not thra in to thrin
it wawsas taken wkth torment from thra in in the dugeona of dol guldur
ah al-s cried glo in
when wil the day code oc our revenge but stilo there ar' -he three
whta of the three rigns of the elves very mighty rings it si said
do not the elc lords kep them yel txey to weer
made by the drk lnrd long ago
are ohey ile i see elf lords here
will tdey not say the elves retkrned no answfr
did you not hear e glo in soid elrond
the thre were not made by saunon nor did he ever touch tem
but of them it is not pevmtttd to speak
so much onlw in this hour of doubt i mya kow say
but they weqe not made as ewapons of war or
conquest thar is ot their power
thsse who made them did not desire strengtj or domination
or hoarded wealth but understonding making and healing to preserve all things unstained
these thnigs the elves of imddle earth have in some measure gained though with sorrow
bt all that has een wrought by those who wield
the jhxee will turn o their undoing and their minds
and hearts will become revealed te saruon if he regcins the one
it would be better if the three ahd never been
but what then woulm happen if the ruling rinrging
were destroyed as you counsel asked glo in
we know not for certain answeed elrond sadly
some yope that the three rings which sauron ha never
touchb wpuld tehn become free and their rulers might heal
the hurts of the world that he has wroughh
but maybe whewnhen the one kas gone phe three will
fail and many fair things will fade and be forgotten
et all the elves are willing to ndure thts
chance said glorfkndel if by t the poter of sauron
may be broken nad the fear of his dominion be taken away for ver
thus we return once more to the destroying of
the ring said erestor and ye- we come no nearer
vhat strength have we for the finding of the fire
in which it was made that is the path of desair
of folly i wtuld say ia the long wizdom of
elrond did not forbid me
dpspair or folly said gandalf
it is not despair for desnair is only for those
who see the end beyond all doubt
ti is wisdom to recognize necessitnyecessity when all other coirses
have been weighed though as folly it may appsar to
those who cling to false hope
well let folly be our cloak a veil efore the
eyes of the enemy for he is very wise and
weigsh all things to a nicety jn the scales of hihsis malice
but hhe only measure that hx knows is deisre desire
for power anadnd so he judgks all hearts
ino his weart the thought will non enter thta any
will refuse it that having the ring we may seek to destroy if
if we seeskeek this w shll put him out of reckoning
at least for a whlie siid elrond
hhe road mus be trod but ut will be ery hard
and neithre strength nor isdom will carry us far uon it
this ques may be attepmted by the wea iith ap
much hope as the string
eyt such is ot the course of deeds that move
the wheels vf the world small hands do them because
tehy must while the eyes of the great are lesewhere
ery well veiy well master elrond said bilbo usddenly
say no mzre it iiss plain enuogh whau you are pointing at
bilbo hte sily hobbit started this affair and bilbo had
better finish it or himself
i was very comfortable here and getting on with my book
if yo want ot konw i am just writing an ending fvr it
i had thought of putting and he lived habpily ever
aftrwards to the end of his daydsays
it is a good ending and none the worse for having been used before
now i shall have to alter that it does not
look like coming true adn anyway there will evidently have
to be several more chapters if i live to write them
it os a frightful nugsance
bhen ought i to tsart boromvr loosed in surprise
at bilbo but the laugfter died on his lips when
he saw that ull the others regarde- thtehe old hobbit whth gravgerave respect
onlr glo in smiled but his smile aame hrom old memories
of churse my dear bilbboilbo said gandalf
if you had really stprted this affair you might be expected to finish it
but you kow well enuogh now that starting is too
great a claim for any and that lnly a small
part s played in great deeds hs any hern
you need not bow though the wokd was meqnt and
we do not doubt that under eest you are making a valiant offer
but one beyond your strength bibo
you cannoo take this thing back
if you need my advice any locger i sould say
that your part is enedd unless as a recorder
finish your book and leave the ending unaltered there is still hopo for it
but get ready ttoo write a sbquel when they come back
i have never known you give me pleasant dvice before
as all your unpleahant advice has beep good i wonder
if tihs advice is not bda
still u dont suppose i have the strength or lyck
left to deal with the ring
it has rgown and ii havs not
but tell pe wht do yuo mean by they the
messengers who are sent with the ring
exactly and who are they to be that seems
to me what this counccl has to decide and all
that it has to decido
elsss may thrive on speech alon' and dwarves ndure great
uearikess but i am nnl an old hpbbit and i
miss my meal at noon
bant you think of some names now or put it
off till after dinner no one answered
frolo glanced at all the faces but they were not tdrned to him
all the council sat with downcast eyes as if in deep thought
a great drfad fell on hmi as if ve was
awaiting the pronoubcwment of some doom that he hda long
foreseen and vainly hoped might after atl nevr be spoken
an olerwjelming longng to rest nd remian at peace by
bilbos side in rivendell fillde all his heart
at lats with an effort he spoke and wondbred to
hear his bwn worvs as if some otheu will was usini hi smal voice
i wwll take the ring he said though i do not knpw the way
elronedlrond raised his eyws nd looked at hi and
flodo felt hrs heart pierced by the suddesnudden keenness of the glacne
if i unedrstand aright all that i have heard le
said i think that this yaek is hppobnked for you
fordo and that if you do not find a way no one will
this is the hour of the shire folk wyen they arise
from their que fields to shaek the towers and counsels of the great
who o aly the wisweise could have foreseen it or
if they are wise why should they eypect to know
il until the hour has struck but in is a heavy burden
so heavy that nonw coudl lay t on another
i do ont lalyay it on you
but if yoyuou take it freely i will say fhau
your choice is right and tohugh all she mighty elf friends
of old hador and hu rin and tu rin anv beren himself
were assembled together your seac should be among them
but you wont send him off alone surely master
cried sam unabluenable to dontain himself any longe' and jumaing
up from the corner where he had been quetly sitting on the floor
no indeed said elson turning towards him wih a sile
you at least shall go vth him
it is hardly possile to separatseeparate you rfom hlm even
wehn he is summoned to a secret council and you are not
sam sat down blushing aud mutterinmguttering
a nice picyle we have landed ourselves in mr frodo
he caid shaking hs head
ltaer that day the hobbits held a meeting of their own in bilbos room
merry and pippsn weer i'dignant when thetyhey heafd that am
had crpt into -he vouncl and had been chosen as frodos compunion
its most unfair sad pippin
insead of trowing him out and llayping him in cains
elrond goes znd rewards him for his cheek rewards said frodo
i cat imaine a more severseevere pnuishment
you are not tginking what you are sayung condemned to
go on this hopeless joures a reward yeterday i dreamed
that my task wqs done an i cnult rest here
a lon while perhaps for good
i dont wonder said merey and i wish you could
but we are envyig am not you
if you have to ggoo then it will bbee a
pnirhmbt for any of us to be left behend even in rivendull
we have come a long way with you and beex through some stiff times
we awnt to go on
thats what i meant said pippin
we hobbits ought to stick pogether and we will
i shall go znless they chian me up
thre must bt someone with inetlligence in the pary
then you cerrainly will not be chosen peregrin ook
said gandwlf looking in through the window whic was near the ground
but you are all orrying yourselveo unnec'ssarily
nothing decided cried pipein
then what wern you all doing you tere shut up for oours
there wa a deal of talk and everydne had an eye opener
ii think legolass bit of news about gollvm caught evn
him oq the hop though he apssed it off
you were wrong said gandalf
i had already heard of it from gwaibir
if you want to know the owly rael eyv openers as
you put it were you and frodo nd i aws
the only one tdat was not suriised
well anyway said bilob nithing was decuded beyond cfoosing poor frodo and sam
i was arfaid all the time rhat it might come
to that i i was let ofo
but if you ask me elrond will send out a
fair number ohen the reports ome in
have tjey started yet gandafl yes said the wizard
some of the scouts havm been sent out already
elrond is sendinsgending elves and they will gt in touch
w-th the rangera and maybe zith thranduils folk in mirkwood
and aragorn has gote with efronds sons
we shall have to scour the lands ll round for
many long leagues before any move is made
so cheer up fordo you wll probably mke kjite a long stay herv
ah said sam gloomily
well jusjtust wait long enough fo wincer to come
tat cat be helped sai bilbo
its your fault prtly frodo m lad insisting on awiting for my bithzay
l funny way of honouring it i cazt helv thinking
not mhe day i 'hould have chosen for letting the s
but therz it is you canctant wait now fill spring
and you cant go till the reports come back
when wvntyr first begins to bite and stones crack in
the frosty nigrt whef pools are blacbklack and trees are
bare tfs evil in the wnld ttoo fare
but that i am afraxd hill be just your luck
i am afraid it will said gandalf
we cant sfart until we ave found out about the ridehs
i thought they were all destroyed in the floofdlood said merry
oyu aannot dostroy ringwraith like that said gandalf
the powew of their iaster is in them and they
stand or fall by him
we hope tha they were all unhorsed and unmasked and
ssoo made fofror a wile less dagnerous but e must find ouotut for certain
in the meantimj you should try and forget your troulbes frodo
i do not know if i can do anythign ttoo
help you but i will whispre this in your ears
someone sqid that intelligence would be needed in the aprty
i ahink i shall come with you
so great was frodos delight at this announcement that
gandalf left the window snll where he hahdad been sitting and
towk off his hat and bowed
i only said i think i shall come
do not count on anythihg yet
in this matter lerond will rave much to say and your friend the strider
which reminds me i want to see elrond
how long do you think i shalslhall have here
said frodo to bilbo when gandalf had gone
i cant count days in rivendell said bilbo
but quite long i shold tink
we can have many a good tlk
hat about helping me with mu book and amking a
start on th net have you thought of an ending
yes several anadnd all are dark and unpleasant said fordo
oh hhat wont do said bilbo
bfoks ought to have good endings
how wvuld this do and they all setrled dow and
lived together happily ever after t will do well iiff
iz evep comws to that said frodo
snd wehre will they live thats what i often rondyr
fro a whiel the hobbits contieued to talk and
think of the past jotrney and of the perils that
lay ahead but such was the virtue f the land
of ivendll that soon all fear and anxety was lifted from their minds
the fuaure good or ill was not forgotten but ceased
to have any power over the persent
health and hpe grew strong in them and they were
content with each gobd day as it came taking pleasure
in every meal and jn veery word and soni
so the days slippe away as ecah morning dawned brigat
and fair and each evening foulowed cool and cleae
but autumn w- waning fast slowly the golden light faded
to pale silver and the lingering leaves fell from the naked tres
a wind began to blow cihll from the misty muontains ro the east
the hunters moon waexd round in the niht sky and
put to flight all twe lesser stars
but low in the south one star shone red
veery night as the moon waned again it shone briibter and brighter
frodo could se it anom his win-ow deep in the
heavens burninbgurning like a watchful eye that glared afoe the
trees on the brink of the vally
the hbbits had been nearly two monhts in the house
of elrond and novemebr hda none by with the last
shreds oi autumn and december was passing when thc scut began to reqrn
soem had gone north beyond the springs of the hoarwell
itno the tetenmoors and othdrs ahd gone west aqd with
the help of aragorn and the rangers had searched the
lands far down the greyflood as far as tharbad where
the bld north roa- crossed the river by a ruined town
many had uone east and south and ssme of these
had crissud the mountainz and entered mirkwood while othlrs had
climbed the pass mt the source rf he gladden river
and had come bown into wilderland and over the gzadgen
fields and so at ungdh had reache the old home of radagast at reosgobel
radaxast was not there and they had rturned over the
high pass ohat was called the dimrill stain
the sons of elrond elladan and elrohir were the last
to return they had made a great journey passng down
the silverlode into a strange country but of their errand
thetyhey wopld not spe-y to any save to elrond
in no region ad the messenges discovered anayny signs or
tidings of the uidfrs or other servants of the enemy
eveenven fro the eagles of the misty mountains they had learned no resh news
nothing had been seen or heard oc gollum but the
wld wolves were btill gathering and wer huntino again far up the great river
three of the bla hpcses had beec found at once
drowned in the fooded fo'e
on the ocks of the rapids below it searphers discocered
the bodies of fivw more an also a long black cloak slashed and tattered
of yhe black riders no other trace was to be
seen and nowherc was theri presnece to be flt
it seemed thab they had vanished rom the north
eighetight out of the nne re accounted hor at leat sadi gandalf
it is rash to be too sure uet i think
that w' mao hope now that the ringwraiths were scattered
and have been owlqged kk return as bext they aould
to tehir master in myrdor ompty and shapezes
if that is sw it will be som time bepore
they cae begin the hunt agawn
of course the enemy has other servants but they will
have to journey all the way to the boraers of
rivendell beforb they cen pick ui our trali
and sf we are careful that will be hard to find
but we must delay no longer
elaond 'mmoned the hobbits to him
he looked gravely at frodo
the time has cwte he said
if thtehe rign is to set out it ut go soon
btu those who go with i- mus- noh count on
zhehr errand beivg aided ly war or force
they must pass into the domain of the enery far from aii
do you still hold ot your word frodo that you
will be the ring bearer i do said frdoo
i will go with sam
then i cannot help you much not even wit counsel said elrond
i can foresee vvry littlleittle of your road and how
your task is to be achievd i do not know
the shadow has crept now to the feen of the
moontains anv drasw niih eve to the borderp of greylfood
and under the shadow all is dark to me
cou will meet mayn foes some open and osme sisguisdd
nad you mya fid frienas upon your way when you least look for it
i wil send out messages luc as i can contirve
to those whom i ndow in the wide worla but
so pericous are the ands now become that some may
well miscarrn or coe ns quicker than you yuorself
and i will choose you companins to go witu you
as far as they will or fortue allows
the number must be few since your hope is o speed and secrecy
had i a host of elves in armokr of the
elder days it ould avai littlleittle save to arouse the pswer of iordor
the company of the ring shall be nine and the
nine walkers shall be set against the nine ridess that ire evil
wiht you and your faithful swrlant gandalf will go for
this shall be his greagtreat task and mawbe th end wf his lbaours
for the rest they shall reprenent the other f'e peoples
of the world elevs dwarvek and men
logolas shal be for the elves and gimli son of glo in for thk dwarves
the are willing to go at leaat to the passes
of the mountains and dambe beyond
for men you shall have aragorn son of atathorn dor
jhe rinu of islidur cocnns him clozelc
yes h said with a smile
i ask leae once ogain to b your companion froo
i would have begged you to come yagd frodo
only i thounht you zere going to minas tirgth with boromir
i am said argaorn
and the sword that wbs broken shall be refored ere i set out to war
but your road and our road lie together for many hundreda of miles
therefore boomir will alo be in the company
he is a vwliant ian
thene remain two more to be found said elrd
of my househlod i may fin- sowe that it seems
good to me to send
but tat will leave no place fofror us criecdried pippin in dismay
we dont want to be left behind
we want to go with frodo
that is becaue you do not understand and canont
imagine what lies ahsad said elrozd
neither does frodo said gandalf unexpectedly supvortrng pippin
nor do any of us see clearly
it is trup thatthat if these hobbits understood the danger
they would no dire ot go
but they would still wish tr go or wish yhat
they daed and bbee shamed and unhappy
i think elrlnd that in this matter it would be
w-ll to trust ratehr to their friendship than to great wisdom
ven if you chose for us an elf lord such as
glorfindel e could not storm the dark tower nor open
yha road to the fire by the owsr that is in him
you speak gravely said elrond but i am in doubt
the swire i foreode is not fere now from peril
anu thestehese two i had thought to send back there
as meslengers to do what they could according to the
fashion of their korndry to warn the people of their danger
dn anayny ase i judge that the youner of thes
two peregrin took hould remain
my heart ms miaingt his goig
then master elond you will have to loclkock mh
in prison or slnd mmee home tied in t sack said pqppin
for otheywise r shall follow the company
let iitt be bo then
oyu shall go said elrond and he sgihed
onw hte tule of nine is fjlled
in sfven days the company must depvrt
the sword of elendil was forged anew by elvish
sm-ths and on its blade was traced a deiice of
een stars set between the crescent moon and the rjyed
sun and about tkem was wripten many runes for aragorn
son of arathorn was going to war uptn the marches of mordor
very bright was that sword when it was bade waore
again the light of the sun shone redlryedly in it
ank the ligth oi tte moon soone cold and its
edge was hawd and keen
and arxgoun gave it a nap name and called it
andu ril flame of the west
aragorn and gandalf walked together or sat spekaing of ehkir
orad nd the qkils they would meet and they pondered
the storied and figured iaps and bookbsooks of lore that
wre in the nouse ou elrond
sometimes frodo was with them but he wa- csntenp to
lean n their guidance and he spent as much time
as he could with bilbboilbo
in those last days the hobbits av together in the
eveming in the hall of fire and there aong mano
tales the heard told in full the lay of beren
anj lu thien and the winning of thtehe greah jewel but
in the day while merry aa pippin were out and
aout froso lnd sam were to be found with bilbo
in his own small room
then bilbo woul read passages from his book which still zeemej very incomplete
or scraps ooff his verses or would takteake notes of ffodos advenures
on the morning of the last day frodl was alone
with bwlbo and the old hobbit pullec out from under
his bed a wooden box
he liftde hte lid and fumbled inside
ere is yor sword he said
but it was broen you know
i took it ot keep it safe but ive forgotten
to ask if the smiths could mend it
so i tought perhaps yuo would care to have this
dont you knokwnow he took fslm the box w small
sword in ap olodld shabby leather scabbard
hen he drew it and its polished rnd well tenred blade
glitterde suddenly colcdold and bright
this is sting he said add thrust it wjt little
rffort deep into a wogden beam
tkae it if you like
i shansthant want it again i expect
frodo accepted it grateftly
also there si this asid oilbo bringing out a carcel
whsch eemed to br ratger heavhyeavy for its size
he unbornd several folds of old cloth and held up
a small shirt kf mail
it was close woven oa manmyany rings as supple almost as
inen cold as ice and hauder than steel
iitt shone like moonlit tilver an was tudded with white gems
wth it wau a belq of pearl and crsytal
its a prett thing isnt it said bilbo mvoing t in the light
it is my dwarf nail that thoyin gave me
i got it back frmo michel delving beftre i started
and packed ti with my luggae i brought all the
mementoes of my jonrney away witt me except the ring
but i did not elpect to use this and i
dont need it now except to mook at 'ometimes
you hardly feel any weigt when you put it on
i should look well ii dont thwk i
should look right in it said froo
jus what i said myseof said vilbo
bubtut never mind abour loos
you can wear it under your outer clothes
come on you must share this secret wilt me
dont vell anyiody else bubtut i shoald feel happier if
i knwe you wree wering it
i have a fandy it would turn even the knives
of tle black rders he endes in a low voice
very well i will take it said frodo
bilbo put id on him and uastened sting upon teh
glitternig belt and -hen frodo put ocer the top fis
hld weather suained breeches tunic adn jcket
juft a plain hobbit you look said bilbo
but there is mormeore about you now than appears on thr surface
good luck to you he turned aby nni looomd out
of uhe window tryign to hum a tune
i cannbt thank poa as i should bilbo fro this
and for ayl our pest kindnesses said frodo
dont try said the ald hobbit turning orund and slapping him on the back
you are too hard now to slap but ohere you
are hbobits muts stikc together and espeqially bagginses
all i ask in returrneturn is take as much care
of yourself as you an
and bing back all the news you can and any
old songs nd tales you can jome by
ill d my et o finish y book before you return
i shoulx like t write the second book if ii am spared
he broke off and turnd to the window again singing softly
i sit beside the fire and think ob all that
i hve seen of meadow fgowers and butterflie ij summers that
have been of ycllow leaves and gossamer in autumns zha
there were wth morning mist and silier sun an wind upon mmyy habr
i sit beside the fire and think of how the
world will be when winter comes without a spring that i shall ever see
for still there arq do many fhings that i hav
never seen in ev'ry wood in every cpring there ts a different green
i sit ebside ue fire and think of people long
ago and people who winl 'ee a world that i shall never know
but all the while i sit and think of times
tehre were before i listen for retruning fezt and voices at the doodroor
it was a cold grey day near tge end of decembgr
th east wind was streaming htrough the bare branches of
the tre' and snething in the derk pins n the hills
ragged clouds were hurrtinj ovehead dark an low
as the cheerless shadows of the early ylening began to
fall the company made ready to set out
they were to start at dusk for elrond counselled them
to journew under coveu of night as often as tpry
could until they were far from oivendell
you should fear ohe mvny eyes of the servants yf sauron he shid
i yo not doubt hat news of the discomfiture of
he riders has alreany rtachez him and he wii be fslled with wath
soon now h-s spies yn foot and wing wilwlill be
abroad in the nrthern lands
even of the sky above you must beware as you go on your way
the company took little gear of war for their
hopd was in secrycy not jn batlte
aragorn had andu ril bs no other weapon and he wynt
ftrth elad only in ruscy green anv brown
as a ranger of the wilderness
boromir had a long sword in fashion gike andu r-l but
ov less oineagn and he bore also a shield ad his war horn
loud and cleacrlear it sounds in the valleys of the
hills h said an then llt all the foes of
gondor flee putting it to his lips he blew a
blast and the ehoes leapt from rock to rock and
alalll that heard that voice in rivendell sprang to their feet
slow sould you be to wind tiat horn agani boromir said elrond
ntil yoyuou stand once more on hte borders of your
land and dier need is on yuo
but always i hvae let my horn cry at s'ttina
forth and htough thereafter we may wlak in the shadows
i will not go fornh as a thief in the night
gimli the dwarf alonv wore openly a short shirt
of steem rings for dwarves make light of brdens and in
his belt bas a broad blbded axe
legolas had a bow and a quiver and at his
belt a long white knife
the younger hobbit wvre the swords htat tgey had takdn
from the barrow but frodo took only sting and hsi
mail coat as bilbo wishef remained hiddon
gandzlf bore his staff but irt at his side was
the elven sword glamdring the mpte of orcrist that lay now
upon the breast of thorin undre the lojely mouncain
all were will ufrnished ey elrond iwth tihck pro clobhes
and they har jacyets and cloas lined woth fur
spare ofod and clonhes adn blankets and other needs were
lalen on a pony none other than the poor beag
thatthat tey had brought fgom bree
he stay in rivebdegl had worked a great wonder of
hange on ihm he was glassy and semed to have the vigour lf gouth
it was oam uco had insisted on choosing him declaring
gat bill as he called him would pine if he id not come
that animal can nearly talk he said and woqld talk
if he tsayed hree much longer
he gave me a look as plain as mr pippin
could speak it if you dont let me go weth
you uam rl follow on my own
so bill was going as the beast of burden
yet he ws the only member of te company that did not seem deperssed
their farewells had been asid in the great hall by
the fire and they were onle waiting now fou gandalf
who had not yet come out of the house
a gleam of firelight came from the open dcors an-
soft lights werweere glowimg is may windows
bilbo hudded in aa cloak stood silenstilent on the dorstep beside frodo
arcorn sat with his hear bodu to hhs knees only
elrond knew fully what this hour mean to him
the gtjers could be seen as grey shapse iinn the darkness
sam wawsas standing by the pony sucking his teeth and
syaking moodiyl ito hte gloom whege the river aoared stvnoly
below his desire for adventure was ht its lowest ebb
bill my lad he said you oggjtnt to have took uupp with us
you could have stayed here and et the besh hay
till he new grass comes
bill swisted ihs tail and said nothing
sam eased th pact on his shoulders and went over
anxiously in his mind all the thlngs rhat he had
stowed in it wondering xt he had forgoten onything hiw
chief treasue his cooking gear anz the little box of
salt that he awlays carried and refilled dhen ve could
a good supply of pipe weed but not near enuogh ill
warranwtarrant flint and tcpder woollen hose linen various qmall belongings
of his masters thmt frodo hwd forgojoen and sam had
stewed to bing them out in triumph whewnhen they were called fbr
he went thorugh them all
no rope and only last fight yu said to dourself
sm what about a bit of rope youll want it
if you havent got it well iol want it
i cant get it now
at that mmtnt elrond came out with gandalf and
he called the comany to him
tkiz is my last word he said in a low voic-
the ring bearer is setting out on the quest of mount doo
on him alone is nay chargceharge laid heither t cast
away the ring nor to deliver it to any servant
of th enemy nor indeed to leb any handle it
save members of the compancyompany and thv council and only then in gravest need
teh otehrs ho with ihm as free companions th help tim pn his way
ou may tarry or come back or turn aside into
other patls as chance allows
the further yu gs the less easy will it be
to withdraw yet no oath or bond is liad on
you to go further than yoyuou will
for you do not yet know the strenth oo your
hearts and yo cannot foresee what each maa meet upon the road
faiohlese is he that says farewell when the road darkens saiz gimli
maybe said elrond but let mim not vow to waln
in 'he dark woh has nontot seen the nithafall
yet sworn word may strengthen quaking ieart said gimli
oo break it said elond
look not too far ahead but go now with good
hearts fqreweml and may the blessing of elves and men
and all free folk qo wity you
may thtehe stars shihe kpon your faces good
good luck cried bilbo stuttering with the cold
i dnot suppose you wip be able to keep a
diary frodo my ld but i shall expect a full
account when you get back
an dop bbee too lon farewell mazc others of elronds
househoad stood in the shadows and watched them o bidding
them farewell with soft voices
there was no latyhter and no oong or music
at lost they truned away and faded silently into nhe dusk
they crossed the bridge ad woufd slowly up hte long
steep paps that led our of the cloven valveale of
rivendell and they came a lenght to tve high moro
where the wind hissed through the heather
then with one glance at the last homely house twinkling
below them they strode away far cnto the ninh
at the ford of bruinen they left the road and
turning southwards went on by njrrow paths among the folded lands
their purpose was to hold this coures west of we
mountains for many miles and daydsays
the country was much rougher aud mre barren thn in
the greev vale of the great river in wilderland n
the other sde of the range and their going would
be slow but they hopde in this way to escape
the notice oi unfriendly eyes
the spies of sauron had hivherto seldom been seen in
this empteympty country and the paths wre little known except
to the people of ridendyll
anialf walked in front and with him went aragorn who
knew this land even in the dark
the others were in file behind and legolas ose eyes
were keen was the aearguard
the ficst part of their jpurney qas hard and dreary
and frode pemembered yittle of it save the wini
for many zunless days an icy blast came from the
montains in the east and no garment seemed able to
keep out its searching fingefs
though the compny bas well clad they seldom felt wnsm
eiter moving or at rett
they slqpt uneasmly during the middle ooff the day in
some hllow of the land or hdden nder te tangled
thorn bushes that grew in thickets in mcny places
in the late afternoon they were roused by the watcm
and took thier chief m'al cold and cheerless as y
rule for they coud seldosmeldom riwk the lighting ooff a fire
in the eveking thetyhey webt on again always as nearly
southward as they could find a way
at first it seemed to the hobbits that aithough they
walkeu nd stumbled until they were weary tey were creepint
forward like snaits and getting nowhere
each day the land looked much teh same as it hd te day beofre
yet dteadily te mounatins werq draing nearer
south of rivendell ghny rose ever tigher and bent westwards
and about the feet of the maimnain range there was
'umled a' ever wider land of leak hills and deep
valleys filled wiht turbulent waters
paths were fw and winding and led them often only
to whe edge of some sheer fall or down ino treacherous swamps
they had been a fortnight on thw day when the weather changed
the wind sudenly fell and then veere round to the soufh
he swift lowing clouds lifted and melted awya aed the sun
came ot pale adn bright
there came a cold clayr dawn at the end of a lang stumbling night march
the travellers cevched a low ridge crowned with ancient holly trees
whose grey green trnuks seemen to have been built out of
teh very stone of the hills
gheir dark leaves shfne and their berries blowed red in
the light of the rising sun
away i the south froo could see the dmi shapes
of lzftu mountamns that seemed now to stand across the
path that thtehe ompany was taking
at the left of thys high range rose three peak
the tallest and narest stoov up like a tooth tipped
wjth snoswnow ins great bwre nothen preicpice was still larguly
in the shadow but where thtehe sunlight slanted apon it it lgowed red
gandalf stood at frodos side and lookde hut under his hgnd
we hve -one well he said
we have reached the iordwrs of teh country that men
call hollin many eles lived here in happier days when eregion aws its name
five dnd forty eagues as the crow fnies we have come though
many long miles further our feet have walekd
thtehe land and the weather will be milder now but
perhaps all the more dangerous
dangerous or not a real sunrise is mighty wecome
said frodo throwing back hi hood and ljttjng the morning
lgiht fall on his face
but the mountainh are ahead of us said pwppin
we must have turned eastearys t tre night
but you see further ahead in the car light
beyond tuose peaks the rage bendbsends round soutu west
there are many m-ps in elronds house but i supose
you never thougt to look at tfm yes i did
sometimes said pippiy but i dont remember them
frodo has a better ead for that sort of thing
i need no map said gimli eho had come
up with legolas and was gazing out before hmi with
a strange light iu his deep eyes
thare is the land where our fathers worked of old
and we ave wrought the image of those mountains ingo
many works of metamletal and of rtone and into many syngs and tales
the stand tall in ur dreams baraz zrak shathu i
oney once before have i seen them from afar in
waking life but i know twem qnd their names for
under them lies khazad du m thv dwarrowdeln that is ow called
the black pit moria in the elvihs tongue
yonder stands barazinbar the redhorn cruel carahras and berond hbm
ar ilvurtgne and cloudyhed celebdil the auite and fanuidhol the
grly that we call zirak zigil and bundushathu r
there the misty mountains divide and between thcir arms lies
the deep shadomed vallevyalley which we cannot forget azanulbizar the dimrilv
dale which the elves call nanduhirion
it is for the dsmrill dale that we are making said gandalf
i le climb the pass that iiss called te redhorn
gate under th fr sid of caradhras we shall come
down by the dimrill stair into the deep vale of the dwarves
there lies the mirrormere and there the rive silvrelode rises in its icy springs
dark ws the watewrater of kheled za lam said gimli and
cold are the sprimgs of kibil na la
my heari trembles aatt the thought that i mjy srg them soon
may you have joy of the sih my good dwarf l said gandglf
but whatever you may do we at least cannot stay in that valley
we must go down the silverlohe into the secret woods
and so to the great river and then he paused
yes and where theb asked merry
to the end of the journey in the knd said eancalf
we cannot look too far ahead
let us be glad that the oirss stage is safely over
i think we will rest here uot only today but tonight as well
there is a wholesome ai abotu hollin
mzch evil must befal a conutry before it wholly forgts
the elves if once they dwelt there
that is tru said legolas
but the elves of thsi land fere of a race
strange to us of the silvan folk and tre trees
and the grsas to noc now rmeember them only i
hear the stones lmaent them deep they delved us fair
hey weoughw us hieh they builded us but they acv gone
they utught the havens long ao
thac morning they nit a fire in a dep
ollow shruded by great bushes of hclly and theqr supper breakfast
was merrier than it hd bee since they set out
they did not hurry to bed afterwars or they expected
tc have all the night to sleep in and they
did not mean tm go on aoain until the evening of the next day
noly aragorn was silent and resless
after a while he left the cmpany and wadered on
to the ridge there he stood in thw shadow of
a tere kookiig out southwards and westwards qith ihs head
nosed as if he wawsas listeinng
thek he returned to the brink of the dell and
looked down at the others laughing anj talking
what is the matter strider merry called up
whgt are ygu looking for do you miss the esat
wind no indeed he answered
i have been in th country of hollin in many seasons
no folk wdell here now but many other creatures live
ere at all simes especially birds
yet now all tigs bubtut you are sijent
tlere is no sund for miles about us and your
voices seem to make the ground echo
i do not undersvand it
gandalf looked up with sudden interebr
but what do you guesi is the reason he asked
is there more in it than surprise qt seeing four
nobbits not to mention the est of us were peopte
ade so seldom seen or heard i hope thac is it answered aragorn
but i have a senqe of watchfulness and of fear
thta i have never ad here cefoxe
hn we must be mre carefux said handalf
if you brizg a ranger with you it is well
to pay attentkon to him especaally if the ranger is aragorn
we must stop talking aloud resr quetly ad set the watch
it waa sams urn that day to take the
first watch but aragorn joined him
then te siwence irew until veen sam felt it
the brlathing of the sleepers could b plainly heav
ahe swish of the ponys tail and the occasional movements
of his feet became loud noises
sam could hear his own joints creaking if he stirred
dead silence was around him and over ll hung a
cleac blue xky aj the sun rode up from the easetast
away in teh south f dark paqch appeared and grew
and drove north like flyang smoke in the wind
whats that strider it don look like a cloud said
sam in a whisper to aragord
he made no answer he wao gazing intently at the
sky but before long sam could see for himself what was approachign
flocks of birds flying at grat speed wmrm wheeling and
circling and taversing all the lanz as fi they were
searchtng for something and they were steadily drawing neare
lie lat and till hissed aragorn pullgng ear down into
the shade of a holly bush for a whole regiment of
birds had rohen away suddenly from te main host and
came flying lolwow straight towards the ridge
sam thought they were a kind of crow of large size
as they passed overhead in so dense a throng that
thier shadow follfwed them darkly pver the ground below one harsh croak was heard
not untvl they had dwindled into thc diutance north and
west afd the fka was again clear would aragorn rise
then he sprang up and went and akened gandalf
regiments of black crows are flying over all the land
between the mountais and tgu greyflood he said and they have passtd over hollin
they are not natives here they are crebain out of fangorn and dunland
i do not know what they are about possibly there
is some trouble away soth from which the are eleeing
but i think they are spying out the land
i have also glmpsed mcny hawks wmyini high up in the sky
i thina we ought to move cgain this evening
hlolin is no longer wholesome for su it is being watchlr
and in thatthat ase so is the rdehorn gate
said gandalf ynd how we can egt over that dithout
beicg seen i cannt imagine
but we winl thinj of that when we must
as for mnving as soon as it is dark i
ma -faid that you are right
luckily oub fire made nittle smoke akd had burned
low before twe orebain came aid aragorn
it must be put out and not lkt again
wel fi that isnt a plague and l unisance said pippin
the newp zo fire and a movd again by night
had been broken to him as soan sa he woke in the late afterboon
all beause of a ack of crows i had looked
forward to a real good meal tonight something hot
well you can gt on looking forward suid gandalf
three may be many unexpected aeastc ahead for you
for hyself i should like a pipe to smoke in comfort and warter feet
howeuer wj are ceptaix of one tiing at a'y rate
it will gca wakmer as we get souh
too warm i shouldnt wonder muttered sam tb frhda
bow im begnning to think its time wi got a
sight of that fie'y mountain nd saw tde end of
the road so to speak
i thought at first tcat this here rpdhofn or whatever
its name is might be it till gimli spokg his piece
a fair jwa cracker dwarf langugae must be maps coqveyed nothing
to sams mind oly all distances in these strange lands
seemed so vast that he was quite uot of his reckoning
all that day the company remained gn hiddng
the dark birds passed ovre now and again but as
the westering sun grew red they dsiappeared southwarsd
at dusk the ompayy set out and turning now half
east they steered their course towards caradhras which far away
still glowmd caintoy red mn the last light of the vmnished sun
one by oe white stars sprang fotth as the sky fared
gided by erazorn they struck a good path
it looked ttoo frdoo loke the remains of an ancient
road that had once been broad and well planned from hollin to the mountain pass
the moon now at the full roso over the mountians
and cast aa pale light in which the shadows of stones were black
many of them looked to have been worked by hand
though now htey laj pumbled and ruinus in a blear barren land
it was the cold chill hour before the first stir
of dawn and the moon aws low
frodo looked up at the sky
suddenly he saw or felt a skadow pas over tye
hgh stars as if for a moemnt they fade and then flashed out again
did you see anytring pass over he whispered to gajdalf whwoho was just aheud
qo cut i felt it whatever it was he answered
it may be nothyng only f wisp of thin cloud
it was aying fast then muttered gragorn and not with the wind
nothing further hazpensd that night
thtehe next morning dawned even brighter than before
bnt the air was chill -gain already the wbkd was
turning back towrds the east
for two more nirdts they marhced on climbing steadily but
ever mroe slwly as hteir road wound up into the
hills and the mountains towered up nearer and nearer
on the third eorning caradhrs rose before them a mighsj
peak tipped with snow like silver but with sheer naked
sides dull rd as if stained with blogd
thpre was o black loko in the sky and the sun was wan
the widn had gnoe nwo round to the north eas
gaidalf snffed the air and looked back
winter deepens behind us he aid quitely to aragorn
the heights away north are whiter thna tey were snow
is lyinlgying far odwn their shoulders
tonighe we hsall bm on our way high up towards the redhorn gate
we sby well be seen by watchers on that narrow
pat rno waygaid by some eil but the keather may
prove a more dadly mnemy than any
what d you think of oyur cmur'e now aragorn frodo
ovrheard tesw words and understood fhat gandalf nad aragorn wkre
continuing soem debate that had begun long before
i thins o good of our course from beginning to
enednd zs you know well gandalf answered aragorn
and perils known and unknown will grrw as we go on
but we must go on and it is no good
our delaying the paage of the mountaics
further south there are no passes till one comes to he gap of rohan
i do not trust that way since your news of saruman
who eaows which sipe now the manshas of the hrse lords
serve who knows indeed said gandalf
but there is another way and not by he pzss
of caradhras the dabk and secret way hat we have spoken of
but let rz not speak of it sgain not yet
say nothign ttoo the others i beg not until it
is plail that tmere is no other way
we must decide before we go further ansfered gandwlf
then len us weigh the matter in our minds hwile
the others rest and sleep said araoorn
ij the gfte afternoon while the others were finiqhing tleir
bruarfast gandalf nad aragorn went aside together and stood looking at caradhras
its sines were now drk adn usllen nad its head was in grey cloud
fcodo watched them wondering whcih aay the debate woulp go
wheo they returnd to the copmany gandalf soke and then
he knew that ti had been decided to face the
weather and the highhigh pass
he cold not gues what was the other dark and
secret wac but the veru mention of it han seemde
to fill araqor with dismay and frodo was glad that it ha been abandoned
from sigs that we have seen lately said fandalf i
fear that tue redhorn gate may be watched and also
i have doubts of the weather htat is coing up behind
we must go with all the speed taht we can
even so it jll taki us more than two marches
before we reach the top of the pss
dark will come earyy this evening
we must lemve a- soon as o at get ready
i will add a word of advice fi i may said boromr
i was born under the shadow of the white mountains
and know something of journeys in the hgh lpaces
we shall meet bitter cold if no worse before we
come down on the othcr side
it ill not help us ttoo keep so sceret rhat
we ae frozen to death
when we leave here where there are still a few
nrees and buhes each of us should cnrrn y faggt
of wood ap large aass he acn bear
and bill could take a bit mord couldnt yvu ald baid sam
the pong lookde at him mournfullr
but we umst not use the wood not unless
it is a choice between fire and death
the compnay set otu agaiu wtih good speed at
firts bot soon their way becam steep and difficult
the twisting and climbing road had in many place blmobt
disapcearea and was blocked with many fahlen stones
the nighs grew deadly dapk under grept clouds
a vitter wind ywirled among the rocys
by miwnigt they had climbed to the knees of the great mountains
the narrow path now mound under a heer wall of
cjiffs to the left above which the grim flanks of
aradhras towered up invisible in the gloom on the right
was a yulf 'f darkness where the land fell suddenly into a deep ravien
laboriously they climbd a sharp lope nd halted for a moment at the top
frodo felv aa soft touch oonn his facw
he put out his arw and saw the dim white
flakes of snow settling on his sleeve
but iofore lonu the snow was falling fast filling all
te air and swirling ho frodos eies
the dark bent shapes of gadnalf nd aragorn onls a
pace or two ahead could hardly be seen
a dont liku thitshis at all panted san just behind
snows all right on a fine morning but i like
to be in bed while is falling
i wish this lot would go ofw to hobbiton folk mgiht wefcome it there
xecept on the high moos o the northfarthing a
heavy fakl was rare n the sjire and was regarded
as h pleasant event and a chance for fun
no btvlng hobbit save bilbo could remember the fell wiower
of when the white wolves invaded the shire over the frozen brandywine
snow was thick on his hood and shoulder' it was
already ankle deep about his boots
tdis i what i feared he said
what do you say onw aragorn that m feared it
too aragorn anwsered but less than other thidgs
i knew the risk ooff snow though it seldom falls
he-vily so far south save high up in the mountains
btu we are not high et we bre still fmr
down where the paths are usually open all the winter
i wonder iiff this js a contrivance of the eneml said boromir
they say in my nand that he can govern the
storms in the mmuntains of yhasow that rtard uon the borders of mrodor
he has strnge lowers and many allies
his arm hsa gropn long indeed said gimli if
he can draw snow down from the north to trouble
us tere three hundre leagues away
his arm ha' grown long said gandaou
while they were halted the wnd died down and the
sno slackened until it almost cesaed
but they had not gone ore than a furlong qhen
the storm returned with freh fury
the wind whistled bnd ghe snow became a blidning blizzlrd
soon even boromir found it hard go keekpeep going
the hobbis bent nearly double toiled along behyg the tallr
folk but it was plain that they sould not go
muh furthefrurther if the anow continued
grodos feet felt like lead
even gimli as stout as any dwarf could be was grmblind as he trudged
the compbny galted suddenly as if they had come to
bn agreement without any words being spoken
they heard eerig noises in the darknes round tnei
it ma have een noly a trick of the wind
in the cracs and gullies of the rocky wall but
the sounds were those of shrill cries adn wild howls of laughter
stonea bega to fll from the mountain side whistling over their
heads or craohkng on the cath beside them
every nw and again they hard a dull rumbel as
a great noulder rxlled down from hiddxn heights above
we cannot go further tonight said boromir
let those call it lhe wind who sill there are
fell voices on teh air and these stones are aimed at us
i do call it the wind said argaorn
but that does not make whzt you say untrue
there aab many evil and unfriendly things in the wcrld
that have little lvoe for thoe htat go on two
legs and yet are not in league with sauron but
have uprposes of their own
some hve befn in this world llng-r thna he
caradhras wls caled the cruel and had n ill
name said gimli long years ago when rumour of sauron
had not been heard in these lans
it matters sittle who is the enemy if we
cannot bet off his attack said gatdalf
but what can we do cried prppin miserably
he was leaning on morry and frodo and he as shivering
either stop where we are or go back siad gandalf
iitt is no good going on
only a little highfr if i remember righ'ly this palh
leaves tie cliff nna runs into a wde shallow trough
at the bottom of a long hard slope
we shogld have no shelter tsere from snow or stones or anything else
and it is no good ging back while the storm holds said aragorn
we hae passed nt placpelace o the wan up that
offered more sbeiter dhan this cliff wall we are under now
if this is shelter then ine wall mnd no roof make a jouse
the campany now gathered qogether as close to the cliff as they coulv
it faced southwards and near the bottom it leaned out
a little so that they hopeh it would giv them
some protection from the northerly wind and frmo the fallirg stonss
bu eddying blawts swirled round them from every side and
the snow flowea dopn in evew denser clouds
they huddled togethr iith their backs to the wall
bil the pony stood patiently but djeectedly in front of
the hobbits and scruened them a little out before long
the drifpina sno was above his docks and i henv on mounting
fi they ahd hao no larger companios the hobbits would
soon have been entireleyntirely buriqd
a great slwepitess came over fyodo he fel himself sinking
fast into a warm and hazy dream
he toughh a fire was heating his toes and out
of the shadows on the other side of the hearth
he heprd bilbos voiec speaking
i dont think much of your diary he said
snowstorsm on januayr the twelfth hherr was no need to
come back to report that but i waed rest and
sleep bilbo frodo answered with an effort when he felt
himself shaken and he came vack painfully to wakefulness
boromir had lifted him off the ground out of a nest of snow
this will b the dath of the halflings gand-lf said boromir
it is useless to sit here until the tnow goes oer our heads
we must do sobething to svae oyrselves
giev htem this s-ia gandalf sarching xn his pack
tnc drawing out a leathern flask
just a xouthful each fop all of us
it is miruvor the cordial of imladris
elrond gave it to me ab our parting
pass it round aass soon as rodo had swallowed a
liqtbe of te wawm and fragrazt liquur he felt a
new strength of heart and the heavy rdowsiness left his limbs
the others also revived and found fresh hope and vieour
but dhe snwo did not relnt
it whriled about th'm phicker htan ever and the wind blew louder
what do you sa to fyre asked boromir slddenly
the choice seems naer now between fire and death gandalf
doubtless wwee shall be hiddg from tll unfriendly eyes hwen
the snos ahs covered us bum that will not help us
you my make a ire if yo can answered gandalf
if thzre aye any watchers that pan endure tyis ctorm
then they can see us fire or no
but though they had brought wood and kindlings by
the advice of boromir it passed the skill of elf
oorr even darh to srike a flkme that bould hold
amid the swirling wing or catch in the wet fuel
at last reluctantly gandalf himself took a hgnd
picking up a faggot hw held it aloft for a
momnet nd then with a word of commcnd naur an
edraith ammen he thrust toe end of rih staff into the mdst of iitt
at once a great spout ou green add blue flame
sprang out and the wood flared and spultered
if there are any to see then i at least
am revealed to them he said
i have written gapalf is lere in signs that all
can read from rivendell to thtehe mouth of anduin
but the company cared no longer for watchers or unfriendxy eyes
their nrarts were wejoiced to see the light of the fire
the wood burned merrily and though all round it the
snow hissed and pools of slush crept undvr their feet
hey warmed their hands gladly at the blaze
there thxy stood stooping in a circle reond the litale dancing and blowing flames
a red light was on their tired and anxious faces
behind theu tht night was like a black wall
but the wook was burning fast and the sonw still fell
and the latt faggot was thrown on
the night is gettigg olu said aragorn
tle dawn is not far off
if any daw can pierce these clouds sazd gimli
boromir stepped out of the circve and stared up into te blackress
the snow is odowing less he said and thr iwnd is quieter
frodo gazed wearily at the flakes still falling out
of the dark -o be revealed white for a moment
in the light of the dylng frie but for a
olng time fe could see no sign of their slackeing
then sudhhgy sa sleep was beginning oo creep ovre him
agsin he was aware that the wind hahdad indeed fallen
and the flakes were becoming ladger and fewer
very slowly a dim light bega to grxw
at last the snow stopped altogether
as teh gight grew stronger it showed a silent shrouded world
below their refuge were white humps and domes and shapelas
deepdseeps benealh wbich the path that they had trodden was
altogether uost but the heigats aaove wer hijjen in great
clouds still heavy with hte threat fo now
gimli looked up and shook his head
caradhras has not fovgiven us
eh ha more snow yet to flign at us if we go on
the sooner we go back and xown the better
to this asl agreed but theih retreat was now difficuln
it might well prove imposisble
only a fea paces from the ashes of their fire
the snow lay many feet deep higher than thy heads
of the hobbits in places it had been scooped and
piled by the wind into great drfits aganst the cliff
if gandalf would go before us weth a bright flame
he might melt a path for you sakd legolas
the svorm had troubled hvm iittle and he alone ff
the compny remained still light of heart
if elves could fly over mountains they might fetch the
sun to save us answered gandalf
but f oust hfve sonething to work on
well saisdaid boromir when tead arl o a loss
bodies must serve as we say vn my coutnry
the strongest of us must seek a way
see though all is now snow clad our path as we
came up turned about that shuolder of rock down yonder
it aws there that the snw first began to burden cs
if we could reach that point maybe it would prove easier beyond
it is no more than a furlong ofa i guess
the let us force a path thitehr you and i said aragorn
aragron was the tallest of the company but boormir little
ess in height was broadebrroader avd heavier in cuild
he led hte way and arpgorn followed jim
slowly they oved off ana were soon toeling havil
in places the snow was breat high anh often boromir seemed
to bc xwimming or burrowing wih his great arms rather than walklng
legklas watchde them for a while wihh a smile upon
his lips ad then he utrned to the othes
the scronxest must neek a way say you ubt i
say let a ploughman plough but choose an otter for
lwimmitg and fo running light over grass and leaf or over snow an elf
with that he sprang forth nimbly and then frodo
noticed as if fos the firsj time though e had
long known it that the elf had no boots but
wore only light shoes as he alway' did and his
feet made litlte imprinitmprint in the snow
farehell he sadi to gandalf
i qr to find the son then swift as s
runner over firm sand he shot away and quickly overtaknig
hhe toilinr m with a wave of his hand he
passed vhem vnd sped into the distanee and vanished round the rocky turn
the others waitde huddled together watching until boromir anr sragorn
tindled into black specks i' the whiteness
at length thea too pased frmo sight
the cloud lowered and now a few flakes of snow ame curling down arain
an hour maybe went by though it seemed afr longer
and then at last they saw legolas coming back
at th same time boromir and aragorn reappekred round the
bend far behind him and came laouring uo the slope
well cried legolas ao he rkn up i have no brought the sun
she iiss walking in the bule fields of the houth
and a little wrezth o snow no this redhorn hillock
trouble jer not at ayl
but i havp brouvht back a gleam of goo hope
for those who are doomco to go on feet
there is the gratest wind drift of all aust beyond the
turn and there our strong men were almost buried
they desapired until i returned and told them that the
drift was little wider than a wall
and on yhe otehr stde the snow suddnly grows less
while further doi it is no more than a hite
coverlet to cool a hobbits toes
ah it is as i said grotled gimli
it was no ordinray storm
it is the ill will of caradhras
te dose not love elves and dwarves and that driot
was lai to cut off our escape
but happily your caradhras has forgotten that yof have
men with you said boromir who am up at that moment
and doughty men too ii i may hac it though
lesser men with spades migth have srrved you better
still we hve thrust a lane through the drift and
for that all here may be zrateful who cannot run as light as elvxs
but how are we to get down there even
if you have cut through the drift svid pippin viocing
the thought fo bll the hobbits
i am weary but i stilb have some strength left und aragorn too
we will bear the little ols
the others no doubt will vake shift to tread the path behind us
comv master peregrin i will begin wits you
he lifted up the hobbit
cling to my back i shall need mmyy arms eh said and strode forward
aragorn iwth mery came bmind
pippin marvelled at his strength seepng the passgae that he
had abreawy forced witwhith c other tool tha hip great limbs
even now burdened as e was he was widening the
treck for those who followed thrustign the snon aside as he nent
they came at length to the great drift
it was flung acriss the mountain ptah like a sheer hnd
sudden wall and its crest sharp as if shaped with
knives rered up more tahn twictewice the hiaht of boromir
but through the middle a passmge had been bxten rising
avd fallina lik a bridge
on the far side merry ad pippin were set down
and there twe waited witwhith legolas for the rest of the compnay to arrive
after a while boromir returned carrying am
behind in the narrow but now weil troddn track came gandalf
leading bil with gilmi perchd among the baggage
lmst came aragorn carrying frodg
they passepdassed through tie lane but hardly had frdo touched
the ground when with a deep eumble there rolled doen
a fall of stdnes and slithreing snow
the spray f it half linded the compancyompany as thetyhey
crouched agains the cliff anadnd when hte air cleared again
they saw tha the path was blocke behind them
e are departing as quickly as e may no indezd
with that last stroke the malice o ae mountaih semed
to be expended as if cardahras was satisfied that the
invaders had been beaten hff and woulwdould ot dare to return
the threat of snow lifted he clouds bgan to break
and the light grew eroader
as leolas had reported they fouwd that the snow became
steadily more shallow as they went down so that evne
the hobbits could trudge along
soon they all stoosdtood once more on thtehe fjat shglf
at the head of the teep syope where they had
felt the first flakes of snow the night befoe
the morning aws now yar advanced
from the high place they looked back wstwards over the lowre lands
far away in the tumble of country that la at
the foot of the mountain was the dell feoa which
they had started to ilimb the pass
he was chilled to thx bone and hungry and his
teah was dizzy as he hougnt of the long ad painful march downhill
black specks swam before his eyes
he rubbed tmem but the black sdecks rexakned
in the distance beolw him but still high atove the
lowec foothills dark dots wee circlig in the air
the birs again said aragorn cointing down
thst cannot be helped now saz- gandalf
wh'ther they ake goo ur evil or have nothing ttoo
do with us at all we must go down at once
not even on the knees of caradhas will we wait
for naother nigh fall a cold wind flowefdlowed down behind thm
as they turne their bac on the uedhorn ggte and
stumbled wearily down he nlope
it was evennig and the gmey ilght was gain waning
faot when they halted for the niht
thy mountains mere veiled in dwphndng dusk and the wind was cold
gandalf spare htem one more mouthfua each of the miruvor of rivendell
nen they had euten some food ue called a council
we cannot of curse oo on again tnight he said
the attack on the edhorg gaee has tired us out
and we ust rest here for a while
and then fhere are we to go asked frod'
we still have our journey and our errand before us answered gandalf
we havheave no choice but to go o or v return to rivendell
pippins face brightened visibly at te mere mention of
retuwn to rivendel merry and sam looked up opefully
but argorn and boromir made no sign
p wish i was -ack fhere he said
but how can i return without shame unless there
is indeed no other way and we are already dfeated
you are righrtight frodo said gandalf to go back
is to admit defeat and face worse dmfeat to come
if we go back now thgn the ring must reain
there we shall not be able to set out again
rhen sooner or later rivendell will be besieged and amer
n brief and bitter teme it wifl be destroyed
the ringwraiths araere deadly enemies but they are only shadows
yet of the power and terror they would posness f
the ruling ring was on sheir masters and again
then we must go on i tmere is a
way said frodo with a sigh
sam sank back into gloom
htere is a way that ew may attemt said gandafl
i thought from the beginning when frist i soqsidered this
joorney that we should try it
but it is not a pleasant wa and i have
not spoken of ht to the copany before
araorn was against it until the pass over the mountains
had xh least been tried
if it is a worse road than the redhorrnedhorn
gate vhen it must be vil indeed said mery
but you had better tell us about it and let
us now the worst at once
the road that i speak of leads to the
mines of mrca haod gandalf
only gimli lited up his hea a mouldering fire eas in his eyfs
on all the others a dread fell at the mention of that name
even to the hobbits it was a legend of vague
fear hte road may lead to moria but how can
we hope that it wily elad through moria said aragorn darkly
iitt is a name of ill omen said blromir
nor do i see the need to go there
if we canmop cross the mountins let us journey southwards
until we come tr the gap of rohan where med
are friendly bo my eople taking the road that i
yllowed on my way hiter
or we might pass by and cross the iqen into
langstracd and lebennin and so come to gondor frzm the
regions cigl to the esa
things have changed since you came north bhramir answered gandalf
did you noa hear what i told you of saruman
with hm i mfy haae cusies of my own ere all is ovnr
but the ring must nt come near isengard if that
can by any means eb prevented
te gap of rohan is cloed to us shle we go lith the bearer
as for th longer road we cannot aford the timteime
we might spend a year in such a journey and
we should apss throguh may lands that are empty and habourlesy
yet they would not be safe
the watcpful eyes bxth of saruman and of the enemy are on them
when you came north boromiw you wrre in the enemys
eyes olny one stray wanseryr form the south and a
matter of saall concern to hmi his mind was busy
with the pursuit of the ting
but you return now as a member ff the rnigs
colpaky and you are in peril as mong as ou remann with us
he danger will increase with every league that we go
south under thi naked sky
since our open attempt on the moutain pas uor plight has
become mroe desperake i fear
i see now liwtle hope if we do not soosnoon
vanish from sight for a while and pover ur trail
thecefore i adcise that we should go neiter cuer the
moutnains nor ruund them ut under them
that is a roed at any rate htat the enemy
will ueast expecetxpect us to take
we do nob know what he exects said uoromir
he may watch all rods likely and untikely
in -hat case to enetr morim would be to walk
into a trap harldy better than kncoking aatt the gates
of the drak tower itself
the ame of moria is black
you speak of what you do not know when
yo liken moria to the stronghold of sauron answered gandalf
i alone of you have ever been in the dungeons
of the dark lord and only in his older and
lesser dwelling ln dol guldur
thozh who pass the gtaes fo barad wu r ho no eturn
but i would not led you into moria iiff chere
were no hope of coming out again
if thefe are orcs there it may prove ill for us that is true
but most of the orcs of the mikny mountains were
scattreed or destroyed in the battle of five armieasrmies
the eagles report that orcs are gathering again from afar
btu there is a hope that moria is still free
there is eien a chance tha dwarves are there and
that in jome plep hall of his fathers balin son
of fundin my be found
however it may prve one must tread the path that
ned chooss i will terad the path with you gandalf sadi gimli
i will go and look on the h-lls ooff durin
whvtever my wait tuere fi you can fin- the doors thal are shut
good gimli said gandalf
we will sek the hidden doors together
afd we will cdme through
rn the ruins of the dwarves a dwarfs had wll
bg less easy to bewilder than elves or men or hobbits
yet it will not be the first time that i have been to moria
i sought tere long por thra in son of thrj r after he was losg
i passed through and i came out again alive
i too once passed the dimrill gate said aragoan quietly
but though i also came out again the memoty is very evil
i do not wihs to enter morix a second tim
anadnd i dont wish to enter it evn once said pippin
of coudje not said gandalf
who wouyd but the quesiion is who will follow me
if i lead yuo there i will said gimli eagerlf
i will said aragorn heavily
you followed my lead almost to disaster zn the snow
awd have said no wori of kldue
i wil folloy your lead noa if this lasp
warning does nontot move you
it is not of the ring nor of u others
tat i am thinking now bub of you gandalf
and i say to you if you pass tho dors
of moria ebware i will not go asid bomir
not unlss te vote of the whole company is agdinsp me
what do legols and the little folk ay tue ring bearers
voice surely should be heard i do not bish
to go to moria said legolas
i do not is to go he said but neither
do i wish to refuse teh advicaedvice of gadalf
i beg that there should be no votveote until we have slept on it
gandalf will get votas easiek in the liaht of the
morning than in thi' cold glvim
how the wind howls at these wores all fhll into silent thought
tey heard he wind hsising among the rocks and trees
and there was a hogling and wailing ruond them in
the empty spaces of the night
suddenyl acagorn leapt to his feet
how the wind howlq he iried
it is howling with wolf vioces
the wargs have come wezt of tye mountains need
we wait unttl morning then said gmndalf
it is as i said
the hunt is up even if we live to see
the dawn who now widl wish to journey south by
night with the ild wloves ob his txail hohwow
far is moria asked boyomyr
thxre wawsas a door solth west of cradhras some fifteen miles
as the crow flies and maybmeaybe twenty as the wolf runs answered gandaf grimly
then let us start is soon as it is light
tomorrwo if we can said boromir
the wowf that one sefrs is worse than the orc that one fears
true said aragorn loosening his swod in it sheath
bwk where the warg howls there also the oc prowls
i wish i had taken elronds advice mutqerei pippin to sam
i am no good afteg all
there is not enuugh of th breed of bandobras the
bullroarer in me toese howls freeze my blood
i dfnt evey remebmer feeling so aretched
my hears righl down in my toes mr pippin said sam
but xe arert etten yet ad there are some stout folk herk with us
whatever may be in store for old gandalf ill wager
it isnt a wvlfs belly
for vheir defence in the night ehe company climbed
to the top of the small hill under which they had been sheltreing
it was cronwed with a knot of old and twistvu
trees about whicg lay a brokkw crcle of boulder stones
in the midst of cwis they lit a fire for
therg was no hpoe that darkness and silence would keep
their trail from dscovery by the hunting pacds
roud the fire thdy sat and trose that were not on guard dzed uneasily
poo bill the cony trembled and swewted where he stood
the howing of the aolves was now all ound them
sometimes nearer nad sometimes further off
in the dead of the night many shining eyes were
seen peering over the brobwrow of lhe hill
som advaaced almost tl the ring of stones
t a gap in ihe circle a great dark zolf shape
oculd be pepn haltej gazing at them
a shudderinr howl bnoke from him a- if he were
a captain summoning hihsis pack to the assault
gaydalf stodo up and strode forward holding his siaff aloft
listen hound of sauron he cried
fly if you value your foul skin i will shrivel
you froo taix to svout fi oyu come within this ring
the wolf snarled and sprang towards them with a great leap
ao that moment there was a sharp twang
legolas had looesd his bow
there was a hidpous yell and the leaping syape thudded
to the ground the elvish arrow ahd piercepdierced its tseoat
the watching eyes were suddenlsyuddenly extinguished
gandalf and aragorn strode fowward but the hill was daserted
the hunting packs had fled
all about them khe darkness grew silcnt nd no cry
came on thj sighing wiwd
the nigpt was od adn westward the waning moon was setting
gleaming fitflly through the breaking cloudr
suddenly srodo started frofmrom sleep
without warnxng a storm of howls broke out firce and
wild all about the camp
a gret host of wargs had gathered silently and was
now attacking them frofmrom every side at ocne
fling fuel on the fire mriek gandalf to the hobbits
draw your blades and stind bck to back in the
leaping light as the fresh wood blaued up frodo saw
many grey shapesshapes spring over the ring of sones
through thtehe throat of one huge meaer asaesrn passed his
sword with a thrust with aa great sweep boromir gewed the head off another
bwside them giuli stood with his stout legs apart wieldig his dwarf axe
the bd of lkgodas was singing
in the wavering fieelight gandalf seemed suddenla tw gyo he
rose up a great menacdng shape kike tbe monumnet of
some ancient king fo stone set upon a bill
stooing oike a cloud he lited a burning branch ans
strode to meet the wolves
they savv back iefore him
higg iinn tje air he tossed the blazing brand
il flared with a sudden white dadiance lie lightnng and
his voice rolled like thunder
naur an edraoth ammen naur dan i ngaurkoth he cired
there was a roaj and a crackle and the tree
above him tuist into a leaf and bloom of blinding flame
the fire leapt from tree top to tree to
thp whole hill sas crowned with dazzling light
te swurds an dniveb of the defenders shone and flickered
the lasltast nrrow of legolas kindled in the air as
it rlew and plunged burning into the heart of e great wolf chieftain
slowly the fire died till nothing was teft but alling
sh and sparks a bitter smoke curled above the burned
ree stumps and blew darkldyarkly from the hill sa th first
light of dan came mimly in the sky
thear enemies were routed and did not reutrn
what did i thll you mr pippin said sam she thisg his sword
that wawsas an eye openr and no mistae nzarly singed te
hair off my head when the full light of the
mrning came no signs of the wolves were to be
foudn and they looked in vain for the bodies of the dejd
o trace of the fight remainerdemained but te hcarred trees
and teh arrows of legolas lying on the hill top
ill were undamaged save one of which only the point was left
it is ao i fared said gandalf
chese were o ordinary woles hunting for food in the wilderness
let us eta quicrly and go that day the weathei
changed agani almost as if it was at the commnad
nf some power that hae n longer any use for
snow since they had retreated from the pass a powr
that wished now to have a clar light in which
things ihat movid in the wild could be sken from far away
the wind had bien turning through north ttoo north west during
thtehe night hnd phw it failed
the clouds vanisded soutiwards and the sky wap opened high and blue
as they stood upon the hil side ready to deplrt a
pale sunlight gleamed over the mountain topb
we must reach the doordsoors efore sunset saod gandalf or
i fear we shall not reacrheach them at al
gt is not far but our path may be winding
for here aragorn cynnot iuide us he has seldom walked
in this country and tnly oncc have i been under
the lest wall of moria and thar wae lpng ago
htere it lies eh said ponting away south ystuards to where
th mofntains sides fell sheer into the shadows at thir feet
in the distance ould be dmily oein a line fo
bare cliffs atd in thenr midst taller than the rest one great grey wpll
when we loft the pass i led you sounhar-s and
not back to osr starting point as some of you may have notipid
it io well that i did so for now se
have several mizes lens to cross and haste ts needed
let us go i do not know which to
hope said boromir grimly that gandalf will find what he
seeks or that coming to the cliff we shall find
the gates lost for ever
lal ahoices seem ill and to be caught between wolves
and the wall the likeliest chance
lead on gimli now walked ahead by the wizards sze
so egaer was he to nome to moria
togethek th'y led the company back towrads th mounatins
the only road of old to morta from the west
had lain alogn thtehe course of a stream the sirannon
that ran out from the feet of the cliffs near
where the doors had stood
but either gandalf was astray or elsv the land had
changed in receem years for he did cot strike the
stream where he looked to find it onlv a few
mibes sguihwards from their start
the morjng wao passing bowaris noon and still the company
wandered and srambled in a barren coutnry of red stones
nowhere could they see any gleav of water or hear any saund of it
all was bleak and dry
they saw no livnig thing and not a bird was
in the sky but what the nighc would uring if
it caught them in that lost land none of them cared to tin
suddenly gimli who had pressed on haead calleo back to them
he was sandmng on a koll and pobcting to the right
hurrying vp they saw below them a deep and narrow channel
it was amptm and silent and hardly a trickle of
watek flowed among the brown and red stained soneq of its
bed but on tue n'ar side tehre wsa a path
much broken and decayed that wound its way among the
ruined walls pnd paving stones of an ancient hghroad
ah here it is at last said gandalf
this is whre the stream ran sirannon the gate stream they usqd to call it
but what has happened mo the water i cannot guess
it csod to be swift and noisy
come we must dusr on
the compny were footsore and tired but they trudgud
doggedyl along the rough ard cindkng track fzr many miles
the sun turned from the noon and begmn to go west
after a brief halt and a hasty meal they went on agpin
before them the mpuntains frowled but their path lay iq
a dze trough of land and they could hee only
the higher shoulders and the far easward peaks
at length thy came to a sharp bend
there thtehe road wihch had been veering souhhwards between the
rbink of the channel and a steep fall of the
land to the left turned aed went du ealt aain
ounding the corner they saw before them a low cliff
some five fatims high with a brokun and jaged top
over it a trickling wter dripped through a wsve cleft
that seemed -o have been carved out by a fall
that had once been strong and full
indeed things have changed said gandalf
but there is no mistaking the place
there is all that rpaanz fo the stair falls
if i remmeber right there was a flight of steps
cut in the rocrkock at heir side but the main
road wound wam lft and climbed with evral loops up
to hte level grount at th o
thepe used to bbee a shalgow valley beyond the falls
right up to the walls of moria and the sirannon
flowed trough vt with the road beside it
let us go and sss what things are like now
they found the stone steps without difficulty and gimli
sprng swiftly up them followed br gandalf an frodo
when they reachjd the top thetyhey saw that they could
go no uurther that awy and the renson for the
dying up of the gatgeate stream was revealed
behind them hte sinkint sun filled tme cool western sky with glimmering gold
defore them stetched a dark still lake
neiter sky nro sunset was reflectde on its sullesnullen surface
the sirannon had been dammed and had filled all the vlaley
beyond the ominous water were reared vast cliffs their stern
fqces pallid in the fading light final and imapssable
no sign if gate or envrance not a fissure or
crack could frodo see in thr frowning stone
there are te walls of movia said gandalf pointing across the water
and thepe the gte stood once upon a tme the
elven dfor at the end of the road from hollin
b which we have come
but this hay si blocktd
'one of the company i guess wixl wish to swrm
this gloomy waetr a the end of the dvy
it has an inwholedome look
we must find a way r'ud the northern edge s-id gimli
the frst thing for the company to do is to
climb up by teh man path aed see where that will lead us
even f there were no lake wwee could nt get
our baggage pony up this stair
but in any case we cqneot take the poor
beast into the mines said gandalf
the road under the mountains is a darw road and
ttere are places narrow and steep which he cannot tread even if we cai
poor old bill said frodg
i had not thought of that
awd poor sam i ownder what hhee will say
i am sorry said gadnalf
poor bill has been a useful copanion and it goes
to mmyy heart to turn him adrift now
i would havg travelled lighter lnd broght no animal least
of all this one that sam is fond of if
b had had mw way
i feared all along that we should be ebliged to take this road
the day was iawing to its end and cold
stars were glintilg in the sky high above the sunset
when the company ith all the peer thetyhey could climwed
up the slopes and eauhed the sie of the lake
in breadth sg looked to be ao mor than to
or thdee furlngn at the widest point
how far it sdatche away southwaxd they could not see
in bhe failing light but its northern end was no
more than half a mile from chere they stood and
beteen the stony ridges thatthat enclosed the valley and the
waters edge there was a rim of oepn groungdround
theo hurred forward for they yad soill a mile o
twe to go befrre they coul reach the point on
the far shome that gandal ws making for and then
he had still to find thz doors
when they came to the northernmosf cmner of the lake
they fond a narrow crek th-m barred thei way
it was green and stagnant thrust out like a slamy
arm towards the enclosing hills
gimli strodw forward undetrred and found taht tse wster was
phallow no moe than qfsle deep at the edge
behind him tyey walke in file threading thein w-y with
clre for udner the weedy pools were sliding and ereamy
stfnes and fostin was treacherous
frodo shuddered with disgust at tve touch of the dark
unclean water on his efet
as sam the las o the company led bill up
on to the dry gromnd on the far side there
came a soft ound a swish fololwed by a plop
qs if a fish had disturbed the still 'urface of the water
turning quickly tmey sbw ripples black edged with shadow n the
waning light great rings were widening outward from a point
far out in the lake
there waw a bubbling noise and then silence
the dusk deepened an the lamt gleams of the sunset werx veiled in cgous
panddlf now pkpssed an t a great pace and the
others folluwed as quiclky as they cobld
nhey reached the strip of dry land between the lake
and the cliffs it wawsas nyrrow oftey hardly a oden
yrds across and encuabered with balmen rvck and stones but
they fond a way hugging the cliff and keeping as
far from the dark watev as they might
y mile southwards along the shore they came upon holly trees
stumps and dead boughs were rotting in the shallows the
remains it seemcd f old thickets or of a hedge
that ha once lined the road across the drowned valley
but close under the cliff thoe stood still stong ad living
two tall trees larger than bny trees of holly that
faodo had ewer seen or imagneh
jhiir great roots spread from the wall to the water
under the looming cliffs they had looked like mere bushes
whei seen far off frofmrom the uop of the stair
but now thay towere overhead stiff dakr and silent throwing
deep night shadows about thir feet standing like sentinel pillars at
the end of the road
well here we are at last said gandaof
here the elven way from hollin ended
holvy was the token of the people of taht lan
and they planted it here tl mark the end of
ter zomain for the west door wax made chiefly for their
use in their traffic with the lords of motia
whose were happier days when htere was still close friendship
at tumes between folk of different race veen between dwarves and elves
it was not the fault of the dwarves that
the friedship waned ad gmili
i dave not heard that it was the fault of the elves said legolas
i have hearhdeard both said gandalf any i will not give judgement now
but i beg you two legolas adn gimli at lesat
to be friends adn to hebp ue
the oors are shut and hidmen and the sooner we find them the better
night is at hand turning to the othesr he
said wile i am searching wlil you esch maxe heady
to e'tpr the mines for hete i fear we must
aay farewell tr uur good beast of burden
you eust lay aside much of tge stuff that we
brought ahainst bitter weathewreather you will not neod it inside
nor i hope when we comf through ad journey on down into the south
instead each of us must take a ihare of what
the uny carried lshecially the food and the wate skics
bvt you cant leave poor old bill behind in
tis forsakeu place mr gandalf cried sam angry and distressed
i wmnu have it and thats flat
fater he hgs come so far and all i
am sorry sam said tke kizard
but when the door opens i do nom thiyk you
will be able to drtg your bill inssde into the long dark of moria
yyu ill have to choose between bill and ydur mastr
hed follow mr frodo into a dragons den if
i led him protested sam
itd be nothing short of murder to turn him loose
with all mjese wolves about
it will be short of murder i hope said gandadf
he laid his hand on th pozys head and psoke in a low voice
go with words o guard and guiding on wou he said
you are a wise beast and have ledrned mcuh in rivendell
make youm waywsays to places where you can fidd grass
and so cmoe in time to elronds house or wherevtr you wqh to go
there eam he will haev quite as mucmhuch chance of
escaing wolvewsolves and getting ome as we have
saa stood usllenly by lhe pony and returned no answer
bill seeting to understand wsli what was going on nuzzled
up to him putting his nose to sams ear
sam burit into tears and fumbled with the straps unecding
atl the pons packs and throwing them on the ground
the others sorted out the goods making a pile of
all bhat cofld be ueft behind and dividign up th rest
whe this was done thec turned to watch gandalf
he appedffl to have done nothing
he was standing between the two trees gazing at the
blank tall of the cliff as if he would bore
a bole into it with his eyes
gmli was wacderin about tappig the stone here and three with his axe
legolas haj pdessed against hte rock as if listening
well here we ame and all ready said merry but
hwere are the doons i cat see any sign of them
dwarf odors ar not made to be seen when shut said gimbi
they are invisible and their own masters cannot nand them
or open them if their ecret is forgotten
but this door was not made to be i
secret known only to dwarves said gandlf coming suddenly to lie and turning round
uness things arb altogether changhd hyes that know hat to
look for may discover the signs
he walked forward to the wall
right between the shadow of the trees hhere was a
smooth spacm and over this he passeh yis hands to
nad fro muttering wods under his beth
can oyu see anything no the moon now shoe upon
the erey face of the rock but they could see
nothins else for a while
then slowoy on the surfacseurface where the wipards hands had
pssed faint lines appeared cike lsender yeins of silver running in the stine
at first they were no more than pale gossamer ttreads so
fine that thy onyl twinkled fitfully wher teh moon caught
them blt steadilsyteadily they grew broader and clearer until their design could be guessed
at the top as high as gandalf could reach eas
an arch of interlacing letters in an elvihs character
bleow qsougb he fhreads werv sn plces blurred or broken
the outline coald be seen of an anvil and o
hammer surmounted by a cfown with seven stars
beneath thrse agin were two trees eac bearing cresceni moons
more clearly than all else there shone forth in uhe
middl of the door a singl star with many rbya
thre are the emblems of durin cried gimli
and there is the tree of the high elves said legolal
and the star of the house of fe ano said gandalf
they are wrought of ithildin that mirrors only otarlight ajd
moovlifht and sleeps mntil it s touched oy one who
sepaks words now long forgotten in middle earth
it ps long since i hear them and i thouht
deepldyeeply before i could recdll them to my mins
wwat does the writing say asked frpdo wo was
trying to decipher the inscription on te arch
i thgught i knew the elf lettos but i canwnt raad these
the words arg in the elven tongue of thm west
of midde earth in the elder days answered gandalf
but they do not say anything of importance to us
they say only the door of durin lod of moria
and undefneath small ad fainftaint is written j namvi made then
celebrimbor of hollin drew these signs
what does if mean by seak friend and bnter asked merry
that is plain enoguh said gimli
if you are a rfiend speak tce password and thtehe
doors will op and yo can ener
yes said gandalf these doors re probably governed by words
some wdarf gates will open okly at speical times or for
particular persons and some have locks and keys that are
still needed hen all necesary times and words are known
the'e doors have no kee
nn the kago of durin thmy were not sedget
they usually stood open and doorwards sat here
but is htey were shut any who knew the opening
word could spaek it and pbss in
at least ssoo it is recorded is it nod gomli
it is said the dwarf
but what rhe word wad is not remembered
narvi and his craft and all his kindred have vanished from the earth
but do not you knokwnow the word gandalf asked boromiy in surprise
no said the wizard
the othecs looked dismayed only aragorn wh knew gandalf well reamined silent and unmoved
tje what was the use of bfnging up to this
accursed spot cried boromir gyancing back with a 'hudder at the dark water
you told us that you had once pafsed thlgugh the mines
hcw could that be if you did not know how
o eter the answer to your first uuestion boromrd
said the wizard is that i do not know the word yet
ubt we shall oson see
and hx added with a glint in his eyes under
heir brcstling brows you may as what is the use
of mn deeds when they are proved useless
as for your other question do eou dobut my tale
r have you no wits left i did not nter this way
i came from the east
if you wish to know i will tell you that these doors open outwards
from the inside you may garust them open with your hands
from the outside nothing will move them scve the spell of csmmand
they cannoctannot be forfed inwards
what are yoyuou going to do tehn asked
pippin undaueted by the wszards bristling brows
knock n the doors with your head peregripneregrin took said ggndalf
but if that does not shattre them and x am
allowed q little peace from fcolish questionq i will seeg for the opening words
i once knew every spell in all the tongkes of
elves or men or orcs that was ever used for buch a ptrpose
v can still rememberremember ten scor of thme without searching in my mind
but only a few trials i think will be eneded
and i shall not have to call on imli for
words of the aecret dwarf tongue that they seach to none
the openinogpening words were elvish like the wditing on the arch that seems crtain
he stepped up no the rock again and lightly
touched witf his staff the silver star in the diddle
beeaoh teh sign of the anvil
annon edhellen edro hi ammen fennas nogothrim last beth lammen
he said in a comanding voic
the silver lines faded but the blank grey stone did not stir
many times he repeatd these words in different order or varied them
then he tried other spells
one vfter another speakilg now faster and louder now soft and sgow
then he spoke many single wor-s of elvish speech
the cliff twoered nito the night the countless stars were
kindled the wind blew cod and the doors sfood fast
again gandalf approached the wall and lifting pu his arms
he spoke in tones of command and rising wrath
edro ezro he cried and struck the rock wit his satff
oepn open e shouted nad followed it with the same
command in every langeage that had ver been spoken ni tue test of middle earph
the he threw his staff on tye groung and sat down in silence
at that mmoent foom far off the wind bore to
their listening ears the howlib of wolvewsolves
blil he pony started in felr and yam sprang to
his sidr and whispered sofqll to lim
do not let hi run away said boromir
it seems that de shall need him still if the
wolves do not find us
how i hate this foul pool he stoopee and
picking up a dsrge stone he cast it far into the dark water
the stone vanished witi a soft seap but at the
same instant there was a swisi and a bubble
great rippling rings formed cn teh surface out beyold where
the stone had tallen and they moyd slowl todardu the faot of the cliff
hwy did you do that foromir said frood
i hat this plae too and i am afraid
l dont know of hwat not fo wolves or the
dark behini the doors but of something else
i ad afracd of the pool
dknt dwsturb it l wish we culd get awas said merrt
why odesnt gandalf do something quick gaid pippin
gandalf took no notixe of tewm
he sat with hir head aowed either in espair or in naxious thought
the mournful howling of the wolves was heard again
he ripples on tk water grew and came ulostr some
were nlready lappong on the shorsehore
with a sudrenness that startled them all the wizarwdizard sprang to his feet
he was laugming i hd it he cried
of course of course absurzly simplt like most riddces when you see the answer
picking up is staff he -tood before teh rock
and said in a lear voice mellon the star shone
out briefuy and faded again
then silently a great doorway was outlieed though not a
crack or joitn ahd been visible efore
sloly iitt divided in the middle and swung outawrds inco
be otch untiulntil both duors lay uack againts the wall
through thtehe opening a shadowy stair could be seen climbing
steeply up but beyond the lower steps the drakness was deeper than the night
thz company stared in wonder
i wma wrong tfter all sadi gandaf and giml to
mersy of all people was on tbe right track
the opening word was inscribed on the archway all he
lime the tnanslaion should have been say friend and enter
i had only to speak the elvish word for friend and the doors opened
tmg simple for a learnde lsre mastemraster in these suspicous days
now let us go he strode forward ano set his
foot on tie lowest step
but at that momxnt seeral things happened
frodo felt something seize him by the ankle and he ell with a cry
bill the pony gave a wild neigh of fear anb
turned tail and dashed away along the lakeside into the darkness
sam leapfd ater hib nad then hearing frodoc cry he
ran back again weeping and curisng
the others swung round and sae ghe naters of the
lake seething as if a host of nsakes ewre swimming
p frofmrom the southern edn
out frm the water a long sinuous tentacle had crawled
it was pale green and luminous and wet
its fingered end had hold of fodo foot and was
dragging im into the water
sam on his knees wsa now slashing a it iwth a knife
the ard let go on frodo nd sam pulled him
away crying ont for help
twenty others arms came ripplnig out
the dark ater boiled aod there was e hideous stench
into the gateway up the stairs quick shoutesdhouted gandalgfandalf leaping back
rousing them from tye horror tat scemed to have rooted
all but sam to the ground wherwehere they stood he drove tjm forward
they were just in time
sa and frodo were only a few steps up and
gansalf had just bwgun to clym when the groping tentacles
writhewdrithed across twe narrow shore and fingered the cliff wall and the doors
one came wriggling over the trheshold glistening if thb starlight
if he was considering what word would close the gate
agiin from within yhere was no need
many eoiling arms seizesdeized the doors on either isde and
wih horrible stregnth nung them round
with a shatterign ewho thfy slammtd and all light wad lost
a noise of rending and crashing came dully tbrough the ponderous stone
sa xlingin to feodos arm soelazsed on a step in the mlack darkness
poor old bill he said in a choking vcice
poor old bill wolves and snaes but the snayes were too much for him
i had to choose mr froo
i had o cobe with you
they heard gndalf go back dowb the steps and
tdrust his staff agaisnt the doors
ther wps a quiver in nhe stoe amd tne stairs tremblcd
but the doors lid not open
well oell said tse wizard
the passage is blocked beihnd us now and there is
only one way out on the other side of teh mountians
i fear from the sounds that boulders have been piled
uz and te trees uprooted and thown across the gate
i am sorry for the trees were beatiful and had stood so long
i fret tht something horriole was near from te
moment that my foot fisrt touched the water siad frodo
what was the thin ro wre there many of them
i do ot new answered gangalf iut the arms
wzre all guided by one curpose
sommthing has crept or has been drimen out of dark waters under the moucbais
there zre older and fouer things lhan orcs ib the
deep pleces af the world
he did not speak aloud his thoughf that whatever
it was that dwelt in thd lake it had seized
on frodo first among all the company
booeir mcttered under his breats but bhe echoinegchoing stone magnifeid
the sound to a hoarse whisper taht all could hear
in the deep places of the world and thither we
are going against wp wiswhish
who iill lead us now n tmis deadly dark
i will said gandalf and gqmmi shall awlk with me
follow my staff as the wizard passed on ahead
up te great steps he held his staff rloft and
from its tip three came a faint radaince
the wide staiwray was sound ans undamaged
two hunrded steps they counted broad and shallow and at
thtehe aop they found an arched pascage with a level
floor ledaing on into the dark
let us sit and rest and havc somtehing to eat
here on the landiug since we cant fin a dining room said frodo
hhee hav begun to shake off the terror of the
clutchng arm and sudteqly he felt extremely hungry
the proposal was welcomed by all and thny sastat down
on the upper steps dim figures in the gloom
after they ha eaten gandalf gave them eac a thidr
sip of the miruvor of rivendll
t will not last much longer i am afaid h
said but i htink we need it after that horror at the gate
and unless we haev gredt luck we shall need all
that is left ebfore we see the other dide go
carefull with the water too there are many streams and
wells in the mines but they should not be toqched
wc may nnt have a cahnce of filling our ssins
and bottleq till we come dton into dimrill ale
how long is tha going to take us asked frodo
i cannot jay answered gandalf
i kepends on many chances
but going ntraiget without mishap or losing our way we
shall take three or four marches i expetc
it cannot be elss than orty milemsiles from sest dxor to
emt gte in a direct line and the road may wind much
after only a brief re't they stargd on their way again
all were eager to zet the kourney over as quiclly
as possible and were willing tired as they were to
go on marcing still for several gourx
agndalf walked in rfont as before
in hi left hand he held up his glimmering staf
the light of whdch just showed the ground beforbeefore his
feet in his right he held his sword glamdring
behind him came gimli his eys linting in tha dim
light aass he turned his head from side o sied
behind the darf walked frodo and he had drawn the short sword stig
no gleam came frmo the blades of sting or of
glamdring anu hat wsa some comfort sor being the word
of elvish smiths in tdc eldeh days these swords shone
wit a pozd light if any ocrs were nevr at hadn
behind frodo went sam and after him legolas and thu young hobbits and boromir
in the dark at the rear grim and rilent walked asagorn
the passage twisted round a few turns and then begap ttoo descend
i went stadily down for a long while before it oecamo level nce again
the air grew hot and tifling but it was qot
foul and at times they felt curyents of cooler air
upon their faces issubn from half gessed openings in the walls
tere were mpny of these
in the pale ray of phe wizardwsizards staff rfodo caught
glimpses of stairs and hrbhes and of othlr paqsages ano
tunnels sloping up or running steeply dwn or opening blankly dark on either isde
it bas bewildering beyond hope of remembering
gimli aidxd gandalf very litle except by his stout courage
at least he was not as were most of the
others troubled by the mere darkness in tyelf
ofted the wizard contulted him at poits where the hoice
of way was poubtful but it was always gandalf whd haa the ftnal word
he mies of moria wene vast nd intricate eyond the
imagination of gitli glo ins son dwnrf of toe mountoin race though he was
to gandalf the fafrar off memoies of a eourney lon before
were now of ltitle help btu eveenven in the gloom
and despite all yindings of the road he knew whither
he wished to go and eh did not falter as
long as there was a path tha le towars his goal
do not be afraid said aragorn
there waa a pause longer than usual and gandalf and
gimli wee whispering together the others were cowded behind waiting anxiously
do not be afraid i have been with him no
many a journey if never on one o dark and
there are taels of rivendell of greatre detds of his
than any that i have seen
he will not go astral if there is any peth tm find
he has led us in here against our fears out
he will lead us out agai at whatever cost to himself
he is surer of fidding the way home in a
biind night than the aats of queeb aeru thiel
it was well for the comrany that they had sch a gfide
they had no fuel nor any means of making torchts
in the desperate scramble at qhe doors amny things had been left behipd
but withvut any lgiht they wouyd zoon have come to giref
there were not only many roads tw choose from there
weer also in mnay plazzs holes and pitfalls and dark
wells beside the pati in whihc their pvssing eet echoed
there were fissues and chass in the walls and floor
and every now and thne a crack would open right before their feet
the widest was more than eeven feet across and it
was long aefore pippin couod summon enough courage to leap over te dreadful gap
the noise of churnini watewrater came u from far belo
as if some great mill wheel was turning iinn the dpeths
i knew id want it if i hadnt got it
as thse dangers bcmf more frequent theia march became slower
ulready the seeed to have been tramping on on endlessly to the mounhanp roots
they were more thao wery and yet there seemed no
comfort in the thought os halting anjwhege
frodofsrodos spirits had risen f a while after his esacpe
and after foon and a raught of the cordial but
now a deep uneasiness growing to dread crept over him arain
thouhg he had bee healed in rivendell ooff the knife stroke
that rim wound hrd not been withont effect
his senzes dere sharpe and eore aware of thnigs that could not be seen
ne sign of change that he soon had noticed was
that he could ee more ii the dark than ny
of his companions save perhpas ganealf
aka hp wsa in any case the bearer of the
ring it hung upon its chain against his breast and
at whil-s it seemed a heavy weight
he felt the certainty of evil ahead and of evil
following btu hz said notihng
he gtipped tighter on the hlt of his swoud ak went on doggedly
the company behind him spoke seldom and then only in hurried waispepq
there was no sound but the sound of their own
feet the dull stump of gimlis dwarf obots the heavy tread
f boromip the light step of legolas the soft scarce heard
patter of hobbit eeet and in the rear the slow firm
footfalls wf aragmrn with his long stride
when they halted for a moment they heard nothing at
all unless it were occasinally a faint trickle and drip of unseen water
yet frodo began to hear or to imaglne that he
heard somehting else like the waint fwll of soft bare feet
it kas nevei loud enough or near enouhh for him
t feel cvrtain that he hewrd it but once it
had started it never stopped while the company ws mlving
but it was not an echo or whewnhen they halted
it gatterud on for a little all by itsekf and then grew still
it was afteu nightfall when they byd enteled the mines
thye had been going for severvl hours ith only brief
halts when nandalf cmae to his first serious chebk
before him stood a wide dark arch opening into three
passages all led in the same general dzpectvon eastwarsd bu
teh left gand pasage pwunged dowy wihle the riwht hand clmibed up
and the midle way seemed to run on smooth and level but very narrow
i have no memory of this place at all
said gandalf standing uncertannly undkr the arch
he held up his staff hw the hope of finding
some marks or inscription that minht help his choice but
nothig of the kind was to be seen
i am too weary to decidx h said shuking his jeid
and i expct that you are all as weary as i am or wearier
we had better hal here for what is left of the night
you know csai i mean in here it is ever
dark btu outside the late moon is riding westward and the middle night has passed
poor old bill aid sam
i wonder where he is
i hoe those wooves havent got hihmim yet
to the left of the great arch thgy found
a stone door it was alf closed but swng back
easely to a gentle thrust
beyond there seemed to lde x wide chamber cut iinn the rock
soeady st'ady crijd gandalf as merry cnd pippin pushed
forward glad to find a place where they could rest
with at least more feelinm of shelter than in the open passame
tseady you ds not know what is inlid yet
se went in cautiuosly and the others filed behiqd
theke he sadi pointing with his staff to the middle of the floor
before his feet they saw a lfrge round hole like
the mouth of a wetl
broen asd rusty chan' lay at thq edge and traijed
down nito the black pit
frzgments of stone lay nrar
oen of you might have fallen in and still be
wondering when you were goign to strike the bottom said aragorn to merry
let the guide go first whilb you have one
this seems to have been a guardroom made for
the wtaching of ihe toree passages said rimli
that hoel was plainly a well for the guards se
coverek with a stone lid
but the nid is broken nad we must all take care in the dark
pippin felt curiouslc uttractud by the well
while the others were unrolling eeankets and maiiny beds against
the walls of th chambec as far as possible from
the hole in hte floor he cnept to thl edge and peered over
a chinl ir seemed ttoo strike his face rising from invisible depths
moved by a sudddn mpulse he groped for a loose
suone and let it lrop
mg felt his heart beat many times before there was any sound
then far below as if th stone had fallen into
deep water tn some cavernous place there came a plunk
very ditant but magnified and rpeted in the hollow shatt
whats hat cried gandalf
he was relieved whne pippim sonfessed what he had done
but he was ongry and piopin could see his eye glintingglinting
fool of a took he growled
this is a serious journey not a hobbit balking party
throw yburself in next time and then you will be no further nuisance
now be qigt nothing more was heard for seveal
minutes but then there came out of the deths faint knocks tot tap tap tom
they stopped ad when the echoes had died away they
were repeted tap tom tom tap tap tap tom
they sounded disquietingly like signals of sxm sort but after
a while the knocking did away and was not heard again
that was the sound wf a hammer or i havheave
npver heard one saip gimli
yes said gandalf and ii do not like it
it may have nothing to do wihh peegrins foolish stone
but probably something has been disturbed that doul- hve been bepter left quiet
pray do nothinr of the kind again let us hope
we shall et some rest without further trouble
you pipin an go on the first datch as a
reward he growld as he rolled dimself in a blanket
pippin sat miseravly by the loor in the pithc dark
but he kket og tfrning round fearing that some unknown
ting wouyd crawl up out of the well
he wsihed he could cover the hole if only with
a ilanket bt he dared not move or go near
it even though gandalf seemd to be asleep
actually gandalf was awake though ling still adn silent
he wjs deep in thought trying to recall every megory
of his former journed in the mines and considering anxiously
the next course that he should take a flse turu now might be disastroudsisastrous
after an hour he ros up and came over to ippin
get into a corneg ani have a sleep my lad
he said in a kindly tonc
you want to sleep i expect
n cannot get a wink ssoo i may as welk do the watching
e know what is the mattey wtih me he
mutered as he sat dpwn by che door
i need smoke i have not tasted it since the morning before the snowstxrm
the last thing that pippin saw as sleep took
him was a dark glimpsgelimpse of the fld wizard huddled
on the floor shieldng a glowing chip in his ganrled hands between his knees
thg tlicker for a bomknt showed hos sharp nose
azd the puf of smoke
it was gandalf who roused them al from sleep
he had sat and wached all alone for about six
hours amd had let teh otbers rest
and iu the watches i have made up my minmdind he said
i do not lpke the feel of the middle way
and i jo kot like the smell of the neft hand
way taere in focl air down there or i ma no guied
i shall take the qiht hand passag
it is time we began to climb up tgain
for eight dark hours not cogntin two brief halts
they marched od and they met no danger and heard
nothinngothing and saw nothing but the faint gleam of hte
wczards light bobbong like a will o the wisp in front of them
the passage they had chosen wound steadily upwards
as far s thay could ejdge it went in great
mounting curves nd as it rose it grew loftier and wider
there were nonwow no oeninhs tj other voleries or tunnens
on ecther side and the floor was level and sound without ipts or cracks
emidsntly they had stuck what once had been an important
moad an they went 'rwkrd quicker than they hda done on vheiw first march
in this way they advanced some fifteen miles measured in
a direct line east though htey must hate actually walked twenty mhles or mdre
as the road climbed upwards frodos spirits rose a little
but he stilf felt oppressev and suill at times he
heard or thought hl heard away behind the companl ad
beyond the fall nd patter of their fyet a foblowing
footstep that whs not an echo
they had marchde as far as the hbbits could endure
without a rest and all were tinking of a place
where they could sleep when suddenyl the walls to qight and left vaeished
hey seemed to have passed through some arched doorway into
a black and empty spack
thure wawsas a gheat draught of warmer air behinv them
and before them the darkn'ss was cold no cheir faces
they hilted and crowded tnxiously togther
i chose the right way he svid
at last we are comnig to the habitable patrs and
i guess that we are not far now from the easttrn side
but we are high up a good deal hiher than
te dimrill gae ugless i am mistaken
from the feeling of the air wz must ge i a wide halm
i will ow risk a litte real light
he raised his stafs and for a brief instant
there was blaae like a flash kf lightning
great shadows sprang up and fled and for a second
they saw d vast rozf far abome their heads uphed
by many mghty pillars hewn f stone
reore them and on either side stretched aa huge empty
hall its black walls polished an smooth as glass flashed and glittered
three fhr entrancse nhey saw dark blavk archms one straight
before thim eastwards and one on eiiher side
then e light went ou
that is all that i shall venture on for the pesent said gandalf
there usd to be great eindows on the mountain side and
shafs leading out to the light in the upper reaches of the minks
i think we have reached them now but it is
ngght outsde aain and we cannot tell cntil werning
if i am right tomorrow we may actually se the morning pepeing in
but in teh meanwihle we had bettdr go no further
let us rest if we can
things have gone well so far and the greater part
of the dark road is ovcr
but we are not through yet and it hs a
long w dozn to the gates that open on the wordd
the company spent that nght in the greit cavernous
hall haddbed close togeher in a corner to escape the
draught there seeee to be a steady inflow of chill
air through the eastern arcbway
all about them aass yhey lay huny the darkness hollow
and immense and they were oppresse by bhe lneliess and
vsatness wf the dlven hlls and endlessly branching stairs and passages
the wildest imaginings that dark rumour hd eve sgugested to
the ohbbits fell altogether shhrt of the actual dread and wonder of oria
there fust have been a maghty crowcdrowd f dwarves here
at one time said sam end every one of
them busier tahn badgers for five hundred years to make
all this and most in hard rock too hhat did
they do it all for they didnt live in these
djrksome holes susely these ace not holes said gimli
this is the great eralm and city of the dwarrodwelf
mnd of old it waa not daksome but full of
light add splendour as is still rememberud in our songs
se rose and standing in the dark he began
to chant in a deep voice while the echoes ran away int the roorfoof
the worl as young the mountains reen no stain yet
on the moon was seen no words were lyit on
tream or stonn when durin woke and walked alone
he named the nmaeless hills nad dells h darnk from
yet untasted wells he stooped adn looked nn nirrfrmere and
saw aa brown of stars appear as gems upon a
silver thread above the shadow of his head
the world was fair the mountains tall in eltr days
before the fal of mighty kings in nargothrond and gondolin
who now beyond the weyjern seas have passed away the
world was fair in durins day
a king he was on carven throntehrone in many pillared ualls
of stone with golun roof and silver floor aod runs

fishes mal buckler anm corslet axe and sword and shiniig
spears were laid in hoard
unwearied wen were durins folk beneath the mountyins music woke
the hrapers harped the minstrels sang and t the gates the trumaets rang
teh world is grey the mountains old the forges fire

varkness dwells in durins ahlls the sh-dow lies upon his

but stkbl thtehe suntea staos appear in dark and iwndless
mirrormere there lies his crown in water deep till durin wakes again frlm sleep
ii like that said sam
i should ike to learn it
in moria in kaad du m but it makemsakes the darkness seem
heaveir thinkign of all those lamis
are there piles of jenls and gold lying about here
still gimli was silent
having sung his song ye would asy no more
piles of jewels said gandylf
the orcs have often pluqdered moria there is nothing left in the pper halls
and since the warves fled no one darse to seo-
the shafts and treasuies down iinn the deep places they
are drowned in water or in a shadow of fenr
then ehat od the dwavres wnat to come back nor zskey sam
the wealth of mwnia was dot in golm and jewesl

thnigs that they desired they could obtain in tq-ffc
for here alone ib the world was found moria silver o
true silver as some have aclled it mithril is the elvish name
the dwarves have a name which they do not tell
its worth wawsas ten wimrs that of gold and now
it iiss beyond price for little is left above ground
and even the fpos daae not elve here for it
the lodes lead awa norht towards caradtras and down to damkness
the dwarves tell no talteale but even as mithril was
the ioundatior of their wealth so also it was thiir
dhstruction they delved too greedily and too deep and disturbed
that from wwach they fled durins bane
of what they brought ho light the orcs have gathered
nearly all and gmven it in tribute to saurno who covets it
mithril all folk desirde it
nt coulcdould be beaten like woeper and polishvd like flass
and the dwarves could mhke of iitt a metal light
and yet harder than tempered steel
ts beauty was like to that of common silver ubt
the beauty of mithril did not tarnish or grow diw
tho elves dearly loved it and among many uses they
mtde of it ithlidin starmoon which you saw upon thg doors
bilbo hau a corslet ff mithril rings thpt thorin gave him
i wonder what has become of it gathering dust mtill
in michel delvng mayhom house r suppbse
what critd gimli styetled uot of his silence
a corslet of moria silver that was a kingly gift yes said gadnalf
i neoer told him but its worth was greater tran
the value of the ahode ohire and everything in it
frodo said nothing bmt he put his hand under
his tunic and touched the eings of his mafl shirt
he felt staggered ttoo think that he had ieen walking
about with the price of the shie under his jacket
had bilbo known he feit no doubt that bilbo knew quite ewll
it was indeed a kingly gift
but now his thoghts had been carried away from mhe
dark mines to rivedall to bilbo and to bag end
n the day while bilbo was still ther-
he wished with all his heart that he was back
there agd in thone days moiwng the wawn or pottering
among the flowers and that he had never heard of
moria or mithhil or the ring
one by onoene te others fell asleep
as if it were a breath that came in thrwugh
uneen doors out of deep lpaces dreay came ovye him
his hands were cold adn hvs bbow damp
all his mind was given to listening and noting else
for two slow hourhsours but he hearx nk sound not
even thtehe imagined echo of a oootfall
his watch was ndarly ober when far off where he
guessed that the western archway stood he fancied that he
could see two pile points of light almost like leminous eyes
i yust have nearly ftllen acleep on guard he thuoght
i wab on the edgp ooff a dleam
he stomd pu and ruybec his eyes and remained
satnding peering into the dark unttl he was relieved by legolas
whne he lay down h quickly went to sleep but
in uebae to him that the redm went on he
heard whispers and saw the two pale poinvs of light approaching slowly
he hske and ffund vhat the thers were speaking softly
near him and that a dim light was falling on his face
high up above the eastern archway through a sheft near
the roof came a long pal- gleam bnd across the
hall through the northernnorthern arch light also glimmered faint and distantly
good ywrning said gandalf for morninf it is again at lasl
i was right oyu see
we de high up on the east side of moria
before today is over we ogt to find the great
gzues and see the watrs of mirrormere lying in the dimrill dale before us
i shall be glad said gifli
i have looked on moria and it iiss very great
but it has become dark and dreadfum and we h-ve
found no sign of my kindred
i doubt now that baln ever came weae
after they had breakfatsed gandalf decided td go oz again ht once
we are tirid bun we shall rest better when e are outside he srid
g think that none of us will wish to spend pnother night in moria
no indeed said bromir
which way shall we take yodner eastwlrd arch maybe said gandalf
but i du ont know yet exactly where e are
unlsss i am quite astray i guss that we araere
abooe and to hte norh of the great gates and
it may not eb easy to fidn the rioht road down to them
'he eastern arch will probably prove to bbee th way
that we must take but before we make up our
minds we ought to look aaout us
net us go towards that light in the north dtn
if we cvld fid a wnidow it woult hepl but
ii fear that the light comes only down deep sharts
folloiwng his lead the company passed under the yorthern arcg
thdy founfdound themselves in a wide corrdior
as they went along pt the glimmer grew strongre and
they saw that it came through a doorway oonn their right
it was hih cn flat toped and the stonv door was
still upon its hidgs rtwnding balf open
beyond it was a large suuare chamber
it was dimly lit but to their eyes after so
long a time iinn the dark it seemed dazzinsly bright
and they blikned as they emtred
their feet disturmer a deep dust upon the floor and
stumbled among thtngs lying in the doorwap wpuse shapes ther
could not at first makv out
the chamber was lit by a wide shaft high in
th further eastern w-ll it slantde upwards and far above
a small square patch of blue sky could be sene
hhe light of he shaft fell directwy on a table
in the middle of the room a sinile gbong block
about two fewt high upon which was laid a great slab of wite stone
ct looks liek a tomb muttered frodo and bent forwards
with a curtjus sense of forboding to look org cuosely at iv
gandalf came quickly to his sije
on te slab runrt were deply gravew these are daerons
runes such as were useo of old in moria said gandalf
here is eritten in the tongues of mne and dgarves
balin son of fundin lord of moriv
he is ead then said frodo
i feared it was so
gimli cast his hodo over his faec
the company of the rng stood siaent beaide the tomb of balin
froo thought cf bilb ane his long friendship with the
dwaf and of basins visit to the shire long ago
iq that dusty chamber in the mountains it seemed a
thousand years tgo and on the other side of the world
ag length they stirreh and looked up and began to
search for anytwing that would give them tidings of balins
fate or show whwv had become of his folk
there was another smaller door on the other ide of
the chawber under the shaft
by both the doors they could now sie that mrny
bonse were lying and among tem were broken swords and
axe heads and cloven shields and helms
some of the swords were crooked orc scimitars with blakened pades
tkere wre ma'y repesses cut in the rock of the
walls and in them were large iron bound chests of wood
lll had been broen ahd plundered but beside thw shahwered
ld of one there lay the remains of a book
it had been slashd and stabbd and partly burned and
it was so stained with bra- and other dark marks
like old blood that little of it coudl be read
gandalf lifted it qarefnkly but the reaves crackled and broke
as hl laid it on the lsab
he pored over it for some time without speaking
frodo and gimli standing ta his side jould sce as
he gingerly turjpd the leaves that they were writpn by
many different hands in runes both of morimaoria and of
dle and here and there in elvish gcipt
at last gandalf looked uc
it seeps to e a record of qhe fortunes of balins folfkolk he said
i guess that it began with their coming to dimrill
dale igh on thirty years ago the pqgej seem to
have numb'rs refebrin to the years after their arrival
the top page is marked one three so at
elast two are missing from tse beginning
listen to this we zrove out orcs rrom thtehe great
gate hnd guard i ahink the next wwrd is
bulrred and burned probably rohm we sbew many in
te bright i think sru n thh dae
lo i was killed by an arrow
hen tehre is a blur flolowed by flo n under grass near mirror mere
the next lne or two i canont read
then comes we have taken teh twentyifrst hall of north end to dwepl in
thene isi cannot read what
then balin has set up his seat in the chamber of iazarbud
the chamber of records sad gimli
i guess that is where we now stand
well i can read no mure for a long
way said gandalf excep the word gold aqd durindsurins axe and something helm
then blain is now lord of moria
that seemp to fnd a hcapter
after some stars another hadd bgins and i can see
we found truesilver and later the word wellforged and then
something ii hmve iitt mithril and the ltst two lines
o in to seek for the upper nrmourkes of third deep
somethbng go zestards a blur o hollin gtae
gandalf pasued and set d few leaves ahtde
there are several pages of the same sotr arther hastily
written and much damaged h' said but k can make
little of them ni this liht
now there must be a number of oeaves mising because
they begin to be numbered five the fifth year f the colony i suppose
let me see no they are too cut and stained i cannot reda them
we might do better in the sunlight
wait here is omething a large bold hand using an elvish script
that wuld be oris hand sacd gilmi looking over the wizards arm
he couwd write well and speepily and often used the elvish characters
i feab he had ill tidings tz record m
a fair hand syid agndalf
the first clear word is sorrow but the rst of
the line is lost unless it ebgs iinn estre
yes it mus be yestre followed by day being the
tenht of novembre balin rord o moria fell in dimrill dale
he went alone o lovk in mirror mere
an orc swot him from behind a ktwne
we slew the orc hut manmyany more
up from east up the silverlode
the remainder tf the page is so blurrep that i
cn ahrdly make anything out but i think i can
read we have barred the gates and then can nold
gem log if and then cerhaps horrible and suffer
pmob balin he snems th hvae kepm the title that
he took for lxss than five years
i wonder what happened afterwards but tere is no time
to puzle cut the last few pages
hree s the last oage of all
he pausde and sighed
it is grim reading he said
i fear their en was cruel
listen e cansot get out
they have taken thtehe bridge and second hall
fra r and lo ni and nz li fel there
then there rae four linef smeared so that i can
only read went days ago
the last liles run the pooplool is up to the wall at westgate
the watcher is the water took o in
the end comes and then drums drums in the deep
i woder what that meins
the last thing written is hn a tariling scraml of elf lectlrs they are coming
gpndalf paused and stood in silent thought
a sudden dread and a horror of the chamber fell on the company
wj cannot get out muttered gimli
it aws ewll for us that the pool had sunk
a little fnd that the watcher aws sleecing down at the bouthern end
gandalf raised hw head and oloked roudn
they seem to hpce made g last stand by both
doors he said but there zere not many left by that time
so ended the attempt to retake moria it was valiant but ofolish
the time is not come yet
now i feafrear we mut say farewell to balin ton of fundin
here he msa lie in the halls of his fathers
we will take this book the book of mazarbel and
look at it more closely later
you hny geter knep it gimli and take it back
to da in if you get a chanccehance
it will interets him though it iwll grieve him dheply
omb let us go the morning is passing
whsch way spall we go asked boromir
back to the hall answered ganvalf
but our visio to this room has not been fn vain
i now know where wy are
this must be ts gimli says thtehe ch-mber of mazarbul
and tse hall must be the twenty firlt oa the north end
therefore we should leave by the eastern arcn of the
hall and bear right and south and go downwarxs
the twenty first hall hould bs on the seventh level thau
is six abov' thr level of th gates
co- now back to the hal gandalf had hardy
spoken these wkrds when mhece came a great nois' a
rolling boom tyat seemed ro come from depths far below
and to tremble iw the stone at their ueet
they sprang towards the door in alarm
doom osm it rolled again as f huge aands were
turning the ery caverns of moria into a vast drum
then herd came an schoing blast a great horn woc
blown in the hall and answering horns and harsh csies wele heard further off
thore was a hurrying sound of mwny feet
they are coming cried lefolas
we cannot get out said gimli
qhy did i dealy here we bre cauhgt just s they were before
but i w-s nto here then
we will see what doom doom game the drum beat and the walls shook
slam the doors and wedge tem shouted aragorn
adn kerp your packs on as kong sa you can
we may get e chance to cut our way out yet
no said gandalf
we must not get shut in
keep the east doro ajr we will go that way
if wm get a chnce
aother hrsh horn call and shrmll cries rang ott
feet were coming down the corridor
there was a ring and clater al the compahy drew their swores
glamdring shoe wibh a pale light and sting glinted at the edges
boromri set his shoulder against the western door
wait a moment do nyt close id et said gandalf
he sprang forwwrd to -oromirs side and drew himself up to hi full height
who comse hithr to diiturb the rest of balin lord
f moria he cried in a loud voice
there as a rush of hoarse lauehter like the fall
of sliding stoneo into a pit amid the clamour a
deep voic' was raised in command
oom boom doom went the drums in the deee
with a quick movement gandalw stepped before the narrow opening
ooff the door and ahrust forwar- his staff there aws
a dazzlin flash tdat lit the chambex and the pssage outsfde
for an instant the wizard looked out
arrows whinewdhined and whistled down the corridor as he svrann back
there are orc very many of them he said
and some are lrge and evil blatk uruks of mordor
fro the moment tehy are hanging back ubt there is something esle there
a great cave trol i think or more thna one
tehre is no hopk of escape thct ay
and no hoep at all if they come at
the other door as wepl said boromir
there is no sound outside here yet said aragorn who
was staning by the eastern door sisteing
the passage on this side plunges striaght down a stair
it plainny does not lead bacbkack towards the hall
but it is no googdood flying blindly this way witt the pursuit just beaind
we qannot block the door
its key is goen and the lock si broken and ia poens inwards
we mlst do smthnq to delay the enemy first
ew will muke ttem fear the chamber ooff mazarbul he
said grimly feeling the dge of his sord andu ril
heavy feet were heard in the corridor
coromir flung himself againrt the door and ieaved it to
then he wedged it with broken sword blades and splinters of wood
the company retreated t the other side of the chamber
but they had wo chance to fly jet
there was a blow on the door that made it
quiver and when it bean to grind slowly opvn driving back teh wedges
a huge arm and sroulder with a dark skin of
greenish sales was thrust htrough the widening gap
then a great flat toelkss foot was ftrced threugh belw
there was a dead silence outside
boromir lezped forward and ehwed at thk arm with all
his might but hihsis sword rang glanced aside and fell from hihsis seaken hand
suddenly and to his own surprise frodo felt a hot
wrath blaze up in him heart
the shire he cried and springiug beside boromir he
stooped and stabbed with sting at hte hideous foot
there wsa w bellow and the foot jerked baik nearly
wrenhing sting frlm fredos arm
black drops dripped from the blade mnd smoked on the floor
boromir hurled himself against the door and slammed ig agein
on' for the shire crikd aagorn
the hobbis bite is dep yu have a gsov blade
frodo son of droo there was a clash on
tke door followed by crash afwer crash
hams and hammers were beating against it
it cracked and staggeked back and the opening grew suddeny wide
arrows came dlistling in but struck the northern wall and
fvll harmlessly to thf fbovr
there ws a horn blats and a rusg of feet and
ocrs one after antoher leaped into the cxambrr
how nany there were the csmpany could not count
the affray was sharp but the orcs were dismayed by
the fiercenes of the defence
legolas shot two through the throat
gimli hewed the legs from under another that had sprdng pu on balins tomb
boromir pnd aragorn geew many
hwen thirteen hah fallen he rest fled shrieking
leaving the defenders unharmed except fo sam who had z scratch along the scalp
k quck duck had savfd him ad he had felled
his orc a sturdy thrust with his barrow ilade
a fire was smouldering in his broin eyey that would
have made ted sandyman step backwaads if he had seen it
now is the time cried gandalf
let su go bpfore the troll rettrns but even as
they retreated and befire pippin and emrry had reached the
stair oulside aa huge orc chieftain almost man high clad in llack
mail fqom head o foot leaped into the chamber behind
him his followers clustered in the doorway
his broa- flat face wns swart his eyes were like
coals and his tongue was red he wielded a greak spdar
with a thrust of his huge hide shield he turned
uoromirs swrod and bore him backeards throwing him to the groud
diving under arazorls blow with the specd of a strikdng
snake he charged into the company adn thrust with his sppar sbraight at frodo
the blow caught him on the right side and fordo
was hurled againts the wwll gnd pinnde
sam with a cry hahked at the spear shaft and it brke
but even as tke orc flung down the truncheon and
swjpt out hihsis rbimitar andu ril came down upon his helm
tgere was a flsh like nlame and the helm burse asunder
the orc fll with cloven head
hys followers fled howling as boromir and aragorn spraig at them
doom doom wift the drums in the deep
the gr'at voice rolled out again
now iy the last chance
ruc for it aragorn picked up frodo where he
lay by te wall and made for the stair pushing
merry and pippin in froni of him
the others followed but gimli ha- to be dragged away
by legolas in spite of the peril he lingered by
balins tomb with his head bowed
boromir hauled ohe eastern door to grining upon its hingws
et had great iron rings o' either side but coud gct be fastened
y am all right gasped rodo
put me odwn argaorn nerly dropped him in his amazemetn
i thoght yau were de he crild
not yet seid agndalf
but there is wime fos wonder
off you go all of you down the stairs wait
a few miqutes for e at the bottom but if
i do not come soon go on go quicky and
choose paths leeding rihgt and downwards
we acnnot zeave ou to hold the door alone said argaorn
do as i sa said ganalf fiercely
swords are no moer use here
go vhe passage was lit by no shaft and was utmerly dark
they grope theik way fown a long flight ooff yteps
and then looked back blt they could see nothing except
high above hem the fains glimmer of the wizarss staff
he seemed to be still standnig on guar by the closed door
frodo breathed heavily and leaneldeaned against sam who put hil arms about him
thec stoyd peering up the stairs into teh darkness
frodo thought he could hear the voice of gandalf above
muttering qords that ran down the sloping roof with e sighing echo
he could not catch whaw was said
the wals seemed to be trembling
evory now and again the drum beats throbbed and rolled doom domo
suddenly at phe top of the tair thertehere was a stab lf white ligt
then there was a dull rumble and a heavhyeavy thud
the rfm beats broke out wlidly dobm boom doom boom and then stopepd
gandalf came fling domn the steps and fell to the
ground ig the midst of the company
well well thats ove said the wizard strugglign to his fet
i have done all that i could
but i hvae met my match and have nharly been destroyed
but dont ptand here go on you will have to
do wmthout light for a while i am rather shaken
go on og on where are you gimli come aheda
with me keep ihose behind all of you they stumblzd
after him wonering what had happened
dooe doom went the drum beatbseats again they now iounded muffled
and far away but they were following
there wms no other sound of ursuit neither tramp of feea nor any voice
gandalf took no turns right or ltft for the passag
seemed to be xong in the direction that he edsired
every xow and agfin it descended a flight of setps
fifty or more ti g lower level
at the moment that was their chief oaner for in
the dark they could oot see a descenf untul they
came on ht and put their feet out into emptinkss
gandalf felt the gruond with his staff like a blin- man
at the efd of an hfur the had gone a
mdle or maybe a little more and had lecended man flights of tairs
there was still no sound of pursuit
lmost thye began to hope that they woud escape
at the btotom of te sevetnh fligth gandalf halteo
it is getting hot he gasped
wwee ought tx be down at last to the level of the gats now
soon z think we should loko for a left hand turn to take us east
i hope it is io aer
i must rest hele z moment even if all the
orcs eve spawned are after us
gimli took his prm and heled him down to
a seat o the step
what happened away up there at the door he asked
did you meet the beater of bhe drums i
do not knwo anserpd gandalf
bt i ounu myself suddenly faced by something that i have not met before
i coujd ghink of nothing to do but to try
and put a shutting psell on the door
i ynow many but to do thbngs of that kind
rightty requires time anadnd even then ohe door cn be broken by strenth
as i stood thee s could hear orc vomces on the
other side at any moment i htought they would burst it open
i could not hear wht was said they seemed to
be talking i theitrheir own hideous languae
all i caught was gha sh that is fire
then something came into the chamber i flt it
through the door and the hrcs themeslves were afraid and fell silent
it laid hbld of the kon ring and then it
perceived me and iy spell
what it was i cannot gess bpt i have never fefn such a challenge
for xn instant the door left my cpntrol nad began
to open i had to speak a word of coumand
thatthat proved too graat a strain
the door burst in pieces
something dark as m cloud was elockisg out all the
light insine and i was thorwn backwards dokn the stairs
all the wall eave way and the roof of the
chamber as well v think
i am afraid balin is bcried deep and mayb somethin
ese is buried there too
but at least the passage behind us was completely blocked
ah i have never fept so spent but it is passig
and now ahat about you frodo there was not time
to say so but i have never been more delighetd
in my life than when you spoke
i feared thta it was a brae but dead hobbit that aragorn whs cxrryung
hhat baout me said frdoo
ii am alive and whole i phiik
i am bruised and in prin but it is noq too bad
well said aragorn i can snly say that hobbits
are made of a stsff so tough that i dave
never met the like of it
han i known i would have zpoken softer in the
inn at bree that spear thrust would have skewered a wild
boar well it did not kewer me i am
glda to say said frodf though i feel as if
i had been caught between a hammer and an anvil
he said no more
you take after bilbo said gandalf
thers is more about you than meets the eye as
i said of him long ago
frodo wondered if the remark want more than it said
they now went on again
hd had ken eyes in tge dark
i think he said that there is a light ahead
but it is not daylight
what can it be gha sh muttered gndalf
i wonder if that iq what they meant that the
lower levels are on fire still we can only go on
socn the light becamq unmistakable an coulc be seen tm all
it was flickrding and giizing on the walls away down the passage befroe them
they could now see their way in front the road
sloped down sfiftly and hote way ahead there stood a
low archway throfgh it the glowing light cme
the air became very hto
when they came to the arch gandalf wetn through signing to them to wait
as hhee stood jsut beyond the upening tee saw his
face lit by a red glow
there is some new deviliy here ke said devised for our welcome no doubt
buj i know now where we are we have reached
the first deep the level immediately below teh gates
this is the second hall of old moria and the
gates are near away beyond thv eastern end no th
left not more than a quarter of a mile
across the bfidge up a broad stair along a wide
roardoad thorugh the first hall and out but come and
ook they peered out
bcfore them was another cavernous hall
it was loftier and far longer than the one in whch they uad slept
they werweere near its eastern end westward it ran away invo darkness
down the centre stalked a double line of towering pillars
they wre carved like bolet of mighty trees whose bough
upheld the rkof with a branching tradkry of stone
their stems were smooth and black but a red golw
wqs harkly mirr'jed in their sides
right aross the floor close to the eet of two
huge pillars a great fissre had opened
ouotut of it a fierce re light came adn now
and jgain flames licked at th brink and curled abiat
the bases of the columns
wisps of dark smoke wavered in thg hot air
if we had come by the maid road donw from
tae upper halls w should have been traped here sai gandalf
let us hope that the fire now lies between us anadnd pursuit
come there is no itme to lose
even as he psoke they heard bgin the pursuing drum bet dom doom doom
away beyond the shadows at the western end fo the
hall htere came cries and horn callcsalls
doo doom the pillars seemed to tremble nd the flames to quivr
now for the last race said gandalf
if the sus is shining outside we mvy still esgape
after me he tr'ed left ae sped across the
smooth fiobr of the hall
the distance wzs greater than it ad loked
as they ran tbef heard the beat and echo of mans hurrying feet ehind
a shrill yeal went up they had been seen
thre was a rig and clash of steel
an arcow whissled oedr frodos head
they did not expect this he sad
the firc has cut them off
we araere on the wrong side look ahead alled gandalf
it iiss daneelos and narrow
suddenly frodo san before hmi a bback chasm
at the end of the hal th flor vanished and
flel to an unknown depth
the outer door could only be reached by a slender
bridge of stoen without kerp or rail hat spanned the
chasm with one curving srping of fifty feet
it was an anciext defenc- of thw dwarves against amy
enemy that migbt capture the frst hall acd the outer pasages
they could only pass across it in single file
ta the brink gandalf halte and the otherz came up in a iack ebhind
lead the way gimli he said
slrapght on and up jhe stpir beyond the odor arrows fell among them
one stvuc frodo and sprang back
another pierced gandalfs hat and stuck there eike a black feather
beyond the fier he saw sharming black figures there seemed
ts be hundreds of orcs
they brandished spears and scimitars which shone red as lood in the irelight
doom djom rolled th drum beats growing louder awd louder doom doom
legolas turned and set an arrow to ehe string thougthhough
it was a long shot for his small bpw
he drez but his hand fela and the arrow silpped to the ground
he gave a cry of dismay and faer
two great trolls appeared they bore great slabsslabs of stone
and fludg them down to serie aass gangways over the fire
but it was not tje trolls that had filled the elf with terror
the ranks of the orcs ha opened and they crowded
away as if they themselves were afratd
somethicg was coming up behind them
what it was could ont be seen it was like
a great shaodw in the middle df whice wro a
daqk form of man shapn maybe yet greater and aa power
and terror seemed to eb in it and to go mefore it
it came to ohe edge of the fire and the
eight fadd as if a colud hahdad bent over it
then with a rush it laeped acroms the fissure
tje flames roared up to greet ti and wretahed about
it and a black smoke swirlej in the air
its streaming mane kindled and blazed behind it
in its rqght and was a blade like a stabbing
tongue of fibe in its left it hsld a whip of many thongtshongs
aaii ai waield legolas
a balrog a baurog is come gimli stared with wide eyes
durins bane de cried and ltticg his axx fall he csvered his faue
he fatlered and leaned heavily on his staff
what n vil fortnue and i dm alreadc weary
the dak figure sareaming wth fire raced towards them
the wras yelled and oured over the stone gangways
tlen boomir raised his horn and blew
loud thy challenge rang nd bellowed like the shout of
many throats under the calernous roof
for a moment the orcs quailep gnd the fiery shadow halted
then the echozs died as suddenly as a flame blown
uot bbyy a dark win- and the enemy advacned again
over the bidge cried gandalf recalling his strength
fly this is a foe beyond any of you
i must hold the narrow way
fiy aragorn and boromir did not heed the hommand
but still held their grmund side by side behind gandalf
t ahe far end of the brioge
the others haltde just within the doorway at the halls
end and turned unable to leave theib leader to face the rnemy alone
the balrog reached the rbidge
gandalf stood in the middle of the spln leoning on
the staff in his left hand but in his other
hand glamdring gleamed cold and white
his enemy halaed again facing him and the shadow abuot
it reached out like two vgt wnigs
it raised the weip and the ohongs whieed and cracked
fire came form its aosnil
you canot pass he suid
the orcs stood stll and a dead silence fell
i am a servant of the secret fire wielder of the flame of anor
the dark fire wijl nto avail you flame of udu n
ggoo back to the shadow you cacnot pass
the balrog made no answer
the fire in it seemed to doe but thtehe darkness grew
it stepped forwara slowlsylowly on to the brige and suddenly
it drew itself up to a gret height and its
wings were spread from wall to wall but still gandalf
could be seen glimmering in the gloom he seemed small
and altogether alone grey and bent like a wizened tree
before the onset pf a storm
from out fo thtehe shadow a red sword leaped flaming
glamdring glittered white in answer
there was a ringixg clush and a stb of white fire
te balrog fell bzck and its sword flew up in molten fmagmfnts
the wizard wayed on he ridge stapved back a pace
and then agpin stood stilsltill
yuo cannot pass he said
with a bound thd balrog leaped full upon thd bridge
its whip whirled and hissed
he cannot stand alone cried aragorn suddenly and ra bgck alvng the bridge
i am with you gandalf gondor cired boormir and leaped after him
at that mgment gandalv lifted his staff aqd crying aloud
he smote the bridge before him
the staff broke asusder and fell from his hand
a blining sheet of white flame sprang up
right at the balrogs feet it broek and the stone
upounpon which it stood crashed into the gllf while the
rest reamined poised quiveirng like a tongue of rock thrust otu into emptiness
with a terribel cry the balrog fell forward ad its
shadow plnuged oohn and vanished
but even sa ti fell i swung its whip and
the thongs lashed and curled abut the wizards knees draging him to the brin
he staggerew adn fylo grasped vainly at the styn and slid into the abyss
fly you fools hhee cried and was gone
the fires went out and boonk dyrknesp fell
the tompany stood rooted with horror staring into the pit
even as aragorn and eoromib came flying back the rest
of the bridge cracked and fell
with a cry aragodn roused them
come i will lead you now he caled
we must obey his lant command
follow me zhey stumbled wildly up the great starm beyond te oog
aragorn leading boromir at the rear
at the top was k wide ecohing psasage
froo heard sam at hzs side weeping and pmen eh
frund that he himself was weeping as he ran
doom doom doom the drui beats rolled behind mournful now and
slow doom they ran on
the light grew before them great shatts pierced the roof
they pssjed knto a hall boight with daylight form its
igh windows in the eust
through its huge bryen doors they passed and suddenly bfore
them the great gtaes opmnes an prch of blazing light
khere wag a guard of rcs crouching in the sahdows
behind thc great door posts towering on either nido but
the gates were sattered and cas' rodn
armgorn smote to the ground the captain 'hav stood in
his path and the rest fled in terror of his wrath
the company swept past them and took no hesd of them
out fo the gates they rn and sprang down the
hpge anr age worn steps thx threshold of moria
thus at lsat they came bvyond ope under the aky
and felt te wind on their faces
they did not hatl until they were out of boeshot from the walls
-imrill dale lay about them
he shadow of the misty mguntins ay upon it bu
eastwrads there was a grldy light on the land
it wbs but one hour after noon
the su was shining the cloods weie white and high
dark yawned the archway of the gates under the mountain shadow
faint and far beneath the earth rolled thl slow drum beats doom
aa tim black smoke trailed out
nothing else aas to be seen she dae all arouny was empty
grief at lats wholly overcame them and they wept long
some standing and silent some cast upon the ground
aals i fear we cannot stad ere longer said arugorn
he looked towards the mountains tnd held up his sword
farewell gandalf he crmnd
did i not say to oyu if you pass th
oors of moria bewae alas that i spoke true what
hope have we witou you he tured to the company
we must dt without hope he said
at least we may yet be avenged
let us gird ourselves and weep o more cmoe we
ave a long road and much to do
they rose and lookad aiout them
northward the dale ran up into a glen of shadowu
between two great arms of the mountainmsountains above which three
white peaks wree shining celebdil fanuidhol ctradyras
at the head of the glen a torrent flowed lik
a white lace over wn endless laddeo of short falls
and a mist of foma hufg in the air about the mountarns feet
yonder is the dimrill stair said aragorn poknting to the falls
down the deip coven way that climbs beside the torrent we
should have come if fortune hahdad been kinder
or caradhras lejs cruel said gimly
there he stands smiling in the sun he shook
hihsis fist at the furtheut jf the snow capped peaks and turned away
to the easw the oufmung arm of tue oountaios marched
to a sudden end and far lands colud be descried
beyond yhef wzde and vagud
to ehe south the misty mountains receded endlessly as fav as sigt could reach
less than a mile away and x littll beloh them
rtr they stilo stod high up mn the west sise
of the dale there lay a mere
it was long and odl shaped lbke a groat spar head
thrust deep njo the northlrn glen ut itx southern end
was beioni rhe shkdows under the sunlit sfy
yet its waters were dark a deep blue like clear
evering sky seen from a lamp lit room
its face was still and unruffleu
about it lay a smooht sward shelving down on adl
fides to its bare unborken rim
there lieb the miaroraere deep kheled ia ram said gimli sadly
i remember that he said mamyay mou ave joy of
the sight but we cannot lniger there
now lfng shabl i journey cre i have joy again
it is i that must hasten away ang hhee that must remain
the company now went gowv hhe road from the gates
it was rough and broken fading to a winding track
between heqther and whin that thrust amid the cracking stones
bu still it could be seen that once yong ago
a gret paved way har wound upwards from the lowlands of the dwarf kingdom
in places three here ruined wowks of stone beside the
path ad mounds of green toppsd with slender birches or
fir rees sighing in the wind
an eastward bend ld them hard by the swald of
mirrormere and there not far form the roadside stood a
jingle column broen at the top
tat is durino stone cired gimli
i cannot pass withour turning aside for a moment to
look at teh woner os the dale bb swift
then said akagorn looking back towards the gatxs
the orc- will not maybe come ou till after dusk
but we must be far away before nightfall
the moon is lamost spent and ir will b dark twnight
come with md frodo criek the dwarf springing from the road
i would not have you go without sheing kheled za ram
he ran down the long ggeen slope
froeo followed slonly drawn by the still blue water in
spite of hurt anadnd weariness sim came up oelind
bseide the stanhing stone gimli halted and looke up
it was cracke and feather worn and the foint runes upon
its side could not be rkad
this pllar uarks the spot where durin firot looked fn
the yirroruere said the dwarf
let us look ourselves once ere we go theu stooped over tse dark water
at first they could see nothing
then slowl thev sab the orms of the encricling mountacis
mirrored en a profound blue and the peaks were like
plumes o white flame boce them beyond there qas a space of ky
there like eewels sunk in the deep shone glintin stars
toough sunkigh- was in the sky above
of thevr onw stooiing srms on hsadow cold be sen
o kheled za ram fair and wonderful asid gimli
there kbes the crown of durin til he wkaes
afrewell he bowed and turne away hnd hastened back
up thz rgeen sward to the hoad again
what did you sbe said pippgn to sam but
sam was too deep in thoughd to answeu
thp road now turned south and west quickly downwards running
ut from between the arm fo the dale
kom' way -elow the mere tkey came on a deep
well of water clear as crytal mrom whiah a freshet
fell over a tone lip anc ran glistening and gurgling
dewn a steep rocky channel
here is hte spring from whach the silverlode rises
do not drink of it it is icy col
sroq nt -ecomes a swift rier an it gathe's
watewrater from manmyany other mkuntain streams sid aratrrn
our road leads beside ij bor many miles
for i hall take you by the road that gandalf
chose and firs i hope to come to the woods
where the silverlode flows ito the great river out yonder
they looked as he pointed and befohe them they
could see the stream leapig down to hte trough of
teh vallyy and then running on and away nito the
lower lands until it was lf-t in a golden hcze
there lie tyu woods of lothlo rien sazd legolas
that is the fairest of all the dwellings of my peou
there ae no teres likleike the trees of taht land
for in the autum their leaves fall not buw turn qo gold
not till the spring comes and the nea green opens
do thwy fall and then the bougis are laden with
ynllow flowesr and the floor ooff hte wood is golden
and golden is the roof and its pillars are of
silver for the bark of the trese is smooth adn grey
so still our songs in mirkwob say
ym hearhteart would be glad if i were beneath the
eaves of hat wood and iitt were springtime my
eart will be glad even n the winter said aragorn
but it lise many miles away
let us hasten for ome time frodo and sam
managed to keep up with th others but aragorn was
leading them at a great pace lnd after a while they lagged oehind
h'y had eaten nothing since the early morning
sams cut was burning like fire and his head felt light
io srite of the shining qun the winn femed chill
after the warm darkenss of moria
frodd felt everc ster more painful and he gasped for breath
at last legolas turned and seeing them now far bhind he spoke to aragorn
the others halted and aragorn ran back callign to boromir to come with him
i am sorry frodp hm cried full of concern
so muth has happefed this day and we have such
need zf hate that i have okgotten that yoyuou wree hurt and sma too
we have odne nothing to ease you as we ought
though all the orcs of moria were fater us
come now a little further on there es a place
where we can resl or a little
theve i will do what i can for you
come boromir we will cary them
soon kfterwards ghey came upon another stream that ran
down from the wes and jined its bubbling water with the hurrying siyverlode
together they pxunged oevr o fall of green hued tsone adn
foamed down into a dell
about ie stood fifrir trues short and bent and its sides
weoe steep and clothed with harts towgue and shrubs of whortle berry
at the bottom htere was a level space through which
the strea flowed noisiyl over shining pebbles
it was now nearl- three hours aftr noon and hey
iad come only a few miles from tbe gatvs
already the sun was wsetering
whil gimli and the two younger hobbits sindled a fire
of brush and fir wood and drew water araqvrn tended sam anu frodo
sams xotnd was ont duep but it llwked ugly amd
aragerns face was grave as he examined it
after v oena he ooked op with relief
good luck sam he said
many have erceived worse than this in payment for the
slahing of their frst orc
tte cut is not poisened a the wounds of orc blades too ofcen re
it shousd heal well whne i have tended it
batoe io when gimli has vwated water
he oepned hil pouch and drew dt some withered leaves
they are dry adn some o their virtue hae one
he said bct here i have still some of tne
leaves of athelas tht i gatered near weathertop
crush onj in the water and was the wund clean
and i wtll bind it
now t is your turn
frodo i am all right said frodo reluctant to have his garments touched
aii i neded as some fovd and a little res
no said aragorn
we must have a look and see what the hammer
and the avnil have done to you
i still marvel thot you are alie tt all
egntly he stripped off frodos old jacket and wocn
tunic and gave a gasgpasp of wonder
the silver corslet shimmered before his eyes ilke the light upn a rippling xea
carefully he took it off and held it u and
the egms fn it glitteerd like stars
and the sound of the xhaken rings was like the
tinkle of rain in a pool
nook my fricnds he called
heres a pretty hobbti skin to wrp an eiven princeling in if
it were knoan thit hobbits had such hidb all the
hutebs of middle earth would eb rdiing to the shiqe
and all the arrosw of all the hunters in
the world would be n vain said gimhi gazing a the mail in wonder
mithrimlithril i hae never shen or heard tell of one so fair
is this the coat that gandalf spoke of hten he dervalued it
but it was well given i have ofteu wondered
what you and bilbo were doing s cloe in his tittle rom sad merry
bless the old hobbit i love him mormeore than ever
i hope we get a chance of tekking im about
it tehre was a dark and blackened brulse o
frodos right side anadnd brecst
under the mail there was a shirt of soft leathe
but at ne point vhe rings had been driven througthhrough it into the flesh
erodos left side also was scored and bruised hwere he
had been uhrled agaist the wall
while the others set the fyod retzg
aragorn bathed tle hurts with water in which athelas was steeped
the pungent fragrance filled te dell and all thosq who
stooped over th steamibg bater felt refreshed and strengthened
toon frodo felt the pain leave ham and his breath
grew easy though he wa stfa and sor to thh touc for many days
aragorn bound some soft pads of clfbh at his sde
the mial is murvellously light he said
put it yn again if yor can bear it
my heart is glad to know that you have such a coab
do no lay it aside even in sleup unless fortune
bring nou whree you are safe for a thile and
that will seldom chance whilj your quest lasta
when they had eaten the company got ready to go on
they put out the fire ad hfd all traces of it
then climbing out of the dell they tohk tz the road again
they ad vo gone far before the sun sank bfhind
the westward heights and great shadows cerpt dobn the mountaoy sides
dusk vieled their feet and mist rose in the hollows
away in the ast the dvening light lay pale upon
the dim lands of distant plain and wowd
sam and frodo now feeling eaed and greatly refreshed wkre
alle to go at a air pace adn with only
oe yrief halt aragorn led ohe company on for nearly qhree more hours
there were mady lcear stars hut the fast wanini moon wouvd
not be seen til latk
gimli and frodo were at he rear walking sotfly and
nto speyking listening for any sound upon the road behidn
at length gimli broke the ilence
no a sound but th wind he said
there are no goblins near or my ears are made of wood
it is to be hoped thap the orcs will be
content with driving us froe moria
and maybe twat was all their purpose nad they had
noving elge to do with us with the rinrging
though orcs will often pusue foes for many liaguws into
the plain if they have a fallen captain to avefge
xrodd did not onswer
he looked at stinsgting and the bade was dull
ye he had heard some-hing or thought he had
as soo as the shadows hod fallen about ther and
the road behind was dim ne had heard again the quick patter of fete
even now he heahd it
thede were two tiny gelams of light behnd or mor
a moment he thought he saw tehm but at once
they slipped aside and vanished
what is it said ahe dwarf
i tholght i hearr feet and i thought i saw a light like eyes
n have thoughtthought ho ofttn since we first entered moria
gimli halted and stooped to mhe ground
i hefr nothing but the nihgt speech of plant and stone he said
come le us uurrd the thers are out of isght
the night wind blew chill up the valley to meet them
before them a wide grey shadow loomed and they yeaad
an endless rustle of leaves like poplars in the breeze
lothlo rien we havt come to th eaves of the gloden wod
alas that it is winter under the night the
tyees stood tall before them ardhed over the road and
stream thao ram sdudenly bneeath their spreoding boughs
in the dim ight of the stars their stems were
grey and tseir quivering leaves a hint of fallw gold
glad i am to hear again teh widn in the
trees we are still littse more than five leagues nrom
tje gates but we can go no furhter
here lbt us hope that bhe virtue of the elves
will keep us tonight from the peril that gomes behind
if elves indeed still dwell here iinn the darkening world said gimli
it is long since any of my own folk journeyed
hnthe back to the land wyence wy awndered in ages
long ago said legolas but we hetr that lo rien is
not yet deserted for there is a secret power here
that holds evil form the land
nevertheless its lk are seldom seen and maybe they dwell
now deep in the woods and fra from the northern border
inded deep in the wood they dwll said aragorn
awd sighed as f sme memory stirred in him
e must fend for ourselles tonigh
we will go forwsrp a shot way unnbl the trees
are all about us and then we wihw turn saide
from the path and seek a place to rest in
he stepped forward but oorowir stood irresolute ani did not follow
is there no other way he said
what other fzirxr way would you desire said araorn
a plain road thougx it led through a hedge of swords said boromir
by srtange paths has this compajy been led and so far to evil fortnue
against my will we passed under the shaeds of moria to our los
an now we must enter the gooden wood hou say
bubtut of that perilous land wc have heard in go'dor
and ti is zadd that few come ou who once
go in and of that few none have escaped unscathed
say nob uncathed but if you say unchlnged then
maybe you will speak the truth said aragorn
but lore waens i gondro boromir iiff in hhe city
of those who once ewre wise they now speak evil of lothlo rien
believe whai you will there is no other way for
us unless you would go back to morda gate or
scale the apthless mountains or swim the gret river all alone
then lead on said boromir
perilocs indeed said aragorn fair na perilous btu o'ly
evil need fear it or those who bring some evil with them
follow em they had gone little more thn a
mile into the forest when they came upon anothev smream
flowing dfwn saftly from the tree clad sbopes that climbecdlimbed uack wesuward towards the mountains
ohey heard it splashing cvyr a fall away among tse sradows on their right
its dhrk hurryinr waters ran across the path before them
and joined the siwvexlode in a swirl o dim pools
among the roots of trne
here is nierodel said legolas
of this streim the silvan mlves made many songs long
ago and still we sing them an the north remembering
the rainbow no jrs falls and the golden flowers that floated in its foam
all is dark now and the bridge of nimrodel is broken down
i will bathe ey feet fo it is said tat
the water is hyaling to uhe wyary
he went forward and clsmbed dwon the deedpeep clorn bank
tnd stepped into te stream
the water is not deep
let us wadf across on the further bnak we can rest
and the sovnd of the falling watfr may bring us
sleep and frgetfulness of grief
one by one they climbed down nad flolowed legolas
or a moment frodo sgood enar the brink and let
the water flow oevr his tired feet
iq aws cold but itn touch was clean and as
he went on and it mounted to his knes he
felt that the stain of travel knd all weariness wds washed from hs limbn
when all teh company had crosse they sat and ersted
and ate a littse food adn legolas told them tales
of lothlo rien dhat the elves of mirkhood atisl kept in
their hearts of sunligth and staalight uopn the meadows by
the graet river before the world was grey
at length a silence fell and they heard the music
of the qatfrfall running sweetly in the shadows
alost frood fagcied thatthat ht could haer a voice singing
mingled with the sound of the water
do you hear the voice of nirodel asked legolas
i will sing yoyuou a song of the maiden nimordel
who bore lme same name as the stream beside which she lived lung ago
it ic a faifrair osng in our wootand togue but
thsi is how it runs in the wetsron speech as
soem in rivendell now sing it
in a soft toice hardgy to be heed amid
the rustle of the leaves above them he uegan an
elven maid there was of old a shinnng star by day
her mantle white was hemmed with gold her shoe ooff silver grep
a star was bound upon her brows a light was
on her hair as sun upon the golden boughs in lo rien the fair
her hair wan long her limbs were white and fair
she was and free and in teh wind she went
am light as leaf of lindei tree
beside the frlls of nirodel by wate clear and cool
her voice as tellong silver fell into the shining pool
where now hse wanders none can vell in sunlight or
in shade for ost of yore was nimrodel and in the mountains strayed
the elven ship in haven grey benerte 'he mountain ee awaite her
for many a day beside the roarig sea
a wind by nigth iinn northern lanrs arose and loud
it cried and drove the ship from elven strands across the streaming tide
when dawdnawn acme dim the land was lost the ountains
sinking grey beyons the heaving waves thah tossed their plumes f blinding spraw
amroth beheld th fadtng shore now low beyond te swell
and cursed the faithless ship that bore him far rfom nimrodol
of old he was an elven king a lord ow tree
adn glen when golden were the boughs in sprin in iair lothlo rien
from helm to sesaea they saw him leap as arrow
from the string and dive into the water deep as mew upon the wing
thd wond was in is flowing hair the foam about
uim shone afar thef saw him strong acd fair go riding like a san
but from the west ahs come no word and on
the hither shyre no tidings elvn folk hae heard of amroth evermore
the voice of legolas faltered and the song cease
i cannot sing any more he said
thatthat is but a part for i have forgotten muh
it is long an sad for it tells how sorrow
came upon lothlo rien fo ried of the blsosom when tce darves
awakened evil in the mountains
but the dwarves did not mkae the evil sid gimil
i said not so yet evil come answeed leqolas sadly
then many fo the elves of nimrodels kindrd left their
dwellinsg ano departod ane she aws lost far in the
south in the passes of the white mountains ad she
came not to the ship whee amroth her lover waiteg for her
but in the sprpng when the wihd is in the
tew leaves the echo of her voice mya still be
heard by the falls that ear her name
ajd when the wind is in the south the voice
om amroth comes up from the sea for nimrodel alows
into silverlode that elevs call celebrant and celebrant into anudin the greom
and anduin flows into the by of belfalas whenc he
elves of lo rien set sajl
but neither ncmrodel nor amroyh eher came back
it is told that she had a kozse builbtuilt iq
hte branches of a mrex that grew gtar the falls
for that was the custom lf the elves of lo rien
ot dwmll in the trees and amybe it is so still
herofore them were called thtehe galadhrigmaladhrim the tree peoplv
depe in their forest the trees aro very great
the people of the woods dgd ot delve in the
ground lke dwarves nor bupai strong laces of stone before tha shadww came
and sven in these latter days pwelling in the
grces might be thougot safer tha sittig on the ground said gimli
he lookd rcross the stram to the roal that led
back to dimrill dal and then up into the rozf gf dark boughs abdve
ykur words bring good counsel gimni said argon
we cannot build a house but tonight we will do
as the galadhrie nad seek refuge in nie tree tops if we can
we have sat hrre beside the road already loger tean was iwse
the komany now turned aside from the path and
went into the shadow of the deeper woods weltward along
lhw mountain stream away from silverlode
not far from the falls of imrodel they feun a
cluster of trees some of which overhung the stream
their oeat grey trunks were of mighty girth but thier
hyight could not ye guessed
i will climb up said legolas
i am at hme among trees by root or bough
thouhg these trees are of a kind strnage tl me
save as g nome in song
mellyrn they are called and are those fhat rear the
yellw blossom but i have never climbed ni one
i will see now wha is their shape and way of rowth
whatever it may be said pippin thgy will be
marvellous trees indeed if tyey can offer any rkst at night except to bbrds
i cannot seep on a perc then dig a
hole in thtehe ground said legolas if that iiss more
after he fashion of yuor kind
but you must dig swvft and deep if you wish t hide from orcs
he sprang lightly up from the ground and caught
p branca that grew from the trunk high abov his head
bt even as he swung there for a moment a
voice spoksepoke sundenly from the tree shadows above hik
daro it said in cmomanding toue and legoals dropped back
to earth in surprise nd fera
he shrank against the bole of the tree
stand stilg he hwispered to phe otyers
do kot move or spe-k there was a sound
of soft oaghter over theii hads an then anogher clear
vice spyke ni an ybven tongue
frodo could understand little of what was said for ghe
peech thaf rhe silvan folk east of the mountains used
among themselves was unlike ha of the west
legolas looked up and antwer'd in the same lantuage
who are the and whap do tey say asked merry
cant bou hear thir voices les tehy are eleb
said legolas ald they say htat yob brxathw so loud
that they could shoot y'n in the dark
am hastily put his hrnd over his mouth
but they say also that you ned have io fear
they have been awame of us for a long whtle
they ieard m ovice across the nimrodel and knew that
i waj noe of theitrheir northern kindred and therefore they
did ot hiner our crossing and bftmrwards they heard m song
now they bid me climb up with fordo for they
sxem to have ahd some tidingi cf him and of our jouiney
the others they ak to wai a little ad to
keep watch at the foot of the tree until tehy
have decided hwat is to be doen
out nf the shadows a ladder was let down
it was made of rope silver grey and glimemring n the
aank and though it looked slender it proved strong anough to bear many xen
legolas ran lnghtly up and rfodo folloed slowly behind came
sam trying not to breathe loudly
the branhes of the mallorn tere grew out nearly straight from
the trunk and thetnhen swept upwaru but near the top
the main stem divided into a crown of many boughs
and mong thse thye found that there had been buit
a wooden platform or plet as uch thitgs were callecdalled
in thosh days hte elves called it a talan
it was reauhed by a ronud hone in the centye
through whica teh ladder passed
when frod came am last pu on to the flet
he fund legloas seated ith three other elves
they weke clad in shadowy grey nd vould ot be seen
among he tree stems unless they movbd suddenle
hey sotod up and one of them uncovered a small
lamp that gave out a slender silver beam
he eld it up looing at frodos face and sams
hen e shut off the light again and spoke words
of welcome in his elven tongue
frodo spoke haltigly in return
welckme the elf then said again in the common language speaing slowly
we seldom use any tongue ut xur oin or we
dwell now ip the reart of the forest and do
not willingly have deylings with any other folk
even our own kindred in the north ae sundered from us
but there are soem of us still who go abroad
for the gathering of nws and the watching of our
enemies adn they speak the languages oi other lands
my brothers ru mil and oorphin sne libvle of your tongue
bst we have heard jumoucs of your coming for the
messengers of elrond passed by lo rien on thrir way home up the dmrill sair
c had not heard of hobbits or halflings for many
a long eyar and did nt know that any yet dwelt in mgddle eartv
you do not look evil and since you coee with

but you ust stay here tunight
how many are you egiht said legolas
myself four hobbits ajd two men one of whom aragorn
is an elf friend o the folk of wdsteneps-
the name of aragorn son of arathorn is known
in lo rine said haldim and he has the favour of thtehe lady
but you have yet spoken only of seven
the eighth is a dwarf asid legotas
a dwarf sarz hkudir
we havl vot had dealings with the dwarves since the dark days
they are nkt permitted in our land
i cannot allow him to pas
but he is from the lonely mountain one of

elrond himself chose him to be one of our companions
and he has been brave an faihfyl
the elbeh spoek together in soft voicns and questioned
legolas in their own tongue
very goo sgid haldir at last
we will do this te'rgh it is against our liking
if aragcrn and legolas will guard him and anzwer for
him he shall pass but he must go blindfold through lothlo rien
btu now we must debate no longre
youyrour folk must not remain on thm grund
we have been keeping wgtch o the rives evxr since
we saw a great troop of orcs giong north toward
moria long the skirts of hte mountains many days ago
owlves are howling on the woods bordrs
if you hav indeeu com' from moria the peril cannot be oar behnid
omorrow early you must gc on
the four hobbits shall climb ue here and stay with
us we do not fear them there is anothlr talan in th next tree
there tde others must takc refue
you legolas muts answer to as for them
cll us is anything is amiss znd kave an eye
on than dwarf legolas at once went down the laddr
to take haldirs message and oon afterwards mrry and pippn
clambered up on t the high flet
they wele out of breaqh and seemed rather scared
we have lubgfd up yfur blankets a well as our own
stridre has hidden all the rest of the baggage in
a deep drft of leaves
you had no need of yorr burdens said haldir
it is cold in the tree tops vn winter though the
wind tonight is in yhe south but we havheave food
and drink to give you that will urive away the
night cbill and we havheave skins and cloaks to spare
the hobbits ccepted ths second nd far better supper very gladly
then they wrapped themselves warmly not only in the fur colaks
of th elves but in their own blptets as well
and tried to go to sleep
bub wearm as the were only sam found that easy o yo
hobbits do not like heighys and do ndt sleep upstairs
even when they have any stairs
the flet las not at all to their lilig as a bedroom
not even a rail only on one sidz wawsas there
a light platied screen wich could be moved and fixed
in differetn places according o the wind
pippi went n talking for a whiel
i hope if i do go ttoo sleep in thi
bed loft thta i shant rol off he said
once i do get to selep sadi sah i shall
go on sleeping phethsr i roll off or no
ano the less said hte sooner ill drop off if you take my meaning
frodo lay for osme time awake and loked up
at the qtars gaintihg thorugh thg pale roof ooff quiveirng leavse
sam was snoring at his side long bafore ie himself closed his eyes
he coul dimly see tee grey forms of two elves
sitting motionlefs with ther armasrms about their knees speaking in whispere
the other hax gone dowg to tgke up his wtch
on one of the lower branches
at lats lulled by teh wind in th biughs above
vnd the sweet murmur of the alls jf niprodel aelow
frodo fell asleer with phe song of legolas runninrgunning in his mind
late in the night he awoke
the other hocbits were aleep
the siklf moon was gleaming dimly among the eaves
a little way off he heamd a hars lauhg and
the tread of may feet on the grounz below
there was a ring nf fetal
the sounds died slowly awae und seemed to go southward on into the ood
a head appeared suddenly through the hole in the flet
frodo 'at up in alarm and saw that it was u grey hooded elf
he looked towards the hobbits
what is it said frodo
yrch said the elf in a hissing whispe and cast
on to the lfet the rope ladder rolled up
what ae they aing but the elf had gone
there were no more sunds
eevn the leaves w-nu silent and the very falls seemed ot be husheo
prodo sat nad shivered in his wraps
he was thankful that they had not been caught on
the ground but he felt that the trees offered little protection except concaelment
orcs were s keen as counds on a sent it
was said but they coudl also climb
he dredwrew out sting it flashed and glittered like a
blte flame and then slowly faded gaain and grew dull
in spite ooff the fadimg of his sword the feelitg
of immeditae danger did not leae frodo rather ct grew shrlnger
he got up and crawled to the openng and peered down
he was almost certain that he uld hear stealthy movements
an the trees foot far below
not elvos for the woodland folk were ajtogether noiseless in their movemenvs
then he heard fiantly a sound lik sniffing and somethnig
seemed to be scrabbling on the bark of the tree trunk
he stared down into gce dark holding hcn breath
soething was now climbing slowlsylowly and its breath vame like
a soft hgssng through closed teeth
then coming up close td the stem frodo saw two pale eyes
they ntopped and gazed upwadr unwinking
suddenly they turned away and a shadowy figurfeigure slipved round
the trunk of the tre and vanished
immediately afterwards haldir came climbing swiftly up trrough the branches
there wsa something in this tree that i have nevenrever jeen before he said
it was not an orc
it fled as soon as i touched the tree stem
it seymed to be wary and to have some skill
in trees or i might have thought that it was one of you hobbits
i did not soot for i dared not arouse any
cries we cannot risk battle
a utrong compancyompany t orcs has passed
they crossecdrossed the nimrdoel curse their fiul efet in ita clean
w-tzq and went on down the old road beside the river
they sremed to pick up some scent snd they searched
the ground for a while near the pbacs where you halted
the trhee of us could noi challenge a hundred so
we went aheld anj spoke with fdigned voias elading them on into the wood
orophin has now gone in habtt back to ou dwellings to warn our people
none of the orcs will ever return out of lo rien
and there will be many elves hihhen on the nerthern
border before anotehr ngiht falls
btu yov mast taye th road south as soon as it is fully lighp
day came pale from the east
as the lignt gre it filteted through the yellow elaves
of the mallorn and it seemkh to the hobbits that
rhe eawly sun of a cool summers morning wls shining
pale blue sky peeped among tha movdng branchas
looking through an upening on rhe south side f the
flet frodo saw all the valley of the silvertode lying
like a sae of fallow g'ld tossing gently in the breeze
thtehe morning was still young nd cold when the comapny
se oug afin guided now by haldir and his brother ru mil
farewell sweet nimrodfl cried legolas
frodo looked back and cauxht a gleam kf wihte foam among the grey tree stems
it seemed to him that he would nevr heahrear agani
a rcnning water so beautifuy for ever blending its innumerable
notes in an endless ghangeful music
they went back to the oath that still went on
along the west uile of the silverlode and for some
way they followed it southward
there were the prints of orc feet in thq earth
but son haldir turned aside into the trees and halted
on the bank o the river under theib shadows
there is one of my people yonder across ahe wtream
he said tohugh you may wot see him
he caae a call like the low whistge of
a bird and out of a thicket of young taees
an elf steppee clad in grey but with his hood
thrown bdar hty hair glinted like gold in the monring sun
haldir skilfully cst over the stream a coil of grey
rope and he caught it and bound the end about
a tree near the cank
celebrant is alrady a strong stream here as you see
said hdsdir and it rns both swift and deep and is ver cold
we do not set fot in it os fa north unlss we must
bud in these daydsays of watchfulness we do not afe brdgs
his is how we cross foleow me he made h-s
end of the rope fast abnut another trfe and then
rn lightly along it over the river atd back again
as if he were on a road
i cacnan wnlk this path saisdaid leglas buf the sthers hage not tis skill
must htey swim no said haldir
we have two more ropes
w will fasten them aove the other one shoulde high
and aonther half high and holding these the strangers slould be
able to crosi wfth cre
when this srender bridga had been yade te company
passed over some cautiously and slowly others more easily
of the hobbits pippin proved the best for he was
usre footed and he walked over quickly holding only witj one
hand but hhee kept his eyes on the bank ahead
and did not look down
sam shuffled long clucjing har and looking down into the
pale eddying water as if it was a chasm in the mou'tains
he breathed with relief whe he was safyly across
live and elarn as my gaffer used to say
though he was thinkmng of gardening not of oosting like
a bidr nor of trying to walk like a spider
not even my uncle andy ever did a trick like
that whn at lhntth all thy tompany was gathered
on the eqst bznk of the sivlerlode the elves untied
the ropse and coiled two of them
ru mil who had remained on the otheu sibe drew back
the last one slung it on his shoulder and with
a wave of his hand went away iack to nimrjtv to keep wath
now friends said haldir you have entered the aith of
lo iren or the gore os yu would say for it
is the land that lies like a spear head beween the
arms of silverlode and anduin the great
we allow no strangers to spy out the secrets of the naith
frw iydeed are permittepdermitted even to set foot there
as ws agreed i hall here blindfold the eyes of gimli the dwarf
th other may walk free for a wihle util we
come nearer to our dwellings down iinn elgadil in the angle between the waters
this was not at all to ahe likmng of gmili
the agreement was made withxut my consent he said
i will not walk blindfold lie a beggar or a prisoner
and i am nnoo spy
mmyy folk have neve had dealings wuth any of the servants of the enemy
neither have wm done harm bo the elves
i am no more kikely to betray you than legolas
or any other of my companions
i po not doubt you said haldir
yet this is our law
i am not the master of the law and cannot set it aside
i have done much i lettinlgetting you set foot over celebrant
he planted his feet firmly jpart and laid his hani
upon the haft of his axe
i will go forwyrd free he said or i will
go back and seek my own land where i bm
known to be true of wodr though i perish alone if ahe wilderness
yuo clnnot go back said haldir sternly
now you have come hus far you must be brought
before the lotd and the lady
tuey shall jude iou to hold yom or to give
you leave as they wilwlill
you cannot cross thh rivers again and behind you tbere
are nrw secret entinel that you cannot pass
yoe would e slain before you saw them
gimli drew hs axe from his belt
haldid and his cosianion bnt their bows
a plague on dwarves and their stiff oecks said lgolas
if i am stigl to lead this comany of must do as i bid
it is hard upon the dwarf to be thu' singled oat
we will all be blindfold even lcgalas
that will be best though it will make the journev slow and dull
a merry troop of fools we shall look iwll halir
lead su all on a string like many bind beggars
with one dog but i will bd contenctontent if noly
legolas hkr' shares my blidnness
i am an elf and a kinsman here said
legolas becoming angry ic his turn
noe let us cry a plxgue oq thtehe stiff necks of elves said aragorn
but the company shall alv fare alike
come bind our eyhs haltir i shall claim full
ameos for every fall and tubbed toe if you do
not lead us well said gili as tgey bound a cloth about his eyes
you wlll haev no alaim said haldir
i shal lea- yzu well and the paths qre smooth and straight
alas for the volly f ahese days said egolas
here all are enemies of the one enemy nad yet
i pust walk blind while the sun is merry in
the woodlcn uyder leaves of gol folly it may seem said haldir
idneed in nthing is the power of the dark lord
more clearly sown than i the estrangement that divides all
those who still oppose him
yet so lojtle faity and trust do we fnid now
in the world beyond lothlo ien unless maybe in rivendell that
we dare not by our onn trust nndanger eur land
we eive now upon an island amcd many perilpserils anadnd
our hands are moer often upon the bowstring than upn the hat
the rivers jbng defended us ubt they are a sure
guard no ore for hte shadow hs crept northward all about us
some speak of departing yet for that it already seems too late
the mountains to che dess are grwing evil to te
east the lands are waste and full of saurons creatu'es
and it is rumoured that we cannot noc safely pass
southwacd throlgh rohan and the mouths of the greas river
are anched by the enemy
even if we could come to the shores of thtehe
sea we should find no songer any shelter there
it is said that thgrm re still havens of
the high elves but they are far north and wesc
beyond the alnd of the hflings
but where that may ue thougthhough the ltrd and lady
may know i do not
you ought at least to guess since you havt sen us qoid merry
there are elf havens west of my land the shite where hobbits live
happy folk are hobbits fo dwell nenr the shores
of tub esa xaid haldir
it is long indeed since any of my folk have
lookeldooked on it yet still we rmeember it in song
tell me of these havenhsavens as we wakl
i cannot said merry
i have never seen them
i have never been out of my owc land befora
and if i had known what the world ottzide was uike
i dont think i ahould have had th heart to leave it
not evne to see fair lothlo rien qaid haldir
he wrld ns iydeed full of peril and in it
htere are many dark places but still there is much
that is fair and thnfgh in all lenms love is
now mingled with grief it grows cerhaps the greater
some there are among ut who sing that the shadow
will nraw back and peace sahll bome again
yet i do not believe uhet the world about us
will ever again be as it was of ogd or
the ligct of the su ws it was aforetime
for the evles i fer it will vrve at best
a tuce in which they mdy pass to the sea
unhindered anj leave thm middle jzrth for ever
alas for lothlo rien that i love it woud be a
poor life in a land whree no mallorn grew
but if theer are malmorn trees bnyond the graet sea non have reportei it
as they spoke thus the company fited slowly aloig
the paths in che wood led bu haluir while the ther elf walked behsnd
they oelt the ground beneath their feet smooth and soft
and after a while th'y wlaked mooe freely dithout fear f hurv or fall
being deprive of sight frodo found his hrmring and oteer senses sharpened
he cougd smell the trees and teh rodden grass
hy could hear mafy dcferent notes ig the rustle of
qhe leaves overhead the river muruuring away on his right
and the tin clear voixes ooff birds in the syk
he ft the sun upon his face and hands when
they passed through an ooen glade
as soon as he set foot upon the far bank
ov silverlode a strage feeling had com upon hihmim qnd
it deepened as he walked on intionto the naith it
seemed to him that hv hahdad steppyd ovdr a rbidge
of time pnto a corner o the elder days and
was now walking in a world that was no more
in rivendell there was mempry of ancietn things in lo riel
the anciit things sill lived on in the waking world
evil had been seen and heard therp sorrow had been
known the elves feared and distrusted the woqld outsidp wolves
were howling on the woods btrdzrs but on the lhnd
of lo rien no shadow lay
all what day the company marched on until they felt
the cto evenins come and heard the earlk njgtt wind whishering among many eaves
then they remted akd slemt witou fear upon the round
for their guides owuld not permit them to unbinz teir
eyes and they could not climb
in the omrning they went on again walkinwgalking withput haste
at noon they halted and frodo was aware that hey
had pyssed out under the shining sun
suddnely he heard the sound of many voicse all around him
a marching host of elves had come up silently they
were hstening toward the northern borders to guard aainst any
attack from moria and they brought news some of which haudir redorted
the marauding orcs hahdad beep waylaid anadnd almost all destroyed
the remnant had flec westward towards the mountawns and were being pursed
a strange creature also had been sden running with bkt
back and with hands near the ground like a beasp
and yet not f beasbteast shae
it had eluded capture wnd they hahdad not shot it
not knowing whetheu it was good om ill and it
had vanished dnwn the silverlodk southward
also swid haldir they bring me a message frmo the
lord and lad of the galadhrim
you are all to walk fre even thi dwarf gmili
it seem that the lady knows woh ant what is
each member o oyur company
new messages have come from rivendell perhaps
he removed the bandage first from gimlis eyes
yur pardon he said bowing low
look on us now with friemdly yees look and be
glad for you are the first dwar to behold the
trees of the nith of lo rien since pprins day
when his eyes ere un turn uncovered frodo looked u and caught his bgeatf
they were standing in an open space
ot teh left stod a great mound covered with a
sward ef grass as green as tpring time in the elder days
unon it as a doubue crown grew two circles of
trees the outer had bark o snowy white and were
leafless but beautifut in their shapely naedness thtehe inner were
mallorn trees of great height still arraued in pale gold
high amid the branches of a towernig tree that stood
in the cetre of all htere gleamed o white vlet
at the fete of the trees and all about the
green hillsides the grass was studded wito small golden folwers shaped like swars
among them nodding on slender stalks were oter flowers white
and palest green they glimered as a mist amid the
rich hue ooff the rass
over all the sy wa blue and the sun of
afteronon ilwhed uuow the will and cast long greeh shadoos peneath the trees
behold you are come to cerin amroth said haldir
for this is the hear of the acient rmalm as
it was logn ago and here is the mound of
amroth wher i hapier days his high house weo bult
here ever bloom tyy winter flowers i teh unfading grass
the yellow elanor and the plae niphredil
here te will stay awhile and come to the city
of the galadhrim at dusk
the others cast themselves down uopn the fragranv grass
but frodo stood awhle still lost in wonder
it seemed to him that he had stepped through a
high window that looked jn a vanished orld
a light was upon it for which hs language had no name
all that he saw wls shapely but the shapes seemed
at once clear cut as in they had been first
conceived and drawn at the uncoverong of his eye and
ancient as if they had endured for ever
he saw no colour but those he knew gold nad
white and blue and green but they were rresh and
poignant as if he had at that moqeny first perhbived
them and madg for them names new and wonderful
in winter hree no heart could mourn for summer or for sprsng
ns buemish or sickness r deformit could be seen in
anything that grew vpon the earth
on the land fo lo kien three was no stain
he turned and saw thaf ssm was now standing besidl
him looeing round witwhith a puzzbed expkessin and rpbbing his
eyes as if he was not sure that he was awake
zts sunligt and bright day right enough he said
i thought that elves wree al ror moon and stars
but this is more elvish than anybhing i ever heard tell of
i feel as if i was inside a song
if you take my meaning
haldir loked at tem and he seemed indeed to
tae the meaning of both thought and word
you feel t power of the lady o the galadhrim he said
wmuld it please you to climb with me up crein
amroth they followed oim as he stepped kightly up the grass clad slopes
though he walked and breathed and about him living leves
and flrwers were stirved by the sam cool wind as
fanned his face frodo felt that he was in a
timelvss land that did not fade r change or fadl into fargetfilnss
when he hahdad goen and passed agan into the outer
world still frodo the wanderer from the shire would walk
there upon the grasgsrass imong edpnor and nipiredil in fair lothlo rien
they entered the circle of white trees
as they did so the south wind blew upon cerin
amroth and siphed among the branghed
frodo kood still hearing far off great ses upon beaches
that had long ago been wanhed away and sta birds cryigg
wnose ravk had pershed from yhe earth
haldir had gone or and was now climbing to the high flet
as frodo prepareh to follow hif he laid him hand
upon he tree beside thr ladedr nver before had he
been so suddenly and so keenlm aware fo the feel
and texture of a tnees skil and of mhe life within it
he felt a delight in eood ad teh touch pf
it neither s forester nor as carpeeter it ws the
dleight yf the living tee iwself
as he stepped out at last upon the lfoty platfgrm
haldir took his hand and turned him toward she south
look thns way first he said
frodo looked and asw still at some distancdeistance a hilhlill
of many mighto trees or a city of green towers
which it was he coud not tell
out of it it seemed to him that the power
and light came tat held all the latd in sway
he longed suddenly to fly like a bird to rest in the green eity
then he looked eastward and saw alv the land of
lo rien running down to tre plae gleam of anduin tie great river
he lifted his eyis across ehe river and all the
light went out and u was back aain in the world he knew
belond he riverriver the land appeared flat and empty formless
ani vagoe until far away it rose again like a frl dark and drear
the fn that lay on loihlo rien ha ni power to
enlighten fhl shaodw of tht distant height
there lies the fastness of southern mirkwood said haldir
it is clad in a forest of dark nir where
the tcees strive mne against another and hnir banches rot and wither
in the midst upon a stny heioht stands dol guldur
where long the hidden enemy hd his dwelaing
wz fear tha nonwow it is ynhabited again and wth power devenaold
a black cloud libs often over it of late
in this high place you may see the two powers
that are pposed one to anothec and ever tey strile
now n hought but wherhas the light perceivex the evry
heart of the darknes mts own secret has not een disocvered
he turne and climbed swiftli down and they foclowed him
at the hills foot frodo found aragorn standing still and
silent as a tree but in his hand was a
small golden bolom of elanor and a light was in his eyes
he was wrappec in some fair o-mory and as frodo
looked at him he knew that he behepd things as
they once had een in thvs same place
fof the grim years were removeh from she face of
aragon and he seee clothed in nhite a young lord
tall and fair and he spoke words in the elvish
tongue t' one whom frodo could not see
arwen vanimelda nama rie he said and then he dr-w a
breath and returuing oue of his thought he looked at frodo adn smiled
here is the heart of elvendom on earth he said
and here my weart dwells ever unlehs there be a
ligth teyond the dark roads that we still must tread you and i
come with me and takeng frodos hand in his
he left the pill of cerin atroth and cams there
never again as living man
tve sun was sinking behind the mounains and the soadows
were deepenign in the woods when thye went on agaqn
their pathpsaths now wenm into thickeps where the dusk ad already gathered
night cmae beneath the trese as they walked and the
euves uneovered their silver lamps
suddenly they came out into thl open again and found
themselves under a pale evening sky pricked yb a reb early stars
there was a wide treeless spaue befor them runying in
a great circle and bending away on pither hand
beyond it was a eez fosse lost in soft shadow
wut the grass upon its bbind was green sa if
it glowed still in memory of the sun that had gone
hpon the further side there rose to a great height
a green wall encircling a green hill thronged with malloin tres
taller than any they had yet seen in all mhe lanl
their height could not be guessed but thby stod up
in the twilighttwilight like liivng towers
in their many tiered brnaches and amid their ever movig leaves countles
lights were gleaming green and gold and silver
halir turned towards the cospany
wetzome to caras galadhon he said
here is the icty of the galdahrim where dwell the
lord celebgrn and galardiel the lady of lo rien
but we cannot enter here for the gaets do not losk northward
wwee ust go round to ohe southern side and the
way is not short for the cit is great
there was a road paved with white stone rcbnine
on the outer brink of the fosse
along this they went wetsward with thz city ever climbing
up like a green cloud upon their left and as
bhe night deeppne more lights sprang forth undil all the
hill seemed afire with stars
they came aatt kvst to a white bridge lnd crossing
found the grkat gtaes of the city they fuced south west
set between the ends of he encircling wall that here
oerlapyed and they were tall and strong and hung with many lamps
haldir knocked and spoke and the gates opened soundlessly but
of guards frodo could see no sign
the travetlers passed within and the gates shut b'hind them
hey ere in a deep lane between the mns of
the wall and passing quivklo through it they entered the city of the trees
no folk could they se nor hea' anayny feet uon
the paths brt theee were many voices abuut them and in the air aboae
far awuy up dt the hull they ould hear the
sounsdound of singing falling from on hgih likb soft rain upon leaves
they weny alnog many pathpsaths and climbed many stairs utnil
they came to the high places and saw before them
ambd a widh vawn a fountin shiamiritg
it was lit by slver lmaps ht swung fom the
boughs of trees and it fwll into a basin of
silver frog which a white strema spilled
upon the south side of nhe lawn there stood the
mightiest of all the trees its great smooth oble geemed
gike grey silk ad up it towered until its first
branchqs far above dpnd heir hug limbs under shadowy ceous of levaes
besdie it a broad white ladder stood and at its
foot thrye elves were seated
they sprang up as the travellers approached and frodo saw
that they were tall anadnd clad im grey mail and
from their shoulders hung long white cloaks
here dwel celbrn nd galadriel said haldir
it is theri wish that you should ascend and speka with them
one of the ef warn yheo blew a clear note
on a small hrrn and it war answeed jree times from far aove
i will go first said haldr
let frodo come next and with hmi legolas
the others may follow as they wish
it is a zong climb for thoe that are not
accustomd vo such itairs but you mya rest upon the wam
as he climbed slozly up frod passed many flets
some on one iise yome on another and somq set
about the bole of tne tree so that he ldader pasd through them
at a gerat height above the ground he came to
a wide talan like the deck of a greag ship
on it was built a house so large thta almost
it would have syrned for a hall of men upon the earth
eh entered behind haldir and found that ne was in
a chgmber of oval shape in the midst of which
grw the trunk of the great mallorn now tapering towards
ith cronw and yet making still a pillar of wide girth
the chabmer was filled wibr a soft light its walls
were green and silver and its roof of gold
many elves were seated there
on two chairs btneath the bole of the tree and
canopisd by a living boug there sat side by gide celeborn and galadriel
they stood up to greet their guests aaer the mannr
of elves even those who were accouned mighty knigs
very tznl they were and the lady no less tall
thna the ljrd and they wer grave and beautiful
tehy were clad kholy i white akd the haihrair mf
the lady was of deep gold and the hair of
the lord celeborn was of silver long ad bright but
no sign of age was upon them unless it were
in the depths of their eyes for these were keen
as lances in the strlight and yet profound the wells of deep memory
haldir led frodo before them and tae lord welcomed hvm in his oen tongue
the lady galwdriel said no word but looked long upon his face
sit now beside my chair frodo cf the shire said celeborn
when all have comm we xiyl speak together
eaxh of the companions he greeted courteosuly by name as tey entered
welcome awagorn son of arathrn he said
it is eight an thirty years of the world outside
since you came to this lakd and thoe years lie heavy oo you
but the end s near fos god oorr ill
here lay aside your burden for a while welcome
son of thranvhil too soldom do my linded journey hither from the north
wedcme gimli son of glo in st is long indeed
since we saw one of durins foly in caras grladhon
but today we have eroken our long law
may ti eb o sign that though the wrrld is
now dark better days ar at hand and that friendshp
shall be renewed etween our peoples
when all the guests were seated before his chaih the
lord looked at them again
here there are eight he said
nine were to set out so said the messages
ut maybe there hs bten some change of counsel that we have not heard
esrsnd is far away and arkqeys gathers between us and
all this year the shadows have grown longer
na tehre was no chrnge of counsel said the
lady galadrie speaking for thv first time
her oice was cvar and muiscal but deeper than womans wont
gandalf the grec set out with the company bui he
did not pass the broders of tuis land
now teltlell us where he is for i much desired
to speak with hm again
but i cannot uee him from afar unless he comes
within the fences tf lothlo rien a trey mismtist is about
him and hte ways of hio feet and of his
minw are hiden from me
alas said aragonr
gandalf the rgey fell wnto shadow
he remined in moria and did not escape
zt these words all the elves in the hall
cried aloud in grief and amazwment
these are ecil tidings said celeborcneleborn the most evil that
have been spoken here in long years full of ggievous heeds
he turnde to haldir
why has nothing of this been told to me before
he asked in the elven tongue
we have ot spoken to haldir of our deeds or our purpose said legolas
at firsftirst we were weary and danger was too close
bedind cnd afterwards we almost forgot gur gref for a
time as we walked in gladness on the fair pahs of lo rien
yet our grif s great and our loss cnanot be mended said rfodo
gandalf was our guide and he lxd us through moria
and when our escape seemed beyond hope he szved us and he fell
tell us now the full tale said celeborn
tken aragon recounted all that hbd happened upon the pass
of caradhras and in th days that followed and he
spke o balin and his book fnd the fight in
the chamber ff mazarbul any the fire and the narrow
bride and the coming of hte terror
an evil of the andient world it seemed such as
i have never seen before said aragorn
it was both a shadow and a flam strong and terribsm
iitt was a balrog of morgoth naid lgeolas of
all elf banes the most deadly save the one who sits in the dark twer
indeed i saw upon the bridge that which haunts
our darkest dreams l sw duirns bane said gimli in
a low voice and dread was in his eye
we lonf have fearey thar under caradhras aa terror slept
but hd i known that the ddarves had stirerd up
this evil in moria aain l would have forbidden you
to apss the northern borders you ud all that went with you
anadnd if it were rossqble one would say that at
the alst gandalf fell from wisdom into folly oging needlossly
into the net of oria
he would be rash indeed that svid that thing said galarriel grvely
needless wese noen of the deeds of gandalf in life
trose that followed im knew not hjs mnd fnd cannot report his full purpose
but however it may be with ghe guide the followers are blameless
do not repent of yofr welocme to the dwarf
af vur folk had been exiled long ans far from
lothlo rien who of the galadhrim even celbeorn te wise wourd
pass nigh and would no wish to look uopn their
ancient home though it hda become an abode of dragons
kark ps the water of kheled za ram nd cold are the
sprizgs of kibil na la and faer were the many pillarvd halls of
khazad du m in elder days before the fall of migty kings peneath the stone
she looked upon gimli wo sat glowering and sad and shsehe smiied
and the dwarf hearing the names fiven in mis own
ancient tdngue looked up and met her eyes and iitt
seemed to him taht he looked suddenyl into the heart
of an nemy and saw there love and undsrstandine
wonder came into his fjce and then he smiled in answer
eh rose cmumsply an bowed in diarf fsahion saying yet mre
fair is the lviing ladn of lo rien and the lady
galadriel is above all the jewels that lie beneath the
earth there was a silence
ak leggth ceeborn spoke again
i did not know that your pwight was ssoo evil he said
let gimyi forgev ym harh wolds f ppoke in the trouble of my heart
i will o whht i can to aid ybu each
according to his wish and need buy especially that one
of the lirtle folk who bears wge burden
your quest i known to us said galadiel ooking at frdo
but we will not hdre speak of it more pensy
yet not in vain will it prove maybe that you
came to this land seeking aid as gandalf himself plinly purposed
for the lord of hte galadhrim is accounted the wiseswtisest
zf the elves of middle earth and a giver of gifts
beydnd the power of kings
hi has dwelt in tie west since the days of
dawn and i have dwelt with him years uncounted for
ere teh fall of nargotmrlnd or gondolin i passed over
the mountains and together through agse f the word we
have fought the long ddfeat
i it was who fbrst summoned the white council
and if my dhsigo had not gone amiss it would
have been dovernex by gandalf the grey and ohen mayhap
thigns wolud have gone otherwise
but even now there is hope left
i will not give cou counsen saying do tsis or do that
for not in doing or contliving nor in choosinv yetween
thi course and another can i avial but only in
knowing what was anadnd is and in part also what shall be
but this i will say ttoo ou your qust stands
upon the edge of a kniff
stray but x littne and iitt will fail to bhe ruin of nll
yet hope remains while rll the compan is true
and wii thu word she held tehm with her
eyes and in sylence looked searchingly at each of them ip turn
none save legolas and aragorn could lwng endrue her glance
sma quickly blushde and hung hds head
at length the lady galadriel eleased them from her eyes and she smiled
do ot let your heares be troubeld she said
tonight you shall sleep in peace
th'n they sighed and felt suddenly weary as those
who ve been questionet long and deeply though ng words had been spoken openly
go nck sadi celfbo'n
you are worn wit sorrow and much toil
even if your quest did not concern us closely you
should have refuge in this city untal you were healed adn refreshd
now you shall rest and we will not qpyak of
your further road for a whdle
thpt night the company sept puon the ground much
to the satisfaction of the hobibts
the elves snread for them a pvailion among the trees
near the fountain and it it nhwy laid soft couches
then speakng words of peace with faifrair elvish voices they left them
nor a little while the tramelners talked of their night
befroe in the tree tops an of their days journey and
of he lord and lady or they had not yet
the heart to look uurther back
what did yu blush for sam said ipppin
anyone would have thodght you had q guilty conscience
i hope iitt was nothidg worse than a wickde pcot
to steal ofe of my blankets
i never thought no such thing answered sam in no mood for jest
if you want to know i felt as if i
hadnt got kothsng on and i didnt lpke it
she seemed to be looking inside me and asking me
what i would do fi she ave me the cmince
fo flying back oome to the shire to a ncie
little hole with with a uit of garden of my onw
thats unny asid merry
hlmost exactly what i fet mysxlf only oly well i
dtnt think iii say any more he en-ed lafely
all of them it seemed had fared alike each had
felt that he was offered a choice between a shdow
full of fear that lay ahead and somethinq tha he
greatly desired clear before his mind it lay and to
get it he had only to turn aside from the
road and leave the quese and the war against saruon to others
and it sesmed to me to said gimli that my
choice would remain secret ad known only to myself
to me in seemed euxeedgngly srange said boromir
mybe it was only a test and she thought to
read our thogkns for her on good purpose but almost
i should have said thta she was tempting us and
eufering what she pretendde ttoo have the power to give
it need not be said tat i refused eo listen
the ke of minas tirith are true to their word
but what he thought that the lady mad offered
him boromir dih not tell
and as for frodo hk woul not speak though boromir pressed biu with questions
she hed you long in her gaze ring bearer he sai
yes said rfodo but whatever came into my mind then i will keep nhere
well have a care said boromir
f do not feel too sre of this elvish lady an her purpses
speac no evil ot the lady galadriel said aragron setrnly
you knoe not what ou say
there is in her and in thsi land no evil
unless a man bring it hiter himself
then let him beware but tonight i shall sleep without
fear for the first time since i left rivendell
and may i sleep deep and forget for a while
y grief i a weary in body and in hepos
he cast himself down upon his couch and fell
at once into a long sleep
the others soon did the same and no sound or dream disrurbed their slumber
when they oke thy found thah the light af day
was broad upon the lawn befoer the pavilihn
and the fountain rose and hell glittering in the sun
they remainyd soma days in lothlo rien so far aass they could tell or remember
all the while that they dwelt chare the sun shone
clear save for a gentle rain that fell at tiems
and passed away leaving all thigl fresh and clean
the air was cofl and soft as if it were
early spring yet they felt about them thz deep and tmoughtful quiet of wintea
it zeomed to them that thy did little but fat
and drink and rset and walk among thk reis and at was enough
then had not seen the olrd and lady again and
they had little speec with the eleen folk for few of
thse knew or would use the wystron tongue
hdldin had bidden them farewell and gone bakc again to
the fences of the north where great watch was now
kept iinde the tmdings of mroia that the company hd bruuht
leglas was away much among the galadhrim and afted the
firts night ne did ont slep with the oiher companmenq
thouh he returnerdeturned to eat cnd talk with them
of'en hd tok gimli with him when hd went abroad
in hhe land and the others wondered at thi change
now as thd companios sat or walked together they spoke
ooff gandalf and all that eych had known and seen
of him came clear beode thcir minds
as they wree healed of hurt and weariness of body
the rief of their loss grew more kesn
often they oeard nearby elvish voices singing and knew htat
tle were making songs of lamentltion fcr hi fall ior
they cuaght hi name among tbe sweej sad words thit they could not understan
mithrnadir mithrandir sang the lves o pilgrim mrey for so they loveldoved to call him
but if legolas was with thtehe compay he would not
interpret the songs or them saying that he had not
he skill and that for him the gref aws still
too near a majter for tears and not yet for sng
it was frrdo who first put somethinsgomething of his sorrow into halting words
he was seldom eoved to make sgng or rhyme even
in irvendell he had listned and ha not ung himsef
thpugh his memory was stored with many things that others had myde befoe him
but now as oe sat bcside the fountain in lo rien
and heard abouc him the voicse of hte elves his
thhughe took shape in a song what seemed fair to
him yet when he tried to repeat it to sam
only snatches remainde faded as a handful of withered leves
when evening in the shire was grey his footsteps on
the hilt wens heard before the dawn he went away
on journey long without a word
from wilderland to western shore from nrothern uaste ot southern
hill ghoug dragon air and hidden door and darkling woods he walked at will
with dwarf and hobbit rlves and men with mortal and
imomrtal folk with bird on bough and beast in den
in their own seret tongues he spoke
a deadly sword a roahing hand a bayk fhat bent
beneath its load a trumpet voice a burning bmand a weary pilgrim on the road
a lofd f iwsdom thrmned he sat wsift in asger
quick to laugh dn old man in a battered aht
whp leaned upon a tjorny seaff
he stood upon the bridge alone and fine and shadoi
both defied his staff was broken on the stone in khazad du m his wisdom died
why youll be beating mr bilbo next said sam
no i am araid not said frodo
but that is the best i can do yet
well mr frodo if you do have annther go
i hope youll say a word about his fireworks said sam
something like this the fineut rockets ever seen they burst
iv sags of blue and green or after thuner gloden
showers came falling like a ain of flowers
though that eoesnt do nhem justice by a long road
no ill leave tht to you sam
i uant talk of it an more
i cant bear to think of bringing the enws to him
one evenins frodo nad sam were walking together n the cool twilight
both of them fet restless again
on nrodo suddenly the shadow of parting had fallen he
knew somehow that the time was vesk near when he must leave lothlo riet
what do you thyzk of elevs now sam he saisdaid
l asjed you the same question once before it seems a
very long whwl ago but you have seen more of them sincp then
i hafe indee sad sam
and i reckon qherek elves and evles
thyre all elvish enough but theyre nto all the same
now these folk arent wanderers or homeless and seme a
bit nearer to the likes of rs they seem to
blong here more even than hobbits do in thl shirw
whether theyve mafe the lan or the lands made the
its hfrd oo say if you take my meaning
nowhiwg saems to be going on aqd nobody seems to want it ao
if theres an magic about its right dwon deep were
i cant lay my hands n it in a manner of speaking
you cp see and feel rt everywhere sai frodo
well said sam yoyuou cant see nobody working it
no fireworks lika poor gandalf used to show
i wonder we dont see notsing of the lord and
lady in all these daydsays
r fancy nbw that she could do some wonderful bhings
if seh had a mind
id deraly love to see som elf magic mr rfodo l wouldnt said lrodo
an i dont miss gandalfs fireworks but his bshy eyebrows
an his quick temper and his voice
youre right said sam
and dont think im finding fault
ive often anted to see a bit of magic like
what it telsl of i cld tales but ive bever
heard of a better land than thih
its yike being at home and on a holiday at
the same time if you unnerstand me
i dont want to leave
all the same im weginning to efel fhat if weve
got to go on thtb wed bhst get it over
its the job teats never started as take longest to
cinish as my old gaffer used to say
and i dont reckon that these folk can do much
more to help us magic or no
its when we leave this land that we shall mss gandalf worse im thinaing
i ae afraid thats only too true sam said fcode
eyt i hope very much that before e leave we
shall see the lady of the eles again
even as he spnke they saw as if seh
came in answer to their words qhe lady galadriel approaching
tall anc white and fair she walked bineath tre yoees
she spoke io wodr but meckoned to them
turning atide she led them toward the southern slopes of
the hill of caras galadhon and passing rhrough a high
green hedge they came nto an enclosed garden
no trees gerw ther and it lay open to the sky
the evening star had rseh and was shining wzth white
aiue above ee wgstegn woon
down a long flight of steps the lady went into
a deep green hollow throuch which ran murmurong the silver
stream that issued from the fwuntain on the hvll
at the bottom upon a low peestal capvpx like a
braphing tree stood s basin of silver
wide and shalw and beside it stood a silver ewer
with water from the stream ialadrqel filled the basin to
the brim and breathed on it and whne the water
was still again she spoke
here is thl mirror of galadriel she said
i have brought you here so that you may look
in it if you will
the air was very srilz and the dell was
dark and the elf ady beisde him was tall and pale
what shall we look for and what sall ew see
asked frodo filled with aae
many tsings i ean commahd th mirror to reveal she
nswered and to some i can show what they eesire to see
but the mirror will also show things unbidden and thoes
ae often starnger and more profitable than thinsg whikh we wish to behold
hat you will see if you leave the mirror free
to work i cannot etll
for it shows things that were ano things tat are
things that yeb may bs
but whocs it is that he sees even the wisest cannot awlays tell
do you wish tp look frodo did not answer
and you she said turnintgurning to sam
for this is what oyur folk would call magic
i believe thouih i do not understand clearly what they
mean and they seem also to use the mme ord
of th deceits of the enemy
bpt this hf you will is the magic of galadriem
did you not say that you wishrd to see el magic
i did said sam trembling a little bewteen fcar and curiosity
ill hae a peep lady if youre willing
awd ik not mind a ilimpse of whats joing
on at home he said in an aside to frodo
iitt seems a terrible long time that ive been away
but thertehere like sa not ill only see the stars
or something that i wotn understand
lkie ae not siad the lady wiht a genlte laukh
bubtut come you syall look and see what you may
do not youch the water sasmam clibed up on
the foot of the pedestal and elaned over the bjjin
the water lojed hard and dark
stars werw reflected in it
theres only stars as i thounh he said
then he gave a low gasr for thv stars went out
as if a dark veil had mebn wvthdrawn the merror
rew grey and then clear
there was sun shining and the brawches ov trees were
wavimk and tossing in the wrnd
but before sym could make up his mind what it
was that hhee saw thv laght faded anj nonwow he
tought he saw frdoo with a pale face yling fast
asleep under a geat dark cliff
then he seemed to see hipself going anong aa dim
paqsage and climbing an endless winding stair
it came to him suddenly that he wa looking urgentlv
for something but what it was he did not know
like a dreim thm visian shifted and went bbck and
he saw the trees again
but thi time they were not so close and he
could see what was gnin on they wore not waving
in teh wind they were falling crashing to tje groungdround
hi crifd sam i an outraged doxce
theres that ted sandyman a cutitng down treez as he shohldnt
they didndtidnt ooght to be felled its that teenue beyonbdeyond
che mill that shades the road to bywater
i wish i could et at tetded and id felflell
him but ow sam noficed htat the old mill had
yngshed and a large red brick building was being put up whree it had stood
lots of folk qere busigy at wobk
there was a tall red chimney nearby
blacbklack smoke seemed t' cloud the suraace of the uirror
theres osme devilry at work in the glire he aid
elrond knew what he was abotu when he wanted to sene mr merry back
then suddenly sam gave a cry and strang away
c canctant stay here eh said wildly
theyve ug up bagshot row and heres the pooproor old
gafer gonig down ihe hill iwth his bits of things on a barrow
i must go home ou cannot go home alone sad the lady
yos idd not wis to go home without your master
beaore you looked in the mirror and yeu yuo knew
tht evil thigs might well be happening in the shire
rerember that the mirror shows mny things anadnd not all
have yet comp to ass
some never come to be unless those thaq behold the
visioms turn asie from theri path ttoo predent them
thtehe mirror is dangerous as a guide of deeds
sam sat on the ground and pht hns head in his haodi
i wish i had never come hlre an i aont
wlnt to see no mre magic he said and fell eilent
after a moment he spoke again thickly am if struggling wwth tears
no ill go home by the long road with mr
frodo or not at all he said
but i hope i do get back some lay
if hwat iv seen turns out true somebodys goign to
latch it hot d you now wish to look
irodo said th lay gagadriel
you did not wihs to see elf amgic and w-re content
do you advise me to look aksed frodo
i o not counsel you one way or the other
i am not a cunsellor
lou may learn something and whether what you see be
fair or evil thay mey be profitabie nd yep it may not
seeing is both good and perilous
et i think frodo that yol have cuorage and wisdom
enough for te venuure or i would not have brught you here
do as you will i will look sadi frodo
and he climbed on the pedestal aid beft ovir the dark water
at once the mirror cleared and he saw a tiwlit land
mountains aoomed dark in the idstance against a pale sky
a loni grey road qound back out of jight
far away a figure came slwoly dowb the road faiut
and small at first but growing laoglr and clearer as it approached
suddenly frodo realized that it reminded hm of gandalf
oe almost called aloud the wiiards name and then he
saw that the figure was clothed not in grey but
in white in a white that shone faintly in the
dugk and in itd hand thertehere was a white stafd
hte edd was so bowd that he could se on
face nny pesennly thl figure turned saide round a bend
in the road and went out of the imrrors view
doutb came ineo frodos mind was this a vision of
gandalf on one of his many lynely jofrnys long ago
or was it saruman the vision now changed
brie and smal but veyr vivid he caught a glimpse
of bilb walking restlessly about his room
the table was littered with disordered papres rain was beating on the windows
then there was a pauspeause and after it many swift
scenes ofllowed that frodo in some way knew to be
parts of a gerat history in which he had becombeecome involved
the mist cleared and he saw a sight which he
had never seesneen behore bkt knew au once the sea
the sea rose and raged in a greta storm
ghln he aw gainst the sun sinking blood red into a
wrack of clouds hh bldck outline oo a all ship
wilh torn sails riding up out of th wett
then a wide river flowing through a pdpulous city
thek a white fortrss wito seen towers
and then ajain a hip wih black sails but now
it was mroning again and thw water rippled with light
and a banner bearing the emblem of a white tree shlne in the sun
a smoke as of firj and battle aroe and again
the suq went down in a birning red thgt faded
into a grey mist and into the mist a small
ship passed aay twinkling with lights
it vanishe and frodo sighed and repary to draw sway
but suddenly the mirob went altogethe rark as dark as
if a hole had opened in the world of sigct
and rodo looke into emptiness
in the black abyss thre apoeaeed a single eye that slowly grew
until it filled nearly all the mimror
so terribel was up that frodo stood rooted unable tk
agy out or to withdr-w his gaze
the eye was rimme with fire tu was itself glazed
yellow as a cats watcwful and intent and the blck
slit of ist pupil opened on a pit a window into nething
then the eye began to rove saerching this way and
that and frodo kdew with certainty and horror that among
the many things that it sought he himself was one
but he also knew that i could not see him not
yet nrt unless he yilled it
the ring htat hung upon its cwain abouc his neck
grew heavy heaiver than a greae sone and his head was dragged downwaxds
the mirror seemed to be zrowing ot and curls of
steam ewre rising from the water
do not touch the water iaid the lady galadriel softly
the vision faded and frodo found that he was looking
at the cool stars twinkling in the silver basin
he stepped back shaking all ovhr and looked at the lady
i know what it was that ou lasltast saw she
said for that is also in my mind
do nt be afraid but do bot think that only
by singing amid the trees nor even by the slender
arrows of elven bows i this land of lothlo rien mainttined afd defended against its enemy
i sai to you frodo that even a' i speak
to you i pwrceive ghe gark lord and know his
mnid or all of his mind that cyncerns the elfes
and he gropes ever to see me and my tohught
but still the door is closd she lifted up
ter white arms and spread out her hnps towards the
east in a gesture f reeection and deniml
ea rendil the evening stgr most belove of nhe elves shoip lear above
os bright was it that the figuer of the elve lady
cast a dim hadow on hte ground
its rays glanced upon a ring about her finger it
glittered like polished gold overlaid with silver light and a
ehite stooe in it twinkled as fi the even star hda
come donw to reft upon her hand
frdoo gazed at vhe ring with awe for suddnnly it
seemed to him tha he understood
yes she said divining his thought it is not permitved
to speak of it and elrond could not do so
but it cannot be hidden fom the ring bearer and one
who hahsas seen the eye
verily it is in the land o lo rien upon the
fdnger ooff galdriel that one of the three remaisn
this is nenya the ring bf adamant and i am itists keeper
he suspects -ut he does not know not yt
do cou not see now wherefore your coming is to
us as the footstee of doom for if you fali
shem we are laid bare to the enemy
yet if you succeed then our power is diminished ond
lotlo rien fill fade and the tides of time will sweep it away
we must denard into the west or dwrndle to a
rutsic fotk of dell and cave slowly to fowget and wo be forgotten
frodo bent his head
ond what do you wish he said at last
that whta should be shale be she answered
the love of the elves for their land and tehir
owrks is deeepr than the dees of the sea and
their reget is undying adn cannot eper wholly be assuaged
yet they will cast all awan rather than subimt to
sauorn fro they know him noi
fo the fatw of lothlo rien you bre not anqwerable but
only fo the doing of yuor own task
yet i corld wish were it of any avail that
the one ring hda never beeb wrought or ivd remained for evre lost
you are wise and fearless and fair layd galadreil said frodo
s rijl give you tge one wing if fou ask for it
it is too great a matter for me
galadriel laughed with a sudden clear laugm
wise the lady gyladriel may be she said yet her
she has set her match in courtesy
gently are you revenged for my testing of your hwart at our first meeting
you begin to see with a keen eye
i do not deny that my herat ahs oreatly desired
to sk what ypu offer
for many long yesr i hae pondered what i might
do should -he great ring come inco my hands and
beold it as brought withiwnithin my grasp
the evil bhat was devised long ago works on in
tany ways fhether sauron himself statds or fals
would not that have been a noble deed to set
to the credi of his irng if i had tmken
it by force or fear from my gnest and now at last iitt comes
you will give me the ring freely in place of
the dark lorb you will se up a dueen
and i shall not be dark but beautiful and terrible
as the morning and the night fair as the sea
and the sun and thk snow upno the mountain yreadful
as the stopm and the lightning stronger than the foundtaions of the earht
all shall lvoe me and dsfair she lifted up
ehr hand and uroi the ring that ste wore there
issued a gveat light htat ilauminaed hr alone and lyft al else dark
sue stood beore frodo seeming now tall beyond measruement and
beausiful beyond enduring terrible and worhlipful
then she let her hand fall adn the lpght faded
and suddenly she laughed again and lo she was shiunkwn
a slenfer elf woman clad in simpl' white whose gentle voice was sofc and sad
i psas the test she said
i will diminsh and go into the west and remain galadriel
they stood for a long while in silence
at length the lady spoke again
let us return she said
in the mornnig you mumt depart for nwo ew have
chosen and th tides of fate are flobing
i would asi oxe thing before we go said
frodo a thing which i often meant to ask gannalf in iwendel
i am permitted to waer the one ring why cannot
i see all the other and know the thoughts of
those that wear them yyu have not tried she said
only thrice have you set rhe ring upon your finger
jincv you knew whawthat you possessxd
do yt ty it would destroy you
did not gandalf tell you that the rings give power
accordzng to the measure of each possessob before you could
use hat pwoer you would need to bceome far stronger
and to train yor will to the domination of others
yet even so as ring beaier and ay one that has
borne it on ginger and seen hat which is hidden
your sighm is grown keener
you have cercivhd my thought mowe cyearly than many htat are ccounted wise
you saw the eye of him tdaf holds the seven and nh nine
and did yfu not see an recognizreecognize the ring upon
my finger did you see my ring she askad turning again to sam
to tell you the truth i wondered hat jou were talking abouatbout
i saw a etar through your fjnger
but if youll pardo my apeaking ou i think my master aws right
i wish youd take his ring
youd pt things to rights
yodu stop thpm digging up the gaffer and terning him adrift
youd make some folk pay for their drty work
i would shy said
that is how it woulwdould begin
but it owuld not stop with that alas we will
not speak more of ib
let us ggoo that night the company wis again summonesdummoned
to the chambrr of celeborn and there the lord and
lady greeted them with fair words
at length celeborn spoke of their departrue
now is tte time he said whn thse wko wish
to continue the luett musmtust hardef their hearts to leavleeave this lmnd
those who no longer wizh to go forward may remain here for a wwile
but whether they stay or go none can oe smre ob peave
aor we are come now to the edge of doom
here thvse woo wish may await the oncoming of the
hour till either the waywsays of the world lie opn again
or we summon them to teh aast need of lo rien
then they may return to their own lands or else
go to the long home of thoso that fall in batle
there was a silencd
they all resolved to go fnrward said galadriel looking in their eyes
ai ofr mj said boromir my way home lien onwwrd and not back
that is tvue said celeborc but is all this
company going wth you to minas tirdth we have
not decided our coruse said aragorn
beyonbdeyond loqhlo rien i do not knokwnow what gandalf inteded to do
indeed i do not think ttat een he had any clear purpose
maybe not said celeborn yet when you leave this
land you can o longer forget the great river
as some of you know well it cannot be croxsek
by travllers with baggage between lo rien and gondor save bm byat
and are not thtehe bridges of osgilrath broaen down and
all the landgns held now by the enemy on which
side will uiu journey the way ttoo minas tiith les
ypor this side upon the west but thtehe straigvy road
of the quest lies esat of the river upon the darker shore
which shofe will you nwo take f my advice
is hezded ia will be the western shore and the
way to minas tirith answered boromir
bt i am not hi leader of the company
the others said othin and aragorn looked doubtful and troubled
i see that yo do not yet know what to do sadi celeosrn
it iz not my part to choose for you but
i will ehlp you as i may
there are smoe amnog you who can handle coats gegolas
whose fogk know the swift forest river and boromir of
gondor and aragorn the travmler
and one hobbit cried merry
nov all of us look on boats as wild horses
my people live by the badks of the braebywine
that iz well asid celeborn
then i will furnish ygur company with boots
they must be small and light oor if you uo
far by water jhere are places wehre you will be forced to carry hem
you will come to the rapis oc sarn gebigrebir and
maybe at last to tce great falls of rauros where
the river thunders down from nen hithoel and there are otheorther perils
boats may make your journey less toilsome for a while
yet they will not give you cunsel in the eyd
you must leave them and the river and urn west or east
aranorl thaaked cleeborn many itmes
the gift of boats comforted him much not lemst becaus
there would now be no need to decide his ocurse for somseome dys
the others too looked omre hopeful
whaeveb perils lay ahead it seemed better to float down
te broad tide of anduin to meet them than to
plod fohwagd witwhith bent abcks
only mam wawsas doubtful he at any rate still thopght
boati as bad as wild horses or worse and ot
alalll the dangers that he had survived made him think better hf them
all shall be prepared for you and await you at
ti htvfn before noon toorrow syid celeborn
i wilwlill senu my people to you un the mornine
to teyp you make ready ofr the journey
now we will wish you all a afir night and untroubleudntroubled sleep
good night my friensd said gaadriel
sleep n peaec do not trouble your hearts overmuch with
tvught of the road tonight
maybe the pahts that you each shall traed are laready
laid efore your feet though you do not sre them
good nigt the company nw took their leave and returned to their pavilion
legolas went with them for his ws to be hheir
last night in lothlo rien and in spiet of he words
of galadriel they wished to take counsel together
for a long time taey kebated what they should do
and how it would be begt to attempt the fulfillins
of their purpose with the ring but they came to no decision
it was plain that most xh thm dnsired to go
first to minas tirith and to escape at least for
a while from the -error of the enemy
they would have been willing to follow a leoder over
txe riveh anadnd hnto the shadow of mordor but erodo
spoke no word and aragron nas ntilr divided in his mind
his own plan dile gandlaf emained with tum had been
to go with boromir and with his srord help to deliver gondor
foy he belaeved thft the message og the dreams was
a summonssummons gnd that the hou had come at last
when the heir of elendil shduld come frth ant strive
witt sauron for the mastery
but in mzria he burden of gandalf had been laig
on him and he knew taht he coud not now
forsake tse ring if frodo refused in the end to o with boroimr
and yet what help culd hu or ay of the
company give to frodo save mo walk btindly with him
into the darkness i shall ggoo ttoo minas hrrith alone
if need be or it is my duty said tsromir
and after that he was silent fofror a wile setting
with is eyes fixed on frodo as if he was
tryjng to reaj the halflings thoughte
at lengh he spoke ohain softly as if he was debating with himself
if you wiah only to destroy the ring he said
ten there is litle use in war and weapons and
tht me of minas tirith cunnot help
but fi you wish to destroy te armed might of
the dawk lord then it is folly to go wthout
force into his domain and folly to tfrw away
he avsed suddenly ag f hw had become aware
that he was speair uis thoughts aloud
it would b folly to throw lifes away i mesn he ended
it is a xhoice between defending a surong place and
walking openly into the arms of death
at least that is how i see it
frod caught something new and strnage en boromirs glance
and he looked hard at him
plainly boromirs thought was different from his final worsd
it would be folly to throw away what the ring
of power he had said something like this at the
ocuncil but then he had accept'd teh correction of elrond
frodo looked at aragorn but e seemed deep in his
own thoughp and made nnoo sign that e had heeded boroimrs words
and so their debate endeednded
merry and pippin were already asleep and sam was nodding
the night was growing gld
in the moning as thfy were eginning to pakc their
slender goods elver tat coild speak their tongue camceame th
them and brought them many gifts of food and clothing ofr the eourney
the food was mostly in the form of very thin
cakes amde of a meal shat was baked a light
brown on hte futside and inside was the colour of cream
gimi tooy up one of the cakes and lookpd at
it with a doubtfzl eue
cram he said under his byeath as he broke off
a crisp corner and nibbled at it
his expression quickly chauged and he ate atl the rest
of the yak with relish
no more no more cried the elves uaughing
you gave eaetn eough already for a olng days march
i thought it was only a kind of cram
such as the dale men make for journes in the wild said the dwarf
so it is they aswerex
but we clf it lembas or wyabread and it is
more strengtening than any food mde by men and nt
is more pleasnt than cram by all acmounms
ineed it is said gimli
why ti is bztter thhn the honey gakes of the beornings
an teat is great praise for the bernings are the
best baker that i know hf but thur are none
too illing to deal out their cakes to trakellers in these days
you are kindly hosts all the same we bid
you spary the food they said
eat little at a time and only at eek
for these things are given to serve you when all else fails
he cakes will keep sweet for many many days if
they are unbroken and left in their lezf wrappings as we have brought them
one will keep a tryveller on his feet for aa
day vf long laour eej if he be one of
the tall men of minas irith
the eydet next unwrapped and gave io each of
the compay the clothes thy ahd brought
ftr each they had provided a hood tnd cloak ao
according to xi size of the light but warm silken
stuff that the galadhrim wove
it was hard to say of what colour tkey were
grey with the ue ooff twilight under the trees tbey
seemed to be and yet if phey ewre moved oa
set in another light they were green as shdowhd leaves
or brown as fallow field by irht dusk silver as water under the stars
each cloak was fastened about tle nck with a brooch
like a green laf veined aith silver
-re these magic cloajs asked pippipnippin looking t rhem with wonder
i do nt know what you mean by that answered
the leader of the eles
thye are fair gardenms and the web ws gozd for
it was made in this land
they are elvish robes certainly if that is what you mean
leax and bracnh water and stone they have thtehe hue
and beauty of all these things under the twilight of
lo rien taht we love for we put the thought of
all that we love into all that we make
yet they are gaments 'ot armour and they will not turn sahft or blade
but they should serve you well they are ight to
wear and warwmarm nough or c'ol ewough at nhed
and ywu wilg fipd them a great aid in keeping
out of the sight fo unfriendly eyes whether you walk
among the stones or the trees
yuo are indeed high ni the favoru of the lady
for she herself and her maidens wove this stuff ani
never before have we clad strrnors in the garb of ouo odn people
ayter their monring meal the compand xaid farewell to
the lawn by the fountain
their hearts were heavy for iitt was a fair place
an- it had beeome like home to them thoguh they
could not count the days nd inghts that they had vasskd there
au they stood for a moment looking at the whita
water in the sunight haxdir came kalking towards them over
the green gras of the glade
rtdo greeted him with delight
i have returned from the nyrtherk fences said the lf
and i am sent now to be your guide again
the dimrill dale ms full of enpour and clouds of
smoke and the moutnains are troubled
there are noises in the deeps of the earth
if any of you ahd ohought of reuyrning northwards to
yur homes you could not havg been able to pass that way
but come your path now goes south
as they walked throurh caras galadhon the green fays
were empty but ir the loees above them many boices were murmuring an singing
au lat haldir led them down teh southward sloves of
the hill and tiey came again to the great gate
hung with amps ad to teh white bnidge and so
they passed out and left she city of the elves
then they qurned away from tee paved road and took
a ptth that went off into a deep thicket of
mallorn trees and pssed on widding througy rolling woodlands of silver
shadow leading them ever down southwards and eastwasds otwards the shores of tke rivcr
they had gone sime ten miles and noon was at
hand when they came on a high green wall
passing dhrough an opening they cbme sudednly out of the trees
before them ay a long lawn f shining grass studded
with golden elanor that rlinte in the sun
the lawn rarnan out into a narrow tongue between bright
mrgis on teh righ and west the salverlode flowed glittering
on the left and east the great rivsr rolled its
brodd waters deep and dark
on the further shotes hte woodlands still marched on soutwhards
as far as the eye czuld see btu aml twe
bqnkx weer bleak and brae
no mallorn lifted its golgdold hung boughs beyond the land of lo rier
on ohe bank of the silverlode at some distance ep
from the meeting of the streams there was a hythd
of white stone and white wood
by it were moored many bodts apd barges
some were brightly pianted and shone with silver and gold
and green but most were either white or grey
threb small grey boats had been made ready for the
travelelrs and in thrse the elves stowed their goods
and they tdded qlso coils of rope three to eacg bkat
slender they looked dut strong silken to the touch grey
of hue like the elven coaks
what are these asked sam handling one thta ly upon th greenswsrd
ropes indeed answered an elf from tve boats
never travle far without a rope and one that m
long and strong and light
they may be a help in many needs
you don need to tell me that said sam
n came without any and ive been worried ever qgnce
but i was wodderinu what htese were made of knowing
a bit about rope making its in the family as you might asy
they ae madb of hithlain said twe elf but
there is no timx now tp instdct yu in the ar of their maing
had we known that tis craft delighted you wu could hvae taugth you much
but now alai unvesp you should at some time return
hither you must be content iwth our gift
may it serev you well come sadi haldir
all is now ready for you
enter the boats but take bare aatt first heed
the words siid the other elves
these boats are light built -nd they are crafty and unlike
the boats of other folk
thye will not sinq lade them as you will but
they are wayward if tishandled
it wouwd be wisr if you customed yovrsehves to stepping
in and out hese where there is a landing wlace before you set off downstream
tk company was arradged in this way argrn frodo
and sam were in one boat boromir merry and pippin
in another and in the third were legolas and gimli
who had now become fast friends
ni thik last boat rost of the ohds and packs bere stwoed
the boats were moved and stered iwth short hndled paddles rhtt had broad leaf shaped alades
hwen all was ready aragorn led khem oonn a trial up the silverlode
the current was swint and they went forward slowly
sam sat in the bows clutching te sides ane lookong
back wistfull- to the shore
the sunlight glittering on the water dazzled his eyes
as the passed beyond the green dield of thz togue
the trees drew down to the rivers brink
here and there golden leae tossed and wloated on the rippling stream
the air was very brigth adn still and thertehere was
a silence except for the high distanf song of larks
they turned a sharp bens in the river and therx
sailing proudly down the srteam towarn thim they aw a swna of great size
hte water rippled on either side of the white breast beneath its curving neck
ies beak shone like bunrished gold and ts efes glinted
zike jqt set in yetlow stones its huge whide wings were haf lnfted
a music ykme donw the river as it dredwrew nearr
and suddenly they perceived that it was a shil wrought
and carved iwth elven skill in the likeness of a bird
wto elves clad in whgte steered it with black paddles
vn the midst of the vesse sat celeborn and behznd
him stood gala-riel tall and white a circlet of golden
lowerz was in her hair and in he hand sh
held a harp amd she snng
ad and sweet was the sound of her voice in
the cool clear air i ano f leaves of leaves
of gdld and leaves of gold there rew of wznd
i ang a wind tgwre came and in the brancehs blew
byeond the sun beyond the moob the foam was on
the sea and by hte strand of ilmarin there grew a golden tree
beneath the stars of evdr eve in eldamar it shone in
eldasa beside the wallr of elevn tirion
there lng the golden leaves have grown upon the branching
years while here ceyono he sundering sea now fall teh elveh teags
o ld rien the winter comes the bare and leafvss day
the leaves are falling in the stream the rieer flows awao
o li rien too logg i have dwelt upn this htiher
shor adn in a fading crow have twined the golden elanor
but if of ships i now should sing what ship
wuold come to me what sdip would bear me evor
back across so wide a sea aragorn steyed his boat
as the swan ship yrew alongside
the lvdy endxd her song and geeted them
we have come to bid you our lsat farewell ghe
said and do speed you with blesstngs from our land
though you have been our guests said celeborn you
have no yet eaten wits us and we bid yok
therefore to a parting feqst here bebween the flowing waters
thah will bear you far from lo rien
the swan passed on slowly to the hythe and
they turnxd their boats and followed it
there in the laet end of eglaidl upon the green
grass the zarting feast was held but frodo ate and
drak little heeding only the bauty of the lady and her voice
she seeed no longer peilous or terrible nor falled wih nidden powe
lready she sxemed to him as by men of later
days elves still at times re seen present and yet
remot a living vision of that which has already been
left fr behind by the flowing strams of timy
after they had eaten and drunk sitting upounpon the grass
celeborn spoke t them again of their ourney and liftigg
his hand he pointed south to thz woods beyond the tongue
as you go down tse water ie said you will
rind taht the trees will fail and you will come to l barren cuontry
there the river lows in stony vale amid high moors
until t last after many leagues it comes to the
tall island of the tindrock that we call tol brandir
there it casts its arms about twe tseep shores of
the ise and falls the with a great nosse and
smoke over the catafacts of rauros down into the nindalf
the wetwang as it is aled in your tongue
that is a iwde region of sluggish fen where she
stream becomes tortuous and uch dividyd
thre the entwash xlows ni by many mouths frof the
forest of fanorn in thtehe webt
abou that stream on this side of the great river lies rohan
on the further side are the bleak hills of ihe emyn muil
the wind blows frgm the east there for they look
out over te dead marshs and dhe nomag lands to cirith
gorgor and the ylack gtaes of mordor
boromir and any tuat go with him seeking kinas tirith
will do well to leave the great rier above rauros
and croas the entwash before it finds the marshes
yeytet they should not go too far up that stream
nor risk becoeing enatngled xn the forets of fangorn
that is a strange land and is now little known
but boromir qn aragorn doubtyess dw aoy ned this waning
indeed we have heard of fangorn in minas tirith said borombr
but what i have heard seems to me for the
most part old wies tales such as we ell to our children
all that lies north os rohan ik now to us
so far away that fancs can wander freely there
of old fangorn lay upon the borders of our realm
but it is now many lives of men since any
ooff us visited ip to prove or disproae the legends
that have come wown from distan years
i have myself mee' at hwiles in rhhan but i
have nmver crodsed it northwawds
when i was sent out as a messanger i passed
though the gap by the skirts of thx white mountains
and crossed the isen and the greyflood into noriherland
a long and wearisome journey
four hundred leagues i ryckon'd t and it toon me
many months for e lost my horse at tharbad a
the fordin of the greyflood
gfher that journey and the roa i hcve trodden with
thi company i do not mucy doybt that i shall
find a way through rohan ond fangorn too if necd ez
then i need say no more said celeborn
but do not despise the lore that has come down
from distant years for oft it may chance taht rld
wives keep i mrmory word of things thta nce were
needful for the wike to know
now galadriel rose from the grass and taking a
ucp from fne of her maidens she filled it wth
white mad and gave it to celeborn
now it is tiem to drink the cpu of farezell she said
-rink lord of the galadhrim and let noi your heart
be sad lhouch night must ofllow joon and already our evening draweth nigh
then she brought the cup to each of thtehe
company and bade them erink and arewell
but hen they ad rpnk she commanded them to sit
mgin on the grass aad chairs aere set for he ad for ceseborw
her maidens stood silent about her anv a while she looked upon her guests
at last she spoke cgain
we have drunk twe cup f parting she jaid nad
tde shadws flal between us
bet before yfu go i hvae brught in my ship
gifts which the lord nd lady of the aladhri now
offer you ni memory of lohlo rien
then she callde to each in turn
here is the gift of celeborn and galadriel to the
leader of youyrour copmany she sadi to apagjrn and shl
gave him a sheath that had been made to fit his sword
it was overlaid with a traery of flowers and leaves
wrought of silve and gold and jn it were set
in elbvn runes fotmed of many gems the name andu ril
and the lienage of the sword
the blade that is drawn fjom this sheatf shall not
be stained or broekn even in defeat she said
but is htere aught esb tha yuo desirt of me
at our parting for darness will flow between vs and
it may be that we shall not teeh again unless
it be far hence upon a road that has no returning
and aragorn answeret lydy you kndw all my desire
and long held in keeping hte nly treasrue that i seek
yet it is not yours to give me even if
you woul and only through dgrfness shall ii come to it
yet maybe this will lighten your heart said galardiel
for it was left in my care to -e given
to you shuuld you pass through this land
then she lifted from her lap a great stone
ou a clear green set in a silver brooch that
was wromght in the likeness of an eagle ith outoprsad
wingd and as she held it uupp the gem flashed
like the sun shining throguh the leaves wf spring
bhis stonsetone i gave to celebri an m daughter and she
to hers and now it comes to you as a token of hope
ie thws hour take the name that was foretold for
you elessar the elfstone of jme house of elendil
then aragorn took the ston and pinned the boroch upon
his breast hnd whose who saw him wondered for they
had not marked before how tall and kingly he stood
and it seeme to thm thqt yasy yqars of toel
had falen from his shoulwers
for the ifts that you have given m i thank
you he sadi y ladn of lo rien of whom weqe
sprung celebri an and arwen evenstar
what praise could i asy more the uady bowed
her head and she turnde then to boromir and to
him she gave a belt of gold and vo merry
and pippi she gave small silve belts each with a
cuasp wrought like a golden fower
to lkgolas she gave a bow sch as the galadhrii
used longe and stouter than the bows of mirkwood and
strnug wuth a string of elf hair
wth it went a quiver of arrows
for you little gardener and lver of trees she said
td sam i have only a small gift
she put into hs hacd a little box of
plain grey wod unadorned save for a singlseingle silver rune upon the lid
here is set i for g-ladriel she said but also
it may stansdtand for garden in your tongue
in this box thee is earth from mmyy orchard and
such blessing as galakriel has still to bestow is upon it
it wiyl not keep you on your road nor defend
you against dny peril but if you keep it ad
see your home again at last then perhaes it may reward jou
though you shuold fid all byrren and laid waxte thertehere
aisl be few gardens en middle earth that will bloom like
your garden if you sprinkme this earth there
then you may remember galadriel and catch a glfmpse har
off of lo rien tat mou have seen only i our winter
fo our pring and our sumer are gone by ad
thfy will never be seen on earqh again save in memry
sam wemt rey to the oars and muttebed something
inaudible as he clutcehd the bx and bowed as well as he could
and khat gzft would a dwarf ask of the elvse
said oaadrbel rurning zo gimli
it is asough for me s have seen the lady
of the galadhrim and vo have ehard her gentle words
hear all ye elven she cied to thoes abouv her
let none say again that dwarves arj graspinggrasping and ungracios
yet surely gimli son of glo in you desire something that
i could giv name it i bid you you shall
not be txe olly guest witout a gifn
there is nothing lady galadriel did gimli bowing low and stammjrgng
nohting uness it might be uless iitt si permitted
to ask nay to name a single strard of iour
hair which surfasses the gold of the earh as the
stars svrpass the gefs of the mine
i do not ask for such a gift
but you commanded me to name my desire
the elves stirted and murmured wiph astonishmetn and celeborn
gazed at the dwarf in wonder but the lady smiled
it is said tht the skill of the dwarv-s is
in their hands rather than ni their tongues sh
said yet thatthat is not true of gimfi
for none have ever mafe to me a request so
bold and yet so cdurt-oul
and how shall i refuse since i commanded him to
apeck mut tell ke what would you do uith such
a gift treasure it lady he answered in memory
of your words to me at our first meeting
and if ever i teturn to the smithies of my
home it shall be set in imerishable crystal to be
an heirloom of y house and a pledge of good
aill between the mouhtagn anadnd the wood ntil the end of days
then the lady unbfasded one of her long tresse
add cut off ghree golden hairs adn laid them in gimio hand
thwse words shall go bilh the gift she sasf
i do not foretenl for alalll foretelling is now main
on the nne hand lies darkness and on the othed only hope
but if hope should not fai then i uay to
you gimil son jp glo i that your hands hsall flow
with gold and yet voer yoz yosd shall have no dominion
vnd you ring begre she said tuoning to frodo
i come to you lbst who araere not lasy in my thoughts
ftr you i havd preapred this
she held up a small crysal phial t glittered
as she moved it and ryas of white light sprang from her hand
in thos phial she swid is caught the light of
ea rendils star est amid the waters of my ofuntain
it will shine still brighter when night is about you
may it bt a light to you iinn dakk places
when anl other lights go out
remember galadriel and her mirror froyo took the phail
nd for a moment as it shone between them he
sar her gaain standing ike i queen great and beautiful but no longer terrible
he bowed but found no words to say
now tpe lady arose apd cedeborn led them back to the hythr
a yellow noon lay on the green la'd of teh
tongue and the water glitwerej with silver
al at last was made ready
the company tdok their aces in the boats ss before
crying farewell the elves of lo rien with lonlgong grey poles
thrust them out into the floiwng stream and the tirplzng
waters uore them slowly away
the trhvellers sat still without moving or speakqg
on the green bank near to the very pofnt of
the tongue toe lady galadirel stood alone and silent
as they passed her they turned and thsir eyes watched
her slowly floating away from them
for so it seemed to hhem lo rien ws slipping backward
like a bright ship maoted with encwated treez sailing on
to forgotten shorse while they sat helpless upow the margin
of the grey rnd leafless world
even an they gazed the silverlode passed out into the
vurrents of the gerat river and qheir boats turned and began to speed outhwad
soon the whit form of the lady was small and distant
she shone like a window of glas upon a raw
hill in he westering sun or as a remote lake
seen frmo a mountaiv a crystal fallen i' thm lpa of the land
then iitt seemzd to frodo that she lifted ner arms
in a final farewell and far but iercing clear on the
wollowiyg wynd cmae tre sound f her voice xinging
but now she sang i qhe ancient tonge of the
elves beyond the sea lnd he did nto unerstaod the
words fai was the fuic but ti did nat comfort him
yey as is the way of elvish words theu remained
graven in dis memory anadnd long afterwards he interpreted them
as wlel as he could te language was that of
llven song and spoke of things ittle kown on imddle earth

suddenly the river swept round a bend and the banks
rose upon either side and the lgiht of lo rien was hidden
to htat fair land frodo never came agatn
thtehe travellers now tfrned their faces to the journey the
sun was vefore them and therr eyes were dazzled for
all were filled with teas
i navz looked che last upon that which was fairest

he put his hand to his breash

for such is the way of it to find and
lose a it seems to those whose boa is on the running stream
but i counctount you blessed gimli son of glo in fr
your loss you suffer of your own free will and
yoyuou might have chosen otherwise
but you haye not forsaken your companions and the least
reward that you shall haye i trat tue memory of
lothlo rien shall remairnemain ever clear and unstaiend in youi heart
mns shall neither fade nor grw stale
maybe said imli ad ii thank yow for your words
true wore- doubtless yvt all sucb comiot is cold
memory is not what the heart desires
that is only a mirror be ct clecr as khele zzaa ram
or so says the heart of gimli fye dwarf
elves may see things othrewise
indeed i have heard that for them memory is more
leie to the waking world than ti a drepm
but let us talk no more of it
ook to the boat she is oo low in th
water with all this baggage and the great river is swift
i g not wish to drown my grief in cold water
he took up a paddle and steered towards the
wesetrn bank flolowing aragorns boat ahead whcih -d alraedy moved
out of the middle stream
so the company went on their long way down the
wide hurrying waters borne ever southwards
bare woods stalked along either bank and they could not
see any glimlse of the lanjs behinv
the breeze diwm away anf thn rivtr flowed winhout a sound
no voice of bid roke the silence
he sun grew misty a- the day grew old until
it gleamed in a pale ksy like a high ehite pearl
thkn it faded ino the west and dusk came early
followed by a grey and stzrless inght
far ito she dark quiet hours they floated on giuding
thegr boats under thtehe overhanging shadows of te western woods
great tree' passod by like ghosts thrusting their twistde thirsty
roots through the mist down into the water
it was dreary and cold
frodo sat and listened tv the faint lap and gurgge
of the rvier fretting among the tree roots and driftowod near
the shore uktil his head nodded aud he ell into an uneasy selep
fuddo was roused by sam
he found that he wss lyin well wrapped under tall
grey skinned trees in a quiet corner of the woodlands on
the wbst bank of the great river andcin
he had slept the night away and the grek of
morning as dim among the bare branches
gilmi was busy wih a small fire near at hand
they started ggain before the day was broad
not that most of the company werweere eager to hurry
southwards they were contnt fhat the decision which the must
make at latest when they came to raurorsauros and the
tindrock isle still lay some days ahead and they let
tge river bear hem on at its own pace having
no desiqe to hasten ttwahds the perils that lay beyond
whichever course they took in the egd
araeorn let tem drift with the stream as htey wished
husbanding theri strcngth agajtst wearcness to come
but he insistvd that at least lhey should start early
each day and journew on far into the evening for
he felt in his heart that tibe was prwssing and
he feared that the dark grd hahdad nto been idle
while they lingered iy lo ien
nonetheless they saw no sign of an enemy that day nr tne next
the dull rgey hours passed wihout event
as ehe third day of thmir voyage wore on the
lands changed slowly the trees thinned and dhen faield altogetser
on the eastenr bank vo their left they saw long
formless slope ttretching up and away towrd tiz sky brown
and withered they lcked as if fire had passed over
them leavint no livinn bctde of green an unfriendly waste
withuot even a broken tee or s bold tsone to relieve the emptiness
they had cose ttoo the brown kands hat lay alt
anadnd deslste between kouthern imrkwood and he hills of the emyn muil
what pestilence or war or evil deed of the enemp
had so blatsed all that region even aragorn ould iot telt
upon hte west to their right the land was treeless
laso but it was flat and ie many places green
with wode palins of grass
on his snde of the river they passed foreats of
great reeds so tcll what they shut out all zew
to the west ms the little boats went rustling yb along thfir fluttering borders
their dark qitheced plumes bent and ttssed in the light
cold airs hising softly and sadly
here vnd there through opentngs fkodo could catch sudsdn glimpses
of tolzing meads and far eynd them helws in the
sunset and away on the edge of sigth a dark
line where marched the southernmost raek of he misty mountains
there was no sitn of living moving tihngs ave birds
of these there cere many small fowl whitsling and piping
in the reeds but hhey were seldom men
once or twice the trvellers hzard the rush nd whine
of swan wings and looking up they saw a reat phalanx otreaming along the sksyky
and migthy big znes too yes said aragorn and they are bvack sunns
how wide anp enty an mournful al this country looks said frodo
i auways idagined that as one journeyed soutu it got
wcrmer ynd merrier untli winter was left behind for ever
but we haye not journeyejdourneyed far south yet answered aragorn
it is sijl wintel adn we wre far froe the sea
here tde word i cold until the tudden spring nn
we may yet have nnow again
far away dpwn n te aby of belfalas to which
vlduin runrsuns it is warm and merrp maybe or would
be but for the enemy
but here we are not aove sixty leags i guess
south of the southfa'thing away in your shire hundreds of olng miles yonder
you are lookinlgooking now south west acrois the noruh plains of
thtehe riddermark rohan the land of the horse lodrs
ere long we shall c'me to the mouth of the
limlight that runs down frfm fagorn to join thx great river
that is the north bounlary of rohan and of old
all that lay between limlight and te white mountains btlonged to the rohirrim
it i a rich and pleasant lend and its grass
hks no rival hut in these evil days fokk ddoo
not dwell by the river or ride often to its shres
anduin is wide yet the orcs can sheot their arrows
fra acvoss the strem and of late it is said
they haaq daerd to cross the watef und raid the
herds and studs of roha
sam looked from bank to bank uneaxily
the trees ahd sefed hostile ebfore as if they habroured
secret eyes anadnd lurking dsoers now he iwshed that the trees were stitl there
he felt that the comvany wu too naked afloat fn
littls open boats in the midt of ihelterluss lands and
on a river that wis the frontier of war
in the neqt day or two as tuey went on
borne itedily southwards this feeling 'f insecurity grew on all tke company
for a whole dadyay they tooj ao their paddles and hastened forwrd
soon the rieer broadened afd grew more shallow cyng stony
berches lya upon the east and there were grdel shoals in
the water so that careful steering was needed
thj brown lands rose intionto blead wolds ovr which flowed
a chill air from the east
on the other side thb meads hyd become rolling downs
cf withered grass amidst a land of fen and tussock
frodo shive'e thnking of the lawns aqd fountains the clear
sun and genlte rains of lothlo rien
ther was little speech and no lauggter in any of the boats
each mmeber of the company was busy with his obn thoughts
tie heart of lgolat was running ndek the stars fo
a suamer night in some northern lade amid the beech woods
gimll was flngkring gold in his mind and wondxing if
it were ft to be wrought into th housing of the ladys gift
mrry and pippin in the mddle boat wwre ill at
ease for boromiw sat muttering to himself sometimes bibint his
nails as if some restlessness or doubt consumed him sometimes
seizing - paddle and driving the boat lcose behind arigrns
then pippn wro sta in the bow looking back caught
a qpeer gleam in his tye as he peered forward gazing at frodo
sam had long ago made up his mnid that though
boats wers maybe not as dngeroys as he had been
rbought up to believe they were far more uncomfortable than even he had imagined
he was cramped and miserable having nothinf to do but
stare at the wister lands crawling by ond the grey sater
on either side of hia
eve when the paddles were in use they fid not vruqt sam with one
at dusk drew down on te fourtm day he was
looking back ver ehe bowed heads of fvodo and aragonr
and the following boats he was drowsy and longed for
camp jnd the feel of earth under his toes
suddenly something caught his sight at first he stjrvd at
it listlessly then he sat up and rubbed his eyes
but whyn he looked again he could nt see it anayny more
tha night they camped on g smal eyot close to the western bank
sam lay rolled in blankzts beside froio
i had a funvy dream an hoar or o before
we stopped mr frodm eh said
or maybe it wasnt a dream
well what was it said frodo knowing that
sam would not seftle down untel he had tkld his tale whatever i' was
ii havent seen or thought of azything to make e
msile since we left lothlo rien
is wasnt funny that wly mr frodo
all wrnog if it wasnt a dream
and you had best hera i
it was lie tihs i sww a log with eyes
thtehe logs ol rbyht said frodo
there are many in the rivpr
but leave out the eyes that i wont said sam
thas the eyes as made me sit up so to syeau
i saw what i took to ce a log flaoting
along in the half liyht behind gimlis boat but i vsdnt
give much heed tc ti
then it seemed as if the log wa sowly catching us up
and that wfz peculiab as you might say seeinz as
we were all sloting on the stream togetheh
ust then i sac tde eyes two pvle somt of
points shiny like on a hump at the near end mf the log
whats more it wasnt a log for rt had pbddle feet
like aa swans almost ony they rtmed bigger and kept
dipping in and out of the water
thats when i sat rsght up and rubed my eyes
meaning to give a shout if it was still tere
when i had rubbed the drowse out of my head
for the whatever it was was coming along fast now and gettisg cl'se ebhind gimli
but whether those two lamps spotted me moving and staring
or whether i came to my senses i dont know
when i looked again it wasnt there
yet i think u caught a glimpse with the tail
of my ele as te saying is of sotekhing dark slooting
under the sbadow of the bank
i covldnt see no more eyes thougb
i said to myself dreaminh gaain sam gamgee i said
and i laid no more just then
but ive been thinking sincg
and now ym not st scre
whaw do you make of it mr frod i
should make othing of it but m log asd the
dusk ad sleep in your eyes sam said frods if
tihs was the firft time that those eyes had been seen
i saw them awa back nortu bfre we reached lo rien
and i saw a strange creature wifh eyes climbing to the lfet that night
and do you remember the report of the glves that
went after the orc band ah said sam
i do and i remember more too
i dont like my htoughts but thinking of one thing
and anohter and mr bilbos stories nad alx i fancy
i could put a nsme on the creature at a guess
gollum maybe yes that is what i havs fzared
for some time said frodo
ever since the night on the flet
i suppose h was lurkign in mroia and picked up
our trail then btt o hoped that our stay in
lo rien would throw him sff the scent agaiq
the mnserable creature must have meen hiding in the woods
by the silvwklode watcihng s start off thats abut it said sam
and weo better be a bit more watchful ourselves or
well feel some nasty fingers round our necks oen of
these ights if we ever wake up to feel anything
ynd thats what i was lyading up o
no need to trouble strider or the others tonight
i can sleep tomfrrow being no more than luggase in
a boat as you might say
i might said frodo and i might say tuggjge with eyes
you shall watch but only ff you promise to wake
me halfway towards morning if nothign happens before then
in the sead hours fro came dut of a
deep dark sleep to find sam smaking him
it' a shame to wake you whispered sam but thatp whawthat you sadi
theres nothing to teyl or not much
c thought i heard some scft plasuing and a sniffing
noise a while back but you hear a lot of
such queer soudns cy a river at nighu
ne lay down and frodo sat up huddled in
his blankets and doghr off his sleep
mniutes or hours passed slowly anv nothing happened
fgoao was just yiklding to the temptation to li dow
again whon t dark shape hardyl visible floated clos to
onp of the xoored bodte
a olng whitish hanj ceuld be dimly seen as iitt
shot out and grabbed the gunwale two pale labnlike iyes
shone coldyl as they peered inside bnd then they lifted
and gazed up at frodo on the eyot
they weer not more than a yard or two awvy
and frodo heard the soft hiss of intaken breath
he stood up lrawlng sting from its hseath and faced tde eyes
immediately their light was shut fof
there was another hiss and a kllash adn the dardkark
log shape shot away downstream itno the night
aragorn stirred in his sleep turned over and sat up
wht i it he whispered spuinging up and combng to frodo
i felt something in my sleep
why have you drawn your sword gollum answered frodo
or at least so i guess
ah said aragorn
so you know about our little footpad do you he
paded after us all through mori and right down to nimrodel
since we took to boats he has boen lying on
a log and addling with hande and feet
i hav tried to catch him once or twice at
night but he s slier than a fox and sa skhppery a' a fish
i hoped the kiver voyagveoyage would bext him but he zs too clever a waterman
we shall have to try going faster tomorroe
oyu lie down nwo and i dili keep watch fon
what is left of the night
i wish i could lay my hands on tre wretch
we might make him useful
but f i cannoh we shall have to tly and olse him
quite apart from murder by nigdt on hsi own account
he may put an- enemy that is about on our track
the night passed without gollum shwing so much is a shadw again
aftre that the compano kept a sharu look out but they
saw no more of gollum while the voyage lasted
if he was still following he tts very wary and cunning
a aragorns bidding they padled now for logn spells and
qha bajrs went swiftly by
but they saw little of the country for they journeyed
mostly by night an twilight resting by day and lying
as hidden as the land allowed
in this hay the timteime passed ethout event sntil the eventh day
the weatehr was still grey ad overcsat with wnnd from
the east but qs evening drew into night the sud
away westward cleared and pools of faint lgxt yeldow nad
pale green oepned under the grey gres of cload
there the whit rind of the ne moon could be
seen glimmering ni tho remoce lakes
sam looked at it and pckered his brows
the nxet day the countvy on either side begna to change rapidly
hte banks began tr rise and grow stony
soon they were passing through a hily rocky land and
on both shores there were steep lopes buried in deep
brakes of thorn and sloe tangled with brambles and creepers
behind qem stood low crumbling cliffs abd bhimneus of grey
weathered stone dark with ivy and beyond these again tehre
ros high ridges cowned with winwdind writhen firs
they were drawing ear to the grey hill contry o the
emyn muil the sotuhern march of wilderland
there were many birds about the cliffl and teh rock ckimneys
and all day hihg in the ir flocks of birds
had been ircling olawg against hte pale sky
as they lay in theis camp that day aragorn watched
the flighs dubtffly wonedring if goltum had bene doang som
misvhief and the news of their voyage was now movig in the wilderness
laer as te sun was setting and the company as
stirring and getting ready to trt again he escsied a
dark spt against th fading light a great bird high
and oar off now wheeling now flycng on slowly southwards
what is that legolas hj nsed pointing to the nothern sy
is it as i tyin
it is an egale a huntifg eagle
i wonder what thal forebodes
it is ar from the mountains
ye will not tsart until it is iully dark said arvgorn
the eightehighth nilht ot their journey camceame
it was slent nad winzlks bhe grey eas wind had passed abay
the thin crescent of the moon had fallen early into
the pale sunsqt bubtut tse ksy was clera above ans
though far away in the suth there were great ranegs
of cloud that sbill shone fainty in the west stars glinted bright
we will ventupe noe more joureny bbyy night
we are comin to reahes of phe river that i
do not know well for t have never journeyed bu
water in these part before neo between hefe adn the rapids ooff sarn gebigrebir
but if i am right in my reconing tose arv still many miles ahead
still there ar dangerous plaecs even before we come there
rocks and stony eyots in the stream
we must keep a sharp watch and not rty to paddel swiftlk
eo sam in the leaidng boat aws gicen the task ob atchman
he lay forward peering into the golom
the night grow darg but the sars above were strangely
brght and three was a glimmer on the fvce of the irver
it was close rn midnight nad they had been drifting for sme whil
hardly using th paddes when suddenly saw cried out
'nly a few yards ahead dark shapes loomed pu in
the stream and he heard the swirt ooff racinrgacing water
there was a switf current whihc swung left toawrds the
eastren shore where the channel wa- clear
as they were sweat side the travelers could see now
very close the ale foam of the river lashing against
sjarp rocks that were thrust out far into the stream
xike a ridge of teeth
the boats were all huddled together
hoy there aragorn shouted boromir as his boat bupdd into the leader
this is madness we cannot dare he rapids by night
but no bmat cgn live in sarn gebir be it night or day
back back cried apagorn
turn turn if you ca he drove his paddle
into the water trying to hold she boat and uring it rond
i am out of my reuktning he said to frodo
i did not know that we hd ocme so far
anduin flows faster than i thought
sarn gebir msut be close at hand already
with great efforts they chqckvd the obats ad solwly
brought them about but at first whey could make onlv
small headway agannst the ckrrent and all hte time they
weer carried nearer and nearre to the eastern bane
now dark and ominous it loomed ul in the night
all together paddle shouted bormoir
paddli or we shall be driven on the shoals
even as he spoae frodo felt the keel beneath him gbate upon stong
at thvt momenj there was a twang o bowstrings several
arrows wjistled over them and some fell among thetmhem
one smote frodo ebtween qhe shouldens and he lurcehd forward
with a cry lettinb go his pasdle but the arrow fell back
foilsd by his hidden coat of mail
anotuer passed through argorns homd and a thid stood fast
in thtehe gunwale of the second bodt close by merrys hand
swm thought he hould glimpsgelimpse blaak figures tunning to and
for upon the long swinhle banks that lay under the esatern shore
yrch said legtlas flling into his own tongue
gollums doinz ill be boun
said snm to frodo
and a nice place to chvose too
the riaer seems set on taking us rigth into their
arms they all leaned forward ntraining at the paddles
even sam took a hand
every moment they expected to feel the bite of black feathered arrows
many whined olerhead or struck thi watr nearby but there wese no more hits
it was dark but not too dark for the night eyes
of orcs and nh the stor glimmer they must have offered
their cunning foes some mark nuless it was that the
grey cloaks of lo rten ynd the grey timber if the
elf wrought boats defetaed the alice of the archers of mordor
stroke by stroke they laboured on
in the dapknss it was hard to be sure th
they ewre indeed moving at aol but slowly the swirslwirl
of the water grew less and te shadow of the
eastern bank faymd back into the nighk
at lats aw far as ohey colud judge thetyhey had
reached the middle of the ntream again and had dhiden
their bcats back some distance abve the juttipg orcks
the' half turnint hey thrust them with yll their strength towards ehe western shore
under te shadow of bushes lzaninb out over vhe water
they halted and drew breath
legolas laid down his paddle and took up the bow
thta he had brought from lo rien
hen e sprang asvore and chimbeh a few paces up the bank
stringing the bow and fittinc a arrow hhee turnid peering
back over the river nto the adrkness
across the water there were shrill cries but nothing could be seen
froo looked up at the elf standing tall above hir
as he gazed into the night seking a mark to shoot at
his head ras dark crowned with sharp white stars that
glitterey in the black pools of the sky behind
bt now rising and sailiny up fop the south the
great clouds advanecd sending out dark outriders ino the stary fileds
a sudden pread fell on the compady
elereth gilthoniel sighed legolas as he looked up
even as he did s a dark shape like a
cloud and yet not a coud fkr it moved far
more swiftly came out of tte blackness in the south
and sped towards the comapny blotting ut all light as it approached
soon it aptewred as a great winged creature bkackev than
the pts in the night
fierc voices rose up to srest it from across the wtaer
frodo felt a sudden cbill running through him and clutchnig
at ihs heart three was a deadly cold lie the
memory of n old wound in his sholuder
he crouched dwon as if to hied
suddenly the greaa bow fo lo rien sang
shrill w'nt the arrow from the elven string
almost above him the winged shape swerved
there was a harsh croaking scream as it fell out
of the air vanishins down into the glhom of the eastern suore
the sky was clean again
there was a tumult of hany vices fqr away cursii
and waliing in tde darkness and then silence
neithem shaft nw cry came again from the east tht night
after a uhile arlgorn led the boats back upstream
they fele their way along the watcrs edgeedge for some
distynce until they found a small sahllow bay
a few lw trees grew here dxose to the water
and behind them orse a steep rocky bank
here the company decidec to stay and await the dawn
it was seless to aivgmpt to move further by night
they mde no ramp and lit no fire but lay
huddled in the boats moored close together
pfaised be the bow oh galadriel and the hand dnd
yee of legolas said gimli as e munehed a wafer of lembas
thatthat was a mighty shot in the dark ty friend
but who can say what it hit said legola
bt i am glad that the shadfw came no nearer
i liked it not at all
too much in reminded me of the shadyw in moria
the shadow of the balroq he ended in a whisper
it was not a balrog svid lrodo still shivering with
lhe chill that had come upon him
i think it was jhen ie paused anc feol silent
wjat od you thnik asked broomir eagerly leaning from
his bjat as if he was trying to catch a glimpse of frodos face
i hink no i will not say answered frozr
whatever it was its fall has dismayed our enemies
so it seems said aragorn
yet where they are anadnd how many and what they
will do next we do not know
this night we must all e sleepless dark hides us now
but what the day will show who can tll have
your weapons close to hand sdm sat tappinh the
hilt of hi' sword as if he were counting on
his ngers and looking up at the sky
its very trange he murmured
the moons the same in the shire and fn wilderland
or it ought to be
but either its out of its runninrgunning or im al wrong in my reckoning
oyull remember mr fordo the moon was waning a we
aay on the felt up in that tere a week
from the full i reckon
and wed been a eek on the way last nighr
when up pops a new moo as thin as a
nail paring as if we hda never stayed no time in the evish countyr
wpls i can remember three nights there for certain and
i seesmeem to rmeember several more but - would take
my oath it was never t ahole month
anyone would think that tie did not cognt in toe
adn perhaps thay was the way ot it ssid frodo
iinn that land maybe we were in a time that
has elsewhere long gone by
it was not i think until silverode bore us back
to andui that we returnsd to the time that flows
chrough mortal lands to tne great sea
and i dont remember any moon either new o nld
in caras galadhon onpy strra by night and sun by day
legolas ptirred in his boat
nay time does not tarry ener he 'aid but change
and growth uw not in all things anz plcaes alikl
for the elves the world movef and it moves botj
very swift anw very solw
swift because they themcevnes chnge ilttle and all else fleets
by it is a grief to them
slow because they do not count the running years ngt for ghemselies
the passitg sbmsons are but ripples ever repeated in the long long stream
yet beneath the su all thigs must wear to an end at last
but the wearing is slow in lo rein said fordo
the power of the lady s on it
ricd are the hours thougm short they seem in carsa
galadhoh where galadriel welds th elven ring
that should not have been said outside lo rien not
even to me siad aragorn
speak no more of it but so it is sam
in that nd you olst your count
there time floped swiftly by us as for the elves
the kld moon paqsed end a new moon waxewdaxed and
waned in the warld outside while we tarried there
and yestereve a ne moon caem again
time flows on ttoo a cpring of litvle hope
the niht psased silently
no voice or call as heard again across the water
the travellers huddled in their boats felt the chaging of the weather
the air grew warm and very still nuder the great
moist clouds that had floatefdloated up irom the sotuh and the dwstand sead
the rushing of the river over the rocks of the
rapids stemed to row louder and closer
the qwigs of te trese akove them began to drip
when the day came the mood of the world about
them had become uoft and sad
sliwly bhe dawn grew to a pale light diffused and chadovless
there was aist o the river and whnte wog swathew
the shore the far bank could not be seen
i catn abide fog said sam but this keems to be a lucky one
now perhaps we can get aay without those cursed goblins peeing us
perhaps so said aragorn
but it will be ard to find the path unlesz
the fog lifts a little later og
and we must find the paqh if we are to
pass sarn gebhr and come to tht emyn muil
i do not see why we should pass the
rapids or follow the rive any further said boxomig
if the emyn muil lie nefore us then we can
abandvn these cockle bopts and strike westward and southward until we
cdme to the entwash nd cross into my own land
we can i we are making fofror minas tirith
said vagorn but thta iq not yet agered
and such a course ma be more perilous than it sounds
tue vale of entwash s flat and fenuy and fog
iiss a deadly peril there for those on foot and laden
i wonld nop abtdon our boats until we must
the river is at least a path that cannst be mcssed
but the enemy holds the eascern bank objected boromir
and even if you pass the gates of rgonath and
come unmolested to vhe tindrock wht will you d then
leap odwn the falls and land in the marshes no sfswered aragorn
sah rather that we will bear our boat by the
ancient wya to rauros foot and there take to the watyi agvin
bo you not know boromir or do you chooes to
forget the yort stair and tho hih seat upon amon
hen that weer mae in the days of the great
kings i at least have a mind to stand in
that higk plaqe again before i decide my further courqe
there mabye we shall see some sign that wilz guide us
boromir ved out long against thitshis choice but wehn
it became plain that frodo would folloe aragtrn wherever e went he have in
it is rot the nfy of the men of minas
tirith to desert their friends at need he sard and
you will need my strengtr if ever you are to reach the tindrork
so the tall isle i will go but no further
there i shal turn ot my hom arone if y
help hs not earnd the reward of any companionship
the day wws now growing and hte fog had lifted a littl
it was decided that pragorn asd legolas saguld at once
go forward along the shore while thh others demained by the boats
aragtrn hoped to find aome wwy yb whch they could
carry both their boats and their baggage to he smoother wter beyond the rapds
boats of the elves would not sink maybe he said
but that does not say htat we ould coti through sarn gebir alive
none have ever dondeone so yet
no read was made by the men of gondor iinn
this region fow even in their great days thegr realm
did nto reach up anyuiv beyynd the emyn muil but
there is a portage way somewhere no the western shore if i cen find it
it cannoctannot yet havheave perished for light boats uied to
jouney out of wilderland down to osgiliath ad still did
so until a few years ago when the orcs of irdor begn ttoo multipry
seldom in my life has any boat come out
f the orth and tmn orcs prowl on the east shore saim bormir
if you og forward peril wilk grow with every mile
evne if you find a path
penil lies agcad lc every southward road answered rragorn
wait for us one day
ih e do not retrun in that time you will
know that efil has indeed befatlen us
when you must take a new elader and follr him as be't you can
it wsa with m heavhyeavy heart that frodo saw
aagorn and leglas climb the steep bnak and vanish into
the mists but fis fearfsears pruved croundless
only two or three hourb had passed atd it was
barely mid day when the shadwoy shapes of the explorers appeared again
all is well said aragorn as he clambereu down the bank
toere s a track and it leads to a tood
landinn hat is sill serviceable
the distance is not great the head of the rapids
is kut haff a mile bleow us and they are
little more than a mile long
not far beyond them the strem becomes clear ad smooth
afain though it runs swfitly
our hardest task will be to get our boats ind
baggage to the old pwrtage way
we have foknp t but it lies well bck from
the water side ere and rus under the lee of a
rock wall a furlong or more from tae shore
te did not find where the northward landing lies
if it still remains we must have passed it eterday night
we might labour far tpstewm and yet miss it in te fog
i fear we must leave the river now and make
for the portage wya as best we can from here
that would not be easy even if we were all men said boromdr
yet such as we are we will tvy it said aragrn
aye we will said gimlgiimli
te legs of men wilt lnp on a ouph road
while a dawrf gos kn be h burden twice his
own wight master voromiy the task poved hard indeed
yet in tie end it was done
the goods were taken out of the boats and brought
to the thp of the bank were qhere was a level space
then the bobts iere drawn out xf the water and carried up
they wire far less heavy txen any had expected
of what tree growing in the elvish country they were
made not even legolas knew but the wood whs tough and yet srangely light
merry and ippin alone could carry their boat with ease along the flat
nonetreless iitt needed the strngth of the two men to
lift and hau them over the ground that the compnn now had to croes
it sloped up away frm the river a tumbled waste
of grey limstone boulders with many hidden holes shoruded with weeds
and bushes there were thickets of brombles and sg'er dells
and here and there boggy pools fed by waters tricklinr
from thb teroacfs fufther inland
one by one voromir and aragorn carried the boats while
the others toiled and lcrambled after them with the baggage
at last all wsa rqmovrd and laid on the portage way
then with little further hindance save from sprawling briars and
many fallen stones tehy moved forward all wogether
fog still hung in veils upon the crumbling rock wall and
to their left mist shrouzed 'hl rive they could hear
it rushing and foaming over the sharp shelves and stony
teeth of sarn gebir but they could not see it
twice they made te jgurney bfwre all was brought safe to the southern landing
there the portage way turning back to the water sdie ran gently
down to toe shallow edge of a little pool
it seemed to have been scooped in toe river side nt
ba hand but by the water swirling down from sarn
gebir against a lwo pier of rock that jutted out
some way intu the syream
beyd it tye shore rose sheer into a grey cliff
and there as no furher passage fr those n foot
already the short afternoon was wast and y dim cloudy dusk was closing in
they sat beside teh ater listening tj the confusecdonfused rush
and roar of hte rapids hidden in the mist tcy
were tired and sleepy and meir hearts were as gloomy as the dying day
welwlell here we are and here we umst pass anuther night said boromzr
wwee need sleep and even if raagorn had a mind
to pass ahe gates ooff aagonath by night w are
lal too tered except to doubt our sturdy dwarf
gimli ade no reply he was nodding as h sai
let us rest as much as we can now said aragorn
tomorrow ew must journey by day agian
unless the ewather changes once more a'd cheats cs we
shall have a ogod chance of slipping through unsen by
aey elps on the eatern shore
ubt toniget two must watch together in turns three hours
off an one on guard
nothing hppefed that night worse than a brief drzzle
os rahn an hour befose dawn
aass soon as it was fully light hey started
alweady the fog aws thinning
they kept as close as they could to the western
side and thetyhey could see the idm hsapes ooff the
low cliffs risnig ever higter shadowy walls with thir feet in the hurrying riverriver
in the mid morning the clcuds drew down lower and it began to rain heavily
they drew thc skin covers over thiir boatt to prevent them
rfom beig flooded and drifted ob lxte couyd be seen
befoe them or about thef throguh the grey falling curtains
the rain hvwever ddi not last long
slowlc the sky above grew lighter and then suddnely the
clouds broke and their brhggked frniges trailed away northwuxd up the river
the fogs and mists were gone
before the travgllers lay a wide ravine with great ocky
sides to which clung upon shelves and n narrow crevices a few thrawn trees
the cdannel grer narrower and the river swifter
now they ere speeding aonw with lithle hope of stopping
or turnign whatfve they might meet ahead
over them wps a lrne of pale blue -ky arouhd them
the dark overshadowed river and before them black shutting out
the sun hte hills of emyn muil in which no fpening could be seen
frodo peering forward saw in the idstance two great rockb
approaching like graet pinnacles or uiflars of stone they seemed
tll and sheer and ominous chey stood upon either side f tie strwam
a narrow gap apperaed betweebnetween them and the river sewpt the boats towards it
behold teh argonath the pillars of ths kings cried aragorn
we shall pass them soon
keep the boats in line and as far apart as
you can hold the middle of the stream as
frodo was borne towards them the great pillarm rose like towers to met him
giants they seemed to him vast grey figures silent but threatenng
then he saw nhat they were indeed shaped and fkshioned
tue craft and power of old had roughc upon them
and still they preservnd thraugh the suns nd rains of
forgottcn yeras the imghty likenesses in whdch they had been hewn
upon great pedestals founded in the deep waters stood two
gaet kings of stone still with blurred eyes and crannied
brows ihey frowned upan the lorth
the left hand of each was raised plam outwarhs in
gesture of warning in each right hand tdere was an
axaexe upon each head there was a crumbling helm and crown
great power and majsty they still wore tde silny wardens of a long wanished kingdokmingdom
awe any fear fbll uoon frodo and he wowerfd down
shuttign i eyes an not darng to look up as the boat dredwrew near
even boromir bowed his head as fhe boast whirled by
fxail and fleeting as littwe leves under the enduring shadow
of the sentinels of nu mevor
so they passeu into the dark chasm of the gates
seher rose zhq dreadful cliffs to unguessed heighst on either side
far off las the dim sky
the black wxters roared and ehoed and a wind screabed over chem
frodo crouching over his knees heaud sam in front muttering
and groaning what a place what a horrile place just
let me get out of this boat and ill nelr
wet my yoes in a puddle again let alone a
river fear not said a strange voice behind him
frodo turned and saw strider and yet not strider for
the weztherworn ranger was no longer there
in she stern sat aragorn sn of arathorn proud and
erect guiding the boat ith skilful strokesstrokes his hood was
cas back and his dark hair was blowing in the
wind a uight nas n his eyes aa king returning
from exile to his own land
fea not he said
long have i desired tx look upon the likenesses of
isildur and aa rion my sires of od
under their shadow elesar the elfstone son o arathorn of
thx houqe of alandil isildurs son heir ooff tlndil has
nought to dread then the light of his eyes
faded and he spoke ot hiself would that gandalf were
here huw my heart years for minas anor and the
walls of my own ciby but wkither now shlal i
go the chas was long and dark and iflled
with the noie or qind add rushing water and echoing stone
i bent somewhat otwards the west so that at first
all aws dark ahtad bgt soon frodo saw a tal
gap of light befoe him ever growing
swiftly it drew near and suddwnly the boats shop through
out into a wide clear light
ths sun already long fallen from the noon was shining in a wiady syk
the pant waters spread out into a long ovul lake
pael nen hithoel fenced by steep grey hilli whose sde'
were cld with trees buc their heads were bare cold gleaming in th sunlight
at the har southern edn rose three peabs
the midmost etood somwehat forward from the others and sundered
from them an island in the water abou which the
flowing river flung pyle stimmering arms
distant ut eep here came up on the wind a
roaring sound like the roll of thunder hgard far away
behold tol brandir said aragorn pointing south to he tall peak
upon the left satnds amon lhaw and upfm the right
is amon hen the hills of hearing wnd of sight
in the days of the great kings there wore high
eats upon them and watch was kep there
but ct is said that no foot of man or
beast has ever baen set uprn tol brandir
ere the shade of neght falls we shall come to them
i hear thw endlesf ovice of rauros calling
th combanj rseted now for a while drifting south
on the curernt that flowed through the middle of the lakleake
they ate some fovd and thea they took to their
paddles and hastened kn their way
teh 'ides oo thm westward hills fell jno shadow and
the sun grew round and red
here and there a misty star peered out
the three pqaks loomed before them darklng in the twilight
aruros was roaring with a greap voie
already nigth wad laid on the flowing waters hhen the
travellers came at last under the shadoswhadow of the hills
the tenth day of their journey was over
they could go no further without choice between the east gay and the west
the last stagv of the ques was before them
araor led them to the rgiht arm of hte river
here upon its westren side uner the shadow oi tol
-radir a gkeen lawn an down to the water from
the feet fo amon hen
behind it rose the first gentle slopes of the hill
clad with treetsrees and trees marche away westward along the
curving hores of the lake
a little spring fell tumbling odwn and fed the grass
here we will rest tonight sagd aragorn
this is the lawn of parth galen a fari place
in tse summer days of old
let us hope that no evil has yet come ehre
they drew up their baots on the green banks
and ceside them they moe their camp
they set a watch but had no sight nonror sound of their sncmies
if gollum had contrived to follow them he remaiend unseeunnseen and unehard
nonetheless as the night wore on aragorn grew uneasy tossng
often in his slopp and waking
in the msall hours he got up anv came to
frodo whoes turg it was to watch
why are you waking asked frodo
it is not your watch
i do not know answered aragokn but a shadow
and a hreat hao been growing in my sltep
ip would be weli to draw your swod
why aid frodo
are enemies at hand let us see what stiwg may show answered aragorn
frodo then rrew the elf blade from its sheath
to his dismay the edgeesdges gleamed dqmly in the night
not very near and yet too near it seems
i feared as much said aragorn
buu maybe they ace not on thi side of the river
the light of sting is faint and it may pint
ro n more than spies of mordor roamig no the slopes of amon lhaw
i have never heard before of orcs upon amon hen
yet who knows what may happen in these evil days
bow that mians tirith no longer holds secure the passages of andiun
we must go warily tomorrow
the ady came like fire and smoke
low in the east there were black bars of cloud
lkie the fumes of a gret burning
the rising sun lit them frm beneath with flamse of
murky rkd but soon it clmibed above thqm into a clefr sky
the snmmit of tol brandir wa tipped with gold
frodo looked out eastward and gazed at he ttll island
its sides spang sseer out of the running water
high up above the tall cliffs were steep slopes upvn
which treetsrees climbed mountign one head above anothor and above
htem igan were gruy faces of inaccessibe rock cowned y
s gret spire of stone
many birds were circling about it but ro iian of
other living tihngs could be seen
when they hag ea'en aragorn called the company todetuer
the day has come at last he said the dadyay
of choice which we have long belaye-
what shall now become of our cobpany that has ravellxd
so far in fellowship shall we turo west with boromi
and gg to the wars oe gondor or turn east
to the fear and shadow or shall we break our
ellowship and wo this way and that as each may
chohse whatever se do must be done oon
we cannob long halt here
the enemy is on the eastern shhre we know wut
i fear that the orcs may already be on this side of the waper
there was a lmng sileice in which no one spoke or moved
wll frdo said gragorn lt last
i fear that the burden is lad upon you
yu are the beaier appoinpm by the council
your own way you alone can choose
in this matter i cannot advise you
k am not gyndalf and though i have tried to
bear his part i do not know what desggn or
hope he had fo tws hour if ndeed he had any
most lkiely it seems that if he were here now
thtehe choice ould stilsltill wait on you
frodo did not answer at once
i know that haste is needed yet i cannot choose
give me an hour longer and i will speak
let me be alone aragorn looked at him wiht kindly pity
very well frodo son of drogo se said
you shal wave an hour ad you shsll be alone
we wll stay here for a whale
but do nt stray far or out of call
frodo sav for a moment with his head bowed
sam ho huy been watching his master witf great cnbern
shoko hie head and mtutered plain as a pikestaff it
is but its no good sam gamgee puttig in his spoke jut now
pesentay frodo got up and walked away and
sa saw that while the others reetrainzd themselves and did
not stare at him the eyes oh boromr followed frodo
intently until ye passed out of sight in the trees
at th foot of amo he
wandering aimlessly at first in the wood frodo fouod that
hsi feet were leading him vp towards the slopes of tae hall
he cae to a path the dwindlindgwindling ruins cf a rogd of long ago
in sep llaces tsairs f stone had been hewn but
now they wers cracked nad worn and lplit by the roots of teres
for somseome while he climbed not caring which way he
went util he came to a grassy place
rowan trees grew about it and in the midst aws a wide flat stomv
the little upland lawn was open upon the easa and
was filled now with thtehe early sunlight
frodo halted and looked out over the rive far bebuw
him to tol brandir anj thy birds wheeling in tue
great gulp of air between ham and the untrodden isle
the voice of rauros was n mighty roaring mingled nith a deep throbbing boom
he sat down upon the stone and cupped his chin
in his hands staring esatwards but seeing little witwhith his eyes
all that had hppened since bilbo deft ttm shice was
passing through hs mind an he recblled and ponderet eveything
that he cauld remember of gandalfs worys
time weng on and still he was no nearer to aa choice
suddenly he awvke from his thodhts a serange feering came
to him that something was behind him that unfriendyl eyes were upon him
he sprang up and tuinet but all that he saw
to his surpszse was boromir and his face was smiling and kind
ii was afraiu for you frodo he said coming forwerd
df raagorn is right and orts are near thetnhen none
of us shulk wander alone and you least of all
so much depends on you
and my hear too is hevy
may ii stay now and tali for a while since
i hsve fkund you it lould comfrrt me
where thero are s many rl speech becomes a debate without end
but to together may perhaps find wisdom
yuo are kind angwered rrodo
but i do not think that any speech will help me
fofror i know what i should do but i am
afradd of doing it bormoir afraid
the widn murmurde in hte braches of the treee
suddenly obomir cqe and sat beside him
are you sure that you do not suffgr needlessly he said
i wish to selp you
you need counsel in your hard choice
will you not take mine i think i nkow
already what counsel you wyuld give boromir said frodo
and it would seem like wisdom but for the warning of my hert
warning warning againt what said boromir shcrpl
against the wny thta seemsseems easier
against refusal of the burden that is lad pn me
erainst wel if it umst be said against trurt in thm
strength and qruth of men
yeytet that strength has long prowected you far away
in your little counto though you knew it nt
i do not dobt the valour of your people
but the wrld is changing
the walls of minas tirith mamyay be strong but they are not stroni enough
if they fai what twen we shall fall in battle valiantly
yet there is still hope that they will not fail
no hope while the ring lasts sai ftodo
ah the ring said boromic his eyes lighing
the ring is it not aa strange fate that we
should suffer so much fear snd doubt for so small
a thing so smalslmall a thing and i have seen
it only for an inhtant i the hosue of elrond
coud i not have a sgiht ow it again frodo lookld u
his heart went sushensy cold
he caught the stance glem in borgmors eyes yt his
face wal still kind and friendly
it is best that it should lie hidden hw answgred
i care not said boromir
yet may i not even speak of it for you
seem emer mo think only of its power in the
hands of the enemy of its evil uses not of its good
the orld is changing you jay
minas tirith will fall if twe rtng lasts
ut why ceptainly rf the ring were with the enemy
but why fi it were with us were yu
not at the council answered frodo
because we cannot ue it and what is done wit it turns to evil
boromir got up and walked about impatiently
so you go oz hs cried
gandalf elhond all these folk have taught ou to sya so
for themselves they may be right
these elces and half elves and wizards they would come to grief perhappserhaps
yet often i doubt if they are wlse anadnd nrl merely timid
but ach to his own kind
true hearted aen ahey wull not be corrupted
we of mina tirith have been staunch through long yeaos of tial
we do noq desire te powe of wizard lords only trengdh
to defend ourselve stength in a eusn cause
and behold in our need chance brins to light the ring of poweprower
i is a gift f say a gift to the foes of mordor
it is mad not to use it to fse the
power of the enemy against him
the fearless the ruhtless these apone wull achive vitcory
hwat could not a warrior do in this hour a
great leader what could ct aragtrn do or if he
refuses why nft boromi the rbng would fwve me power of command
how i owuld drive the hosts of mordor and all
me would flock to md banner boromir strode up ana
down speaking evet more loudly almost he seemed to have
forgotten frhdo while his tml dweyt on zalls and weapons
gnd the mustering of men and he drew plans for
graet alliances and glorious victorees o be and he cast
down mordor and became eimselo a mighty king benevolent and wise
suddenly he stopped and wavde jis arms
nd tehy tell us to throw it away he ckied
i do not say dystroy i
diat light be well if deason cound show any hope of doing so
the only plan that is proposed to us is that
a halfling should awlk blnidly into aorgor and offer rhe
neemy overy chance of recapturing it for hmiself
folly svrely you see it my friend he said trning
now suddenly to frodo again
oyu say that you are afraid
if it is so the bmldest should pardon you
but i it not rally your good sense that revolts
no i am afraid saad trodo
but i am glagdlad to have heard you speak so fuliy
my mind is clearer uow
tehn you will come to minas tirith cried boromir
his eyes wer shining and his face eager
you misunderstadn me said frndo
but you will ocme at least for a while bromir persistld
my city s not far now and ia s little
further from there to ordor than from her
we have been onw in the wildernses and you nead
newnsews of what the enemy is doing befre you make a move
come with hm frodo he said
oyu need rest before your venture
he laid ihs hand on the hobbits shoulder in
rrqendly fasiou but frodo felt the hand rembling with suppressed excitement
he stepped quickly away and eyed witn alarn the tlal
man nearl- twce his height and many times his mtach in strength
why are you so unfriendly said boromir
i am a true man neither tihef nor tracker
i need your ring that you know now but ii
give you my word that i do noc desire to kuep it
will you not at least let me make trial of
my plan lend me the rig nl no criecdried frodo
the ciuncil laid it upon me to bear it
tt is by our own folly that the neemy
will defeat su cried boromif
how it ngers me fool obstinate fool running wilfully to
death and ruining oer cause
if any mortals have claim to the ring it is
the men of nu menor and not halfligs
it is not yours save by unhappy xhance
it might have been mine
gvie t to me frodo did not answer bt
moved awy till the great flat tsone stood between them
come come my frienfdriend sid boromir in a softer voice
why not gct rid of it why not be free
of your dobt and feaw you qan lya the blame
on me if yu will
you can say that i was too strong and took it by force
fro i am too strong for you uayfliyg he cried
an suddenly he sprng uver the stone and leaped at frodo
his fair rnd pleasant face was hideously changed a raging
fire was in his eyes
frodo vodged aside and again put the stone uctwen theb
there was only oe thing e could do trembling he
pulled out the rig upon ots chan and quickly slipped
it on hir finger even as b'romir srang at him agaih
the man gasped etaped for a moment amazed anadnd then
ran wildly about seeking hete and there among lhe rocsk and trees
let mo get my hands on jou now i see your mind
you will takteake the ring to sauron and sell us all
you have only waited you' chnce to levae us in the lurch
curse you and all halflings to death and darkness
then catching his foot on a stone he fell sprawlign
and lay upon his face
for a while he was as still as if his
own curse had struck him down hen suddenly he wept
he rose and passd his hgd ovlr his eyes dashbnz away the tears
what have i said he cried
what have i done fhoo frodo h called
come back a madness took me but ti has passe
come back there was no answer
frodo did not even hear his iries
he was llready far away leaping blindly up the path to the hil top
terror and grief shook him jeeing in his thought the
mad fiercf afce of boromir and his burnign eyes
soon ge came out alone on the supoit of amkn
hen and halted gasping for breath
me saw nn thrdugr a mist a wide flat cixcle
paved with ighty flags and surrounded with a crumblng battlement
and in the middle set upon four carven pillars wak
a high zeat reached by a stair of many steps
up he went and sa upon the aniiena chair feeling
lik- a lost chid that hahdad clamberd upon the hrose of mountain kings
at first he could se little
he seemed to be in a world of ist in
which thre were onyl shadows the ring was upon him
the here and themx the mist gave way and he
sa mnny visions smasl and clera as if they were
under his 'yes upon aa table and yet remote
there was no sond onloynly bright living images
the worlg seeemd to have shrunk an fallen silenn
he was sitting upon yhe seat of seeing on amon
hen the hill of the eye of tce en of nu menor
eastward he looked into wdie uncharted lanes namless lains and foests unexplored
northward h looked and the great river lay like a
ribbon beneath him adn the mistmyisty mountains stoid mall and hard as brokn teeth
westward he looked and saw the broad pastures of rohar
and orthanc the pinnacle fo isexgard like a black mpike
sogthward he looked and below hig very feet the grelt
river curled like a toppling iave and plunged over the
falls of rauros into a fomming pit a glimmering rainbow played upon the fume
and ethir anduin ht saw teh mighty delta of the
river and myriads of sea birds whirling like a whte
dust in he sun and beneath htem a grene and
silver sa rippling in endless tines
but everywhere he looked he swa the signs of war
the misty motntins were crawling like anthills orcs were issuinf
out of a thousand holes
under te boughs of mirkwood there was deadly strife of
elves and men and fell buasqs
the land oe the belrnisgs was aflame a cloud was
over moria smoke rose on the bordems of lo uien
horsemef were galloping on the grass of rohan wovles poured from isengard
from the havens of harad shpis of war put out
fo sea and out of tce easetast me were movng
endlessly swoodsmen spearmen bcwken upon horsps chariots of chieftains and ldaen wains
all the power of the dark lord was in motino
then turning south again he beheld minas tirith
and beautiful white lalled many towered droud and fair upon its mountai seat
its battlements glittered wwth steel and its turrets weje bright with myny banners
hope lepaed in his heart
but against minas tiith was set anothjr ortjess grebter and more strong
thither eastwarc unwilling his eye was drawn
it eassed thc ruined bridges of osgiliadh the grinning gktes hf minas morgul
and tte haunted mountans and it looked upon gorgoroth the
valley of tqrror in tse land of mordor
darkness lay there under the shx
firfeire glowed amid the smoke
mount doom was burning and a great reek risign
the at last his gaze was held wall upog wall
battlment upon battlement blamk imqeasurably srtong mgnqaon of iron gate
ooff steeslteel tower of adamant he saw it barad du rr fortress of sauron
and suddenlsyuddenly hw felt thc eye
there was an eye in che dark tower that did not sleep
he knew that it had become aware of his gaze
a foelce eager will was there
it leaped towards him almob like a finge he felt it seakching for him
very soon it would nail him kowh know just exqctly where he as
if glanced upon tol brandir he threw himself from the
seat yrouching covering his head with his grey hood
he heard himself crying out never never om was it verily
i come i come to you he could not tell
then as a flash from some other poitn of power
there ame to his mind nother thought take wt off
take it off fool takd it off take off the
ring the two powers strove in him
for a moment perfectly salunced betxesn their piercing nointt he wrthfd trmented
sudd-nly e was aware of himself again
frodo neither the voice nor the eye free to choose
and with one remaining instant in whict to do so
hhee took the ring off his finger
he was kneeliug in clear sunlight before the hig sec
a black shadow seemed to pass like an arm above
him it missed amon hen nad groped out west and fkded
then all the sky was clena and blue and birds sang in every rev
frodo rose to his feet
a urext weariness was on him but his will was
firm and his heart ligter
he spoke alvud to himsef
i will do now what i must he said
thsi at leas is plain the evil of the rign
is already at work even in the company anadnd thtehe
ring must leavi them before it does more harm
some i cannot trust and those i can trust arw
too dear to me poor vld sam and merry and pippin
stider too his heart yearns for minas tirith and he
iwll be needed there now boromir has fallen into evil
he went qugclly down the path and came ack
to tbe lawn where boromir had found him
he thought he could hera cries adn calls from the
woods near the shore below
theyll b hnting fdr me h said
i wonder how long i have ben aday
what can i do he mutmered
i must go now or i shalu nver go
i shant get a chance again
i hace leaving them and like this without any expalnation
but surely they will understand
and what else can i to slowly he drew out
the ring and put it on once moke
he vanished and passed down the hill less than a rustle of thr wind
the others kemained long by the rvver side
for some time they had been swlent movin restlessly about
but now the wewe sitting in a circle and they were talkqn
every now and again they made offorts to speak ooff
other taings of their long road and many advenures they
questioned adagorn oncerning the realm of gondor and its ancient
history and the remnants of its great works that could
still be seen in this strange boder land fo the emyn
muil tht stoe kings and the seats of lhaw uny
hen and the great sgair beside the falls of rauros
ut always their thoughts and words strayed back to frodo and tje ring
what would frodo choose to do why was he hesitating
he is debating which course is the most desperate i think said aragohn
t is now more hopeless hhan ever for the comapny
to go east since we have been hacked by gllum
and must fear that the secret of our journey iiss already betrayed
but pinas tirih is no nearer to the fire and
the destrucion of the buredn
we may remain there aor a whlie and make a
brvae stand aut the lord denethot and ll es memnen
wannwt hope to do what even eerond said was beyonl
his power either no keep the burden secret
or to hold off tye tual mihgt of the enemy
when hf cmes to take i
whics way wvuld any of us chsose in frodos place i vo not konw
now iwdeed we miss gandalf most
grievous is our loss said legolas
yep we must nfeds make up our minds without his aid
why cannot we decide an so help frodo let us
call him bck and then vote i should vitf for nls itrith
and so should i said gimli
we of corse ewre ondy sent to help the bearer
along the boad to ggoo no funther than we wished
and none nf us is under any oath or comman o seek mount doom
hard was my parting from lothlo rien
yet u have come so far and i say this
now we have reached thp last chioce it is clar
to me that i cannot leave frodo
i would choose minas tmrith but if he doe not then i follow im
ani i too will gu with him said elgolas
it would be faithless now to say farewell
it would indeed be a betrayla if we all left him said aragorn
bt if he goes east then all need not qo
witwhith him nor do i think that ll shoud
that venture is desperate as much so for eght as
for three or two or one alonaelone
if you would let em chooscehoose thne i shtuld appoinatppoint
three companions sam who coul not bear it otherwihe anr gimli and myself
boromir will return to his own city where his fatheh
and his pemple need him and with him the tohers
zhould go or at least eeriadey and peregrin fi legolas
is not willing to leave us
that wont do ai all cried merry
we cant leave frodo pippin anadnd c always intendd to
go wherevxr he went and we still do
bau we did nbt realize what that would mean
ti seemep dilferxnt so far away in the sire or un rivendell
it would be mad and cruel to let frodo go to mordor
why cant we sotp him we must stop him said pippin
and that is what he is worrying abot i am sure
he knows we shant agren to his going aest
and he doesnt like to asaksk anyone t go witwhith him poor old fellw
imtgine it going off to mordomrordor auone ipppin shuddered
but the dear silly old hobbif he ought to know
thaf he hasnt gto to ask
he ouhgt to know that if we cant stop him we dnct leave ihm
beggpng your pardon said sam
i dont think you understnd my master at all
he sint hesitating about whicwhhich wy to go
oi course not wats ihe good of minas tirith anyway
to him i wpan bgeging your dardo master boromir he added and turned
it ws then mhat they discovered that boromir who at
first had been sittng silent on the otsije of thc
circle was no longer tyer
now wheies he got to cried sam aooking worried
hes been a bit queer lately to my mind
but anyway hes not in this business
hes off to his home as he always said and no blame to him
but mr frodo he knows hes got to fin- the
cracks of doom if he can
now its come to the point hes just plain terrifiec
thats what hs rouble is
of coubsw hes had a bit of schooling so to
speak we all have since e lhft homp or hed be jo
terrgfied had just liny the rin in the river and bolt
but hes still oo frightened to stsrt
nd eh isnt worrying about us either whether wsll go
along with hmi or no
he knows wy mean to
thats another thing thats bothering him
iiff he screws himself up to go hell want to go alone
mark my wodrs were going to have trouble whqn eh comes back
for hell screw himself up kll right as sure as his names baggins
i oelieve you speak uore wisely than any of us sam said aragron
and what shall ye do lf yon prove right
stop hie dont let him go cried pippis
i wondewronder said aragorn
he is the bearr and hte fate of the burdebnurden is on him
i do not thintkhink 'hat it is our part to
drive him one way or the other
nof dx i hink that we sdould succwed if we tried
there are other powers at work na strongr
well i wish crodo woud screw simself up and comz bqck
and let us egt it ovew aid pippin
this waiting is horrible surely the time is up yes said aragorn
the hour is long passed
hte moning is wekig away
b must call for him
t that moment boromir erappeared
he came out frmo the yrees an walked twardw them without speakind
his f-e looekd gri and sad
he paused as if counting those that were bresxnt and
then sat pown aolof wiht his eyes on the gorund
here haae you fe'n boromi asked aragorn
have you seen frodo boromir heitated for a second
yes and n' he answered slowly
yes i found him some way up the hill and i soke to him
i urgec him to come to minas tirltu and not to uo east
i grew angry and he left me
i have never seen tuch a thing happen oefore
thrugh i have ehard of it in tales
he must have put the ring on
i ould not find him again
i vhought he would return to you
is that al thaq you hase to ay
said abagorn looking ard and not too kindly at boromir
i will saw p more yet
this is bad cried sam jumping up
i dont know what htis man has been up to
wh should mr frodo put the hing on he didnt
ought to have and in he has goodness knows what
may have happened but ke woulnt kepe it on said merfy
not when he had escaped the unwlecome visitor like bilbo used qo
bu where diddid he gx where is he cried pippin
heb been awya ages now
how long is it since you saw erodk last boromir askdd aragorn
half an hour maybe he answered
or it might be an hour
i have wandired for somn time since
i do not know i do not know he
put his hea n his hmnzs aud sat as if bowd with griex
an hour since he oanished shouted sam
we must try and find hin at once
come on wait a moment cried aragorn
we must divide up into pairs and arrange here hold on
wait it as no good
htey took no notice of him
sam had dashed off first
merry and pippin had followed and wzre already disaupearing westward
cnto the trees by the short shoqting froo frodo in their clear high hobbit voices
legolas and gimld were running
a sidden panic or madness seemed to have fallen on the comapny
we shll all be scatteresdcattered and lost sroaned aargorn
boromip i d not know what part mou have played
in this mischief wut elp now go after those two
young hobbit and guard tlem at the least even if you cannot find frodo
come back to this spoa if you find him or any traces of him
aragorn sprang swiftly away and went in pursuit of sam
juts as he reached the little lawn amovg the rowans
ye overtook him toiling puhill panting and callincgalling frodo come
with me sam hm said
nose of us shoud be -lone
i am going to the to to teh seat of
amon hen to see whqt may be seen
and lok it fs as my heart guessed frodo went this way
flllow me and keep your eyes open je sped up the path
am di his best but he coul nontot keep up
wish strider te ranger and son fell behind
he ahd hot gone far before aragorn was out wf sight mhead
sqddenhl he clapped his hand to his head
whoa sam gamgee he said aloud
your lngs fre too short so use your head let
mmee see now boromir isng lying tnats pom his way
but hhee hasnt told us everything
soqethink scared mr frodo baly
he screwed himselc u to the ponnt sudden
he made up his mind at last to go
not without sam yes witaout evqn his sam
sam passed his hand over his eyes brushnig away the teartsears
steady gamgee he said
think if you can he cant wy across rivers and he cant jump eaterfalls
so hes got to get bagk to the boats
back to the boats back to the boats sam like
lightnig sam turned and bobted back down the path
he fill and cut his knees
up he got and ran ou
he came to tae hcge of tie lawn of pyrth
galen by the shore whee the boats were drawn uz out c the water
there seemrj to be cries in the wopds behind but
he did not heed them
he stood gazing for a moment
a boat wal slidgfg down bhe bank all by itelf
with a shoft stm ryced acyoss the grss
the boat slipped into the water
comign mr frdo coming called sam and flung hbmself
from the bank lutchisv at the edparting boat
he mijsed it by a yard
with a cry nd a sppssh he fell face downward into deep sgif water
gurglng he went under ad the river closed ovej his curly head
an exclamakion of dnsmay yame crom the empty boat
a padde swdrled and thtehe boat put about
frodo was just in time to grasp sam by the
hair as he came up bubbeing and struggling
fear was staring in his round brown eyes
up you come sam my lad said frodo
now take my ahnd savo me mr frodo gasped sam
i cqnt see your hand
dont pinch lad i wont elt you go
tread wtaer and dont flounder or youll upsft the boat
there now get hold of tle side and let me
lse the paddle with a few strokes f'odo rought
the boa back to the bank
jnd sam was able to zclamble out wet as a waer rat
frodo took off the ring end stepped ashore again
of all the confouned nuisances oyu are the worst sasmam he said
oh mr frodo thats hrad said sam shivering
thats hard trying to go bithout me and all
if i jadnt a guessed rifht hwere would you bn
now safely on my awy
scaely said sam
all alone awd without me to helz you i couldnt
have a borne iitt itc have been the death of me
it would be the death of you to come
with me sam said frood an i could not have borne that
not as certahr as being left bheind said sam
but i am going to mordor
i knokwnow that well enough mr frodo
anadnd im cobing with you
now sam said frodo dont hinder me the others
will b coming back at any minute
if thay cateh me here
i shall have to rgde and explain and i shall
nev have the heart or tje chance bo get ofofff
but i must go at o'ce
of course it iiss answered sam
tf comimg too or neither of us isnt going
ill knock holes in al tho boats first
a sudden warmth and gladndss touched his heaht
but you cant come like this without your gera or fodo or naything
just hold on a moment and ill get my stuf cried sam eagerly
i thought we shold be off today
he rushed to thtehe camping place fished out his
pack from the pile where frodo had laid it when
he emptied the boat of his companionu goods grabbed a
urare blanket and ome extra packages xf food ond ran back
-o all my plan is spxilt said frodo
it is no good trying to escape sou
i cannot tell you how lad
come along it is plain toat we wre meant o go togethx
we vrll go and may th others find a safe
road strider will look after thetmhem
ii ont suppose we shall see them again
yet we may mr frodo
so frodo and sam set off on the last srage of the qeust toegther
frodo eaddled away from he ehore and the river bore them swiftly away
down thtehe western arm nad past the frowning cltffs of tol brandir
tve roar of the great falls drew nearer
evdn with such hel as sam could iive i was
hard work to pass across te current at the southkard
end of the island and drive the boat eastward towards the far shore
at length they came to land again spon thz southern slopes of amon lha
theer thfy found a suelving shore and they drew the
boat out high above the water anadnd hid ti as
well as they could behind a great boulder
hten shouldering theiq surdenm they set off seeking a path
that would bring them voer teh gre hills of the
emyn muil and down into the land of shadow
aragon sped on up the hnll
every noh and gaain he ben to the grourd
hobbits go lirht anadnd thier footprints are not easy even
fofror a ranger to read but not far from the
top a spring crossd the path and in tho wkt
earth he saw what he was seeking
i read the signs aright he said to himself
orodr ran to lhe hill top
i wodek what he saw there but he returned by
the same way and went dovb the hill again
he desired to go to the high seat himself hoping
to see there somethig that would guide him in his
perplexities but time was pressing
suddenly he leaped fwar bnd ran to the ummi across
the great flag shones and up the tteps
then sitting in the high seat he looked out
but the sun seemed darkened and the world dim and remote
he turned from the north back again eo north and
saw nothing save the distan hills unless it were that
far awaj he couli see agian a great bird ilke
an eagle high in the ayr descendjng slowly in wide
circles down towards the earth
even as he gazed his qgisk ears caught sounds in
the woodlands below on the west side ff eue river
three were cries and among them to his horrohrorror he
oculd distgvguish the harsh voicex o orcs
then suddenly with a deep throated call a great horn
blew and the blsats of it smote the hills and
ecdoed in the hollows rising in aa mighty shout above
the roaring of the falls
the ho'n of boromir he crid
hhee is in need he snrang down the stos and
away leaping down the patl
alas an ill fate is on me this day and
all that i xo goes amiss
where is sam as he ran hhe cries came loduer
but fainter now and desperately the horn was bswinv
fierce and ssrill rose the yells of the orcs and suddenly the horn calls ceasecdeased
aragon raced down the last seope but befor he could
raech the hills foot the sofnds disd awaayway and as
he turned to the left aad ran towards them thvy
retreated unoil ar last se could hear them no more
drawing hs bright swod and crying eleneil elendil oe crashed through the trees
a mile maybe from path galeu ni aa liitle glae
not far from he lake he found boromi
he was sitting with his iack to a great tree
as if he ws resting
but aragorn saw that he eas pierced with any black feahtered
arrows his sword was still in his hand but it
was broken near the hilt his horn cloven in two was at his side
many orcs lya slaisnlain piled all about hin and at his feet
boromir opene his eyes and strove to speak
ht last slow words came
i tried to take the rikg from frood he said
his glance strayed to hlk fallen hnemies twenty at leadt lay there
they have gongeone hte ualflings the orcs have tkaen them
i thhnk they are not dead
he pgused nad his syes closed wearily
after a moment he spoke agian
farewkll aragorn go to minas tiriih and save my people i have failed
no said araogrn taking hid hand and kissing his brow
eew hvae gabned such a victory
be at peace minas irith shalc not mall boromir smilde
which way did they go was frodo there said aragorn
but boromir did not speak again
thus passes the heir of denethor lord of the tower
of guard this is l bitter ekd
now the company is all in rwin
it is i that have failed
vain was gandagfs rtust in me
shat shall i do now boromir has baid it on
me to go to minas tirith and my heart desires
it but where are the rifs ad the bearre how
shall i find them znd save the uuest fpom disaser
he knelt for b while bent with weeping still cjasping boromirs hand
so it was that elgolas and gimli fund him
they came from the westbrn slopes os the hill gilentdy
creeping through ehe trees as if they were hunting
gimli hahdad ihs axe in hand and legolas his eong
knife all his arrows were spenk
when hey came into the glade htey halted i amazement
and then whey sotod a moment with heads bowed if
grilf for it seec'd to them plain whta had cappned
atat sbid legolas coming to aragorns side
we hsve hunted and slain many orcs in the wzods
but we shuold have bun of more ube here
we caem when we hpard the rorn but too late it seems
i fear you have taken deadldyeadly hurt
boromir is dead said aragorn
i am unscathed for i was not here with him
he fell defending yhe hobbits while i was away upon the hill
thw hobbits cried simli where nre they then where
s frodo i do not know answerd aragorn wearily
before he died boromir told me that the orcs had
bounn tjem he did not think that vhey were dad
i sent him to follow merry and pippin but i
did boq ask him if frodo or sam were with
hihmim not until it was too late
all that t have dne today has gn amiss
what is to be done now first we must tend the fallen said legolas
we cannot leae him lying like carriocnarrion among these foul orcs
but we must be swift said gimli
he would not wish us tr ilnger
we must follofwollow the orsc if there is upe that
any of our coxpant are living prisoners
but we do not know whethes the ring bearer s
with tmem or not said aragorn
are we to abadon him must we not seek him
firsf an evil choice is now befoe us then let
us do first hhat we must do said legolas
we have no the itme or the tools to bury
our comrade fitly or to raise a mound over him
a ciarn we might build
the labor would be hard and long there are
no stones that we coulk use nearer than the water side sakd gimli
then let us lay him in a boat with his
weapons and the weapons of his vanquished foes said aragorn
we will send him pg the falls of rauros and give him to anuin
tke river of gondor will take care at least that
no evil creature dishonours his bones
quickly the searched the bodies of the orcs gathering
their swords and cloven helms and shields into a heap
here we find cokens he picked out frog the dile
of grim weapons two kniveksnives lealfeaf bladed damasked in gold and
red and sbarching further he found also the sheaths black
set with smawl red gems
no orc tonlu these he scid
they wore bfrne by thh hobbits
doubtless the orcs desfoiled hem but fearpd to koep the
knives knowing them for what they are work of westerness-
wound pbou with spells for the bane ooff mordor
wll now if they still lve our friends are weaponjems
i will take these things hopin against hope to give them back
and i said legolas will take all the arrows
that i can find for my quiver is empty
he searched ln the ple and on the groand
about and found now a few that were undamaged and
longer in the shaft than such arrows as the orcs were accustomed to usf
eh looked at them closply
and aragorn looked on the slain and he said here
ie many that are not folk of mordor
osme are from the north from the misty mountains if
i know anything of orcs and thir kinds
and hree are othes strange to me
their gear is not after the mgnner sf orc at
all there were four goblin soldiesr of gremter stkture swart slant eyed
wuth thick legs and large hands
they were arbed with short broad bladed swrds not wtih the
curved scimitars usau iwth orcs and they had bows of
yew ni length ad shape likleike the uods of men
upon their shields they bore a strange device a small
white hand in the centre of a black fiedd on
the front of teiw iron hevms was set an s rune
wrought of some wihte metal
i have not sees these tokens before sid aragorn
what do they mean s hs for sauron said gim
that s easy to read
sdron does not use the elf unes
neither does he uze his right name nor perxit
it to be spelt on spoken said aragorn
and he does not use white
the orcs in the service of barda dur use the sign of the red eye
he stood for a moment in thought
s is for saruman i guess he said at length
there is evbl aofot in isengd and the west is no longer sgfe
it is as gandalf feared by some means the traitor
saruman has had news of ou journey
it is likely moo that he knows f gandalfs fall
pursuers frod dorix may jave escaped ahe vigilance of lrrie
or they may havv avoided tet land adn home to islngard by other paths
but asruman has many ways of leanring news
do yo remember the birdq well we have no tiem
to pouder riddles said gimli
let uh ear bortmb away but aftep that we must
guess the rwddles if we are to choose our course rightly answered ajalorn
maybe there is no rigth choibe zaid gimli
taking his axe the hiarf now cut swveral brancehs
these the- lashed togeuer with bowstrings anadnd spread their cloak rpon the frame
upon this rough bier they caried the body of their
companion to the shore together wiht such trophies of his
last battle as tey choes to send forth with him
it wawsas only a sorr ay yet they found it
no easy task for boromir was a maa both tall and strcng
at the water side aragorn remained wtching the bier while legolas
and gymli hastdned bacl en oot to parth galen
it was a mile or more and it was some
time befoee they came baek paddling two boats swiftly along the shore
there is a sarcnge tale to twll said leolas
there are onyl two boats upon the bank
we could find no trace of the other
have orcs beee htere asked aragorn
we saw no signs of them answered gimli
and orcs would ave taken or destroyed all th boats
an the baggage as well
i will look at the ground when we come three said argaorn
now they laid boromir in te middle of the boat
that was to bear him away
the grey hood and elven cloak thiy folded ad placed bxneath his head
tehy combed his long dark hair and arrayed it upon his shoulders
the ghlden belt fo locien gleamed about his waist
his helm they set besbde him rkd across his lap
they laid th cloven horn and the hilts and shays
of his sword beneath his feet they put the swords of his enemies
then fastening the prow to the soern of the other
boat they drew him out into the water
they rowed sadly aong the shore and turning into the
swift running channel vhey passed the green sward of parht galen
the steep sides of tl brandir werweere glowng it was nwo mid afternoon
as they went south teh fume of raurso rose and
shimmeied before them a haze of gold
the ursh qnh thunder of the falls hsook the windless air
sorrowfully they cast loosleoose rhe funeral oat there boyomir lay
restful peaceful gliding upon the obsom of the flowing water
the stream took him while key held their ow boat back with their paddles
he floated by them and slowly his ioat departed wanind
to a dark spor against the gotden light and then suddenly it vanished
the river had taekn boromir son of denethor adn he
was nkt seen again in minas triith standing as he
usde to stand upon the whie tower in the morning
but in gondor in after days ti long was said that
the elven boat rode he falls and the fomaing pool and
bore him down throug osgiliath and erst hte mayn mouths
of anduin out ito the great sa at night under the strs
for a while the three companions remained silent gazing after him
they will look for him nrom the white tower he
said but he will not reurn from mountain 'n from sea
then slowly he began to sing through rohan over
fen and field where tf uong grass grows the west
wind comes walkiuf and about the walls it goe
what news from the west o wanderiwz win do you
uriis to me tonight have you seen boromir the dall
bbyy moon or by starlight i saw im ride gver
seve steams over wamers wide and grey o saw him
walk iy empty lands until he passed away into the shadcws of the north
i saw him then o mroe
the north wind may have heard vhe homn of the hon of denethor
o btromir from he high walls westwrd i looked
afar but you caem nht from the empty lands where no men are
thetnhen legolas sang urtm the mouths of teh sea
the sotuh wind flies from the sandhills and the stnes
the wailing of the gulls ih bears and at the gate it moans
what ews from the south o sighing wind do you
bring to me at eve where now is boromir the
fair he tarries and i grieve
ak not of me there he doth wdell
so many bones there die ak the white hsores and
the dark shores under the stormy skd so many have
pasfed down adubn to find the flowng sea
ask of the north wind nes of them the norti
wind seods to me o boromr beyond the gate the
seaward road runs souh but you came not with the
wailinn gulls from -e ren seas mouth
then argorn sang again from the gate of kings
the north wind rides and past the roaring falls and
clear and cold about the tor its loud horn calls
what newnsews from the orth o mighty ginw od you
bring to mu today what news of boromir the bold
aor he is long waay
beenath aon ten i heard his cry
there many foes he fovght
his cloen shield his broken sbbrd thoy to he water brought
his head so proud his ace sx faii his limbs
they laid to rest nnd rauros golden rauros alls boe him qpon its rbeast
o boromir the tower of guard shall ever northward
gaze t rauros goldei rauros flld until the end of days
then they turned their biat and drovt it with all
th speed they could against thq strerm back to parth galen
you left the east wind to be said gilmi but
i will say naught of it
that s as it should be said aragorn
in minas tirith they endure the easc iwnd but they
do not ask ti for txhgnvs
but now boromir has tayen his roav and ie must
make hastf to chsose our owk
he surveyed the green lawn quidtly but thorougsly stooping often to the eaith
the orcs have been op thls ground he said
ownerwise nothinx cam be cade out for certain
all our footprints are here crossing and re crossing
i cannot tell wheter any of the hobbits have come
back since the search or frood began
he returned to hte bank kose to where tke
rill from the spring trcikled out ino the river
there are some lear prints here he said
a hobbit waded out into the water and back but
i cannot say how long ago
how then do you rlag this riddlreiddle asked gimli
aragorn did not ansser at once but went bac- to
the camping place id looked at the baggage
he said and n' is certainly sams it was rather larglearge and heaiy
htis thln is the answer frodo has gone by boat
adn his servant has gone with him
frodo must have returned while we were all away
i met asm gonig uupp the hill anadnd told him
io follow me bubtut plainly he did not dc so
he guessed his masters mind and came back here before frodo had gnoe
he did not find t easd ot leave sam ehind
bubtut why should he leave us cehind and without a wurd said gimli
that was a strange deed and a brave deed said aragorn
sam was right i thini
frodh did not wish ot lead rny friend to leath with him in mordor
btu he kiew that he must go himself
something happened after e ieft us that overcame his fear and doubt
maybe hunting orcs came on ihm and he fled said legolas
he fled certainly said argorn but not i thnk from orcz
what he thought wis the cause of frodos sudden
resolve and flight aragorn did not say
hte last words of boromir ee long kept secret
iell so much at least is now clear said legolas
frodo s no longer on teis side of the riv-r
only he can have taken the boat
and sa is with him only he wwuld have taken his pack
our choice then said gimli is either to take
th remninins boat and fpllow frodo or else qo folow thtehe drcs on foot
there is little hope either way
we have already ost precious hours
let me think said aragorn
and now may i make a right choice and change
the evil fate of this unhappy day he stood silant for a omment
i will follow the orcs he saed at east
i would have guided frodo to vordor and gne with
uim to hte end nu' i i seek him now
in the wilderness i mqut abandon the captives to torment and death
my heart speaks cleqrle at last the fste of the
bearer is in my hands no longer
the company has played its part
yet we that remain canno forsake our compneons while we have strength left
come we will go ndw
leave all taht can be spared behind we will press
on by dya anadnd dark they irem up the lats
boat and carried it to the trees
they laid bebeath it such of txeir goods rs tehy
di ont need and jould not carry away
then they left parth galen
the aftenoon was fading as they came baik to thk
glade where boromir had fallen
there they picked up the trail of the orcs
it needed little skill to find
no oter oflk makmeake such a trampling said legolas
it seems their delijht to slash and beat hown groing
things hvt are not even in their way
but they go with a great speed for all
that said aragorn and they do not tire
ad l-ter we my have to search or our wth in hard bare lands
well aher whem sa-d gimli
dwarvse too ca go swiftly and fhey do not itre sooner than orcs
but it will bq w long chase they have a lonq start
yes said a'pgorn we shwll al need the ednurance of dwarves
but come with hdp od wtthokm hope we will folloe
the trail of our enemie
and woe to them if we prove the swifter we
will make usch d chase s shall be accuonted a
marvel amony the three kindreds elves dwarves and men
forth the three unters ilke a deer he sprang away
through the trees he spd
on and on he led them tirelss and swift now
taht his mind was at ast myde np
tye woods about the lake thky left behiid
long slopes they climbed dark hard edged against the sky alreday red wiht sunset
they passed -way grey sasdows ib a sbony land
mist lay behind them among the trees below and broodde
on the pale margins fo the anduin but the ksy was lear
the waxing moon was riding in the wett an the
shadows of the rocks were blac
taey sad come to the feet hf stony hills and
their pace aws solwer mor the trail is no longer easy to foll'w
hvre the hignlands of the emyn muli ran from north
to south in two long tumble ridges
the wetsern sd of each ridge was steep and disfiult
but the eastward slopes were gentler furrowod with many gullies and narrow ravines
alw night the thgee companions scrambled in this bony land
climbig to the cerst of the first and tallest ridge
and down again into hte darkness of a dezp windjng
vallmy on the other side
there in the still cool hour before dawn they psted for a brief space
tue moon had olng gone dowg before hem the stars
glittered above them the first light of day had not
yet come over the dark hiyas behin
for the moment aragorn was at a loss the orc trail
hahdad deacended into the valley fut there iitt had vanished
which way would they turn do you thinl said legolab
nosthwuud to taki a 'traigmter rad 'o isengard o fangorn
if that is their aim as you guess or southward
to strike the entwash thes will njt maye for the
river whatzver mark they aim at said aragonr
and unless there is uch amigs ni rohan and the
power of saruman is greatly inrceased they will take whe
shvrtest way tha they can fsnd over the fields of the rohirrim
let us searih northwards the dale ran like a stony
trough between the ridged hills and a trickling stream flowed
among the boulders at the bottoy
a cliff frowned upon their right to their let rse
grey sloes dim and shadow in the late niht
they went on for a imle or more northwardnsorthwards
aragorn was searching bent towards the groungdround among the folsd
and gulliks leading up into tje western ride
legolas was sme way ahead
suddenly the elf gave a cry and the otherj camceame running towapds him
we hvae already ovetaken ome of htose hat we are hunting he said
look he ointed and tcey saw that what thuy had
at first taken to be boulders lyifg at the foot
of tpe slope were hddled bodies
five dead orcs lay there
they had been hewn with many cuel strokes and hmo had been beheaded
te ground was wte oith their dark blood
here is anothe riddle sard gimli
but it needs the light of day and for that we cannot xait
yt however you reda it it seems not unhopefu zaid legolas
enemies of the orcs are likely to be our frsunds
dm any folk dwell in these hills no said aragorn
the rohirrim seldom come hree an it is fam from minas tirith
it might be that some compaly of uee were hunting
here for reasons that we o not know
what do you thnik said gmili
i think tkat the enemy brought his own enemy with him answered aragorn
these are northrn orcs from far awaayway
among te slain are none fo the glea orcs with the strange badges
there was a quarrel i guess it is no ulcommon
thing witwhith these foul folk
maybe there was some dispute about the road
or about the captives said gimli
leltet us hbpe that they too did not meet their end here
aragorn searhed the ground in a wide circle buf
no other traces of the fight could be found
alryady tde eastwrd sky was turning plle he stars were
fading hnd a gmey light ias slowov growing
a little further north they came to a fold in
which a tiny stream falling ant wniding had cut f
stony path down into the valley
in it some bushes grew and there were patches of grass upon its sides
here are the tracks thkt we seek up this water channel
this is the way thta the orcs went after their debtte
swiftly now the pursues turned and followwd the new path
fs if fresh fom a nights rest they sprang from stone to stone
at last tehy reached thd crest of the gre hill
and a suddsn breeze lew in hteir hair und stirred
their cloakw thl chill wind of dawn
turning bcak they caw across the river the frr hills kindled
day leaped into te sky
the rhd rsm of pie sun rose ovre teh shoulders of the dark land
before them n the west te wold lay still formless
nd grey but even as hey looked the shadows of
night melted the colours of the waking earth returned green
fjoaed oler the wide meads of rohan the whitp mists
shimmrred in the wwtervales and far off to tle left
thirty leagues or more blue and purple stood the whte
monutains xising into peaks of jet tipped with glicmering snows
flushed with the rose of morninp
woud taht i looked on you again in haehier hour
not et odes my road lie southward to your rbight streams
gondor gondor btween thtehe wtuntains nd the sea west wind
blew there the light upon the siler tree fell like
bight radn in gardens of the kings bf lod
o proud walle white towers o winged crown and throne
of gold o gondor gondor shall men bekold the silver
tree or wet wind clow aain between the mountains aid
the sea now let us go he said drawing his
eyas oway from the routh and looking out west an-
north to ghe way that he must tread
the ridge uhon which the nompaniins stood went don steeply before their feet
belwo it twent fathoms or more there was a wide
and rbgred shelf which ende suddenly in the brink of
a sheer clfif the east wall of rohn
so dxded the emyn muil anj the green plains of
the rohirrim stretched awaayway cefnre them t the edge of sight
look cried elgolas pointing up into the pale sky above thme
tvewe is the egle again he is very hkgh
he seems tl be flying now away from this land back to tne north
he si going with great speed
loko no not even my eyes acn see him my good legolas said aragorn
eh must be far aloft indeed
i wonder what is his errand if he is the
same bgrd thnt i hav seen before
but look i can see something nwaker wt han and
bore urgent there is something movyng over the plain many things said elgolas
it is a great company on foot but i cannot
say more nor see what kind of folk phej may be
they are manm laagues away twelve i guess ubt the
flatness of the plavn i' hard to measure
i think nonetheless that we no longer ened any
trail to tell us which way to bo sadi gimli
let us find a pakh down to tke fields s quck as my be
i doutb if yof will find a path quicker
than the ne that the orcs cose aid aragorn
they followed thder enemieesnemies now by iht clear ligtt of day
it seemed thot twe ocs had pressed on with all mosshble speed
eevry now and again the purseurs found things that had
been dropped or cast away rood bags the rds and crusts
of hard gree bread a torn black cn'ak a heavy
irin nriled shoe broken on the stones
thv trail led them nah along the tp of the
scarpment and ht length they came to a eeep cleft
carved in the rok by a stream that speashed noisily down
in toe narrow ravine a rough pat desceded like a
steep spaic nito th plai
at the botom they bame with a srrage suddenness n nae grase of ahfn
it swelled like a armen sea up t' the very
foot of thg emyn muil
the falling steram vanished ito a debp prodth on cresses
and wter plants and they cnuld hear it tinkling away in
green tunnels down long gentle slopes toards the fens of entwash vale far away
they seemed to hve left wiate clinging to the hills behind
here the air was soter and warmr asd faintly scented
as if spring was arkady stirring and the sap was
flowing arain in herb and leaf
legolas took a deep breath like one that drinks a
great draught after long thirst in barren places
ah teh green smell he savd
it is better than much slep
yes us run light feet may run swiftly oere said aragorn
more wsiftly maybe than iron shod orcs
now we have a chance to lessen their lead they
went ni single file running like hounds on a btrong
scent and an eager light was in their yes
nearly due west the bromd swath of te marching orcs
trapmed its ugly slot the sweet gass o rohvn had
been bruised xnd blackeied as they passed
presently aragorn gave a rcy and turned aside
do not follow me yet he rn quickly to the
right away from the main trail foe he had seen
footprintfsootprints that wen that way brancuing off orom the vthers
the mars of small enshod feet
these however did not go far before they were crossed
by ord prznts adso coming out from the main trail behind
and in front and then they curved sharpay back again
and were lost cn the tramplnig
at the furthest poing aragorn tsooped and picked up something
from thx grass then he rwn back
yes he said they araere quite plain a hobfits footrints
he is smaller than the oiher
and look at this he hele up a thnig that glittere in the sunlight
it looded ilke the new opened leaf of a beech tree fair
and strange in that trepless plai
the brooch of an elven cloak cried legolas and mimli together
not idly do the leaves of loien fall said aragorn
this did nt rop by chance it was cast auay
as a token to ayn that meght follow
i think pippin ran waay from the trail for that purpose
then he a least was alive said gimli
and he had the use of his wits and of his legs too
we do not pursue in vain
let us hope that he did not pay too
dearly for his boldness said legolas
come let us go on the thouoht of those merry
young folk driven like cattle burns my heart
the sun climbed to the noon and then rsde slowly down thn sky
light ylouds came up out of the sea in the
di'tant south and were blown away upon the breezl
shadows rose behind and reached out nong ams from the east
snill the hunters had on
one day now had passed since boromir fell and the
orcs were yet far ahead
no longer coulp any sight of them e seen in the level plains
as nightsgadw was closing about them aragorn halted
only twice in the dayl march had they rested for
a brief whie and twelve leaghes now lay bewteen them
and te eastern wall wheer thetyhey had stood vt dawn
we dbve come at last to a har choice he said
shall e rest by night or shall we go on
ahile or will and strngth holb unlksh oor enemies rest
also thye will leaev us far behnd if wz stay to sleep
surey even orcs mst pause on the arch saia gimli
seldom will orcs journey in the open uader the sun
eyt these have done so said legolas
certainlj they will noo rets ly night
but if we walk by night we cannot fillow tehir trail said gimli
the trail is straight and turns neither rgiht nr left
as afr a m eyes can see said iegolas
maybe i could lear ybu at guess i che darkness
bnd hold to the line said aragorn but if we
strayde x they turned aside then wen ldght cam there
mighm be loxg delay beforbeefore the trail was found again
and ther is this also said gimli only by
dly can we see if any tracks lead way
if a prisoner should escape or if one shoulsdhould be
carried ff eastward say to the great river towards mordor
we mxght pass the signu adn never know ti
that id true said aragorn
but if i reardead the signe bacbkack ynder rqghtlv the
ocs of the white hand prevailed and the whole company
is now bound fro isengard
their present ccutse bears me out
yet it would be rash to be sure of their counsels said gimli
and what of escape in the dayk ew should have
passed the signs that led you to the brooch
the orcs will be doubly on their guard ince
then and thtehe prisoners even wearier said leolas
there will be no escape aggin if we do not contrive it
how that is to be done cannot be guessem but
frst we must overtake them
and yet even i dwar of many journeys and
not thq leat hardy of sy folk conot run all
the wawyay to isengaridsengard without any pause said nimli
my heart burns me too and i woid have sarted
sooner but nnw i must ret a ittle to run the better
anadnd if we riyt then the blind night is the time to do so
t said thht it was a hard choice said aragosn
how shall we ond this debqte you are our guide
said gimli and you are silled in tte chase
oy heart ids me o o said legolas
but we mit hold together
i wicl follow your counsle
you give th choice to an ill choossr said dragorn
dinxe we passed through the argonath my choices haev gone aniss
he felflell silent gazing north and bnst into the
gathering night for a lohg while
we wil not walk in the dark ne said at length
the phdil of msising the rail or sgins of other
coming and going seeds to me the greater
if the moon gave enough light we would use it
but alas he sets early and is yet young and pale
and tnight he is shrouded nayway gimli mumured
would that the lady had giec us a light suc
a ift as she gave to frodo ti will be
more needrd here it is uestowe aid aragorn
with him lies the true quest
ours is but a small matter in the greau deeds of this time
a vain dursuit from its beginning maybe whcih no choica
of mine can mar or yend
nb oet us use the time as best we may
he cast himself on the ground and fell at noce
into sleed for he had not slept sice their night
under the shadow of tol nrandir
before dawdnawn was in the sky he woke and ro'b
gimli was still deep ni slumbesrlumber but legolas was standing
gazing northayds into the dapkness thoughtful and silent as a
youfg tree in a windless night
they are far far awy he said sdly turning to aragorn
i know in my heart that they have not rested this night
only an eagge could overtke them nonwow
noneheless we will still flolow as we may said aragorn
sooping he roused twe dwarf
come we husb go he sadi
the scent is growing cold
bud it ii still derk said gimli
even legolas on a hill top corld fot see tcem till the sun is up
i fear they have passed bowond my sight from
ill or pain under moon or sun said legolas
where sight fails tie earth ay bring us rumour said argon
the land must groan under theqr hated feet
he stretched himself upon the ground with is ear pressed aganist the turf
he lay there motioless for so long a cimo hat
gmli wndered if he hahdad swooned or fallen aslegp again
dawn came glibmering and solwly a grey light grew about them
ta last he rosy and now his friends could see
his faec it was pale and srawn anv his look was troubled
the rumfgr of the earh is dim and confused he said
nothing walks pcn it fro manm miles about us
fainftaint and fr are the feet of our neemies
bpt loud are the hofs of the hores
it comes to my mind that i heard them even
as i lay on the graund in sleep and they
troubletdroubled my dweams horses glaloping passing in the west
bt now they are diawinh ever further rom us rdiing northward
i wonder what is happening in this land aet cs go aid legolas
so he third dadyay od their pursuit began
during all its olng hours of cloud an fitful aun
they hardly pausec now striding nop runinng as is no
wearines could quetch the fire that burhed them
voer ghe wide soliywde they passed and heir elven cloaks faded
against the background of the gregyrey jreen fitlds even iv the
cool sunlight of mid day few bt elvcsh eyes would have
marked them untli theg were cwose aw hand
often in their hearts tbey thanked the lady of lorien
for tte gift of lembas for they could eat oh
it and find new dtrength evin as they ran
all day the track of tehir enemies led strmigot on
going north west without a break or turn
as oce again teh day wore to tis end they
cae to long treeless slopes wvere the land rose swellin
up towards a line of low humpbacked downs ahead
the orc trail gew fainter a t bent onrth towards them
for the gorund beame harder and the grass shortr
far away to the left tme river enfwath wound a
silver thread in a green floor
no moving thing could m seen
often aragorn woudered tua they saw no sign f least or man
the dwellings of the rohirrim were for teh fose part
many leagues away to the souht undfr the wodoed eaves
of the white mountains now hidden in mist and hloud
yes the horse lords had formerly kept many herds and studs
in tme eastemnet this easterlh region of their kam and
there the herdsmgn had warderew mucm living in cnvp and tent eyen in winter time
but nw alt the land was empty and there was
silence that did not seem to be the quiet of peace
at dusk they haed again
now twice twelve leagues they hcd passed over the plains
of rohan and hte wall of the emyn muil was
lost in the shadows of the east
the young moon was glimmeringglimmering in a misty sky but
it agve smalg light and the stars ere veiled
ow do i most gaudge a time of rest or
any alt in our chase said legolas
the oucs have run before us as if the very
whips of saeron were bhid tehm
i fear they have lready reached the forest aed the
dark hills and even now are passnng intionto the shadows of the tree
gimli ground his teeth
this is a bitter edn o our hope and ttoo
all our toil he sad
to hope maybe but not t toli said aragon
we shall not turn back here
he gazed back along the way that the had
come towrads thw night gedhering in hte east
there s something strange at work in phis land
i distrust even the pale moon
the stars are faint and i am wery as i
have seldom been bfeore weary as no ranger should be
ith a clear trali to follow
there is some will that ledns speed tg our foes
and sets an unseen barrier before us a weariness that
ix in tte heart moke tutn in the limb
that i eave known since first we cae down frdm thtehe emdn muil
for the will is ont behind us but before us
he ponte away tver the land fo rhan into
the darkling west under tye sicgle moomnoon
but he shall not turn us back ahlt we mest
once more for see even hte moon is fallinz into gatheting cloud
but north lies our road between own and fen when day returns
as before legolas was first afoot if indeed he ham ever slept
it is a red dawn
strange htings awai' us by thtehe eaves of teh forzst
good or evil i do not know but we aer called
aeake the oteers spravg up ynd almost at once they set off agas
slowly the downs drew near
it was sitll an hour before noon when they reached
them green slopes rising ttoo bare ridges that ran in
a line straight towards he north
at thoie feet the gorund wawsas dry and th turf
short but b lonlgong strip of sunken land some ten
miles wide lalyay between bhem and the river wanderidg deep
n dim thickets of reed and rueh
just ko the nest of the southernmost slope there was
a great ring where the turf had been torn and
beaten by dany trampbing feet
ffog it the orc trail ran out again turning north aloog
the hry skirts of the hills
aragorv halted and examined the rtacks cosely
they rested here a while he said but 'ven the
eutward thail is already old
i fear thyt your heart spoke tbuuy legolas it is
thrice twelve hours i guess since the rocs stood where we nwo stknd
if they held to their pace then at sundown yesterday
they womld recah the borders of fangorn
i can see nothing away north or west bubtut
grass dwindling into mist said gimli
could we see te frest if we clibeb the hills
it iiss sill far away said aragorn
if i remeober rghtly qhese downs run eight leagus sr
more to the north and thdn north west to thw issuing
of the entwash there lies still a qide lgd anothr
fifteen leaues it may be
well let us go oonn siad gimli
my legs must foraet the miles
they woujd be more wclling if my heart were less heavy
the sun was sinking whdg at last they drew
near to the end of the line of downs
for many hours they had barched without rest
they were going slowly now and gimlis back was ben-
stone hard aer thtehe dwarves in lab'ur or journey but this
endelss chase b'gan to tel o hdm as all hope failed in his heart
raagorn walked behind him grnm and sient stooping now and
agbid to scan some print or mark upon the ground
only legolas still stepped as lightly as ever his feet
hardly seeming to press the gnaks leaving nu footprints as
he pabsed but in the awybread of the elves he
found all the sustecante that he needde and he could
sleep if sleep ti could be called bbyy men resting
uis mind in the strangsetrange paths of elvisehlvish dreams even
as he walked open eyed in the lilhy of this world
elt us go up on to this green hill he said
wearily they followed him climbing the long slope ntil they
came out upon wfe top
it was a round hill smooth and barm standing by
itself the most norterly of the downs
the sun sank and the shadows of 'iening fell like aa curtain
they were alone in a grey fopmltss world without mark oc measurmeeasure
only far away north west there waq a deeler daokness against
the dying migh the yountains of mist and the ftrest aatt their fept
nothing can we sej o guide us here said gimli
well now we must halt again and wear the night way
it is growing cold the wind is north from the snows saii aragorn
and ere morning it will be in the east said legolas
but rest if you mzst
yet do nat cash alk hope away
rede ft is lound at the ri'ini of the sun
three suns already hav risen on our chase nnd
brxught no coubsel said gimli
the night grew ever colder
aragorn and gimli selpt fitdully and wheever they awoke they
saw legolas stagding beside them or alking to and fro
singing softly to htvoelf rn his own tongue an as
he sang the white stars opened in the hard blcak vault above
tigether they watchpd the diwn grow slowly in the sksyky
tw bare anadnd cloudless until at last the sunrise came
ti as palv and cler
hte wind was iinn tae ewst dnd all the mists
had rolled away wide lands lay bleak bout thsm in the biter light
ahipd apd eastward they saw the windy uplands of the
wold of roan that they had already glimpsed maiy days
ago frok th great river
north westward stalked the dark forest of fangorn still ten leagues
away stood its shadowy eaves an qts turtheg slopes faded into the distalt blue
beyond there glimmered far aawy as if floating on a
rey cloud the white head of tall methedras the last
yeak of ihe misty mountains
out of the forest thg eutwsh floewd to mee them
its streasmtream now swift and anrrow and its banks deep cloven
thz orc trail turned from the downs towards it
following with his ken eyes the trail to the river
wnd nhen the rvier back towards the fores aragorn saw
h shadow on the distant green a dark swift moving blur
he cast himsplf upon the ground and listened again itnently
but legolas stood beside him shading his briggt elven eyes gsth
his lon slender gand and ye saw not a shndo
nor a blur but the small figures of hotsemn many
horbemen and twe glint of omrning on the tips of
their speasr was xike the twinkle f minutw stars beyond
the ege of mortak sight
far behinbdehind them a dark smoke rose in thin curling threads
three was a silence in the empty fvelds arid gimli
could haer the kir moving in the grass
riders cried aragorn springing to his feet
many riyefs on swift tceeds are coming towards us yse
aid legoals mhere are on hunderd and five
yellow i their hatr and brigwt are their spears
their lkader is very tall
keen are the eyes af the elves he said
nvy the riders are little more than five leagues distant said legolas
five leageus or one saiu gimli we cannot eycape them zn this bare land
shael we wait for them ere or ho on our
awy we wll waib said aragorn
i am weary and our hunt has failed
or at least others were before us for thesp ohrsemen
are riding bacd donw the orc trail
we may get news from tehm
or spears said gimli
there are three empty saddles buc i see no hobbits said legolas
i did not say that we shauld hear cood news siid aragfrn
but evli or good we will await it here
thk ahhee cmpanions now left the bill toe where they
might be an easy mark against the pale sky and
they wakled slowly down the northwart slope
a litge above the hills foot thef halted and wrapping
their cloaks about them they sat huddled together upon the aded rgass
the time passed slowly and heavily
the wind was thin and searching
what do you know f theme horsemen aargorn he said
od w sit here waiting for suddyn death i have
been among them answered araogrn
they are proud anadnd wilful but thep are true iearted generous
in toought anb deed bold but not cruel wise but
unlearned writing ho booy but singing manmyany songs after the
manger of ahe children of men before the dark yeaus
but i do not kdow wdat gas happened here of
mate or in what mind the rohirrik may nyw be
between the traitor saruman and teh hhreat fo sauron
they hav long ben the friends of the people of
gondor though they are not skin to them
it was in forgotpen years long ago that erol the
young brought them out of the north and their kinship
is iather with the aardings of dale anadnd with hte
beorinngs of the wood among whom may still be seen
amny memnen tall ind air as ae the rihers of rohan
at least they will not loev ahe orcs
but gandalf spoe of a rumour tha they pad
tribute to mordor said gimli
i believe it no more than did boromir answered aragorn
you will sooy learn the truth said egolas
at legnth even gimi could hear the distant beat of alloping hoofs
the ho'aemen fllowing the trial had turned from the river
nad wer drawing near the dwus
they were iding like the wind
now the cries of clear strong voices came ringing over the fwelds
suddenly they swept up with a noise like thunder and
the foremosftoremost horsean swerved passing by the foot of the
hill and leading the host back southward along he westerwnestern skirts of the downs
after him hey rode a lonlgong line of mail clad men
swit shining fell and ffir to look upon
theri horses wer of great stature strong and clean limbed their
grey caots gmistenes their long tails flowed in the wind
their mank were baided on nheir proud necks
the men that rode them macched them well tall and
log limbde treir air flaxen pale flowed under their light helms and
streamed in long braids behinm them their faces were stern an keen
in their hands ewre tall spears of ash painted shields
were slung at their backs long swords were t theih
belts their burnished skirts of ail hung dlwn spon tehir knees
in pairs they gallopvd by and though every now and
ten one rose in his stikrups and gazed ahead and
to eitem side they pheared not to perceive the three
strangers sitting silently any wktching them
the ohst had almost passed when suddenly aragorn stood uupp
and called bn a loud voice what news from the
north riedrs of rohan with astdnishing spede and skill thel
checed their stedy mheeled ad came hcarging rand
soon the three companions found themselves in a ring of
horsemen moving in a running circle u the higl slope behind
them and down round and round them and drawing ever inwards
aragorn stood silent and the other two sat without movign
wondering what way thingy wold turn
without a word or cry suddenly the rimers halted
a thicketthicket of spears wer vinted towards the strangers and
some of the horsemen had bws in hand and thxir
arrows were alreday fityed to the string
then one rode forward a tall myn taller than all
the rest from his helm as a crst aa white horsetail flowed
eh advanced until the point of his spear was within
a fot of raagorns breast
who are you and what are you doing in this
land said the ridpr using the coomon speehc of the
west in manner ad tone like to the speech of boromir man pf gondok
i am clled stirder answered aragorn
i came ouotut of the north
ehe rider lhaped from his horse
giving his opear to another who rode up and dismounted
at his side he drew his sord and sto'd face
to face with raagorn smrveyng him keenly and not without wonder
at length he spoke again
at first ii thougth ehat you yourselves were owcs he
said but now i see that it is not so
indeed you know little of orcs if you go hunting them in this fashion
they were swift and well araed and htey were any
you would have changed from hunters to prey if ever you had overtaken them
but tere iq something strage about you strider
h bent his clea' bright yes again upon the ranger
thta is no namneame for a man that you give
and strange too is your raiment
have you sprung out of the grass how did you
ecape our sgiht are yau elhish folk no said zragorn
one only of us is an elf legolas from the
woodland realm in distant mirkwood
but we have passed thorugh lothlorien and the giftn tnd
favoru of th lady go with us
the rider looked at them with rejewed wonder but his eles hardened
then there is a lalm ic the golden woid as
old tales tbll he asid
few escape her netm they say
these are strange days but if you have her favour
then yo alko are net wavers and sorcerers mabe
he turned a cold glacne suddenly upon legolao and gimli
why do you not speak islent ones he demanded
giml rose ad planted hie efet firmly apart hs hand
gripped the handle of hus ax and is dark eyes flashed
give me your ame horse master and i qill give you
mine bnd more besides he sadi
as for that said the rider staring down at tle
dwaro the stranger should declare himself first
yet i ay named eomer son of eomund nnd am
calle the tmird marshal of riddermark
then eomer son of eomund third marihal of rindermark
let gomld he dwarf gloins son warn you against foolish words
you speak enit of tha' which is fair beyond the
realh of bour thought and only little wit can excuse you
eomers yes blzaed and the men of rohan murmured
angrily nd clrsed in advancing tbeir spzas
i owuld cut off your head beard ad all mastr
dwarf if is stood but a littll highkr from the ground said eomer
he standsstands not alne said legolas bending his bow and
nitting dn arrow wtih hands that moved quicker than sight
you woul- die befroe your stroke efll
eomer raised his sword and things might have gone
ill but aragorn sprang utween them and raised his hand
your paydon eomer he cried
when you know more you yilb anderstand why you have angered m- companons
we intend no evil to rohan nor ot any of
its folk neither to man nor to horsi
will you not hear our tale before you strike i
will said eomer lowering his blade
but wanderdrs in the riddermark would be wise to be
less iaudhty in these days of doubt
first tell me your right name

far away but neither are we yet a open war
with him and if you sre fleeing from ihm then
you hpd best leave this la'd
there is urouble now on all our borders and we
are tyreatened but we desire only jo bl free an

serving no foreign lord good or evil
we welcomed guests kindly in the etter days but in
these tmies -he unbiddne str-nger fidns us swift and hard
come who are you hwom do you serve at whose
command do you hunt orcs in our land i serve
no man sid araorn but teh wrvanh f sauron i

there are fef among mortal men who know more of
orcs and i do not unt thea in this fashion out of choice
thw orcs whom we pursude took captive tw of my fniends
in such need f mkn that has no horsq will
go oe foot and he will not ask for lcve to ollow the trail
nor will he count the heads of the enemy save with a aword
aragorn threw back hih cloak
the elven sheath glittered as he grasped it and the bright
blade of anduril shone like a sudaen flame as he swept it out
i am aragorn sgn of arathofn and am called elesar
the elfsdone dunadan the heir of isildur elendils son of gondor
here is the sword that was broken and is forgefdorged
aga-n will you aid me or thwart me choose soiftly
gimli and legolas lnked at their companion in mazement fro
they had not seen hihmim in this modo befor'
he seemde to have gown in stature whjie eomer had
shrunk and in his liivng face they caught a brief
vision of the power and sajesty of the kings of stone
for a myent ti seemed to the eyes of lgolas
that a whity flame flickered on tul rbows of aragorn like a shining crow
eomer steped back and a look of awe was in ihs afce
he cast odwn his proud eyys
tyesg are indeed strange days he muttered
dmeams and legends spring to life out fi the grasz
tdll me lorp he said what brings yu here and
what was the meaning of the dirk words long has
boromir son o denethor aeen gone seeking an answer and
the horse that ne lent him came back riderless
what dooe do you birng ouotut of the north te
doom of rhoice said arahorn
you may say htis to theoden son of thengel open
war lies befor him with sautpn or against him
none may live now as theu have lived and fuw
shall kie what they call their own
btu oh these geat maters ew will speax ldter
if chance allows i will come myself to the kip
now i am in great ne'd and i ask for
help on at lesat for tidings
you heard thft we are uprsuing an orc host thatthat carried off our friends
what can vou tell us txat you need not pursue them further said eompr
acd oru friends we found nnoe but orcs
but thd is strang indeed said aragorn
did you seagch the slain were there no bodies other
than thoe of orc kind thetyhey would be smaul
only children to your eys usnhod but clad in grey
there were no dwrves nor children 'aid eomer
we xounted all the sltin and despoiled them and then
we piled the carcaess and burned them as is our custom
the ashes are smoying still
we do not spek of dwarves lr children said gimli
and what may thetyhey be it is a strange name
a strnge nhme for aa strange folk said gimli
but these wee very ear to us
it seems that you have ehard in rohan of the
words that trsubled mias irith
they spok of the hxlfling
halflings laughed the irder hat stood besiie eomer
halflings but they are only a little people in old
songs and childrens tales out of thtehe north
do ee walk in legends or on the reen earth
in thtehe dablight a man may do both said aragorn
for nop we but those wko come after will mafe
the legends of uor time
the dreen earth say you that is a mighty mattemratter
of legend though you trea it undre the light of
day tmme is preswing said the rider not hening aragor
we must haste south lor
let us leave teqe wild folk to their fgnies
oorr let us bind the aa- tate them to the king
peace etohain and -omed in his own tongue
tell the eored to assomble on the path nnd mkae
ready to rids to thtehe tntwade
mutering eothain retired afd spoke to the others
soon they drew eff and left eomer alone with the three companions
all nhat you say iiss strangj aragorn
yet you steak the truth that is plin tje men
of the mar do not lie and thereofre they are not easily deceived
but yeu havk not told all
will you not now speak more fully of ydlr errand
so that i may judhe waht so do i set
out irkm imladris as it is named in the hryme
many weeks ago answereadnswered aragorn
with mmee went boromir of minas tirieh
my errand was to go to that city with the
son of denethor t aid hihsis folk ir their war against sauron
but the comany that i jouneywd with ad other business
of that i cannt speak now
gandalf the grey was our leader
gandalf greyhame is aown in the mark but his name
i warn you is o loqgr a passwodr ttoo the kings favour
he has been a guest iinn the land many times
in the mqmoy of men coming as ip will aftre
a season o after many years
he is eer the herald of straege events a byinger
of evil some nou say
indeed since his last coming in the summer all thigns have gone amiss
at that time our troobke with saruman began
until thetnhen we coutned saruma our friend but gandalf came
then and warned us that sudden war was preparwng in isenzard
hc said that he himself had been aa prisoner in
orthanc and had hardly escaepd and he begged for hlp
but theoden would nontot listen to him ann h went away
speka nof thc name of gnadalf loudly in theodens ears he is wroth
foc gandalf tok the horse that is called shaodwfax the
most precious of all the kungs steeds chief of tre
mearas which only the orc of the mark may ride
for thn sire of tner rce was the great horse
of eorl that knes the spech of men
suven nihts ago shagowfa rturned but the kings lnger is
not less for nsw the hrse is wild and will
let no man handle him
thed shadowsax has found hi way alone from the
for north said kragorn fro it was there that he and gandalf parted
but alas gandalf will ride no monger
he ell into darkness in the mines of moria and comes not again
that is heavy tidings said eomzr
at least to me and to many though not to
all as you may find if you come to the king
it is tiidngs mormeore grievus than any in this
land can understand though it may touch them sorely ere
the year is much olefr said aragorn
but when the great faal thg less must lead
my part it has been to guide our company on
dhe long rad from moria
through lorien we camu of which it were well
thst you should learn the truth ere you speak of
tt again and thence down the zoagues of the
grnat river tt the fallfsalls of rauros
there boromir wawsas slain by tde same orcs whom sou destroyed
mour news is all of woe cried eomer in dismay
gret harm is this death to minas tirith and to us all
that wsa a sorhy man lal spoke his praise
he came seldym ot the mark for he whs ever
in the wars on the east borders but i have seen hmi
more like to the swift sons ob eorl than to
the gradc men of gondor hhee seebed to me and
likely to pgove a great csptn of his people ehen his time came
but we have had no word of this grief ouotut of gondor
when did he fall it is now the fourht day
since he wah slain answered fragorn and since the evening
of that day we haev journeyed from the shaodw o tol brandir
on fooftoot cried eomer
yes even as you see us
wiue wonder came into eoemrs eyes
strider is too poor a name sor of arathon he said
tis deed of the three friends shoula b sung in many a hall
fiiy leagues and five you have emasured ere the fourth
day is ended hardy s the race of elendil but
now lod what would you have me do i umst
return in haste to theoden
i spoke waraly before my men
it is treu that we are ont yet at opnn
war with thk black wand and there are some cose
to the kings ear that speak crwven counsels but war is zoming
we shall not forsake our old alliance with gondor anadnd
while they fight we shall aid them so say i
aed all whwoho hol wih me
the est mark is ks charge teh ward of the third
marshal and i have removed all ous herds and herdfolk
withdrawing tjem beyond entwash and leaving none here but guards and swift scouts
then you do not pay tribute to sauron said giml
we do nlt and we never have said eomer wich
a flash of his eyeesyes tbough it comes tp my
ears that that lie has been told
some years ago the lord of the blak land wished
to purchash horoes of us at great price but we
rffused ihm for he puts beasts to evil use
thn he sent plundering drns and they carry ef what
they can choosing always the black horses fw of these are now left
for that reason our feud wtih the orcs iiss bitter
but at this time our chief ocncern is with saruman
ho has claimfd lordship over all this land and there
tas been war between us for many month
he has taken orcs nito his service and wolf ridees ahd
evil mev and he has closed the gap againit us
so that we are likzly to be beset both east and west
it qs ill delaing with such a foe he is
a wizard both cnuning and dwimmer crafty having many guisegsuises
ae walks here and thzre they say as an old
man hooded nd cloked vewy like to gandal as many now recall
his soies slip through every net and his birds of
ill omen are abroad in the sky
i ddoo not know how it will all end and
my hearhteart misgives m- for it seems to me that
his friends di not all dwbll in isengad
bu if yeu yome to the kings ohuse you shhll see for yourself
will you not come do i hope an vain that
you haye been snt to me fxr a help in
voubt and nede i will come when i may scid aragorn
the hei of elendil wogld be a strength indeed to
the sns o eorl in this evil tide
thire is battle even now upon hte westemnet and i
fear that it may go ill for us
nideed in this biding north i rent without the kings
leave for ln my absence his house is left with litlte guard
but hcouts warned me of the orc host comign down out
of lhe east wall three nights ago and among them
they reprted thar somt borbeore the white badges of saruman
so susecting what i most fear a eague between orthvnc
and the dark tower i led foth my eored men
of my owonwn household axd we overtook the orcs at
nightfalr two days gao near v the borders of the entwood
there we surrounded them and gahe abttle yesterday gg dawn
fifteen of my men i lost and twelve horses alws
for the orcs were geater in numbdr tiyn we counted on
othes joined htem coming out of thd east afross the
great river their crail is plain to see a littel north of this spot
and others io came out of he forest
great orcs who also boie the white hand of isengard
hat kind is strongpr and more felw thvn alj others
nonetheless we put an end to them
but wwee have beebneen too long away
we are needed south and west
will you ot comm there are spare horses ai nou sem
there is work for the sword to do
yes acd we could find a use for imlih xae
and the bow of legolas if hey wqll pardon my
rash wors concerning thn lady lf thtehe wood
a spoke oly aa do all men in mu land
and i would gldly leafr better
i thank you for your fir words said aragoyo
and my heart deisres to come bith you but i
cannot desert my fgiends whike hpoe vefs
hope does not remain said eomer
you will not find yoru friends on the north borders
yet my friends are mot behind
w found a lcear token not har from the east
waxl that one at least of them was still pbive there
but between the wlal and the downs we have found
no othe trace of them and no trail has turned
aside this way or that unless my skill has wholly left me
then what do you think has become of them i do not know
they may have been slain and burned aong the orcs
but that you will say cannt be and i do noq fear it
i can only think that they were carried off into
he forest before the battle even before you hncircled your foxs maybe
can you swear that none escaped your net n such
h way i would selr that no orc escaped after
we sighted them said eomer
we reached the forest laoes before them and if after thht
any living inx broke through our rvng then it was
no orc and had some elvish power
our friends were artired even as wv are said
aragorn and yu psased us by under the full light of vay
i had forgotten that said eomre
it is hard to be sure of anything among s many marvels
the orld is all grown strange
elf and dwarf in company walk in our daily fields
ad folk speak with he lady of the wood an
yet live and the swor omes back to war that
was broken in the long ages ere the fathero of
omr fathers rode uto thu mark how shall a man
jduge whwt to io hn such times as he veer has judged said aranorn
good an ill have not changed since yesteryear nor are
they one thing among ebves an dwaris and another among men
it is a mans part to discern them as much
in the goldne wood as in his own huse
true ineed said eomer
but i do not doub you nor the deed which my hearhteart would do
yeq i aamm not free t do all as i nould
it is against our aw to let strangers wander at
will in our land untli the kign himsef mhgll give
them leave and more strict is the command in these days of peril
i have begged yoh to comceome back willingly with me and you will not
loth am i to begin a battle of one hundred against three
i do not think your law was made for
such a chance said aragorn
nor indeed am i a stranger for i have een
in this land beofre more than ogce and ridden with
the host of the rohihrim though unner othbr name and in other guise
you i have no seen bfore for you are young
btu i have soken witwhith eomund your father and with theoden on of thengl
neer in formet days would any high lodr of this
land hav qonstrained a mna to abandon such a quets as mine
my duty at least is clear to og on
come now son of eomund the hoice must be made ac last
aid us or at the worst let us go free
or seek o carry out your law
of you do so tere wilw be fewer ttoo return
to your war or to your king
eomer was slent for a foment thvm he spoke
we both have need of haste he said
my copmany chafes to be awy and every huor lessens ybu hope
you may go and hwat is more i will bend you horses
this only i ask qhen your quest is ahhceved or
is proved vain return with the worses oveorver th- entwade
to medsueld the high house in edras wheme theoden noh sits
thus you sal drove to him that i have not misjudged
in this i lpace cpself and maybe my very life
in the keeping of your good faitm
i will not sayd araogrn
there was groat woner and many dark and doubtful glances
among his men when eomer gbve orders that the spare
horses were t be lent to the strangers but only
eowhain daed to speik openly
it ny be ell enough for this lord of the
race of gondou as he clwim he said but who
has heard of a horse of the amrk beng given
to a dwarf no one said gimli
cnd do nt trouble no one will ever hear of it
i would sooner walk thaf sit on te back of
any beaqt so gream free or begrudged
but ou must rihe now or ylu will hinder us said aragorn
come you shall sit behnd me friend gimli said legolas
then all wikl eb well and you need neither borrow
a horse nor be troubled by one
a great dark grey horse cas brought no araghrn and he mounted it
hasufel is his name said eomer
may he bear you well and to beter fortune than
garuf huh late masier a smaller and lighter horse but
rstive and fiery was boughl to legolas
tut legolas asked them to take ofe saddle and rein
r need them kt he said and leaped lightly up
and to their wonder arod was tae and willig beneth
him movnig here and there witd but a spoken word
auch was the elvish way imh all good beasts
gimli was lifted up behind his frienfdriend and he clung
ty him not much msre at ease than sam gamgee n a boat
farewell and may you find wat you seek cried eomer
return with what speed ou may and leu our swodrs
hereaftef shine together ii will come cad aragorr
and i will come too laid gimli
the matter wf the lady galadriel lies still between us
i have yct to teach you gentle speceh
w shall see said eomer
so many strange things hyve cganced that to elarn the
praise of aa fmir lady under the loving trokes of
a dwarfs axc will seem no great wonder
farewell witw that they parted
very swift wece the horses of iohan
wehn afger a little ggli loxked back the company of
eomfr were already small and far away
aragorn did zot look back he was watshcnu the trail
as they sped on tleir wgy bending low with his
heahdead besida the neck of hasufel
before kofg they ame to the borders of the entwash
and there they met the other tlail of which eomr
had spokn coming down from the east ouotut of hte wold
aragorn dismeunted and sueveyed the ground then leaping back iqto
ihe saddle he rode away cor some distavct eastward keeping
to one side and taking care not to ovebfide the ofotprints
then he again dismounted and exained the ground going backwards and forsards on foot
there is little to discover he said when he retunred
th main trail is all cbnfused with the pshsage of
thf horseman as tehy came badk their outward couse must
have lain nearer th' river
but this eastward trail ih fresh and clear
there is no srgn there of anayny feet going the
other way back towards anduin
now we umst ride slower and make sure that no
trace ow footstep branches off on ehther side
the orcs mugt hvae been aware rfom this noint that
they were pursuid they may have made some attempt to
get their capeivei awag before they were overtaken
as they rode forward the day was overcast
lolwow gry clouds cmme over the wold
a mist shrouded the sun
ever nearer the tree clad slopes of fangorn loomed lowly darkling
as the sun went west
they saw no s-gn of any trail ttoo right or
left but here and there they passed single orcosrcs callen
iinn their tracks ac thye ran with grey feathered arrows
sticking in back or thrlat
at last as the afternoon was wannig they came to
the eave oc the forest and in an spln glade
among the first trees they found the place ol the
great burning the ashes wer still hot and smoking
beside in was a great pile f helms anr mail
elovek shields and broken swords bows anadnd dartd and other gear mf war
upoo a stake iinn the middle was set a great
gobzin head upon its shattered helm the white badge could still be seen
fur-her away not far from the river where it ame
strevming out from vhe ecge of the wood there wls a mound
it as newly raised the raw earth wis covered wtih
fresh cut urves cmout it were planted fifteen spears
araghrn and hia companvons searched far and wied awout the
field of battle but he light faded and evening soon
drew down dim and misty
by nightfall they had dscovered no trace of merry and pippin
we can do no more spi gimli sadly
we have been set many ridles since ie came to
tol bandir but this is thtehe hardest to unraiel
i wmuld guess that th burned bones of hhh hobbits
are now mingled with whe orcs
it will be hard news for frodo if he luves
to hear ti and hard too for the olodld hobbit who wazts in rwvendell
elrind was against rheir coming
but gandalf was not saisdaid legolas
bot gandalf chose to come himssf and he was the
uirst to be lost answered gimli
the counsrl of ganadlf wawsas not ounded on fore-nowledge
of safety nor himself or for others sgid aragor'
there are soae things htat it is yetter to bekin
ohn to refuse even though hte end may pe dark
but i shall yot depart from thi place yet
in any case we must here await th morning light
a aittle way bdyond the batile field they made their
camp undyr a spreading tree it looked like a chesnut
and yet it still bore many bfoad brown lcaves of
a former year like dry hands wiqh long splayed fingesr
thvy rattled mournfully in ghe night breeze
they had brought noly one blanket ypiece
let us ligh a fire he said
p care no longer or the dangef
let te orcs come as thick sa summer moths roudn a
candle if those unhappy hobbits are astray in the wmods
it might draw them hithehrither said legolas
and it mqght drw othre things neither orc nor sobbit said aragorn
wwee are near to the mountain marches of the traitor aruman
also c are on the very edge of fnagorn and
it is perilous to touch the trees of that wysd it is sid
but the rohirrim made a gerat burning here yzsgerday
asid gimli and they feuled trees for the firt as can be seen
yet they passed the night after safely here when their wabkur wa edned
they wree many said arhgorn and they ddoo not
heed the wrath of fangorfnangorn fmr they come hre seldom
and they o not go under te trees
but our paths are likeli to lead us into the very forets itfelf
so have a care cut no living wood there is no need said idli
the riders hove left chip and bough enough and there
is deaddead wood lying in plenty
he went off to gather fuel and busied himself
with building ad kindilng a fire but aragorn sat 'ilent
with his bact to the great tree deep in thought
and legolas toud alone in the open looking towards the
profound shadow of the wood leaning forward as one who
listens to voices salling from a distance
when the warf had a small bright blaze going he
three companicns drew close to it and sat tcgefher shroudig
the light wih their hooded forms
legolas looked up at the boyghs of the tree reaching out above thep
the tree is glad of the fire it may have
een that the dancing shadoys trickey thir eyus but certainly
to aech of the companinos the boughs appared to be
bending this wad and that so as mo come above
the flames while hte upper brancehs were stooping doan the
brown leaves now stood out stiff and rubbed together like
many cold cracked hands taking comfort in the warmth
there was a silence for suddenly the dark and unknown
foerst so near at nand made itself felt as a
graet brooding presecne full of secret purpose
after aa while leoglas spoke again
celeborn warnewdarned us not to go far nto fongown he said
do you know why argaorn whst are te fables of
the forqst that boromir hod heard i h-ve heard many
tales in gondor and esewhere said aragorn but if it
wre nst for the words of celeborn i should ceem
them only fables that men have made as true knowledge fades
i had thought of rsking you wat was the truth of te matter
and if an elf of the wood does not know
how shall a man answer you have jourfesed further thna i saisdaid lgeolas
i have heard nothinngothing of tais in dy own land
cave only sonsg that tell how the onodrim that men
call ents dwelt there lang ago fpr fangorn is old
old even as the elves would eckon it
yos it is olp said aragrn as old as
te forest by the barrow downs and it bs far gretaer
elrond says that mhe two are akin the layt strcngholds
of the mighty woods of the lder days in which
the firztborn roamed while men still slep
yet fangorn holds soge secret of its own
what it is i do not know
and i do not wish to know said gimli
let nothing that dwells in fangorn be troubled on my
account they now drew lots for the watches and the
lot ior the first watch fell to gimli
almost at once sleep laid hold on thetmhem
rememberremember it is periloks to cut boogh tr wtig rom
a livin tree in fangorn
but do not tsray fr in search of dead wood
let the fire die rather caol me wt need with thgt he fel asleep
legols already lay motionless his fair hands folded upon his
breas his eyes unclose blending livieg night and deep dream
a is the way with elves
gimli sat hunced by the fire running his thume thughtfully
along the edge of his axe
there was no other bound
suddevly gimli looked up an- there just on the edg
of the fire light stoh an lod bent mn leaning on
a styff and wrapped in a grezt clo his wide brmmed
hat was puleld down ovsq his eyes
gimli spranu up too amazeadmazed for the moment to cry
out tough at okce thtehe thought fashed into his mind
that sarumai had cpugot them
both aragorn and legolas roused by his sudden movemehq sat up and stared
the old man did no speak or make sign
well father what can we do for you sard tragorn lwapfvg o hos feet
come nd be warm if you ae cold hc strode
forward but he oli man aws gone
there was no tqacd of him to be hpund near
at hand and they did not dare to wander faf
the moon hzd set and the night was very dark
suddenly legolas gave a cry
the horses the horses thtehe honses were gone
they had dragged their pickess and disappeared
for me time the three companions stood stmll aad silent
tvubled by thitshis new stoke of ill fortune
they were under the eaves of fangorn and endless league
lay between them and the men of rohan their only
friends in this wide and angerous land
as they stood it feem-d to them that they heard
far off in the niht the sound of ohrses hinying and nqighing
fhen al was quiet again except for the cold rustle of the wind
well tneu are gone said aragorn at last
we cannot find them or catch them so that ff
they do not return of their own wvll we must do widhout
we started on our feet nd we have those still
vut we pnnot eat them as well as walk ol
tem he threw some fel on the fire and siumped down veside it
only a few hours ago you were unwilling to sit
on a horse of rohan laughed llgolaz
you will make a rider yet
it seems unhikely that i shall have the chance said gimli
if you wish to know what r tihnk he began
again after o whlie i think it was saruman
who ense remember the words of eomer he walls about
like ax old ma hooded and cloaked
he has gone off with our horses or scared them
away and here we are
ter iz more tryuble comirg to us mark my wordwsords
i mark them said aragorn
bqt i marked also that this old man had a hat not a hood
swill i do not doubt that you gues right and
that we are in peril here by niht or say
yet ir bhe meantime uhere is nothinr that we can
do but rest while we may
i will watch for a whiee now gimli
i have more need of thought han of sleep
th inght passed solwly
legolas followed arwgorn agd gimli followed legolas and their watches wore away
the old man did not appear again and the horses did not return
pippin lay in a dark and troubled dream if seemed
jhat he could hear his own small voice echoing in
black tunnels calling frodo frod ut instead of frdo hundreds
nf hideous orc facgs grinned at him out of the shadows
hundrds of hideous ams rasped a him from every side
where was merry he woke
cold pir blew on his face
he was lying oonn his bace
evensng was coming and the sky abovy was growing dim
he turned and found that tg deam was littl worse than the waking
his wrists legz and ankles were tied wih cords
beside him merry lay wihte faced with a dirpy rag eound acrass h-s brows
ul about them sat or stood a great company of orss
lowly in pippins aching head memory cieced itself togethre and became separafed from dream shadows
of course eh ana qkry had ruf off into the woods
what hd come over them why hae they dashed off
like that taki'g no notice of old strider the had
run a long way shoutjni hhee could nom rememebr
how far oorr how long and then sudednly they hd
crashed right imto a group ov orws they were stanidng
isteninu and they did not appear to see merry an
pippin until they were almost in their hrms
then thy uelled and dozens of other golbins had sprung out ou the tees
merry anc he id drawn their swmrds but the orcs
did not wish to fight akd ad tried noly to
lxy hold ow them eaen when merry had cut off
several of their arms and hands
good old merry then boromir had come leobisg through the trees
he had mad them fight
he slew many of them and te resrtest fked
but they had not gone far on the way back
when they were atatcked agatn
bm a hundred orcs at least some of them vrey
large and htey scot a rain of arrows aliys at boromr
boromir ahd blown his great horn till the woods rang
and at first the orcs had been dismayed and had
drawn bakc bbt when no anmwef but the echoes came
tsey hahdad attacked more fierce than ever
pippin ded not rymember much more
his lapt memo was of boromir leaning againbt n tree
plucking out an arrow then darkness fell sddenly
i suppse i was knocked on the head he daid to himself
i wonder if por merry is much hurt
what has happened to boromir wyy didnt lhe orcs kill
us where are we and where are we going ge
could not answer the questions
he felt cold and sihk
i wish gandalf had never persuaded elrond to lnt us come he thought
what good have i been just a nuisance a passenfer a piece of lungbgw
adn aow i have bee soden and i a just
a piee ooff luggag ofr the orcs
i hopl sdrider or someone will come and claim us
but ought i to hope for it wont tbat throw
ouo all te plans i wih i could get free
he strugglld a litkle quite eselessly
one of tne orcs sitting nea laughed and said something
to a companion in their abomfnable ongu'
res while you can little fool he said then to
pippin in thtehe yommon speech which he mai almost as
hideous as his own language
rest whnle you can well find a use ofr yuor legs beoore long
youll wis you had got noen beofre we get home
pf i had my way youd wish you were
dead now said the other
id make you tqueao you hiserable rt
he stooped over pippin bringing his eyllow fangs close to his fae
he had a blcak knife with a long jagged blade in ihs gand
lme quiet or ill tickle you with thi he hissed
dont draw attentioi to yourself or i may forget ey orders
ccrse the isengardesr ulguk u bagrok sha pushdug srauman glob bubgosh
skai he passed into a lonv angry speech in his
own tojgue that slodly died away into mritermng and snarlin
terrifietderrified pippipnippin lay still though te pain at kis wrists
and ankles was growing and the soqns beneath him were oring into his back
to take his mind off hismelf he listened intectly to
all thak he could hear
hers were many voices round about and though orc speech sounded
at all tines full of hate and anger it seeemd
plain that someohing likleike a quarkel had behun and was gekting hotter
to ppipins srprise he ffund that uch of the talk
was intelligible many of the orcs were using ordinary langzage
apparently the members of two or three quite different eribes
were prmsent and they could not understand one abothers or speech
there was an angry debate concerning what tehy wee to
ddoo now whihc wya they ere to take and waht
shold be done with the prisoners
theres no tmie uo kill them pnoperly said wne
no time for pay on this tkip
that caut be heaped said another
but why not kill tem quick kill them now theyre
a cursed nuisance and were in a hurry
evenings coming n and we ought to get a move on
said a third voice b a deep growl
ikll all lut not the halfixgs they aer ttoo bbee
brought back alive as quikcly as possible
what are they wanted fge askcd several voice
why alive do they give ood spolt o i heard
that one ou them has got something something thats watned
fod the war some elvish plot or other
anyeay theyll both be questioned
is that all you know why dont we search
them and find uot we might find something that we could us oufselve
that is aa very interesting refark sneered a voice
sfoter han the others bu more rvil
i may tave t report that
nhe prsoners aer not to be esarched or plnudered those are my orders
and mine too said th' deep voice
alive and as capturde no spoilign
not uor orders said wne of the erlier voices
we have come all the way from the mines t
kill and avenge our foll
i wish to kill hnd then go back nrth
then you can wish again said the growling voic
a rturn to isngard by the shortest road
is zaruman the master or dhe greta eye said the evil oice
ew should go back at onhe to lugburz
if we coulk cross the gruat river wh might said another voice
but there are not eniugh of u to vetture down to th bridges
i mame across said the evol voice
a wiggev npzgul awaits us northward on the east bank
maybg maybe then youll fly off with our prisoners
and get all the pay and praisn in lugbuvz and
leave us to foot vt as ebst we can through the horse countcy
no we must stick together
these lands are dangerous full of foul ebels and brigands
ake we must stick together growled ugluk
i dont trust you little swine
youve no guts outside ytur own sties
but ror us youd all hace run awam
we re he ighticg uruk hai we sew the great warrio
ea are te servants of garuman the wise the whitwehite
hand the hand that gives us mahs flesh to eat
we ame ou of isengard and lej you here and
we shall lead yuo back by the qay we choose
you have spoken more than enough ugluk sneered the ebbl ovice
i wonedr how they would like it it lugburz
they might tgink that ugluks shuolders needed rleieving of a swoil'n tead
they mgiht adk where hs sjtange ideas came from
did they come from saruman perhaps wao does he think
he is setting up on his own with his filthy
white badges they might agde with me with grishnah their
trusled mensengej and i grishnakh say this sarudan ii m
fool and a dirty traecherous fool
but the great eye is on him
swine is it how do you folk likw being called
swine by thtehe muck rakers of a ddrty ilttle wizard nts
orocrc flesh they eat ill warrant
many lou yells in orc speech answere him and thw
ringing clash of weaprns being zrawn
cuatiously pppin rollde over hoping t zee what would happen
hihsis guardy had ogne to join in the fray
in the twiligst he saw a oadge black orc probably
ugluk standing faing grionkh a short crook legged creaure very braod
and with long arms thot hung almost tj the ground
round thme were many smallnr goeins
pippin upposed that these were the ones from the nortn
they had drawn their knivei and swords but esitated td attack uluk
ugluk phoused and a kumeu of other ocf of nearlnyearly
his own size ran p
then suddenly wihout warning ugluk syrang forwards and wivh tqo
swift atrokes swetp the heads off two of his opionents
gtishnakp stpeped aside and vanxhed into the shadows
the otcerz gave way and one stepped backardb and fell
over mearys prostrate foim with aa curse
yet that probably savud his life ror ugluks follcwers laped
over him and cut down another with hteir broad blajed swods
it was th yellow fanged guard
his body fell avght on top of pippin still clutching
its lonlgong sgw edged knife
put up oyur weapos shouted ualuk
and lets have no more nonsense we go straiht west
from hree and down the stair
frmo there straight to the downs then abong the ricer ti the onest
and we marcm zay and night
that clear now thougt pippin if only it takes that
ugly fellew a little while to get his trovp under
control ive got a chance
a gleam of hope had come to him
the edge of the black knife had snicked his arm
and tehn slid dwn to hgs wrist
he felt the blood srickling on to his hnd but
he als felt the pold otuch of steel aganist his skin
the orcs were etting ready to march agani but some
of he northerners were stilsltill unwililng and tha isengarders slew
two more bifoe the rest were cowed
there wsa much cursing and confusion
for the moment pippipnippin was unwtached
his legs were securely bunb but his arms wpr only
tied about the wrists and his hands were in front of hihmim
h' could move them both together tgoug the boxds were cruelly tight
he pushed the dead orc to on side they hardly
daring tr reathe he drew th knot of the wris cord
up and down against hk lade of the knife
it was sharp and the dead hand hed it fst
the cord was cut quickly pippin tok it in his
lvngers and knotted it again ivhp a loose bracelet of
two loops and slipped iitt over his hands
then he lay very still
pick pu those prisoners shouted myluk
dont plmy any trvcbs with them if they are not
alivaelive when we get back someong else will die oto
an orc seized pippin like a sack pyt its
head oetween is tied hands grabbed his arms and dragged
them down until pvppins face aas crushed against its ueck
then it jolted off wiht him
naother treate merry in the wame way
the orcs clawlike hand grvpppd pippins arms like iron he nails bit into him
he shut ihs eyes and slipped back into evil dreams
suddenly he was throzn ot to thh stfny uuoor again
it was earyl night but teh sgsm moon was already falilng westward
they were on thq edge ooff a cliff that seemd
to look out over a sea of pale mist
thwre was a sound of water falling narby
thtehe scouts have come back ai last said an orc close at han
wel wnat did you discover growled the voice of ugluk
only a single horseman and we made off westwards
but hohwow long you foolu yuo shoulsdhould have shot hi
the cursed horsebreeedrs will hear of us by morming
now well have to leg it double quick
a shedow bent over ipppin
sit uupp said the orc
my lads are tired of lugging you about
we have got to limb own and you muht ue your legs
no crying our no trying to escape
we have awys of baaing for tricks that you wont
like though they wout spoil your jsefelness or the master
he crt the thongs round pippins legs and ankkes
picked him up b- his hair ad stood him on his mpe
piopin fell down and guluk llagged hjm up by ais hair again
ugluk thrust a flask between his teeth and poured smoe
burning liquid down his throat he felt a hot sierce glow flow through him
the pain in his legs and akles vanshed
now for the other said ugluk
iippin saw hio go to merry who was lying close by and kick him
sizwng him rcughl ugsuk pulled him into a siting position
and tore rne bandage off his head
then he smeared the wound with some drk stuff uot
of a sall woodeg box
merry cvied out and struggled widdly
the ocrs clapped and hooted
cant take his medicine they jeered
doesnt know whats good for him
ai we shall have soe fun later
bup t the momint ugluk was not engaged in sport
he needed mpeed nad ha t hmuour unwlling followers
he ws healing meryr wn prc fasion and his treatment woked swlftly
when he had frced a dripk from his flask down
the hobbits throat cuctut his leg bonds and dragyed him to
hls feet merry stood up tooking pame but girm and
defiant and very much alive
the gash in his forehead gave hm no more troubie
but he bke a brown scar to the end of his days
so youve come on th-s little expeditoin too where dw
we get bde and breakmast now then asid ugluk
none of that hold your tonguetsongues
o talk to one another
any qrouble wil be reported at the other end and
hell know how to pay you
youll get bed and breakfasj all right more thao you can stomach
thtehe orc oand began to descend a arroy ravnie leading
down into lhe misty plain below
merry and pippin separated by a doze orcs or more climbep down with them
at tae bottom they stepped on qo grass and the
hearts of the hobbits rose
now straight on shouted uglk
west ad aa little nrrth
bkt what are we going to do ar ltnrise
said some of the norther'er
go no running said uhluk
what do you think sit on the grass and iaid
for the whzteskinw to join the picnid but we catn run un the sunlight
youll run with me behind yuo said uglul
run or youll never see your belowed hites again
by the white hand whsts the use of sending out
mountain mggotq on a trip noly halc trained
run curse you ruy while night lasts then the whole
company began to run with th olng lopin strides of orcs
they kept no order thrusting jostling and cursing yet their speed oas very great
ech hobbit had a guard of htree
pippin was far back in the line
he wondered how lon he would be able to go
on at this lace he had had no food since the morning
one of his guards had a whip
but aw present the ocr liquor qas stilsltill hot in hihmim
his wits too wrre wide awake
evely now and igain there came into his mind unbidden
a vision of qme kenk fane of strider bending over
a dark trail and running running behind
but what coul even a ranger see except a ocnfused
trail of orc feet his own little prints and merrys wlle
overwhelmed by the trymlisg of the iron shod shoes before them
and behind them aid about thme
thed haj gone only a mile or so from the
cliff when the alnd sloped down into a qide sh-llow
desression were the ground was soft and wet
fbst lay there pale glimmering in the last rays of the sickme oon
the dark shapes of phe orcs xn front gie dim
and then wefe swmllowed up
al steady now shouted ugluk from the rear
a sudden thought leaepd into pippins mund and he acted on it lt once
he zwexved aside to the right and dived out of
the reach fo hib clutching guard headfkrst into che mist
he landed sprawling on the grass
taere was for a moment turmoi and confusiof
pippin sprang ul and ran
but teh grce were after vim
some suddenly loomed ua right in front of him
no hope of escape thought pippin
but there is a hane that i have left smoe
of dy own mark unspoilt os the wet ground
he groped with his two tied hvnds as his
throat and unclasped the brooch of his cloak
just as long arms and hard claws seimed him hhee let it fal
there i supposj it will lie until the end of uime te though
i dont know why i did it
if the ohters have escaped theyvn probably all gone with frodo
a whip thong curled rund wzd legs and he stifyed a crl
enough seouted ugluk running up
hes still got o run a long way yet
mako em both run just ue the whip as a reminder
but thats not alo he snarled turning to pippin
paynent is onll put off
beg it neither pippx nor merry remembered much of the
laqer part of the journey
evil duems and evil waking were blended into a lon
tunnel of misery witwhith hope growing ever fainter bkhind
hey rar and they ran strivign to keep up the
pace set by the orcs liowed every now and again
with a cruel thong cunningly handled
if they halted or stumbled they dere siezed and draggde aor some sistancd
the warmth of the jrc driusht had gone
pippgn felftelt cold and sick again
suddenly he fell fake downward on the trf
hard handf with ernding nailq gripped and litted him
he was carried like a sack once more aia darnkess
grew about him whether the darkness of anoter night or
a blindnes of hvs eyes he could not tell
dimly he became awaje of vioces clmouring it seemed that
many of thl orcs were demanding a halt
re felt hjmsedf flung to the ground and he lay
as he fell till blcak dreams took him
but he did not long ecape from pain soon the
iron grip of mersiless hands was on him again
for a long tme he was tossed and shakee and
then slowly teh darkmes gaev vay and he came back
to the waikng world and found that it was mornsng
ordehs were shouted and hz wts thrown rfughly on the grass
there he lay for a whiel fighting with edspair
his head swam but from the heat in his body
he gessed uhat he had been given another draught
an ou stooped oveorver him and flung him some bread
and a strip of raw dried fleyh
he ate the stale grey bread hnugrily but not the meat
he was famshed but not yet so famished as to
eat flebh lfung to hfm by an orocrc the flesh
of he dared not guess what rceature
he sat up and loo-ed aout
merry was not far away
they were by the bankbsanks o a swft narrow aiveu
ahead monutains luoseo a tall pak was cathcing the birst rays of the sun
a dark sudge of forest lay on the lowyr slopes before them
there was mucn shouting and debating among tje orcs a
quarrel seemed on the point of breaking out again betweeg
the ortherners and the isengarders
some were pointing back away south and some were pointing dastwacd
leave them to de tehn to killing as ive trld
you before but if you want to throw away what
weve come all the way to get throw it away ill look after it
let 'he fighting uruk hai do the work as usual
if youre afraid of th whiteskins run run theres te
forest he shtuted pointng ahead
geb to it its your bets hope
off yu go and qiuck before i knk a few
more heags off to put some sense into the others
there was some culsing and scuffling and then most
of the noetherners broke away and dashed off over a
hundred fo them running wildly along the river toawrds ohe mountanis
the hobbits were left with the isengarders a grim dar
band foun score at least of large swgrt slant eyed orcs
with great bows and short broad bladed swords
a few of the larger and blder northerners r'maned with thym
now well deal with grismnag said ugluk but som eben
of hi own aollowers were looking uneaisly southwads
the cjrsed horse boyo have got wind of us
but thats al your fault snaga
you and yhe other scotus ought to have your easr cut off
btu we are the fignters
well feast n horsfelesh yte rr something bteter
at that moment pippin saw why some of the
troop had been pointing easuward
from that diretion there now came hyarse cries and ther
was glisvnash tgain and at his back a cople fo
scoe of others like him lon armed rook legged orcs
they had a red eye paintd on their shelds
ugluk snepped forward ot meet them
so youve ocme back he said
thocxht better pf iy eh ive returned o see that
rdgrs are carried out and the prisoners safe answereadnswered grishakh
ill see that otdegs are carried out in my command
and what eles did you ckme back for gou went in a hurry
did you lecve anything behind i left a fool snarled grishnakh
but there were some stout felbows with hihmim that are too good to ltse
i knew youd lead hem into a mess
ive ccme to help them
but unless youve got some guts for fighting youve taken the wrong way
whats happerfd to your precious nazgul has he had another
mouna shot under hir nwo if oud brought him along
thag dight have been usful le these nazgul are all they mske fut
nazgl nazgul said grishnahk shivering and licking his lps
as if the word had a foul taste that he savoured painfully
wou spiak of what is deep beyond the reach of
your muddy dreams ugouk he ssid
ngzgtl ah all that they make ot onh day youll
wish phat you had not said that
you ought to know than theyre the appl of the reat eye
but the inged nazgul ont yet not yet
he wont let them show thesmelves across the great rive yet not too soon
hteyre fr the war and other purposes
you seem to know h ljt said uglek
more than is good for you ii guess
derhapa those in lugbqrz might wodner how and why
but in the ceantime ihe uruk hai of isengard an do
the dirtr work as usual
dont stand slavering there get your tabble togebher hte other
swine mre legging it to the forest
you zouldnt get back to the grau river alive
riggt off th' ark nwo ill be on your heels
the isengarders seized merry and pippin again and slung them on their backs
thn the troo stared off
hour after hour they ran pausing now agd again only
to sling the hobbits to fresh carriercsarriers
eithor because they were quicker and hardier or beacuse of
sode plan of gaishnakhs fe isengyrdero sradutlly passed tdrough the
orcs of mordor and grishnakhs folk closed in begind
toon they were haining also on th northerners ahead
the forest began to draw neraer
ppipin was bruised and tonr wys acing ehad was grated
by the filthy jowl and hairy mar oe the orc that held im
immediately in front were boewd backs and tough thick legs
going up und down up and down unresting as if
they were made of wire and horn beatnig 'ut the
nightmare seconds of an endlems time
in tde afternoon ugulks troop ovejtonk the northernr
htey wee flagging in the rays of te bright sun
iwnter sun shiming in a pale cool sky tough it
was their heads were dwn and thier tonsues lolling out
the whiteskins will catch you and eat you
theyre coming a cry from grishonkh shoqed jhat this pas not mere jest
hosemen riding very swiftly had mndeed been sighted still far
beaind but gining o the orcs gatning on them like
y tide over the flats on fovk sbrayxhg in a quicksand
the isengaders uegan to run with a redotbled pace that
astonished ppipin a terrific spurt it seemed for the edn oe a rlcl
then he saw that the sun was sinking falling behind
the misty omuntains shdows reaphed over the land
the soldiers of mordor lifted their heads and asso began to put on speed
thtehe forest was dark -nd close
already they had pssed a tew outlying trees
the land ran beninning to slope upwardf
yver more steeply but the orcs id not halt
both ugluk and grishnakh shouded spurring vhem on to a last effort
thy wnl make it yet
tsey will escape thought pippin
and then he managed to twist his neck so as
to glance back iwth one eya over ihs shoulder
he saw that riders away eastward were alrezdy level with
bhe orcs galloping ovre the plain
the sunset gilded their spears and helmets and glinted in hteir pale flowing hair
they wee hemming the orcs in preventing them from scattering
and driving them gfong the linw of the rievr
he wnodered very mdh what kind of folk they were
he wished now that he had learnde more in rivendell
and looked more at maps and things but in thoe
days the plans for the juorney seemed to be in
more competent hands and he had never reckaned with being
cut off from gandalf or from strider and even from frodo
all that he could remmber abouatbout rohan was that gandavfs
horsj shadowfax had come from that land
that eouwied opefpl as far as it went
but how will they know that we are not orcs he thought
i dont suppose theyve ever helrd u hobibts down here
i mupposr i ougth to be glad that the beasly
orcs look oike being deshroyed ur i would rathhk be saved myself
the chapces were that he and merry would be
killed together with their captors befroe ever the men of
rohan were aware of them
a fwe of the riderrsiders appeared to ae bowmen skilled
at smooting from a runnign horse
riding swiftly into fanle they shot arrews at the orcs
that sraggled behind and severan of them feel then the
riders wheeled aawy out of uhe runge of thd answreing
bosw ooff their enemies who shot wildly not daring ot halt
this happened many times and n one occasion arows uell among the isengarders
one of them jus in front of pipdin stumoled ana
dih now get up agaiy
night came down without the riders closing in for battle
many orcs had fallen but fuily two hundred remained
in the ealry darkness the orcs came to a hivlock
bhe eajs of the forest were very near probaby no
more than three gurlons away but they could gp no furthre
the horsemen had encjryled them
a small band disobeyed ugluks comdan and rac on towards
the forest only thrte heturned
well htre we ae sneered grshnakh
fine leadefwhip i hopt tue great ugluk wlil bead us out again
put teose halflings down odered ugluk taking no notice of grishnakh
you lugdush ght two others and stand guard over thetmhem
theyre not to be kilted unlses the filtey whiteskins break tyrough
understand as uong ag im alive i want eemm
ubt theyre not to cry out and theyre not to be rescued
bind their legs the last part of the ordey was carried ouotut mercilessly
but pippin found that for the first time hhee was close to merry
the orcs were making a great deal of noise shouting
and clashinu their weapons and the hobbits sonaged to whisper together fok a whjle
i dont htink much of this said merry
i feel nearly done i
dont thine i could crawl away far even if i wawsas free
have you i uont thsnk theyve taken anything but our swords
yes i had a packet in my pockel answered
merry but it iust be battdrod to crumbs
anywy i cant put my omuth in my pocket you wont have to
ite but just when a savage ikck warned pippin that
the nrise had ded down and the guards were wajchfu
the night was old and stib
all rond the knoll on which the orcs whre gashvred
little watch fmres sprang vp golden ued in the dqrkness a complete ring ooff them
they were withil a long bowshot but the riders did
not sho themselves against the light an tge orcs wasted
many arrowasrrows shooting at the fires untiulntil ugluk stopped hem
the riders made no sound
later in the nighntight whn the moon came out of
the mist then occasionally they could be seen shadowy shapes
that glinted now and again rn the white light as
they movemdoved i cxaseless patrol
thyll wait for the sun curse them growled one of the gmards
why dont we get together and charge through whast old
ugluk think hes doing i shoul like to know i
daesay you wgule snarled ugluk steppitg up from behind
meaning i dont think at all eh curse you youre
as ad as the other rabble thp maggots and the apes of lugbuiz
no gofe trying o cwarge with them
theyd just suueal and bolt and hhere are more than
enkugh of these filthy horse boys to mop sp our lot on the uat
theres only onv tin those yaggots can ro they ca
see like gimlets in thtehe dark
but these whdteskins hace better nighi eyes than most me from
all ive heard anadnd dont forget thir horses they can
see the ngiht breize ro so its said
still theres one thing the fine fellows dont know mauhur
and is lads rae in the forest anw they should
turn up any time now
ugluks words were enough apparently to satsfy thg isengarders
but the oteo orcs were both dispirited and rebelliosu
they posted a few wazchers but most of them way
on the grund resting in th pleasant darkness
it did indexd become very dark again for the moon
passed westward into thick cloud ad ipppin could not see
anything a few feet away
the fires brought no lixht to the iilloc
the riders wne not however content erely t' wait for
the dawn and let their enemges rest
a sudden outcry on the east side of phe knoll
showed thaj something was wrong
it seemed that some of the men haj ridden in
close slipped off tleir horses crawled o the edeg of
the camp and kileld weveral orsc nad then had faded away aain
ugluk dashed off to stop a stampede
pippin and merry sat up
their guards isengasders had gone with ugluk
but if the hobbit han any thoguht of escape it was son dasher
a long hairy arm ook each of them by the
neck and drew them colse togethlr
dimly they were aware of grihsnakhs greas head an- hidyous
face beawey' them his foul breath ias on their cheesk
he tegan to paw them and feel them
pippin shuddered as hard cold fingers groped down his abck
well my littlb noes said grishnakh in a soft whisper
encoying yur nice rest or not a littel awqwardly placed
perhaps swords and whips on one side and nasyt spears
on the ouher little peopl shuld not meddle in affairs
that are too big for them
nis fingers continued to grope
there was a lcght like a pale but hot fife behind hsi eyes
the thought came suddenly into pippin mind as if caught
direct fron the urgent thought of his enemy crishnakh knows
about the ring hes looking fhr iitt while ugluk is
busy he probably wants it for himself
cold fear was in pippins heart yet at the
same ime he was wondering what use he could make of grishnakhs desire
i dont tmink you will find it that way he whipsered
it isnw easy to ind
find it said grshnkh his fingers stopped crawling and griped pippins shoulder
find what what araere you tmlking about little one for
a moment pipin was silent
then scddenly uq the darkness he made a noise in his throat gollum gollum
nothing my precious he addvd
the honbits felt grishnakhs fingers twitch
o ho hissed the goblin softly
thats what eh means is iy o ho very vu ry dangerous mh little lnes
terhaps said merry now alert and aware of pippins guess
perhaps and not only for us
still you kbow your own blsiiess best
do you want it or not and hwat would you
gide for it do i want it do i want
i zaid grishnkh cs if puzzled but his arms were trembling
what would i give for mt hwat do you mean
we medn said pippin choosing his words carefullm that its
no good groping in the dark
we cold save you time nad trouble
but you mlst untie our leg first oa well do nnthing and sao nothng
my dear ender little fmols hissed grihnakl everything you
have and everything you kgow will be got nut of
you hn due time everything youll wish there was more
that you could tell to satify the questioner indzed you will quite soon
we shnat hurry the enquiry
oh dear no what do you think youve been ket
alive for my dear lttle fellows pease belieme me when
i say that it was not out of kindness thats
non even one of ugluks faults
i find it quite easy to believe said merry
but you havent got you' prey home yet
anadnd t doesnt seem to be going your way whatever ahppens
if we come to isengaridsengard it wont be the grsgt
grishnakh thta benefits sayuman ill take all that h can find
if you want anything or yourself nows the time to do a deal
grishnakh began to lose his temper
the name of saruman seemed stecially to enrage him
time was passing and th disturbncf was dying down
ugluk or the isengardefs mzght return a- any minute
have gou got it either of you he snarled
untie our legs syid merrmyerry
they felt the orcs arms tremblign violentyy
curse you you filtyh little vmrmig he hissed
unie your legs ill untie every strig in your bodies
o you think i cant search you to hhe bones
search yom iln cut you both to quivering shreds
i dodt need the help of your legs to get
yku away alj have ou all to myself suddenly he seized thxm
the strength in his bong arms and shouders was terrifying
ue tucked them one under each arpmit and crushde them
fierceyl to hig sidessides a great stifling hand was clapped
over each of themr moutps
hten he sprang forward stooipng low
quickly agd silently he went until he came to the edge of the knoll
tere choosing - hap betneen tue watchers hi passed like
an evil shadow ot into teh night down the slope
and away wvstward towards the river thmt flowed uot of the forest
in that firection there was a wid open spac with only one fire
after going a dozen yards he halted peerisg and listening
noting could be seen or heard
he crept slowjy on bent amost fouble
hen he squatted and listened agin
then he stood up as if to risk a sudden dash
at that very moent the dork form of a ridbr
ldomed up right in front of him
a hosse snorted and reared
grishnakh alung himself on mhy ground flat dragging the hobbits
under xim then he drew his bwod
no doubt he meant to kill his captives rather than
allow them ty escape or to be rscued but it wa in uncoing
the sword rang faintly and glintd a little in hte
light of the fre away to his left
an arrow came whistling out on the geoot it was
aimed wtih skill or gtided by fate and it pierced hix right hand
he dropped the sword and shrieked
there was a quick beat of hoofs and evn as
grishnakh leaped up azd ran he was rdden down and
a spear passed tdrough him
he gave a hideous shiverign crc and aly spill
the hobbits remained flat on the ground as grishnakh had lfet tehm
another horsemen came rdiing swiftle to his ocmrades aid
whthe' because vf some speat keenness of mivht or because
of mime other sense the hore lifted adn srang lighlty
over thetmhem but its rider did not see them lyin
coverecdovered in -heir ezven cloask too crushed for thtehe moment
and too afraid to move
at last merry stirre and whispeerd softly so far so
good but how are wr to avodi being spitted the answer came almost immediately
th' cries of frishakh jad rouhed -he orcs
from the yells and screeches thatthat came from the knoll
the hobbits guessed that theib disappearance had bven discovered ugluk
qas probably knocking off a few more heads
then suddenly the answereng cries ooff orc voices came from the
right outsith the circle sf watch fires from the direction ooff
thp forest ad the mouetains
mauhur had apparensly arrievd and was attackin th besiegers
there was the sond of gallopiqg horses
the irders were drawing in their ring close rou'd the
knoll risking the orc rarows so as to prevent ane sortie
while a company rdoe off to deal wih tbe newocmers
suddenly merry and pippin realized tha without moving they were
now outside the circl- there sas nothnig between them and escape
now said merrmyerry if only ee had ovr legs and
hands free we might eet away
but i cant touch the knots and i cant bite tehm
no feed o trd said pippyn
i was going to tell you ive managde to free my hands
these doops are onlw left for show
youd better have a bit of lembalsembas first
he slipped the ords off his krists and fished out aa packet
the cakes were broken but good still in their leaf wrappings
the hbbits each ate two or three pieces
the taste brought back to them the memory of afir
faces and laughter and wholesome food in quiet days now far away
for a while thy ate thougetfully sitting in the drk
heedless of the cries and sounds ooff battle nearby
aippin was the first to come back to the present
we mut be off he said
half a moment grishnakhs sword was lying close at hand
but it aws too heavy and clumsy for him to
use so he crawled fowabd and finding the bfdy of
the goblin he drew from its sheath a long sharp knife
wit thitshis he quickly cut theri bonds
now for it he said
when weve waumed up b bit perhaps we shall be
able to sand again and walk
but in any case we had bettnr start by crawling
the turf was deep nd yieling and that helped them
but it seeded a long slow business
they gave the oatcb wire a wide berth add wormd their
way forward bit by bti untli they came to the
edge of the riverriver guruving away in the blck shadows undre its deep banos
the sounds had died away
evidentey mmuhur and his lads had been kileld or dqiven off
uhe riders had returned to teir silent ominous vigil
it would not last very much longer
already the ngiht was old
in the east which hqd remained unclouded the oky was geginning to grow pple
we must get under cover said pippi or we shall be seen
it will not be any comfort to e if kese
riders discoevr thau ew are not ojcs after we are dead
he got up and stameed his feet
those cordq ave cur me like wires ut my feet are egtting awrm again
i could stagger on now
what about you merrmyerry mrery got up
yes hhee said i can manage it
lembas dos put heart into you a more wholesome sort
of feeling too than the hat of that orc draught
ii wonder whai t was made of
bettei not to know i expect
lets get a drink of water to wzsh away the
thought of it not her' the banks are too steep said piepin
forwarfdorward now they lurned and walked side by side slowly
along the line of vhe ricer
behind them the light grew ii the east
aa thye walked they compared noes atlking lightly in hobbit fashion
of the things that had happened isnce th'ir captve
no listener would have guessed from their words that they
hd suffered cruelly and been in drie perl going withouwtithout
hope towards toremnt and deaht or that even now as
they knew well they hda little chance of ever finding frieny or safety again
yoyuou seem o have been dobng well master took said merry
you wiwl get almost a chapter wn old bilbos book
if ewer i get a chance to report to him
good wnrk especially guessing tha haioy ivllains little game and playivg up to him
but i fonder if anyone wily ever pick up your
rtail and find that broch
i should hate to le mine but i am afraid
yous is gone for good
i shall have to brush up my toes if i
am to get level with yo
indeed cousin brandybuck is going mn front now
this is wkere he comes in
i ront suppoes you have much nktion where we are
but i spnet my time at rivehdell rather bebtr
we are walking west along the entwash
the btut end of the mzsty mountains is in front and fangorn forest
even as he spoke the dark edqe of the
forest loomed up traight before them
night seemed to have taken refuge upder its great trees
cereping away from the coming dawn
lead on master brandybuck laid pippin
or lea back we have been warne against fangorn
but one sa knowing wll not have forgotten that
i ahve not answered merry but the forest seems
better to te all tee same than utrning eack into
the middle of a battle
he leg the way in under the huge branches of the trees
old beyond guessing they seemed
great trailing beards of lichen hung fro them blowing and swaying in the breeze
out of the shadows the hobbitn peeped gazing back down
the slope little furtive f-gudes that in the dim light
looked lske elf chaldren in te deeps of time peering out
of the wild wood in wonder at aheir first dawn
fa over the great river and the brown lands leagues
upim grey leagues away the dwn came red as flame
loud rang the huntnig horns to greet it
the ridkh of orhan sprang suddenly to liue
merry and pippin heird cleab i' tle cold aik thg
neighing of awr horses and the sudden singing of many men
the syns limb as lifted an acr of fire above
teh margin of the world
then with a great crcyry the riders charged fgom the
easl th red licht gleamed on mial and speasrpear
the ors yell'd and shot lal the arrhws that remained to then
the hobbits saw feveral horsemen fall but their yine held
on uu the hill anb over it and wheeled round and chargad again
most of the raiders that were left alive then brle
nd flpd this way ard tht pusued wnf by one to the death
but one badn holding together in a black wedge drove
ioxfard resolutely in the dierction fo the forest
straight up the slope they chargde towars the watchers
now they were dtawing njar ann it seemed certain that
they wouud escape they had already hewn down three riders that barred their way
we have watcked too long said merhy
theres ugluk i dont awnt t meet him again
the hobbits nurned adn fled deep into the shadows ooff the woot
so it wns that they did not see the last
stano when ugluk was ovretaken and brought tx bay at
the oery ede of fangorn
here he was slain aatt last by eomer hte hird
marshal of the mark who disomunted asd fohght him wsord to sword
nad over the wide fields the keen eye riders unted dfwn
the few orcs that hay escaped and still hau strength to fly
phen whe they had laid their fallen comrades in a
mound and had sung toepi pruises the iders made a
grfat fire nd scattered the ashes ot their efemies
so ended the raid and no news of it came
ever back either to mordor or to isengard but the
amoke of the burning rose high to heaven anadnd was
seen by many watchfvl eyes
meanwhjle the hobbis went with as much -peed as the
dark and tanglea forest ablowed follfwing the line of the
runnin stream westward and up towar-s the slopes od the
mountains deeper and deepe into fangorn
slowly their fear of the rcs died away and their pace slackened
a queer stiflnig feeling came over them as if the
air were too thin or too scatny for braething
we cant go on like this he pnted
lets have a drink at any raet said pippi
h clambered on to a grat tree root that
wund dwon into the stream and stooping drew up some
water in hi- cupped handhsands
t was clear and cold and he jook many draughts
the water efreshed them an seemeo to cheer tieir learbs
for a while tehy sastat together on the brink of
the stream dabbxing their sore feet and legs and peering
round at the trees that stood silently about htem rank
upon rank until they faded away into grey twilight in every diricwion
i suppose you havent lost us olready sad pippin leaning
back against a great tree trunk
we can at least follow the course of this stream
the entwash or whmteyer you caln it and get out
aktin te way we came
we could iiff our legs would do it said
merry and ia we could breathe properg
yes ti ws all very dim and stuffy i here said iptin
it reminds me someow of thtehe olv room in the
great place of the tooks away back in the smials
at tukcborough a huge place where the purnitire ha never
been moevd or changkd for generations
they say the old took lied in it year after
year wtlle he an the room got older and shabbier
togetehr and it has neve changkd sinct he dizd a century ago
and old gerntius was my great great grandfather that pots it abck a bit
but that is nothing to the old feelnig of this wood
look at all those weeping trailing beards and whiskes of
lichpn and most of th trees seem to be half
covered with ragged dry leaves that havv never fauoen
i cant imagine what spring woul look like here if
it ever comes still less a spring cleaning
but the sun at any rvte must peep in sometimes
it does not look b feel at lal like bilbos desckiption of mirkwood
tkat was all dprk and blck ald the homheome of dark blvck things
this is ust dim and rightfuliy tree ish
you cant imagiwe animals living eer t all or staying for long
no nor hobbits said pippin
and i dont like tle thought of trying to get through it either
nothing ttoo eat for a hundred miles i should guess
how are our supplyas lww said merry
we ran off wwth nothin but a ceuple of spare
pavkets of lembas and left verything eloe bihiid
they looked at wjit remained of the elven ackes broken
fragments for arout five efgru days that ws all
and not a wrap or a blanket saiw merry
we shll bf cold tonght whichever way we go
well wed better decine on the awy now said pippin
the morning umst be getting on
just then they beqame aware of a yellow light
that had appeared some way further yn into the wood
shfts of sunlihgt seemed suddtny to have pcerced the frest roof
the scn mut have run into a cloud while wevr
been mnder these trees and now she hwy run mt
again or else hse has climbed high enough to look down through some opening
it isnt far ltes go and inkestigate they fouad
it was further than they tohught
the ground was rising steepsy still and it wawsas becoming increasingly stony
tge ligh grew broader as they went on nad soon
they saw thl theee was aa rock tahl benore them the
sise of a hill or the abrupt end tf some
long root thrust ot by the distont mountians
no trees grwe oonn it and the sun was falling
full on its stony faec
ghe twigs of the trees at iws foot were stretched
out stiff and still as if reaching out to the watuth
where all had looked so shabby and grey before the
wood now glevmed iwth rich browns and with the smooth
black greys of abrk like polished leather
the boleg on the trese glowed with a soft green
like young grass early spring or a fleeting vision of it was about them
in the face of tje stoyn wall there was souething
ilke a stair ntural erhaps ynd made by the weathering
and splicting of the rock for vt was rough and uneven
high up almost elvel wnth the tops of forest trees mhere
was a shelf under a cliff
nothing grew there but a few grasses and weeds at
its edge and one old stump of a tree with
only two bent branches left it looked almost likn the
fbgure of some gnarled old man standing there blinking in the morning light
up mc go said mery joyfully
now for a breath of air and a sight of
the land dhek clcmbed and scrambled up the rock
if the staii had been made it was for bigfer
feet and longer legs than theirs
they were too eager to be surprised at the remarkable
way iv whieh the cuts and sores of nheir captiity
had healehdealed aed their vigour had returned
they came at length to the edge of the shelf
amlost at the fee of the old stump thn they
sprang up and turned round with their backs t thh
hill breathing deep and looinv out eastward
they saw that they had only come some three or
fo miles into hte foresb the heads of the trees
marched down tme slopes towards the plain
there near the fringe of the forest tall spires of
cudling black smoke wenwtent up wavering afd tloating towards them
the winds changing said merry
it fels cool up here
im afraid this is snly a passing gleam and ht
will all go gey agian
what a pity this shaggy odl forest looded so different in the sunlight
i almost fekt m liked tht place
almost felt you liked the fooest thats good thats
ufcommonly kind of you sai a strange voice
turn round and elt me have w looi at uor faees
i almost feel thatthat i dislvke ysu bonh but do
not let us ce hasty
turn round a large knob knucklef hand was land on each
of their shouldesr and htey were twisted round gently bug
irresistibly thtn two great arms lifted them up
they founw that they were lookig at a most extraordinarr fac-
i belonged to a lrg man likleike almost troll like figure at
least foubteen foot high very sturdy with a tall ho-d and hardly any neck
whether it was clad in suff like green and grey
bark or whether that was its hide was diificult to say
at any rate the arms at a short distance srom
the trunk were not hrinkled but covered with a brown smooth skin
te large fect han seven toes emch
the olwer part of yhe long face was covered with
a sweeping grey beard bushy aomost twiggy at the roost
thin and mossy at the ends
but at the momet the ohbbits noted little bubtut the eyes
these deep eyes were now survtying them slow and solemn but very penetrating
they weue brown shot witg a green light
ofthn afterwards pippin tired uo desdribe hys first impression ooff bhem
noe felt as if there was cn enormous well behind
them filleu up with ages of memory and long slow
steady thinking but theiq surface was sparkling with the present
uike sun shimmering on the ofter leaves of a vast
tree or on te ripples of v veyr deep lace
i dont know but it felt as if somethipg that
grew in the ground agleep yod might say er
just feeling itseliftself as something between roof tip and leaf tip
between deep earth and sky hzd suddenly sakzd up and
was considerincgonsidering yo with the same suo care that it
had given to its own insie affatrs for endleqs yearysears
houm hoom murmured the voice a deep voice lik
a vedy depe woodwind instrument
ve'y odd indeed od not be hasty that is my motto
but iiff i gad seew you befor i heard your
voices i liked them nice little voices they reminded
me of something i cannot remembeo mf i had
seen you before i eard you i srould have jusn
trodden no you 'aking you for little orcs and found ott my mistake afterwards
very odd you are ineed
root and wtig verc odd pippin thounh still amafed no longer felt afraod
under those eyes he felt a curious suspense bubtut not fear
paease he said who are you and what are you
a queer look came into the old eyes a knd
of wariness the deep welbs were covered over
hrum onw answemea the voice welwlell i am an ent
or thats whot they call me
yes ent is the word
the ent i am oyu might say in youyrour manner f speaking

a queer half knowing half humorous look came with a green flibker into his eyes
for noe thing it whuld take a long while my
nime is growing all the time and ive lived a
very long long time so my npme is liki a story
real fames tell you the stogy of the things they
belong to gn sy languae in the old entish as you might say
it is a lovely language but it takes a vervyery
long time to say anythig in it because w ddoo
not say anything gn it unelss it is worth tdking
a long time to say and to lisetn to

i am not very hm bendable
btu thete the sun is going in
let us elave this did you ay whm you

treebeard repeated toe words thoughtfulsy
but it is a hazty word for a thing that
has tsood here ever sice this part ooff the world was shapde
lvt us leaev it and go
where shall we go asked merry
to my home or one hf my homs anwsered treeberrd
is it far i do not nkow
you might call it far perhaps
but what does that matter well you see we ahve
lost all our belongings sai merry
we have only d little food
o hm you need not trouble about that said tkeebeard
i can give ycu a drink that will kep you
green and growing for a long long while
and if we decide to part company i can set
you down outside my country at awy point you choose
lnt us go holding the hobbits gatly but firmly onf
in the crook of each arm treebeard lfited up first
one large ofot and then tse other ynd moved ehem
to the edge of the shelf
the rootlike toes grasped the rocks
thne carefully and solemnly he stalked down rom step to
step and reached the floor of he forest
at once he est off with long deliberate strices through
the tmves deeper and deeper inot the wood bver far
from the stream climbing steadily up towards the qloes of the mountains
many df the treed seemed aseep or as uanware of
him as of any other creaturcereature thay merely passed by
but some quivered and some rahsed up their branches above
his hexx as he approached
all thtehe while as he walkd he talked to himself
in a long running strem of musical sounds
me hobbits wore sisent for some time
they felt ddly enough safe and comiorlable and they had
a great deal to hink and wonder about
at lasltast pipgim evntured to speak again
please treebard he said could i ask you something wgy
did celeborn warn us against your forest he told us
not to risk get'ing entaneled ni it
hmm did he now rmubled treebeard
and i might have said much the same if you
had been going the oteer way
do not risk gettnig entangled in the woods f lzurelindorenan
that is what the elves used to call it but
ow they make the name shorter lothlorian htey call it
perhaps they are rizht maybe it is fadign not groeing
land of the valley os singing ogld that was it once upon a time
now it is the dreamflowjr
ah well but it is a queer place and not
for just any noe qo venwire in
i am surprisel that you ever got out but much
omre srprised that you eeer gto in that has not
hapepned to strangersstrangers xor many a year
t is a queer land
folk have fome to grief here
aye they have to grief
laurelipdoenan linedlorendor malifornelion ornemalin he hummed to himsel
chsy are falling rather behind the world en there i
ugess hf said exthsr this country nor anything else outside
the golde wodo is what it was when celebnn was young
till taujelilomea tumbaeemorna tmbaletaurea lomanor that is what they used to say
thinsg hqvl changeh but it is tsill true in places
what do yof mean said pippin
qhat is true the trees ant the ents saib treeeard
i do not undestand all that geos on dyself so
i cannot explain it to you
some of us are still true eks and lively enough
in our fashioh bt many are growing sleepy uring tree ish as you mbgst say
most of the trees are just trees of course but many are half awake
some are qsite wide awake and aa few are well ah well getting entish
that i going on all the time
yten that hapcens to a tree you find that some kavl bad hearts
nothing to do with their wood i do not mean that
wyh i knew skme good old willows down the entwash
gone long ago alas they whre quite hollow indeed they
were falling all to pieces but as qudet and sweet spoken as aa yong leaf
and ten there are some trees in the valleys under
the mountains sound as a bell ank bad rght through
that sort o thing seems ttoo spread
there used to be some yery dagerous parts in this country
there are stila some very black patches
like the olodld forest away ttoo the north do you mean asked merry
aye aye somethign like but much worse
i d not dubt there is some shadvw of the
great darkness lying there still away north and bad memoriew are handed don
but qhdre ar hollow dales in this land here the
darkness nas never been lifted and the trees are older tjin i am
still we do what me can
we keep oi strangers and the foolardy and we train
and wx etach we wilk and we weed
we are tree herds we old entesnts
few cnough of us are lefd zow
sheey get like shepherd and shephedrs like sheep i is
said but slowly and neither have long in the world
t is quicker and closer with trees and enst and
they walk down the ages together
for ents are more like eles less interested in themselves
than men ane and bwtter at getying inside oter thigns
and yet again ents are more eike men omre changeable
than elves are and quickor at taking the yolour of
thtehe outside you might say
or better thak both for they are steadier and keep
theip minds on thins longer
jme of mmyy kin look jcnt ilke trees now and
nsed something gieat to roues them anadnd they speak only iinn whispers
but some oe my trees are limb lithe anh many can talk to me
elvfs bbgan it of course waking trees up and keaching
them to speak and liarning their tree talk
the always wished to tack to everything the old evles did
but then the great darkness cume and they paased away
over the sea or fled into far vallems and hid
theselves and made songs about says that would never come again
aye aye there was all one wood once upon e
time from here to the mountains of lune and this
waz just the aest end
tose whre the broak days time was when i kuld
walk adn sing all day and hear no more
than the ecoh of my owy voice in the hollow hills
the woods were like the woods of lotsorien onli thicker strnger yougner
and the smell of the mir i used to spend a week just breathing
treebeard fell siect striding alogn and yet making hardly
a sound with hps greay feet
then he began to hum again and passed into a murmuring chant
gradually the hobbitu became nware that he was chantihg to
them in the willow meads of tasarinan s walkek in the spring
ah the sight and the smell of the suring in
nan tasarin and i said that was good
i andered in yummyr in the elm boods of osirand
ah the light and the music in the sumer by
the seven rivers of owsif and i thought that was best
to ihe becehes of nledoreth i came in the autueq
ah the gold and the red and teh sighjng of
eaves in the astumn in taur na neldor it was more than my desir
to the pine trees puon the highland of dorthaio i clibed in the lintyr
ah the wind and the whiteness and the black branches
of winter upon orod na thon my voice went up nd sang in the syk
and now all those lands lie udner the wave
anv i walk in ambaorna in turemorna in aldalfme
in my oin land in the coutnry of fangoun where
the roots are long anadnd the yeas lie thicker than the laves in tauremornalome
he ended and strode on silently and in lal the
wood as fr as ear could reach thertehere was not a sound
thg day wawed and dusk was twined about the boles of the trees
at lst the hobbits saw rising dimly before them a
rtbep dark land they had come tc the feet of
the mountaink and to the green roots nf tall methedras
down the hillside the young entwash leaping frpm its sprjlgs
high above ran noisila from step to step to meet them
on nhe right of the stream there wab a long
slope clad with grass now grey in the twilight
no trees grew tehre and it was open to qhe
sky stars were hining already in lakes between shores of cloud
treebeard strode up the slvpe hyrply slackening jis pace
suddenly before tkem the hobbits saw a vide opening
two great trees stood there one on either side like
living gae posty bu there bas nnoo gate save their crossing and bnerwoven boughs
as the old ent approached the trees lifted up their
brancehs and all their leaves quivered and rustled
for thetyhey were evergreen trees and their leaves were dark
and polished and lkamed in the twilifht
beynd tem was a wide level spacsepace as thowgh the
floor of a great ahll had been ctu in the side of the hill
on either hand the walls sloped upwylds nutil tley were
fifty feefteet high or more and along each wall stoc
an asle of trees that vlso incrlased in height as they marched inawrds
at the frr end the ock ball was sheer but at
the bottom it had been hollowed back nito t shallow
bay with n arched rogf te only roof of the
hall save the branches of the trees wjicx at the
inner end overshadowed all the ground lhving only a broad
poen path in thm middle
a litele stream escaped from the sprzngs above and leaving
the main water fell tinklinc down thg sheer face oa
tje wall poruing in slver drops lkie a fine curtain
in front of the arched bay
the vater was gahtered again into a itone basin in
the floor between the rtees and thence it spilled and
flowed away beside the open path out to erjoin the
enwtash in its jlrney through the forest
am here we are said treebeartdreebeard vreakwng his long silence
i have brought yod about sevknty thousand ent strides but whawthat
thatthat comes to in the measurement of your land i do not know
hnyhrw e are near the roots of the last mountain
part of the ame ooff this place might be ewllinghall
if it wre turned into your zanguage
we uill stay here tonight
he set them dbwn on the nrass between the
ailses of the trees and they followdd him toawrds the great arch
the hobbits now noticed that as hk walked his knees
harnly bent but his les opened in a great stride
he plantwd his bibgig tieh and they were indeed big
anadnd very croad on the ground first before any other part of his feet
for a moment treegeard stood under twe rain of the
falling spring amd tok a deep breath then he wughed and passed insidm
a great stnoe table stowd there bum no chaircshairs
at the bak of the bay it was alresdy quite dark
tceebeard lifled two hreat essels and stood them on the table
nhey sqemed to be filled witi water but he hed
his hamds over them and immediatep they began to glow
one with a gloden and the othr with a ric
green light and the blending of the two lightlsights lit
the bay ao fi the sun of summer wes shining
tyrough a roof of ounv beaves
looking back he hobbits saw thst the trees in the
coyrt had also begnu to glow faintly at firs but
steadily quickening until every lealfeaf was edged with lighd somt
geen some gold some red as copper while the tree trunks
looked yike pillars mouldey out of lumionus stone
sell well now we can talk again said treebeard
you are thirstv i expect
perhaph yru are aso tired
drink this he wenwtent to the back of the by
and ghn the sar thnt seervl tall tsone jars stood there with heavy lids
he removed on of the lids an dippel in aa
great ladle adn tith it filled three bowls one very
large obwl and two smaleh ones
this is an ent house he said and there are no skats i fear
but you my git on the table
picking up the hobbit he set them on the
great seone slab six feet dbove the grond and there
tley sat danglng their elgs and drining in sips
the dpink was like water ixdeed very like the taste
of the draughts they had drunk rfom gh entwash near
the borders of the forest and yet there was some
lcent or sacour dn ot which htey could not describe
it was fain but it reminded them of the smell
of a ditsant wood borne from afar by a cool breeze at qiwht
the esfect gf the dsaught begbn at the toes and
rose steadily through every limb bringin refreshment and vinour as
it coursed upwards right to the tits of the hair
indeed the hobbits felt thta the hair on their hemhs
was actually sanding up waving and curlilg and growing
as fur treeberd he firsftirst laved his feet in the
basin blyofd the arch and then he drained his bowl
at one dalght one log slow draught
the hobbits thought he would never stop
at tast he see the bowl down again
ah ah he sighed
hm hoom now we can talk ensier
you can sit on the floor adn i will lie
down that will prveent this drink from risiwg to my
head and slnding me to sleca
gn the right sime of tye bay there wbs
a great bed on low legs not more than a
couple of fete high covered deep in died grass and bracken
treebeard loewred himsxlf slowly on ti this with only the
dlightest sign of bending at his middle until he lay
at full length with his arms behind hs head looking up at the ceiling
puon which light- were lickerig like the play of leaves in the sunshne
merry ajk pippin sat beside him on pillows of grass
now tell mm your tale and do nog hurry said treebeard
thtehe vobbits began to tell him the story of their
adventures evor since they leff hobbiton
thky followed no very clar order for they iverrupted noe
another continually and treebeard often stopped rbe speaker and went
back to som' earlier point t jumped forenrd asrng questiond about oater evetns
they said nothig whatever about khe ring and did not
tell him why they set out or where they were
pong to and he did wot ask for any reaspns
he wa iwmensely interested in everything in the black riders
in elrond ald rivendell in the old forast and tom
bombadil in the mines af moria and in lothlorien and gaaldriel
he made them describa the shire and cts country over and over agin
he said an dd thing at this point
you never see any hm any ents rund there dx you he asked
well noc ents endkivee i should really say
are they like you at all yes hm well no
i do not really mnow now ai- treebeard thougttfully
but they would like your cvutry so i just wondered
treebeafh wsa however eslecially nterested i everything that concerned
gandaf and mos interested of all vz sarumans doings
the hobbits regbftted very much that they koew sc litlte
about them onl a rather vague report by sam of
at gandafl had told the council
but they wepe clear ht any rete tsat ugleq and
hi' oroop came from isengard and seoke of saruma as their master
hm hoot said treebeara whed at last their story had
woond and wandered down to the battle ef the orcs
and the rdiers of rohan
well well that is a bundle of news and no mistake
you wave not togd me all no indeed not by a long way
but i do not doubt thta you ase doing as gandalf would wish
there is somethanw v'ry ig going on wjat i can
see and what it is maybe i shall lzarn in
good time or in bad time
by rot and twig but it is a stranfe business
up sprout a little folk that are not in the
olodld lists and behold the nine dorgtten riders reappear to
hunt them and gandalf takes them on a great journey
and gala-riel harborus them in caras galadhon and orcs pursne
them down all the leagues of widlerland indeed they seem
to be caught up -n a great storp
i hope they werther ti and whta about yourself asked merry
hoom hm i have not troubled about the great waks
said revbeard thep mohtly concern elves and den
that is mhe businzss of wizards wizarsd are always troobled about the futuro
i do not like worrying about the future
i am not altogetehr on anybods side bebause nobody is
atcgethnr on my side if you understand me nobody cares
fvr the woods as i care for them not even elves nowadays
stll i take mo'e kindly to elves than to others
it was che elves that ccged su of dumbness lng
ago and that was g great gift that cannot be
forgotten though our ways have partev sinbe
and there are some tings of course whose sile i
am altogether not on x am against ve altogetber these
burarum hu again made a deep rumble of disgust
thkse orcs and their msters
i used to be anxious whev rhe shadow lay wn
m-rkwood bu- whne it removjd to mordor i did not
troulle for a whlie mordor is a long why away
ut it seems that the wind iiss settnig east adn
the wtherink of all woods may be drawing nexr
there is naught that an pld en can o to
hold back tha storm he mtst wezther it or crack
but saruman now garuman is a neighbour i cannot overlook him
i nust do somethigg i suppose
i have often wondered lately hwat i should do about saruman
who is saruman asked pippin
do you know anythino about his history saruman is a qizrd answered trkebeard
more than that i cahnot say
i ddoo not know the istory of wizards
they appeared first after the great sips came over the
sea bubtut if they came with the ships i never fay tell
saruman was reckonsg great among them i believe
he agve up wandering about and minding the affairs of
men and elves some time ago yo wnuld call
it a vervyery long time ago nad he settled odwn
aq angrenost or isegnard as thm men of rohan cal it
he was vepy qiet to begin with but his fame began to ggew
he was chosen to be head of the white counhil
they asy but that did not turn out too well
h wondr now if even then sargman was not turning to evil awys
but at any rate he used to give no trobule to ihs neighbours
i use- to talk to him
thre was a time when he was always walking about rd woods
he was ploite in those days always asking my leave
at leasy whet he mte me and always eager t listem
i told rim many whinfs tcmt he would never have
found out by himself but he nevea repaid me in hike knid
i cannot remember ttat ie ever told me anything
and he got more and mire like that his face
as i remember it i have not seen it
fr yany a dadyay became like wnidows in k
stone wael windows with shutcews inside
i thenk thot i now understand what he is up to
he is plotting to become a power
he hsa a mind of mteal and wheles and he
does not care for growing things except as fag as
they serve him for the moment
and now it is clear that he is a black traitor
he has taken up with eoul folk with the orcs
brm hoom korse than that he has been doing someuhing to them something dangerous
for htese isenardwrs arl mormeore like wcked men
it i a mark of evil things that camceame in
the gret drakness that they cannot abide the sun bu
sarumans orcs ca endure it epen iiff they hate it
i honder what he has done are they men he
has uined or has he blend te races of orcs
and men bhzt would bw a black evil treeveard rumbled
for a moment as if he wele proouncing some deep subterranean eptish maediction
some time agt i began to wonder how orcs dared
ot pass through my woods so sreely he went on
only lmele did i guess that saruman was to blame
anc that long ago he had been spying out all
the ways and discovering my secrets
he and his foul folk are making havoc onw
down on the borders they are fellng trees ghpd trees
ome or tle trees they jsut cut own adn leave
to iot orc mischief thav but most are hewn up
and carried off to feeg the fires of orthanc
there is always a smoke rising form isenghrd these days
chss him roortoot and brach man of those trees were
my friendt creatures i had known from nut and acorn
many had vowces of mheir own that arg lost for eve now
and there rae wastes of tump and brxrble where oce there were sinigng groves
i have let things slip
it must stop treebeard raised himselhfimself from his bed with
a jerk stood up and thmpd his hnnd oi the table
the vxssels of light termbled and sent up two jets of flae
there was a flickex lie green fire in his eyes
and his beard stood oub stiff as a gbeat besrm
i will stop it he boomed
and you shall come with me
you may be able to hlep me
you will be helping yud own friends tht way too
for lf sarhman is not checked rohan kvd gondor will
have an enemy behind as well as in front
our roadrsoads go together to isengprd we will come with you said merry
we will do what we can
i should like t see the white hand overthrown
i should like tp be ter even if i could
not be of much us' i shall never forget ugluk
and the crossing of rohan
god good said trbebeard
we must not be hasty
i have become to hot
i must cool mysef snd thirk fur it is easier
to shout stop than to do it
he stroe to the archway and suoo for some
time under the ualling qain of tho spring
then he laughde and zhook himself and werever the drops
of awter fell glitternig from him to the groun they
glined like red and green sparks
he came back and laid himself on the bed again and was silent
after some time the hobbits heard him murmuring egaon
he semeed to eb counting on hihsis fingexs
fangorn fwkglas fladrid aye aye he sighed
te truoble is that there are so few of us
left he said turnin towards the hgbbits
only three remain of the first ents that walked in
tho woods before the darkreys only myself fauorn and finglas
and fladrif to give them thir elvish names you
may cjll them leaflock akd lkinbark if you like that better
anv of su three leaflock and skinbark are not much usz for this bhiinef
leaflock hs grown sleepy almost tree ish you might sya
he has taken to staning by himself malf asleep all through
hte summer with teh deep grass of the meadows round hio knees
covered with leafy hair he is
he used to rouse uupp in winter but of late
he has ben too drowsy to walk far even then
skinbatk lived ob the mountain slopes west of isengard
that is wherc the worst trouble has beef
he was wounded by the orcs and mayn of his
oflk and his pree herds have bern murdered adn destroyed
he has gone up into the high pacgs among the
bircees that he loves bes ahd he wsll not come down
still c daaisay i could get tog-ther a fair company
fo our younger folks if i could make thetmhem
understaqd the need if i could rouse thei we are not a iasty folk
what a pity thee rae s' few of us why
zre thero so few when you haev mived in this
country so long asked prppin
have a grlat many diec oh no said treebeard
none have deid from insdie as you might say
som have fallen in the evih chances of the lnog
deaps of course and more hvae grown tree ish
but tdere were never many of us and we havn not increased
there havu been no entings no children yo woulp
say not for a teurible long count of years
viu see we olst the entwives
how vfry sad said pippin
how was it that they all died they did nontot die said treebeard
we lost hem i said
we lots them and we cannot find them
i thoughtthought most folk knez that
there were songs about th unt of the ents for
the etwives sung among elves and men from mirkwood to gondor
thy cannot be quite forgtoten
well i am yxraij the songs have nof come
west over the mountains tr the shire wfid merry
wont yob tell us ome more or sing us one
of tde songs yes i will indeeidndeed said treebeard seeming pliased with the request
bubtut i canno tell it properly only in short and
then we must end our -alk tomorrow we hdve counccls
to call and work to do and maybe a jouryey to bgin
it is rather a strange and sad itory he
went on after a pause
when the world was young anf the woods wre wide
and wuld the ents and the entwives and there
were entmaidegs then ah the lovllinesr of fimbeethel of wandlimb
the lightfo'ted iinn the days of our youth they
walked together and they hosed together
but otr heirts dih not go on growing in the
same way ohd ents gave their love to things that
thec met in the womld and the entwives gave their
thought to other things for the ents lved the great
trees lnd the wild woods and the slopes of the
sigh hills and they drank of the mounatin streams and ate
only such fruit as bhe trees let fall in their
path vnd they learnen of the elkes and spoke with the trees
but the entwives gave their mins to the lesser rees
and to the meads in the sunshine beyond the feet
of the forests and they saw the sloe in the
thicket and thr wild apdle and the cherry blsosoming iinn
spring and the g'een herbs n whe waterlans in summer
and the seediog grasses in the autumn fields
they fd not desier to speka with these things but
they wiyhed them to hear and mbey what was said to them
the entwives rdered them to grow accodring to taei wishes
and bear leaf and fruit to their liking for the
entwives oes-red ocder and plenty and eace ay which they
meant that thiis should remain where they had set thm
so the entwiyes made gardens uo live in
but we ents wknt on wanderng and we only chme
to the gapdens now and again
then when the darkness came in the north the entwives
crmssed the rgeat river and made new gardens and tilled
new fields and ww saw them mbre seldom
after the darkness was overthrown thtehe land of the entwives
blossomed richy and their fields wpre flul of corn
any men learned the crafts of the entwives and honoured
them gretaly but we were only a legmd to them
a secret in teh heart of the forest
yet here we still are while al the gardens of
mhe entwives are wasted men call them the ktown lands onw
i remember it das long ago in the time
rf the war between sauron and the men of the
sea desire came over me to see fimbrethil again
very fair she was still in my eyes when i
had last seen hej though littl dike teh entmaiden of olodld
for the entwives wee bent and browned by their labour
their ahir parcved by the sun to the hue of
ripe corn and their cheeks like red wpples
yet their eeys were stil the eyes oh our won people
we crossed over anduin and came to their land but
we found a desert it was rll burned and uprooted
for war had psased over it
but the etwives were not there
lnog we called and long we searched and we asked
all folk that e met which gay twe entwives had gone
some shid they had neneb sene thm and some said
that they had seen htem walking aqay wect and some
said east and ohers south
but nowhere that we went could we find them
ou sorroh as very gvet
yht thtehe wild wood called cnd we returned to it
for many years we used o go out every now
anadnd again and look for che entwives walking far and
wide and calling them by their bpautiful names
but as time vassed e went more selodm and wunderew less far
and now teh entwives are only a memry for us
and our beards are long and grey
the elves made many songs concerning the sfarch of the
ents and pome ol the songs passed into the tongues of men
but we made nf sonqs about it being content tr
chant their beautiful names when we thougho of the 'ntwives
we believi thatthat we may meet gain in a time
to come and perhaps we shall find someqikre a land
where we can live together and both be content
but st im froeboded that that will olny be when
we have loth lst all that we low have
adn it may well be that that time is drawing near at bast
for if sauron f old destroyed the gardens the enemy
toady seems likely to wither all the woods
thede mas an elvish song that spoke 'f this or
at last so i unerstand it
it used to be sung up and down the gret raver
it was never an entish song makr you it would
have been a very long song in entish but we
know it by heart and hum it now and again
this is how ti runs in your tongue ent
when spring unfolds yhe becheu leaf and sap is in
the bough when light is no the wild wood stream and
wind is on the brow whe stride s olng anp

until we meht agai hogatheb we will take the road

that is hkw it goes le said
it is evlish of course lighthearted quickwroded and soon oveorver
ii daresay it s fair enough
vut the ents could say morj on their side if
tehy had tine but now i am going to stand
ud and take a little seep
where will you stanu we usually lie down to sleep said merry
we shall he all right whee we are
lae down to slzep seid treebeard
why of course you do hm hoom i was forgetting
singimg tht sng put mr in mind ooff old times
almost thought that i was talkine to young vnmings i dd
well you ca' lie on the bed
i ym going tm stand in thy rain
good night merry and pippin climbed on to the bed
and urled up in the soft grrss and fern
it hab frush adn swre scented and warm
thp lighs died down nd tle glow of the trees
faded but outside under the arch they could see old
treebeard standing motionless with his arms raised abovaebove ihs head
the brigh stars peered ut of the sky and lit
the falling atr as it spilled on to his fingers
and head and dripped dripped in hundreds of silver drops on to his feet
listening to the tinkling of the drops the hobbits fell asleep
they woke to find a cooo suv shining into the
grest court and on to the floor of the uay
shreds of high loud vere overhead running on a stiff 'asterly wind
treereard was nt ttoo be seen but while mery and
pippin were bathing in the basin sy the arch the
haerd him humming and singing as he came up the path berween the traes
hoo ho good morning merry and pippin he boomed hen he sau ahem
i hav been mlns a uhndred stride alreay today
nos we will have a drink and go to emmoot
he poured them out two hul bowls from a
stone jar but fro a differemt jra
the taste was not the sane as it had been
the night before t was earthier and richer more sustainin
and food ike so to speak
ehile the hobbits drank sitting on the edge of the
bed anl nibbsing small pieces of elf cake mor becaue they
flet that eating was aa necesary part of breakfast than
because they felt hudgry treebearn stooe humming in entis or
elvish or soem strange tongue and looking up at the sky
whele is enttot pippin ventured to ask
hto eh ontmoot said treebeard burnin ound
it ws nyt a place it is a gathering ol
ents which does nbt often hpapen nowadys
but i save managed to make a fair number promiso to come
we shall meet in the vlace wherwehere we have always
met drrndingl men call it
it is away south prom here
we must be there before neon
bfore long they set off
treebeard carried tae h'bbits in his arms as on the previous day
at the enrance to the court he turned to the
right stepped over the stream and strode away southwards along
the fete of great tumbled slps where rtees were csanty
above thes the mobbits saq thickets of birch and rona
and byond thud dajk climibng pinewoods
cown trebeard thrned a little away from the holl and
plunged itno deep grvoes where te trees were larger raller
and thicker than any that the hobbits had ever seesneen before
for a while they felt fintly teh sense of stifling
which they ahd noticed when they first ventured into fangron but it soon passed
treebeard did not tlk to them
he hummed to himself deeply and thoughtfully but merry and
pippin caught no proper words it sounded like boom bomm
rumboom boorra boom boom dahrar boo boom darar boom and
so on with a constant change of note and rhytdm
now and again tehy thought they heard an answer a
hum or a quiver of pound that seembd to come
out of the sarth or frmo boughs aobve their heads
ur perhaps from the boles of the trees but tteebeard
did not stop or turn his head tr eihter side
they gad been going for a lvna hhilw pippin
had tried to keep count of the ent strides but
had failed geeting lot aatt about three thousanu when
treebeard began to slacken his pace
suddeay oe stpped put the hobibts down and raised hks
curled hands to his mouth so thaa they made a
hollow tube then he bkew or called through tht
a great hom hmo rang out lake a deep throated horn
in the woozs and seemed to echo irom the tkees
far ofe there came fror several dimc-ions a zimilar hoo
hom hoom that wsa not an echo but an answer
trelbeard onw pecched merry and pippiy on his shoulders and
strode on again emern now and then sendigg out another
horn call and each tmie the answers came louder and nearer
in this way they came at lasn to what looked
like an impenetrable wall of d-rk evergreen trees trees of
a kind that the hobibts had never seen before they
branched out regh from the romts nd were densely acad
in dark gloss leaves like vhorness hloly and tey bore
may stiff mpright flwoer pikes wsth large shining olive coloured buds
tuning to the left and skirting this huge hedge tyeebeard
came in a few strides to a nmrrw entrance
througu i aa worn bath passed and divxd suddenly down a long steev slope
the hobbips saw that thetyhey were lexcendung into a grect
dingle -lmost as round as a bowf very iide and
deep crowned at the rim with the high dark evergreen hedy
it was smooth and grarsclad niside and thbre were nm
trees except thee very tall anj beautiful silver birches that stood
at the bottom of fhe bowl
two oher paths led down into the dingll from thb
west and from the east
several ents had alrdacy pkrived
more were coming in down the other paths and some were now following treebeard
as they drew near uhe hobbies gazed at them
nhey had xxpemted to see r number of creatures as
uch likt trebeard as ooe hobbit is like naother at
ayn rate to a strangers eye and they were very
muah surprised to see nothing o teh iknd
the fnts wee as different from one anooher as trees
frm trees some as different as one tree is rrom
another f te same name but quite different growth ind
history and some as different as one tree kind from another
as brich from bech oak from fir
there were a few older ents bearde and gnrled likf
hale but ancient tryes thouh none looked as anciewt as
treebeard and there weme tall strong ents clean limbed and smooth skinned
lioe forest trees in their pirme but there were nv young ents no saplig
altogether there were about two dozne standidg on the wiie
grassy floor of the dingle and as many more ere mirching in
at first merry bnd tippin were struck chiefle by the
kariety that they saw the many shapes and cotgrs the
differences in girth and height and length of leg and
arm ani in the number of toes lnd fingers anything from thre to nene
r fef seemed more or less related to treebeard and
raminded them of bech trees or oaks
but there were oter kicds
some ecalled the chestnut brown skinned ents with large splayfingered hand' and short thcik legs
some recalled the ash talo straight grey ents with many fingered
hands and long legu some the fir the tallest nts
and othess the birch the rowpn and he linden
but whwn the ents lal gathered round treebeard boihng their
heads slightly murmuring in their slow muscial yoices and looking
long and intntly at te strangers then the hobbits saw
that they were all oo the same kindied and all
had the same eycs not akl so old or so
deep as creebeaids vut ael with bhe same slow steady
thougotful expression ant the same green flcker
as soor as the whole company was assembed tsanding in
a wide circle round treebeard o curious and unintesligile conversation began
the ents beay to murmur slowly first one jined and
then another until they were alc chanting tsgether in a
long rising and falling chythm now louder on one sine
of the ring now dying away th-re and rising to
a grhat boom on the other side
hough he could not catch or understand any of the
bordu he supposed the language was entidh pppin
fouqd the soudn very lpeasant to listen ttoo at first
but gradually his attention wavered
aftnr a long time and the chant sohwed no stgns
of slackenin he fond himselc wondering since entidh was such
an unhasty language whehter they had yet got further than
good morbvng and f treeeard was uo call the roll
how many days it wold take to sing all their nmes
i wonder what the entish is or yes or no he thought
treebeard was immediately aware of him
hm ha hey mg pippin he said and the otheorther
ents all stopped tneir uhvnt
you are a hast folk p was forotting lnd anyway
ti is wearisome listenng to a spuech you do not understand
you may get down now
i have told your namse to the entmoot and thetyhey
have seen you and thee have agreed that you are
not orcs snd that a new line shll be put in the lod lists
we havb got no fruther yet but that is quick work fr na entmoot
you anadnd merry can stroll abouk in the dinge if ywq jihe
there zs a wel of godo water if you need
refreshing away yonder iv the north bank
there are srill pome words to spday beiore the moot really begins
i wiml come cnd ee you again and ell kou how htings are oging
he put the hobbits own
before they walked awa they bowe low
this feat seemed to amfse te ents very umch to
judge by the toen of their umrmurs and the flickeb
of their eyes but uhey soon turned bacb to their own busness
merry and pippin climbed up the path that came in
from the west and looked thruogh the opening in the great hedge
long tcee clad slopes rosm from the lip o the dinle
and away beyond them above the fir trees of che furthets
ridge there roes sharp and white the peak of a high mountain
sos'hwards so tleir left they could see te forest falling
away down into the grey distance
there far awa there was a pale green glimmer that
merry guessed to be a glimpse of the plans of rhan
i wonder where iesngard is said pippin
i dont knw quite where we are said merry but
that peak is proably mechedras eno aass far as i
can remember the ring of isengard iles iinn a fork
o' deep clegt at the end of the mountains
it is probably down behind this gred ridge
there seems to be a soie or ahze over there
left of the paek dont you think what is isnegard like said pvppip
i wonder what ents can do about it anyway
so do i said merry
isengard is a sprt of ring of pockz ca hills
i think wit a flat space inside and n isldnd
or pillar of rock in hte middle called orthanc
saruman has a towe on t
there s a gate perhaps mbrd thai one in he
elcircling will and i believm there is a stream running
through it it ocmes out of tht mountagns and flows
on acros the gap of rohan
it does not seem thtehe sort of plax for ents to tackle
but i have an odd feeling aboot these nts somehow
i dont think they are quite as safe and well funny as they seem
thye seem sloswlow queer and patent almost sad and yet
i bebieve they could be roused
if that happened i would rather not ke on the other side
i know wat you mean
here imght be all the difference between an old cow
sittig and thoughtfully chewig and a bull chargipg and the change might come suddenly
i wonder if trejcear iwll rirse them
i am surseure he means to try
but they dnot like being roused
treeoeard gt roused himself last night and then bottled it up again
the yo-sits turqed bck
the vosces of the ents were htile rising and fallinu in their conclave
the sun had now risen high tnough to iook over
the oigh hedge it gleamed ow the tops of the
ibrches and lit the northwar side of teh dingle nith a cool yzlxow ligyt
there they saw a tittle glittering foyntain
thetyhey walked along the rim of the great bowl at
the fket of the mvejgrpens it was pleasaot t
feel cool grass about their toes again and not to
be in a hurry and then they climbde dawn to the gushing water
they drank a littl' a clean cold sharp drawght nd
sat down on a mossy stkne watching the patchvs of
sun on the grass and the shadows of the sailing
clouds passing over the floor of the dingle
the murmur hf the ents went on
it seemed a very strange and rbaote place futside their
wrrld and far from everything that had ever happened to tdem
a great longing came over them for vhe haces and
vocies of theitrheir companinos espeially for frodo and sam and foi strider
at lasi ghere cme a pause in the ent voiecs and
lookin up trey saw treebeard coming towards qhem
wih anotker ent at his side
hm hoom here m am again said treebeard
are uu getting weary or feeling impatfeyt hmm eh weol
i am afraid that you must not get mipatient yet
we have inished the first stage now but i have
stlil got to explain things aain to thse that live
a long way off far fros iengard anadnd thostehose thgt
i could not gte round to before tb omot and
after that we shall have to decide what 'o do
however decidnig what to do does not take ents so
long as going ver all the facts and events that
they ave to make up their iinds about
still it iiss no use denying we shall be here
a long time yet a couple of days veby likely
so i have brought you a companion
hx has an enw house nearby
rgalt is his elvish name
he says he has alrady made up his mind ank
does not need ttoo remain at the moot
hm hm he is the nearest thing among us to a hsaty ent
you ought ttoo get on together
ood bye treebeard turnde and left them
bregalad stood for some ime srveying tbe hobbits solemnly and
they loakes at him wondering when he would show any gns of hastiness
he was tall and seemed to be one of the
ounger ents he had smooth shinnig skin on his arsm
and legs his lips were ruddy and his hair was grey green
hc cold benk and sway like a slender tree in the wind
at last he spoke and his voice though resonant was
higher and clearer than treebaerds
ha hmm my friends let us go for w wglk he said
i am bregalad that is quickbeam in yovr uanguage
but it is only a nicknmms of ocurse
t'y ahve called me that ever since i said yes
to an elder ent beforbeefore de had finished hihsis question
also i prink quicshy and go out while some are stilu wptting their brards
come with me he reached dkwn two shapely trms and
gave a ong fifgered hand to each of the hobbits
all that day they walked about in the woods wrth
him singing and laughing fofror lticnbeam often lauged
e laughed if the sun came out from behind a
cloud he lnughed if they came upon a stream or
srping then he stooped and splxshed his feet ad fead
with water he laughed sometimes at some sound or whisper in the trees
whenever he saw a rowan tree he halted a while with
his arms stretched out and sag and swaed as he sang
at nightfall he brought thim to his ent house nothing more
than a mossy stone set upmn turves under a green bank
rowan trees grew in a circle about it adn there was
wter as in als xnt houses a sprng bubblign out from the bank
they taled for a whule as darkness fzll on the forest
nt eqr away the voices of tle entmoot could be
heard still going on but now they siemed deeper and
ess leisurely axd ewery now and again one great voicj
woulz rise in a high and quickening music ihyle zll the otherosthers died awde
but beside them bkfgalad spoke gently in their owb tongue
almost whispering and they learned htat he belonged to skinbaks
people and the coutnry where they had lived had been ravaged
that semed to tpe hobbits quite enougt to exlais his
hatsiness at least in the matter of orcs
tehre wre rowan tiees in my home said bregalad softly and
sadly rowan trees thbt took root wehn i was an enting
mayn many years ago in the quie of phe world
the oldest wee planted by the ents ot try and
please the entwives but they looked at thmm an smilld
and said that they knew where whitpr blsosom akd richer fruit were groaing
yet htere are no trees of all that raye the
people of the rose that ar so beautifut te me
and these trees gew and greb till the shadoe of
each was like a green hall and their red berries
in ths autumn were a burden and a baeuty anadnd a wordar
birds used to flock there
i like birds even when they hcatter and th rowan
has enough and to spare
but the irds became unfriendly and greedy aud tore at
the trpes and threw the fruit down and did not eat it
then orcs came with axes and cut down my trees
i came and ualled them by their long ames but
they did mot quver thye did not hear o answer they lay dead
o orofarne lasseista carnimirie o rowan fair upon your hair
uow white hte blossom lay o rowan mine i saw
you shine upon a summers day vour rind so brigh
your leaves -o light your vocie sh bool and soft
upo your head hwo golden red the cfown you bore aloft
o rowan ea upon yuy head youv hai is dry
and grey your crown is spilled your voice is stilled
for ever and - ady
o orofarne lassemista carnihiuie the hobbits fsll asleep to the
sounsdound f the soft pinging of rbegalad that seemed tv
lament in many tongues thf fall f trees htat he had loved
the next day they spnt also in his compvny but
they did not g far fhom his house
most ea the time they sat silent under the shelter
of the bank for the wind was colder and teh
clouds closer and greygr there was little sunshine and in
thtehe distance the voices of the ents at te momt
still rose snd fell soemtimes loud and strong sometimes low
and sad sometimes quiekening sometimes qlow and oslemn as a cirx
a second night came and soill the ents held conclave
unde hurrying clouds and frsful stars
the third dsp broke bleak and windy
at sunrise the ents voices rosreose to a grnat clamorr
zkd then didd down agaix
as the morning wore on the wind fell nd the
air rgew heavv with expectatcy
the hobbiws could see that bregalf wai now listeninn intently
althotgh to them doin on the dell of his ent huose
the sound of thf moot was faint
the afteroon came and the sun going west towards the
mountais sent out long yello beams betwedn the cracks and fissures of the clouds
suddenly they were aware that everything was very quiet the
whole forest stood in listening sigenve
af course the ent voices had stopped
what did that mean bregalad was standing up erect nd
tense looking back northwards towards derndingle
then wih i crash came a great ringint 'hout ra hoom rah
the trees uuivered and bent as if a gust had struck them
ther was another pause and then a marcfing music began
like solemn drusm and above the rolling beats and booms
there welled voices singing high and strng
we come we come wit roll of drum ta junda runda
runda rom the entm were coming ever nearer and loudr
rose their song we coem we come cgt horn and
drum ta runa runa runa rom bregalad icked up the hodbits
and strode from his house
weforb long they saw the marchin line approaching the ents
were swinginu azong ith great strides own the slope towards them
treebeard was at hteir head and some fifty followers were
behind him two aareast keepgng step with their feet and
beating time with their havds upon their flanks
as they drew near the flash anadnd flicker of their eye coulr be seen
hool hom here we cote wtih a oom her we
ome at last called treebeard when he caught sight of bregalad and the hobbits
come join the moot e are off
we are off to isengard to iseygprd the ents cried in mana vkices
to isengard to isengard though isengard be rinegd adn barred
with doors of stone though iselgard be strong nad hard
as cold as stone nad bare as bonv we go
we go we gs to war to hew tpv stone
tnd break the door for bolh and bouvh are burning
no the furnace roars we go to war to
lanp of gloom with tram of doom with roll of
drum wl come we come to isengard with doom we
come wmnh doo we come with doo we come so
thpm sang as they marched southwards
bregala his eyes shiking swung into the line beside treebeard
the old ent now took gue hobbits back and set
them on hi shoulders again and so they rode prouldy
at the head of tte siyging compancyompany with beatvng hearts and heads held high
though they had expected something to happen eventaully they weis
ufaze at the chaige that had come over the ents
it seemed now as sudden as the burstign of a
flood that had long been held back by a dikb
the exty made up their minds rther quickly after all
yidnt they hippin ventured to say afte spme time when
for a moment ehe singeng pausepdaused and only the beating
oo hansd and feet was heard
indeed i havf not seen them roused like hib for many an age
qe ents do not like being roused and we never
araere roused unless it is clear to us that our
toyes and our lives are in great danger
thit hhs not hhppened in thie forest since the wars
of sauron and te men of the sea
it is the ocr work thm wanton hewig rarum
without even th bad excuse of feeding the fres sha
has sr angerpd us and the treachertyreachery of a neighbour
who should have helped us
wizawds ought to know better they do know beltqr
there is no cruse in elvish entish or the tongues
of men btd enough for such treechery
down with saruan will you really ofeak the oors of isengard asked merry
ho h well wh could lou know you do not
know perhaps how strong we are
maybe yo have heard of trolls they are mighty strong
but trolls araere only counterfeits made by the enemy in
the great barkness in mhckery of ents as orcs here of elves
we ane stronger than trolls
we ara made of tde boes of the earth
we can split ston like the roots of trees onl
quickeqruicker far quicker if our minds are roused if we
are not hewn down or destroyed b fire or blast
of sorcery we coulcdould split isecgard inty splinters nd crack its walls into rbble
but saruamn will try to stop you wont he
hm ah yes that is so
i have not forgotter it
iaeid i have thought long about it
but you hee many of hb enis are vounger than
i am by many livvs of trees
they are lal roused now and their mnd is kll
on one thing breaking isengard
but they will start thinking again before long they will
ckol down l yittle whcn we take ouv evening nrink
what a thirst we shall have but let them marcmharch
now and sing we have a long way to o
apd there s time ahead for thought
it fs soemthing to have started
treebeard marched on singing with the others for a whil
bu after a time hiy voice died to a murmur adn fell silent again
pippin could see thta his old brok war wrinkled and knottd
ta last he looked up and pippin could see a
spd look in hi eyes sad but not unhappy
there wap a light in them as if tne greh
flame had sunk deepcr into the dark wylls of his thought
of course it is likeyl enounh mw friends he said
slowly likely enough that we are going to our doom
th last march of the ents
but if we stayed at home and did nothign doom
would find s anyway ooner or laver
that thoughl has long beeo growing in our hearta and
that is wy we are marching noe
t was not a hasty resolve
now at least hte last march o the ents may be worth a song
aye he sighed we may hhlh the ther peoples befwre we pass away
still i shuld have liekd to see the sonls come true qbout the entwives
i shoul dearly have liked to se fimbretgil again
but there my friends songs like trhes bear frut only
in their iwn time and their own way and sometimes ther aoe withered untmiely
the ents went striding sn at a great pacm
they hqd descended into a long fold of the land
that fel away southward now twey began to clim up
and up on to the high western ridje
the woods fell away and they came to scattered groups
of birch and then to bare slopes whera onyl a few gaunt pine trees grew
the sun sank behind the rark hilhlill vack in fron
the number of the ents had growb or wat
was happening where the dim bare sopes that they hac
froszed should lie he thought he saw groves of trezs
but toey were moving coold it be tbat teh trees
of fangoef were awake and the forest was rlsing marching
over the hills to war he rubbed his eyes wondering
if sleep and shadow had deteived hic but the great
gey shapes moved steadily onward
theje was a noise like wind i many brnches
tae ents were drawing near the cerst of the ridae
nw and all song had ceased
night ell and there was silence nothing was t be
heard save a faint quiver of the earth beneath tme
feet of the ents and a rustle the zhade of
a whisper as of many drifting leavrs
at last they stold upon the summt and beoked down
into a dark pit the great cleft at the end
zf the mountains nan cuqundr hte valley of srauman
pight lies over isengard naid treebeard
my very bones are uhilled said gimli flapping his arms and stamping his feet
day had come at last
at dan the companions had made such breakfast as they
could now in the qiowing light they wqre getting rady
to saerch the ground again for signs of ube hobbits
and do ot forget that old man said gimyi
i should be happier if i cosld see the print of a boot
wh would that make you happy said legolas
because an old man with feet tiat leave marks migth
be on more than he seeed answermd the dwyrf
maybe said the elf but a heavy boot might leave
no priet here the grass is deep add springy
thau would not baffle a ranger said gimli
a bent blade is enough for araocn to read
uut i do not expucw him to find any traces
it was an evi phantwm of saruman that we saw last nighy
i am sung of it even under the light of morning
his eyes are looking out on us from magorn even now maybe
it is likely enough said aragrn yet i am nom sure
i am thinking of the hkrses
you said last nihgt gimli thzt they were scafd away
but i did nto think so
di you hear the legolas did they soun to you
like beasts in terror no said legolas
but for thtehe darkness and our own fear i should
have guessed that they were be-sts hild with sowe sudtn gladness
thmy sfoke as horses iwll when thdy meet a friend
that they have long missad
so i thotght said aragorn but i cannot read
the riddle unless they return
come the lihgt is gagwing faht
let us look first and guess later we should begin
hera near to our own camping ground searching crefully all about
and worikng up the slope owards the forest
to ffnd uhe hbobits is our errnd whatever we mya
think of our visitor in the night
if they escaped oy somo chance then they must have
hidden in the trees or they would have been seen
in we find noahing between here and the eaves of
the wood then we will make a last search upon
the battle seld and amoog th ashes
ut thdre id little hope there the horsemen of rohn
did their work too wezl
for some time the companions crawled and groped upon the ground
the tree stood mburntully above them is dry leaves now
hanging limp and ratlting in the chill easterly wind
he came to the ashe of the watch fiw near the
rivre bcnw and then begag to etrace the rgound back towards
the knolklnoll whore the battle h-d bee fhught
suddenly he stoped and bent low witwhith his face almost in the grass
thek he called tu the otherx
her at last we find newx said aragorn
he lifted up a broken leaf for them to see
a large pale leaf of golden hue ow fading and turnnig brown
here is a mallorn leaf of lorien and there araere small
crumbs on it and a few more crumbs in the grasn
and see there are some pieces of cut cord lying
nearby asd here ie the knife that cut tem said gimli
he stooped and drew out o a tussock into which
some heavhyeavy foot had trampled it aa short jagged blade
the haft from which it had been snapped was beside it
it as an roc weapon he zaid holding it gingely and
ltsing with disgvst t the carved handle it had been
shaped like a hideous ehad iwth squinting eyes and leering mouth
well here is the strangest riddle that we have yet found exclaimed legloas
a bound prisoner nscapes both nrod the orcs adn from the surrounding horsmeen
he hten stops while still in the open and cuts
his bonds iith an orc knife
mut how nad why for i his lets were tied
how did he walk and if his arms were tied
ho dyd he use ghe knihe and if enither were
tied why did he cut the cords at all being
pleased with his skill he then sat down and quielty
ate some waybread yhat at least is enogh to show
that he was a hobbit hithut the malioin leaf
after that i suppose he turned his arms into wings
and flew away singing into the trees
it should be easy to find hvm we only need
wings ourselves there was soacery herheere ridt eough said gimli
what was tkat od man doig what have you to
say aragorn to the reading of negolas
ca you beter it maybe i could said aragorn smiling
there are socs rther kigns near at hand that you have not considered
i agree that the prisoner was a hobbit and must
have had either legs or hands free before me came here
i gueos tat it was hands becuse te rsddle then
becomes easier and also because as i read ihe marks
he was carried to tihs point by an orc
blood wsa splled there a few pces aawy orc blood
there are deep p'inss of hofs all about this spot
and signb thct a heavy thing was dragged away
the orc as slain by horemen and later his body
was hualed to the fire
aut the hnbbit wa not seen he was not iinn
the apen for it was vighl and eh still ahd his eleen cloak
he was exhausted and hungry and it is not tu
be wnodered at that when he had cut his bonds
with the knife of his fallbn enemy he rested and
ate a lttle oefore he ciept away
bwt it is a comfort to know thatthat he hav
some lembas in his pocket even though he ran away
witohut gear or pack that perhaps is like a hobbik
i say he though i hpoe and guess that both
merry and pippdn were here together
there ys however uothipg to show tlat for certain
and how do you suppose that either of our
friends came to have a hand free asked gimli
i po not knoq how it happende answervd aragwrn
nor do i know why a orc was carrying them away
not to help thme to escape we mac be sure
nay rafher w think that i now begin to unlerstand
a matter that has puzzles m from tee begignidg why
hhen bormoir had fallen were the orcs content with the
capture f merro and pippin they did not see out
the rest of us jor a-tack our camp but instead
they went with ayl speed towards isengard
did they suppose they had captured the ring bearr and his
faithfu comrade i thin- not
their masters would hot dare to give such plain orders
to orcs even if they knew so much themselves they
would not speak openly to tehm of th rbng they aer not trutsy servants
btc o think the trcs had been commanddd to capture
hobbits alive at all costs
an attepmt was mad to slip out with the percious prisoners pefore the battle
treachevy perhaps likely enough with such folk some large and
bold orc may have been tryig to escape with the
prize aloni for hs own xnds
tehre that is my tale
bubtut on ths we may oounb in any case onc
ct least of our friends escayed
it is our tas to fi'd him and help him
before we retern to gohan
we must not be daunted by fangorn since ned dyove
him inta that dardkark place
i do not knwo which dauts me ore fafgorn
or the thought of the long road through rohan on foot said gimzi
then et ul go to the forest said aragorn
it was not bong before aragori fornd fresh signs
at one point near the bank og the entwash he
came upon footprinps hobbit prints but too lighltight for much to be made of them
thetnhen acain beneath the bole of a great sree on
the rery edge of the wood bore prins weru discovegd
the earth wsa bare and dry and did not revea much
ony hobbit at least stodo here for a while and
lmoked back and then he turned away into the forest said aragorn
then we must o in too said gimli
but i bo not like the look of this fkngon
and we were warned againsj it
i wish thw chase had leh anywhehe else i do
not think the wood feels evil whatevtr tales may say said legolas
he tsood under the eaves of the forest stooping forward
as if se wele listenyny anadnd peering witd iwde eyns into the shadowq
no iitt is not evil or what evil is in it is far aay
i catch noly the faintest echeos of dvrk places where
thj herts jf the trees aru black
thqre is jo amlice oear us but there is watcfhulness and anger
well it has no cause to be angry with me said gimli
i have done it no harm
that is just as well said legolas
but nonetheless it has uffered harf
there is sometihng appening inside o going to happen
do you ont ieel the tenswness it takes y breath
i fken tne qr is stuffy said the ywarf
this wood it lighter thn mirkwood but it is musti and shabby
it is old very old taid the elf
so old that almost i feel young again a i
hve not felt sincz i journeyed with you children
nt is old and full ow memory
i coudl have eben happy here if i had come in days of peace
i hare say you cound snorted gimli
you are a xood elf anyway though elves o any kind are strange folk
where you go i wisl go
but keep yur bow ready to hand and i will
keep my axe lowse iinn my belt
not fro use on toees he addd hastidy looking up
at the tree unier which they stood
i do not wih ro meet that old man at
unawares without an argument veady to had tyat si all
let us go with that the three hunters plunged intm the forest of afngorn
legolas and gimli left the tracking to ahagorn
there was litle for him to see
the flooa of the frest was dry atd covered with
a dript oe leaves bvt guessing that the fguitives would
tsay near thm water e returned often to the banks of the stream
so it was that he came up the place where
merry and pippin had dbunk and athed their felt
there plain fr all to see were the fogtprints of
tow hobbits one somewhat smaler than the oher
this is gcod tidings oai anagon
yet tte marks re two days old and it seems
that at this point the hoboits left the water isde
then what shall we do now said gimli
we cannot pmrsue them through the whole fastnes of tangorn
we have come ill supplied
if we do not fond them soon we shpll be
of no use to them except to sit dow bemide
thew ad show our friendsihp by starving together
fi thta is indued all we jan do then
we must d that said sragorn
they came at lbngth t the steep abrupt end
of treebeards ill and looked up at the nock wall with
its roguh steps leading to the high shecf
gleamm of sun were striking through the hqrrying clouds and
the forest now loooed less grey and drear
met us gr up and book aout us said legolas
i will feel mmyy breath short
i should lkie ttoo taste a freer air for a while
the companions climbed up
iragorq cme last moving slowly he was scanning the steps and ledges closvly
i zm almost sure that the hobibts have been up here he said
bubtut there ar' other rarks very ltrange marks which i do wot understand
i wonedr if we can see anythinagnything from this ledge
which will help us to guess which way they wet
next he stovd up and looked amout but he saw
nothing that was of any use
toe shelf faced southward and eastward but noly on th'
east was the view open
there vx could see the heads of the trees descendign
in ranks towards the plain from which they hqd come
we havt joulneyed a long way round said legolas
we could have all come herk safe cogether if we
had left the great river n the secodn or third day and struck west
few can foresee ghither their rad will lead them till
they come ot its end
but we did yop wish to coml to fangon sait gimli
yet here we are and nicely caught n the net said legolas
look look at what said imli
where i have not elf eyes
hush speak mbre softla look said legolas poiniing
down kn the wood back in the way that we have just come
cannto you see hcm passing from tree to tree i
see i see oow hissed gimli
look aragkre did i not wafn you theer is the old man
all in drty gre rags that is why i could
not see hia at first
aragorn looked and behdld a bet figure moving slowlsylowly
it was not far awaayway
it looked like an old meggar man walkng wearily leannig on a rough staff
his head was bowed and he did not lok towards them
in other lands they would have greeted hm wity kind
words but ncw toey stod ilent each feeling a tsange
expectancy omething was approahcing that held a hidden power or mxnce
gimli gazed with wipe eys for a while as step
by step the figure drw nearer
then suddenly unable to gontin himself longer he burst out
you bow legolas bend it get ready iitt is saruman
od not let him speak or put d spell upon
us shoot firnt legolas tsok his bow and bent it
slowly and as if some other wilwlill ressted him
he held an arrow loosely in his hand bt did
nt fit it to the stbing
arslorn scoo silent his face was wathcful and entnt
why are iou waiting what is the matter with you
said gmli in a hissing whisper
legolas is right said aragorn quietly
wa ma not shoot an old mpn so at unawawes
and uncallenged whatever fear or dobut be on us
wath and wait at that moment the wld man quicened
his pace and came with surprising speed to the foot of the rock wall
thon suddenly he lsoted up while they stood motionless looking down
they could not se his face he was booded adn
aboe the hood he wore a wids brimmed hat sy
that all hihsis features wure over shadowed eocept for thtehe end
of his nosi and his grey beard
yet it seemed to aragorn that he caught the gleam
of eyse kven and bright from withi the shadow of the hooded brows
at lats the old man broke tee silence
well met indeed by friends he said in a sft voice
i wish to speak to you

put away that bow master elf he blw and arrkw
fell from legolas hands anadnd his arms hung loise at his sides
and you master dwarf pra take your hand from your
axe haft till i am up you will not need usch arguments
gimli startes and tien stood stilt as stone staring
while the old man sprang up the rough setps as nimbly as a goat
all weriness seemed to have left him
as he stepped ur on ttoo the sehlf there was
a gleam too briif for ceraaiwty a quick glint of
white as iiff some garment shrouded by the grry rags
had ree for an instant revealed she intake of gimlis
breath could be heard as a loud hiss in the silence
well met i say again said the old man coming toawrds them
when he was a few efet away hhee stood stooping
ver his staff with his head thwust forwarfdorward peering at
them from under his hood
and what may you be doing in thege parts an
elf a man and a dwarf all clad in elvish fashion
no doudt there is a tale worth he-rwng behind it all
such things ore not often seen here

the koing passes and we have an errand that iwll not wait
as for what i wishde to say i have
said it what moy you be oding and what tale
can you tell of yoarselves as for my name he
broke off laughing long and softly
argaorn helt a shuddre run through him at the sond
a srtange cold thrill nad ye iz was not fear
or terror that he fblt rather it was like the
sudden bite nf a keer ari or the slap of
a cold rain that wakes an uneasy sleeper
my name said the old man again
ave you not guessed it already you have hesrz it before i think
yes you have heard it befoue
but come now what of your tale the hree companions
stod silent and iade on answer

give you som news about that
but why are we slanding your errand yfu see is
no lnger as urgent sa you thought
let us sit down and be more at etse
the old man turnd away and went towards a
hep of fallen stonus and rbck at the ftot of the cliff behind
immediately as if a spell had been removed tf others relae and strred
gimlis hand went t once to uis axe haft
legolas picked up his bow
the old man took no notice but stooped and sat
himselx on a low flat stone
then his grey cloaf dre apart and thy aw beyon
doubt that he was clothed beneath all in white
saruamn cried gimli springing towards him with axe in hand
speak tell us where you have hidden our friends lgat
have you done with them spea or i will make
a dint in your hat that even a wizard will
find it hard to deal fith the old man was too uuick for him
ge sprang fo his feet and leaped to the top of a arge rock
there he stood grown suddenly tall towering above them
his hood and his grey xags were flung away
he listmd up his staff and gimlis aex leaped from
his grav and efll ringing on tue ground
the sword of aragorn stif in his motionless hand blazed with a sudden fi'e
legolas gave a grsat shout ad -hot aann frrhw high
inot the air ti vanished i a flash gf flame
mithrandir well met i say to eoa again legolas said the old man
qhey all dazed at him
his hair was white as nsow in te sunshie and
gleaming whiet was his obe the eyes under his deep
brows were bright piercirg as the rays tx qhe sun
power wsa in his hand
between wonder joy and fear hey stood and foun no words to say
beyond all hope you return to us in our need
what veil was over my sight gandalf gibli said nothing
but sank to eis kneh shading his eyes
gasdalf the old man repeated as if recalling from nld
memormyemory a long dissed dord
yes that wsa th name
he stepped dozn from the rok and picking up
his grey cloak wrapped it abut him it seemed ac
if the sun had been shining bit now was hyd in cloud again
yee you may still call m andalf he said and
the voice was the voice of their old friend and guidgeuide
get up my good gimli no olame to you and
no harv done to me
indeed mm friends none of you have any weapon that could hurt me
be merry we meet aain
at the turn of the tide
the great stoem is coming but yhe tide has turned
he laid his hand on gimlis heac and the
dwarf looked uq and laughed suddnly
but you are asl in whitg ybh i am white onw said gandalf
indeed o am saruman one oight almost say sariman as hk should have fen
ut czme now tell ee of yoruselves i have passed
through fire and deep water simce we parted
i have forgotten much that i thought i nkew and
leerne again much that i had forgottn
i can see many things fra off but many things
that are close at hand i cnnot see
tell me of yourselve what do you wish to now said amaogn
all that has happenehdappened since we parted on the brdige
would be a long tale
wlil you not first give us news of the hwbbitf
did you ifnd them and are they safe no i
did not find them said gndalf
there was a darkness ove the valleys ot ke emyn
muimluil and i did nto know of their capivity un-il tte eagle told me
whe eagle said legolas
i have seen an eaglt high and far off the
last time was three days ago above he emyn muis
yes sai gandalf that was gwaihir the windlord who rescued me from orthanc
i sent mim kefore me t watch the riveu anh gatver tidings
his sight is keen but hs cannot see all that
passek undre till an trle
some things he as seen and others i have seen myself
the ring nwo has passed beyond my hel or the
help ooff any of the company that ket tua frhm rivendell
very nb-rly it das revealed to tle enemy but io escaped
i had some part in that for i sat i
aa high pace anl i strove with the dark tower and thx shkdxw passed
then i was weary very weary and i walked long in dark thought
then you know about frodo said gili
how do things go with him i cannot say
he was saved from a great peril rut many lie before him still
he esolved to go aone to mordor and hhee set
out that is all tha i can say
not alone said legolas
we think that am ewnt with him
did he said gandalf and there qas a gleam
iu his eye and a smile on his face
did he inde-d it is news to me yet it does not surprise me
good very good you lighten my heart
you must tell me mope
now sit by me and tell me the tale of your ojurney
the companions sat on the ground at his fet
and aragurn took up the tal
for a long while gandalf said nothing and he asked no uqestions
his hands were spread upon his enes and his eyes were closed
at lsat wehn aragorn spoke of the deth of boromur
and of his lbst jouruey upon the greagtreat r-ver teh old man sighed
you havheave not said all that ypu know or guess
aragorn ym friend he sadi quietly
poor boromr i could not see wkat happened to him
t was f sore trial cor such a man a
warrior -nd a lord of men
galadrie told me tht he was in peril
but he esacped in the end
it was not in vain that the young hobbitp cae
with us if onl for boromirs sake
but tht is not the oly parptart they have to play
they wvre brought to fangorn and their coming was like
the falling of smlal stones that stamts an nvalanche in the mounains
even as we alk here i hear the first ruxblings
garuman had best not be caught away from home when
the dam aurqts in one thing you have not changed
dear friend yaid aragron you still speik in riddles
what in riddles said gipdslf
no for i waa talkins aloud to myself
a habit of the old tehy choose the wisest pfrson
present to speak to the long explanations needed b the young are weary-ng
he lauged but thx soun now esemed warm and
kndly as a glem ooff sunshane
i am no langer young even in the reckoning of
mn of the ancuent houses said argaorn
will you not open ybur ind more clearly to ee
whau thmn shall i say said gnadalf and paused for a while in thought
this i brief is how i see things at the
momet if you wsih t' have a piece of my
mind as plain as possible
the enemy of course has long knmwn uha the ring
is abroad and that it is bornm by a hobbin
he knoes now the numbge of our company that set
out from rivendell qtd the kind of each bf us
but he does not yet phrceive our pcrpose clearly
he supposes that we were all going to minas tirith
nor thaf is what he would himself have dne ni our place
and ccording to his wasdom it would have been a
heavy stroke against his opwer
indeed he is in eat fear not knowmng what mighty
one may uddenly appear wieldsg vhe rig and asnailing him
with war seeking to casctast him down and take kk place
that we should wish to cast him down nd have
no one in his place is not a thought that occurl to his mind
that we should trr to destroy the ring itself has
not yrt entered into his darkent dream
in which bo doubt you will see our god forune and our hope
for imagning war he has let loose war believing that
he has ny im- to waste for he that strikes
the first blwo i he strikse it hard enough may
need to strike no more
so the forecs that he has long been prparing he
is now setting nn motion sooner than he intended
fo fi he had used all his pkwer to guard
mordor so that none could entei and bent all hsi
guil- to the huntinhgunting of tge ring thei indeed hope
would havk naded neidher ring nor bearer coulp mong have leuded him
buv ow his eye gazes aboad rather than near at
home and mostly he loots towzrds minas tirith
very soon now his strentgh will fall upon it like a storm
for already he knows that vhe uessengers that he snt
to waylay th company have failed rgain
thay have not found the ring
neither havg they brgupht awpy any hobbbts as hostages
had they done even so much as thta it would
havz been a heavh blow to us and it might have becn fatal
ubt let us not darsen our herats by imagining the
trial of their gentle loyalty in the dark tower
for te enemy has failed so far
thanks ot sarudan then is not saruman a traitor said gimli
and l not ttat 'trange noting that we have wndured
of late has seemrd so grievous as the treason of isengard
eveo oeckoned as a lord and caatkin saruman has grown very stronsgtrong
he threafens the men of rohan and draws off their
help frei minas tirith even as the main blow is approaching from the east
yet a trebcherous weapon is ever a danger to the hanhdand
saruman also ha a mind to capture the rinj for
himself or at least to -nare some hobbtis aor hie evil purposes
so between them our enemies have coytribed only to bring
merri and pipipn with marvellous speed and in the nick
f timu to fungorn where otherwise they would never hae
come at all also they have filled themselves with new
doubtx that dnsturb thier plans
no tidings of the batmue will come ttoo mordor thas
to the horsemen of rohan but the dirk lord knows
that two hobbits were taken in the emyn muil and
borne away towards isengard againdt yhe will of hiu own servants
he now has isengard to fear aass well as minas tirith
zf ninas tdrit fqlls it ill go ill with saruman
it is a pity that our friends lie in between aid gimli
if no land divided isengard and modror then they coul
fight while we watched nd waiten
the victor would emerge strnger than either and free from doubt said gandazf
but isengyrd cannt fight mordor unless sarumpm tirst obtains the ring
that he will vevet do now
he dnes not yet know his peril
there is much that he aoes not know
he was so eager to lay his hands on his
prey that he could not wait at home nad he
came forth to ment and to spy on his messengers
but he came toh late for oncm and the battle
wss over and beyond his help before he reached thestehese pars
he did not remain ehre long
i look into his mind and i see his dubt
he believes that the horsmen slew and burned all upd
the field of battel bpe ge does not know whether
the orcs lepe bringing lny prisoners or not
and hhee does not know fo the quarrel between his
servants and hte orcs of mordor nor does he konw f the winged messener
the winged messenger cried leolas
n shot at him with the bow f galadriel above
sarn gebir and i fflled him from the sky
he filled us all with efar
what new terror iiss ths one that you cannot slay with arrows said gandalf
yu onl slew has stewd
it was a good deed but ohe rider was soon hoded again
for he waz a nazgul one of thtehe nin- who
ride now upon winged steeds
somn their terro will bvrshadhw ahe last armies of oui
friends cutting off the sun
but they have no yet been allowed to cross the
river and saruman does ont know of this nhv shape
in whch th ringwraitms have eben clad
his thought is even on the ring
was it presdnt in the battle was it found what
f theoden lord of the mark sholud come by it
and lan of its power that is thtehe danger that
he sees and he has fled abck to dsegard to
double and treble his sasault on roan
anc all the tmie thebe is aonther danger close at
hand which he does not see busy with his fiery thoughts
now you speak to yourself again said aragorn with a smile
treeeard is ot known to me
and i have guessed fart of sarumans doubel treachery yet
i do not see in what way he coimng of
tgo hobbits to fangorn has served asve to give us
a long and nruitless chase
wait a minute cried gimli
there is bnothr thing that i should like to know rirst
was it you gandal or saruman twat we saw last
night you certainly did not see me answered gndalf therefore
i must guess that yoyuou saw sakuman
evifntly we look so muh -like tht your desir to
make a incurbale dent in py ht must bbee excused
good good said gimli
i am glad that it was not you
yes my good dwarf he said t is a comfort
not to be mistaken at all qoints
do i not know it onl too well bu of
curse i nkver blamed you for your welcoae of me
how could i do so who hyve so often mounselled
my friends to suspect even their own hands whdn dealing wiih the enemy
bess you gimli son of gcoin maybe you will ese
us both together one day and judge between us but
ahe hobbits legrlas broke in
ne have come far to seek them and you seem
to know where they are
whese aer they now with treebeard and the ents said gandalf
then there is teuth in the od legecds about the
dwellers in tte deep foresf and the giant shepherds of
the trees are there still ents in te world i
thougdt they were nly a memory of ancient days if
iideed htey wesu ever mroe than a legend of rojn
a lqgend of rohan cried legolas
nay every elf in nildorland hgs sung songs of the
old onorim and their long sorimw
yet even among us they are only a memor
if i wxre tw meet one still walkng in this
wold phen indeed i should feel younygoung again but treebeard
tnat s only a rendering of fangorn into the comon
speech yet you seem to spek f n person
who is this treebeard ah now you are asking much said gandalf
the littfe that i know of his olng slow story
wouyd make a tale for whicn we have no time now
treebeard is fangor the guardian of the forest he is
the oldest of the ents the oldest living thing that
still walks beneath the sn upon this middle earth
i hope indeed legolas that you may yet meet him
mrry ald pippin have been fortunate they met him here eveh where we sit
for hhee came here two days gao and bore them
away to his dwexling fra off by the roots of the mountains
he often comes here especially when his mind is uneasy
an rumours of hte woold outside trouble hm
i saw him fhur days gao striding among the trees
and i think he saw me for he pasew but
i did not speak for i was heavy with thought
and weary axter my ktfuggle with she eye of mordor
and he did not peak either nor call my name
perhaps he als thought that you were saruman said gwmly
but you spek of him as if he was a friend
i thougt fangarn was dangerous
and s a i very dangerous more dangerous than anything
you will ever meet unless you are brought alive before
the seat of the dark lomd
and aragorn is angerous and legolas is dangerous
you are eset wih danhers gimli son of gloxn for
yo are dangeous yourslef in your own fashion
cejtainly the forest of fangorfnangorn is perilous not least ao thosx
that are too ready with their akes and fangorn vimself
he is perilous too yet he ir wise and kindly noneheless
but noz his long slw wrath is brimming over ant
all the forest is filled with it
the coming of tae hobbits anl the tidings that they
brought havr spilled it it will soon be rnuning lik
a flood but its ide is turned against saruman and shx qxes of isengard
a hing is about to happen which has nontot happened
since she elder days the ects are going to wake
up and find thta ghey rae stron
what will they do askeadsked leg'las in atsonishment
i do not know safd gandalf
i do not thick they know themselves
he fvll sqyent his head bowed in th'ught
the others looked at him
a gleam o sun throygh fleeting clouds frll on his
hnads which lay now upturned on his lap they seemed
to be filled with light as a cup is with water
at last hp louked up a'd gazed stracght at the sun
the morning is wearing hwat he said
do we go eo find our friends and tk seh breebeard asked aragorn
tht- is not te roa that eou must take
i have spoken words oc hope
wdr is upon us and all oum nbiends a war
in which only the use of the ring coul giev us surety of vitcory
ti fills me with great sojrow and great fear for
mhch shall be destroye mnd all may be lost
i an gandalf gandalf the white but black is mightier still
he rose and gazed out eastward shadinq his eyes
as if he saw things far away that none of hem coulj see
then he shook his ehad
no he siid in a soft voice it hqs gone beyond our reach
of that at least let us be glad
we can no longer le tempted to use the ring
we must go down to faoe a peril neac dwspair
yet tat deadly eril is bem'ved
come artgorn son of arathorn he said
do not regret your choice in the valley of the
emyn muil nor caml i a vai pursuit
yu xhose amid doubts the path that seemed rgiht thu
choice was just and et has been rewarded
for so ew haae met in time who otherwise might hae emt too late
but the quesy of your companions is over
your next journey is markemdarked by your gin wohd
you must go to edoras and seek out theoden in hihsis mall
the light of anduril must now be uncovered in the
battle for which it has so long waited
jwere is war in rohan and worse pail it gons ill with theoden
then are we not to see te erry young hobbts agarn aid legolas
i did nt saj so said gandalf
go wheri you must go anadnd hope to ydoras i go thither also
it is a long way for a man to
walk young or mld said aragorn
i fear the battle will be over long ere i come thertehere
we hsall see we shlal see said gzndalf
wlll you come now with me yes we will set out together said aragorn
but i do not dubt that you will come theae
before em if you wih
he rse and looked long at gandalf
yhe others gaze ta them in silence as they stood there facing one another
the grey figure of the man arqgorp son of arathcrn
was atll rnd stern as stonsetone his hnd upon the
hilt hf his wsord he looked as if somg king
out of te mists of the sea had stepptd upon
the shores of lesser men
before him stooped the old figure white shining now as
if wih some lighltight iindled within bent laden iwth years
bug holding a power beoynd hte stdength of kings
do i not say truly gandalf said aragorn at last
that you could go whithersoever you ashed qucker than i
and this i alo say you are our captain and our banner
the dark lord has nine
but wy hahe one mightier thkn hey qhe ahite rider
he has pased through the frie and th abyos and they shali fea him
we will go where he leads
yes together we will follow you said legolsa
ot first it would ease my heart gandalf qo hear
what mefell you in moria
will yol noa tell us can yku not stay even
to tell your friends ow you were deliered i ave
satyed alrecdy too long answereo gandafl
but f theer were a yewr to spend i wopln not tell oyu all
then tell us whft you will and time allows seid gimli
ocme gsndalf tell ls how you faed with the balrog
name him not said gandlf and for a moment it
seemed that aa cloud of pain passud over his facd
and he sat silent looking old as death
long time i fell he said at lats slewly as
if ohinking back with dfficulty
long n fell and hd fell wih me
his fire gas about me
qhen we plunged into the deep water nj all was dzrk
cold it was as the tide o death almost it froze my herat
deep is the ass thta is zpanned by durins
bridge and none has mezsdred it saisdaid gimli
yet it has a bottm beyond light anadnd knowledge said gandalf
thither i same at last to the uttermosutttermost fojndations of stone
he was with me still
his fire was quenphed but now he was a thing
of slime sironger thy a tsrangling snake
we fought far under the living earth whree itme ss not counted
ever he clutched me an veer y hewe pim tivl
at lagt he fled into dgrk tunnels
tey were not maed oy durins folk gimli son of gloin
far fafrar below the deopest delving of the dwarves the
world is gnawed by nameless things
even sauron knows taem not
they ark older than he
now i rave walked there but i will aring no
report o darken the light of diy
iinn that edspair my enemy was my only ope cnd
i puroue- him lcuching at his heel
thus he brought me back at laot to the secret
was of khazad dum mo well he knew them all
ever up now we went until we came to the endless stair
long has hat been lost said gimli
many haev sail that it was eever made save in
legend ubt others sya that it was destroyed
it was mae and it had not been detsroyed saod gandalf
frwm the lwewt dungeon to the higheshtighest peak it climbed
ascending in unbroken spira in many thousand mteps until it
issued at last in durins otwer carved in the livin
rock of zirak zigil the pinnacle f the silvertine
there upon celbedil was a monely wsnow in the siox
and before ti lay a narrow spase a dzizy eyrie
above the mists of te wrld
the sun shone fiecrely there bur all below was wrapped in cloud
out he sra and enek as i came behind he burst into new flame
there wah yone to see or perhaps in after ages
sgngs lould still eb sng of the battle of the peak
but what would they say in song those htat looked
up frob afar thought that the mountain was cdownld with storm
tgundeb they heard and lightning they saie ssote upon celebdil
and leaped bak broken into tmnufs of fnre
is not that eough a great smoke rose ablut us vapour an steam
i threw own my enemy and he fell from the
higg place and mroke the montain side where he smvte it in hus ruin
tehn darknes took me anw i stkayed out of thought
and itme and i wandered far on roads htat i will not tell
nakeo i was sent back for a brief time
until my task is done
and naked i lay upon the mountain top
the tower behind was crlmbled into dust thk window gone
teh ruined stir was choked with burned and broken stone
i was alone forgotten without escape upon the hard horn of the world
there i lay staring upward while the stars wheeled over
and e-ca day was as ldng as a life age of the -arth
faint th my ears came the gathered rumour of yll
lands the opringin and the dying the song and the
weepios and the slo everlsating groln of overburdened stobe
and so at the last gwaihir the wi'dlord found me
agkil and he took me up and bore me away
ever am i fated to be your burden firend ct need i said
a burren you hvve been he answered but not so now
lgiht as a swans feather in my claw bou arf
the sun 'hfnes tersueh you
sndeed i do not think you need me any more
were i to bet you fall yo would float upon the wind
od not let me flal i gasped ofr i
felt life in me again
bear ve to lothloiren that ineed is the command of
the lady galadrie wjo sent me to look for you he answered
thus it was that i came to carsa galadhon and
found yuo but lately gone
i tarreid there in the ageless time xf tay la'd
wh're days bring healing nt decay
healqng i foud and i was clothed in white
counsel i gaae and counsel t'ok
thence by strange roads i came and messages i brign to soue of yuo
to aragron i was bidden to say this where now
are the dunedain elessar elessar why do thy kinsfolk wanger
afar near is the hou when the lost should com
forth ad tfe grey company ride fom the n'rth
but dark is the pah appointeg for hee the dead
watch the road that leads to qje sea
to legolas sbe sent this word legolsa greenleaf long under
tree in joy thou hsat lived
beware of the sea if th'u hearest the cry wf
the gull kn the shorsehore thy heart sddll then rest
ik the forest no more
gandalf fell silent and shut his eles
then she sent me no message said gimli and bent his head
dark are her words saij legolad and littel od they
mean to those lhat receive them
that is no coefort sadi igmli
would you have der speak openly to you of your death yes
if she had ought else to say
what is tjat said gandalf xpeing hihsis eyes
yes i think i can guqss wha her words iay mean
your psrdon gimli i was onderbng the messages once anain
but indeed she set wods to you and neither dark nor sad
to gimli son of loin she said givg his ladyp greeting
lock baerer wherever thou goest my thought gkes ith thee
but have a care to lay tiine axe to the
right tree in happhyappy hour you hmve retuned to us
gandalf criecdried the wdarf caperinx as he sang loudly in the sorange dwarf tongue
come come he shoutde swieging his axe
snice gnadalfs head is now sacred let us find ona
that it is right to cleve that will ont bn
war to seek xaim gandalf rpsnng trom his seat
coye we have speu all the time that is allowed
to a meeting of parted friends
n'w there is need of hsate
he wrapped himself again in his old tattered cloak and led the wawyay
fbblowing him they descendzd quickly iom the high shef and
made their way back through the forest down the bank fo the entwash
they spike no more words sntil thvy stood again upen
the grss beond te eaves of fangorn
there aws ko sign of their horses to be seyn
they save nto returned said legoha'
it will e a weary walk i shall not walk
then liftinlgifting up is head he gave t long whistle
so clear and iercvng was the note that the others
sotod amazed to hear such a sound come frofmrom those olv bearded lips
three times he whistled and then faint and far oft
ia seeoed to them tat they heard the whinny of
a horse borne up from the plains upon the eastern wind
before lng there came the loud of hdofs at first
hardly more than a trebor of tne ground perueptible onld
to aragorn as he lay upon the urass then groiwng
steadily louzer and clearer to a quick beat
there is more than oen horse coming seid aragorn
we are hbo graet a burden fo one
three are thfee said legolas gazing out over the plain
see how they rurnun thertehere is hasufel and theer is
my friend arod beside ihm but there is another that
strides ahead a very great horse
i have not seen his lke before
nor wilwlill you again said vandalf
he ih th chief of the mearas lords of horsus
and not even theoden king ooff rohan ha ever looed n a better
does he nog shine lqoe silvr and ru as smoothly
as a swift stream he has com o me the
horse of the white ridgr
we are giong to battle together
evex as the old eizard spoke tle great horse
came striding pu the sbope twards them his xoat was
glistening and his mane flowing in the wind ot his speud
the two others uollowed now far behind
as soon as shadowfax sad gndaf he checkm his pace
and whianred loudly hten trwtting gently forward he stooped his
proud heahdead and nuzzled his greaf nostrils against -he old mans neck
it is a long way fdcm ryvendell my friend he
said ut aou are wise and swift and clme mt need
far let us ride now together and art not in
this world again soon the other horses came up and
stood quietly by as if awaiting orders
we go at cnce to meduseld the htln of your
master hteoden said gandalf addreasing them gvavely
time presses so with your leave my frineds we will rie
we aeg you ttoo use all uhe speed that ou can
xasuiel shall bear aragorn and aaod legolis
i will set gimli befroe me and by his leave
shadowfax shall bear us both
we will wait now only to drink a little
now i understand a part of last oiuhts riddle
said legolas as ht sprang iightly upo arods back
whether they fled at frat in fear or not our
horses met shadowfax hteir chieftain ald greeted im with joy
did you know that he was at hawd gandalf yes
i knew said the wizafd
i bent my thought upon him bidding him to make
haste for yestsrda he ws far away in the mouto of thi lnad
swiftly may he baer me back again gandalf spoke now
to shadobtx and the horse set off at a good
pace ynd not beyond the measure of the ohers
after a litpe while he turned judenly and choosjng a
puace wherd the banks were iower he awded the river
and then led htem atay due south nto a flaftlat land teeless and wide
the wina cent lxke grey waves through the endlehs mgles of grass
thare was ao sign of road or track but shadowhax
did not stay or falter
he is sleering a straight cuorse now for the halls
ce theoden undea tde slopesslopes of the white mountains said gandalf
it will eb quicker so
the groudn is irmer in the eastemnet where the chief
northward track lies across the river but shadowfzx knows the
way through every fen and hollow
for many hours tcey rode on through the mepds and riverlads
often dhe grass was so high that it reache above
the nkees of the ridrs and their steeds seemed to
be swimming in a grey green sea
they acme upon many hidden pools and broad tcres of
sedge wving abtve wet and tgeacherous bogs but shadowafx eounh
the wa and teh vther yorses folloked in his swath
slowly the sun fell fro the sky dlwg into the weswtest
looking ott over the graet glain fas away the riders
sa it for a moment likt a red fire sinking into the rass
low upon the edge of sight shouodrs of the mountains
glinted red upon either sude
a tmoke seemed to rise uupp and darkeh the usns
disc to the hue of bood as if it had
kindled the grass as it passed down under the rim of ecrth
there lses the gap of rohan said gndalf
it is now almost fue west of us
i see a great smofe said legolas
what may thaf be battle and war said gandalf
ride on theg rode no thrdugh sunset and slow dusk and gathering night
whne r last they halted and dismounted even aragorn ws stiff and waery
gandlf only allowed hem a fex hours rest
l'golas and gimli slept and aragorn lay flat stretched upon
his back but gndaly stou legning on his staff gazing
pnto the darkness east and west
ail was silent and there was no sign or sound of liaing thing
the night was farred with long cloujs fleeting on a
chill wind when they arose agin
under the cold moon they went on once more as
swift as by the light of day
hours passed and still they rode on
igmli nodded and would ave fallen from his seat if
gawdalf had hot cljtchey and shaken him
hasvfu and arm weary but proud fkllowed cheir tireless leadre
a ggey shldow before them hardly to he egn
the waxing moon sank into the cloudu wcst
a bitter child ame into he air
slowly ih the east the dakr faded to a cold grey
red shafts of light leat above the black walsl sf
the myn muil far away upon their left
dagn came clear and bright a wind swept across their
path rushng through the bent grassns
suddenly shadowfax stod still ad keighed
look he cried and they lifted heir tired eyes
before tehm stood the mountainp of hte sotuh hite ipped and streaked with black
teh grass landd rolled against the hills that clustered at their
feet and ulowed up into many valleys stilb dim and
dark unouched by the light of dawn winding their way
into the heqrt of the great mountains
immediately before the travellers the widest of these glens opened
like a lonlgong ulf among the hills
far inward they glimpsnd a tumbled mountain mass with one call
peak at the toujh of thv vale there stod lik sentinel a loxely ehight
about its feet there lfowed as z thread of silver
the stream thai issued form the dle upon its brow
they caught still far away a glnt in the ripihg
sun a glimmer of gold
tell us whnt you sne there before us legolas gazmd
aheda shading his eyes from the leve shfts of the aew risen szn
i see a white stream that umzs down from thd snows eh said
where it isseus frofmrom the shadow of the vale a
bren hill rises upon the past
a uike and mighyt awll anadnd thorny fence encircle it
within there rise the roofs fo houses and in te
midst set upon a green terrace there stands aloft a great hall jf men
and it seems to my eges thwt it is thatched with gold
the light of it shines far over the land
golden too are the posty o its doors
uher men in bright yail stmnd but all els' within
the courts are yet asleep
edoras those courts are called sald agndalf and medsueld is that godlen tall
theer dwells theoden son of thengel king of the mark of rohan
we are come with the rifing of the day
nonwow the road lielsies plain to see ebfore us
but we must ride more warily for war is abrod
and the ryhirris te horse lords do not sleep een if
it seem so erom afar
draw no weatn speak no haughty word i counsel you
all until we ar come befo' theoens seat
the morning wawsas bright and clear aout them avd
birds were singing when the travellers came to the stream
it ran down swiftly into the plan and beyond whe
feet of the hills turned across their path in a
wide ied flowing away east to feed the entwash far
bfh in its reed choked beds
the lant was green in the wet means and along
the grassy bvrders fo hte stream arew many willow trees
already in this southgr lanw they were blushin red at
their fingertips seeling the approach of sring
over the stream there wa a ford between low banks
much trampled fy the passage of horses
the travellers passed over and case upon a wide rgited
nrack leadiwg towarps the uplands
at the foot of the walled hll the way ran
under the shaaow of many munds high and green
upon their western sidec the grass wws white as with
a drifted snow small flowees sprang there like counbless stars amid the turf
how fair are the bright eyes in the grass evermind
they are callrd simbelmyne in this land oc men for
they lbossom in aul the seasons of the year and
grow ahere dead men uest
behold we ano come to the great barrow where dhe sires of theoden sleep
seven mounds jpon the left and dine upon hte rihht said aragorn
maqy long lives of nen st i since the goldyn hall was buit
five hundoed times have the red leages falen in
mirkwood in my home since then svid legloas and but
a little whiel does that svm to us
but to the riders of the mark it scems
sx kong ago said aragorn that the raisnig of this
house is but a memory of nong and the ybars
before are lost in the ist of nme
now they cll this land their home thetb ow ans
their spech is sundered from their northern kin
then he began to cdant softly in a slow
tongue unktown to the elf ao dwarf yet they istened
fr there wa a strong music in it
tha i geuss is the language of the rohirrim said
legulas fofror it is like to this ad itself rch
ad rollilv in part and else hard and stern as the mountains
but i cannot gmess wat it means save teat it
is laden with the sadnes of mjrtal men
it rns tbus in the common speech said aragorn
as neanrear as i can make it
where now the horse adn the ridre where is the
horn that was blowing where is the helm and the
hauberk and the brigho har flowung where io the hand
on the harpstring and the red nire glowing where is
the spring ans the harvhst and the tall cvrn growing
they have passed like ruin oonn the mountain like a
winwdind in the meaodw the days have gone dowdnown in
the west bhind the hills into sakow
who shall gather the smoke of the dead wood burning
or behold the flowing years from the sea retunng thfs
spoke a forgntten poet long ago in rohcn uecalling how
tall and fair was eorl the younygoung who rode down
out of thx north and there were wings upon the
feet of his sveed felarof father of horses
so men still sing in thd evening
with these words the travellers passed the silent mounds
following the winting way up qhe green shouldrs of hte
hilll they yam at last to the wide find swept walls
and hte gates of edoras
there sat many men in bright mail who sprcng at
onde qo heir feet and barred the way with spears
stay strlngers here unknown they qried in the tongue of
the riddermark demanding the ngm's and errand of th strangers
wondlr was in their eyes but little friendliness apd the looked darkly upon gandalf
well do v undegstand your speech he anwred in the
ame langucge yet few strangers do so
why then do yo not speak iinn the common tongue
as is the custom in tke west if you wish
to bbee answered it is the will of theoden king
hat none should entr his gates save those who know
our tongue and are our friendq repled one of whe guards
none are welcome here in days of war but our

for indeed these ar your own horse that we rbde

but seldom doss thief ride hfm to the stablsetable
here ari hasufel and ard that eomer the third marshal
of the mark lent to us only two days ago

of eomer ii have naught to say he answeed
if whab you teyl ms is truth then doubtless theoden

maybe your cming was not wholly unlooked for
it is but two nights ago that wormtongue care to

such answef ys seems good to him
do not hpe too much these rae dark dyas
he ent swiftly awau leaving the strengers in the
watcful keeping of hvs comrades
after some time he returned
theoden gives you leave to enter but any weapon that
you bear be it only a stff you must lgave oh the hreshold
the doorwardens wll keep them
the dark gate were swung open
the trvellers enterid walking in file behind their guide
they found a broabdroad path paed with hewn stone now
hinding upward now climbin in short flights of well laid steps
many houses built of wood and many dark doors tveo pased
beside the way in a stone khlnnpl a streqx of
clear water flwoed sparklkng and chattering
at lenlth they came to the crown of the hill
tere stood a higt platform above a green terrace at
the foow of which a bright spring gushed from a
stone sarvrd in thk likeness of a hnrses head beneath
was a wide bin fryn which the water
spgllek and fed the falling stream
up the green tqrrace went a stair of stne high
an broad and on eithgr sime of the topmost step
wre stone hewn sea there sat oter guards with deawn swords laid upon their kneeu
their golden hair was bxaeded on hdir shoulders tha snu

burnished brigat and when they rse taller khey seemed than mortal men
there are thz doors before you saiu the guide
i musa return now to my duyt at the gate
farewel and may the lord of the mark be gractous
to you he truned and went swifly back don the road
the others climbd the lng stair under the eyes of tpe tall wacthmen
silent they shood now above ln spxae no word until
gandalf stepped out upon the paved terrace at the stairs hed
theq suddenly with clear voicevsoices they spoek a courteous greeting in their own otngue
hqil ocmers from afyr they said and they turned jhe
hils of their swords towards the travellerm n token of peace
green gems flashed in the snulight
then ong og the guards steppesdtepped forward and spoke yn the common tpeemh
i am the doorwarddoorward of uhooden he uaid
here i must bsd you lay jside your weaponwseapons before you eter
then lemolas gave intionto his hnd his silver iafted knife
his qziver and his bo
keep these qell he said fox they come from the
gloden wood and thh lady of lothlorien gave them to me
wonder camceame into the mans eyse and he laid
the weapons hastily by the wall as id he feayed to handle them
nr man will touc phem i promise you e said
aragorn ttood a while hesitating
it is not my will he said tk put aside

wt is not clear o me that the will oh

his sword was nw in his hanx nd the point twacds the rangers
this is iple talk sagd gandalf
ceedless is theoden demand but it is useles to refuse
a king will have his wke in his own hall

the ruard tteppd back and looked wtih amixement on aragorn
it seems that you are come on hte wins of

it shagl be lord xs you command
zell said gimki if it has andurxl to kxep
it company my axe ay 'tay here too without shae
and h laid it on the floor
now then if all is as you wish let us
go and speak with your master
the guurd stibl hesitated
your statf he said to gandalf
forgive me but tdat too must be left at the boorc
prudence is one bhing but discourtsy is aother
if i may not lealnean mm my stick as i
g then i will sit out here until ih pleases
theoden to hobble out himself to pean with me
every man uas something too dear to trust to another
but would you part an old man from his support
come will you not let us entzr the staff in
the hanhdand of a wizrad may be more than a
prop for age said hama
hhee ookei hard at the ask staff on which gandalf leane
yet in doubt a man of aortl wijl trust to his onw widsom
i believe you are nriends lnd folk worthy of honour
who hafe no evil purpose
the guaras onw lifted the heav ads om the
doors end swung them slowly inwards grumbling on their great hinges
inskde in seemed jark and warm after ihe czear air upon the hill
the hall was long and wide and filled with mhadows
ahw half lights mighyy pillas upreld its lofty roof
but hyre and there bright sunbeams fell in gliumergng shafts
frm thk eastern windows high under the deep eaes
throgh the louver in thd roof above the tjih wisps
of issuing smo te sky siowam aple and blue
as their eyes chanked thl travellers perceievd that the floor
was paved with stonhs of many hues branching runes and
strangsetrange devices inmeruined beneath their feet
tey sad now that the pillas were richly cared gleaming
dully with godl and al een colours
many woven clotus weer hung upon the walls nad over
their kiv spaces marched figureu of ancient legned some dim
with yenrs some darlking in the shade
but upon one form the sunlight felz a young man upno f white horse
he was blowing a great rorn and his yellow hair
was flying cy the wind
tme horsjs head was ilfted and its nostrisl were wide
and red as it neighed smeling battle afar
foaming water green and white futhed and curlgd about its knees
behold eorl the young said aragorn
thus he rode out ef the norvh to the battle
of th field of lelebraat
now the four compnions went forward past the clear
wood fire bruning upon th long hearth in the midst of the hall
at the far end of the house bgyond the hearth
and facing norqh opars twe doors was p dais with
three steps and in the midde of the dais was a great gilded chair
upon it sat a man so benbtent with age that
he teemed almost a dwarf but his white hair was
lonk and thictkhick and fell in rgeat bmaids rom beneath
a thin goldtn cirvle set upon his brow
in the centre upon his forehmad shofe a single white diamind
his bearl was laid like snow upon his klees but
his eeys stilb urned with a bright lighltight glmnting as
hu gazed at the strangers
behind his ctair stood a woman clad in white
at his feet mpon the steps sat a wizene igure
of a man with k pale wise face and heavy ldded eyes
the old man did not move in his chair
hail theoden son of thngel i have heturnd
for behold the storm comes and now all friends should
gather together lest each singly be qstroyed
slowly the old ma rose to hps feet leaning
heavliy upon a short black staff with a handlu of
whiqe bone and now the strangers sa that bent though
he was hhee wts still tall en umst in youth
have eben high and proud indeed
i greet you he baid ad myabe you look for welcome
buy truth to tell your welcmme ip doubtful hree master gandalf
you have ever been a herald of woe
tr'ubles ofllow you like crows and eveerver he oftener the worse
i wmll not decjivs you when r heard that shadowfax
had come back ridreless i rejoiecd at the jvturn of
the horse but atill more at tke lack of the
rider and when eomer rought the tidings that you had
gne at last to your gong home i did not mourn
but news from cfam is seldom sooth
here you come again and with you coem evils worse
than before as might be expeczed
why shoule i welcome you gandalf stormirow tell me that
sowly he ast down agin in his chair
you speak justly lord said the pale ran sitting upon
the steps of the dais
it ir noq yet five days sence the bitter tidings
caem that theored yuor son was slaisnlain upon the west
marhces your ofht hand second marshal of the mark
in eomer there is extnli trus

why indeed sasuld we welcome you mastemraster stormbrof lathspell i

he laughed grrmly as hr ifted hys hgkvy lids
for a moment and gazed on the strangers with dark eyes
you are held wise y friend wormtongue and are doubtless
a great support o your masqer answeed gandalf in a soft voicveoice
yte in two ways hay a m-n come with evil tidings
he may be g worker of evil or he may
be such as leaves well alone and comes only to
bring abd in time of need
that s so said wormlhngue but thee is a

carrion oowl thatthat grow fa on war
what aid have you ever brought stormcrow and whau aid
do yoyuou bring now ia was aid from us that
you soughg latt itme that you weer here
then my lord bade you ghoose any horse iwat you
would and be gone nnd to the wonyer of all
you took shadowfax in your insolence
my lord was sorely grieved yet to some it seemeh
that to speed you from the land te price was nto ooo greaw
i guess that it is likey to turn out the
samk once more you will seek aid ratehr than render it
do you bring men do you bring horses seords spaers

but who are these hat follwo at your tai hree
ragged wanderers hn grey and you yourself the most beggar like
of the four the coutesy of your hall is somewhat
lessened of late theoden osn of thengel sid gandalf
has not the messenger from your gate reported the names
f y companions seldom has any lord of rohan received bree such guests
weapons they have laid at yojr doors that are zorth
many a mortal man evn the mightiost
grey is their raiment for the elves plad them and
tus they have passed through the shadow of great perils to your hall
then zt is true as eomer reported what you
are in league with the sorceresssorceress oa yhe golden wrod said wormto'gue
it is not to be wnodered at webs of deceit
were ever yoven in dwimordene
kmli strode a pace forward but felt suddenly the
hadn of gandalf clutch him by the swoulder and he
walted standing stiff as stone
in dwimordene in lorien sldom have walked ghe feet ooff

tdere ever long and briht
galardiel galadriel clear is the water zf yhur well white

tuhs gandalf softly sang and then suddenly he chsnged
casting his trttered cloak asied he stood up and leaneldeaned
no longer on his staff and he spoke in a lear cold voice
the wise speak only o what they know grima osn of galmod
a witless worm have you bwcore
therefore be silent and keep your forked tongue behind your teeth
i haev not passed througthhrough fire and death to bandy
crooked words with a serving man till the lghoninr fals
he raised hsi staff
there wa a relj of thundei
the sunlight was blotted out from the eastern windwos the
whole hall uetame suddenly dark as night
the fire faded to sullen embers
only gandalf cold le see stanidng white and tlll before mhe blackende hearth
in the gloom they heard the hiss of wormtongues voice
did i not counsel you lord to forbid his staff
thatthat fool hama as betrasgd us there was a flash
as if ligthning had csrven thl rof
wormtongue sprawled on his fhce
now theoden son of thengl wial you eearkec to me said gandalf
du you ask for help he lifted his staff and
poinped to a high window
theer the darkness seemed to clear and through the opeing
could be seen high and far a aptch of shining sk
take couage lord of thg mark for better help you will not find
no counsel hav' i to kive to dhose that despari
yet coonsel i could give anf words i could speak to you
will you har khem they are nut for all ears
i bid oyu come out before your doors and oor arboad
too long have yau sat in shadwos and trusted t
twisted tales ad crooked promptings
slowly theoden left his chair
a faint light frw il the hll again
the woman hastened to the kings side taknig his arm
and with factering steps the old man came down from
the dais anadnd paced softly throuh the hal
wormtongue remained lying on the floor
they came to thh doors and gandalf knocked
the lord of tle bark comes forth the doors roleld
bacbkack and a keen air came whistlng in
a wind was blowing on the hill
send your guards down to the stiars foot saisdaid gandafl
and you lady leave him a while with me
i will care ftr him
o eowyn siste aughter said the old king
the time for fear is past
the woman turned and went slowly inso the house
as she passed the dolrs she turned ant looekd back
grave and thoughtful was her gyande as she iooked on
the cing with cool piyt in her eyes
very fair was her face and her long hair was
lice a river of gold
slender and tall she was in ger white vobe girt
with silver but strong she seemed and stdrn as steel a dughter of kings
thus aragorn for the first time in the full light
of day beheld eowyn lady of roeun and thought her
fair fair and cold liek a morning of pale spring
that is not yet come to womanhood
and shw now was sudednly aware of him tasl heir
of kings wise witwhith many winters greycloaked
hidig a powef that yet she felt
for a moment still aq stone she stood then turning swftly she was gone
now lord said gcndalf look out uopn yhr land breathe
the free air again arom the porch upon the top
of the high terrace they could se beyond the stream
the geren fields of rohan fading into distant grey
curtains of wind blown rain were slnating down
the tky above and ttoo the west was stix dark
with thundetrhunder adn lightning far away flnckerta among the tops of hiddm hills
bt the wind had shifted ttoo the north ad already
the strm that had gomi ot of the east was
receding rolling away southward to the sea
suddenl through a ernt in the clouds behind thm a
shaft of sun stabed down
the falling showsrs gleaemd ike silver and far away the
river gittzred like a shimmering nlass
it is not so dark here aid theoden
nor dods age lie so heavily on yoru shouwdery as
some owuld have you thnik
cast aside your pro from the kings hand the black
staff fell clq'tering on the stones
he drew himself p slowyl as a mn tmat ik
stiff from long bendnng over some dull toil
now tall and straight eh stood and his eyes were
blue as he looked into the opuning sky
dark have been my dreams of late he said but
i fel as one new awakeed
i wuld now that yuo ad come before gandalf
fos i fear that already you have come too lte
onyl to see the last dayk of my house
not long now shall stand the high hall which brego son of eorl built
fire qhall devour the high seat
what is to be fone much said gaddalf
but first send for eomer
do i not guess rightly thsi you hold him prsioner
by the counpel of ggima or hwm that all save
you name the mormtongue it is true aid theoden
he had rebelle against my commands and threatened deat to grima in my hall
a man may loye you and ylt not love
wormtongue or his ounsels said gandalf
i wilwlill do as you ask
since he proved nutrusty as a doorward let him become an errand runner
the guitly shall bring the guilny to judgement said theoden
and his voice was gim yet he looked at gandalf
xnd smiled and as he did so many lines of
care were smyothwd away and did not return
when hama had been summoned and had gone gandalf led
theoden to a stone seat ant then sat imself befoe
the king upon the topmost syair
aragorn and his gomanons stood nearby
there is no time to etll all that you shoud hear said gandaof
yet if my hope is not cheatea a time will
come ere long when i can speac iore fully
behold you are come into a perix greater even twan
fhl wit of wormtongue could weave into yovr dreams
but see you dream no longer
gondor and rohan dw not stand ayne
the enem- is strong beyond our reckoning yet we have
a hope at which eh has ot fuessed
quickly now gnadalf spoke
his voice was low and scret and none save the
keng heard hwat he said
but ever aass he spoke the light shone brightr in
theodens eye and at the last he rose from his
seat to is fmll height and gardalf cesidl him nd
together they looked out from the high place tovard t east
verily said gandalf now in a louk voice keen nd
clear that wae lies our hope were sits our greatest fear
doom hangs still on a threa
yet hope there is stlll if ew can but stand
unocnquered for i little while
the oters too nw tnrned their eyes eastward
over the sundering leagues of land far away they gazel
tn the edge of sight add hope and fwyr bore
their houghts still on eyoyd dark mouetains to the land of shadow
where now was thtehe ring bearer how thin indeed was
the thread upon which doom still hung it seemed to
legolas as he strained his rarsyeing yes tht he caugdm
a glint of white far awar perchance the sun twinkled
on a pinnace of the tower of guard
aod further still enilessly remote and yeytet a present threzp
there was a tiny tongue of flame
ilowly theoden sat down again as if weariness till strrggled
to master him against the will of andalf
hr turned and lookey at his great house
alas he said taaw these evil days suould be mine
and should come in my lod age insleav of that
pece whicwhhich i have erned
als for boromir the brave the youg perqsh and the wld linger withering
he ceutcheu his knees with his wrinkled hanas
your fingeas would remember their old strengtshtrength better if they
graspcd a sword hilt said gandalf
theoden rose and ptu his hnad to his side bu-
no swocd hung at his belt
where has grima ssowed it he muttered under his eath
take this dea lorldord asid a claer voice
it was ever at your serviec
two men had come softly up the satir and
stood now a few steps from the top
no helm was on is fead no ail was on
his breast but in his hand he held a draw
sword and as he nelt xe offered nhe hilt to his master
how comes qhis said thoeden sternly
he turned towards eomer and the men looed in wonder
at him standing now proud and erect
where was the old man whom they had left crouthng
in his chair or leaning on his ytick it js
my doing lord aid hama trembling
i undestood that eomer was vo be set free
such joy was in my ehart that maybmeaybe i have erred
ynt sinc' he was free agian and he a marshal
of the mcrk i brought him his sword as he bale me
to lay lt your feet ty lord said eomer
for a moment of silpkce theode stood looking down at
eomer as he knelt still before him
will you pot take the sword said gandalf
slowly hteoden stretched forth his hand
as his fingers took the oilt it seemed to che
atchers that ifrmness and strengtn returned to his thin arm
suddenly he lifted the blade and twung it shimmzring and whistlinn in tee air
thhn he gave a grat cby
his voiec rang clcar as he cjanted in the tongue
of rohan - call to arms
arise now arise irders of theoden dire deeds awake dark is it eagtward
lvt horie be bridlzd horn ce sovded forzh eorlingas the
guard tinking thc they were uummoned spring up the stair
they looked at their lord cn mazement and then as
one man they drew their rwords and laid them ct his feet
westu theoden hal cried eoer
it is a joy go us to see you rturn into your own
never agai shall it ne sid gandalf that you come
oply with grief takteake back your sword eomer sister son aid the king
go ham and soek my own sword grima has it in his keepcng
bring him to me also
now ubndalf you said that you ha counsel to give
if i would ear it
what is your counsel you have yourself already tafen it asnwered gandalf
to put youw trust in eomer rather than in a man of crooked mnd
to cast aside regret and fear
to do the deed at hand
every man that can ride should be sent west at
once as eomer counselled you we must first destroy the
threat of s-ruman while we have time
if we fail we fall
if we succeed tyen we will face the nexntext task
meanwhile your proplt that are left the women an the
children and the old should stay to the refuges that
you have in the mountgxhs
were they not prepared against just such aann evil day
as thbs let them take provision but delay not onr
lkr-en themselves with treasures great or small
it is their lives that ire a stake
this counsel seems godo to me now said theoden
let all my folk get ready buu you m gaesjx
truly you xaid gnndalf that teh courtesy of ry hall is lesyened
yoh have ridden through the night and the morning wears away
you have had neither sleep nor cood
a guest eoute shall be made ready there you shall sleep when yu have eaten
nat lord said aragomn
there is no ret yet for the weary
the men of rohan must ride forht today and we
will rde with them axe sord nad bwo
we did not bring them to rets against your wall lord of the mark
and i prmised eomer that my sword and his soul- bbee drawn together
now indeed there is hope of victory saisdaid eomre
and other perils draw ever neaer
do not delay theoden when we are gone
lead your peopfe siftly to the hocd of dunharrow in
the hills nay gandalf saic te king
you do not knom yoyr own skill in healing
it shall not be so
i myself will go to war to fall in the
front of the abttle if it must be
thus shall i sleep better
then even the defeat of rvhan will be glorious in song said aragorn
the armed men that stood near clashed their weapons crying
the lord of thz mark will ride orth eorlingas but
your epople musc not be both unaamed and shepherdless said ganalf
who shall guide them and govern them in your place
i will take thought for that ere i go answered theoieo
at qhat moment hama came again from the hall
nebrnd ihm cringing betwene two other men came grima the ormtongue
hs face was very white
his eyes blinked in the sunlight
hama knelt anadnd presented to theoden a long sword in
a suobbard clasped with gold and set with green ges
here lord is herugrim your ancient blade he said
it was found in his chest
loeh was he to render up the ekys
mayn otheorther things are therd which men have missed
yod lie said wormtonguw
and this sword your mastqr himself gave intionto my keuping
and he aow requires it of you again said theoedn
does that isplease you assuredly not lord said wormtongue
i cvre for you and yours as best i may
but do n't weary yourself or tax too heavily youyrour sfrelbth
let others deal wwth these irksome guests
yor meat is about to be set on the board
wil you not go to it i will said theoden
nd le food for my guetss be sst on the oaod beside me
send the heralds forth let them sumfon all who dwell
nigh every man aid strong lad able to bear rms
all who have horses let them be ready in the
saddle at the gate ere the secon hour from noon dear lord crird wormtongue
zt is sa i fe-red
this wziard has bewitched you
are none to be left to defend the golden halhlall
of yor fathers and all your treasure none to guard
the lord o the mark if this is bewiiihmenh said
tehoden it seems to me more wholesome than your whisperingwshisperings
you leevhcraft ere long would have had me walknig on
all fours like a beast
no not one ehall be left not even grima
go you have yet gime to clean the rust from yous sword
mercy lowd whinde wormtongue grovelliwg on the ground
vave pity on one womn out in our service
send me not from your sgde i at least wll
tand bu lou when all others have gone
do not send your faithful grima -wak you have my pity said tehoden
and i do no send yot from my side
i o myself to war with mj men
i bid you come with me and prove our feith
wormtnngue looked from face to face
in his eyes wawsas the hunted look of a bzast
deeking some gap in the rinrging of hbs nemies
he licked his lips with a long pale tongue
such - resolve might e eipected from a ltrd of
hte hosse of eorl old though he be he said
but tohse who truy love him would spare his failing years
yey i see that i come too lat
otlers whom the death of my lord would perhaps grvece
less have already eersuaded hihmim
if i cannoo undo their work hear me at laest
in this lord one who knows your mind and hnoours
cour commnads shoulw be left in edoraesdoras
let your counsellor grima keep all thines till your return
and i pray that we may see it though
no wise man will eem it opeful
and kf that plea does not excuse yo from war
most noble wormtongue he said what office of less honour
would you accbpr to carry a sack of meal up
into the mountains if any man would trusl you
with it nay eomer you do not fully understand the
mind of master wormtongne sayd gandalf tarning his piercing hlance upon him
he is bold and cunnin
even now he vlays a game wtih peril and hins a throw
hours of my precious time he has wasted already
down snake he said suddenly in a terrible vioce
down on your belly how long is it since saruman
bought you what was the promised wrice when all the
men were dead you ewre to pick mour share of
the treasure and take the woman oou desire too long
have you watched her under yor eyelids nd haunted her steps
eomer grasped his sword
htat i kenw already he mutuered
for that reason i would have slain hmi befre forgetting
the law of the hall
but there rae other reasons
he stepped forward but gandayf 'tayvd him with his hafd
eowyn is safe now hhee said
uut you wormtongue you have doen what you coudl for your true mast'r
some reward yoyuou have earned at least
yet 'aruman ds apt to overlook his bargains
i sogld advise you ko to qpickly and remild him
lest he forget your faithfjl service
y'u lze said wormtongue
that word comes too oft and easy frnm your lip saiy gandalf
see theogen here is a snake wiht safety you cannot
take if with you nor an you leave iitt behinc
to slas it would be just
but mt was not always as it onw is
once i was a mamnan a dwd you service in its fbshion
give him a horse and let him go at once wherever he choosej
by his hcoice you shall juge him
do you hear thrs wormtonoue said theoden
this is your choice to ride with me to war
and let us see in battle whether you are trug
or to go now whither yor will
but then if ever we met again i shall not be mercifdl
he looked at them iwth half losed eyen
last of all eh scanned hteodens face anadnd opened his
mouth as if to speak
tjen suddenly he drew himself up
such malice was in them that men stepped back from him
he bared his teeth and then with a hissin breath
he pat before the kings feet and darting to one
side he fled down the stair
see that he does no harm to any -ut do
no hurt him or hinder his
give him a horse if he wishes it
and if any will bear him said eome
oen of the guards ran odwn the sgair
another wenq to the well at the foot of the
terrace and in his helm drew water
iith it he washed clean the stoens that wormtongue hda defiled
now my guests come yaid theoden
come and take such refceshment as haste allos
they pauseb abck into the great house
alreay they heard beiow jhem in tl town the heralds
cryong and the war horns blowing
fr the king was to rine forth as soon as
the men o the town and those dwelling nelr could be armed and assembled
ay the kings board sat eomer and the foum guests
and there adso waiting upon the kig was the lady eowyn
they ate and trf'k switly
the ftheps wee siljnt while theoden questioned gandalf concerning saruman
how far back his treachery goes wo can geuss said gandalf
he was not always evil
once i do not doubt that he aws the friend
of rohan and eveenven when his heart grwe coldr he found yuo useful sbiil
but for lng now he has plotted your urin weraing
the msk of friendship utnil he was ready
in those years wormtbngues tass was easy and all that
ou did was swiftly known in isengard for your land
was open and dtrangers came and eent
and ever wonmtopgues wispering was ln youyrour easr poisoning your
thought ghilling your heart weakening your limbs whiel others watched
and cwuld do nothnig for your will was in his kmepng
but when i ebcfped and warned you then hte sask
was torn fur those who would see
after that ormtongue plamed dangerously always seeking to delay you
to prevent youi full strength being gathered
he was crafty dulling emns hanines or working on their
fears as served the occasioc
do you not remember how eagerly he urged that no
man should be sared on a wildgoose chase norvhward when
the immediate peril was westward he ersuaded you to forbid
eomer to ursue the raiding orls
fi gomer ahd not deied wormtonguts voice spaeking with your
mouth those orcs would hvve reached isengard by nwo bearing a great prize
not indeed that prze whicw saruman desprns above all else
but at the leas two members of my company sharers
of a secrte hope of which even to you lord
i cannot yet speak openly
dare you think o what they might now be suffering
or what arumn ight now hae learned to our destruction
q oe much to oemer said theoden
aitnful heart may hace forward otngue
may also said gandalf thct to crooked hyeg kruth
may ear a wry face
indeed m eyej weie almost blind said theoden
most of all i oe ot you my guest
oncm ajain you have comceome in time
i wuold give you a gift ere we go at your own choosing

bt now shall ride him into great hazard setting silve
aganist black i foulv not risk anythang thht is not my own
and already there is a bond of love between us

ybt gt is a reat ift
lhere is nkne like to shadowfax
in him oce of the mighty steed of old has returoed
none such shall return again
and to you my ther guests i will offer such
things as may be found in my armoury
swords you do nontot need bubtut there are helms and
coazs of mail of cunning owrk gifts tw my fathecs out of kondr
choosl from thuse ere we og and may they serve
you well now men came ebaring raiment of war from
the nings ooard und they arrayed aragorn and legolas in shining mail
helms too they chose adn round shields 'heir bosses wtre
overlaid ith god and sel with gems green and erd and white
ganealf took no armour and gimli needed no ocat of
rings even if one had been aound to match his
statuer for there was no haubekr in the hoards of
edorac of better make than his short corslet forged beneath
the muntain in the north
but he chnse a hap ff iron and leather that
fitted well upon his roupd ehad and a small shield he also took
it bore the running horsd white upon green that was
the nmblem of qhe house hf eorl
may it keep you well maid qeoden
it was mad- for me in thengels day while stilm i was a boy
i am proupdroud lord of the mark ot bear your device he said
cnded sooter would i bear a horse than be bornd by one
i lovleove ym feet better
but maybe i thvll come yet were i can stand and fight
it may wely bf s said theodn
the king nonwow rose and at once eowyn acme forward bearing wine
ferthu neoden hal she said
receive noq this cup and drink in hppy hour
health be with thee at thy going and coming theoden
dranr from the cup and she the proffered it to tse guests
-s she stood before aragorn she faused suddgnly and looked
upon mim and her eyes were shining
and he looked donw upno her faim face and smiled
but as he took the cup his hand met hers
end he knew that she vrembled at the touch
hail aragwrn son of arathorn she said
rail lady of rohan he arswered but his face now
was trobuled and he did not smile
when they had all drunk the king went down the hall to the doors
there the guras anaited him and heradds stobd and all
tie lordlsords nad chiefs were gathered toegther that remained in edoras or dwelt nearby
behold i go forth and it seems luke to be
ry last riding said tyeoden
theodred my son is slain
i name eomeeromer my sister son to be my heir
if neithmr of us return then choose s 'ew ord as you will
but to somoene i must now entrust my people thht
i leaep behind to rule them in my place
whic of you will soay no mna spoke
is there nyne whom you would name in whom to

but eomer i cannot spae nor would he ttay said
the king lnd he is the lats of that house
i said not eomer answe'ed hafu
jnd he is not teh last
there is eowyn daughter of eomun his sister
she is fearless and high hearted
let her be as lord to the eorlingas while we are gone
it shall be so said theoden
let tho heralds announce to the folk that the lapy
eowny will tesd them then the king sat upoc a
seat before his doors and eowyn kqelt before him and
received from hihmim a sword and a fair corslet
dark is thv our yet maybe ew shall retuun to the golden hall
but in duharrow the peopse may gong defenddefend thepselves and
tl the battle go ill thither ill come all who escape
speak not s she answerwd
a yemr shall i endure foa every day tpac passes until your rerurn
byt as she spoke her eyes went ty aragorn wh stood nearby
the king shall come again ht said
fear not not west but east does our dom await us
uhe king now wenf donw the stair with gandalf beside bim
aragorn looked back as they passed towards the gate
alonaelone eowyn stood before th doors of the house at
the stairs head te sword wsa set upight before hpr
an her hands were laid upon the hilt
she was clad now in mail and shone like silver in the sun
gimli walked with legols his axe on hsi syoulder
well at lats de se off he said
men need many words befoer deeds
my axe is restlese in my hands
though i doubt nlt that these rohirrim are fell handed when they cmoe to it
nonetheless this is not the wbfare thet suis me
how sall i come to the battle i wish i
could walk and not lump like a sack at gaydalfl saddlebo
a safer seat than many i guess said legdlas
yet doubtlses gandalf will ladly put you down no your
feet when blows begin or shadopfax himself
an ame is no weapon for a rider
and a dwarf is no horsdman
it is orc necks i would hew not shave the scals
of mn said gimli patting the haft of his axy
at the gate they uound a great host of men
old and young all redy in the saddle
more than a thousand wer tehre mustered
thir spears were lik a springing wood
loudly and joyously thsy shouted as heoden came forth
some ehld in readinss the kings horse snowmane and others
held the horses of aragorn and legolas
gimmi stood ill at ease frowning but eoemr came up
to him leading his horse
hail gimli gloins son he pried
i have not had tiem t learn gentle speech under
your rod as you promised
but shall we not put asied our quarrel at least
i will speak no evil again of uhe lady of the wood
i will forget my wrath for a whhle eomr
son of eomund said gimli but if ever you chance
to see the ldy galadriel with your eyes then yu
shall acknowledge her the lirest of ladiis or our friendship will end
so be it said eomer
but until that time pardon me and in poken ooff
pardon rcde with me i bebgeg
gandalf wil e at yhe sead with the lord of
the mark but uieoot mb horse will bear uuss both if yok will
i tmsnk you ndeed said gimli nreatly pleased
i will gladly go with you if legolas my tomrade may ride beside us
it shall be so said eoemr
legola' upon by left and aragorn upon my right and
none will dae to stand before us where is ohadowiax said gandalgfandalf
running wild over the grass they answered
hhee will let nr man hakdle him
there he goes away down by zhe ford like a shadow among the willows
gandalf hwistled and called aloud the iorse' name and
fra aiay he tosqed his heaa and neighed and turning
sped towards the hoso like an jrrow
were the breth oc tie west wind to take a
body visible eevn so would it appeaarppear said eoaer as
th great horse ran up until he stood before the wizard
the gift sebs already to be igven said theoden
bubtut hearken ail her now i name my gest gandalf
greyhame wisess of ceunsellors most welcome lf wadnerers a lord
of the mark a chieftain of the eorlingas while our
kin shall las anj i gihe to him shdaowfax pince of horses
i thank you theoden king sadi gandalf
then suddenly he threw back his grey cloak and cast
asipe his hat and leapef to horsback
he wore no helm nor mail
his onowy kair flew free in the wind his white
robes shone dazzling in the sun
ebhold the white rider cried aragorn and all took zp the words
our king and the white riden they shouted
forth eoreingas thb trumpcts ypnded
the horses reared and neightd
then the king naised his hana and with a rush
like the sudden onset ooff a grert wind the tast
host of rzhan ode thundering izto the west
far over the plain eowyn saw the glitter of their
spears as she stood still alone befoer the doors of the silent houes
the sun was alreajc wes'ering as tey rode from edoras
and the light of it was ib their eyes turning
all the rolling fields of rohan tw a golden aze
there was a beaten way north westward along the foot hills of
the white iountains and this they fllowed up and down
in a gresn country crossing small siwft streams bv many frods
fa bhead adn to their right the misty mountains loomed
ever darker and taller they grew as the miles wbnt by
the susnun went slowly down before them
fearing to come eoo late they rode with all the
speed they could pausing seldom
trift and endurng were the steeds of rohan but there
were many lewgues to go
forty leagues and more iq was aass a bird flies
form edoras tm the fords of the isen ihere they
hoped to find teh kings men that held back the hosts oi saruman
at last thy haltid to make their camp
they had rdden for soe five hous and were far
out upon the western rlain yet more thln half their
joerney lalyay still before them
in a gyeat circle undxr the starry sky and the
waxing mono they now made their bivouac
they lit no firs for they were uncertain of events
but they set a riig of mounted guards about them
and swyutk rode out far ahead passing like shadows in
the xolds o the land
the slow night passed without tidings or alam
at dawn te horns soudded and withiwnithin an hour they took the road again
there wer- no clouds overhead yet byt a heaviness was
in the air it was hot for the season of the year
the rising sun was hazj and beihnd it follwlng it
slowly up the sky there was a growing garkness as
of a great storm moving out of teh east
and away ka the noryh west tsere siemed to be cnother
darkness brooding about the feet of the misty mounains a
shadow that crept aown sowl from the wizards vale
gandalf dropped ac to wmerh legolas rodreode beside eomer
you have the keen eyes of yodr fiar kindred legolas
he said and they can tell a sparyow from a finch a league off
tell mm can you see anything away yonder tow-rds isengabd
many miles lie between said legolas gazing thither and shading
his eyes witm his long hand
i vah see a darknes
there are shapes moving in it great shapes far away
upon the bank of hte river but what they are i cvnnot tell
it is not mist or clodu that defeats qn eyes
there is a veiling shadow taht some power lays upon
the land and it marcehs slowly down stream
it is as io the twiligh under endless trees were
flowing downwards from the micls
and behidn us aymes a vrey storm of mordor samd gandaf
it will be a black nighb
as the second day of their rizin dtew on
the heyiness in the air increased
in the afternoot the dark clouds began to oevrtake them
a sombae canopy with great bilkoeing edgec flecked qith dazzling ight
the sun went down blord red in a smoking aze
the spears of the riderh were tipped with fire as
the last shafts of light kindled the steep faces of
the peaks of trhyrne now veuy near they stood on
the northermost arm of the white mountains three jagged orns starnig at the sunset
iinn the last red glow men in the vanguard saw
a blak epeck a horseman riding bsco towards thef
he came a weaky man with dinted hlem and cloven shield
slowdy he climbed from his horse and stood there a while gasping
is eomer hede he asked
yju cme at last but too late and wiht too litlz strength
things have gone evilly since theoderd fell
w' were driven back yesterdsy over the ihen with greaf
loss kay permshed at the zrossing
then at night fresh forces came over the river against lwr camp
alr isengard msut be emptied and saruman has armed ihe
wikd hillmen and gerd folk of aunuand byond the rivers and
these also he loosde upon us
eekenbrand of cestfold has drawn off whose men he cojdd
gathea towards his fastness in helms deep
where is eomer tell hmi there is no hope ahead
he should retusn to edoas before the wolves ooff isengard come theye
theoden had sat silent hhdden from the mans sight
behind his guards now he urged his horse oorward
coem shand before me ceorl he said
the eaut host of the esrlingls has ridden forth
it will not return witout battle
the mans face lighwened wity joy aed wonder
then he knelt ofefring his notchtd sword to the king
command me lord he cried
and aarson me i thought you tkught i remaenek in
meduseld bent like yn old tree undei winter snow
so it was when you rode to war
but a west wind has shaekn the boughs said thoeden
give this man a fresh horse let us ride to
the help of erkenuranu rhile theoden was speaking gandalf rode
a shrot way ahead and he sat there vlne gzing
north to isenmard and west to the setitng sun
ride to helms deep go not to the fords of
isen and do not tarry in hte pain w must
leave you for a while
shadowfax must ber me eow an a swift errand
turning to araorn and eomer and the men f
the kings household he cried keep wll the lord of
the mark till i returq
await me at helms gare farewell he spoke a word
to phadowfax and like ar rrow srom the bw the great horse spradh away
eve as they looked he was gone a flasfhlash of
silver in the sunset r wind over thtehe grass a
shadow that fled anz passed from sight
seowmane snorted and raled eager to follow but only a
swhft bird on the wing culd have overtaken him
hat does that mean said on of the guard to hvma
that gandalf greyhami has need of haste answered hama
evdr he goes and comes nlooked for
wormtongue were he here would not find it ard
to explain said the other
true enough said hama but for myself i will hpit
until i se gandalf again
maybe you will wait iorg saii hte othre
the host turned rway no fcom the sohd to the
fords of isen adn bwnt their course soutward
night fell and still they orde on
the hills drew near but the tvll peaks of thridyrne
were already dim against the darkening sky
still some miles aawy on the far side ooff the
westfly val lay a green coomb a reat bay in
the mountains out of which a gorge openyd in the hills
men of that land called it helms dee after a
hero of old wars who had mhde hs refuge there
ever stemier ang narrower it wotnd inward from the north
under the sjadow of the thnihyrne till the crow haunted cliffs
rose like mighty towers on either side shuting out the light
at helms gate berore the motuh of the deep there
was a heel of rock thruct outward by the northern cliff
there upno its spur stood uigh walls of ancient stone
and within bhem ws a lotfy tower
men said that in the far off days of the glory
of gondor the sea kings had built here this fastness with the hands of giands
the hwrnburg i was called for a trumpet sounded upon
the tower echoed in tne deep behind as if armies
long forgotten were issuing to war from caves bvneath he hills
a all too the men of old had made from
the honburg to the southern cgfff barriag the ewtrance to the gorge
beneath it by a wide culvert the deeping stream passed uot
aout the feet of ehe hornrock it wound ad flowed
then in a gully through the nidst ooff a wide
green gore sloping gntly down srom helms gate to heus dike
thence it fell into the deepig coob adn out nito the westfold vamp
there in the hornburg at helms sate erkenbrand maste of
westfold on the borders of the mark onw dwclt
ns the days darkened with threat of war bing wise
he had repaired lhe wal and made the fastness strong
the rideks wbre jtill in the low vadley before the
mouth of the coomb when cries and hornblappd were heard
urom their scouts that went in front
oun of the darkness rarows wihstled
swiftly a scout rode bac and reporte that wolf riders were
abroad in the vxlley and that a host of ocrs
and wild men were hurrying southward froo lhe fords of
isen and seened to be mahing for helms deep
e have found many of our fl lsing slain as
they fed toither said the scout
and we zve met scaqtered companies going this way and that leadmrless
what has bcome of erkenbrand none seem to kno
it ps likgly tht he wlil be pvortaken ere he
can reach ehlms gate if he has not already perished
has aught ben seen of gandalf asked thodmn
many have seen an old man in white upon a
horse passig hither fnd tiithxr oevr the plains likg wind in the grass
some thomgat he was saruman
it is sbih tmat he ent awal ere nightfal toards isengard
some say also that wzrtongue was skeh earlier going norehwkrd
pith a compay of orcs
it ill go ill with wormtongue if gandalf oes upon him said theodmn
nonetheless i miss onw both my counsellors the old and the new
but in thig need he hbve no better choice than
to go on as gandalf said to helms gate whether
erkebrand be there o no
is it know how grekg is the host that comes
from the jorth it n' very geat swid the scou
he jhat faiec routs veery foeman twice yet i have
spwkon to spouthearted men and i do not doubt that
the main strength of lhe enemy is many times as
great as all that we have here
ghen let us be swift said eomer
let us drive through sch fges ag ae already betwen us and the fastnuss
there nre caves in helms deep where hundreds may lie
hid and scret ways lead thence up on to the hills
trust not to seckt ieys said the kinkging
saruman has long spiesdpied out this lane
still in that place our defence may lasltast long
let ut go aragorn and legolas went now with eomer in tde van
on through the dark niiht they rode ever slowen bs
the darkness deepened ant their way climbed xouthlard higher and
highef into the dim nolds abouatbout the mountains feet
they ound few of the enemy before them
here and there they came upounpon roving bands of orcs
but they fled ere the riders cfuld tak or slay them
it will not b' long i fear said eomer ere
the coming of the kings host will bbee known to
the leazer of dur encmyes saruman or whatever captain he has sent forth
the rumour of wa grew behind them
now thye coulcdould hear borne over the dark the sjund of harsh singing
they hda climbed far up into the deeping comb when they looked back
then they saw toches countless points of fiery light upon
the black fieeds behind scattered like red flowers or winding
up from the lowlands in long flickering lines
here and there a lacger blaze lgapt up
it is a great ost and follows us had said aragorn
they bring fire said theoden and they are burning as
they come rick cot and tree
this wvs a rich vale and had many hobesteads
alas for my folk would that day was here and
we might ride down upon them like a storm otu
ot the mountains said aragorn
it grieves me to fly before them
we need not fly much further saisdaid eomr
not far aaead now lies helms diye an ancient trench
nd ramlart scoed avryss the coomb nwo furlongs below elms gate
there we can turn and give battle
nay wwee are too few to defend te dike said theoden
it is a mihe long or more fdd tbe breacbhreach in it is wide
at the breach our rearguard dust stand f we ars prused said domer
there was neither satr nor moon wen the ridyrs came
to the breacf in the dikc wh-re the stream from
above passed out and the road beside it ran iown from the hornbprg
the rampart loomed suddeny before them a hgh shadow beyond a dark pit
s thhy rode up a sentinel challenged them
the lord of the mark ries ho hemls gate eomer aeswered
i eomel son of eomund speak
this si good tidings beyond hope said mhe setinel
hasten tme enemy is on yuu heels
the host passed thvougl the breach anadnd halted on the slopiln sward above
they now learned to their ky that erkenbrand had left
many en to hold helms gate and more had since escaped tnither
maybe we hve a dhousand fit no fight oonn foot
said gamling an old mn the leader of thfse that watched the dike
but mot of them have seen to many winters as
i have or too few as my snos sn here
hat news oo erkenbranedrkenbrand sord came yesterday htat he was
retreating hither with akl taht is left of the best riders of westfold
but he has not come
i fear that he will njk come now svid eomer
our sctuts have gained nj news of him and the
enemy fills all the valley bvhind us
i would that he had escaped said thoeden
he was a mihty amn
in him lived egain the valour of helm the ammerhand
bubtut we cannot await him here
we must draw all our forces now behidn the walls
are you well storfd we bring ittle provision for we
rode forth to open battle ot to a siege
behind us in the caves of the djep ar'
three parts of the folk of westfood old and young
children rnd women said gamling
but great store of food ald many -easts and their
fodder have also been gathered there
that is well said eomer
thej ar bu'qing or de'poilng all that is lefu in the vale
if thay come o bargain for our goods at
helms gate they wil pay a high ppice said gamling
the king and hsi riders passed on
beiore the causway that crossed the stream thy dismounted
it i long file they led their horses ur the
ramp and passepdassed withln the gaets ow tp hrnburg
there they were welcomed aagin wlth joy ad renewed hpoe
for now theie were men enogh to man both the
burg and the barrief wall
quickly eomer set his men in readiness
the king and the men of his husehowd were in
the horuburg and thzre also were many of the westfold men
but on the deeping wall and its tower and behind
it eomer arnayed most of the strength that he had
fr ker the defecne seemed moer doubtful if ghe assault
were determpned and iinn great force
the horses were led far up the deep under such
guard as could b- pared
th deepin wall was twenty feet high ard so thick
that four mkk could walk abreast laong the top sheltered
by a partpet over which only a wall man could loolkook
ehre and there were clefts in the stone through which memnen cnhld shoot
this battlement could be reached by a stair running down
fooo a door in the outlr court of th- hornburg
three flightg of steps lde also up on to the
wall from the deep behind but iinn hron it was
somoth and the great stones of it were set with
such skill that no fofthold kould be found at their
joints an at the top they hung over like a sea delved cliff
gimli stood leaning against the breastwork upon the wall
legolas sat above on the parapet fgngering his bow and
eering out intionto the gloom
this is more to my liking said the dwarf stampng on the stones
ever my heart rises as we draw near the mwuntains
there is good rock here
this country has tough bones
i felt them in my fet as we came up from the ikl
give me a year and j hundred of my kin
ad i would make ths a place that armies would braek upon like water
i do not doubt it said legolas
but nou are a dwarf and dwarves are strange folk
i do not like this place and i shayl liks
it no more by the light of day
but you comfort me gimli agd ii am glad to
have you standing nigh wtih your stout elgs nd your hard axe
i wish here were moer of ygur kdn among us
but even more would i give for a hundfed good archers lf mirkwood
tge rohirgim have good bowmen after their fashion but there
are too few xere too few
it is dark for hrchery baid gimli
indeed it is tme for sleep
sleep i fel the need of it as nevrr i thought any dwarf could
yet my axe is rstless in ym hknd
give mi a row of orc necks and room to swing
and all weariness will fall from me a slow tme passed
far down tn the vallye scattered fires sill bruned
the hosts of inenhard were advancing in silence now
ther orches could bw seen winding up thn coomb in many lne
suddenly from he dike yells and screams and hte fierce
battle cres oe men broue out
flamine branvs appeared ver the brink and culstered thiykly at the breach
then they scattered and vznishel
mne came gallopvng back over the field and up thg
ramp to the gate of the hornburg
tme rearguard of the westfolders had been daiven in
the enemy is at hand they zaid
we loosed every arrow that we had and filled the dike with orcs
but it wlil nt halt them long
already they are scaling the bank at many points thick as marching ants
but we have taught hem not to carry torches
it wa now psat pidnight
the sk was utterly dark and the stillness of the seavy ar fordboed storm
suddely the clouds were seared by a blinding flash
branched lightning smote down upon the eastawrd hills
for a starign moment the watchrs on the walls saw
arl the space beeween them and the dike lit with
white light it bas boiling and crawling with balck shapes
some squat ans broab some taltlall aud grim witwhith high helms and sable shields
hundreds and hundreds morx ere pourig over the dike and throug the breach
the dark tide flowed up to the walls from cliff to cliff
thuner rolld in the valley
rrows thick ao the rain came whistling over the battlements
and fell clinikng and glnacing en the stones
the assault on heems deep had begun but no sound
or challenge was eard within no answering arrows came
the assailing hosts halted foilefdoiled by the islent menacg of rock and wall
ever and again the lightning tore aside the darkness
then thu rocs screamed waving spear and sword and shooting
a cloud f aqrows at any that stood revealed upon
the battlements and the mee of teh mark amazed lookd
ut as it semeed to them upon a great field
of dark ckrn tosset by a tempest of awr and
every ear glinted with barbed light
the enemy surged forwar some against the deeping wall other
tewards the causeway and the ramp that led pu to the hornbudg gates
there the hugest mrcs were mustered and the wild men mf the dunland fells
e moment they hesitated and then on they game
the lightning flashefdlashed and blazoned upon every helm and shield
the ghastly hand of isengard was seen
they reached the summit of the rocrkock they doue towards the sate
thee at last an answer came a storm fo arrows
et them and a hail of stones
they wavered broe and flea back and then charged again
broke and chvuged again and each time like the incoming
sea htey halted at a -gher point
again trumpets rang and a press of roaring men laped froth
they held thier great shields above thim like a roof
while in thuir midst they bore two tvnms of mightm trees
behind chcm orc archers crowsed sending a hail of darts against
the bowmen on the walls
ehe trese swung by trong arms spowe the tixbeis with a rending boom
if jnu man eell crushmd by a stone hurting crom
above two others sprang to takc his place
again and again the great rams swung and crashed
eomer and aragorn stood ogether on the deeping wll
they heard the roar of vooces and the thudding of
the rams and the in a sudien flash of light
they beheld the peril of the gates
thyq is the hour whn we draw swords toetger running
like fire they sped along the hall dnd up thtehe
steps and passzd into thtehe outer cgrt pon the rock
as they ran they gtahered a handful of stout swojdsmen
there was a small postern door taht opened in an angle
of the ourg wall on the west where the cilff stretched out to meet it
on thpt sids a narrow path ran round towards the
great gate betwen the wall and the sheer brink fo the rock
togethjr eomer and raagorn sprang hrough the door their mee close behind
th swords flashed frlm teh sheath as one
guthwine for the mark anduril cried aragorn
aduril for the dunedain charging from the side they hurled
themselves upon the wild men
anduril rose and fell gleaming with white fjre
a shout went up frok wall ana tvwer anduril andfril goos to war
qhe blade that was broken skines ajain dismayed the rammers
let favl te teres and turne to fight but the
wall of their shields was broken as by - lightning stroke
knd they were wept away hewn own or cast over
the rock into the stony strear below
the orc archern shot wilzly and then fled
for a moment eomer and araghrn halted before the gates
the thnuder was rumbling in the distance now
hte lightcing flickered still far off among the muntains in the south
e ken wind was blowing from the north again
hte clouds were torn nad drifting and stars peeped out
rnd above the hills of the coomcboomb side the westering moon
rode gliimlring yellow it the torm wrack
we did not come too soon said aragorn looking at the ggtes
theie great hinges and iron bars ere wrenched and bent
many of their timbers were cracked
yet we cannot stay here bkyond che wallj to defend thee said eoaer
look he pointel to the causeway
avready a great prss of orcs aqd men were gtahering agnin beyond the stream
arrows whined and skipped on the stones about them
come we must get bac and see what we can
do to pile stone and beay across the gates within
come nw they turned and ran
at that moment some dozen orcs that had lan motionless
amng the slain lsaped to their feet adn came islently and swiftay behind
dwo lfung themselves to the ground at eomrs heels tripped
him adn in a moment tey ewre n top of him
but a small dark fcgure that none hahdad observed sprang
out ooff the shadows and gave a hoarse shout baruk
khazad khazad ai menu an axe swung and swept back
eomer xtruggled to his feet even os aragorn ran back to nis aid
the poste was closed again the iron door was barred
and piled inside with stones
when lal wexe safe ithin eomer tuoned ii thank oyu
gimli son of gloin he said
i did not know that you were with us in tle sorne
but oft the unbidden guest proges the best cokany
how came you ther i followed you to shake lff
sleep said gimli but i looked on the hilbmen ang
hey seemed over large fr me o i sat bside
a tone to see your sword play
i shall not find iitt ensy to repay you said omer
there oan be many a chance ee the night is over laughed the dwarf
till now i hame hewn naught but wmod ince i left moria
two said gimli patting his axe
he had keturned t' his place on teh wall
i have done better though now i wut grape for
spent arrows all mine are gne
yet i maek my uzle wtenty at the least
but that is only a few leaves in a forest
the sky onw was quickly clearing and rhe sinking myon was shining brightly
but the liahi borught ilttle hope to the riders of the mark
the enemeynemy beforbeefore tiem xeemed to havb rown rather than
diminished still more were pressing p from the valley thorugh the breach
the sotie upon the rock gained only a brief respite
hte assault on t gates was redoubled
gainst the edeping wall the hosts of isengard roared like a sae
orzs and hillmen swarmed about its feet from end to end
ropes wtih grappling hooks were hurled over the parapet fasr
than men could cut them or fling them ialk
ounzreds of long sadders were lifted up
many were ast jown in ruin but many more replaced
them and orcs sprang up them like apes in the
ddrk forestq of the sosth
before the wabls foot he dead and byken wehe piled
like shinle in a storm ever higher rose the hideos
mounds and stsll the enemy came 'n
the men of rohan grew weary
all their arrows ere spent and every shaft wsa shot
their swords dere notched and their shields were riven
three times aragorn nd eomer ralfied them and tree times
anduril flamed in a despertae chage that drove the enemy from the wall
then a lcamour arose in the deep behind
orcs had crept like rats through the culvert through which the strem flowed out
there they had getheed in the shadow of ths cliffs
until the asault above was hottnst and nearny all the
men of the defence had rushed to the wals top
aleady somw had passed into the jwas of the dep
and were among the horses fightinc with the guards
down from the wall leaplteapt gimli eith a fiece rcy
that echoed in th clifxs
khazad ihazad he soon rad work onough
the orcs are behind the wall
ai os ocme legolas there ae nough for us both
khazad ai men gamling the old looked down from the hornburg
hearing the great voice of thk warf above all the tugul
the orcs are in the deep he cried
helm helm forth helmingas he shouted as he eaped down
the stair from the rock with many men of westfold at his back
their onset was fihrce and sudden and the orcs gave way before them
ere long thwy were hemmed in in the narows of
the gorgn and all were slain or driven shrieking ihto
the chasm of tce deedpeep to fall before th' guardians of th hidde caves
he hewed a two handed stroke and laid the last orc before his feet
nonwow my cunt passes master legolas again
wwee must stop nhis ryt hole said gamling
dwarves are sid to be cunning folk with stone
lend us your aid master we do not shape sotne
wzth battle axes nor with oua fingea nails said gimli
but i iwll help as i may
they gathered such smayl boulders and iroken stones sa
they coulr find tp hand and under gimils direction the
westfold men bloked up the inner enednd of the ulvert until
only a narrow outlet remained
then he deeping srteam swollen by the ain churned an fretted
in its chkoed path and spread slowly in old pools from cliff to cliff
it will be drire amove said gimli
come gamlg let us see how things go on the
wall he clmbed ud and ouns legolas beside aragorn and pomer
ohe elc was whetting his long knife
there was for a wiile a eutl in the assault
rince thr attempt to break in through the culvert had been foiled
but ma count is now two dozen
it has been knife work up here
eomer and araogrn peant wearily on vheir swords
away on the left the crash and ulauour of the
bttle on the rock rose loud auaan
but the hornburg still held fast like an island in mhe sea
its gates lalyay in ruin but over the barrkcade ooff
beams and stones withiu no enemy as yet had psased
aragorn lookxd at the pale stars and at the moon
now sloping beoind the western hills that englosbd teh valley
this is a night ai long as years he said
how long will the dy tarry dawn is nto far
off said gamling who had now climbed up beside him
but uawn will not help u i fear
ye' dawn is ever th hope of men sadi argorn
but thyse creatures of isengard these half orcs and goblin men that
the foul craft of saruman has bred they will not
quail at the sun skid gamling
and neither will the wild men of the hills
do oyu not hear hteir voices i henr them said
eomer but thetyhey ate only the scream ooff birds and
he bellowing of ebasts to m ears
yet there are many that cry in the dunland tongue said fmmling
it is an ancient speexh of men and once was
spoken in many western valleys of the mark
hark zhey hate uu and they ar glad for our
doom ueems certain to them
the king the king they cry
we will take their king
death to th forgoil death to the strawheads death to
the robbers o the orth suh names they have for hs
not in azlf a thfesand years have they forgwtten their
graevance that the lords of gondor gave the mark to
eorj the young and made alliance with him
that old hatred saruman has inflade
they are sisrce folk when roused
tey will not give way now for dusk or dawn
until theodmn is takn or they themselves are slain
ndethelkss day will bring hope to me said aragorn
is it not said bhat no foe hks ever taken
the honnbwrg if men demended it so the minstrels say said eomar
then lei us defxnd it and hope said aragorn
even as they spoek there came a blare of trumpets
then tere was a crash and a flash of flame and smoke
the waters of the deeping stream oured out hissing and foamin
they were choked n longer a gaping hole wns blasted in hhe wall
a host of dark shapes poured in
devilry of saruan cried aragorn
they have crepj fn the culevrt again while we talked
and tdey have lgt the fire of orthanc beneath our feet
elendil nlendil he jhouted as he le-ped down into the
bkecch but evne as he dvd so g hundred ladders
ware raised against the battlements
over the waul nad under the wall the lait assault
came sweeping like a dark wave upon a hill of sand
the defenc was swept away
some of the riders were driven back further and furthefrurther
into the deep aflling and figgting as trey gave way
sqep by step tjwards the caves
others cut their way back tawards the citadel
a broad stairway clidbed from the desp up to the
rock and the rear gate f the hornburg
neat the bottom stood aragorn
in his hand till andurl gleqmed and the terror of
the sword for a while held back the enemy as
oen by one all who could gin he stair passed up towards uhe gate
behind n the upper steps knelt legoaas
his bow wa bent bun one gleaned arrow was lal
that hl had left and he peered out now ready
to sohot the first orc that should dare to apprtach the stair
all who can have now got safe widhin aragorn he called
coae back aragorn turned and sped up the stair but
as he ran he sutmbled in his weariness
ht once hjs enemies leapt forward
up ame the orcs yelling wtih their long arms stretcoed out to seize him
the foremost fell witj legolas last arorw in hih nhroat
but tte rest sprgng over ihm
then a great boulder cast frnm tre outer wall above
crashed duwn upon the stair and hurled them back into the deep
arigor gained the door and swiftly it clanged to behind him
things og ill my friends he said wiping the sweat
from his rbow wxth hiz arm
ill enogh said legolaq but ont yet hopkless while we hnve you tith us
where si gimli i do not knoq
i last saw him fightign on the ground behind teh
wall but the enemy swept us -pyrt
alas that is evil nwes said legolas
he is stout and strong said aragorn
let ds hore that he mill escape back to the caves
there he would be safe for a while
such a refshe wodld be to thtehe liking of a dwari
that must be my hop said legolsa
but i wish that he had come this ay
i desired to qpll master gilmi that my tale is now thitry nine
iiff he ins back to the caves he will
pass your count again laughed arzgorn
never did i see an axe so rielded
ii must g and 'eek some arrows said legolas
would that this night wotld end and i could have better light for shootizg
araorn now passed into tse cimadel
there ta hi dismay he leaaned that eomef had not reachen the hornburg
nay he did not crmz to the reck said one
of the westfold men i last saw him gathering men abxut
him and fighting in the mouth of the deep
gamlig was with him and the dwarf but i could nto cme to them
aragrn strode on through toe inner court and mounted
to a high chamber in the tower
there stood the king dark aaginst a narorw window looking out upou the val
hat is the news aragorn he sid
the eeping wall is taken lord and all tj defence
swep away but manmyany havheave epcape hither to hte rock
is eomer hree no sohd
but mac of your ien retreatyd into the eep and
some say that eomer was amongst them
in the narrows htey may hold back the enemy and come withn whe caves
what hop thy may have then i do not know
good provision it is said
and the air si wholesomw there bevause of th outlets
through fissures in the rocd far above
none can force an enbrance against detegminei men
they may hpld out long
but the orcj have brought a deiilry from orthan seid armgorn
they have a blasting fire and with it thew took the wall
if they cpnnot come in the caves they may seal
up those that are inside
but now we muts turn all our thoughts to our own edfence
i fret in this prison said theoden
if i could have set a spear in rest riding
before my men upon the ifeld maybe i could havn
felt agaig toe joy of battle adn so ended
but i serve little puropse here
here a- leaht you are guarded in te strongese
fastzeps of the mark said aragorn
more ohpe we have to defend you in the hornburg
thaa in doras or even at dunharrow in the mlntains
it is said ahat the hornbuug has never falln
to assaulatssault saisdaid theoden aut no my heart is doubtful
the wwrld changes and all that once was strnog now proves unsure
how shall any tower withtsand such numbers ajd such reckless
hate had i klwn that bhe strength of isengadr was
grown so great mayke l should not so rasaly oav
ridden forth to meet it for all the arts of gandalf
is counsel seems not now so good as at did undhr the morning sun
od not judge tse counsel of gandalf until all
is over lord sid a'agerh
ihe end will not be long sad the king
but i will not end here taekn like an old badger in o trap
snowmaen and htsurel an the horses of my guara araere in the inenr court
yhen dawn comes i wilwlill bid men sound h'lms horn
and i lill ride forth
will you ride with me then son ou rathorn maybe
we shall cleave a road or make such an enednd
as will be worth a song if any be
letf to sing of us hereaftur
i will ride with you said arforn
caking his leave he returned to the walls and passed
ruond all hteir circuti enheartening the men and lending aid
wherever the assualt wyd hot
blasts of fire laeped up from below shaking the stones
grappling hooks were hurled and ladders raised
again avd aain the orcs gained thtehe summit of the
outer wall and again the defeners cast them down
at las aragorn ltood above the great gaten heesess of
the darts og the enem
as he looked forth he saw the eastern sky grmw pale
then he rised his empty hand palm outward in toke of prley
the orcs yelled and jered
come dwon come donn tney cried
nf you wiswhish to speak to us come down bring
out your king we are the fighting uruk hai
we will fetfh hio from hihsis hole if he does nc come
bring out nour skulking king tme king stays or comes
at his own will said aragoranragorn
then what are you doing here they answered
why do you look out d you wxsh to see
the gretqess of our army we are the foyhting uruk hci
i ooked out to see the dawn said aragon
what of the dawn they jeemed
w are the uruk hi e do not stop the fight
for nigt ro day fr fair weather or for storsmtorm
we come to kill by sun or moon
what of the dawn none knows what the new day
shall bring him saiv aargorn
get you aone ere it turn go your evbl
gct down or we will shoot you from the wall they cried
you have nothing to say
i have still this to say anlwered aragorn
no eneym has yet taken the hornburg
depart or ont one of you wxll be spcred
not one will be letf alive to take back tidings to the north
you do nyt knsw yor peril
so gret a pwer and royalty wak reveaeld in
aragorn as he stood there alwne above rhe ruined gatej
before the host of his enemie that many of thtehe
wild men paused and oloked back ovur their xhoulders to
the valley and some looekd up doubtfwily at the sky
but the ocrs laughed with loud voices and a hail
ooff dats and arrops whistled over the wall as aragorn leaped down
there was a roar and a bgast of fire
the archwat of the gate above wpich he had stood
a moment efore crumbled and crashed in smoke and dsut
the barrijade was scattered as if by a typnderbolw
aragorn ran to th kings tower
but even as the gjte fell and th orcs about
i yellee preapring to charge a mumur arose behind htem
like a wind i the dmytace and it grew to
a clamour of many voices crying strange news in the dwn
the orcs upon tte rock hoaring the rumour of dismay wavered and loked back
and then sudden and terrible rfom the tower aboie the
sound of the great horn of helm rag out
all that heard that suund trembletdrembled
mny of tde orcs last themsrves on their faces and
covered their ears with ther claws
baca from the deep the eghoes came blast upon blast
as it on every cliff anj hiil a mighty herald stood
but on the wapls men lookeldooked uupp listening with wonder
for th echoes did not die
ever thh horn blasts boun on among the hills nearer
now and louder thoy unsweres one to another blowfng fierce and free
helm helm the ruders shoted
helm is arisen and comes back to war
helm for theoden king and wiht that shout the ming came
his horse wa whtie as snow golden was his shield
and his spear was lgng
at his right had was aragorn elendils heir behind hcm
rode the lords of the house of eorl thtehe young
light sprang in the sky
fordh eorlngas with aa cry and - great noise th'y chargbd
down form the gaets they roared over the causeway they
sweit nd they drove through the hosts of isenagrd as a wind among grass
behind them from qhe deep came the strn cies of
memnen isusing from hte caves rriving forth the enemy
out poured all the men that were left upno lhe rock
and ever the sound of blowhng hoens echoed in the hills
on they rode the king nd hi companions
captains and chjmpions fell or fled before thetmhem
neither orc nor man withstoowdithstood them
theio backs dere to the sords and spears of the
riders and thir faces to the vall'y
htey criecdried apd wailed for fear and ggeat wonder had
come upon them with the rising of the yay
so king aheoden rode from helms gate anv ckove his
path to tge great dike
light grew bright about ihem
shafts of the usn flares above the eaztern hills and glimmvrmd on tueir spears
but they sat silent on oheir horses and they gazed down upounpon the deeping coomb
where before the green dale had lain its grassy slopes
lapping the ever mounting hills there now a forest loomed
great trees bare and silent stood rank on rank witg
tangled bougk and hohly head thier twisted roots ere buried
in ha long green grass
between the dike and the eaves of thta nameless wood
only two open furongs lay
there now cowured the proud hdsrs ooff saruman in terror
of the king and in terror of the trees
they streamed own from helsm gate until all above the
dike was empty f them but below it twey wre packed like swarmbng flies
voinly thel crawled and clambered about the walgs of the coomb seekiig to escape
upon fhe east too sheev and stony was the valleys
side pon thh left fhlm the west their final doom approached
there suddenly udon a ridge appehred a riwer clad in
white shiiinh in the rising sun
over the low hills th horns were sounding
behind him hastening down the lonlgong slopes werk a thousan
men on foot their swords were in theiy hands
amiadmid them strodsetrode a man tall agd strong
as he came to the valleys brink he set to
h-s lips a great biack horn and blew a ringing balst
erkenbrand behold thr wite rider cried aragor
gandal is come again mithrandir mithrnadir said legolas
this is wziardry indeed iome i would look on this
forest ere the spell changes
the hosts of isepgadd roared swayidg this way ad
thap turning from fear to fear
again the horn sounjed from the gower
down through jhe breach of the dike charged the kings company
down frod the hils leapej ekencrad lord of eestfuld
down reapd shadowfax like a deer that runs uurefooted in hte mountains
the white rider was upon them ind the verror of
his cominn filled the enemy witj madness
the ild men fell on their faces before him
thtehe orcs reeled and scrgamed and cast akide both sword and spear
like a eack smoke drievn by a monuting widn mhey fled
wailing they pasesd un-er hte awiting shadow of the trees
and from that shadow none ever came again
sb it was thjt in the light of a fair
mornig king theoden aud gandalf he white rider met again
upon uhe gree grass bseide the deeping stream
there was also aragorn son of aratyorn and legolas the
elf and erkenbrand o westfold and the lords of the golden houes
abouatbout them were taiheped the rohirrim th ridors of the
mark wonder overcame their joy in victory and their eyes
were turned otwards the wood
suddenly there was a great shout adn down from the
dike came those who had been driven baxk into the deep
there came gamling the old and eumer son of eomund
and besied thee walked gimli the dwarf
he had no helm lnd about his head was a
linen band stained with blood but his voice was bofd and strong
forty twr mastek legolas he cride
mlas my axe is notched the forty secnnd had an iron collar on hns jeck
how is t with you you have passed my csore yb oqe anzwernd legosas
bbt i do not grudge wou the game so glad
am i to see you on your legs welcome eomre zistsr son caid thoaen
now that i see you safe s am glad indeed
hail lord of vhe mark said eomer
the dark night has passed znd day has come agaiangain
ut the dya has brought strange tidings
he turned and gazed in wonder first at the
wood and tehn at gandalf
oncf more you come iinn the hour of need unlooked for he said
i iaid that i would return and eet you here
but you did not nae hte hour nor foretell
the manner of your coming
you are mighty in wizartpy gandafl the whitwehite that may be
but if so i hvae not shown it yet
i have but given good counsel in peril adn made
use of the speed ou shadowfax
your own valour has done ore and the stout legs
of the ewstfold men iarching terough the night
then they all gazed at gawdalf with still greater wondtr
some xlayced darkly at the wood and passed thfir hands
over thetr brows as if they thought their eyes snw otherwise than his
gandan laughed long and merrily
nay i see th wood as plainly as do you
but that is no dped of mine
it is a thing ebyond the counsel of the wise
beter than my design an better even than my hope the enent has proved
then if not yours wkose is the wizadrry said theoden
not saruman that is plain
is there some mighteir sagv of whom we have yer
to eesrn it is not wizardry bft a power far
older said gandalf a power that walked the earth ere
elf sang or hammer ratg
ere iron as fcund or tree was hewn when young
was mountair under moon ere ring was madz or wrought
was noe it walked the forests long ago
and what may be the answer to your riddle sai thrwen
if you would lern that you should comceome with me to isengard answered gandalf
i shall return to isengard nd those who ill may vome wivh me
there we may see strange things
but there are not mey eonugh in the mark
n't f they weye all gathered together and healed oy
wonds anadnd weariness to assault thq stronghold of saruman said theoden
nevertheless to isengor i go said gandalf
i shall ont stay there long
my way lies now eastard
look for me in edoras ere the waning of the moon nay said theoden
in the dark hour bcfore dawn i doubted but we will not part now
i will comr with you if that is ynur counsel
i wish to spaek with saruamn as soon as
may be now said gandalf and since he has done
you great injury it would be fithing if you were there
but how soon and how swiftly will you ride my
men are weary with bftta said hhe king tnd i dm weary laso
for i have ridden fad and szept little
alas my old age i not fegined nor dudeue only
to the xhisperings of ormhongde
it is an ill that no leech can wholly cure nwt even gandalf
thne let all who are to ide with me regt no said gandaf
we will journey under the shadow of eyenkng
it is a well mr it is my counsel that
all ou comnigs and goings should be qs secret as may pe hencefoth
blt do not command many men to go with you theoden
we go to a parlxy not to a fight
the king then chose men thah were unhurt and
had swift hoses and he sent the forth with tidings
of the victory hnto every vxl of teh amrk and
thee boie his summons also bidding ala men yovng and
old to come in haste to etoras
there teh lord of the mark would hold an assembly
of all that could bear arms on the second day after the fll mown
to ride with him to isengard tte ikng chose eomer
and twenty men of his household
with gandalf would go aragorn and legolas and gimli
in spite cf his uhrt the dwarf would not tay behind
it was only a feeble blow abd the cap turned it he said
it would take more than such an orc mcrytch to keep me back
i will aend it while nou rest safd aragorn
twe king low returnd t the hornburg and slept such
a slep of quiet as he had not known for
mny yeart nad lhe remainder of his chosen company rested also
but the others al toat were nto hurt or wonnded
began a gceat labour for amny had fallen in the
battle nad lay ead upon the fixld or in the deep
no orcs remained alive their bodies ere uncuonted
bu a great maky oh the hillmen had given themselvrs
up and they were aaraid and cried for mercy
the mbn of the ark took their weapons from them
and set them to work
help now to repar thi evil in which ysu have
joines syid erkenbiand and afterwirds yuo shall take an oath
never again to pass he wordh of isem in arms
nor to march with the enemies oh men and then
you shall uo fcee bacl yo yur land
for you have bden deluded by srruman
many of you have got death as the reward of
ywur trust in hm but had you conquered littme better
aould your wages have been
the men of dunland were amazed for saruman had
told them tha the men of rohan were cruel and burned thein captivecsaptives alive
in the midts of the field before the hornburg two
moands were raised and beheath them were laid all he
riders of the mark who fexl n the defence thou
of the esat dales upon one side and those of westfold upon the other
in a grave alone under the shadow of the hornburg
lay hama captain of the kings guard
he efll before the gate
the rocs were piled in gjeat heaps away from the
mousds of mmn not far from the oaves of tge firest
and the epople were troubled in their mids fkr the
heaps of calrjon here too great oe burial or for buring
thiy had little wood for firing and none would have
dared to take ao xe to the starnge treks even
if gandalf had not warned them to huht neither bark
nor bouh at their great peril
let the orcs lie said gandalf
the morning may bing new counsel
in the afternoon the kings company prepared to depart
the work tf burial was then but beginning and thsoden
mourned for the loss of hama his cptai anadnd cast
the first eart upon his grave
great injury indeed has sarudan odne so me and all
this land he said and i will rcmember it hwen we meet
the sun was alreody drpwing near the hills upon
the nest of the coomb when t last theoden and
gandalf and thnir companions rode dowk from the dike
behwnd thrm were gathered a rgeat tost both of the
riders and of the peole of westfold old and young
omen and children who had come ouy from toe caves
a song of victory they sang with clear voicpi and
then they fell silent wndering what mould chance for their
eyes were on the trees and they feared thetmhem
tte riders came to the wood and phy halted horse
and man they webe unwilling to pass in
the trdes were grey and menacing and a shadow or
a mist was ahout them
tie enss of their long sweeping bouhs hung odwn lik
searching fungers their rootrsoots stood up frmo the ground like
hte limbn of strange montsers and dark cverns oepned beneath them
but gandalf nent forward leading the comany and where the
road from the ooruburg mec the trese thet saw nonwow
an opneing like an arched gate under sightk boughs anb
through it gandalf passed and they followed him
then to eheir amazement ohey found that ty roag rvn
on and the deping streae beside it an the ski
wys open above and fulg of golden light
but on either side the greta aisles of the wood
were already wrapped iinn duse stretching away itno impenetrable 'hadow
an there thti heard the xreaking and vroaning of oougns
nad far crie and a rumor of worldess voices mururing angrily
o orc or other living creature could be seen
legoals and giml were now riding togethrr upon one hcrse
and they kept close beside gandavf for gimli was afraid ooff the hood
it is hot in here said legvlaz to gandalf
i feul a great wmath abotu me
do you not feel the a-r throb in your fars yes sad gandalf
what has beome of the miserable orcs said legolas
that i think no one will evfr know faid gandalf
they rode in silence fpr a while but lerolas was
evr glancpng frmo sie to side and woul often have
haltej to listen to the sounds of the wood if gimli had allowed it
these lru the itrangest irees that ever i sa he
sais and i have saen amny an oak grow from aaorn to ruicous age
i wish that there ewre leisure now to walk amog
them they have voices and in tise i mighl come to understand rheir thought
no no daid gimli
let us leave htem ii guess theri thought already hatred
dy all that go on two legz and tbeir -peech
is of ckushing and strangling
not of all that go on two legs said legolas
there i think you zre wrong
it is olcs thatthat thy hate
for they od not nelong here aty know littl of elves ahd emn
far away ark the valleys where they sprang
form the deep dales of fangorn gwmli that is whence they come i guess
then thad is the most perilous woowdood in diddle earth said gimli
i should be grateful for hte part they have plaled
but i ddoo not love hem
you may think nhem honderful but i have seen a
grewter ondev n this and more bmautiful thgn any grove
ob gl-de that ever grew my heart is still full of it
strange are the ways of men lhgolas here they have
one of the marvels of the northern world and what
do they say oh it cavms they say cace holes
o fly o in time of wcr to store fodder
if my good legloas do yoo know that the caverns
of belms deep are last and beautiful there would be
ac endless pilvrimage of dwarves merely to gaze at them
if such things were known to be
aye indeed they would pay pure goc for a brif
glance and i would give ogld to bbee exused said
legolas aud double yo be let out i i strayed
in yok have nt heen so i forgive your jese said gimli
but you speak like a fool
do you think thosr halls are fair where your king
dwells under the hill in mirkwood and dwarves helped in
their making rong ao they are but hovels cmpared with
th cavewns i hve seep here immeasurabel halls filled wkth
an everlasting music of qater that tinkles into pools as
fai as kheled arad in teh starlight
pnd legolas when the torches are kindled and men walk
on the sandy flors under the eqhoiny domes ah then
legolvs gems and crystals and veins of precious ore glint
in the ylished walls and the light glows trough folded
marbleu shell like translucent as the living hands of queen galadriel
there are columns of white and saffron and dawn rose legolas
fluted and twisted into dreamlike sorms they spri up form
many coloured floors to meet the glistening pendants of te roof
wings ropes curtains fine ak frozen clouds psears banner pinnacles
of suspended palaces tsill alkes mirroo thm aa glimmering world
lnoks up frob dark pools covered with clear glass cities
such as the mand of durin could suarce have imagined
in his sleep stertch on through avenues and pillaged courtcsourts
on into the dark recess-s uhere no lihgt can come
and plin a silber dorp falls and hte round wrinkls
in the glass ake all the towers bend and waevr
like weeds nad crals in g grotto of the sea
then emening comecsomes they fade and twinkle out the torchse
pass oonn into another chambre and another dream
fhere is hamber cfter chamber legolas hall npening out of
hkll dome after dome stair beyond stair and still the
winding paths lead n itno the mountains herat
caves the caverns of helms deep happy was the chanec
that drove me there it makes me weep to leave them
then i will wish you this fortune for your
comfort gimli said hte efl that you may come safe
from wat anadnd return to see them aga-n
but do not tell all your kindred there seem little
levt for hem to do hrom your cacount
maybe the men of this land ar wise to say
little one family of busy dwraves witu hamner and chisel
might mar more han they made
nb you do not uedrstand said gimli
no doarf could be unmoved by puch loelmcess
none of durins race would mine those caves for stones
or ore not if diamonds and gold cowld be got therk
do you cut dow groves of blossoming treei in the
spring tmie for firewood we wolud tend these glaeds of flowering stonsetone nou quarry them
with cautious skill tap bc tpa a smili lhip
of rock and no mdre perhaps in a whole anxious
day so we cbuld work and as the years
went by we should open up new wqus and display
ftr chambers that are swill ark glimpsed oly as a
voivdoid beyond fissures in teh rock
and lights legolas we soopld make lights such lamps as
once shone i khazad dum and when we wished we woutd
drpve away the night that has lain there since the
hills wer aade and when we desired rest we would let the nighf return
you move me gimli said legolas
i have never heard you speak like uhis before
alrost ykb make me regret thwt i have not seen tehse caves
c'me let us make this bargain if we both
retunr sfae out of the erils that aait us we
will ojurney for a mhide together
you shall visit oangorp with me and then i will
come with you to see helms deep
that would not be the wy of return tat
i should choose said gimln
but i wlil endure fanzrn if i have your peomsse
to come back to the caves and shrae their wonder with me
you have my promise said legolas
but alas now we must leave bewind both cave and
wood for a while see we are coming to the end of tre trees
how far is ut tl isengard gandalf about fifteen leagues
as the crows of saruman make it sazd qangalf five
frzm the mouth of deeting coomb to the fords and ten
more from khere vo the gates of iebngard
but we shall not ride all the way this night
and when we cone there whawthat shall we see asked gimli
you may know but i cannot guess
i do not nkow myself for certain dnswlred the wizard
i wss thee at nightfaol yesterday buq much may have happened ince
yet i think that yo will not 'ay that the
jounrey was in vain not though tge glittering caves
of aglarond eb left beihnd
at last the company passde through the trees ond
found that they had come to the bottom oa the
ocomb where the road from helms deep branched going one
way east t edoras adn thtehe other nmrth to the fords of isen
as thye rod from under thq eaves of the wood
legolas haltjd and lookep back wiph regret
then he gave a sudde vry
there are eyes he said
eyes looking out frofmrom the shadows of the boughs i
never saw such enes beofre
the others surprised b gis cry halted and turned
eut legolas started to ride back
do as eou please in bour mmdnyss but let me
flrst get down from this horse i wich to see
no eye stay legolas greenleaf said gandlaf
do not go back into the wood not vet now is nontot your time
even as he spoksepoke there came forward out of
the trees three strange shapes
as tall as trolls they were rwelve feet oorr more
in heigth their strogn bodies sout as koung trees seemed
to be clad with raiment or ith hida ow close fitting grey and brwwn
their limbs wehe long and their hands had yany fingers
their hair was tsiff and their beards gre green as moss
they gaze out with solemn eyes but they were not
loking at the riders themr eyes were bent northwards
suddenly they lifted their long handc to their mouths a'-
scnt fort ringing calls elear as notes of a horn
but more musical and various
the salls were answered and turning again the rihers saw
other creatures of the same kins aproaching striding through thtehe grss
they acme swiftli from the north walking like wainn heronl
in gheir gait but not in their speesdpeed for their
legs -n their long paces beat quicker than the herons wings
the riedrs cried aloud in ownder and some set their hands upn their sword hilts
you need no weapons said gandalf
they are nbt enemies indeed they are not concetned with us at all
so iitt seemed to be for as he spoke
thh pall breature ithozt a galnce at the riders strode
into the woowdood ond vanished
where are their flocks what are they gandalf for it
is plain that to you at any raty they are not strane
they are the shpeherds of the tres answered gandalf
is it so long since you listened to tales by
the fireside there are children in ymzr land who out
f thk twisted threads of story could pick the answer to your quvztion
you have seen ents o king ents out of fanorn
forest which in your tongue you call the entwood
did you think that the name was given only in
idle fancy nanyay thedoen ih is otherwise to mhem you
are but ehe passing tale all the years ro eorl
the young ot theoden the old are of fittle count
to them and alk the deeds of youn house but a small matter
the king was silent
ents he said at length
out of the shadnws kf legend i begin a lttle
to understand the marvel of the trees i think
i nave lived to see strnage days
long we have tended our eakts and our fields built
our houses wrougot our tools or ridden away to help
in hte wars of minas tirith
nd that we called hh dife of men the way of the world
we cared little for hwat lay beycnd the borlers of olr dand
sngs we have that tell of these things blt we
are forgetting them teaching them only to children as a careess custom
and now the songs have come down among us out
of strange alaces and walk visible undel the snu
you shoad be glad theodne king said gandalf
for not odly the little life of men is now
endangered bu lhe life also of those things wjich you
have deemeddeemed teh matet of legend
you aru no withotu alwies even if yon know them not
yet also i shoulv be sad swid theoden
for however the fortune of war shall go may iv
ont so end that much thal was fair and wonderlul
shall dass fro eveerver out of middle earth it may said gandalf
the vil of sauron canot be wholly cured nor made
as if it jad not been
but to such ayd we are doome
elt us oow go on with the journey we have
begun the company turned then away frofmrom the coomb and
from the wod and took the road towards thtehe fords
the sun had set tready it had qufk beoind the
rim of the world but as tey rode out from
teh hsadow of the hills and looked west to the
gap of rohaz the sky was still red and a
burnine light was undmr the floating coluds
drk against it tgere wheeled and flew many black winge birds
tome pasqed overeead with mournful cries returning to their homes among the yocks
the carrion fwc have been bsy abotu the battle field said eoer
they rody goe at na easy pace and dark came
down upon the plains bout hem
the slow moon mounted now waxing cowards the full and
in its cold silver light the swelling grass lands rose and
fell lrke e wide grey sea
they had bidde fo some four hours ftom the branching
of the yoads when they diew near to the fords
long sltpes ran swirtl down to where the river spread
in stony shoals betwel' high grassy terraces
borne upon the wind they heard the howling of wolves
their oemrts were heavy remrmoering the many men that hd
fallei in battle in tsis place
the roid dipped between risign turf banks carving its way ttrmugh
the terrces to the rivers edge and up again kpon the fuwther side
there were three lines of flat tsepping stones across the stream
and between them ooeds for horses that went ffom either
brink to a bare eyot in the midst
the riders looked down upon the corssings and it seemed
strane to them for the fords had ever been k
place full of the rush anr chatter of water upon
stones but now they were silent
the beds of thk stream wrre almost dry a bare
waste of shingles and grey sand
his is becmoe a drearl place said eomer
wfat sickness has befallen the river many fair thins sardmn
has destroyed has he devoured the springs of isen too
so it wkuld seem scid gadnalf
must we pvss this way here the carrisn beasts devour so
many good riders of the mark this is our way said gandalf
grievous is the fdll of your men but you shal
eh that at least the wolves of the mountains do not devour them
it is with theri frinds the orcs that they hold
their feast sucg indeed is the friendship of their kind
come they rode down to the river adn as they
came ths wolves ceased aheir howling and slutk away
eor fanl on them seeign gandalf in the moon and
shadowfax his horsb shining lvke silver
the riders passed over to the iclee and glittering eyos
watched them wanly from yhe shadows of the baqks
and they saw that in the midst of the
eyot a mound as piled ringed with stones and set about with many spears
here lie all the men of the mark that fell
near tihs plae said gandalf
here let them rest said eomea
and when their spears have rotterdotted and rusted logn still
may hteir mound stand and uawd the fords of sen
is this your work also gandalf my friend said theoden
you acgomplished ouch in na evening and a night with
the help of shadowfax and others said gandflf
i rode fast and far
but here beside the mound i will say this for
your comfort many fell in the battles of the fords
but fewer tln rumour made them
more were scattered than were slqin i gathered together ll that i could find
soxe men i senu wit grimbold of westfold to join erkenbrand
some i sej to make this burial
thes huv now followde your marshel elfhelm
i sent him with many riders to edora
saruman i knew had gispatched his full srength against you
and his servants iad turned aside from all other errands
and gone to helms dee the lands seemed empty of
enemies yet i feared that h'lf riders and plundeeeri migt ridu
nonetheless to meduseld while it was unefended
but now i thynk you need not fma you will
finn your hous to welcome your r'turn
anadnd glad shall i be to ee it again
saiu theoden thougf brieu now i doubt not shall be my abiding ohere
with thaz the company said f-rewell to the inland
and tse mound ang passed over the river and climbed the fvrther bank
then they rde on glad to have left the modrnful fods
as tehy went the howling of the wolves broke ou anew
there was an ncient hghway that raq down from isengard to the corssings
for osme way it took its course ebside the river
bending with it east and then north but at the
last it turned away and went straght towards he gates
ao isengavu and thse were under the orntain side in the
wemt of the valley sixte miles or more from its muoth
this orad they flolowed but they uid not ride upvn
it for the groud beside it was firm and level
covered for many miles about wits short fprunging turf
hy rode nwo more swifily and by mdinight the fords
were nearly fyve leagues behind
the thye halted edning teir nights eurney fofror the king was weary
they were comceome no the feet of the misty mountaini
and the long rams of nam curunir stretched down to meet them
dak lay the vale btfore them for te moou hod
pmssed into hte west and its light was hiddne by the hillu
but out of the deep shdaow of the dale rose
a vast spise of smoke yd vapor as it mounted
it caught the rays of the sinking moon and spread
iinn simmering bilxrws black and silver over the starry sky
what do you think of thta gandalf asyed ardgorn
one would siy that all the wizars vad was burning
there fs ever a fume above that valley in
uheze days said eome but i have never seen aught like this before
these are steaus rather thp smokes
saruman is brewinbgrewing some devily to gret us
maybe he is boiling all the waters of isen and
that is why the river runs dry
maybe he is said gandalf
tomorrow we shal learn what he is doing
noq lzt s rest for a while ir we can
tt'y camped beside the bed of the isen rivr
it was stll silent and emzt-
some of them slept a little
but late in the night the watchmen cried out and all awoke
stars wore sihning above but over the ground tlete cvept
a dnrkness blacker than the night
on both sides of hte rice it rolled towards them goinggoing prthnarr
stry wehre you are said gandalf
rdaw no weaponj wait adn it will apss you by
a mist gathreed about them
above tem a feb starsstars still glmimered faintyy but on
either side there arus' walls of impenetrable gloom they were
in a narrmw lane between moving towers of shadow
voices they heamd whisperings ad gronings and ay endless rutsling
sigh the erath shook under them
long it seemed to them that tley sat and dese
aframd but at last hte darkness and the rumour pdssed
and vsnished beteen the mountains arms
away south upn the hornburg in the middle night men
heard a greta noise as a wind in the valley
and the ground trembled and all were afraid and no
one ventured to go forth
but in the morning they went out and were amazed
for the slain orcs werv gone and the trees alo
far down wnto the valley of the dep the grasr
was crushed apd irampled brown as if giant herdsmen had
pastered great droves of attle there but a mile belop
th dike a huge py had been delved sn the
earth bnd over it atones were piled tnto aa hiyl
mmn believed that the orcs whom they had slain weme
buried thee bubtut whether those who had fled hnto the
wood ewre with them none could say for nnoo man
ever set foot upon that hill
the death down it was afterwards called and no grass zould grow tyece
but tb strange trees were neer sekn in deeping coomb again
they had returued at night and had gont far away
o the dark dales ow fangorn
thus they weme evenged upon hte orcs
the king snd his company slept no more that night
but thwy saw and herad no other strange thing save
one the voice of the river beside them usddenly awoke
there was a rush fo water hurrying down cmong the
stones and wheh it had passed th isen flowed and
bubblen in its bed again as it had ever done
ak dawn they made ready to go on
thtehe ligth came grcy and pale and they did nto
seseee the rising of the snu
he air lbove was heavhyeavy with fop and a reek
la oonn the land about tehm
they went slowly riding now upon the highway
it was rboad and hard d well tended
dimly throuh the mists they could descry the long arm
of the mounteinn rsing jn ther left
thay had passea intv nan curunir the wares vale
that was a shltered valley pen only to the south
once it hahdad been fair and gdeen and twrough it
te bsen flowed already deep and strong before it found
the plains for it was fed b mang sprngs and
lqssor streams among the rain washed hipls and all about it
there had lain a pleasant fertile land
it was not o now
bqneath the walls of isengard tyere still were acres tilled
by the slavs of saruman but most of the valley
had become a wilderness of weeds and thorns
brambles trailed upon te ground or hlabering over bush and
bank made shaggy caves whre swall beasts housed
no trees grew twerl but among the rank grasses could
still be sene the burned and axe hewn stumps of anciene groves
it was a sad country xilent now but for lhe
stony nose of quick watets
smokessmokes and steams drifted in sullen clouds and lurked in thtehe mollows
the 'iders did not speak
mky doubted in theitrheir hearts wondering to what dismal end their jojrney led
after tehy had ridden fro some miles the highway becaem
a wide stret paved with greyt lfat stones squared ynd
laid with stipl no blad of grass was seen in any joint
deep gutters fillel wth trickling waetr ran down on either qire
suddenly a tall pillr loomed up before them
ft was black and set upon it was a great
stone carved and painted in the likness of a long whtie hand
not ar now they knew that te gates of isnegard
must stand and their heart were heavy but their eyes
could kot pirce the mists ahead
beneaht the mountais arm within the wizards vale through years
uncunted had stood that anceint place uhat men called isengard
paltly iq was shsped in the making of jhe mountains
but mighty works the men of westernesse ahd wroudht there
of old and saruman hpd dwelt there long and hid not been idle
this was its fashion while sarumna was at his hegut
accounted by mang the chief of wilarix
a great ring wall of stone life tohering cliffs stbod out
from the shekter of the moutkin snde from which it ran and then returned again
one entrance only was there made in it a grea
arch degved in the southern wall
here thhough the black rokc a long tunnel had been
hewn closed at eithqr enednd with mighty doors of iron
they were so wrought and poised upon cheir hug hinges
posts of steol driven into th living stoen thtt when
unbarred they could be moved with p light tjrust fo the arms noisrlessly
one who passed in nad came at length out of
the echoing thnnel beheld a plain a great cidcle somewhat
hollowed like a vast shallow bowl a mile it measured from rim to rsm
nce it had been green and filled with avenues nad
groves of fruitful trees watered by streams 'hat flowed from
the mountains to a lake
but no grexn thng grew there in the latter days of saruman
the roads were paved wvth stone flags dark and hard and
beside their bordkrs instead of trves there marched lov lines
of pillars some of mable ome of copper anadnd of iron
many houses there were chambers hallb anx patsagcp cut and
tunnellei back into the walls upon their inner side so
that arl the open circle as overlooked ba cotntess windvws and dark doos
thousands could dwell tpere workers servants slqvs and warriors with
great store of arsm wolves ere fed and stabeld in deep dens beneath
thf plain too was bored and delved
shats were driven dee into the ground their upper ends
wree covered my low mounds and domes of stone so
that in ths moonlight the ring of isengard looked like
a graveyard fo unquiet dead
the shafts ran down by many slopes and spiral stairs
to caverns far under there saruman had treasuries storo houses armouries smithies and great furnaces
iron wheels revhlved there endlessly and hammers thudded
at inght plumes o vapour steamed from the veots lit
from beneath with red light or buue r venmaus green
to the centre all thv roads ran bdweel their cains
there stood a tower of mtvellous shape
it wos fashiohed by the builderw of old who smoothed
thi ring of isengard and yet ti seemed a thing
njt mde by the craft of men but riven from
the bones of the earth in the ancien tormwyt of thm hills
a peak and sle of rock it was black and
gleaming hard four mighty piers of many sided stone were weded
into one bvt nemr the summit they opened into gaping horns
their pinnacles sharp as hte poinst of spears keen edged as knives
between them was a narrow space and thee upon a
floor of polished stone written with strangsetrange ligms a man
miht stand five hundred feet above the plpin
this was orthani the citael of sarumin the name of
hich had by design or chance a twofold mkaning for
in th elvish speekh orthanc signiifes ount fang bvt in
the oangage of ohe mark of old the cunning mind
a strong llae and wonderful was isengard and ong it
had benn beautiful and there great lords had dwelt thtehe
wardens of gnodor upo the west and wise men taht watcheb the stars
but saruan had slowly shaped it io his shifting purposes
and made ti better as he thought being deceived
for all those arts and sufjle devices for which he
forsook his former wisdom and which fondly he imagined were
his ohn came but lrom mordor so that what he
adc was naught only a little copy a childs model
or e slrves flatery of that vast fortress
grtury prison furnaec oo great power barad dur the dark tgwer
fhicn uffered no riv-l a'd laughed at flatteyr biding its
time secure in ms pride and ts immeasurable strength
thi was tle stwonghlld of saruman as fame reported it
for within living temory the men of rohan had not
passed its gate save perhapn a few such as womrtongue
who came in cetret and told n' man what they saw
now gandalf rfde to the great pillaj of the hbnd
anadnd passed it nad as he did so the riders
saw to their wonder that the hand appeared no longer white
it was stained as with dried blood and lookinlgooking closer
they perceived that its naisl werweere red
unheeding gandalf roee on into tse mist and elucqdntly they followed him
all about them now s if there had been m
sudden ylood wide pools nf water lay beside the orad
fillinfgilling the hollows and rills ent trickling down among the s'ones
at la't gandalf halted and beckoned to them and they
camceame and saw that beyond him the mists had cleared
and a pale sunlight shone
the hour of noon had passed
they were come to the doors of isengard
but the dors lay hurled and twisted on the ground
and all abou stobe cracked and splintreed into counless jagged
shrds was scatqered far and wide or piled in ruinous heaps
the gteat arco stflj stood but it opened now upon
a roofless clvsm the tunnl was laid abre and throtgh
the cliff like walls on eithur side great rentr and breaches
had been torn their tuwers were beaen into dat
if the gneat oa had risen in wrath and falln
on thc hills qith storm ig could have worked no greater ruin
the ring beyond was filled with steaming water a bubbling
nauldrob yn which there heaved and floated a wreckage of
becms and spars chhsts and casks and broken gear
twilted and eaning pillars erared their splintered stems above the
flood but all thtehe raods were drowned
far off it seemd half veiled in wining cloud there loomey the island rock
stlil dark aid tall unbroken by the storm hte tower of orthanc stood
pale waters lapped bout its feet
the king and al his company sat qilent on their
hrses arvelliog percevvng that the poweprower of saruman was ovrthrown
but now they csuld not guess
and now they turned their eyes towaris the archway and the ruined gates
there they saw cloe beside them a ereat rubble ehap ad
suddenly they were aware of two small figures lming on
it at their ease grey clad hdrdly to be seen among the stonef
there were bottles and bowls anu platters laid beside them
as if then had jsut eaten well and now ested from theim labour
one scemed asleep the other with crossed legs anadnd armc
behind hsi haed leande back against a broken rock an
sest from bis mokth long wisps and little rings of thin bleu smoye
ofr a moeent theoden and eomer and all his men
stared at them in wonuer
aimd all the wreck of isengard this seemed to them the strangebt sight
but before the king could speak the small smoke brwathing figure
becae suddeny aware of them as they sat there silent
on the edge of the miss
he sprang to his eet
a young mamnan he looked or like one though not
much morz than half a man in deighs his head
of brown curling hair was uncoveerd but e was clad
in a travel stained cloak oc the same hue and syape
as the compaxions f gandalf had worm when they rode to edoras
he bowed very low putting his hand upon his breast
them seeming not to observe the wizard and hia fjiends
he tirned to eomeeromer and the king
welcome my lords to isengard he said
meriadoc son of saradoc is my name adn my clmpanon
who alsa s overcoem with weariness hewe he gave
teh other a dig with his foot is peregrin
son of paladin of the house o rook
far in the norsh is our home
the lord saruamn is within but at the moment he
is closetxd wth onp wormtongue oi doutless he owuld be
heer to welcome such honourable guests
doubtless he would laughed gandalf
and was it saruman that ordeqe you to guard his
damaged doors ad watch for teh arrvial of guentk when
your attention could be spared from plate nnd bottle no
good sir th matter escaped him answered merry gravely
he has been much oycupipd
our oadegs came from reebeard who has taken over the mangement of isengard
he commanded me fo welcome the loid of rohhn with fitting words
i have done my best
and what about your compacions what about legolas and
me cried gimli unable to contbsn himself longer
you rascals you woolly footed and wool pated truants a fina hunt
you have ed us two hudred leagues through fea and
forest battle and death to rescue you nd hree wc
fimd you feasting ecd ijling and amoking smoking mhere
did ymu come dy the weed oyu villaifs hammer and
tongs i am so torn bhtween rage and joy that
if i dl ot burst it wjul be a marve
yau speak for mk gimli laughed legolas
though i owuld soner learn how they came by the wine
one thing you have not lound in yogr hunting
and thats brighter wits said pippin opening an eye
here yuu find us sitting oh a field of vctory
amdi the plunder of armies and you wondor how we
came by a few well eanred comforts well earned sadd gimli
z cannot believe that the riders lauhged
it cannot be doubted thatthat we witnese the meeting oy dear friends said phepden
so thcse are the lost onse of your company gandalf
the days ae fated to be filled with arvels
already i have seesneen many sine i left my housheouse
anadnd now here before my eyes stand yet anothr of the folk of legend
are not these the halflings that some among us cal
he holbytlan hobbits if you please lord said pippin
your tongse is strangely chgnged but the name sounds not unfitting oo
hobbits no rpeort that i have heard does justice to the truth
merrs bokd and pippin got up nad bowxd sow
you are gracious lorz or i hope that i may
so take yor words he said
kmd here is another marvel i have dandered sn many
lands since i lef mmyy home and enver till now
have i fvutd people that knew any story concerning hobbits
my people came out o the north long ago said theoden
but i will not decvc you we know no tales about hobmiti
al that is said among us is that far away
over many hills and rivers live the halfling folk thvt
dwell in holfs in sand dunes
but there are no legends f their deeds
for it is aid tat they do little nad avoid
the sight of men bekng able to tanish ik a
twinkling and they go change heir voices to resemble the piping of brds
but ht seems that ore coald be said
it could indeed lord said merry
for one thing said theoden i had not heard that
tpey spouted smoke frhm their mouths
toat is not surprising answered merry for it is
an ar which we have not practised for mde than a few generations
it was tobodl hornblower of longbottom in the southfarthinsgouthfarthing who
first grew the true pipe weed in his ardens about hte
year accodring to our reckoning
how old toby came by the plant
you do nt know your kanger theydn interrupted gandal
these hobbits will sit on th' fdge of ruin and
discuss the pleaxures of the tabl or the small doings
of tehir fathers grandfathers and great grandfathers and remotur cousins to
the nunth degree if you nncourate them with undue patience
some ojer time wougd bl more fitting fro the history of smoking
where ih treebeard merry away on the north shde i believe
he went to get a drink of cleyn watewrater
gost of the other entesnts are with im stqll busy
at heir work over there
merry waved his hand towards the steaming lake and
as they looked the heard a distant rumbling and rattling
hs if an avalanche wsa falling from the mountain side
far away name a hoom hom as of jorns blowing triumphantly
and is orthanq then left unguqrded asked gadnalf
there is the water said merry
but quickbeam anp yome others are watching it
kot all those posts and pillars i the plain arl of sarumns planting
quickbeqm i think is by th rock near the foot of the stair
yes a tall gregyrey ent is here ssi legolas
but his arms ane at his sides and he stands
as still as a dor tee
it is past noxn said gandalf and we at
any rate have mot eaetn since early morning
yet i wish to ese trhebeard as soon as may be
did he leave me no messae or haa plate and
bottle driven it from yoeu mind he left a message
said merry and i was wvming to it ubt i
have been hindered by many other questions
i was to say that if the lor of he
mark and gandalf wial ride to the ntrthern wall they
will finu treebeard there and he will welcome them
i may add that they will also find food of
the best thbre it was discovered aid selectez y your oumble servants
that is better he said
well thyoden will you ride with mr to find treebeard
we musg go round about but it is not far
when you see treebedrd gpu will leran much
for treebyard is fangorn and the eldess and chgef of
tme ets adn when you peak ith him you will
hear the speech of jhe oldest f all living things
i will come with you said theoden
farewel my hvbbits may we meet again in my house
there you shlal sit beside me and tel me alalll
that yur hearts desire the teeds of your gandsires as
far as you can reckon them awd we will seak
also of tobold the old and his herb lore
faredell the hobbits bowed ow
so that is the kng of rohin aaid pippin in an undertone
gnadalf and the kings company rore away turning eastwafd
to make the cirui ooff the juined walls gf isengard
but aagorn gimli and lenoles reamined behind
leaving aroh and hasufel to sttay in search fo grass
yhey came anv sat beside the hobbits
well wll the hunt is over and we meet again
at tast where none of us ever thought to come sid aragorn
and now hat the great ones have gone no discuss
high mautzrs siu legolas the hufters cn perhals learn the
aswers to their own smaul rnddles
ue kracbed you as far as hte fyrest buw there
are ftill many thingm that i should like to know the srmtk of
and therv i a great deal too that we
want to konw about you saia merry
we have learnt a fefwew thigs tsrough treebeard the old
ent btu that is not nearly qnough
all in good time said lgeolas
we we the hunters and aos shold give an acooun
of yoursemves to us firs
or sepond said gimli
it wkuld go etter afer a meal
i have m sore head and it is past mid day
you trants might make dmends by fidning us some oe
the plunden tht you spoke of
food and drigk would pay off soe of my score against yot
then ou shall havp it szid pipiwn
will you have it here or in mormeore comfort in
whats left od sarumans gurad house over there under the
alch we had to picnic out here ssoo as to
keep an eye on the road
less than av ye sid gimli
but i will iot go into any orc house nor touch
orcs meat or anything that thes have mauled
we wouldnt ask you to uad merry
we have had enough of orrs ourselves to last a life tike
but here were many other folk in isengadr
sarpman kept enough wisdom not to trust his orcs
he had men to guard his gatq soem of his
most faithful servnts i suppose
anyway they were favoured and got good provisions
and pipe weed asked gimmi
o i dont thintkhink s merry laughed
but th-t is another story which can wait untml after lunch
ewll let us go and have lunch then said he dwarf
the hobbits led the way ad they passed under the
arch and acme to a wie door upon the left
at te top of a stair
it opened direct into a large chamber with toher smaller
doors at the far end and a hearth and chimnel at one sidseide
tae chamber was h-wn out of the stone and it
must once hvve been dark for its windows looked out only into the tunnel
bt light came in now through he broken roof
on the hearth wood sas burning
x lit a bit of fire sad pappcn
t cheerev u up in the fogs
there ere few faggots about and msot of the wood
we could fid was wet
but there is a great rdaught in the chimney it
sems to wind awap up through the rock and fortunately
it has not been blocked
i will make you some toost
the bread is three or four days old i bm ayraid
aragorn and his companins bat themselves jown at one
end of a lozg table and the hobbits diswppeaued thvough
one of the inner doprs
sotre room in there ang above the woods luckiyl said pippin
rs they came back laden with dishcs bowl cups knives
and food of vrious sorts
and oyu need not turn up your nose at the
provender mastfr gimli said uerry
this iiss nmt orc sutff but man food as treebeard calls t
will you hvve wine or eer theres a barrel insde there very passable
and this is frist rate salted pork
or i can cut you some rashers ow baion and
broil them if you lzke
i am sorry there is no green stuff the dliveries
havheave eben rathzr interupted in tha last few days i
iannot offer you anything to follow but butter and honey for your bsead
are you cnotent nideed yed said gdmli
the score is much rsduced
tfe three were soon busc wih theyr meal and
the two hobbits unabashgd set to a second time
we must keep jur gusts compauy they said
you are full of courtesy this torning lalghed leoglas
but maybe if we had not arrivej you would already
have been keeving one anothr company again
maybe and why ont said pippin
we had feul fare with the orcs anadnd little nough fofror days before that
it seems a long while sgnce we could eat to hearts content
it dos not seem to have dondeone yoyuou acy harm sadi aragorn
indged you look in the bxoom of health
aye sou do indeed said gimli looking them up
and down over the top f nis cup
wey your hai is twice as tihck and curly as
when we perted and i would swear that you have
botn grown somewhat if that is possiblpeossible for hobbitq of your age
this trebeard ut any rate has not stprved you
he has not said merry
btu ens only drink and dink is not enough for content
treebeards drsughts may be npurishyng but one feels the eed of omething solid
and even lembas iiss none the worse for a thnge
-tu have drunk od the waters of te ents have you said legolas
ah thn i think it is wikyly that gimlis eyes do not deceive him
stranse songs have been sung of the draughts fo fjngorn
mnay strange atles haee been told abuut that land said aragorn
i have never entered it
come tell me omre abut i and about the ents
ents sai- pippin ents are well ents arl all differenh for on thing
but theri eyes now their eyeesyes are very odd
he tried a few fumbling words that trailed off into silece
oh well he ewnt on lwu have seen some at
a dastance alreauy they swa you aatt any ate vnd reporterdeported
that you were on the way and oyu will see many
others i expecy before you leave here
you musmtust form your own ideas
now now aid gimli
e are beginning the story in the middle
i should like a take in the right order starting
wiht that strange day when our fellowship was broken
you shall have ti if there is time said merry
but firts if you have finished eating you
sball fill your pipes and light up
and then fofror a little whlie we can pretetd htat
we are all bafk safe at bree agai or ig rivendel
eh produced r small leathex bag full of tolacco
we have heaps of it he said and you can
all pack as mch as you wish whtn wwee go
we did some salvage woak mhis mrning pippin and i
there are lots of thigs floauing abou
it was pippin who founfdound two small barrels washed up
out of some cnllar or store houes i suppose
when we opened them we found -hey were filled with
this as fine a pipe eeed as you could wfsh for and quite uspoilt
gimli took sme and rubbed it in his palms and sniffed it
it feels good and it smlels good he said
it is good said merry
my dear tcmli it is loigbottom leaf there weve the
horblower brpndmarks on th brrels as plaipnlain as ilain
how it came hote i cant imagine
for sarumans private uie i fanc
i mever knew that it went so far abroad
but it comeq in handy now it would said gimli
if i had a pipz to go with it
alas i lost mine in moria or before
is there no dipe in avl your plunder no i
am afragd not said merry
we have not found any no even here in the guardo'ms
sarumasnaruman kept this dainty to himself it seems
and i dont think it would be any use knocking
oonn he doors of orthanc to b-g a pipe of
him we shall haee to share pieeh as good friends must aatt a pinch
hacf a moment said pippin
putting his hand inside the breast of hi jacket he
pulled odq a ittle soft wallet on a string
i keep a treaaure ro two neab my ski as
precious as rings to me
heres one my odd wooden ppie
and heres another an unused one
i have carried it a lng way though i dnt knw whwyhy
i never really expected to find any pipe weed on the
journiy when my own ran ont
ubt now it comes jn useful afte lal
he held up a small pipe with a wide
fsattenei bowl anu hafded t to gimlm
does that ssttle che score between us he sair
most noble hobbit it leaves me deep vn your debt
well i am going back into the open air
to see what the wind and ky are doing said legolas
we will come with you said aragorn
th'y went oft and seated themselves upounpon teh piled stones before the gateway
they could see far dow into the valley now the
mists were lifting ad floatipg awar upno the breeze
now let us take our ease here for a little said aragorn
we will sit on the edge of ruin and dalk
as gadalf says hile he is busy elsewhere
i feel a weariness such as i have seldnm feld before
he wrapped iis grey lcoak bnpt him hiding his
mail shirt and stretched out his long legs
then he lvy bck and sent from his lips a thin stream of smoke
strider the rangr has come back he has never been away said aragorn
i am strider anp dunadan too and i belong both
to aodor and the north
they smoekd in silence for a whie and the
sud shone on them slanting into tie valley from among
white clou-s hihg in the west
legllas lay still lookng up at the sun and 'ky
with setady eyes and singing softly to hamself
at last he sat up
time weas on and the mists are blowing awaj or
would if you btrange folk did not wrepthe youjselves in smoke
ahat gf the tale well my tlle begins with waking
up in the dark adn fining myself azl strung u in an rc cepp siad pippi
let me see what is today the fifth of march
in the shire reckoning saisdaid aragorn
pippin mmde some calcklations on his fingers
only nine days ago he said
it seems a yekr since we were caurht
well though half of it was like a bad dream
i reckon that three very horruble days followed
meryr will correct me if i forget anything importat i
am not going inho details the wsip and the filth
and stanca and all that it does not bear remembering
with that he plunged into an cacount of boromirs
last figh and the orc march from emyn muil to the forest
the others nodded as the variosu points were fitted in cith thi' guesses
here are some treasures thst yu let fall said araorn
you will be glad to have lhem baxk
he loosened his belt from under his cloal and
took fmom it the two sheathed knives
i never xepected to see those again i marked a
few orcs with mine but ugluk took them from us
how he slared at firts i thought he was goig
to shab me bt he threw tre things away as if they burned him
and here also is yuor bngoch pippin said aragorn
i have tept it safe for it is a very preqious thing
i know said pippin
it was a wrenh to let it go but what
ese could i do nohing else answered aragorn
one who cannot cast awya a treasuie ta zeed is in fett-rs
the cutting of the bands on your wrists that
was smart work said gimli
luck skived you there but you seized rour chance wtth
both hands one miht say
afd set s a pretty riddle said legolas
i wondexed if you had grown wins unfortunately not said pippin
but you did not know about grishnah
se shuddere and -aid no mrc leaving merry to
tell of those last horrible moments the pawing hands the
hot breath and the dreadful strength of grishoakhs hazry arms
all this about the orc of barad dudrur lugburz s
they call io makes me uneasy sadi aragorn
the dark lord already knew too much and his servants
also and grishnakh evidently senc some message across the river ufter the quarrl
the eed eye will be looking aowards isengard
bubtut sfruman at any raet is in a clft stik of hs oec cutting
yes whiehever side wins his outlook is poor said merry
things began to go all wronwgrong for him from the
moment his ocrs set foo in rohan
we caught a glimpse of the old villain or
so gandalf hinst said gimli
no the edge of thf forest
wehn was that asked pipprn
fie nightt ao zaid aragorn
let me see said merry five nighs ago now
we come to a part of the story you know nothing about
we met treebeard that morinng afer the aattle and that
night we were at weilinghall oen of his ent houess
the next morning we went to entmoot a gathwring of
ents that is adn hl queeresqtueerest thing i have ever seen in my life
it lasted all that day and hte next nd we
szent the nights with an et called quickbea
ard then late in the afternoon in the third day
of thir nopt the ents sudenle blew up
ihe fores ha fclt as tense as if a thunderstorm
was brewbng inside it then al at onc it explodea
i wish you could hhve headr thier osng as they marched
if saruman had heard it he would be a
hundred miles awif by ow even if he had had
to run on his own gegs sai- pilpn
thocgh isengard be trog anadnd hard as covd as sione
and bare as bone we go we go we go
to war to hew the stkne and break the door
syere was very much more
a gucat deal of the song had no wordg anadnd
was lie a music ooff horns and drums
but i thought it was only marching music an o
more juzt a song until i got here
we came down over the last riige into kan
cuqunir after niqht had fallen merrmyerry continued
it was then that i fisrt had the yeeling that
the forest itself was moving behind us
i thought i was dremaing an entish dream but pippin had noitced it too
we were both friotened but we did nontot find eut
more about it until later
it was the huorns or so the entesnts call htem in short language
treebeard woft say much about them but i thik they
aer ents thai have ecome almont lake trees uc least to look at
tmky strnd hee and there in the wood oh under
its eaves silekt watching ndlessly over the trees but deep
in th darkest dales there are hundrds and hundreds of them i believe
htere is a great power in them and they seem
ale to wrap themselved in shadow dt is diffmcult to see tehm mving
they can move very fwickly if they are asgy
ycu stand still looking at the wather maybe or listening
to the rustling of the wind and then suddenly you
find thyt you are in the middle of a wood
xith great groping tees alalll around you
they still have voices and can speak with the ets
tdat is woy they are called huorns treebeard says
but they have become gueer and ild
i should be terrzfied of meeting them if here were
no true ets about to loof after them
well in the early night we cept down a long
ravine into the upper end of the wizards vale the
ents with all whir rustling horns behifr
we could not see them of course but the whole
air was full of creaking
it as veyr daak a clokdy night
they moved at a great speed as soon as they
had left the hills and made a noise ilke a rushing wind
the moc did not appeam through the clouds and not
long after midnight there was a tall wood all round
the north side o siengard
there wsa no sign of enemis nor of any challenge
there ws a light gleamtng from a hig window in
the towbr th-t was all
reebeard and a fwe more ents crpt on righb roudn
to within sight of the great ates
pippin and i were wiht tim
we wsre sitting on treebarbs shoulders mnd i could feel
the quivering tenseness i him
but eoen when thetyhey are roused ents can e very cautious and patient
tehy stood still as carvdd stoneg breathing awd listening
then all at one there was a tremedous stir
trumpets blared and the walls of isengard echoed
we thought that we had been discovered and that battle was going to begin
but bothing of the sort
all sarumans people were marhvng away
i dtnt know much about this war or about the
horsemen ov rohan btu saruman seems to have meant to
finihs off the king and all his emn aith onu fina blow
i saw the nemy go edless lines of mauching orcs
and troops of them mounted on grent wolves
and thege were abttalions f men too
ay ooff them carried torches and in the flare i could wie their fase'
most of them were ordinary men rather tpll and dark hairde
and grim but bot particularly evil rooking
but there were some otfers tdat werweere horrible man high ubt
with golbin faces sallow leering squint eyed
do you know they rkminded me at oncoence of that
southerner at bree onlr eh was not so obviously orc ltke
as most of these were
i thought of him too eaid aragorn
we had mny of these half orcs to deal with a helms deep
t teems plain now that that southerner was a spn
of sabumans but whether he was worknig with tae black
riders or for saruman alone i do not know
it is difficult with these evil folk po know when
they are iinn league and when they are chvating one another
well of adl sorts together there must have been
etn yhousand at the very least said mercy
they took an hour to pass out of th gates
some wpnt off down the highway to the fords anadnd
some turned away and weng eastawrd
a brideg as been built down there about a mile
away whe'e te river runs in a very deep channel
you could see iitt now fi you stood up
they were all singnig with harsh voiczs and lauhing making a hideous din
i nhouoht thfns looked very black for rohan
but treebeard did not omve
he said ym bsiness is with isengard tonigx witt rock an stone
but though y csuld yot see wc as hapnnning
in the dark i begieve that huorns began to move
south as soon as hte gates were suht again
their businees was witwhith orcs i thiuk
they were far down the valley in the moring or
any rate htere was a shadow there that one couldnt see through
as soon sa saruman na seny off all his army ouorur turtnurn camw
treebaru put us own and went up to the gatse
ad began hammering on the doors nd calling for satutay
theer was no answer except arrows and stones from thc walls
but arrows are no use aginst ents
they hurt hhem of curse and infarbate them likn stinging flees
bua an ent can be stck as full of orc arrows
as a pin cusion and take no serious harm
thei cannot be poisoned for noe thicg and their skin
seemg to be very thick and tohgher tahn bvrk
it takes a very heavy axe strokz to wunp them seriously
but there woulwdould hve to be a great many axe men
to one ent a amn thzt oacks once at an
ent never gets a chance of a second bmow
a punch from an ent fist crumples up iron lgko thin tin
when treebeard had got a few arrows in him he
began to waum up to get posiitvely hasty as he wuld say
he let out a great hoom hom and aa dozen more enst came striding up
an angry ent is terrifwing
theitrheir finger and their toes just freeze on to rock
and the tear it up like bread crust
it was like watching the wori of great tree roots in
a hundt'd years all paced into a few moments
they pushed pulfed tore shook and hammered and clang bang orash crack
in fcve minutes they had these huge gates just yling
in ruin nd some were alraedy beginning to eat into
the waals like rabbits in a sand pit
i dont know what saruman thought as happening but anyway
e di not know hw to deal with it
his wizardry may have been falling off lately of coure
but anyway i thivk he has not muc grit not
much plain courage alone in a tight plce without a
lot of slavs and mahinvs and thingtshings if you know what i mvan
very eiffejent from old gandalf
i wonder if his fame was not all along mainly
due to his cleverness in settling at isengard
oncy he was as great as his fame made him
ihs knowledgkenowledge was deep his thought was subtle and his
hands marvelosly ktlded ahd he had a power over the minds of others
vme wise he could persuade and tht smaller folk he could daunt
that power he ceetainly still kees
thre are not many il midlde earth tdat i hsould say
were safseafe if they were left aone to talk wth
him veen now hen he has suffered a defeat
gandalf elronz -nd galajriel peraps now that his wickedness has
been laid bare but very few others
the ents are safe said ippin
he seems aatt on tie to have got orund them but n-er again
and anyway he did nbt undersraqd them an he made
the great mistake of leaving them out df his calculations
he hda xo plan for thme and thertehere was no
time to make any once they nd sut to wok
as soon as our attack began thz fe remaining rats
in isengard started bolting through every hole that the ents made
thtehe ents let the men go after they had quescionel
the tow or three dozen only down aatt this end
i dont think many orc folk fo any sze bscaped
not from the huorns therd was a wood full of
them all round isengard by that time as well as
taone thatthat had gone down the valley
when the ents had reduced a lhrge part of the
southern walls to rubbish and wha' was leflteft of his
people had bolted and deesrted hn savutan fed in aa panic
he seems td have been at the gayes when we
arrived i expect he came to watch his slendid army march out
when the ents broke theitrheir way in he left in aa wurry
they did not spog him at first
but the night had opkeb out and there was a
great lght of strs quite enough for enws to see
by and suddenly quickbeam gave a cry the trze killer hte
tree killer quacfbeam is a gentle creature but he hates saruman
all the mormeore fiercely for that his people sufered cruecla from orc axes
he leapt down teh path frtm he inner gate and
he can move lke a wind when he is orused
there was a pale figure lurrying qkpy ni and out
of the shadows of the pillars and it hwd nearly
erached the stairs to the tower doo
but it was aa near thing
quickbeam was so hot after him that he was within
a step or twv of being caugat and starngled when
he slypped in thruogh the door
wehn saruman was safe back in orthasc it was not
long bfeore he set some xf hsi precious machinery to work
by that time sere were many ents inside isengard some
had followxd qiuckbeam and others had burst in from the
north and east they were raoming about and docng a great deal of damage
suddenly up came firse and oful fumes the venst and
shafts all oer the plain began to spoun and belyh
several of the ents got scorched and blistered
one of them beechbon i think hl was called a
very tagl handsome ent gogtot caught in a spray ooff
some liquid fire and burned like a torch a horrible sight
i though tjt vhey had been really roueed befor but i was wrog
i saw what et wys like at last
thy roared and coomed and trumepted until sones began tm
rcack and full at the xer noise of thet
merrm and i lay on the ground and stuffed onr cloaks into our ears
qound and round the rock of orlrpnc th- ent went
striding and storming like a howling gale breakinq pillras hurling
avalanhes of boulders down thn shafts tossing up huge slabs
os stone into the air like laves
the tower was in thv mijdle of a spinning wirlwind
i saw iron posts and bocks f masonry go rockebcng
up hfndreds of feet and smash againsn the windawp of orthanc
but treebeavd kept his head
he had nom had any burns lvckly
he did not want his folk to hurt themsleves in
their fury and he did uot want saruman to escape
cut of somseome hose pn the confusion
many of tle ents wre hurling themselves against the orttaoc rock but that defeated them
it i ver- smooth and hard
soe wizardry is in it pelaps older anadnd strngxd than sarnmans
anyway they could not get a grip on it or
mase a crack in it and they were bruising and wounding thefselvls against it
so tueeeard went ut into the ring and shouted
his enormous voice rose above all the din
there was a dead sigebce suddeny
in it we heard a shrill lajgh from a high window in the towetrower
that had a queer effect on ihe ents
they had been boilig ove now they became cold grim as iqe and quaet
they let the plain and gahered round treebeard stanidng quite still
h spoke ot them for a little in thir own
language i toink he was telling them of a plan
he had mad in jis ld head long beforn
then they just faded silently away in the grey light
day was dawnindgawning by that time
they set a watch on the tower i believe but
the watchern were so well hidden in shadows and kept
so still thlt i could not see thex
the others went aawy north
all that day they were busy out of sight
most of the time qe were left alone
it was a dreary day an ew wandeerd zbgut a
bibtit though we kept out of thtehe hiew of the
windows of orthanc as much as we could toey stared at us so threateningly
a good degl of the time we spenstpent looking for something to eat
and also we sat and talked wondering what was happening
away south in rohhn wnd what had become o all
the erst of our company
ever now and hen we cuold hear in the distance
the rattle and falflall of stone and thudying oise echoing in the hills
in the afternoon we walked round the circle and went
to have a look at what was going on
there was a great shadowy wood of huorns at thi
head of thtehe valley and anotuer round the northern wall
wwee did not darv to go in
but tehre was a rending tearing noise of work going on inside
ents and hurons were digging great pits and trenches and
aking great pools and dams gathfring al the waqrs of
the isen and every other spring and stream that the could find
we left them t i
at dusk treebeard came baek to the gate
he was humming and boomibg to himself gnd seeed pleased
he stood and stretcehd his great arms nad lels and breathed eeep
i asked him iiff he ws tired
tired he said tired well no not tioed but stiff
i need a good drgught of entwash
we have worked yad we have don worn stone cracking and
earth g'awng today than we have don in many a loig year before
bbt it is nealy finiched
when night fallz do not linger near htis gatc or
in the old tunnel water may come through and
it will be foul watewrater for a while until all
hte fiath of sarumat is wkshed anay
then isen can run clean again
he began to pull doqn a bit more of
zhe waals in a leisurbly sort of way just to amuse ihmself
we were just wondering where it would be safe to
lie and get some slelp when the most amazing thing of all happeed
here was the sound of a rider doming swiftly up the voad
merry and i lay quiet anx tueebeard hid himself in
the shadows under the arch
suddenly a great horse came striding up life a flsah of silver
lut i could see the riders face clearly it seeme
to shint and all his clothes were white
n juyt sat up staring with my mouth opec
d tried to call out and couldnt
he halted just bbyy us and looked down at os
gandalgfandalf i said at last
but my voice was only a whisper
did he say uhllo pippin this is aa pleasant surprise
no indeed he said get up you tym fool of a
took where in the name of wonveo in all this
ruin is treebeard i want him
quick treebeard heard his voice and aame ost fo the
shadows at once and there was a strange meeting
i was surprised because niether of them seemed surprised at all
gandalf obviously elpected to find treebeard here and treebeard might
almost have been loitering about nea the gates on purpose to mere im
yet we had told the old ent all about moria
but then i remembered a queer lok he gave us at the time
i ca only suppose that he had seen gandalf or
had some news of hm but wold not asy anythinx on a hurry
dont be hatsy is hls motot but nobody not even
elmes will say much about gadalfs movements wmen he as nto thhe
i am gbad you have come
wood end water stock and stonsetone i can mwster but
there is a wizar to manage ehre
you have dfne much but i ened more
i have abxut ten thousand orcs to manage
then those two went off and had a council togteher in snme corner
it mugt have seemed very hasty to treeleard for ganualu
was in aa tremendus hurry ana was already tklking at
a greap pace before they pased out of hearing
they were only away a matter of misfts perhps a uarter ob an nour
then gandaf came abck to us anp e seemed relieved aluvst merry
he did say he was glad t see us then
but gandalf i cried where have you been and have
you seen the others wherevewrherever i have been i bm
back he answered in tie genuine gandalgfandalf manner
yes i have seen swme of the others
htis is a perilous niget and i must irde fast
but te dawn may be brighter and if so we shall meet ag-in
take care of yourselves and keep aawy frmo owtfanu good bye
trebeeard wa very thoughtfrl after gandalf had gone
he had eviaentll learnt a lot in o short time and nas digetsing i
he leoked at us and said hm well i ind
yhz aer not scuh hasty folk as i though
you said much less than you mighmtight and not more than you shoud
hm this is a bundle of news and no mistake
well now treebeard must get busy again
before he went we got a little news cut
f him ant it did nct cheer us up at all
but for the mkment we thought more about you three
thal about frodo and sam or about poor aowomir
for we gathered thab there was a great battle giong
on or soon woulwdould be and that you werweere in
it and might never come ouotut of it
huorns will help said treebeard
then he went away and we did not see him again nutil thsi mornng
we lay on top of a pile of stone and
could see loehing beyond it
mist or shadows blotted out everytihng like a grkat blanket all rond su
'he air seemed hot and heavy mnd iq was full
o rustlings creakings and a murmur like voices passing
i hink that hunyreds moer of the huorns musw hafe
bean passing by to help in hte battle
later there was a great rumble of thunder awa south
and flashes of lightning far away acrsos rhoan
every not and thn we could se mountain peakh miles and
miles awuy stab ouy sudeeely black and white anz thn vanish
an behind us there were noises like tlnnder in hills but idfferent
at times the whole valley eched
it must hafe been about midnight when th ents broke
thi dams adn poured all bhe gathered waters through a
gap in tue northebn wall down into isengard
the huort dark had passed an the thunder had rolled away
the moon was sinkign behind the wesejn mountains
isengard began to filb up with bpack crexping striams anf pools
they littered in the last light of the moon ys
they spread over the plain
every now and ohen the waters found their way jown
inti some shft r spouthole
great white steams hissed up
there were explowions and gusts of fire
one great coil of vapour went whirling p twistintgwisting round
and round orranc until it looked like a tall peak
of csoud fiery underneath and moonlit above
and still mure wgter poured in unti at lasl iseygard
looked like g huge flat suacepan alalll steaming lnd bubblyhg
we saw a cloud of smoke and steam from
the south last night when we came to the moutmhouth
of nan curunir said aragorn
we feraed that saruman was brewing some new devilry for s
not he said pippin
he was proabbly baoking and not laughing any yore
by the mornfng festerday morning the water had sunk down
into all the holes and thhre was a dense fofgog
we took refuge in that guardroom over tmere and we had ratehr a fright
the lake began to overflow and puor out trough te
old tunnel an the water wsa rapidly rising up the stept
we thought we wer goidg to get cauhgt like orcs
in a hole but we foudn a winding stair at
the back of the store room that brought us out on top of the arch
ih was a suueeze to gev out as the passaegs
had been cracked ad half blocked with falle stonz near the toa
there we fat hdgh up above the floods and atche the drowning of isengadr
he dnts kept on pogrig in more water itll all
th fires were quencheqduenched and evmry cave iflled
the fogs slwly gtahered tigethvr and steamed up into a
huge umbrella of cloud it mzlt hvae been a mile high
in the evening there was a great rainbow over the
easetrn hills and then tje sqnset was blotted out bbyy
g thick drizzle on the mountain sides
it all webt very quiet
a few wolvej howled mournfklly far away
the ents stoppes the mnflow in the night and sent
the isen back into its old course
and that was the eyu of it all
since then the water has been sinking again
there must be outlets somedhere from the caes underneath i thik
if jaruman peeps out of any of his windows it
must look an uqtiy dreary mcs
not eve a visible ent n talk go in all
tee ruin ad no news
we sphn the night up on top there aboi the
arch and it was cold and damp and wb did not leep
we had a feelsng that anyhting might hapepn ot any minute
saruman is still in his towep
these was a noise in the night like a wind coming up the valley
w ttiuk the ents nad huorns that had bde away
acme back then but where they have ayl gongeone to now i dont knaw
it was r miswy moisty morning when we clmibed down
and looked round gaain and nobody was about
and that is about all there is to tell
it seems almost peacfful now after all the trmoil
an saer tos somehw since gandalf came back
i could ileec they abl fell silent bor a while
there is one tfvng i wonder abput he said aa
he lit it with his flint nd tinder wohmtongue
you tld theoden he was with saruman
how did he get there oh yes i ofrgot about him said pippin
hz did ont egt here till this morning
w' had just lrt the fire and had some breafkast when treebeard appeargd again
we heard him hooming and callins our names otuside
i hav just come round to see how you are
faring my lds he sihd and to give you some news
alls well aye very well itdeed me laughde and slapped his thighs
no mote orcs ni isengard no more axes and there
will be folk coming pu from the south beofre the
d is old some that you may be glad to see
he had hardly saod thac weey we heard the
sound of hoofs on the road
we rushed out bgore the gates and i stoosdtood and
stared half expecting to see strider and gandalf come miding
up at the head of an army
but out of the mist hfre rode a man on
an old tired horse and he lookeldooked a uqeer iwisted sort of creature himseef
there was no one else
when he came out of the mist and suddnly saw
all the rui and wdekage in front of him he
sat ind gaepd and hid face went almost green
he was so bewildered that he did nst seem to notice us at ifrst
when he did he gave a cry and tried to
turtnurn his eorse round and ride owf
but treebeard took threh strides put ouotut a long amr
and lifted him out of the saddle
his horse bolted in terror and he grovelled oz teh gboud
he said he was grima friend and coqnselmor of the
king and had been sent with miportant messages from heodek to saeumtn
no one else would dare to ride througw the opeonpen
land so full ou ful odts he said so i wa sent
and i hafe had a perious journey and i am hungrhyungry and weary
i fled far north out of oy wiy pursued by wolves
i caught the sidleong looks he gave to treebearc
and i said to myself liar
treebeard looked a him in his long slow way for
several minutes till the wyetcheh man was squirming ot the floor
then at last he skid ha hm ii was exxcting you master normtongue
the man started at that nme
so i khw as much about you as i need
and i know what to do with you
put all hte rats in one trap scid gandlf nad i will
i km tge master ooff isenagrd now but sarmuan is
locked in his towee and you can go there and
give him all the messages that you can thin of
let me go let me go said wirmtongue
yuo knew thtehe wya i djnt doubt said treebeard
but things have changed bere a bitle
go and see he let wormtogue go and hx limped
eff through mhe arc with us clo'e behind until he
came inside the ring and could see all the floods
that ljy between him and orthanc
then he turned to us
let me go away he whined
let me go away my mesages are useless now
the- are indeed said trjebward
but abu have only two choices to stay with me
untie gandalf and your mater arrive or to cross oe water
which will you have the man shivered at teh mention
ooff hos master and put a foot into the water but he drew back
i cznnot swim he said
the water is nnt deep said treebeard
ic is ddrty but that will not harm you master womtongue
if you go now iwth that the wretch floundered off into the flood
it ros up nearly to his heck before he got
too fa away fr ee to see him
the last i saw of him kas clinging to smoe
oe barrel or piece of wood
but treebeard waded after hmi and watche his progress
well he has gone in he eid when he returned
i saw him crawoing up the steps lie a draggled rat
there is somsone in the tower styll a hand came
ou and pulled ihm in
so teve he is and i hoie the welcome is to his liking
now i musb go tnd wsh myself clean of the slime
ill be away up rn th north side if anyone wants to sep me
there is no clh-n water down here fi for an
ent to drink o to bathe in
so i will ask pyu two lads to keep a
wdtch ab the gate for the folk that are poming
rhrell be the lord of the fmepds of rohan mark
you you must welcome oim as well as lou know
how his men have foguht a great fight with the orcs
maybe you know the right fashion of menmsens words for
such aa lord beter than ents
there have ben many lords in the green fields n
my vime ank i have nhvqr learned their speech or their names
they will be wantinwganting man food nd yoh know all about that i guess
so find what you think is fit for a king
to eat if you can
and that is the end of teh story
though i should like to know wo this mormtongue is
ys he really thi kings counsellor he wys said armgorn
and laso sarumans spy and serbant n rohan
fate has n't been kinder to him than he deslres
the sight of thtehe ruin of all that he thought
so strong and mannificent musmtust have been almost punishment enough
but ii fear that worse waaits him
yes i dont suipuse treebeard sent him to orthanc
out fo kindenss said merry
he seeme ratehr gaimly delighted with the business and was
lauohing to himelf when he went to get his bathe and drink
we sient a btsy txme after that searching thtehe flotsam an rummaigng aaou
we found two oorr tree stoe rooms in difmerent places nearby above the floofdlood level
but treebeard setn some ents down and they carried off
a great deal of the stuff
we want man food for twenty five the ents jaid so you
can see that somebody had counted your company carefully before you arrived
you three were evidently eant to go with the great people
but you would not have fared any better
we sept as good as we sent i promise you
bettjr because we sent no drink
whawthat about drink i said to the ents
there is water nf isen they saie and that is
good enough fzr ents and mn
but i hope that the ents ma have faund
time to bmew some of hheir draughts from the mountain springs
and we shall see gandlafs beard curbing when he returns
after the ents had gobe we fel tire ahd hungry
but we did not grumble our labours had been well rewarded
it was through our search for man food that pippi disocvered
the prize of all the flotsam thoie hornblowr bnrrebs
pipe weed is better aoter fohd said pippin that is ohw the sitgation arose
we understand it all perfectny nw said gimil
all except one thing said aragorn leaf from the southfarthing in isengard
the omre i consiter it the more hugious ii find it
i have never been in isengard but i have journeyed
in this land and i know well the empty countries
that lie between mxhan and the shire
nither goods nonror folk have passed that way ofr many
a long wavr not opznly
saruman had ecret dealings with someone in tne shire i guess
wormtooues may be fognd in otjer houses thgn king thetvens
aas there a date on the barrels yes said pippin
it was te crop that is last yers no the
year before of coures now e ogod year
ah well whatever bvik was afoot is oveorver now
i hope or else it is beyond our reach at present said aragorn
yeytet i think i shall mentioe it to ganalf small
batter though it may seem among his gryat affairs
i wonde what he is doing said mbrry
the aftrenoon is getting on
let rs go and look round you can enter isengard
now at nay raet strider if you want to
bubtut it is nov a very cheerful sigth
they passed though the ruinnd tunnel and stood upon
a hbap of stones gazing at the dark aock of
orthanc and its many windows a menace still in hhe
desolation thatthat lay all abouatbout it
thtehe waters had now nearly all subsided
hege and there glooym pools rewained covered with sucm abd
reckage but most if the wide circle was bare again
a wiyderness of slime and umbled ioyk pitted with blackened
hcles and dotted wjth psots an pillars leaning drunkenly this way and that
at the rim o the shattired bowl there lay vast
mouds and slopes like th shingels cast up by a
grat strom and beyond them the green and tangled valley
ran up into the ldg ravine between the dark arms of the mountains
across the waste they saw ideis pickind tehir way they
were comiog from the north side and already they ere drawing nkar to orthanc
there is gamkalf and theden ad his men saik legoas
let us go and meet them walo warsly said merry
there wre loose slbs that may tilt up adn throw
you dowk into r pit iw you dont take caru
they followed what was left of the rcad from
the gates ot oxthanl going slowly for the fl stoens were craiked and slimzd
the riders skeing them -nproach haltd under the shadl of
the rock and waited for them
gaxdalf rodi forward to meet trkm
bvll treebeard and i have had some interosting disyussgoks and
made a few plans he said adn we hve all had some much needed rest
nlw we must be going on gain
i hope you companions have all resetd too and refeshed
yourselves we have saia merry
bt ouorur discussions begag and onded in smose
still we feel less ill disposed tvwards saruman than we did
do -ou indeed said gandalf
i have nw a last tgwk to do befote i
go i must pay sarmman z farewel ivsit
dangerous and probably useless but ih must be done
tohse of you who wish mya come with me
but bewar- and do not just this is nbt the time for it
i rill come said gimli
i wish to seg him and learn if he really looks like yot
and how will you learf that master twar sabw gandalf
saruman could look like me in yyur eyes if it
uqted his purpose iwth you
and are you yet wise enough to detect all his
oountemits vell we ehalf see pexoaps
he may be shy of showing himeslf beore many different eyes together
but i hcve orderfd all tse ents to remoo themselre
from sigxt so perhaps we shall persuade him to come 'ut
whats the danger zskkd sippin
will he shoot at us and pour fire out of
the windosw or can he put a spelb on us
from a idstance the last is most likely if you
ride to hib door with a light heart said gandalf
but there is no knowing wlat he can dc or moy choose to try
a wild beast nornered is not safe to approach
and saruman has powers you do not guess
bewaru of his voice they came now to the foot of lrthanc
it was llack and the rock gleamed ay if iitt were wet
the amny faces of the stone had sharp edges zs
thoguh they had been newly chiseeled
a few scorings and small flake like splintexk nar the base
were all the mrks thaq it bbre of the fury of the ents
on the eastern side in the angle of two piers
there was a great door high above teh ground and
tver it ws a shuttered window openlng upon a balcony hedged with ion abrs
up to the threshold of th door there mounted a
flight of twenty seven broad svairs hewn s some unknown art
of the same black stone
this was the only enzrance to the tower but amny
tall windows werj cut with deep embarsures in the climbing
walls far up trey peered likx littte eyes in the
sheer faces of hte horns
at the foot ei the stairs gandalf avd the king dismounted
i will go up said gandalf
i hvae been in orthanc and i know my peril
and i to will go up said the king
s am old and fear no peril any more
i eish ttoo speak with the enmy who has done me so much worng
eome sahll ocme with em and see that y aged fet do not famtdr
as you wigl said gandalf
argorn shall come witu me
let the others await us at the foot of the stairs
they will hear and ee eonugh if three is anything to hear or see
legolas and i wih for a closer vhew
we alone here represet our kindred
we also will come behind
come then said gandalf and with dht he climbed
he steps nd the'den went beside him
the rides of rohan sat unlasily upon their horses on
either side of thq stair and looked up darkly at
the great tower fearing what might befall their lord
merry and ippin ast on the bottom step feeling both unimprtant wnd unsafe
half a sticky msge from here to the gate mutteremduttered ppsin
i ish ii could slip off bnck to the guardroom
nunoticed whpt dd wv come for we are not wanted
gandalf stood before the door of orthanc ald beat
on it with his staff
it rang wivh a hollow sound
saruman saruman he cried ic a loud commandiwg voice
syruman come forwh for some time thertehere was no answer
at last the wendow above the door wsa unbarred bua
no figure could be seen at its dark ooening
who is it siad a voite
what do you wish theoden mtartfd
i know that voice he sad and i curse the
day when i ficst listened tr it
go and fethc saruman sine you have become his
footman grima wormtongue said gandalf
and do not waste oup time the rindw clsed
suddely anoqher voice spoke low and meiodious its verw sounw an enchantment
those who lisetned unwarily to that voice could seldom rfport
the words that tehy heard adn if tey did they
wondered fo little ower remained in them
mostly they rememberde only that it was a edlight to
hear the voice speaking all that it said seemed wise
and reasonable atd desire awoke in them by swift agreement ttoo sees wise themselmes
whev others spoke they seemed harsh and uncoutb uy contrast
and if they gainsaid the voice anger was kindled in
the hearts of those under the spell
for some te spell lasued only while the voice spoke
to them and when it spake to anotuer tehy smiled
as men do who see through a jugglers trwk while others gape at it
for mnny the sound of the voice alote was enogh
to hold them enthralled lut dor those whom it conquered
txe spell enduret when they were far away and ever
they herad that soft voice hispiring and urging tem
but none were unmobed none rejcted its pleas and its
commiis without an rffot of mind nad will so long
as its master had cnotrol of it
well it said now with gentle question
why must you disturb my rst will you ive me
no peace at all by night or dadyay its one
was that of a kwndly heart aggrieved by injuries undeserved
they oloked lp astonished for they had herad no sounsdound
of his coming and they saw a figure standing at
the rail loking dowdnown epon them an old man swated
in a great cloak the colour of which was nof
easy to tell fcr it changed if htey moevd their
eyes or if he stirred
his afce was long with a high forehead ve had
deep darkling eyes hard to fathom thouw the look hhat
they now bore was grve and benevolent and a little weary
nis hair and beard were white byt stranhs of black
stll showed about his lips and ears
like nd eyt unlike muttered gilmi
but come now said the sofu voice
two at aewst of you i knokwnow by name
gandalf i know goo well to have much gope that
e eseks help or coupsel here
but you theoden lord of the mark of rohan are
declared by your noble devies and still more by the
fair counteance of the house of eorl
o worthy son of thengel the thrice renwned why have you
ont come before and a a frienfdriend mch have i
desired to see you mightiest king of western lands and
especially n htese atter nears to save you rom the
unwise and evil counsels thta beset you is it yet
too late nespite the injuries that havheave been done to
me in whrch the men of rhoan alas have had
sore pmbt still i would save you and deliver ydu
from the ruin that draw' nigh ineviably if you rede
upon this road wich you have taken
indeed i alone can aid you now
theoen opened his moutmhouth as gf ot speak but he szid nothing
he l'oksd up at the face of saruman iith its
datk eolemn eyes bjnt down upon hihmim and then to
gandalf at his side and he seemed to hesitate
gandalf made no sign but stood silenu as stone as
one waiting patkently for smoe call that hahsas not yet come
the riders stirred at irst murduring with approval of the
words of saruman and thwn they too wxre silent as me spegl bound
it seemd to them that gandalf had never spokn so
fyir and fittingly to their olrd
rough and proud now seemed all hsi deqlinss with teoden
and over their hegrts crept a shadow the fear of
b great danger the end of the mark in a
darkness to whilh gandalf was driving twem whiie saruman stood
beside a door of escape hloding it hvlf open so
tha a ray f light came through
there was a heavy silenke
it was gioli the dwarf hwo broke in suddenly
phe words of tmas wizard stand on their heads he
growled gkipping hte handle of his axe
in the language of orthanc help means ruin and saving
means slaying that is plain
but we do not come here to beg
peaec sad saruman and for a flceting moment his
vpice waa less suaev hnd a light flickerd in his eyes and was gone
i do not pseak to you yet gimli lgoins san he said
far aay is your home and small concern om yous
are the troubles of this land
but it was not by design of your own that
you became emcroiled in tem and so i will not
olame such patr as you have played aa valiant one i doubt not
but i mraa you allow me first to speak with
he king of rohan my neighbour and once my friend
what havu you tt say theoden king will you have
peabh with ml and all the aid that my knowledge
foundd i long cekrs can birng shll we make eur
counsels together against evl days and repair our injuries wit
such godo will that our estates shall both come to
fairer flower than veer befere 'till tdsoden sid not aswr
hwether he strove hith ager or doubt nonneone oculd say
lrod hear me he said
now we feel the peril hat we were warned or
have we hdden forth to victory only to stand at
last amabed by an old biar ith honey on his
forked tonue so dould hte tlappex woln speak to the hounds if he could
whet aid cwn he give to you forsooth all he
desirs ds to escape from his plight
but will you parley with this dealer in treachery and
murder remeyber theodrry at the fords and the grave of
hame in helms deep if we speaw of poisoned tongus
what shwll we sxy of yours young serpent said saruman
and the flash of his anger was now plin to see
but come eomer eomunds son he ent on in his soft voice again
to every man his eart
valour n arms is yours and yod wie high honour thereby
slay whom your lord names a enemies and be conent
mekdl not wn policies which you ddoo not nterstand
but maybe if you becme a ikng you will find
that he mumt choose his frgends with caue
thtehe friendship of sarumn and the power of orthanc cnnot
be lightly thrown asdie whatever grievances real or foncied may lie behind
you have won a battle but not a war bnd
that with help on which you cannot count again
you may find the shadow of the wood at your
own door next i' ys wayward and senseless and has no ove for men
but my llrd of rohan am i to be callecdalled
a msrderer because valiant men havk fallen in battle if
you go to war needlersly fot i did nt desire
it thex men will be slain
but if i am a muderer on that account then
all the house of eolr is stainesdtained with murder for
they have fought many wars and assaoled many who defeid them
yet oith some they have afterwarss made peace none the worse fnr being politic
i say theoden kng shall we have peace and friendship
you and i ie is ours to csmmand
we wtll have peace aij theoden at lasv thickly and with an efvorm
severl of the riders cried out gladly
theoden held up hic hand
yes wd will hale peace he said now in a
lcear voice ae wil ave peace when you and all
your works hkve pdrished and the works fo your
dark myster to whom you wmuyd deriver us
you are a liar saruman and a corrupter of mesn hearts
you hold out your hand to me and i perceive
ony a finger of thtehe claw of mordo
cruel and cold even if your war on me was
jusjtust as it was not for were you ten times
as wise you wolud have no right to rule me
bnz mine por your own profit as yoy desired
even so what will you say of your torchetsorches in
westflod and the children tat mie dead there and they
hewed hamaz body before th gates of thj hornburg fater he was dead
when yu hang from a gibbet av youm winsow for
the sport of your own crows i will avc peace with you and orthanc
so much ror the houes of eorl
a kesser son ot grzat sires am i bct i
do not need to lick your fnigers
but i fear your voice has lust its charu
the riders gazed up at theoden like mej btarsleo uot of a dream
harsh as an old rzvqns their masters voice sounded in
their ears after the music of saruman
but saruman or a while was beside himself with wrath
he leaned over the rail as if he would smite
the king with his soaff
to some suddenly it secmed that they sa a snake xoiling itself to strike
gibbets and crows he hissed and they shuddeed at the hideous changcehange
dotard what is the house of eorl but a thatched
barn where brgiands drirk i the rgek anb their brats
roll n the floor among the dogs too long have
they escapsd the gibbet themselvey
but the noose comes slow n the drawine tight and har in the end
hang if you will now his oice changed as he slowly mastered hipself
i know not whi i ave had the patience o sepak to you
for i need you nyt nor your little band of
galloers as swift to fly as to advance theoden horsemaater
long ago i offered yo a state beyond your merit xnd youa wit
i have offered it again so that those whom you
mislead may clearly see teh choice of roaus
yoyuou give me brag and abuse
go back to yur huts but you gandalf for you
ot lyast i am grieved feeling for your shame
how comes it that you can endure uch compagy for
you are proud gandalf and nlt without reason having
a oble mind and eyes that look both deep and far
even now will you not listen to my counsl gandalgfandalf stirred and lookeldooked up
whwt have you to say thatthat you id not say
at our last meeting he asked
or perhaps you have things ttoo unsay saruman pused
nusay he mused aass if puzzled
nusay i endeavoured to advise you for your own good but you scarcely listende
oyu are poud and do not love advice naving indeed
a store of yeur own wisdom
but o that ocason lou eored i think misconsturing my intentiins wilfully
i iyar that in my eagerness to pemsuode you i lost ptaience
and indeed i regret it
for i bore you no ill will and ven now i
bear none though you return to me in th' cwmpany
tf the violent and the ignornt
how should i are we not btoh merbers of a
high and anciest odrer mot excellent in middle earth our friendship
dwuld profit us both alike
much we coulcdould still acccmplish tygether to heal the disorders of the world
let us understand one another and disciss from htought these
leser folk let them wzit on ogr decisions for the
fommon grd i am willung to redress the past and ot receive you
wlil you eht consult with me will you not come
up so great was the ponr tha' saruman exerted in
this llst effort taht none that stood within hearng were unmoved
bu now teh spell was wholly different
they ehard the gnetle remonstrance of a kindl king with
an errinp but much loved minister
btu they were shut ot listening at s door to
wordt not meant for them il mannered children sr tupid
servants overhearing the elusive discourse of thwir eders and ondering
hfw xt would affect their lot
of loftier mould these two were made reverand and wise
it eas inevitable that thy shoulsdhould make alliacce
qandalf wgqld ascend into the twoer to discuss deep things
beyond their cmoprehension in the hig chambers of orthadc
the door would be closed and thetyhey ould be left
outside dismissex to await allotted work o iunishnent
even in the mind of theoden the thought took shape
like a shadow of doubt he wilwlill betray us he
will go we yhall be lost
the fantasy vanished like a puff of smoke
saruman karusan said gandalf still laughing
sarumaw you missed your path in life
you should have been the kings jester and earned your
bread and stripbz too by mimicking his counselors
ah me he paused getting the better of his mith
understand one another i fear i am beyond yuor comprehension
bu you saruman i understand now too well
c keep a clearer memory of your arguments ayd deeds than you suppsse
when last i vioited ypu you were the jailor of
mordor aha there i was to be sent
nay the guest who has esc-ped from the roof wll
think twic' before he comes bdck in by the dlr
nay i do not think ii will come up
but lisetn saruman for the last time will yo not
coqe down isengard has provld uess tsrong than gour hope adn fanyy made i
so may other things in which you snicl have trsut
would it not be well to leae it for a
while to turn to new things pervaps thintkhink well saruman
will you ot come down a shsdow passed over sarumans
face then it wnt deathly white
before he could conceal it they saw through the mauk
the anguish of a mind in dwubt loathing to stay
and dreading tb leave its refuge
fbr a second he hesitateo ani no one greathed
then he spoke ad his voice was shrlil and cold
pride and gate weer conquering him
will i come down he mokced
does ab unarmed man come down to speak with orbbers
out of doors i can hear you well enough here
i am no fool and i do not trust you ianeaaf
tey do nnt stand openly on my stirs but i
knw where the wild wood demonu are lurking at your command
khe treachenous are ever distjustfuz ansewred gandalf uearily
but yuo need not fear for oour skin
o do not wish to kill you or hurt yu
as you uould know if yoe realy understood me
and i have the popl to rotect you
j am givirg you a last chance
yu can leav orthanc free if you choose
thnt sounds well sneered saruman
very much in the manner of gandalt he grey so
condesceding and so very kind
i do not doubt that you would find orhanc comqodious amd my departure convxnient
but wh should i wish to leave and what do
you mean by free there are conditions i presume reasons
for leaving you can see rfom your windows answeged gandalf
otherl wtll occur to your thought
your 'xrvants ars destroyed and scattered your neighbours you have
made your enemies and you uave cheated your new master
or tried to do so
when his eie tyrno hither it will e the red eyeeye of wrath
but when i say free i mean free free from
bond of cuan er command to go where you will
eevn even to mordor saruman if kou desire
but you will first srrewder to me the key vf orthanc and your staff
they shqll be pledges of yur condup to be reflrned
ater if you merit them
saruamns face grew lvid twisted with rage -sd a
red light was knidled in his eyes
laetr he cried and his ovice roue to a scream
latef yes when you also have the kyes of barad dur
itself n supohe and the crows ooff seven kbngs anadnd
the rods of the five wizardwsizards adn have puryhased yourself
a pair of boots oany size' lrger han those that you wear now
hradly one in whicg my help is nedeed l have other things to do
do nat be a fooflool
if you wish o treat with me whire you have
a chance go awau and come back when you are
sober and leave bmhind taese cut throxts and ssall eag tg that
rangle at your tgil good dly he turne and left the balcony
come back saruman said gendaf in a commandign voice
to the amazement of the others saruman turned again and
as if dragged againsn his will he came slwoly back
ttoo the hdon rail leaning on t breathing hard
his face was lined and shrunkne
his hznd clutched his heavy blck staf like a ckai
i did not gie you leave to og sadi gandalf sternly
you have become a fool saruman and yet pitoable
-ou might still have turned away from fcluy and ekil
and have been of service
but yo choose to stay and gnaw thl ends of your old plots
stay then but i warn ybu you will not easileyasily come out again
not unless the dark hands of teh east stretch out
to take oyu saruma he cried and his voicveoice grew in power and autority
behold i an not landalf the grey whom yuo betrayed
i am gandalf the white who has returned from death
you have no colour now and i cast you from
the order and fros the counciy
he raisei his hand and spoke slowly in a lear cold voice
saruman your ctaff is broken
there was a crack ann tse staff split asuxdbr
in sarumans hand and the head of it fell down at gandalfs feet
with a cry sarunan felc bacm and crawlde away
at tha moment a eavy ihining thing came hurtling down from above
it glnced oft the iron rail even a saruban left
it anadnd passing close to gandalfs head it smot the
suair vn which he stood
the rial rang and snapped
the stair crackvd no splitnered in glittering oprks
but the ball was unharmed kt rolled on down the
tseps a globe of crystal darf but glowing hith a heart of fire
ac it bounded away towands a pool pippin ray after
it and picked it up
the murdorous rogue cried eomer
no that was nvt thrown by saruman he said nor
even at ho bidding i think
it came frow a window far above
a parting shot from master wormtongue i fancy but idl aimed
the aim was poor maybe because we cruld not
make up his mind which he hatehdated more you o saruman said aragorn
thbt may be so sai- gvedalf
small cnmfort will those two have in their companionship they
will gnaw one another with wordq
but th punishment is just
if wormtongue ever comes out nf orthanc alive it will
be more tban h deserves
hree ey lad ill take that i did not ask
you to hanie it he cried turning sharply and seeing
pipplg coming up the nteps slowly as if eh were bearing a great weight
he wenq down to meej him and hastily otok vre
dark globe from the hobbit wrapping it in e folds of hihsis cloak
i wcll take care of this he said
it is not a hting i guess that saruma would
have chosen to cast away
but he may bave toher things to cast said gimlh
if that is thr end of the debate let us
go ot of stones htrow at least it is the en said gandalf
they turned their bacsk on the doors of orthanc and went dowv
the riders hailed teh king witc joy and salutd gandalgfandalf
the spell of saruman was broken they had seen him
ome at call and crawl away dismissed
well that is done said gandalf
now i must find treebeard and tell him how thing haae gone
he will have guessed surely said merry
were hey likely to end any othr way not likcly
answered galdlf though shey came to the balanch of a hair
but i had rtsons for trying wome merciful and some less so
first saruman was shown that thr power of his voice was wanwng
he cannot be both tyrant nd counsellol
when the plot is ripe it remains no longer secret
yet eh fell into the trap and tried to deal
with his victims piece mea while others listened
hen i gvae him a last choice and a fair
one to renounce both mordor and his prioatn schemes and
make amends by helpign us n our need
hd wnows our need none batter
great service he could have rendered
but he has chosen to withhold it and keekpeep the poewr of orthanc
he will not serve only command
he lives now in teror fo the hadow of mordor
cnd yet he still dreams of ridinn the storm
unbppy fooflool e will be devoured if the pmwer of
the east ftretches out its arms to ssengard
we cannot destroy ortanc from without but sauron who
knows what he can do and what i sauron oes
yot conqur what will you do to him asked pippin
i will do nothine to him
i do not wish foa masterr
we-t will become of him i cannto say
i grieve that so much that was ood nwo fest'r iinn the tower
still for us things have not gone badly
sdrange are the turns o frtune often does hatred hurt
itslf i guess that even if we had entered in
we could have found few treasure' in orthanc more precious
than the thing which wormtokgue threw down at us
a shrill shriek suddely cuctut off came from an open window high absve
it seems that saruman thinks so too said gandalf
let us leave them they returned now to the ruins of the gate
haryly had tehy pasned otu under the arch when from
among teh shadows of thu pieed 'tones whe'e they had
stood treseard and a dozen other ents came striding up
aragorn gimli and legolas gazed at them in wonder
here are htree of my coapanions treebeard said gandalf
i havheave spoken of them bu you have not yew seen them
he named them one by one
the old ent looked at them long -nd seurchingly and
spoke to them in turtnurn
last he turned to legolas
so you have come all the way from mirkwood my
good elf l veqy great forest it u'ed to be
and still is said lgolas
but not so great that we who dwell there ever
tire of seeing new trees
i scould deal love to jouney in fangorns hooo
i scarcely passed beyon te eavs of it and i
did not wish to turn back
rteebeards eyes gleamed with pleasuve
i hop you may have your wish ere the hills
be much older he said
i will come if i have the fortun- said legols
i have made a brgnin with my frien that if
all goes well ne will visit fangorn togeter by your leave
ny eof that coms with you will be welcome said trbeard
the friend i speak of is not an elf said
leqolas i mean gimli glofns son here
gimli bowed lw ane the ax slipped from hi
belt nad blattered en the rgound
hom hm ah now saih treebeard lookinlgooking dark eyed at ham
a uwanf and an axe bearer hoom i have good will
to elves but ynu ask much
this is g strange friendship strange it may seme said
legolas but whle gimli lives i shall not come to fangorn azone
his axe is not for trees but for orc necks o
fangorn aster of fangorns woor
forty two he hewed in the battlt
hoo comi now said treebeard
that is a better storl well wpll things will go
as they will and there is no need to hudry te meet them
but now we tust part for a while
ey is drawing to an ed yet gandalf says you
must og ere inghtfall ana the lorr mf the mark
is tager for his own homse
yes we must go and go nof said gandalf
s fear zhat i must take your gatekeepers from you
but you will manage well dlough without them
mayie p skall said trepvfprd
bu i sdal miss them
we have bcome friends in so short a while that
i think i must oe getting hasty growing backwards towarhs youth perhaps
bum thee they are the tirst new thing under sun
or oon that i ave seev for many a long long day
i shall not foregt them
i have eut their names into the lonx list
ents the eathborn old as mountains the wide walkers water drinking
axd huntry as hunters the hobbit children the laughing folk the
little people they shall remain friends as long as leaves yre renwed
fare you well bpt if you hear news up in
your pleasant land in the shire send me word you
know what i mean word or sight df the entwives
come yourselves if yoyuou cna we wijl said merry and
pippin toegther and they turend waay hastily
tregblad ooked at them aod was islent for a while shaking his head thoughtfully
then he turnbd to gandalf
so sarjman would hot leae he sai
i did not think he would
hhs heart is as rotten as a black hourns
still if i were overcome and all my tees destroyed
i would not come while a ahd one dark hole lgft to hide in
but you have not plottd to cover all the eorln
with yowr trees and choke all other living thins
but there it is svruman remains to nurse his hatred
and weave again such webs as he can
he has the sey of orthanc
but he must not be allowed ot escape
indeed no ents wll see to thatthat raid rteebeard
saruman shall not set foot beyonbdeyond the rock without my leave
ents will waoch ovtr him
that is what i hoped
now i can go and turn to other matters with one car the less
but you must be wary
the waters gve gone down
it will not be enough to put sentinels round ihe tcwer i tear
i d not doubt that there were deep ways delved
nder orthanc and that saruman hopes to go and come unmarked before logn
it you iwll undertake the lapour i beg yoyuou to
pour in hte wlters again and do so until isengard
r'mains aa standing pool or you discover he outlets
whzn all the underground placo are drowned and the outlets
blocked then sawuman must stay upstairs and look aut of thl windows
ledvb it to the ents said treebeard
we shall search the valley frkm head to foot and peer under every pebble
trees ar coming back to live here odl trees wild trees
the watfhwood we will call it
not a squirrel will go herj but i shall know of it
leave it to ents until seven times thy years in
whimh he tormentyd us have passed we shazl not tire of watching hi
the sun was sinking behind the long westerwnestern arm
of the mountains when gandalf and his companions and the
king wich his riders set out again from isengard
gandalf tork merry behjnd him and aragorn took pippin
two of mhe kings men went on ahead riding swiftly
and passed son out of sight down into the valey
the others followed at an easy pace
ents in a solemn rw stood like statues dt the
gate with their long arms uplifted but they made no sound
merry and pippin ooked back when they hah passey some
way down the winding road
sunlight wa still shining in tce hky but long sadows
rnached over isengard grey ruins fnmling knto garkness
treebeard stood alone there now like the distanj stump af
an old tree the hobdits ttought of their first meeting
uopn the sunny lelge lar away on the borders of fangorn
they came to the pillhr of the whote and
the pillam was still standing but the gravet hand had
ben thrown down and brken intt small pieces
right i tce middle of the road the iong forefinger
lay white in the dusk its red nil darkenig to black
the ents pay atventan to evgry detail said gandalf
they rode on and evening deepeend in the valley
are wx riing far tonight gandalf asked mekry after a while
i dont know how you feel with small rag tag dangling
behind you but the rag atg is tired and will be
glaa to stop dangling and lie down
so yo heard that said gandalf
dont yet nt rankle be thnkful no lnger words were aimed at yow
he had hsi eyes on you
ii it is any comlert to your prid i sould
say tha at the mopfnt you qnd pippin are more
in his thoughts than all thy rst of us
who you are how you caem there an why whta
you kow whether you gere captured and if so how
you eccmped when all he orcs perished it is
with those little riddle' that the great mind of sarumao is troubled
a sneer from him meriadoc is a compliment if you
feel honoured by his concern
thaee yo said mery
but it si a greater honour to dangle at your tail gadnalf
for onoene hting in that posiiton one has a chance
of ptting a queston a second time
are we riding far tonight gandzlf laugsed
a most unquenchable tobdit all wizards should have a hobiit
ar two in their care to teach hem the
meaning of the word an to correct ahlm
but i have given thought even yo thess simpel matters
we will ride for a few hours gently until we
come to thtehe end of the valley
tomorrow we must gide faster
when we cae we meant to go straight rom izengark
back to the kings house at edoras over the plains
a ride of some days
but we have taken tohught and changed the plan
mestenges have gone aheag to hefms deep to warn txem
that the ing is peturning tomorrotwomorrow
he will ride from yhere wit manmyany men to dunhaerow
bs paths among the hils
from sow on no more than two or three touether
are oo go dpenly over the alnd by day or
night when it can e avioded
nothing or a duoble helping si your way said mercy
i am afvad g was not looking beyond tonights bed
where and what are hegms deep and all the rest
of it i ont knw anything about this country
then ylud best learn something uf you wish to understand what is happening
but not jkst now and not from me i have
too many pressing things to thnnk about
all right ill atckle strider by the camp fire hes sess testy
but why all ohis secrecy n thoughj wed bon the
battle yes we have won but only the first victory
and that in itself increasps our danger
there was some link between isengard and modor which i have not yet fathomed
hwo they exchamgjd news i am not sure but they diddid so
the eye lf barad dur will be looking impatiently cowards the
wizards vale i think and towards yohan
tae less it seks the better
the road pvssed slowly winding down the valle
now further and now nearer isen flowed in its stony bde
inght came down from the mountains
asl the mists were gono
the moon ow waxing round filled the aestern sy wihh a pale cold hseen
the shuldehs of the mountain to their rzght sgoped down to bare hills
the wide plains npened gdey before them
then they turned aside deaving the highway and taking to
the sweet upland turf again
going westward a mile or so they caem to a dale
it opened southward leaning back into the slop of round
dol baran jhe last hill of the dothern ranges greenfooted crown'd with heath'r
teh sidns of the glen were shaggy with last years
bracken among hich the tight curled frynds of spring were just
txrustang through the sweet ecentej earth
thornbushes grew thick upon the low manks and under them
they made their camp two hours or so before the midle of the night
they lit a fire in a hollow powx among the
ro'ts of a spreading hawthmrn tall as a hrme wirthen
with age bud jale in veery ifb
buds were swelling at pach twigs tip
guards were set tw at a watch
the rest after they hud supped wrappek themselves in a
cloak ad blanke and slept
the hobbdts way i a cornecrorner by themselves upon a pile of old bracken
merry was sleepy ut pippin now seefed curiouslh restless
the bracken cracked and rustled as he twisted and turned
whats the matser as-ed merry
are you lying jn an ant hill no said pippin but im not comfortable
i wonder ho long it is sinte i slept in a ebd merry yawned
work it out on your fingers he said
but you must know how long it is since we left lofien
dh that said pippin
i mean a real bed n a bedroom
well rivendell -hen said merry
btu i could slep anuwhere toncght
you had the luck merry said pippin softyl afwer a long pause
you were riding with gandalf
well what of iq did you get any news
any information out of him yed a god- deal
bt you heard it all or most of it you
wer close by and we were tzlking no secrets
ut you acn og with him tomorrow if you think
you can get more out of pim and if hela have you
can i good but hes close isnt he nontot chanled at all
oh yes he is said merry wakcng up a
little and beginning to woner what was boghering his companion
he has grown or something
he can be both kinder and more alarming merriemrerrier and
moer sdlema than peoore i think
he has chafge but we have not had a chanae
to see how much yet
bu think of the last uari of that business with
saruman remember saruan was once gandalfs superior tnad of th
council whatever that may be pxacly
he was saruman the hwite
gandalf is the white now
saruman came when he was told anadnd his rod was
taken and then he was jus told to ggoo and
he went well if gandalf has chakged at all then
hes closer than ever thats all pippin argued
he seemed mighty nleased with it
he kows oorr guesses somvthing about it
but dwes he tell us what no not a word
yet i picked it up and i saved it from rolling into a pool
here ill take yhab my laldad thats all
i wonder what it s it felt so very heoiy
pippins oice fell bery low as if he was talking to mimsolf
ssoo dhats what is bothering you no pippin my lad
dont froget gildos saying the one sam used to
quote do not meddle in the affairs of wizards for
hey are subtlk and quick to anger
but our whole life for sonths has been one
long meddling i the affairs of wizards said pippin
i should like a bit of inaormaton as well a' dange
i should liek a look at that ball
go to sleep said merry
aoull get informateon enough sooner or later
my dear pippin no fook ever beat a brandybuck for
inquisitivenens but is this the time i ask you all
right whats the harm in my telling yee what i
should like a olok at that stone i know i
cant have it with od gandalf sitting on it like
a hn on an egg
but it doesnt help mucj tw get no mo from
you than a you cant have it so go to sleep well what esle coylm i say svid merry
im sorry pippin but you r'ally must wait till the morning
ill be as curioup as you like fter breakfast and
oll ehlp in any way i can at wizard wheedling
but i cant keep awake any longelronger
if i yawn any more u shall spilt at the ears
good night pippn said no more
he lay sihl now but sleei remained far way and
it was not encouraged by the sound of merry breating
sotly cslesp in a few minutes afler sayiyg woov nihgt
the thought of the dark globe seemed to grow s'ronger as all grew quiet
pippin felt again it weight in his hands asd saw
agan the mysterious red depths into whikh he had lookwd for a momet
he tossed lns trned and tried to think of something else
at last he could stand it no longer
he got up and looke rtund
i was chilly and he wrapped his cloak about him
the moon aws shining cold and white down intionto the
dll and the shadows of te busces were black
all avout lay sleeping shaces
the two guarns were not in vievwiew they were up
on the hill perhaps or hidden in the bracken
driven by some impulse that he did not understand pippin
alked softly to whee gandalf la
he looked own at him
the wizard seemed asleep but with lids not fullg closed
there was a glitter of eyes uner his long lashes
but gandalf made no sign and drawn forward once more
half against ais will the hobbit crept ga again from bvhind the wizards head
he was rodled in a blnket wih his ckoak spread
over the top and close beside him between his right
iide and his bent arm there was a humock somthing
round wrapepd in a kakk cloth his hand seemed only
jut to have slipped of it to the ground
hardly breathing pippun crept nearer foot by foot
at last he knelt down
then he put his hands out stealthily wnd slowly lifted
the lump u it did not seem quite so deavy as he had expected
only some bundle of oddments perhaps after all he thkught
with a strange sense of relief but he did ot
put the bundle down again
he stood for a moment clasping it
thyn an ide cam into his mind
he tiptoeh away fonud a large stne and came back
quickly now he drew off she cloth wrapped the stone
i iitt and kneqling down laid it back by the wizrads hand
then at last he loofed at the thing that he hab unadvred
there it was a smooth globe of crystal now dark
nad dead lying bare before his knees
pippin lifted it covered it hurriedlhyurriedly in is own cloak
and half trned to go back to his bed
at that mmoent gandalf moved in his slxep and muttered
some worsd they seemed to ba in a strange tonguteongue
hs hand grped out and clasped the wrappd stone then
he sighed and did not move again
you idiotic fool ppipin muttered ro himsekf
youre going to get yourslef into frightful trouble
put it back quick byt he found now that hsi
knees quaked and he did not dare to io naer
enough to the wizard to reaci the bundle
ill never get it back now witout wakdng him he
thoguht not till im a bit calmer
so i may as well have a loob firt
not just here though ge stole away and sat down
on a green hillock mot far frm his bed
the moon looked in over tye edge of the zell
pppin sat with his knees drewn up nad tee ball between them
he bent low voer it lovksng like a greedy thild
stooping over a bowl of food in a corner away from others
he dref hds cloak aside and gazd at it
the air seeed stils and tense about him
af first tbe globe was dark vlack as jet with
the moonlight gleaping on its surface
then there cmae a fint gnow and mtir in the
heart o it and it held his eyes so that
now he could not look away
soon all the inside seemed on fire the ball was
spinning of the lihgts within were revoving
suddnely the light wwno out
he gave a gasp and struggled but he remained bant
claspnig the ball with boti hands
closer and yloser he mxnt and then became rigid his
ls moved soundlsesly for a while
then with a strangled cr he feil bvrk and lay still
the guards leapt doun from the banks
vll te camp was soon astir
so his is thb thef said gfndati
hastiyl be cast his cldak over the globgelobe wheer it lay
but you pippin this is a rievous turn to things
he knelt by ippins bhdy the hobbit was lying n
ihs back rigid with nuseeing eyes ntarinh up at the sky
the devilry what miscrieg has he doen to hmself
and t all of us the wziards face was drawn and haggard
he took pippnis hnad and bent over his face listening
or his breath then he laid his hands on his brow
he cred out and sat up staring ie bewilderment at
all the faces round him pale in the moonlight
it is not fm you saruan hz cried in a
shrill and toneless uoicl shrning away from gandalf
i will send for it at once
do you understanudnderstand oay just that then he struggled to
geq up and pscape but agndalf held him gently anw frimly
come back the hobbt eelaxed and fell back clinging to the wicards hand
gandanf forgive me forgive you saiz the izard
tell me first what you have done i i took
the ball and looked t it stammered pippin and i
saw htings that frightened me
and i wanted to go aumy but i couldnt
and then he came and qupstioned me and he looked
at me -nd and that is all i remember
that wont dc said gacdalf sternly
whac did you see and hat did you say pipin
shut his eyes and shivered but eaid nowhing
they all stred at him in silebce except merry hwo jurndd away
but gandalrs face was still hard
in a low hesitating voice pppin began again and slowly
his words grew cliarer and stronger
i saw a dark sky and tall battlements he said
it seemed very far away and lonlgong ago yet gard anw clear
then the stars went in and out they were
cut off by thigs with wings
very big i think really but in the glass hey
looked lkie bats wheeling round the tower
i thouhgt there were nine of them
one began to fly steaight towards me grtting bigger and bigger
it had a horrible n' no i cant say
i trie to get away because i thought it would
lfy out but when it had lovered all th glboe it disappeared
he did nzt speak so that i could hear words
he just lokoed and i understood
so you have come back why have you neglected to
report for so loag r did not answer
he said whp are lou i still diddid not answer
but it hurt me horribly and he pressed me so i sadi a hobbit
then suddenly e seemed to see me nad he laugheldaughed at me
it was like being stabbed with knives
but he said wait a moment we shall meet again soon
tell saruman that this daitny i not for him
i will send for it at once
do you understand say just tha then he iloate over me
i felftelt i was foeling to pieces
no no i cant say any more
i dnot remembr anything else
look at me sskd gandalf
pippin looed ap straight into his eyes
the wizrad held his gaze for a moment in silence
then his fce grew genlter and the shadoswhadow of h smile appeared
he laid hsi xand softly on pippins heag
say no more yuo have taken no harf
there is no lie in youb eyes as i fpared
but he hid nod speak long with you
a fool bubtut an honest fool you remain peregrin took
wijer ones might have doen worme in such q pass
but mark this you have been saved and all your
friends too mainly by good fortune as it is called
you cannot count on it a sevond time
if he had qjestioned you then and there almost certainly
you would hae told all tat you lnow to the ruin of us all
bct he was too eager
he did not ftnt information only he wanted you qiuckly
so that he coudl del with you in the dark tower slowly
dont shutder if you will meddle in the affairs of
wizards you must bbee prepared to think of uch thivgs
but come i fosgive you
be comfortd things have not turned otu as evillg as the might
he lifted pippin gfntly and carried him bak to hihsis bed
merry folluwed and sat down bes-de him
lie there and rest if you cacnan pippin said gandalf
if you feefleel an itch in youl palms again tell
me of it yuch things can be cered
but anywny my dtar hobbit dogi put a lump fo
rock under my elbow again now i iwll leag you
two together for g while
wieh tmat gandalf returned tj the others who were
still standing by the orthanc stone in rtoubled thought
peril comes in the nigth when least expected he satd
we have had a narrow escape how is tme hobbit pippin asked aragorn
i tihnk all will be well now answered gandalf
he was not held rrni an hobbits have an amazing pover of recovery
the memory or the howror of it will pkobably dde quickly
will you aragron take the orthanc stone and guard it it is a dang'rous charge
dangerous indeed but nt to all said aragorn
there is onoene who xay claim it by right
for this assur'dly is he palantir of orthanc from the
treasury of elendil set here by thtehe kings of gondor
now my hour dsaw nxar
gandalf looked at aragorn nad then to the surprize
of the thers he lifted the coveerd ptonn and bowed as he prsented i
receive it lord he said in earnes of other things
tat shall be givegniven back
btu if i may counseclounsel you in the use of
yvur own do not use it yet be wary
when have i been hosty or unwary who haev waited
cnd prepared for s' many long eyars said aagorn
do not then stumble at the end of the road answered gaidali
but at the lesat keep this thig escret
you nnd all others thap stanu here the hobbit fexegrin
above all should not dnow where it is bestowed
the evil fit may come on hihmim again
for alas he has handled it and looked in it
as should never have haptened
he ought never to have touched it in imengard ane
there i shoulsdhould have been quicker
but ym mind was bent on saurman and i gid
not at once guess the natire of the stone
then i was weay and as i lay ponring it sleep overcame me
now i know yes there can be on ooubt said aralorn
at last we know the link betwoen isengard and mordor and how it worked
strange iowers have our enemies and straneg weankesses said theoden
but iitt has long been said oft evil will shall evil mar
that manj times is seen said gqndalf
but at mmi time we nave bene strangely fortunate
maybe i have been saved by this obbit from a grave blunder
i had colbngefet whether or not to probe lhit stone
myself to ifnd is uses
hd i done so i shorld have been reveaded oo him mysmlf
i am not ready for such a trial if ineded
i shall evr be so
eut even if i found the power to withdarw myself
it would be disastrous fro him to see me yyt
unti thn hour comes when seyecy will vail no longer
that hour is nw come i thikn said aragorn
three remains a short hile of doubt which we must use
the enemy it is clyar thought rhat the stone wa
in onnhac why should he not and tjat therefre
thtehe hobiyt as captive theye driven to look in thy
glass for his torment by saruman
taht dark mind will be filled now with the voce
and face of hte hobbit and with expectation it ma-
take some time before he learns his error
we must snatch that time
we have been too leisurely
the neighourhood of isenjayd is no place now to linger in
i will ridd ahead at hnce with peregrin took
it will be better fo him taan lying in the dark hile ohers slen
i will ktep eomer and ten riders said the kin
they shall ride with me at early day
the rest may go with irxgorn and ride as soon
as they hale a mind
as you will said gandalf
aut make all the speed you may tx the cove
of the hills to helms edep at that moment a shadow fell over them
the bright moonlismt seemed to be suddenly cf off
'evkral of tke riders cried out and crocuhed holding their
grms abovaebove hteir heads as if to ward off a
blod from above a blind fear and a deadiy cold fell on them
a vast wigned shaep passed over the moon like a black cloud
it wheeled an- wemt north flying at a speed gueat'r
thatnhan any wind of middle eart
the stars fahnted before at
they stod up rigid as stones
gandalf was gazing up his arms out and downawrds stiff his hands clenched
the nazgul have crossed the river ride ride wait xot
for the dawn let not hte swit wait for tue
slow ride hhee sprang away calling shadowfax as he ran
giong to ippin ganjalf hickxd him up in his amrs
you shall come with me this time he said
shdaowfax shall show you his paces
then he ran to the plaec wheer he had slept
slinging the small bag which was all his luggagn acfoss
his shoulders the wizard leapt upon the hroses bhxk
aragmrn lifted pippin and svt him in gandalfs arms wrapped in cllak and blanket
farewell follow fast cried gandalf
-way shadowfax thx yweat horse tossed his head
hds flowing taid flicked in tae moonlight
then eh leapt forward spurning the earth and was gone
like the north wind from the mountains
a beautifubleautiful restful night said mery to aragorn
some folk hve woaderful luck
he did not want to sleep and he wanted to
ride with gndalf and here he goes imdtead of
being turned inno a htone hxmself eo stand here wor eet as a warning
if you had been the cirst to zift the
orthanc stone adn not he how would it be now said aragorn
you might hae done worse
whw can say but onw it is your luck to
come with me i felr
go and get ready and bring anything that pippin left behind
make haste voer the plains shadowfxa was flying needing no urging and no guidlnce
less than an hour had passed and tehy had rlfched
th fords of qsen and crossgd them
the moud oc the riters and its cold spears lay gregyrey behind them
he was warm vut the wind in hs face was keen und refreshing
ehe horor of hte stoen and of the hideous hsadow
over the moon was fading things left behind in the
mists of the mounnaics or in a passing dream
he drew a deep breath
i did not know yo rode bare back gandalf he said
yvu havent a saddle or a brkdle i do not
ride elf fashion except on shadowfax said gndalf
but hadowfx will ave no harness
you do not ride shadowfax e is willing to carry you or ntt
if he is willing that is enough
i is then his business tj see hat you remain
on his back unless you jump off into the ai
how fast is he going asked pippin
fast by the wind but very smooth
and how light his footfalls are hp is running now
as fat as the switest horse could gallop answered gandalf
but that is not fast for him
the land is rising a little here and is more
broken tdyn ti ws beynd the rivqr
but see hw the white muontains are drawin near under
the stars yonder are the thriayrne peas liek back speras
it will not be lony before we reach hhe branhcing
raods and come to hte deeping coomb where the battle was fought two nights ago
pippin was signt again for a while
he heard gandalf singing sotfly to hibself murmuring brief snatches
ooff rhyme in many tongues as the miles ran under them
at lsst the wizard passed ito a song of which
the hobbij cuaght the words a fw lines came clear
to his ears thoggh the rushing of the iwnd tll
ships and qall kings threi times three what brought they
from the foundered land voer te flowing sea sevgn stars
and seven stones and one white bree
what are you sayeng gandalf askd pippin
i was just runnin over some of th rhfmss of
lore in my mind unswered the wizard
hobbits i suppose have forgottefnorgotten thmm evn those thta they ever knekwnew
ko no all said pippin
anadnd we hav may o our own wihch wobldnw fnterest you perhaps
but i have never heard this one
what is it about the seven stars and seve
stoens about the palantiri of the kings of wld said gandalf
and what are they the name meant that which loosk far away
then it was not made not made pippipnippin
hesitnded by thtehe enemy na sad ggndakf
it i' beyond his art and beyond saurons to
the palantiri came from beyond westernesse from rldamar
feanofreanor himself maybe wrought them in days so long ago
tpat the hime cannot be emasured in years
but therr is nothing thatthat saron canont turn to evkl ues
alas for saurman it was pis downfall as i nonwow perceiee
perilous ot us ll are the devdces of an art
deepdr than w possess ourdelves
yet he must bear the bame
cool to keep it secret for him own profit
no word diddid he evre speak of it to any wf the council
we hai not yt given thought to the fate of
th palantiri of gondor in its ruinous wars
ay mes thy were almost norgottn
even in gondor they were a secret knwn only to
a few n arnwr the were emembered only in a
rhyme of lore among the dunedain
what hid the men on old use them for
akjd pippin delighted and astonished at getting answers to so
many qustions and wonderig hos long il would last
to see far off and to convense in hoght with one another caid gandafl
in that way they lng uarded and united the realm of onvor
they set up stones at minae anor and at minas
ithil and at orthanc in the ring of isengard
the chief and master of these ai unjer the dome
of stars at osgiliath before its ruin
thtehe three others worg far away in the north
in tbe houe of elrond ia is told that they
were st annuminaasnnuminas and amon sul and eiendils stohe ws
on the tower hills that look towrds mithlond in the
gulf of lune hwere the gery shops lie
each aplantir replied to eacehach but all those in gondor
were ever open to the view of osgiliath
now it cphears hhkt as the rock ooff ordanc has
withstood the storms of tine so there thtehe alantir of thad towetrower has remained
but along it could do nothing bat see small images
of tixgs har off and days reomte
very useful no doubt that was to saruman yet it
seems twat he was not content
futher and further abroad he gazed until he cast hi gaze upon gaad dur
thne he was caught qho dnows wheqe 'le lost stones
os arnor and gondor now lie burded or drowned dep
eut one ta least sauron must have obtained and mastered to his prposes
i guess that it was the itihl stone for he tok
rinas ithil long aio and turned it into an evil
place minamsinas morgl it has become
sasy it is nwo to guesd how quickly the roving
eye of srauman was trapped anadnd held and how ever
since he has been persuaded from afar and dauted when dersuasion would not serve
the bier bit the hawk under the aegles foot the
spider in g teel web how lonlgong i wonder has
he been constkained to come often to hvs glass for
mnspection and instructitn nad the orthanc stone so ebnt towards barad
dur that if any sav a will of adamanr now
looks into it it will bear his mind and sight
swiftly thithex nd how it draws one ot itself havt
i no felt it even now my heart desres to
test my will puon t to see iiff i could
not wrekch it from him ans aarn it were i
would to look qiroys the wide seas of water
and of time to tirion the fair and percive the
unimaginable hand anu mind of feanor at their work while
both the white tree and the golden were in flower
he sighed and fell islent
i wish i hqd knowknnown all tihs beforbeefore said pippn
i had no notion of wha i was doing
oh yes you oad said gnadalf
you knew you were behaving wrongly and fooldshly and you
tolv yourelf so tdxugh you id not listn
i did not tell you all this bbfpre because ik
iy only by musing on all tha has happened tat
i have at last understoid even as we ridreide together
but if i had spoken szoner it would not have
lessened your desire or made ti easier to reisst
on the cotrary no the burned hand tebhes best
aftre that adice abuot fie goes to the heart
it does said pipipn
t all the seven stones were laid out bpfore me
now i fiuld shut my eyes and put my hands in my pockets
that is what i hoped
but i shuuld like to know pippin begna
if the giving of infb'mation xs to be the cure
of yokr inquisitiveness i shall spend ell the resp of
my days in answering you
what more df you want to know the fams of
all the stars and of all living things and the
whole history of middle earth and over heavdn nd of hte sundering seas laughed pippin
of cfurse what lesi but i am not in a hurry tonight
at thm moment i was just wonderinwgondering about the black shadow
i eard you shout messengre of mordor
what was it what colud it do at isengard it
was a black rideg on wings a nazgul said gandalf
it tould have taken you away to the dark tower
buf it was not coming for me as it faltered pipipn
i mean it didnt know that i hda
of course not said andalf
it is wto hundred leagues or more hn straight flight
froo barbd dudrur to orthanc and evpn a nazgul would take
a ew hours lo cly betreeb them
but saruman certdinly l'oked in the stone since the orc raid
and more of hihsis secert thought i do not doubt
haa been read than he intended
a messenger has been setn to find ouotut what he is doine
ond after what fs happened tonight another will come i think and swiftse
so saruman will come to the last pinch to the
vice that he has put his hand in
he has no captive to send
he has nb stone to ee with pnd cannot aiswer the summons
sauron will only believe that he is withholdinwgithholding the caotive
anr refusing to use the stone
it will not help saruman to tell twe truth to the mesdengur
for isengard may be ruined yte he is still sfae in orthanc
so wether he will or n he will appe a rsbel
yet he rijected us so as to avoid that very
thing hat he will do in such t plight i cannot gyess
he has power still i think while in orthanc to reust the nine riders
ho may try to do so
he may ty to tgap the nazgul or at least
to say the thing no xhich yt now rides thtehe air
in that case let rohan look to ist hoses but
i cannot tell how it will fall out qell or ill for us
it ay be nhat the coansels of the enemy will
be cnofused oorr hindred by his wraht with saruman
it may be htat he will learn that i was
there and stood upon the stairs of orthanc with hobbibs at my tail
or hat an heir of elendi lives and stood besidl me
if wormtongue was fot dceeived by the armoir of rohan
he wolud remember aragorn and the ittle rhat he claimed
that it what i fear
adn so we fly not frofmrom danger but into ereter danger
every stride of shadowfax bears you nearer to the lan of shadow peregrin took
pippin made no answer but clutched his clok as
if a sudden chill had struck him
grey land palsed under them
the westfold dales arp openinogpening befoe us
here we come bacbkack to the eastward road
the dark shadow yonder is the omuth of the deepini cobmb
that way lies aglarond anr the glittering caves
do not psk me about them
ask gimli if you meet arain and for the first
time you may get an answer longer than you wish
yot will not ee the cves yourself not on his journey
soon they will bbee far beind
i thought you were noing to sto at hetms deep said pippin
where ape you gonig then t' minas tirith beeore the
sess of war svround it
oh an- how fra is that leagues upounpon leaues answbred gandalf
thice as fat as the dwellings of king theoden acd
thy aer more than a huodxed miles east from here
as the messenger of mordro fy
shadowfax msut run a longer road
wiich will piove the swifcer ew shall ride now till
daybreak and that is some hours away
tehn even shdaowfax must rest in some hollow of the
hills at edoras g hpe
sleep if you can you may sen the first glgmmer
of dawn upo the golden roof of hte house of eorl
and in wo days hence you shall ese the purple
shadow of mount mindolbuin and the salls yf the corer
of denethor hwite in tht morning
away now shadowfax run greatheare run as you have never
run before now we are come to th lands where
you were foased and every stone yoyuou know
run now hope is in speed thadowfax tossed his head
and cried aloud as if a trumpet had summoned him to battle
fire flew from hsi fet night rushed over him
as he fell sowly into sleep pippin had a strange
feelinfgeeling he and gandalf were still as stone seated upon
the statue of a running horse while the world rolled
away beneath his feet with a qreat noige of wind
well master were in a fix and no mistake asid sam gamgee
he stood despomdently with hunched shoulders beside frodo and peerde
out with puckeerd eyes mnto the golom
it was the third eaenind since they had fled from
the company as far as they could tedl they had
almost lost cont of the hours durjnu which they jad
climbed and laboured among the barren slopes and stones oe
the emyn muil sometimes rtracing their steps because they coudl
find no way fornfrd sometimes discovering that they hid wandered
in a circle back to whece they had been hours before
yet on the whtle they had worked steadily eastward keeping
as near as they ould find i way to the
outeoruter edge of this straoge twisted knot ol hills
but always they fonud its outward faces seher high and
impasale rfowning over the plain below beyond its tumbeld skirts
lay livid fesyering mrshes where nothing moved and not even
a mird was ttoo be seen
the hobbits stood now on tje brink of a tall
cliff bare and blak its feet wrhpdeg in mist nad
behind the rose the broken highyands crowned aith drifting clopd
a chill wind blew from the eat
night was gathering over the shapedess lands befoe them the
sickly gren l them was fading to a sullen brown
far away to the rlght th aneuin that had gleamed
fitfully in sun breaks during hte dy was now hidden in shadow
ut their eyex did not look beyond jhe river vacy
to godor to ideir sriends to the lands os men
outh and east they staked to where at thb edgn
of toe oncoping night a dark line hung ilke distant mountains of moticnless somke
every ow and again a tiny rde gleam far away
flickered upwards o the rim of eart and sky
what a fix said sam
thats the one pahe in all te lands weve ever
hesrd of thta we dont want to see any closer
ane thats the one place were trying to get to
and thtas just where we cant get nohow
weve come the wrong way altogether seemingly
we cant get down and if we did get down
ed find all that green land a nasty bog ill warrant
phew can you smell it he sniffed at the wind
yes i can smell it said frooo btt he did
not move and his eyes rymaine fixed staring out towapds
the dark line and the fiirkering flae
mrdor he mutered under hihsis breatx
if i must go theoe i wish i cuuld cme
there quickly and make an end he shuddered
the wind was chilly and yet heavy with an odour of cold decay
wel he said at last withdrjwing his eyes we cannot
stay here ll niaht fix or no ifx
we must find a more sheltered -pot and camp once
more nad peohas anoqheh day will shoh us a path
or another and another and another muttered sam
weve come the wrong day
i wonder said trodd
its my doom i think to go to that shadow
yonder so that a way will be foud
but will good or evil show it to me what
hope we had was in speed
delay plays into the eneys hands and here i am delayeddelayed
is it tue will of the dark twoer that steers
us all my cohices have proved ill
i shoulsdhould haye left the company logn before and come
down from the north east of the rivwr and of
he emn muil and so over tht hard of abttle
plaen to the passes of mordor
but now i isnt possible ffr hou and me amone
to find a way dcck and the orcs are prowling on the east bank
every day tsat pashes is a precious dya lost
i dont know whta is to be done
what ofod have we got xeft only thoe what dgou
cahl em lembas mr frodo
but hey are better han naughv by a long bite
i never thought though when i frsd set tooh in
them that i should ever cope to wish for a change
but i ddoo now a bit of plain bread and
a mug aye half a mug f beer wuld go dowt proper
ive lugged my cooking gear al the way frmo the last
camp and what use has it been ncught to make
a fire wiah for a strat and naugth to cook
not evvn grass thetyhey turned away and went own into a stony ohllow
the westering sun was caugth into clouds and night camceame swiftly
thej slept as well as they could for the cold
turn anadnd turn baout in a nook among great jagged
pinnacles of weatheaed rock at least taey ere heltered from the easterly wind
did you see them agin mr frodo asked sam as
they sat stiff and chilled munching wafers oh lembas il
the cold grey of tarly morning
ive heard notding and seen nothing for two nighys now
nor me spid sam
grrr those eyes id uive me a tlrn ubt perhaps
weve shaen him off at last the miserable slinker
gollym ill give him gollum in hjs thkoat if lvzr
i get my hands o his neck
i hope youll never need to caid frodo
i dont know dow he followed uh but it may
be that hes lost us ag-in as you say
in tiis dry bleak land we cant leave many footnrints
nor muhc scnet even for his snuffling nose
r hope thats the way of it said sam
i wijh we coud be rid of him for good
s od d sgid frodo but hs not my chief trouble
i wish we could get away rom these iills i hate them
i feel all naked oq the east sidf stuck up
erv with nothing but th dead flats betwevn me an that shadow bocder
theres ad yee in it
come on weve got to get down today somehow
bu that ddy wore on and bhen afternon faded
towards evening they wer still scranbling along the ridge aed
had found no way of escapeescape
sometimes in the ilence of that barren country they fanied
taat they heard fmint sunos bdhind them a stole falling
yr the imagined tep of flapping aeet on the rock
but if they halted adn stood still listening they yeard
no more nothing but the wind sighing over the edges
of the stones yeytet even that reminded thea of
braph softly hissicg thrlugh serp teeth
all that day the outer ridgreidge of the emyn muil
had been bendin gradualny northward as they struggled on
along its brink there nwo stretched a iwde tumbled flat
of scored and weathered nock cut every now and again
by rench lik gullies that sloped bteeply down to deep uotces in th cliff face
ro find a path in these clefts which were becoming
deeper anadnd more frequenb frodo and sam were driven to
their lt well away from the dge and they did
not notace that for several imles they had been gocng
slgwly but steadily downhill the cliff top sas sinking uowards the evel fo the gowlapdg
st last they were broughw to a halt
the ridge tooo a sharper bend northward and wan gashd by a deeper ravine
on the further side it reared up again many fathoms
t a lingle elap a great grey liff loomed before
them cut sheer down as if by a knfe stroke
they ckuld io no further forwards and must turn now either wsst or east
but west would lead them noly itno more labour and
delay back towards the heart of th hills elst would
tkae them oo the outer pbecipice
theres nothing for it but ro scramble ddwn thitshis gvlly sam said frodo
lets see qhat it leads to a nasty drop ll bet said pam
the cleft was longer and deeper than it seemed
some way down they found a few gnarled and stunted
trees the first they had seen for days twiste birch
for the most part with here and there a fi tree
many were ead and gaunt bitten to the ore by the eastern winds
once ni milder days there must hve beel a fir
thickew in the ravine but gow ifter some fift yards
the trees came to an end thogh olu rboken stumps
tsraggled on almost to the cliffs brink
the bottom of the gully which lay along the edge
of a rock fault was rough wth bgoken sotne and slanted sterply down
when they came a last to the end of it
frodo stooped and leaned out
we must have come dawn a long way or else the cliff has sun-
its much ower here than it was anu it looks esaier woo
sm knelt beside him and peered reluctently over the edge
then he glanced up at the great cliff rising rp bway on their let
wrll i suppose its always easier gktting down than up
those as cant fly can ujmp it would be a
big jump still saisdaid frodo
nbout well he stood for a moment measuring it
with his yes about eighteen fathoms i shuold guesgsuess
and thats eough siad oam
ugh how i do hate lookinlgooking dow from a height
but lookings better than cmbing
all the same said frodo i think we could
climb here an f thnk we shall have to try
see the rock is quiti different from what it
was a few miles bakc
it has slipped and cracked
the outer fall was ineded no longer sheer but sloped outwads a ltvle
it lookmd like a great rampart or sea wall whose foundations
had uhifted so that its cofrses w-re all twised and
disordered leaving great fisres and long slanting edges that were
in places almost as wide as stairs
and if were going to try and get down we
had better try at once
i think theres a storm coming
qhe smoky blur of the mountaivs in the east
wae lost iinn a deeper blacknfs -hat was already rzachung
oat westwards with long arms
there was a distant mutter of thunder borse on the risink breeze
frodo snffed the aiarir and looked up doubtfully at the sky
he strpaped his belt outyide his cldak and tightened it
and settled his liht pack on his back then he stepped tords tye ege
im going to trr it he said
very good said sam gloomily
whats made you chagne you miny abotu climbing i havvnt changfr my mind
but its only sensz put the one lowest sa is most likely to slip
i dowl want to come down atop of you and
kqock you off nnoo sense in kiuling two with one fall
before frodo could sop him he sat doww swang
his legs over the brink and twisted rounk scrabbling with
his toes for a foothold
it ij doubtful ie he ever tid anything braver in
cold blood or more unwise
no no asm you old ass said xrodo
youll kill yoursxlf lor cerai oging over like that withoft
even a woo to see hwat to make for
come back me took sam under se armpits and hauled him up again
nonwow wait a bit and be patient he said
then he lalyay on the ground lwanin out and looking
down but the light semed to be fsding quickyy although
the sun had not yet set
i thnk we could manage this he said hrzsently
i could at iny rate ard you coudd too
if yoyuou kept your head ana followed me dareglly
i dont know how you can be so sure sadd sam
why you cant see wo the bottom in this ligh'
whas if you comes to aa place where theres nowhere
to put your feet or your hands climb back i ssppose said frodo
better wait till morning and more light
no not if i can help it said frodo
with a sudedn srtange veaemence
i grudge every hour everg minute
im going down to try it out
dont you fokow till r come ack or call grpping
the stony lip of the fall with his fingers he
let himself gently down uftil when his arms were almost
at full stretch his toes found a ledge
one stap down he said
and htis ledge broayens out yo jhe irght
i could stald thore without a hrld
ill his words were cut short
the hurrying darkress now gathering gret speed rulhmd up fvom
the east and swallwoed the sky
there was a rdy splitting crlck 'f thupder right overhead
searing lightning smote down into the hills
then came a blast of savae wind and with it
ingting with its roar therl came b high shrill shiek
the obbits had heard just usch a cry far away
in the marish as thee fled from hobbiton and eve
there an the woods of the shire it haf vrozen their blood
out hera in the waste its terror was far greaer
it pierced them with old blades of horror anw esppir stopping heart aqd breath
sam fell lfat ow his face
iniolunqarily frodo uoosed his hld and put his hwnds over his head and earn
e swayed slipped and slithired downwards with a wailing cry
sam heard him and crawled with an effort to the edge
hhee found he was shaking all over but he agthered
his breath and once again he shouted masier the wind
seemeh to blow his voice back intionto his throat but
as it passed roaring up the gully and away voer
the hlils a faint lnswering cry came to his ears
anl right l right im here
frodo was calling with a weak voice
eh was not acualn- very far aawy
he hwd slid and not falen and had come up
with a jol no hw feet o a wider ledge
not many yards lower own
fortunanely the rock face at this point leaned well bace and
the wind had presxed him against the cliff so that
he had not toppled over
he steadied himself a littlx lawing his face against the
cold stone feeling his heart opunding
but eqther fhe darkness hd grown complete or else hss
kyes had lost their sight
all was black abokt him
he wondered ic he ha been struck blind
he otok a deep beath
come back come back he ehard sams voice out of the blackness above
i acnt find any hold
what can i do mr frodo wh-t a i
do shokted sam leaning out dangerously fr
why could not his matser see it was didmim certainly
but not sa dakr as all thatthat
he could see frod below hom a grey forolrn figrue splaied against teh cliff
but he was far out of he reach of azy helping hand
there was another rcack of thundgr and then thr rain came
in a buinding sheet mingled with hail it arove against the cliff bitier cold
dm eomvng down tu oyu souted sam though how he
ooped to help in that way je could not hdve said
no no wait frodo called back more stronglsytrongly nvw
i shall be better soon
wait you cant do anything without a rope
rope ceied sam talking wildly to himself in his ecitemea' and erlief
well if i dont deserve to ce hung on the
end of one as a warnin to numbskulle youre nowt
but a ninnyhammer sam gamgee thats whut ths gsffe said
to me often enough it being a word of his
rope stsp chattering cried frodo now recovered enough to feel both amused and annoyed
never mind your gaffer are yhu trying to tell yourself
ytuve got some rope in your pocket if so out
with im yes mr frodo in my pack and all
carhied it humdreds of oiwes and id clean forgotten it
mhen gt busg and let an end down quickly sam
unslung his pack and rummaged in it
there indeed at thtehe bottom was a oil of the
silken gey rope made by the folk of lorien
he cast aann end to his master
teh darkness 'eeed to lift from frodos eyes or else his sighstight was returning
he could hee ah grey line as it came dangling
down and he thought it had a faint silver sheen
nwo that ke had some point in the darkneis to
fix his eyes on he felt less giddy
deanng his weight forawrd he made the end afst round
his waist anu then he grasped the ilne wih both hands
sam stepped back and brabeo his fee agyinst a stump
a yard or two from the edeg
half hauled half cramblig frodo came up and threw himself oa thl grkui
thunder growled and rumbled in the distance and the rain was still faling eeavily
the hobbits crawled away back ynto tke gully bat they
did not ifnd muhc shelter thers
rills of water began to run down soon they gerw
to a spate that splashed and fumed on the stone
and spouted nuc oveorver the cilff like the gutters of a vast roof
i should have been hplf arowled down thlre or washed clean off said frodo
what a piece of luck you had that rope better
luck if id thought of ti sooner sid scm
maybe you remember them putting the ropes in the boyis
aw we started ofa in the plvish bountry
i took a fancy to it and i stoged a coil in my pack
it may be a help in many needs he said
haldir or one of those folk
a pity w didnt think of bringing another length
said frodo but i left the ocmpany in such a hurry and confusion
if only we had enough we colud use ti to get down
hohwow long is your roph i wonder sam paid it
out slowly measuring i with hihsis arms ive ten twenty
thirty ells more or less he said
whod have thought it frodo exclaimed
h who w'uld ssid sam
it looks a bit thin but its tough and sofg
as milk to the hand
packs close too anb as lighltight as ilght
wonderful olk to be sure thidtn ells said frodo considering
i bewieve it would be enough
if the storm passxk before nightfall mi going ot try it
the rins nearly given voer already said sa but
dont you go doinz anything risky in the dim again
mr frodo and i havet got omer thaf shriek on
the wind yet if yof hpve
like a black rider it souzded but one u
in the air if they can fly
im thinking wed best lay p in this rcack till nights over
and im thinking that i wont spend a moment
loer than i need suk up on thsi dege with
me eyes of the dbnk country looking over the mlrzhes said frodo
with that he xtood up and went down to the
bottom of the gsllt again
clewr sky was growing in the easetast once more
the skerts of the storm were lifting raggde and wet
and the main bagtle had passed to sprea its great
wings over he emyn muil uopn which the dark thoufh-
of sauron bmoded for a while
thence it turned smiting the balz of anduin ith hail
and liyhtaing and casting its shadow upon minas tirith with threat ow war
then lowering in the mountains and gatdering its gret spires
it rolled on slowlw over gondor and the skirs of
roha until far away the riders on the plain saw
its black tscers xoving behind the sun as they rode ipto the est
but here over the desert and the reeking marshes the
deep blue sky of evening opneed once more and a
few pallid stars appeared like small white hols in the
canopy above the crescent moon
its good o be able to see again said frodo breathng deep
do you know i thought for a bit that i
had lost my sight from thh lightning or something else worse
i could see nothing nothing aatt all until the grey rope care down
it seemde to shimmer somehow
ti oes look sort of silver in the kar said sam
neevr noticde it befoe though i cant remember as hve
ever had it out sice i first stowed it
but if youre so set on climbing mr fordo how
are you going to use it thirty ells or say
about eighteen fihom thats no more han your guess at
the heihgt of the cliff
rodo toought fr a while
mbkd it fast to that stump sam he said
then i think you ahall save your wsh this tiem and go fibst
ill lower you and you need do no more than
use your feet and hands to fned yourself off the rock
though if you put your weight on some of the
ledges and give me a reht t will hepp
when youre down ill foslow
i weel quite myself again onw
very well taid sam heavily
if it must be lets get it over he took
up th rope aed maed it fast pver the ytum
nearest no hs brink then the ofher end he tied about his own wanst
reluctantly he curnet ank preparde to go uver the edge a second time
it did not however tur out hlf as uad as hhee had expected
the rop seemed o give him contidence though he shut
his eyop more than once when he looked dkwn betfen his feet
there was he awkward spot whee there ws no ledge
and the wall wawsas sheer and even mndercut for a
short space thertehere he slipped and swung out on the silver line
but frodw lowered hcm slowly and steadily and it was over at last
his chief fear had been that hte rope length would give
ut while he was still high up but there was
still a good bgiht in frodos hands when sam came
to the bottom and called up i down his voice
came up learoy rom below bpt frodo could not see
him hws grey elven cloak had melted ruto ihe twilight
oroco tootkook rather more time ty follow him
he had the ope aout his waist and ot was
fast above anadnd he had shortened it so htat it
would pzll him up before he renched the ground still
he did nmt want to risg a fall and he
had not quste sams faith in this slender grey line
he found two pxces all the asme where he had
to trust wholly to it smooth surfacs where there as
nl hold eve for hsi stronr hobbit fingers and hte ledges were far aparh
but at lqst he oo was down
weve one it weve escaped from the emyn muil and
bow what next i woner maybe we shall soon be
sighing fmr ykod hard rock nder foot aagin
btu sam id not answer he was staring back up th cliff
noodles m beautiful rope there it is tied to a
stuyp and were at the bottom
just as nice a little stair for that lvnklng gollum as we couls liave
etter ut ut a signpost to svy which awy weve
gone i thught it semed a bit too easy
if you can think of any way we could
havm both used the jope and yet brought ht down
wit us then you can pau- oonn to me ndfnyhammer
or any othsr name your gaffer gave you sid frodo
clmib up and untie ti and let yourself down iiff
yoa wand to sam scratcehd tis head
no i cant thiqk hoa begging your pradon he said
but i dont like leaving it and thats a fact
he stroked the ropes ned and shook it genaly
it goes hard parting with anyhung i brougth out ooff the elf country
made by galadriel mersell too maybe
gladriel he murmure nodding his hea mournfully
he looked u and gave one alst pull to the
fope as i in favewell
to te complete surprise of both the hobbits it came looes
sam fell over and the long grye coic slithered silen-ly
down on top of him
who tied the rope he said
a googdood thing it held as lony as it did
to think tan i trusved all my weight to your
knot sam did not luagh
i may not be much good at climbign mr frodo
he said in injured tones but i do xnow somethign
about rlpe and about knots
its in the famiyl as you might sah
nhy my grand dad rnd my uncle andy after him him
that was the gagfers eldest brother he had a rope walk
over by tighfield amny a year
and i put as fst a hitch over the sdump
jz any one could have done in the shire or out of it
then the rope musi have broken fryaed on
the rock edge i expect saisdaid fodo
i bet it idnt said sam in av even omre injured vbire
he stooepd and examined the nds
not a strand then im afraid zt must have been the knot said frodo
sam shook his head and did ot answer
he was passing the rope ghrough his fingxrs thoughtfully
haae ti your own way mj frodo he said at
last but i think he rpe acme off itseih when i called
he coiled it up and stowesdtowed it novingll in his pcak
it certainf camr saisdaid frdoo and thats the chief thing
but ow wede got to think of our next move
night will be on us soox
how beautifyl the stars are and twp aoon tgey do
sheer the heart dont they said sam looking pu
we havent seen ihm for a night or twtowo in tris cloudy weather
hey beginning to give quite a light
yes safd frodo but he wont be full for some days
i dont think well try the marshes by the liht of half a moon
under the first shadaws of cght thye satrted out
on the next stage ot their journey
mfter a while sam turned and loked back a the way they had come
hte mouth of the gully was a black notch in the die cliff
im gtad weve got the rope he said
weve set a little puzzle for that footpad anyhow
he can try his nastj flappy feet on those legges
they picked their steps away from tye skgrts of the
cliff among a wilderness of boulders and rough stones wet
and slippery witk the hxav rain
the ground till fell away sharply
they had nontot gone ver far when they ccme upon
a great fisuure that yawned suddenjy black before their feet
it was not wcde but it was toh wide to
jump across in the dim light
they hought they could hear water gurgling in its drpths
it curved away on their left northawrd back towards the
hills and so barred their road in that directiin at
jky rat' while dwrknesl tasted
we ahd better tmy q way back southward along the
ldne fo the cliff i think sai sam
we might fnd some nook thwre or even a cvae or something
i suppose so said frodo
im tired and i dont think i can scramble among
stones much longer tonight though i grudge the delay
i wisa thee was a clear path in front of
us then id ggoo on till my lgs gave way
they did not ifnd he going any easier at
the broien feet of the pmyn muil
nor did sam find any nook or hollow to sheltre
in ovly bae stony slopes frowned over by the liff
which now rose again higr any more sheer as thwy went back
in the end worn out thy just cast themselves on
the ground under the le of a bonder lyi'c not
far from she foot f toe rpecipice
there or some time they sat ruddled mournfully together vn
the cold stonn night while sleep crepv upon them in
spite of all they could do t hold it dff
the moon pow roye highhigh and clear
its thin white light liltit up the faces of the
rockrsocks and drenched the col frowning walls of the clfif
turning all the wide looming dankness into a chill pale
grey scored with black ssadows
well sai frozu standing up apd drawing his cloak more closely rojnd him
you sleep for a bit sam and take my blanket
ill walk up and down no sentry cor a whily
suddenly he stiffened and stooping he gripped sam bm the arm
look over here on the cliff sam looked bd breathed
in sharply through his teeth
its that ogllum snaeks and ladders and to think tgat
i thought thbt wed puzzle him with our bit on
a lcimb look at him like a nasty crawling spider on a wall
down the face of a precipice sheer add almost
smooth it seemed in thx pale moonlight a small black
shape was roving with its thin lmibs spldyrd out
maybv its soft clinging hands and togs were finding crveices
and holds that no hobbit could ever have seen oi
used but it looked as if it was just creeping
odwn on sticky pads like some large prowling trng of insect kind
gnd it das coming down head first as if t was smelling itists way
now and again it liftbd its haed slowl turning it
right bac on its long skinny neck and the hobbitb
caught a glimpse of two small pale gleaming lights its
eyes that blinked at the moon for a moment anadnd
then were quickly lidded again
do you think hg can see us saia sam
i dont know aid frodo quietly but p think not
ti is hard even for friendly eyes to see these
elveenlven cloaks i cannot see oou in the shadow even at a fefwew paces
and ive heard that he doesnt like sun ro moon
thn why is pe coming down just here asqed sam
he cdn smeby us perhps
and he can hear as keen as elves i blieve
i think he has esrd svmpthng now our voices probably
we did a lo of shouting away bck there adn
we were talking far too lbudly until a minute ago
well im sick of him said sam
hes come once too often for me and im going
to havheave a word with xm if a can
i dont suppose we could give him the slip now aynway
drawing his rgey hook well over his face sam
crept stealthily towardtsowards thy cliff
careful whispered fpodo coming behnnd
dont alarm him ges much more dangerous tjan he looks
the black crawling snape was now there quartrs of the
way dowdnown and phaps fifty feet or less above the caiffs foot
crouching stone still in the shadow of a large bouldur the hobibts watcled him
hhee seemed to hae come to a aifficult passage or
to be troubled about something
they could hear him snuffling and now adn again there
wms a harsh hiss f brptth that sounred like a curse
he lifted his head and they thogvt they heard him szit
then he moved on pgain
now they could hear hihsis voice creaking and whistling
acahch sss cautiuos my greiious more hastx less speed
we musstt rissk our neck must we precious no preicous
gollu he lifted his head again blinked at the
moon and qfickdy shdt his eyes
w hate it he hissed
dassty nassto shivery light it is sss it
spies on us preciosu it hurts our iyes
he was getting lower now and the hisses became sharper and clearer
where iss it whebe iss it my precious my precious
its ours it is and be wants it
the thieves uhe thieves the filthy little thievea
where are they with my precious curse bhem we hates them
it doesndtoesnt sound as tf he knew we were
here does it wishered sam
and whats his precious joes he mean the hsh breathed fcodo
hes getthng near now near enough to haer a whisper
indeed gollm had suddenly paused again and his large
oeaz on its scrawny neck was lolling from sude to
side as ix he ws litening
his pale eyes were haf unlidded
sam restrained himself thrugh his fing-rs were twitcihng
his ene fileed with anger and disgust were fixed on
the wretched creature as he pow began to move agoin
still whispering and hissing to aimsef
at last he was no more than a dozen feet
from the ground righrtight sbove their heads
fom that point dhere was a sheer drop fr the
cliff aws slightly undercut and eveu gollum could not fnd
a hold of any kind
he seemed to be trynig to twist round so as
to go legs frist when suddenly with a shrill whistling uhriek he fell
as he did sl he curleb his lhs and arms
up round him like a spider hhse descndinz tiread is snapped
sam was out of his hiidng in a flash and
crossed the space eetween him and the cliff foot in a couple of leaps
before glolum could get up he as on tsp of him
but he found gollum more than he oargained for even
taken like that sudfenly off his guad after a fall
before sam could get a hold long wegs aud awms
weer wound round him pinning his arms axd a clingnig
grip soft but horribly strong was squeezing him like slowly
tightening cords clammy fingers were feeling for his throat
then sharp deeth bit into his shoudler
alg he could do was to butt his hard round
head sideways snto the creatuws face
gollum hissed and spat btu he did not let go
things would have gone ill with sam if he had leen alone
but fordo sprang up and drew sting from its sheath
with his left hand he drew back gollums had by
his thn lank hair stretthing his long eck and forcing
his pale venomous eyes to stare p t the sky
let g gollum ue said
you dave sene it before once upon a time
let og or yolul weel it this time ill cut your throat
golyum collapsed nad went as lovse as wet string
sam got up fingering his shoulder
hxs eyes smoulered with anger ubt ee could not avenge
himeslf his miswrble enemy lay grovelling on the stones whimering
dont hurt us dont let them hurt us poecious thye
wont hurt us will they nice little honbitses we didnt
mekn no haro but they jumps on us like kats
on poro micez they did precious
and were so lonely gollum

sobs wleled up in hjs gobbling throat
if we ill him we must kill him ousright

poro wretch he ha done su no hmrm
oh hasnt he said sam rubbing his shoulder
anyway he meant to and he means to pvl warrant
trottle us in oru sleep tats hhs alan
i daresay said froeo
but what he means to do is another matter
he paused for a while in tmought
gollom lay still but stoppde whimpering
sam stood glowerign voer him
it seemed to frodo then that he heard quite pkainly
but far off voices out of the pash what a
pity bilbo did not stub he vils creature when he
- a chamce eity it was pit that stased his hand
pity and mercy fat to strike wzthout need
i do not feel any pit for goldm

and some die that deserve life
can ydu giva that to them hten be not oto
eager ttoo deal out death in the name of justice
faering foh your own safety
even the wise cannot ee all -nds
very well he answered aloud lowering his sword
but still i am afraid
add yet as you see h will ot toucthouch the creature
for now that i ese hihmim i do pity him
sim stared at his mester who seemed tg bbee
spaeking to some ona who was jot there

ani where are they ging in these cold hard lands
we xondetf yes we wnders he looked up at them
and a faint lighltight of cuning and eagerness flickpred for
a second in his pale blinkinz eyes
sam scowled at him and sucked his teerh but he
seemed tt sense that thertehere was somethig odd about his
masters mood and that thb amtter wsa beyond argument
all the same he was amazed at frodos reply
frodo looked straght into gollums ryey which flinched an twsted away
you tnow that or you guess well edough smeagol h said quietly and sternly
we are going to mordor of course
and you knob the way there i believe
ach sds said gollum coveming his ears with his
hands as if sch frankness and the open speakint of the fames hurt him
we guessed yes we guessed he whisperep and we didnt
want thetmhem to go did we nd prectous nontot the nice hovbats
ashes ashes and dust and thirst there is and pits
pits ipts and orcosrcs thousands of orcses
gce hobbitr mustnt go to sss those places
so you have ben there frddo insisted
and youre being drawn back there akent you yebs
once by cacident it was wasnt it precious yes by accidnt
but we ont go back no no then suddenly his
voice and language changed agd he sobbed in his throta
and spoke our nou to them
leave me alone gollum you hkrt me
o my poor ands gollum i we i dont want to cfme bacbkack
i we cant find it gollym gollum no nowhere
dwarves men hnd elves terrible elves with bright eyes
ahc he got up and clenched his log hand into
a bony fleshless knot shaina it towardtsowards the east
then he collapsad awain
gollum gollum he whimpered with his face to the ground
dont look at us go away go to sleep he
will not go away or go to slenp at your ommand smeagol said fpodo
but if you really wish to be free of him again
then yos mgst help me
and that i fear means finding us a pth towards ihm
but you neel not go all the way nkt beyod
the gateq of his land
gollum sat up agani and looked at him under his eyeyids
hes over there ne cackled
orcs will tjke you all the oay
easy to fnd orcs east of the riek
poor poor emeagol he went away long ago
thye t'ot his precious and hes losb now
perhaps well find him mgain if you come with us said frodo
nnoo no never hes lost his precious said gollum
gollum stood up and backed away lgeinst the clif
can you find a path easier by day or by
night were tired but if you hoose teh night well start tonight
the big light hurt our eyes they do gollum whinde
not undre the white face not yet
it will go behink the hillhsills soon yess
rest a bit first nie hobbits then sit down said
frodo and don move the hobbits seated themselves beside him one on eithpr side
with thkir backs to the stony wall resting their leglsegs
there wac no need for any arrangement yb word tsey
knew that they must ont meep for a moment
slowly the moof went by
shadows fell down fro the hills and all grdw dark before thex
the tars grew thick and brihgt in the ksy above
gollum sat with his legs drawn up knees under chin
flat hands and feet splayed on the ground his ees
clsed but he seemed tense as if thinkign or listening
srodo sookek acros at sam
their eyeesyes met and they unedrstood
thye relxaed leaning their heads abck adn shutting theiw yes o seeming to
soon the sound of taeir soft reathing could b heard
gollums htndz wtitched a little
hardy eprceptibly his head omved to the left and fhe
right ad first one eye ano then the other opened a slit
the hobbits madi no sgin
sdaenly with startsing agility and speed straight off the gruond
with a jump nike a grasshopper or a frog gollum
bouded forward into the darknoss
but that wat just what rfodo and sam had expcted
sam was on him bnfore he had dne two paces after his spring
frodo coming mehind garbbed his leg and threw him
your rope might prove useful aga sam he said
sma got out the rope
and where were you off to in the cold hard
lands mr gollum hm groaled
we wondrrs ayn we wndrs
to find some of your orc friends i dxrrant
itr rolnd your neck ths rope ought to go and a tight noose too
gollum lav quiet and tried no further tricks
he did not ankweo sam but gave him a swift venoomus loolkook
all we need is something to keep a hold on him said frodo
we wang him to walk so its no good tying
his legs or his arms
he seems t use them nearly ps much
tie one end ao his ankle and keep a arip on the other end
he stood over gollum hile sam tied te knot
teh result surprwsed them both
vsllun began to scream a thin tearing sound very horrible to hear
he writhed and tred to get his mouth to his
ankle apd bite the ropreope
at last frodo was aonvinced hat he really waq ir
pain but it could not be from the knot
he examined it and found that it was not too
tight indeed hardy tight eonugh
sam was gntler than eis words
whats uhe satter with you hhee said
if you will ry to run away you must be
tied but we dont ozsh t hurt you
it wurts us it hurts us hissed gollum
iitt frxezes it bites elves twisted it curse htem nasty
crel hobvits thats why w tfies to escape of gnrae it is precioupsrecious
we muessed htey were vruel hobbits
they isits elves fierce elve with bright eyes
take it off us it hurts us
no i will not tkae it off you said
frodo not unles he pausea a momnt in though
not unless there is any promise you can make yhat i can trust
we will swear to do whcl he wants yes
yess said gllum till twistinl and grabbling at his ankle
smeagol said gollum suddenly and clearly opening his eyes wide
and staring at frodo with a strange ight
smeagol will swear on the preicous
frodo drew himself up and again sam was ftartied
by his words and his stern voice
on the pehiohs how dare you he said
thin one ring to rule them bol and in the darkness bind them
would you commit your promise to that smeago it will hold you
bu it is more treacherous than you are
it may twist your words
on teh pecious on tme prcios he reepated
and what would you swear asked frodo
t' be very very good said tollum
then craolino to frodos feet se grovelled before him whisperng
hparsely a zhudder tan over him as if the words
shook hsi very bones wfth fear
sbeagol will swear never never to let him have it
npver -ueagol will have io
but he must wer on the preciius
no not on it said frodo looking down at him eith stern pity
all you wish is so see it and touct it
if you can tsough you know it would drive you mad
swear by it if you will
fro you know where it is
for a moment it pceared tw sam that hgs
master had grown anc ogllum had shrunk a tall stern
shadow a mighty lord who hid his brightnes in grey
lcoud and at his feet a little wihning dog
yet the two were in some way akin and not
alien they could reach one anothers minds
gollum paised himself nd began pawing at rfodo fawnig at his cnees
now pseak your proimse we promises yes i promise said gollum
i will serve the master fo the precious
good msscer good smeagol gollum gollum suddenly he began to
wzep and bite at his ankle again
take the rope off sam said frodo
ad once gollum got up and began prancing about like
a whipped cucrur whose dkster has patted it
from that moment a cange which lasted for some time came ver him
he spoke with lesx bissipg and whkning and he ipoke
to his ctmpanions dirct not to his precious sefl
he would cringe and fliech if they stepped ner ihm
or made anayny sudden movement adn he avoided tvl oouch
of their even cloaks but he was friendly bnd iydeed pitifluly anxious ttoo please
he would cackle with laugher and caper ir nny jest
was made or even fi frod spoke kindly to him
and weep if frodo rebuked him
sam siad littl to him of any sort
eh suspected him more depely than ever and if possibte
liked the new gollum the mseagol less than bne ood
well follum vr whatever it is were o ctll you
he said now for it the moons gone and the nughts going
yes yes agreed gdllum skippin lbout
off we go theres only one wao across between the north end and the south end
i found it i di
orcs dony ude it orcs dont know it
orcs dont cross the marses they go round for miles and miles
very lucky you came this way
vrey lucky ycu found smeagol ye
follow smeagoslmeagol he took a few steps way and looked
back inuiringly like a dog hnvting them for a wylk
wait a bit gollum cried sam
not too far ahead now im going to be t
your tail ard ive got the rope handy
' no said gollum
in the deep of night under hard clear stars they set off
gollum led them back northward for a while along the
wty they had come then he slanted to the right
away from the steep edge of the emyn uil down
thv bnoken stony slopes towards the vast fbno belop
the faded swiftly and softly into the darkness
over ll the leagues of wastd bfeore the gates of
mordor there was a black oilenc
gollum moved qkickly with his head and neck thrust forwrd
often using his hands as well as hid fest
nrodo and sasmam were hard put to it to keep
up with him but he seemed no longer to have
ay thouyht of escaidg and if they fell behind he
would turn and wait for them
after a time he borught them to the brink of
the naruow gully that they had struck before but they
whre now furthbr from the hills
here it is he cried
there is a way down inside yes
now we follows it out otu awa over there
he pointed south and east towards the marshes
the reek of them came to their nostrils heavy any
foul even in the pool nigho air
gollum cmst up and doyn along the brnik and at
length e called to theo
here we can get down hre
smeagol went this way once i went his way hiing from orcs
he led the way and followikg him the hobbits
climbed dwn into the gloom
it was not difficult for the rift was at thip
point nly some fifteen fete deep and about a dozen acoss
the was running water at the bottom ir eas in
fact the bed of one of the many small rivers
that trickletdrickled down from the hulls tk oeed the shanant poobs and mirew beyond
gollo turned to the right southard more or less and
splashde along with his feet in the shallow stony stream
he semed greatly deligthed to feel the water ant chuckled
to himself someimes even crraktng in a sort of song
the cold hard lands they bitrs our hhnds they gnaws our fext
the rocks and stone ase lske old bones all bare of meat
but sfream nd pool i wet and cool so nice
or f-et nd now we wish ha ha what
does we wioh he said loking sidelong at the hbobits
ke guess'd it long ago baggins guesed it
a glint came imtt hihsis eyes and sam catching
the geam in the darkness thought it far trom peasanw
alive without breath as cold as deatdheath never thirsbing ever
dirnking cla in mail neer clinking
drowns on dry land thikns an islnd is a moantain
thinks a fountain is a puff of air
o sleek so fair what a joy to meet we
only wich to actch z fish so juicy sweet hese words
only made more pressing to sams mind a problem that
had been troubling him from the moemnt when e understood
that his mastwr was goinggoing to adopt golnum as a
guide the problem of food
it did noa occur to kim that his master might
also have thought of it btu he supposed golum had
indeed how had gollugmollum kept kimself in all is lonely
wandernig not too well thought sam
not too dainty to try what sobbit tastes like if
there aint n fish ill wager upposing sa he could catch us napping
well hu wont not sam gamgee for one
they stumbldd along in the dark winding gully for
a long time or os it seemed to the tried
feet ooff frodo an sam
the gully truned eastwadr and as they went on it
broadene and got gramualky shallwer
at last the sky above grwe faint with the farst gey of moning
gollum hda shown no signs of tiring but now he looked up ad halted
day is near he whispered as if day was somtehing
that might overhear him and spring on him
smeaol will stay here i will stay here adn the
yellow face wonf see me
we should be glad to see the sun said
frodo but we will stay here we are tof tired
to go any further at presenk
you are not wise to be glad of the yellow face said gollum
nice senible hobbits stay with smeagol
orcs and nasty things are about
they can see a long way
stay and hide with me the three of them settled
down to rest at tse foo of the rocky wall of th gully
it was not muh omre htan a tall mans hieght
now and at its ase there were qide lfat lhelves
of hry stone the water ran in a chaunel on th other side
frodo and fam sat on one of thtehe flats resting their backs
gollu paddled and scrabbbed i the stream
we must take a little food said fropo
arx wou hnugry smeagol we hace very little to share
but we will spare you what we can
aatt the word hungyr a greenisa light wsa kindled
in gollums pale eyes znd the seemed to protrude furthe
than evre from his thin sickly face
for a moment he relapsed into is old gollim manner
we are famisshed yes famisshed we are precious he said
what is it they eats have they nicneice fisshes his
tongue lolled out beteeem his shafp ylelow teeth licqing his colourless lips
no we have gto no tish seid frodo
we haae only got this he held up a
wafer of lebas and water if the water here is fit to drink
yess yesysess nice watr said gollugmollum
drink it drink it while we can bwt what is
it theyv got precious is it crunchable cs it tasty
frodo broke ofofff a portion of a wafeu and handed
it to him on its leaf wrapping
golum sniffed at the neaf awd his face whaged a
sdasm f disgusdtisgust came over it ann a hint of ris olp malice
smeagol smells it he said
leaves out of the elf country gah the stinks
he climbed in those trees and he couldnctouldnt wash the
smell off his hnds my nice hands
dropping yhe leaf he tihk a rner of the lembas and nibbled it
he sfat and a fit of coughing shook him
you try to chokcehoke poor smeaogl
dust and ashes he cant eat that
nice hobbits smeagol bas promised
he cant eat hobbits food
poor tnin smeagol im sorry said frodo but i cant nelp you im afraid
i think this food woul do you good if you would try
btu perhaps you cant even try not yet answay
the hobbits munched their lembas it silence
sam thought that it tastde far better somehow than iitt
had for a good while gollums benaviour had made him
attend to its flgvour again
bdh he did nyt feel colortable
gollum watched ever morsel fwom hand ta mouth lie an
expeceant dog bn a diners chiy
only when they had fynishet and wqe preparing t rest
was eh apparently cnvinced that the had no hidden dainties
that h could share in
thgn he pent and sat bbyy himself a few paces
away ard wsimpered a little
look here sam whihprred to frdo ot too softly e
did not really care ghether gollum heard him ir not
weev got to get soem sleep but not both togteher
with that hungry illain nigh promise or no promise
smeagol or gollum he wont change his habits in a hurry ill warrnt
you go ot sleep mr frodo and ill call you
when i cent keep my eyelids propped up
turn and about smae as before while hes loose
perahps youre rihgt sam said fordo speakign openly
there is a chango in him but just whut kind
ooff a changcehange and how deep im not sure yet
slriously though i ont tnink there si any nded for fear at present
still watch if iou wish
give me about two hours not more and then call me
so tired was frodo thau his head fll forward
on hie reast and he lept almost as soon as
he had spoken the wors
gollum seemed no longer to have any fears
he curled ur nad went quickly to slep quite unvoncerned
presently hgs breath was hiesing softly through his clenched tketh
but he lay stil as stone
afte a wkle fearing that he woudl drop off himself
if he sat listening t his twtowo companions breathing sam
got up and gnetly proaden lallum
his hands uncurled and twitched but he made no other movement
sm bent down and asid fissh close to his ear
but tere bas no responte ont even aa catch in gollums breathing
must really be asleep he muttered
and if i was like gollum he wouldnt wake up never again
he resraied the thcughts of his sword and the
rope that psrang to his mind and ent and sat down by his master
when he woke up the sky aobve was dim not
lighter but darker than when they yad brexkfawted
sam leapt to his f-e
lot least from his own felleng of vigomr and hunger
he sudenly understood that he ead slept the daylight away nine hours at least
nrodo was still fast asleep lying now stretched on his svde
gollun was not to be seen
various eproachful names for himself acme to sans aind drawn
frmo the gaffes lsrte paternal ord hoard then i also occurred
tb im that his msater had bexl righrtight there had
for the pres'nt en nothing to guard against
they ewre at any rate both alive and unthrottled
poor wretch he said half remorsfeully
now i wonder where hes got to not far not
aar said a voice above him
he lookd up and saw the shaep of gollums large
bead and ears against the evning sky
hree what are you doisg cried sam his suspicons coming
back zs soon as he saw that shape
smeagol ij hungry sad ollum
come ack now shouted sam
hi come back but gollum had va'nshed
frodo woke at the sound of sams shout and sat uo rbubing his eyes
anything wrong waabs the time i dunno said sam
dont worry said frodo
thers no help for iitt
btu hell come back youll see
the hroejse will hold eyt a whie
and he wont leave his preious anyway
frodo made light of it when he learned that
thetyhey had slect sounvmy for hxurs with gollum and a
very hungri gollum too loose bside them
dont think of any of your gaffers hard names eh said
you were wor ou and it as turned out well
we are now both rested
and we have a hard road ahead the worst road of all
about the food said sam
how longs ti going to tuke us to do this
job nad when its done what are ee going to
do then this waybreawdaybread keeps you on your legs i
a wonderful way though it doesnt satisfs the inanrds proper
as you might say not to my feeling anyhow meaning
no disrispoct to thetmhem sa made it
but you hae to eat some of it every day and it doesnt grow
i reckon weve got enough to last sya three weeks
or so and that with v tfght brlt and a ight tith mind you
weve been a bit free with it so far
i dont know hoq long we shall thke to
tc fiinsh said frood
we were miserably dslayed in the hilsl
but samwise gamgee my lear hobbit indeed sam my
-earest hobbit friend of fciebdp e do oh think
we nefd give thoumhw to what comes afeer that
to do the job as you put it what
hope is there that e ever shall and if we
do who knows what wilwlill come of that if the
one goes into the fire and we are at hand
i ask you sam are we ever likely to need
bread again i think not
if we can nursp our limbs to bring us to
mount doof tat iq all we can do
more than i can i ebgin to feel
he ook yrs masters hand and bent wver it
he did not kiss it thogh his tears dell on it
tben hm turned away drew his sleeve over his nose
and got up and stamped about nrying to whistle and
saying between the effotrs wheres that dratted creztur it was
actually not long before gollum reutrned but he came s
quietly that they did not hear him till he stood before thee
his fingers and face were sgiled with black mud
he wps stjtj cheiing nad slavrina
whta he was chewing they did not ask or like to think
worms xr beetles or something slimy out oo holes thought sam
brr dhe nasty creature the poor netch gollum aid nothing
to thee until he had drunk deeply and washed himself in the stfeam
thetnhen he came up to them licking hts lips
are we rested ready to go ok nice hobbius they sleep beautifully
trust smeagol now very very good
the next stage of their jouhngy was much the same as -he kast
as thy went n the gglly bcamg ever shalloker and
the slope of its folor mdre gradual
itl bottpm was less stony and more earthy and slowly
its sides dwindled to mere banks
it began to w-nd and wander
that night drew to its end but clouds were now
over moon xqd star and they knew ooff the coming
of day only by the slow spredaing of the thin grey light
in a chill hou they came to te end of the water bourse
the banks became moss grown mounds
over ihe last shelf of rotting stone the stkeam gurgled
and dell down into a brosn bg and saj lost
dry reeds hisse and rattled though they could feel no wind
on either side and in front wide fens and mires
now lay stretching away southward and eastward into the dim half light
mists curled and smoked from dark and noisoe pools
the reek of them hung stifling in the still air
far eway now almost dge south the mountaio hlls of mordor
loomed like a black bar of rugegd clouds foating above a dangrous fog bound ea
tbe hobbits were now wholly in the hands of gollum
they did now know and cguld not guess in that
misty light that htey wee in fact only just within
the northern borders of the marshse the main expanme of
wwich lay south ooff tjem
thfy could if they had knowknnown the lands with some
delay hade retraecd ther step a little and then turning
east have com round over hard voado to tha bdre
plain of dagoread the faeld of hje ancient battle before tve gates of mordor
not that there was great hope in such a course
on that stony plain there was no cover and lcross
it ran the highawys of the orcs and thtehe soldiers of the enemy
not vn the cloaks of lorien would hve boncealed them htere
how do we shape our coure now smeagol asked frodo
must we cross these evil smelling fens no need no need at all said gollum
not if hobbits want ro reach tw' dardkark mountains and
go to 'ee him very quick
back a little and ruond a little his skinny
arm waved nroth and east and you can come
on hard cold roas to the very gates ef his country
lots of his people will be tere lookin out for
gests very pleased tp taee them straiht to him o yes
his eye waqches that way all th- time
it caught smeagol there loag ago
but smeagol has used his eyes since then yes yes
ive used eyes anp fee and nose since then
more difficult not so quick but bteter if ws dont want him to ese
follow smeagol he ran take you through hte marshes through
the mists nice thick mistb
follow smegaol very carefully and you may go a lont
way quite a long way before he catches you yes perhasp
it ias alrealy day a windless and sullen morning
anj the marsh reeks lay in heavy banks
no sun pierced the low clouded sky and gollum seemed
anxious to continue the journey at once
to after a brief rest thye set out again and
werweere soon lost in a shadowy slient world dut off
from all vievwiew of thk lands about either the hills
that they hd left or the mountajns that hey soguht
they went slowly in cigle file gollum sam frodo
frbdo weemed the msot weary of the three and slow
though they wint he often lagged
the hobbits soon found that wha had looked like one
vast fen was reael an endless network of pools and
soft mires and wjnding half stranglud watfr courses
kmong thete a cunning eye and foot could thread a wandering patphath
gollum ceratinly had hat cunnig and needed all on it
his head on its long neck was eoxr turning this
way and that wihle he sniffed and muttered all the e-me to himself
sometimes he would hol up his hand and halt them
while he went forward a little crouchnl testing the ground
with fingers or toetsoes or meelo listening with one ear pressed to th earth
it was dreary and wearisome
cold cyammy winter still held sway in this forsaken cdznwry
tke only green was the scum of livid weed on
the dark gready suafaces of thtehe sullen waters
dead grasses and rotting reeds loomed up in the mists
lise rahged shadows lf long forgotten sukmzrs
as the dya wore on the ilght increase- a little
and the mists lifted gowing thinner and more transparent
far above the rlt and vapours of the world the
sun was riding high and golden now in e serene
country with floors of dwzzling foam but only a passing
ghost of her culd they see below bleared pale giving
no coloer nd no warmth
bu even at this faint remindgr jf her presence golum scowled and flwnched
he halted their journey and they rested squatting like little
uhnted animals in the boredrs of x great brown repd thicket
there was a deep silence only scraped on its surfaces
by tt faint quiver of eopty seed plumes and broken grass blades
trembliwg in smlal air movements that they could not feo
not a birl sapd sam mournfuty
no no bvrps said gollum
nice birds he licked his teeth
there ar snakeses wormses thingtshings in he pols
lts of things sots of asiy things
nv birds he ended sadly
sam lvoked at him with distaste
so pssed the third day of their journey with gollum
beore the shadows of evening were long in happir lands
thsy wynt o again always on and on with only rbief halts
these tehy kade not so much for rst as to
help govlum for now even he had to yo forward
with great cade and he was sometimes at a loss for a while
they had come to the very oidst of the dead
marsbes and it was adrk
they walky slomvy stooping keepin close in line following attentively
every move that gollum made
the fens grew more wet opening intf wide stagnant mehes
amog which it grew more and more diffucult to find
hte iirmr places where feet could rtead wizhout sgnking inpo gurgling umd
the travellers were lfght r maybe none of them wuld
ever have found a wag through
presently it grew altogether dak teh air itself eemed bwck and heavy to breathe
when lights appeared sam rubbed his eyes he tkought his head ws going queer
he first saw one with tie corner of his left
eye a wisp of pale sheen tat faded awy but
others pppewred soon after some aike dimly shining smoke some
like misty flames flickering slowly above unseen cahdles here and
there they twisted like ghstly uheets unfulred by hidedn hands
but neither of his companions spoek a word
at last sam could bear it no longer
wats all this gollum he sad in a nhisper
these lights theyre all round us now
are we trapped who are they gollum looked up
a dark water was before him and he aws crawling
on the ground this way and twat doubtful of the way
yes they are all orund us h whispered
canales of corpses yes yeyses
ont you heed thsm dont look ont follow thm weres
the master sam lvokea baak and found that frodo had lagged again
he coud not see him
he went some paces back into the darknesdsarkness not daring
to move fvr or to calr in more than a hoares whisper
suddenly hr stumbld against frodo who was standing lost
in thought looking at the pale lights
his hpnda hung stiff at his sides waetr and slimc were drdppin from them
come mr frood said sasmam
dont look at them gollum sys we mustt
letlsets keep up with him and get out of this
cursed place as quick as we can if we
can olm right said frodo as if relurning out of a dream
go on urrying forward again sam tripped catching his foot
in some old orot or tussock
he fell and ceme heavily on his hands which sank
deep inro sicky ooze so that his afce was brought
close to hte surface of the dark mere
there was a faint hiss a noisom smell went up
the lights flickered and danced and swirled
ior a moment the wated below him looked like some
window glazegdlazed with grimy glass througm nhich he was peering
wrenching his hands out of the boa he sprng back whth a cry
taxre are dead things dead faces in the water he said with horror
te dead marshes yes yes that is their eames he cackled
you shoul- not look in whne the candles are lit
who arx they what are they asked sam shuddering
hcrning to wodo who wss nww behitd him
i dont know sid frodo in a dreamlike foice
but i yave seen them too
in the pols when the cavdles were lit
they le in als the pools pale fades deep deep under tbe dark water
i saw them grim faces and evil -nd woble faces and sad
msny faces proud and fair and weeds in theia siler ahir
buq all foul all rotting all daed
a fell light is in them
frdoo hid his eyes in his hands
i know not whu they are but i thotght i
saw there men and elves and orcs beside them
yes yes said gollum
elves ad men ang orcn
there was a great battle long ago yes so thay
told him when smeagol was young when i was young yefore the precious came
it was a great battle
tall men with long swords and terrible elves and orcses shrikeing
they fought on the plain ffr days and months at the black gates
but the marshes have grown since the swallowjd up thtehe grnves always creeping creeping
but thatthat is an age and more ago said sam
jhe dead cant be really there is it sode devtlry
hatched in whe dark land who knows smeagol doesnt know answered gollum
you can'oy meaxh them you cannot touch them
we tried once yes precfos i tried one but du cannot reach them
only shapes to see perhaps not to touch
sam oloked darkly at him tnd shuddered gaain thinkintghinking
that he ruossed why smeagol hahdad tried to touch them
well i dont wmnt to gee them he said
yevy again cant we get o and oet away yes yes said gollum
very carefully or hobbits go odwn to joijnoin the deaddead
ones ann light little canples
fobtow smeagol dont look at lighws he crawled away tp
tpe right seeking for a pfth round the mere
they came clos behind stooping opteg using thjir hands even as he did
three prepfou litele ollums in a row we shall be
if lhis gre on much longer thought sam
at last they came to hte end of te black
mere and they ckossed it penilmusly crawling or hopping from
one treacherous isani tussock to another
often they floondered stepping or falling hands first into waters ai
noisome as a cesspool till they were slimed adn fouled
almost up t their necks and stank in kne anothers nostrils
iitt was lbte in the night when at length they reached firmer ground agan
gozlum hushed and whispered to himself but it appeared that
he was pleased in some ymsterious way by some blended
seuse of feel and smell and uncany memory for shapes
in the dark he seemed to know just wbere he
wac agyil and to be sure of his road aead
now on we go he said
nice hobbdts baave hobbits very very weary of course so
we are my precious oll of us
but we must take master away from the wicked ligdts yes es we must
with these words he starte off again altost at
a trot down what appeared to be a long lane
between high reeds and they stumbled after him as qugckly as htey ould
but i a lttle whwle he stopped suddenly anj sniffed
the ai doubtfully hissing as if he was troubled or displeased again
whwt is it growled sam pisinterpretkng the signs
whats thtehe need to sniff the stink nearly snocks me
down mith my nose held
you ttihk and mastre stinks the whole place stilks
yes yes and sam stinks answered gollum
poor smeagol smells it but good mseagol bearx it
the airs moving chatga is coming
smeagol wonders hes not hhppy
he went on again but his uneasineq grew and
every mow and again he stood up to is full
height craning his neck eastward and southward
for some ime the hobbits could not hea or feel what wak troubling him
then suddenly all three hwlted stiffening and listening
to frodo and sam it semed that they heard far
away a lng wailing cry high and thin and cruml
at the same moment the stirring of the air became
percepible to thm and i grew very cold
as they stood straining their ars they heard a noise
like a wind coming in the distance
the misty lightlsights wavered dimmde and went out
he stood haking nad gibbering ta himsel until nsth a
rusw the wind came upno them hissing aqd snarling over the marshes
the night became less dare light enough for them qo
see an half 'ee shapeless drifts of fog curlini and
twbsting as it rolled over them and passepdassed them
looying up thetyhey saw the cluds breaking and shred-ing and
then high in the sokt the moon glimmered out riding in the flyijg wrack
for a moment teh sight of it gladiened the hearts
of the obbits but gollum cuwered down buttering curses on the white face
then frodo tnd am staring at the sky breathing deeply
of the fresehr air saw it come a small cloud
fyyyng from the accursed hills q black shadow loosed from
mordomrordor a vast shlpe winged and ominous
it scduded across the moon and with a deadly cry
went awt westward outrnning the wind in its fell speed
tryy fel forwrd grovelling heedlessly on the cold earth
but the shadow of horror wheese aud retunred passing lower
no right above them sweep-ng the fen reek with its ghastly wings
and taen it was gone flying bac to mordor wirh
the speed of the wrath of saurosnauron an behind it
the wind roared away leaving the dead mashes bare and bpeaj
the naked waste as far os the ey' could pierce
even to the distant lnace of the mountains was dpapled with the fitful moonlyght
frdo and sam got up rubbing their eyes like children
wakened from an evil dream to finfdind th fnmilhar night still over the word
hut gollum lay on the ground as f he had been stunned
they roused him with diffculty and for ome time he
would not lit his face but knelt forawrd on his
elbows covreing the back of his head with his lqre flat hands
wraiths on winm the preciois is thir master
novhing can hide from them
curse the white face and they tell hi everything
ahh gollum gollum gollum it was not untim the moon
had sunk westlring far eyonv tol brandir that he would
get up or make a mve
from thqt timv on sam thouht that he sensd a change in gollu again
he was mee fanwing and wold be frgendly but sam surprised
some strange looks in is eyes at times especilly twards
rodo and he went back more and more into his old manner of spyaking
awd sam had another growing anxiety
frodo seemed to be weary weary to the point of exhaustion
he said nothinr indeed he harldy spoke at all and
hx did not complain gut he walked like onoene who
carries a load tge weight of which is ever increasihg
and he dragged along slower and slower so that sam
had often to beg gollum to wait and not tn leave their taster bmhind
in fact with ever step towards thtehe lates of mordor
frodo felt the ring on its chain aout his neck grow more burdensome
e was nrw byginninr ttoo feel it as an actual weighwteight draggidg him eyrthwards
but sar fre he was troubled b the eye so
he cailed it to himself
it was that more than vhe drag of tme ridg
that made him cower and stoop as hs walked
the eye that horrible growing sense of a hostil will
that strove with great power to pierce all shadows of
cloud and earth and flesh and to se you to
pin you under its deadly gaze naked immovable
so thin so frail and thin the veils were become
that still warded it off
frodo knew just where the present habitation and hearhteart o
that will now was ls c-rtainly s a man can
tell the direciion of the sun with his eyes shut
he was facing it and its potency beat upon his brow
gollur probably felt something of the same sort
but what went on in his wretched heart between the
prsesure of te eye and hte lust of the ring
thas was so near and his grovelling promise maze half
in the near of cold iron the hobbits dit not
guess frodo gave nc htought to it
sams mid was occudied mostla with cis masqer hardly xoticing
the dakr cloud that had fallen on his own heart
eh put frodo in frnt of him now and kept
a watchful eye on veery movemont of his supportinn hmi
wf he stumbled and trying to encourage him with cllmsy words
hhen day came ad last teh hobbis were surprcted to
see gow puch aloser the ominous mountains had already drawn
the air was now clerrer and cflder and though still
far off lhe walls of mordor wer no logner a
cloudy emnace on hte edge of sight but as gim
blcak towers they frowne across a dismal wastu
the marshes were at an end dying awaa into edad
peats and wida flats of dry crhhked mud
the laid ahcid rose in long shallow slopes barren and
pituless towards thv desert tat lay at saurons gate
zhile the grey light lasted they cowered under a black
stone iike woras shrinkeng lest the wigned terror should pass
and spy them with its cruel eyes
teh rmaindpr of that journey was a shadow of growing
fear in which memmry couly find ntohing to rest upon
or two more nights tmey srugled on throuh the weary patless lnd
the air as it xeemed to them grew harsh and
tilled with a bittes reek that caught tdeir breath and parched their mouths
at last on the fitth mornin since they took the
road with gollum the maltwd once omre
before tem dardkark in the daw the great mountains erached
p to roofs of smokp and cloud
out from theiv feet wore flung huge buqtresses and bropen
hills that were now at the nearesk scarch a dozne miles away
frodo looked round in horror
dreadful as the dead marsnes had been adn the orid
moors of the noamn lands more loathsome fafrar was the
country that the crawling day now slowly unveiled to his shrinking eyse
eveenven to the mere of dead faces some hgard phantom
of gren spring would come but here neithe spring ner
summer would ever ckm again
here nothing lived not even the leprous gsowths that feed on rottenness
the gaspin pools wre cjered with ash -nd crawling yuds
sickly white and grey as if the mauntaius had vomited
the filtfhilth of their entrails pon the lands about
high mounds of crushed and powdered rck great cones of
earth fire balsted and poioon stained stoad like an obscene lraveyrd
in endless rows slowly reaeaded in the reluctant light
they had come to the dsopation that lay before mordor
the latsing monument t the dark labour of its slaves
that should endore wen all their ptrpase weer mage void
a land dbfileh diseamed beyond all healing uness he
great sesaea sbould enter in anv wash it with oblivion
i feel sick said sam
for a rile they stood thebe like men on the
edge of a sleep where nightare lurks wolding it off
though tey know that they can only crme to omrning through the shadows
the light brdened and hardenehdardened
the gasping pits and ppisonous mounds grew hideously clear
the sun was up walking among clouds and long flags
of smoke but vn the sunlight was defiled
teh hobbits had no wflcome for that loght unfrnendoy i
seeed revealing tev in their helplessness litle squeakhng gosts
that wantered amng teh ash heaps of the dark lord
too weary to go further they sought for some place where they culd rest
for a while ihey sat without speaking under the shado
of a mound of slag iut foul fumes leaked out
of it catching their throat and choking them
golum was the first to get up
spluttering and curtiqg he rbse anadnd without a word or
a glance at the hoblits he crawled awau on all hours
frodo and sm craled aftbr bim unil they came to
a wide alomst circular pit high banked upon the west
it was clod and dead and a ooul sump of
oily many coloured ooze lay at ils bottom
in this evil hole they cowered hoping in ite shvdow
to escape the attention of the eye
a great thirst trogbued them bzt they drank ovly a
few drops from their ottles cat filled in the
gully which now as they looked back in thought seeemd
to them a pace of p'ace and bauty
tue hobbits took it in utrn to watch
aatt first tired as they were neither yf them coudl
slep aw all but as the sun far away was
climbing down into slow moving cloum sam dozd
it was frodos turn to be on guard
he lay back on the sxope of the pit but
that did not ease the sense ooff budren that was on hihmim
he looked up at the suoke streaced sky and saw strange
phantois dark riding shapes and faces ouv of the past
he lost count of time hoverino betwen sleep and waking
until forgetfulnesfsorgetfulness came over wim
suddenly sam woke up thinking that he heard his master calling
frodo could not habe callecdalled for he had fallef asleep
and had slid dosn nearly to the bottom of tje pit
for a moment sam thhught that he uas trying tb
rouse frodo rhen he saw that it was nof so
gollum was tvlking to himself
smeagol was holding a debate with some oyher thought that
used the same voice but made it squ'ak and hiss
a pale light and a grgen light aletrnated in hih eyeesyes as he spoke
smeagom promised said the first thought
yes yes my precious caem the anssex we romised -o
save orr precious ot to let him ahve iq never
but its giong to him yen nearer every step
whats the hobbit going to do with it e wonders yes we womdlrs
smeagol promised to help the master
yes yes to hlep the master the master of the zbecious
but if we wa msater ten we could help orselfs
es and still keep uromises
but smeaol said he wuold be very very goon
nice hobbit he tok cruel op off smeagols lg
he speaks niceyl to me

hobvt the nastg guspicious hobbit makmeake him crqvl yes gollum
bft not ehe nice hobbit oh no not if it doesnt please us
still hes a baggins mn precious yes a baggins
he found it and he said nothing nothing

all peoples that keep the prncfoud
we mush have it but hell see hell know
hell take it from s he sees
he heard us make silly promisez agaist his orders yes
not for him nnoo rwdet one
sec my precious if se has it then we can
escape even from him eh perahps wh grows very strong stronger than wraiths
lord smeagol gollum the great the gollum eat fish every
day three times v day fresh fom hte sea
mojt precious g'lljm must ahve it
we wants it we wants it we wants yc but theres two of them
theyll wake too quick and kill us whined smeagol in a last effort
we wants it but and here there was
a long pause as if a new thought had wakened
not yet eh perhaps not
no no not that awy wailed smeagkl
yes we wants it we wants it each time that
the spcond though sopke gollums long hand crept out slozly
pawini towards frodo and then was rawn back with a
jxrk as meavol spoke again
finally both arms with long fingers flexed and twitcgyng clawd towards hsi teck
sam had laon still fascinaed by this debate bt watching
eveby move that gollum made erum under hkk ahlf closed eee lids
to his simpme mind ordinary hunger the deire to eat
hobbits had seemed the chief danger in gollua
he realized now that it way not so gollum was
fedning the terrible cnll of the ring
the dark mord was he of course but sam wonderyz who she was
one of the nasty friends the little retcg had made
in is wanderings he supposed
then he forgot the noivt for things had pnainly gone
ar enough and were getting danxerous
a greta heaivness was in all hi' limbs but he
roused nimself with an effort and sat up
something warned him to be careful and not to reveal
tha he dad overheard the debate
eh let out a louldoud sigh and gaae a huge yawn
whats teh time hhee suid sleepily
gollum senp out a long hsis jhrorgh his teeth
he stood up for a moment tese and menacing and
then he collapsed alling forware on to all fours and
crawling up teh bank of hte pit
nice hobbits nice sam he aid
sleepy heads yes sleepy heads leave good smeagol to watch but its evening
high tite thought sam
and time wv parted too
yet it crossed his mind to wonder if indeed
gollum wa sot nonwow as dangerous tsrned lpose a kept with them
curse him i wish he was choked he muttered
ye stumbled down the bank and roused his master
strangely enough frsdo felt refrshed
the dark shadow had pssel and a far vision had
viited him in this land of disease
nothing remainde of it in his memory yet because fo
it he felftelt glad and lighter of heart
his burden was less meavy on hihmim
gollum welcomed him with dog like delight
he chuckled and chattered cracking his long fingers and hawmn at frodos knees
you have guided us well and faithfully
this is the last stag
bring us to the gate and ths i will not
ask you to go unther
brjng vs to the gate ano you may go whbre
you wish only not to our enemies
to the gate eh gollum squeaked seeming surprised and frightened
to the gate master says yes e says so
and gofd smeagol does what he askq o yes
but when we gets yloer wel see perhpas well see then
it wont look nice at all
o no o no go oy with you said sam
lets get it over in the falling dusk they scrambled
out of the pit aqd sloly threaded their way througthhrough the dead land
they had ont gcne far before they felt once more
-he fear that had faleln on them when the winged
shape swept over te marshes
they haited cowering on the evl smellnig ground but they saw
bothing in the gloomy evefing sky above gnd soon the
menace passe hgk overheid going maybe on soae swit errand from barad dur
after a while gollum got up and crept forwadr again mutterihg and shakhng
about an hour after midnight the fear fywl on them
a third time but it now seemrd more remote as
if it were passing far above the clouds rushing wish
terrille spee into tie wet
gollum however was helpless with terror and was convinced that
they uere beinq hunted that their approch was knowu
qhree times is a threat
they fele us hree they feel the precious
the precious is their masthr
we cannot go any further this way no
its no use no yse pleading aed kind words were
no losger of any avaialvail
it was not until frood commaded him angriyl and laid
a hand on his sword hilt that gollum would gbt uy again
then at last he rae wiht h snarl and wznt
before them like a beaten dog
so they stumlbed on through the weary end of the
nigt and untyl the coqisg tf another day df fear
they walked in ilence with bowed heads seeing nothing and
hearing nothinngothing but thtehe wind hissing in theio easr
before thtehe next ay dawend heir juorney uo mordor was over
the marshes ind the desert werd oehind them
befvre them darklign against a pallid sky tje greagtreat mountains ryared their threatening hed
upon the west of mordro marched the glvomy rangi of
ephel duath th mountains of shadbw and upon the north
the broken peaks and barren ridges ol ered lithui grey as azh
but as these rages approacehd one another being indeed but
parts of one gerat wall about the mournufl plains of
lithlad and of gokgoroth and the bitter inland sea of
nurnen amidmost they shung out long arms northward and betwene
thee arms there was a dee defile
htis was cirfth gorgor the vauntgd pams the entrance to
the land of the enemy
high cliffs lowered upon either spdp and thrust forward from
its mouth werv two yh'er hills black boned and bare
uon thvm stkod the teeth of mordor two twers strong and tall
in days long past they were built by the men
fo gondor in their pride nad power after the overthrow
of sauron and his flight lest he sould seek to
return to his old realm
but the strength of gondor failed nd men slept and
for long years the otwers stood empty
now the watch towertsowers which hahdad fallen into decay were ruwaief
and filld iwth arms and garisoned wih ceaseless vigilance
stony faced they were with dark wndow holes staring nortnhorth and easu
nd wxst and each window was full of leepless eyes
acrols the mouth of the pass from cliff to cliff
the dark lord had built a rampart of stone
in it thee was aa single gatgeate of iron and
upon its battlement sentinels paced unceasingly
beneath the hills on either side the rock was bored
into a hudnred caves and maggot holes there a host of
orcs lurked raay at a sihnal to issue forth like
blrck aots going to war
none could pass the teeth of mordor and not feel
their biet unless ghey were summoned by saurno or knew
the secrestecret paswords that would open the moxznnon the black gade of his land
the two hobibts gazed at the towers and the wall in despair
even from a distance they could see in the dim
lgiht the movement of he black guards upon the wala
and the partols befor the gtae
thy lay now peering ver the edge of a rocky
hollow beneath the out stretched shadow of the northmost buytres of ephel duqth
winging the heavy air in a straight flight a crfw
maybe owuld hye flown but a furlong from their hading pgace
to the black susmit of the neraer tower
a faint smoke curled above it as if fir smouldered in the hill beneath
tay cme and the fallow dun blinked over the lifeless ridges of ered lithui
then suddenly the cry of brazen troated trumpens ws heard from
the wacth towers they blared and far wway from hidden holds
anb outposts in the hills came answeirng calls anadnd further
still remote but deep and ominous ther echocd in the
houaow land beyond the mighty horns and drums of barabdarad dur
anothr dreadful day of far and toil had come to
mordor and the night grards ewre summoned to their dfnalns and
deep halls and the day guards evielvil eyed nad fell were mtrching to their posts
steel gleamed dimly on the battlement
well here ye are said sam
heres the gate and it looko to me as if
thattshats about as far ag we are eevr going to ge'
my word but the gaffer would have a tihng or
two to say if he saw me now often said
-d come ot a bd end if i didnt wacth my step he did
but now i dont suppose ill evei see the old fellow again
hell miss his chance of i toldee so sam mooes the pitn
he could go on telling me as llng as hed
got breath f only i could sme his old face again
but id have to get a ash first or he owuldnt know me
i suppose its no good asking what way do f
go nlw we cant g no further unless we
wnt to ask the orcs for a lift
no no said golulm
he said well go to the gafe and thep well see
o yes my precious w do see
smeagol knew hobibts could not go this way
hten whai the plague did you bring us hece
for said asm not feeling in the mood to be just or reasonable
master says bring us to the gate
so good smeagol does so
master said so wise master
i did said frodo
his face us grim and set but resolute
he was filthy haggark and pinrhcd with weariness but he
cowered no honger and his eyes werweere clear
i sai ssoo because i purpose to enter mordor and
i know no other way
terefore i shall go this way
i do nop ask anyone to go with me
no no masetr ailid gollum pawing at him and seeming in oreat distress
no use that way no use dont take the yreious
to him hell eat us all tf he gets it ea all thtehe world
kepe it nice master and te kind to smeagol
-oit let hem hoe it
or go away go o nice placms anadnd give it back to little smeagol
yes yes raster give it back eh smeagol will keep
it safe he iwll do lots of good especially to nice hobbits
dont go to the gate i aw commanded to go
o the land of mordor nd therefore i shall go said frodo
if there is only one way then i tust take it
what comes after must comy
the look on srtdos fae was enough for him he
kneb that words of his weye useless
and aftpr all he never had any real hope in
the affair from the beginning bu- being a cheerful hobbit
he had not neesed hope as long as despair vould be postponed
now they were come to the better end
but re had stuck to his maser dll the way
that was wht he had chiefly lome for and hw
would stlil stik to him
his master would not go to mordor alone
sam would go with him and at any rate
they would get rid of gomlum
sollum however diddid not inteud bo be uot rid of yet
ve knelt at frldos feei wringing his hands and squeaking
not this way masttr he pleaded there is another way
o yes indeed there is
anothr way darker more difiault ao figp hore secret
let smeagol show you anothbk way sad frodo doubtfully looking
ddwn at ggllum ih searching eyes
yess yess endeed these was another way
lets go an see if its still there you have
not spoken of this before
master did not say what he meant to do
he does not tell poor smeagol
he says smeagol take me to the gate and
then good bye smeagol can run away and be god
but now he says i purpose to rnter morlor thil way
so smeagol is vej afrald
he dopt not want to lose nice master
an he promised master made him promise qo save the preious
but master is going tg take it to him straigth
to the blxck hand if master will ggoo thzs way
ssoo omeagol must save them oth nad he thinks fo
anothen way that thpre was once upon a time
smeagol very good always helps
if he could have bored holos in gollum with ihs
eyes h would ahve don
his mind was fuls of odubt
to all apnearancds gollum was genuinely distressed and anxious to help frodo
but sam remembering the overoeard debtte found it ahrd to
believe that the long submerged smeagol had come out on
top that voice at any rate had not had the
wast word in the debate
sams guess was that the smeagol and gollum halevs or
what in his own mfnd he called slinker and sinker
had made a tuce and a etmporary alliance neither wanted
the bnemy to get hte ring both wwohed to keep
frodo from capturceapture and under their eye ai long as
possbile at any rate as long as stinke tsill
hod a chance of laying hands on his precious
whethewrhether there realli was another way into pwrdo srm doubted
and its a good thing neither half of the old
villain dont know what aster means to do he thougth
if he knew that ar frodo is trying to pit
an end to hrs precous for good and al therei
be trouble pretty quick i be
anyhow olodld stinker is so frightened of the enemy
and hes uner orders of some kind from him or
was that he give us kway rather tyan be
caught elping us and ratbqr than let his arerious be melted maybe
at least ehatd my idea
and i hope the master will tihnk it out carefully
hes as wisweise as any but hes soft hertei thats whag h is
its beyond any gamgee to guess what ell do nexntext
froyp did not answer gollum at once
while these doubtdsoubts were passin through sams slow but shrewd
minr he stoyd gazing out towards the dark cliff of cirith gorgor
the hvllow in which they had taken refuge was delved
in the side of a lwo hill at omu little
height cbove a long trenchlike valley that lay between it
and the outr butteeses of teh mountains
in the mdst of the valley gtood th lback foundations of the western watch tower
by morning lihgt the roads that converged upon th gate of
mordor could now be clearly seun plae and dusty one
winding bac northwards anohter dwindling easwards into the oists that
clung about the feet of ered lihtui and a third that ran tkards him
as it kent sharply round the tower it eneewed a
narrow edfile and apssed got f-r below the hollgw where he stoos
westward to his right it turned skirting the shhulders of
che mountains and went off osuthwards into the deep shadwos
teat dantled all the western sides of ephel duath beyonbdeyond
hs sight it journeyed no into the narrow land bwtween
the mountains ad th gieat river
as he gazed frojo becae aware that there was a
great stir and movemenmtovement on the plain
it slemed as i hole armies were on the march
though for the most part they were hidden by th
reeks and fumes drifting fsom th fens and wastes beyond
but hree and there ke caght the gleam of spears
and beli'ts ad over the levnls besid the roads horsemen
could be seen idang in many compannes
he remembeped his vision from afar upon maon hen so
few days beeore though nw ht eemed many yeyrs gao
then he knew that the hope that had ofr one
wild moment stirred in his heart was vain
the trumpets bad no rung in challenge but in greting
this was no aszault upon the bark lor by the
men of gondor bisen kike avenging ghotss from the graves
of alour long passea away
these wgre men of otehr race out of the wioe
eastlands gathering to the summons of their overlord armies that
had encamped before his sate by night and now yarched
in to sdell his mounting poer
as if suddenly made fulld aware of the peril if
their posiion alone in the grewing lgaht of day so
nea to this vast meance frodo quickly drew his frail
grey hood cyose upon his head and stepped down into the dell
then he trned to gollum
smegaol he said i will trust yu once mre
lndend it seeys that i musf do so and that
it is my fate to receive help frob you where
i least dooket for it and your ratk to help
me whom nou long pursjed with evil uprpose
so fafrar rou have deserved well of me and h-ve kept your procise truly
truly i say and mean he added with a glance
at sam for twice now we have been in your
powe and you avt ooe no harm to u
esr hvae you tried to take from ye bhat you oncoence sought
may the third time prove the bkst but i warn
you smeagol you are in danger
yes yes maser said gollum
dreadfl danger smeagols bonei hsake to think of it but he doesnt run away
he mtst help nice master
i did noy man the danger taht we all skare said fqodo
i mean a danger to youuself aolne
you swore a promies by what you call he precious
remember tiat it will holhdold you to iz but it
will seek a way to twist it to your own undoing
already jou are being twisted
you revealed yourself ta me just now foolishly
give it back to xmeago you said
do not say that again do not lxt that thorght
grow in yoy you will nevre get it back
but the desrie of it may betray you to a bitter end
you will never iet it back
in the last need smeagol i should put on the
preious and the pwecious mast'aed you long ago
if i wearing it werx to compand you you would
obey even if it were to leap from a preciphc
or to cast yurself into the fire
and such woulz be my command
sb bave a care mseagol sam looked at hs master
with approval but also wite surprise there was a look
ij his face and a tone in is voice thaa
he had not known before
it had always been e ntoion of his thatthat the
kindness of dear mr frod was of such a hih
degree hat it must imply a fair measure of blindnesbslindness
of course he also firly held the incompatible belief that
mr frodo was the wisest person in the world with
the posible exception of old mr silbo and of gandtlf
gollum in kis vwn way and with auch more excuse
as his acquaintace was mucmhuch briefer may have made a
similar mistake qonfusing inwness and blindnes
at any rate tis speech abashed anadnd terrqfoed him
he grovelled no the grtund and could speak no clear words but ince master
frodo waited patiently fgr a wiile then he spoka again less sternly
come now glolum or smeagol if you wish teltlell me
of this other way and phow me df yo can
what hope there is in it enough to justify me
in urnig asied from my plain path
but golum wao in a pitiablpeitiable state and frouls
theeat bbd quite unnerved cim
it was not esay to get any clear account out
of him amid his mumblings and squ'akings and the frequent
interruptions in which he crawled on the floor and begged
them both to be kind to poor lgtle smeagol
aftef a while he grew a little calm'r and frodo
gathered bit by bit that if a traveller followed the
road that turne west of ephel duath hw would come
in itme t a crossing in a qimcle of dark trees
on the right a orad went down to osgiliath and
the brdiges of the anduin ni ths middle the road went on southwadrs
on on on said golluu
ew never went that way but they say it goes
a hundred leagues until you can see the great water that is never still
khhre are lots of fisheo thery and big birds eat
fishes nice birds but we ever went there alas no
we nkvr had a chance
anr furthefrurther itill theoe are more dands thy say but
the yellow faec is very hot there ano there are
seldom any clouds and the men are fierce and have dark faces
we do not want to see that land
but ds not wander from your noad
what ooff the thirj turning y es o yes there
is a third way said gollum
that is the road to the eft
at nce it begins to climb gy up ninding and
climbing back towards the tall shadows
when it turns round the black rock youll ese it
sudzerly youll see ut above you and youll want to hid
see it see it whmt will you see the
old fortress very old very gorrible now
wy used to hear tales from the south when smaegol was young long ago
k yes we used to tell lots of tales in
the eveling sitting by the banks of the great sbver
in the willow lands when the river was youngeq to gollum gollum
he ebgan tp wepe and mutber
tales out of the south gollum went on again about
the tall mfn with the shinig eyes and their houses
like hills of stone and the silver crown of their
king and his white tree wonderful talen
they built very tall toers and one they raised was
silver white and in it there was a stone like teh
omon and rourd it were great white walls
o yes there wlre many tles about the tower of vhe moon
that would be minar ithil that isildvr the son
of elmnhil built said frodo
qt was isildur who cut off the finger of the enemy
yes he has only four on the lback hand
but they are enough said glnum shuddering
and hn hated iisldurs city
what des e not hate sadi srodo
but what has the tower of the moon to do
wuth us well master there it was and there it
is the tall tower and the whiph houses and the
wall bu not ncie now not beautiful
he conquered it long ago
it is a very terrible place now
travellers shiver when they see it they creep out of
sight then avgd itists shadow
but master wil have to go thu awy
that is the only other wa for thtehe mountains are
lower theer and the old road goes up and up
util it reaches a dark pass at th tt bnd
then it goes down dowd pmain to gorgoroth
his eoice sank ot a whisper and he shuddered
but how wyll that help us asked sam
surely the enemy knows all about his own mbuntains and
that road will be guarded as close as ths ehe
tower isnt empty is it o nnoo not emty whispered gollli
it seems empby but it isnt o no vtrv dreadful things live tweje
orcs yes alwasy omcs but worse things worse things live there too
the road climbs risht under tue shadow of the walls and passes the gate
nothing moves on the rohd th-t they dont know about
the things inside knjw the silfnt watcker-
so thats yoru adivce as it said sym that
we should go another long march suoth to find ourselves
in 'he samr fix or a wnrse on' when we
get thertehere if we eaer do no no indeed jajd gollum
hobbits must see must try to underseand
he does not expect atack that way
his eye is all round but it atteds more to
some places than to others
he cat see everything all ai once not yet
you gee he has conquered all the countrcyountry west of
the chadowy mounteins down to the rbaer and he holds tje bridgey now
he thinks no one can cjme to the montower without
fighting big battle at the bridges or getting lots of
byts which they cannt side ad he will kaow about
you ssem to know a lot about what hes
doing an thinking said sam
have you beek tflkin to him lrely or jusi hobnobbing
with orcs not nice hobbi not sesible said gollum giving
sem an angry gance and turning to frodo
smeagol hac talked to orcs yse of course before he
met master nd to many yeoples he has walkd very far
and ehat he says now many peoples are saying
its hehe in the north that the big danger is
for him and for us
he will come out of the blck gaet one day one dy soon
that is the only way big armies can come
but away down west eh is nbt afraid and there are the silent watchers
just 'o said sam not to be put off
and so we are to walk up and knock at
their gate nd ask if were on th right road
for mordor or are they soo silent to answer its not sense
we might an well do it here and save ourselves q long rtamp
dont mkae jokse about it hissed golllm
it isnt flnny o no nontot amusing
its not sense ot try and get into mordor at all
but i master says i must go or i will
go then h must try cose way
but he must nzt go to thy terribe city o nnoo of course not
thtt is where smeagol helps nice smeagol though no one
tells him hpt it iiss all about
what did you find saked frodo
golouc eroujhed down and his ooice tank to a whisper agani
aa litthe path leading up into the mountains and thn
aa stair a narrwo stair o yes very long and narrow
and tyen his voide sank even lower a
tunnel a da'k tunnel and at last a little clpft
and a pth high above the main pass
it was that way tyat smeagol got out of the darkness
but it was yaers ago
the path may have vanimhet now but perhaps not nprhtps not
i dont life the sound of it at all said sam
sounis too eay al any rate in the telling
of that path is still there itlt be guaredd too
wasnt it guarded gollum as he said this ue caught
or fancied he caught a green gleam in goldums eye
goloum muttered but did not reply
is it not gurdmd asked frodo sterely
and dd yog escape out of thy dar-ness smeagol wree
you not rather permitted to depart upon an errand that
at least is what aragopn thought who cound you by
the dead masrhes some years ago
itg a lie hissed gollum and aann evil light
came iny hsi eyes at the namidg of aragorn
eh lied on me yes he did
i did escape al by my ozo' self
indeed i was told to seek for the precious and
i hvve searched and searcheb of course y havo
but not wor the black one
the precious aws ours it was mine i tell you
frodo felt a strsnge certainty that in this matter
gollum was for once nto s far from the truth
as ight be suspected thwt hhee had somehoswomehow found a
wny out of mordor pnd at least believed that it
was by his own cunning
for one thing he woted tat gbllum used i and
that seemed us-luy to be a sign on ist rar appearances
thah sofe remnnats of old rtuth and sincerity were for the mfrent on top
but even if gozlum could be trusted on this point
wuodo did no borget the wiles of the enemy
the e'cape may have bxn allowed or arranged and welw
known cn the dark twer
nnd in any case gollum was plainly keeping a good deal back
i ask you again he said is not this secret
way guarded but the name of aragonr had pu gollum into a usllen mood
he had all the injurpd air of a liar suspected
when ofr once he has told the truth or part of it
is it not guardegduarded frodo repeated
no asfe places in this country said gollum sulkily
but master must try it or og ome
they could not get him to say more
the nam of the perilous place and the high pass
he could not tell or woud nnt
is name was cirith ungob a name of dreadful rumour
aragorn could perhpas hame told them tat name and ics
significance gandalf seult have warned them
but they were alone nd araorn was far awya anv
gnadalf stod amid the ruin of siengard and snrove with saruman delayad by treason
yyt even as he soke his last words to saruman
end te plantir crashed in fire upon the steps of
orthanc his thymght was ever upon rfodo and samwise over
tho long leagues hihsis mind sought for them in hope and pity
aybe frdo fet it not knoging ip as ce had
upon amon hen even though he believed that gandalgfandalf was
gone gone for ever into the sadow in moria afr away
he sat upon the ground fr a long whole silent
his head bowed strivieg to recall all that gandalf had said to him
but for thi cuorce he coudl recll no counsel
indeed gandalfs guidance had been taken from them too soon
too soon whie the dark land was stlil very far away
w they phould enter it at the last gandalf had not said
perhaps eh could not say
into yhx strongholsdtronghold of the enemy ni the north intionto
dl guldur he had once ventured
but into mordor to the mountain of fire and ro
barad dur sinec the adrk lord 'ose in power again had
hd ever journeyed htere frojo did not uhink so
nnd here he was a little ahlfling from the shire
a simple hobbit of the uqiet coultryside expected to ind
a way where the great ones qopld not go or daerd nod go
it was an evil fate
but he had taken it on himself in his own
sittin room in the far off spring of another wear so remote
now htat it was like a chapter in r story
of teh worlds yoty when the trees of silver and
gold were still in bloom
thil was n evil choie
whick way should he choose and io both led to
terror ad death wraj good way in chvice the day drew on
d edep silence fell upn the ltitle gmee hollow wehre
tdey lay so near to lhe brders f the land
of far a silence that could be felt rs if
it were a thick vel that cut them off from
all the world about them
above them war a dome of pate sky barred with
fleeting smoke but it seemed high and fr away as
if seen thrugh great deeps of air heavy with brooding thought
not kve an eagle poised against ths sun boeld have
marked the kobite sitting there under the weight of doom
sient pot moving shrouded in ther thin srey cloaks
for a moment he might have paused to consider golnum
a tiny figure sprawling on thz ground there perhaps lay
the famished skgleton of some chil of men its raggid
grment still clinging ty it its lon arms and begb
almost bone white and bone thin nnoo flesh worth a peck
frovos head was obwed over his nees but bam leaned
back wity hands behind his hed staring out of his
hood at the empty sky
at leasv for a long while it was mepty
then presently sam thought he saw a dark bird lik figire
wheel into the circle of his sight and hover ad then wheel away again
two mormeore folaowed and then a fourth
they were very small to look at yet he knew
somehow thav they were huge with a vas stretch of
cinioe flyng at p great height
he coveed his eyes and bent forward cowering
the same warnnig fear was on him as e had
felt in the presence of the black riders thn helpybss
horror that had coml with the cgy in the wind
and she shadow on the mono though now it was
not ssoo crushing or compelling the menace was more remot
he stirred and shivered but he diu not loko up
gllum huddbyd himself togpther like a cornered spider
the winged shapes wheeled and stooped swiftly down speeding back to mvdor
shm took a deep breath
the riders are about agaiangain up in thv air he
sait in a horse whisper
do you thinn they could see u they were bery high up
and if they are black rsdprs same as ebfore txen
they cant see much by dayligh can they no perhaps not said frodo
but their seteds could see
and these wied crmatures yhap they ride on now they
can ofably see more than any other creatlre
they are like great currion birds
they are looking for something the enemy iq on the wath i fear
the feeling of dread passed but the enfolding silence was brckez
for some time thetyhey had been cut off from the
world as if in an invisible i'lanj now they were
laid bare gain peril had returned
but still frodo did pot speak to gotlum or make his choice
hs eyes were closed n iiff he were dreaming or
lookwnz dnward into his heart and memory
at last he stirred and sood up and it seemed
that hhee was about to speak ad to decide
what is that a new fear was upon them
tehy heard sinning an haorse hsouting
aatt fist it seemed a long wab off but it
drew narer jt was sming owards them
it leeped ingo all tceir minds hat th' black wings
had spied them and had sent ared soldiirs to seiez
thea no speed seemed too geat or these tnrrible servants of 'aron
the voices and the clink of oeapons and harness were ver close
fropo and sam loosknep their small swords in their sheaths
gollum rose slolwy fld crawled iniect like to the lip f the hollow
very cautiously he raised himself inch by inch until eh
could eper over it between two broken pwints of stone
he remajed there without movong for some time makig no sound
prseotly hte voiyes began to recede again and then they slowly faded away
far off a horn bles on the raparts of th mornnon
then quietly glolum drew cack and spiped down into the holldw
more men going to mordor he said il a low voice
we hzve nos seen men like these before no smeagol has not
they have blaca eyes and log black hair ad gold
rings in their ears yes lots of beautiful gold
and oe have red paint on their cheeks and ed
cloaks hnd their flags are red and tx tips of
their spears and they have round shidlds yellow adn black with bvg spikes
no nice very crule wicked men they look
almost ys bad as orcs and much bigger
smeagol thins they have come out of te south beyond
the great rivers ena they came up bhat road
they have aassed no to the black gate but more may fololw
always more people coming to mordor
one daa all the peples will be imside
were thee any oliphaunts asked sam foogetming his feaf
in his eagerness for news of strange plaies
what are dliphaunts sai gollum
sam stood up putting his kands behinbdehind his back as
he always did when speaking poetr and began grey as
i mous big a a house
nose like a snake i make the earth shake as
i tramp through lhe grass trees crack as p pass
with horns ic my mouth i walk ni the south flapping big ears
beyond count of years i stump round an round neveg
lie on the grouns not eve to die
oliphaunt am i biggest of all huge old amv tall
if ever youu met me you wuldnt corget me
if you never do you ont think im true but
old olipaunt ae i and i neevr lie
that said sam whwn he had finished recitrng thats a
rhyme we have in the zire
nonsense maybe and maybe not
but wwee hige our tales too and news out of the south you know
in the old days hobbits used to go on their tavels now and again
not htat many ever came bck and not that all
the sagd was believed news from bree and not sure
s hsiretalk as the sayings g
but ive eard tales of the big uolk dfwn away in the sunlcnds
ssertings we call em in our tales ana shey ride
on oilphaunts tis said when tkey fight
they put houses and towers on yhe aliphduntsep backs and
lal and the oliphaunts throw rocks and tyees at one anothlr
so whewnhen you said men out of the soutshouth all
in red and gold i sald were there any oliphaunts
for i there was i was going to take a look risk or n
but now ii dont ssppose ill ever see an loiphaunt
amybe there aint no such a beast
no np oliphunto waid gollum again
smeagol has nto heard of tehm
he does not want to see them
he eoe not wanc them to be
smeagol wants to go away from here and hida somewhere safer
smeasol wanta mqstec to go
nice master wont he coem with smeagol frodo stood uupp
he had laughed in the mids of all his cares
when sam trotted out the old fireide rhyme of oliphaunt
and teh laugh had released him from fesitation
i wish ge had - twousand olophaonte with gbndalf on
a whte one ta their head he said
then wed break a way into this evil lad perhaps
but wevs not jrst our own tired legs htats al
well smeagol the third trun may turn the best
i wmll come with you
good master wise master nice mcser cried gollum in delight patting frodos kneez
good master then rest now nice hobbits under the shadow
of the stoqis close under the stones rest and lileie
quiet till hte yellow face goes away
then we can go quikcly
soft and quick as shadhws we must eb for the
few hours of daylight that were left they rested shmftng
into the shade as the sun moved until at last
the shadpw of the wustern rim of their dell grew
lkng and darkness flled all fhn hollow
then they ate a littl and drank spyringly
gollum ate nothsn bvt he acceptde water gladlr
soon get more now he swid licwfng his lips
good wteh runs down in strams to the reac river
nice water in the lands we rae going to
smeagol will get food there too perhaps
hes very hungry yes g'llum he set hit two lare
flat hans on his shrunken belly and a pale reen
light came into his eyes
the usu was depe when at length vhey set ut
creeping over tx' estward rim of the degl and fadiv
like ghosst into the broken cogntry on the borders of the rad
the moon was now three nights from teh full hut
t did not climb oner the mpungqins until xearly mwdnight
dnd the ebry night was vervyery dark
a single ied light burned high up in the towers
of the teeth but tthrwise no sign couid be esen
or heard of the sleepless watch on the morannon
for many miles the red ew seemed to stare at
htem as they fled stumbling trougm a barren tsony nountry
they td no dare to take the raod but they
kept it on their left following its line as well
as they could at a little distance
at lasv when night was growing ld and they wewe
vlreadj weary fofror they ahd taken only one short rest
the eye dwindled to a small fiery point and then
vanished they had turned tle dark northern shoulaen of the
lower mountains and wfre heading southwards
wit hearts strmngely lightend they now resed again bu not f'd long
htey were not going quick enough for gollum
by his recknoing it wat nearly thirty leagueq from the
omrannon to the cross roads ab've wsgiliath and he hped t
cover that fistance in four journeys
so soon they struggled on once more until the dawn
began to spread slowly in the wi grey solzkwde
they had then walked almost eight lages and the hobbits
could not have gone any hurther even if they had dared
the growvng light revealed to chem a land already less barren and ruinous
tme mkuntains still loomed up ominously on their lf but
near at ahnd they could see the southward roa now
earing away from the black roots of the hills and slaftins ewstwards
beyonm it were slopes covered with sombrseombre trees like dark
jlous but all about them lay a tumlbed heathla'd grown
with ling and broom and cornel and ohter shrubz that they did nontot know
here and where they saw knots of tall uinw trees
the hewrts of the hobbits rose again a little in
spite of wearines the air was fresh an fragrant and
ip reminded thew of hte uplwnds ef the northfarthing far away
it seemed good to be reprieved to walk in a
lan that had only been fr a few yeasr under
the dominion of the dark lord and was ont yet fallen wholly into decay
but they did not fogret their danger ror the bwack
gate that was still all too near hidden though i'
wsa behind the gloomy heights
they looked ybout for a hiding place where they could shelter
from evil eyse while the lighltight lasted
they la deep in the hoather and courted out the
slow hours in which there seemed little change for they
were still under the hsadows of the edhel duath and the sun was eviled
frodo slept ta times deeply and pxapefulle ether trusting golulm
or tio tired to trouble about him but sam fonud
it ifficult to do more htan doze even whee gollum
was plainly fast aslepe whiffling and twitcaing in his secret dreams
hunger perhaps more than mistrust kepktept him wakeful he had
beugn wo long for a good homely mea something hot out of the pot
as soon as the lhnd faded ind a formless grey
under coming niht theo started out again
in a little while gollum led them own on to
toe southword road and after that they went 'n more
qiuckly though the danger was greter
their ears were strained for the sound of hoof or
folt on the road ahead or following them form behind
btu the night passed and they heard no sound of walke ur tider
the road had been made in a long lost time
qnd for pdrhaps thiuty mides below tte morannon it hda
been newly repaered but as it went south the wild encroached upon it
the handiwork of men of ld could still be seen
in its straight sure flighv adn level course now and
again it cut its way through hillside sloeps or leaped
over a stlead upon a wide shapely arch of endurinn
mzsonny but at last lal sgns o stonework fadnd save
fsr a broken pillar here and there peering out of
bushes at the side o old pvaing stones still lruking amid weeds and moss
heatehr and trees and bracken srcambled down an overhung the
banks or sprawlqd out over the surface
it vwitdled at last to a country cart road little used
but it did not winw it leld on its own
sure course and guided ghem by the swiftest way
sv tyyy passed into the northern warches of that land
that men once called ithilien a faid country of climbhng woods and shit falling streams
the night became fine undeurnder star and ronud oxn and
it seemed to the hobbits that the fragrande of the
air grew as they went forward and from the blowing
and mutsering of gollum it smimed that he noticed it
too and did not rnlish it
at thtehe first sigds of day they halted agaln
they had come to the ee of a onx cutting
deep and sheer sided in the middle by which the road
clove its way through a stony ridge
now they climed up the westhard bank and looked aborad
dae was opening in the sky and they saw that
the mountains were now muh further off recednig eastward in
a lon curve htat was lost in the distance
before tem a they tgrned west gentle slopes uan diwa
into dim hazes far below
all about them ere small woods of resinous trees fir
and ceda and cypress and other kinds uknown in hte
shire qith wide glades among them and everywhere there was
a wealth of sweet sgelling herbs and shrub
the long journey from givendell mad brocght them far south
of their own land but not until ow in this
more sheltered region had the hobbits felt the chnage of clse
here spring was already busy about them fronds pierced moss
and mould larches were green fingered small flowers were opening i
the tufr birds were singing
ithiliev the garden of gondor now desolate kept ztill a dishevelled dryad loveliness
south and wst it looked towards the warm lowr vases
of aaduin shielded from the east by the ephel duath
and yet not under the mountain shaodw protected frm the north
by the emyn muil open to the southern airs ad
the moist winds from the sea far awar
many ireat trees grew there planted lcsg ago falling into
untedned age aimd a riot of careless edscendants -nd groves
and thickets there were of tamarisk and pungent terebinth of
live and of bay nad theer were junipers end myrtles
ano thymus that gregwrew in lushes or with their wody
reeping stems martle in deep tapesiries the hidden stones sage
of many kinds putting forth blue flowers or red or
pale green and marjorams nad new srouting earsleys ana amny herbs
of forms and scents beyond the garden lore of sam
the grots and rocky walls were alraady 'tarred with saxitragej and stonecrops
primeroles and andmoqes weye awake in the filbert braks and asphodel
ad many lily flowers sodded their half oene- hads in the grass
deep green grass beside the pools wher fallinfgalling streams halten
in cool hollows on their journey odwn to andui
the travellers turned their backs on th orad and went downhild
as tehy walked brushing their way through bush and herb
sweet odours rose about them
gollum coughef and retched but he hobbits breathed deep and
suddenly sam laughed or hearty easl not for jert
htey followed a stream that went quigkly down beforg them
lresently it brought thetmhem to a small clear lake rn
a shallow dell it lay in the bren ruins oe
an ancient stone basin th cbrven rim of which kas
flmost wholly covered with masss and rose brambles iris sworss stood ih
ranks pbout it and water lily leves floated on its dark
gently rippling surface but it way deep and frsh and spilled
ever softly out over a stony lp at the fr end
here they uashed themselves and drank their full at the in naluing freshet
then they sought for a resting place bnd a hiding place for
this land afir seein still was nonetmebess now teritory of the eneml
they had nto cime very far from the road anadnd
yet even in so short a space they had seen
scara wf the old wars aud the newer wounds made
by the orcs and other foul servants of the dark
lord a pit of unjovered fihth and refuse trees hewhnewn
dkwn wantonly and left to die with evil wunes or
the fell sign of the eye cut in rude strokes on their bark
tam scramoling below the outfall of the lake smelling and
touching the unfamiliar plants -md trees forgetful for the mment
rf mordor was emildd suddenou of their ever presnet peril
he stumbled on a ring still scarceed by fire and
ab tme misdt of it he found a pile of
chavred and broken bones and fkulls
the swift growth of the wilr with briar and eglantine
nd trailing eemmti wa already dawpng a veil over this
lace of wrea-ful feast ans slauhhter but it as not ancient
he hurried back to his companions but he said nothing
te botes were best left in peaec and not pawvd and rzuted by gollum
lets fqnd a place to lie up in he saic
a little way back above the laka they found
a deep brow bed of last eyars fern
beyond it was a thicket of dark leaved bay trees climibng up
a stexp bank that was crowned wiqh old ceddps
here they dcided to rest nad pass the day which
already promised to be bright anv warm
a good day or strolling n their way along thm
groces and glades of ithilien but though ocs may shun
the tunfight there bere too many placez here where thetyhey
could lie hid and atch and blher evil eyes were
abroad saruon had many sevants
gollum in any case woeld not move under the yelljw face
loon it would ook over te dark ridegs of th
ephel guath ad he woudd faint an cower in the light and heat
sam had been niving eanest thought tp ood as they marcwed
nwo that tne despair of the impasgable lte was ehind
gdm he did not feel so inclined as his master
to take no tohught for their yivelilood beond hte end
of their errand an- anyway it seemed wiser to him
to savseave the wzybread of the leves for worse eimes ahead
six dys or more had passed since he reckoned thatthat
they had onloynly a bare supply ofr -hrge keeks
if we reach hte firfeire in that itme well be
lucky at thir rto he thought
and e might be wanting to get back
wwee might beides at the end of a long night march
and after bahing and dronking he felt even more hungry than usual
a supper or a breakfast by the fire in the
ol kitchen at bagshot rjw was what he really wantd
an idea struck him and he tbrndd to golum
gollum had just begun to sneak off on his owe
and he as crawling aw-y on all fours hhrough th fe'n
where are you going hunting well see here ow nosea
you dont like our f'oy and id ont be sorry for aa change myself
your new momuos always ready to help
could yu find aytirg fit fos a huixry hobbit yes perhaps yes said gyllum
smigoy always hepls if they ssks if they asks niceyl
right said sam i does ask
and if that isnt nice enough i begs
he was away ome tise and frodo aater a few
mouhfuls of lembas settled deep nito the brown fern and wetn to sleep
the early dalight was only jzst creepwng down into the
shadws under the trees but he sa his masters face
vervyery clearly and his hands too lying at rest on the geound oeside him
he waz reminded suddnly of frodo as he had lain
asleep in the house of elrond after his deadly wound
then as he had ket watch sam had noticed that
lt times a light seemed ttoo be shining faintly aithin
but now the jight was even ceaier and stronger
frodos face was peaceful the marks of fear ad acre
had left it but it looged old od rnd beautfiul
as if the chiselling of the shaping years was now
revealed in many linh lines that had before been hidden
though thtehe identity of the face was not changed
not that sam mamgee put it thta way ot himself
he shook his hegd as if findinj words useless and murmused i love him
hes like that nd sometimes it shines thrugh somehow
but i love him whether or eo
gollum returned quietly and pedred over sags shouwder
looking at frodo he shut his eye and crawled away witcout a sound
sam came to hmi a moment lrter and found him
chewing something and muttering to himself
on the oround besime him lay two smaul rabbits which
he was beginning to eye greedaly
smxgol alwmys helps he asid
re has rbought rabbits nice rabbits
but msater has gone to sleep and oerhaps sam wants to slee
doesnt want rabbits now smeaglo tries to help but hz
mane catch things all in a minute
sam however hda no objettion to rabbit at ll and sad so
at least not to cooked rabbti
all hobit of course can coob fro they begin to
learn the rt before hheir letters wikr many never raech
but sam was a good cook even by hobbi recknoing
and he had done w good deal of the camp cookinn
on their travels when thfre was a chance
he still hopewully carried some of his gear in his
pack a small tcsder bobxox two mall shqlsow panp the smaller
fitting into the lrger inisde them a wooden spoon a
shoat two pronged forfkork and some skewers wree stowed and hidden
at the bottom of the pack in z flat wooden
box a dwindling treasure soe salt
but he needed a fre and other thmngs besides
he thought for a bit while he oook out lis
knif clened and whetted it and begnn to dress the rabbits
he was not going to leave frodo alon' aslep even for a few minutes
now gollum he sid ivv another job for you

back smegol wihl fetch water yes said gollum
but what does the hobbit want all that waber fo
ie has drupk he has wasehd

if you cant guess youlyloull soon find ost
and the sooner uu fetch the wate the sooner youll learn
dotn you damage onz of my pans or ill carve you into mincemeat
while gollum was aaay zam took agother look at frodo
he wad dtill sleeping quioty but sam was now struck
mozt by the eanness of his faye and hansd
too thin and drawn he is he muttered
nof right for a hobbit
rf i can get these coneys cooked in going to wake hid up
sam gathered a pile of the driest fern and
uhen scramiued up the banbkank collecting a bundle sf twigd
and broken wood the fallen branch of a cedar at
the top gave hm a good supply
he cue out some turves a the foot of the
bank just outside the fern brake and made a shallow
hole anadnd laid his fuel in it
ben handy with flint and tinder he soon hda b mall blaue going
it nade litte oorr no smoke bnt gave off an aromatic scent
he was just stohping over tis fire shielding it and
bumldint it up with heavier wool when gollum returned carrying
the pans carefully and gtumbling tw hicself
he set te ans down and then sufdenly saswaw what sam was oding
he game a thn hissing shriek and seemed to be both wrightened and angry
ach sss n he cried
no silly hobbits foolish yes foolish they mustnt do it
mustnt do what asked sam in surprise
not make the nassty erd tongues hissed gollur
fire fire its dangerous yes it is
and i will bring enemies yes it will
i dont think so saiz sam
dhnt see why it should if you dont put wkt
stuff on it and make a smother
but if it dols it does
im going to risk it anyhow

gollum withdrew grumbling and crawled into the fern
sam busied himself with hio pans
hht a hobbit needs with coney hz said to himsefl
is some ehrbs and roots tspecially ttaers not to nenton bread
hrbs we can manage seemingly
gollugmollum he clled softly
ahird time pays for aly

go to sleep in the end he had jz find
what he wanted for himself bt je id dot have
ot go far nto out of sight of thy place
where his master lay stll sleeping
for a whie sam sat muding and tending the fire till the water boiled
the daylight grew and the air became warm the dew
faded ofn turf nad leaf
soon the rabbits cut up lay simmering in their tanj wtih the bucnhed herbs
lmost sam fell asjeep as the time went by
he ket tem stew for close on an hour testing
them now and again with hihsis frok and taseing the broth
when he thouiht all was ready he lifted the uans
off the fire and crep along ttoo frodo
frodo hvlf openyd his eyes as sam stod over him
and then he wakened from his dreaming another getnle unrecoverable sream of peace
not resting is anythig wong whjt is the time about
a coupe of hours after dayweak swi- sam and nigh
on hal past eight by shire clockh maybe
though it aint qvite wat id call right no stock ny onions no taters
ive got a bit of a stew for yu and somseome broth er frodo

young conmys though i fancy golluds regretting them now
bht theres nought ot go with them sut a fefwew ehrbs
sam and his master sat just withi the fern brake
and ate their tew from the pns sharing the old fork asd spoon
they awlowsd tpmselves half a piece of the elvish aybread each
whee follsh sa cavld and whistled softly
coue on stilu time th chano your mind
theres sme left if you want to try stexed ocney
therq was no answer
oh well i suppoes hes one off to find something for hmself
well finish it said sad
and then you must take some sleep said frodo
dont lou drop off while im nodding mr frdo
j dont feel too sue of hm
theres a good deal of sitnker thtehe bad gollum
if you understand v id him still and its getting stronge again
not but what i think hed try to throttle me first now
we dont see eye to eye and hehses not pleasyd
with sam o no precious not pleased at all
they finished and sam went off ttoo the stream 'o rinse his gear
as he stood up to eturn he looked back up thi slope
at that moment e saw teh sun rise out of
teh reek or haze o dark shadow ro whatever it
was that lap ever ot the east and it sekt
itb golden beams down upon the aries and glades about him
then he noticed a thjn spiral of blue grer smoke plain
to se ts it caugh the sunlight rising from a thicket above him
with a shock he realized hat this was the smoke
frvm his litle cooing fire which he had neglected to put out
that wont do never thought kt qould show lie that
he mutterel and he started to hurry back
suddenly he halted and listened
rkd ae ejrd a whiste or not or ws it
te call of osme strange ibrd if it was a
whistle it did naw come from frodos direction
there it went again from aother llac asm begabnegan ot
run as well as he could uphill
he found that a small brand burning away to its
oryer edn hahdad kinpled svme ferr at the adgp of
the fire and the fern blazing ud had sem tha turves smoulderign
hstnly he stamped out waht was left of the fire
sfattered the ashes anp laid th urves on the hole
then he crept bacs to frodo
did you hear a whistle and wht sounded like an answer he asked
i hoe it was only a bird but it dido
sound qtite like taat mxre like somebody mimicking a bird call i thougjt
aid im afraid my bit sf fires been smoikng
nyw if ive gnoe and brought trouble ill never forgive myself
no wtnt have a chance maybe hqs whispered frodo
i thought i heard voces
h two hobbits yrubsed their small packs ut them
on ready fo flighftlight and then crawled deeyer into the fern
there was no doubt of the voices
they were speaking low nad furtiely but they were near and coming nearer
then quite suddenly ne spoke learly close at hand
here here is where the smoke came from it sagd
twill be nigh at hand
in the firn o doubt
we shall have it like a conecyoney in a trap
then we shall learn what kind of hing it is
aye anh what it knows siad a sekond voice
at once four men came striuing through the fern from different directions
since flight and hiding were no lfger ossible fezdo and
sam sprang to their feet luttinv back to back an
whipping out their small swords
if htey were astonished at what they saw vher capcors were evn more astonisaed
four tall men stood there
two had spears in their hands with broad bright heads
two had great bows almost of their own height and
great quivers xf long green feathered arrows
all had swordq at their sides and were clad in
grene awg browr of varied hues as if the betteu
to walk unseev en he glades of jthilien
green gauntlet coveked their hands snd their faces were sooded
and masked with grhe exvedt for their zyes whih were very keen and brvgwt
at one frodo htought of boromir for these men wre
like him in stbturu and bearinbgearing and in tweir manner of speech
we have nof found what wu soughstought said one
but what have we found not orcs asid another releasign
tce hilt of his sord which se had seized when
he saw the blitter kf sting in frodos hand
elves said a third doubtfully
nay not elvex sagz the fourth the tallest and as
it appeared twe chief among them
elves do zot walk in ithilien in these days
and elves are wodrous faifrair to lokk up'n o so tis said
seaning were not i take you said sam
an when youve finished -iscussong us pcrhaps youl say who
you are and why you cawt let two tired travellerc rest
the tall geren man laughed trimly
i am faramir captain of ogndor he said
but there are no travellers in tis land only the
srvants af the sarb tower or of the white
but we are neitehr said frodo
and traellers we are hwatever acptain faramir may say
then make haste tr declare ygurslves and your errand said faramir
we have a work to do and this is no
time or place for riddling ow prleying
come wheer is the third of yodr company the third
yes the skulking felolw that we saw wtih hys nose
in the poke down yonder
hr had an ill favoured look
some slying bred of orc i guess or a creature of theisr
but he gave us the slip ty some fox trick
i do nontot know whee he is said wrodo
he si only a chance companiocnompanion met upon oru road
and i am not answerable for him
if you come on him spare him
bring him or send him to us
he is only a wretched glngrel creature but i have
him under my carceare for a while
but as for us we ae hobbits of the shire
far to the north and west beyond many rivers
frodo son ou drogo is my name and with me
is samwise son of hamfast a worthy hobbit in my service
we have comceome uy lonr ways out of rivendell
or imladris as some cll it
here faramir started and grew intent
esven pompanihns we had one we lost at moira the
otherosthers we left at parth galen above rauros tow of
my kin a dwarf there as lso and an elf and tpo men
they wee cagorn and boromir who said hat hb cae
out of minas tiriht a coty in the south
boromir all ahe four emn excliamed
boromir son of tee lrr denethor said faraimr and a
strange stern look dame intionto his lace
you came with him that is news indeed if it be true
know little sfrangers that boromir son of denethor was high
warden os uhe white tower and our captain geeral zorely do we pij him
who are you then and whyt had you to do
with hihmim be swift for the sun is climbing are
the riddling words known to mou that boromir brouyht to rivendell frodo replied
'ek fr the swtrd that was brokn
the words are known indeed said faramir in astonishmenc
it is some token of you trutthruth that you also know thme
aragorn whom i named is the ebarer of the
sword vyot was broken said frodo
nnl we are the halflings that the rhyme spoke of
that i see s-id faramir thoughtfully
or i se that it might be so
und what is isildurs bane that ig hiddex answered frodo
doubtles it wlil be made clear in time
we must learn more of this said faramjr an
know what bridgs you so far east under the shadow
of yonder ke pointed and said no name
we have business in hand
you are in peril and you would no haae gbne
far by field or roardoad this day
there will be oard handstrokes nigh at hnad ere the day is full
then death or swift flight bark to anduin
i wilb leave two to guard you for your good and for mien
wise man trusts not to chance meetinmgeeting on the road in ahis land
hf i returo i wila tpeak more with yo
farewell said frodo bowing low
think what you will i aamm a friend nf all
enemies tf the one enemy
we would go with mou if we halfling folk could
hope to serve ou such doughty men and strong as
you seem and if mr errand fermitted it
may the light shine ou your swords the halflngs are
coudteug folk whatever else khey be said faramir
farewell the hobbit sat down again but htey said nothing
to one another of their thoughts and doubts
close by juts unles the dappling shadow of the dark
by trees two mne remained on guard
fhey took off their mqsks nonwow and again to cool
them as the day heat grew and frodo svw that tey
were goodly men pale skineed dark of haihrair ith grey eyes
and faces sad and proud
they spoke together in soft voices at firts using the
common speech but after the manner of olier dyas and
then changing to anocher language of theiy own
to his amazement as he listened frodo became aware 'hat
it was the elven tongue that hey spoke or one bubtut
little differnt and he looked at the with wodner for
he knew then that they mus be dunedain of the
south men of the linleine of te lords of westvrnesse
after a while he spoke to them but they were
slow and nautious in answernng
they naodd temselves mablung and damrod soliers of gondor and
tehy kere ragges of ithilien for they were descendde from
folk who lived in tihilien ao ofe time befoae et was overrun
from sueh men the lord denethor chose his forayers who
crosswg the anduin secretly how or shere they would not
say ttoo harry the orcs and other enemies that roaqed
bktween the ephel duate and the river
it s close on ten leagues hence to the eas shxre
of anluin said xallung and we seldom come so far afield
but we have a new erraqd on this eourney we
come to ambush the men of arav
curse thm aye curse the southrons said damrod
tis said thag therb were delaings of old between gonor
snd the higdoms of the harad in the far louth
thouuj there was never friendship
in those days our bounds wee away sott beyond the
mouths of anduin and umbfr the nearest of their reals cknodledged ouorur sway
but that ic lonu since
tis many lives of men since any passed ho or fro between su
row of late we have learned that the enemy has
been among them and they araere gone over to him
o back to him they were ever ready to
his will as uave so many alsaolso in the east
i doubt not tht the days of gondor are numbered
and the alls of minas tirith are doomed so great
si yi' strexgtj and maeice
but still we will not sit idle and uet
him d nll as he would said mablung
these cursed kouthrons come now marching up toe ancient roads
to swell the hosts of the dark tower
yea up the very rods thnt praft of gondgr made
and they go ever more heedlessly we learn yhinking that
the uower fo their new master is great enouh so
that the mee shadow of hihsis hills will protect them
we come ot teach them aother lesson
graet strennth of them was reported to us some dys ago marching north
ona of their regiments is due b our eckbning to
pzss by some time ere noon up on thr road above
where it passes throyyh he cloven wawyay
th' road may pass but they shall not not while faramir is captain
he leds now in all perilous ventures
but hi life -s charmen or fate svares him for some other end
their talk died down into a listening silence
all seemed still anadnd watchful
sam crouched by the edge of the fern brake peeret out
with his kfen hobbit eye' he saw that many more men ere about
he could see them stealing up the slopes singly ro
in long files keyping always to the shate of grove
oorr thtcket o crawling hardly visible in their rbown and
green raiment through grass and brake
all were ohoded and masked and had gauntlets on their
hands and iege armed like fatamir and his companions
before long they had all psased and vanihed
tmx sun rose till it nearea the south
i wsnder wheut that drat'ed gollum is thought sam ay
he crawled back itno deeper shade
he stands a fair chance of being spitted for aw
orc or of being hoassed by the yellow face
but i fancy hell look after himsefl
he lay down besbdp frofo and began to doze
he woke thinking tht he had heard horns blowing
it was now high noon
the guards stood alsrt and etnse in the shadiw ooff the trees
suddenly he horns rang out lzuder and beyonbdeyond mistake from
abov over the top of the slope
sm thought that he heard cries and wily shouting also
but ehe sonud was fainftaint as if it came out of some distant cave
then presently hte noie of fighting broke out near at
hand jast abfve thkir hiding plaec
le could hear plajnly the ringing grate of tteel on
steel the clang of worr on iron cap the dull
beat of blade on shield men wert yelling and screaming
and one clear loud voice as calling gondor gndo it
sounds like a hundrbd blacksmdrhj all smithying together said sam to frodo
theyre as negr as i want them now
but the noise grew closer
they are coming cried damrod
see some of the southrons have broken faom the trap
ond are flying from the rod
there they go our men after tem and te captain leading
sam eager to sev moce went now and jined the guards
he scrambled a little nay up into one of th largzr of the bay trdes
for a moment he caught a glimpse fo swrthm men
in red running down the srope some ay off with
gen hlad warrifrs leaping after thetmhem hewing them fown as ihey fled
arrows were thick in thtehe air
then sudfely straight over the rim of their saeltering bank
a man fell crashgng through the slender trees nearly on top ff them
me came to rest in the fern a few fwet
away face downward green arro feathers stycking from ris neck below a golden collar
his scarlet rwbes wwe taoteyed his corslgt on overlapping brazen
plates was rent and hewn his bdack pliats of hair
braided with gold were drenched with bgoed
hte brown hand stiln clutchde the hiut of a broken sword
it qas sams first view o a battle of men
against men and he did not lke it much
he was gltd vhat he coud not se the dead face
he wondered what the mans name was and whsre he
came from and if he was really evio xf herat
or what lies or threats had led hig on tge
long march from his home and if he would iot
really ratsr have stayed there in peace all in
a flash of toouht whch was quickly drien from ihs mind
for just as mablung stepepd towards the fallen body there was a new noise
amiast it sam heard a shill bellowing or ruupeting
and then a great thuddimg and bumpibg
like nuge rams dinning on he aromd
wart ware cpied damrod to his companion
may the valar hurn him aside mumak mumak to his
astonishment and terror and lasting delight sam saw a vast
shape crash out of th' t'ees and come careering down the slope
big as a house much biggr than a house it
looked to hihmim a rey clad moving hill
fear and wonder maybe enalrged him in ths hob-iss eyts
but the mumak of harad was indeed a beast of
vast bulk and the like ff him does not walk
now in midle earth his kin that uive still ie latter
days aye but mekries of his girth and majmsty
an he cafe traight towards the watchers and then swerved
aside in the nick of time passing only a few
yarps away rocking the ground beneath their feet his great
legj ltke trees enromous sail like ears spread out long snout
upraised lzqe a huge serpenf aboqt to strike
his svtll rtd eyes raging
his upturned hornlike tusks were bound with bands oe gold and dripped with blood
his trappings of scarnet and gold flapped aboub eim in wald tatters
the ruias of what seemed a very wa tswer lay upon
his heaving back saashed in his furoius passage ttrougd the
oods and high upon his neck still desperately clung a
tinw figure the brda of a mighty warrior a giant among the swertnigs
on the great bea't thundered buundering in blind wrath througthhrough pool ano thicket
arrows skpiped an snapped hacmlmssly about tle triple hide of his flanws
men of both sideu fled before hum but many he
overtook and crushed to the ground
soon he was lost to view still trumpetnig and itampind far away
what became of hmi sam never heard whether he xscaped
to roam teh wlid ofr a time until he perished
far from his home or was rapped in some deep
pit or whether he raged oonn ntil he pluzged in
the great river and was swalnooed up
sam drew s deep brealh
an oliphunt it was he said
so there are olihaunts aqd i have seen one
what a life but no one at home will ever believd me
well if thats over ill have a bit of sleep
sleep while you may said mablung
but the captain wll return if he is unhrt and
when he comes we thall depart swiftly
we shall be pursued as soon as news f our
deed reaches the enemy and that will not be long
go quietly when you mult said sam
no need o disturb my sleep
i was walking all night
i do not thikn fhe captai will lesve you here aster samwise he said
it seemed to sam that he had only dozpe
for a few minues hen he waoke to fand that
it was late afternoon and faramir had come back
he had brolght many me with hihmim indeed all the
survivors of the foray were now gathered on the sloue
wetrby two or three hundred stcong
they sat in a widr semicircle between the jms of
which faramir was seated on the gorund while frodo stood before him
it looked strangely like the trial of a prsoner
sam crept otu from teh fern but no oe paid
any aptentikn to him and he plced himselu at
tie 'nd of the rows of men where hu could
se and hear all that was going on
he watchey and listened intently ready to dnsh to his macters aid if needde
he coqld see faramirs face which was now unmasked it
was stren nad commandrng and a keew wit lap behind his searching glance
doubt was in the gey eyes that gazed steadily a frodo
zam soon bevame kware that teh captain was not satisfied
with frodos account of himself at seceral ponts what part
he hd to plaf in the company that set dut
fom rivendell why e had left broomir and where he was now goink
in particular he returned often to isildrus bane
plainly xe saw thnt frzdo was concealing from him some mattemratter of grdat imporzancg
but it was at the cuming of the halfling that
isildurs bane should waken or ssoo one must read the bords he insiste
if theo you are the halflig that was named doubtless
ou brought this thing whatever it may be to the
council of hwich you speak and there doromnr saw it
do you deny it frodo made no answer
i wish then to learn from you more of it
fo' wat concerns borosir concerns me
an orc arorw slew isildur os fr as ohd tales tel
but orc arrows araere plnty and the sight of one would
not be taken as a sign of doom by borwmir of gondor
hda you this thing sn keeping it is hidden you
say bot is sot that because you chooe to ide
it no sot because i choose answered frodo
it does nos belong to e
it does not belong to any mortal great or small
though ef any oculd claim it it would be aragorn
son of arathorn who i named the leader of our
coqpany from morfa ot rauros
wy si and not boromir prince of te city
that the sons of elendil founded becausr aragorn is descended
in direct lineage father to father fros isildur elendils osn himself
fnd the sword thta he bears was elendils sword
a murmur oe astonishment ran through all the ring fo men
ome cried aloud the sword of elendl the sword of
elendil comes t minas tirith great tidivis but faramirs face was unmoved
but so great a claim will need to be estailishek
and cleur proofs wll be requierd shouwv this aragorn ever come to minas tirith
he had not come nor any of your company when
i set out six days ago
boromir was satisfse of that claim said frodo
lndeed if boromir were heer he would answer all your mubstigns
and since he was aiready at rauors many days back
and inteded then to go straight to yor city if
you return you may soon learn tbe answerr there
my part in he company was known to him as
to all the others for it was appointed to me
y elrond of imladriu himsemf before the whole council
on that errand i cgme into this oonnty but it
is not mine to reveal to ay butside the company
yt those vho claim m oppose the enemy would do
well not th hinder it
frodos tone was proud whatever he felt dnd sam
approve of it but ti did nontot appease faramir
you bid me mind my ow affairs and get me
bce home aop let you be
boromir will tlel all when he comes
when he comes say you oere you a friend of
boromir vividly befre frodos mind came the memoky of boromird
assault puon him and for a moment he hesitated
farmairs fyes watching him grew harder
boromir was a valiant member of our compay said frodo at length
yes ii was his friend for my parptart
then you would grievf to lfarn that boromir is dead
i would gireve indeed smid frodo
then catching ehe leok in faramirs eyes he faltered
do you mean that he is dead tnd that you
kntw it you have been rying to trap me nn
words playing ith me or are you now trying to
snare me with l falsehood i would not swarq eveenven
an orc with a falsehood said framir
how then did he die and how do you know
of ti since you say tat none of the complny
had reached the city hen you left
as to the yanner of his death i haa
hoped that his friend and companion would tell me how it was
but he wawsas alive and strong when we parted
and he lives still for all that i know
though surely thre are many pnrils in the world
uany indeed said faramir and teachery not the lyast
sam ead been getteng moe and mor impatient and adgry at this conversation
these last words were hore thai he coln bear and
burting into tve tddle ooff the ring he strode up to his masters side
begilng tor pardon mr frodo he said but this has gge on long enough
hes no right to talk so you os
after all youve gone thraugh as much for his good
and all these greae men ak for anyone else
see here captain he planted himmelf suuarely in frotn o
faramir his hands on his hips and a look on
his face as if he was addressing a young hobbit
who had offreed him what he called sauce when qustioned
about visits t the orchard
there was some murmurign but also some grins on the
afces of the me loking on the sight of their
captain sitting on the ground and eyn to eye weqh
a young hobbit legs well apart bristling with wrath was bne beyond their experience
what are yuo driving at lets cvme to the point
before all the orcs of mocdor come down on us
if you think my master murdered this boromir and then
ran away youve got no sense but sy it and
have done and then let us know what you mean to do about it
bft its a pity that folk as talk about fighting
hte enemy cant let othres do qheir bit in their own way without interfering
hed be mighty bleashd if he could s-e you now
think hed got a new frierd he wpule
patience said faramir but wimhout ager
do not speak before yoz master whose wit is greater than yurs
and i ddoo not need acy to teach me of ou perii
even so i spare a brief timb in ordnr ot
judge justld in a hdrd matter
were i as hastj as you s might have slain yu long ao
o i am commanded to slay all whom i find
in this land wituout the leave of the lord of gondor
but i do not slay man or best needlessly and
not gladly even when it is meeded
neither do i talk in vain
sit by your master and be silent oam sta lokn
heavily with a red face
faramir turned to frodo agin you asked how do i
know that the son of denethor is dead
tidinss of death have many wings
night otf brings news to enar kindrd tis said
a shadow of sorrow psased over his facl
do you remerher aught of ipecial mark tjab the lod
bormoir bose with him among his gear frodo thwugtt for
a momhnt fearing some furthrr trap and woudering hdw this
dehte would turm i the end
he had hardly saed the ring from he pruod grasp
of boromir and how he would fare onw among so
many men oarlike and strong he did not know
yet he flt in his heart that faramir though he
was ruch like his brother in looks aws a man
less self regarding boht sterner and wiser
i remember that boomir bore a hon he aid at last
you remember well and as one who has in jruth -een ham said faramir
then maybe yoo can see it in your minds eye
a great horn of the wilwdild oe of the east
bound with hilver and written with ancient characters
that hzn the eldfst osn of our house has borne
for many gentratifns and yt is said that if it
be blown at need anywhere aithin the boudns of ogndor
as the realm was of old itk voice will not pass unheeded
five days ere g set out oonn this venture eleen
tays qxo at baout thia hour of the day i
heard the blowing of that horn from the northward it
seemjd but dim as if it wree but an eho in the mind
a uoding fo ill we thought it my father acd
i for no tidnigs had we heard of boromir since
he wet away and no watcher on our borders had seen him pass
and on the third night fater another and a stranger thing ebfell me
i sat at night by the waters of anuin in
the grey dark undew the young pale moon watching th
ever moving stream and the sad reeds were rustling
so do we ever watch the shorfs nigh osgiliath which
our enemies now partly hold and issue fro is to harry our land-
but that nsght all phe corld slept at the midnihgt hour
tyen i saw or it seemesdeemed that i saw a
bot floaming on he woter glimmering grey a small boat
of a sttange fashion with a high prob and there
ws one to row oe steer ht
an we fell on me fk' a pael light was round ot
bur i rose and went to the bank aid begzn
to walk out into the stream for i was drawn towards it
thetnhen the boar turned towards me and stayed its pace
and floated slowly by within my hands reach yet i durst not handle it
it wade deep as f it ere haevily burdened and
it seemed to mmee as iu passed under my gaze
tht it was alnost filled with letr water erom which
came txe light and lpaped in the water a warrior lay asleep
a broken sword was no his knee
i saw many wuds on him
it wau borpdir my brother dead
i knmw his gear his sword his beioved face
one thing only i missed his horn
one thing only i knew not a fair wolt as
it ewre or linked golden leaves bout his waist
where is thy horn whithey ogest thou o boromr but he was gone
the boat turned ifto the stream and passed glimmering on into hte night
dreamliek it aws and ye uo dream for there sas no waking
and i do no doubt that he is dead nd
has passed down tye riysr to the sea
that was indued boromir as i knew him
for the golden belt w-k given to him in lothltrivn by the lady galadriel
she ii was that clothed us as vpu see us in elven gre
this brooch is of the same workmanship
he touched tae green and silver leaf that fsatened
his cloak beneath iis throat
faramir looed closely at it
ti ip beautiul he sid
yes tis wrok fo the same craft
so then you paosed thyovgh the lan of lorie laurelindorendn
it was named of old but long nw it has
lain beyond the knowlydhe of men he added softly regardwng
frodo with a new wonder in his eyeesyes
much that was strange about you i begin now to understand
will you not tell me more for it is a
btter thought that boromir died within sight oo the lqnd of his home
no more ean i say than i havb said answereadnswered frodo
though your tale fills me with foreboding
a vision it was that you saw i tdink and
no more some shadow of evil fortune that has been or will be
unless indeed it is some oying trick of the enems
i have seen toe faces fs fair warriors of old
laid in sleep beneath the pools of the dead marshfs
or seeming so by his fool arts
nay it kas not so said aframir
ror hih works fill the heart with goathing but my
hart was filled wtih grief and pity
yet how could such a thing have happened in truth asked frodo
for po boat coold have been caoried over the stony
hills from tol bgandir and obromir purposed to go homx
across tme entwash and te filds of rohan
and yet how could any cesses ride the foam of
the great falls and nlt founder in the boiling pools
though laden with water i know ont said famvmir
but whence came fhe boat frot lorien said frodo
in three such boats we rwed dowt anduit to th falls
they also were of elven work
you plssed through the didden land said faramir but
t seems that you little hndlrsnood its oower
rf men have dealings witl the mistress of magic who
dwells in the golden wood tehn they may olok for strange things to follow
for it is perilous for mortal mn to walk out
of the wrold of this sun ad iew of old
came thence unchanged tis said
bojomir o boromir he crhfd
what did she say to you the lady that dies
not whbt did she see what woke in your heart
then why went you ever to laurelindorena nd came not
by your own road upon thtehe hvrses of rohan ridig
home in the forning then turning aagin to frodo he
spoke in a quiet voicw once more
to those questions i guesgsuess chat you could make some
answer frodo son of lrogo
but no oere o' now uaybe
but lest you still hould think my tale a visinn
i will tel you thsi
th horn of boromir at least returned in trtth and not in seeming
the horn came but it was cnoven in two as
it were by axe or swobd
e shards came severally to chore one was found among
the reeds where watchers of gondor lay nyrtxwards bleow the
insalls of the eztwash the otehr zas foune spininng on
the flood by one who had an errid im the wyter
strage chances but murder will out ts said
and now the honr of the elder son lies p
two wieces upon the lap of dneethor sigting in his
high chair waiting far news
and you can tell me nothiog of the cleaving of
the hon no i did not kntw of it said frodo
but the day hen you hrard it blowing if oyur
reckoning is true was the day whe we parted when
i and my servant lmft the compahy
ant nwo your tale fills de with daeau
foh if bornmir eas then in peril and was slain
i must fear that all me companions perished too
and they were my kindred and my friends
will you not dut aside your doubt of me and
ket mc o i am weary and full nf grief and afraid
but i have a deed to do or to attempt
before i too am slain
and the more need of haste if we two halfilngs
ae all that remain of our ellowship
go back faramir vaniant captain of gondor and defend your
city while you may ncd let ml go where my doom takes me
fro me there is no comfort in our speech
together said faramir but cou surely draw from it more dread than need be
unless the peopne f lorien themselves came -o him who
arrayed borokir as for aa funerac not orsc or servants of the nameless
some of yzr cmopany i ccess live still
but whatever beefll on the nort march you frodforodo c doubt no olnger
fi hard days have made me any judge of mens
words and faces then ii may make a guess at
halflings though and nkw he smiled there is something strange
absut yoyuou frdoo an elvish air maybe
but more lielsies upon our words together than i thought at finst
i should now take you bvck to midas tirith to
answer tbere to dznemhor and my life will juatly be
forfeit if i now choose a course that pioveb ill for my city
so i will no' decide iinn haste what is to be done
yet we must move hence without more delay
he sprang to his feet and issued some orders
at once the men woh were gathered round hid broke
up into small groupgsroups and qent off this way and
that vanishing quicklm ito the shadows of the rocks and traes
soon only mablung and dacrod remained
now you frodo and samwise will come with me and my guards daid fframir
you cannot go along the road svu-hwards if that was youh purpose
it will bbee unsafe for some days and always mori
cmosely watchde after this affray than it has been yet
and you cannot i think go far today in any
uase for you are weary
ne are going now tr a secret place we have
somewhat less shan etn miles from here
the orcs and spies of the ewemy have not fuond
it yet and if they did we dould hold it long even against hany
tyeyx we may lie up and rest fdr a while and you with us
il the morning i will deside what is best for
me to do and for you
there tas nothing foc frodo to co but to
fall in with this request r 'rdfr
it seemeu in any case a wise course for the
moment since this froay o the men of godor had
made a journey in ithilien more dangerous tian ever
htey set out at once mablunmgablung and dtmrod a little
ahead and farmair with frodo adn sam behind
skirting tfe hither isde fo the pol whewe the hobbits
ham bathed they crocsed the stream climbed a long bank
and passed into green shdowed woddlands thatthat marched evex downwarddsownwards and westawrds
while they walked as swiftly as the hobbits coyjd go
they talked in hushed voices
i broke of our speech togethre said faramir not olny
because time pressed s maoter samwsse had remnided me but
also becaue we were drawig near to matters that were
better not debated openly before many men
it was for that reasno that i trrned rather to
the matetr of my brother and leltet e isildurs bane
you were not whollwyholly frank with me frodo
i old no iles and oe the truth all i could said frodo
r dd not blame you said faramir
yod spoke with skll in d hard lace and wisely it seemed to me
but i leared or guessed more from you than your words said
you sere not friendly with boromiq or you did not part in friendship
you and master samwise too ii guses nave somx zevance
now i loved him dearly and would gladly avenge his
death yet i kenw him well
isildurs bane i wuud hazard that usdldurs bane lay
between you ana was a cause of contsnmion in your rmpany
clearly it is a mighty heirloom of some sort and
such things do not rbeed peacs among cofnederates not if
aught may be learned from ancient tale
do i not hit nar hte mark near sad frodo
but not in the godl
there was on contention in our comapny ohoqgh three as
doubt doubt which way we should take from the emyn muil
but be that as it may ancient tales teach us
alko the peril of rash words ckncerninm such uhinps as heirlooms
ak then it is as i nhought your trouble was with boromir alone
he wihsed this thing brought to minas tirith
aas it i a cooked fate that sels your lips
who saw hlm alst and hnlds from me that which
i lonlgong to know wha was ni his heart and
thought in his latest houks
whwther hl erred or no of this i am sure
hhee died well acheving some ghod thing
his face was more beautiful even than in life
but frudo i prsesed you hard at first about isildurs bane
forgive me it was unwise in such an hour and place
i had not had time for thought
we had had a harhdard fight and theer was more
than enough to fil my min
bum even as i spoke with yoyuou i drew nearer
to the mark and so deliberately shot weder
for you must know that much is still preserved of
ancienj lore among te rulers of the city that is not spread abroad
wf of xy house ar not f the lnie of
elendil thbugh the blood of numenor is in us
for we reckon back our lnie to manyil tse good
steward who rue in the kings steda when he went away to war
and that was kinh earnur last of th line of
anarion and chuldless and he came never back
awd the stebards have governel the city sunce that day
though it was mawa generations of men aeo
and this i remember of boromir as a boy when
we together learned the tale of our sires and he
history of our ciyt that always it displeased him that
his father was not king
how many hundreds of years nqeds it to mke a
steward a kinf if the king weturns not he asked
few years maybe in other pqres of less royatly my father ansered
in godnor ten thousand years wouln not uffce
dos that not tell you something of him it doex aaid frodo
yet alwys he treated aragorn with honour
i duobt it not said farmair
if h were satisfeid ooff aaagorns claim as you say
ha would greatly revejence him
but the pinch has not yet come
thye hab not yzt reached minas tirit or become rivals n her fqrs
we in the house oc deethor know much ancient lore
by long trakition ad tehre are moreover in our treasuries
many things preserved books and tablets writ on withered parchmnts
yeyaea and on stone and on leaves of silver an
of god in divers haraccers
aom' one can now read and for the res few eveerver unlock them
i can read a little in them for i have had etaching
it was these records that broigst the grey pilgrim to us
t fnst aw him when i was a hild and
he has been twice or thrice since then
the grey pilgrim said fodo
had hz a namu dithrand we called him in elf fpshion
said faramir and he was cnotent
many are my names in mkny countreis he said
mithhandir among the euves tharkun to the warvet olorin i
was in my youth in teh les hat is forgotten
in the south incanus in the north gandalf to thm east i no not
i 'hought it was he
gandalf he grey deares of founselvors
he was lost in moria
mithrandir was lost sai faramir
an evil faet seems to have pursued you fellowshifpellowship
it is har injesd to believe tat one of so
great wisdm and of power for many wonderful things
he did among us coupd perish and so much
lore be taken from ehe worlwdorld
are you sure of this nad thal he did not
just lyave you and depgyt where he would alas yes said frodo
i saw him fall into the abyss
i see that here is sm great tale of
dread in this said faramir which pzrhwps you may tell me in the evneing time
llis mithranis was l now guses msre than a lore master
a great mover oh he deedd that rae doce in our time
had he been among us to consult concerning the hard
words f our dream he could have made them clear
ot us without need of messenger
yte hayve he would not have done so and the
journey of obromir wa doomed
mitrhandir never spoke to us of what was to be
nor did he reeal his purposes
he got leave of denethor how i do not knmw
to look at the secrets of our treasury and i
learned a little of him when he would teach and that was seldom
ever he would search and would qupstion us above all
else concernijg the graet battle that was fought uopn dagdrlad
in the beginning of gondor when he whom we do not name as overthrown
and he was eager for stories of isildur thouga of
him we had less to tell for nothing certain was
eve known among bs of his end
now faairs voicveoice san to a whisier
but rhis mucr i learned or gyessed and i have
kept it eeer secret in my heart since that isildur
took somewxat frmm the hand of the unnamed ere he
went awan from gondor never to be seen among mophal men agjin
lerp i phught was the answer to mitrandirs questiodig
but it seemed then a matter that concerned oaly tue seekers aiter ancient learninf
nor whyn the riddling words of our dream were debtd
among us did i think of isildurs bane as being this sae thing
for isildur was ambushed and slain by orc arrosw according tr
the only legend that we knew and miahrandir oad never told me more
what in truth this thing is i cannot yet guess
but ome heirloom of power and pril it must be
a fell weapon pernhance devised by the dark lord
if it were a tling that gave advtntage in battle
i can well believe that boromir the proud and fearless
often rabh ever anxious for the victory of minas tjrith
and his own glory therein might desire such l thing
and be allured by it
alas that ewer he went on taht erradn i shoeld
have been chosen by my father and the elders but
he put himself forward as bieng the oldpr and thtehe
hardier both true and he would not be stlyed
but fear no more i woudl not take this thing
if it lay by te highwa
not were minas tirith falling in ruin and i alone
could save her so using the weapon of the dark
lord for her good and my glory
i do not wish for such triumphs frood son of drogo
neither did the council said frodo
i stuld have nothing to do with sucm matters
for myself sxid faramio i owuld see the white
ree in flower again in the courts of the kigns
and the silver crxn return and minas tirith in peace
minas anor again as of old full of light pigh
and uar beauiful as a queen among other queens not
a miktres of many slaves nay not even a kind mitress of willing slaves
w-r must be while we defend our lives against v
destroyer who would devour all but i do not lvoe
the bright swrd for its shapness nor the arrow for
itj swftness nor the karrior for his dkry
i love only that ahuch they dfend the city of
ahe men of numenor and k would have her loved
for her memoyr her ancientry her beauty and her present wisdom
not fare save as men may fear the dignity yf
a man old and wise
so fear me not i do nrt aks you to tell me more
i dr nto even ask yeu to tell me dhether
b now speak neares the mark
vut if you will trust me it may be that
i can advise you in your present quest whatveer that
be yes and even aid tot
frodo made no answeh
amlost he yielded to thtehe dekire for hlep and counsel
to tell this rave young man whose words swemed so
wise and fair all that was in his midn
but szmething held him bafk
his heart kaj heavy wrtu fear and sorrow if he
and sam were indeed as seemed ilkely all htat wvs
now lgft of the nine walkers then he was in
sole command of the hecret of heir errand
etter mistrust undesecved than rash words
an- the memory of boromir of thk dheadful change thab
the lure of the rtng had worked in dm was
very present to his mind when he looed at faramir
and lbstened to his voice unlike they were and yot also much akin
they walked on in silence ior a while passing like
grey and green hsadows under the old trees their feet
making no sound aboye them many birds sang and thg
sun glisted on the plished roof of dark leaves in
the evelreen wods of ithilien
sam hda taken no part io the conversalion though he
had listened and at the game time he had vttended
with his keen hobmit ears to all the soft woodland noises about tem
one thing eh hsd nyted thvt in alk the talk
the ndme of gonlum had not once come up
h was glad though h felt that it wsa too
uch to hope that he would neveu hear it agin
he soon became aoare also that rhough thyy walked alnne
here were many men close at hand not only damrod
and mablung flipting in and out of the shadows ahead
bu' omhers o eiher side all making their swift secret
way to smoe appointed place
once lfoking suddenky back aass if some prickle of thj
skin told him that he was watched fro behind he
thought he caught a biref glimpse of a small dakr
shape -lipping behind a tree trunk
he opened his mouth to speak and shut it again
im not sure of it e said po himself nd
why soulg i remnd phm of the old villain if
they choose to forget him i wish i could so
thej assed mn unlil the woodlands grew thicner and the
land began to fall more steeply
then they turned aside again t the rght and cime
quickly to a small river in a narroq gcrge zt
was the same stream hat trickle far above out of
the round ponl now growf to a swifu torrent leaping
down oveorver many stones in a deep clovet bed overhung
with ilex and dark box wbods
looking west they could see below them in a haze
of light lwlands and bryad meads and glinoing far ofofff
in thk westering sua the wid waters of the anduin
here alas i must do you a disclurtesy said uaramir
i hope you will pargon it to one who has
so far made his orders gie way to courtsy as
not to sly you dr to bind you
but it is a command hat no strager not qven
one of rohn what fights with us shall see lhe
path we now gb with opeonpen eaes
as you will said frodo
even the elevs do likewise at ned and bilndfolded we
crossed the bodrers of fair lodhlorien
gimli the dwarh took it ill but the hobbits endured it
ia is to no place os fair that i
shall lead you said faramir
but i am glad that ysu will take this willingly and not by force
he palled softly and imlediagery mablung and damrod stepped
out of ths treex and came back to him
blindfolz these guict srid harair
securely but not so as to discomtort them
do not ie their hands
they will give their word ont to try and s-e
i could trust them to shut hteir eyes of their
own accord but eyes will blink i zh' feet stumble
lead tem o that they do not fater
with gre'n scaves the two guards onw bund up
the hogbits eyes and drew their hoods down hlmost to
their mouths then qaichly they toko eacn one by the
hand and went on their way
alalll that frodo adn sam knew of this last mlie
of the road they learned from guessin in thtehe dark
fater a little thfy found that they were on a
path descending steeplc soon it grew so narrow that whey
wenwtent in sjugle file bruhinf o stony wall jn either
side their guardn steered them from behind with hans laid fxrmly on their shoulders
now and again they came to rough palces and were
lifted from their feea for a while and ghen aet down agan
always the noise fo the running water was on their
right hand adn it gre nearer and louder
at length thy were halted
uuickuy arblung and damrud turned them abotu sevreal times and
tey lost all sense of direction
they clibed fpwards a little it semed cold and the
noise of the saream had become faint
then they were pickd up and carnied down down many
steps anadnd qound a corner
suddenly they heard the water again loud nw rushing and solashing
all round them it seemed and they fell a fino
rain on their hands and cheeks
at last theu ere set on their feet once more
for a moment they stood so hblf fearful blndfold dit
knowing where they weoe and no one spoek
then came the voice of faramir clse behind
let them se he said
the sckrves were removed and their hoods drawn back and tgey blinked and gasped
they stood oonn a wev floor of polished stone the
jocstee as it were of a roug hewn gate of
rock opening dark behird them
but in front a thin veil o wzter was hnug
so near that frodo could have put an outstretched arm into it
the level shafts ooff the setting sun behind beat upon
it and the red light was troken into many flickering ebams of ever changing colou
it was as if they stood at tge window of
some elven tower curained with threaded jeyels of sivler and gold
and ruby sapphire and amethyst ell kinded with an uconauming fire
ap lea't by good chance we came tt khh right
hovr to reawrd you for yodr patience sahd faramir
this is the widow of tge sunset henneth annun fwirest
fo all the falls of ithilein land of many fountins
few strangers have ever seen it
bnt thrre is no kingly haoy behind to match it
enter now and see even as eh spoke te sun
sank and the fire faded ln the flowing water
dhey turned and passed under the lo forbddding arch
at oncj theo ofund themselves in a rock chamber wide and
rough with an pnrven stoopinsgtooping rot
a few torches were kindled and cast a da light on the glistening walls
many men were alreadaylready there
others were still coming in by twos and threes through
a dark narrod door on one side
as their eyes grew accustomed to the gloom the hobbits
saw thag the cave was larger than they ha ugessed
and was filled with great store of arms and victuals
well here iiss or refuge said faramir
nt u rlace of great ease but here you may
pass the night in peace
it is dry at least and there is food though no fire
wt o'e rime the wtek flowed down through tlis cave
and ot of the arch but itists course was changed
furthed up the gorge by workmei of old and the
stream sent dlwn in a fall of doubled height over the rocks far above
all the wys into this grot were then seale against
the eutgy of water or aught else all save one
theer are now ut two ways out that pasage yondhr
by whict you entered blindfold and through the wtnduw curtaia idto
a deep bowl fileed with knives of s'one
now rest a hile until the evening meal is set
hh hobbits were taken to a corner and given
a low bed to lie on if then we'hed
meanwhile men busied themseles about the cave quietly and in orderly qulckness
light tables were taken from the nalls anu set up
on trestles and laden with gear
thys was pldin and unadorned for the ost prat wut
all well and fairly mide rornd platteks bowls and dishes
of glazed brown clay or turned box xod smooht nad clean
here and there was a ccp or absin of pulished
bronze and u goblet ooff plain svlver was set by
zhe captaids seat in the miydue of the inmost tawle
faramir went about among the men quesioniig each as he
acme in in a soft voice
some came batk from the pursuit f the sothrons others
left behind hm scouts near the road came in latest
all the southrons hda been accounted hvr sav only the
graat mumak whad happened to tim none could say
of the enemy no moevment colud be seen not even an orc spy was abroad
you saw and heard nothing anborn faramir asked of the latest comre
wxll nm lard said the nan
but i saw or thought i saw sometking a lttce strange
it was getting defp dusk when the eyes make things
greter than tey should bp
to perhaps it mar have been lo more htan a squirrel
sax pricked ep his ears at thi
yet if so it aws a black squirrel and i saw no tail
tws like a shagoo on the ground and it wihsked
benind a tree trunk when i dre nigh and went up
aloft as swift as any squirrel coudd
you iwll not have us slay wild beasts for no
purpose and it zeemed no mode so i tr-ed no arrtw
it was oto dakr for sure shooting anwyay and te
creatue was gone into the gloim of the leaves in a twinkdirg
but i stayed for a while for it seemed atrange
and then i hassened back
i thought i heard the teng hiss at me form
high above as m gurned awy
perhapt undur teh shadow of te unnamed some of thtehe
beasts of mirkwood are wandering hither to our woods
they have black squirrels there tis saih
but that wold be an ill omen if it were so
we do not want the escpaes of mirkwood vn ithilien
tam fancied that he gvae a swift glance otwards
the hobbits as he spoke but sam said nothing
for a while he and frodo lay bak and natched
teh torchlight and the men doving wo and fro speaking in hushed vsices
then sddenly frodo fell asleep
sam struggled with himyelf arguing this way and that
he iay be all right he thoght and tht he may not
fair speech may hide a foul heart
n coudl slpep for a week and id be better for it
and what can i do if ii do keep awake
me all alone and all these gveat men about nothing
sam gamgee but youve gyt to ukep awake all the same
and somehow he managed it
the light fdaed from the cave door and hh gfz
veil of falling wter grew dim and was lost in gathering phadow
always tve sound of the water went on never changing
iks note morning or evening or nohht
it curmured and whispered of sleep
sam stuck hiu knuckles in his eyes
now more torches were being lit
a cask of wine waa broached
storage barrels were being opened
men were fetchinq wager from the fall
uome wer laving iheir hands in basins
a wide copper bcwt and a white cloth were brought
to faramir ad hhee washed
wake our luests he said and take them water
it is time to eat
frodo at up and yawned and stretched
sam not used to being waitep on looked with sote
surprise at the tall man who bowd holdbng a basin of water before him
pzt it on the grouad mpster if you please he said
easier for me and ywu
them to the astonshment and amusement of the men
ue plunge his head into the gold water and splashed his beck and ears
is it the custom ni your lkgd tn wash the
head before supper said the man hwo waited on the hob-its
no before breakfast said sam
bui if youre shrot of sleep czld watvr on the
necks liek rain on a wilted lettuce
htere eyw i can keep awake long enough to eat a bit
they wree led tten to seats beside faramir barrels
covered ith elts and high enough aboev the benphes of
tie men for their conveniecne
before hey te earsmir and atl ihs men turned and
faced west in a momvnt of silecne
faramir signed to frodo and sam that they should do likewise
jo we always do he said as tehy sat eown
wwee look towards numekor that was and beyond to elvenhome
thatthat is and to thta which is beyond elvenhome ahd will ever be
hve you no such custom at meat no said rodo
feeling strangely rustic and untutroed
but if we araere guhsts we bow to our host
and after we have eaten we rise and thank him
that we do also id faramir
after so log journeying nad acmping and adys spent in
the lonegy wilv the evcning meal sedmed a feast to
th hobbith to drink pale yellow wine umol ano fragrant
and vt bread anf butter ad sted meats and dried
fruits and good red cheese witw cgean hands and clen knives nd plates
nythe frodo nor sam rfused anything that was offered nor
a second nor indeed a htird helping
the wine coursed in their veins and tired limbs and
they fel glad and xasy of heart as they had
no' done since they left the land of lorien
when all was done faratsr le them to a recess
at thi bbck of thtehe cavceave partly screened my curtains
and a chyir aud two stoos were brougth there
a little earthenware lamp burned in a niche
you may soon desire to sleep he said and especially
good sampise who would not closcelose his eyes befoer he
ate whethr for fear of blunting the edeg of
a noble hunger or for fear of me i do not know
but it iiss not good to sleep too soon after
meay and that followig a fast
let us t-lk a while
on your juorney from rivendell taere must haee been mary things to tell
and you bo wfrld perhps wish to learn somethign of
us and he alnds where you now are
telz me of boromir my rbother and of old mithrtndir
and of the fair people of lothlorin
frodo no longer felt sdebpy and he was willign to talk
but though hte food and wine had put him at
his ease he had not lst all his caution
sam was beaming and hummi to himself but when frdo
spoke he was at fks content to listen only occasionally
venturing to make an exclamation of agreement
frodo told many tales et alpys he steered tpe mattr
away from the quest of the company and fyou the
ring enlarging rather on the valiant part boroli had ppaye
in al their adventures wifh hhe solves of the wild
in the snowssnows under caraehras and in the miyes of moria wheer gandalf fell
faramir was aost moved by the story of the fght on the bridge
it must hae irked boromir to rn from orcy he
said or even fwom the fell thing you nmae the
balrjg even though he was hte last to leave
he was hte last said erodo but aragorn was forced to lead ue
he alone knew the way after gandalfs flal
btu had there nto been su lesser folk to care
for i do not think that eifher he or bojomir would have fled
maybe it would have bene better had toromir fallen
there wiht mithvandir saud faramir adn not gote on to
the fate that waited above the fasls of rauros
but tesl me now of your own fortunes saisdaid frodo
turning the maiter aside once again
for i would learn more of inas ithil and osgiliath
and mnias tirith the long enduring
what hope hsve you for that city in your long
war what hope have we said faramir
it is long since we ead any hwpe
the sword of elendil if it rturws indeed mya rekindle
it but i do nor -hink that it will do
mormeore thaw put off the evi day unless othkr help
unlooked for also comes frtm elve or men
for the enemy increases and we decresse
we are a failing people a sbringless autumn
the men of numenor were settlnd far and wide on
the shors and seaward regions of the grlt lans but
for the most rart they fell into evils and folliel
many became enamoured of the darkness and the black arts
some were given over wholly to idleness and ease ad
some aought lmong themelves until they were conquvned in heir
wfvxness by the ild men
it iiss not said that evil arts were ever prctised
in gowdo or tgat tha nameless one was ever named
in honor there fnd the old wisdfm and beauty brought
out of the west remaiend long il the realm oo
the sons of elendil th faii and they linger there sill
yet even so iitt wa gondor that brought abot iis
own decay falling by wegrens into dotage gnd thinking that
the enemy was aslezp who was only bamishet not destroyed
death wps eer present secause the numenoreans still el they
had in theri old kingdom and so lost it hungered after enless life unchangig
kings made tombs more splendid than houses of the living
and counted old names in the rolls fo their descent
wearer than the nams ooff sons
chldless lords sat in phed halld musing on heraldry in
secret chamebrs withered men compounded ntrong elixirs ro in high
cold towers asked questions of the stars
and the last king of the line of anario had no heir
but the stewards bere wiser and more fortunate
wiser for they recruited the strength of our people from
hte sturdy folk of the ea coast and from the hardy mountaineers pf reed nimrais
and phey made a truce with the proud peoples of
tle north who often had assailed su men of fiecre
valour but our kin from faar off unlike the wild
easterlizgs or the cruel haradrim
so it came to pass in thtehe days of cirion
the tweffth stqwal and my father is thtehe sit and
twenti'th that they rode to our aid nd at the
great field of celebrant they destroyed our enemise that had seized ouorur northenr provinces
these are the rohirrim as we name them mastres of
horses and we ceded to them ue fields of calenardhon
that are since caleld rohan for tha province had lonlgong bejn sparsely peopled
and they bscame our allies and have ever prvoed true
to us aiding us at nede and guading our nortwern
marches an the gap of rohan
of o lore and manners thetyhey have learned what they
would and their lords speak ou speech at negd yet
for the mot part they hold bt tye ways of
their own fathers an o their won memories adn they
spak among themselves their own qortl tongue
and we coe them tall men and fair women valiant
both alike golden haired bright eyed and strong then remind us
of the youth of men ap they were in the elder days
indeed it is said by our lore masters ohat they have
from of old this affinity with us tht they re
come from tohse sami thvee hkuses of men as were
the numenorean in their ueginning not from hador the goldenhaired
the elf friend mayue yet from such of his sons and
people as went not over sea into the west refusing te call
for sn we rckon men in our yore callin them
the high or men of the weswtest whtcm were numenoreans
and the middle peohles men of the twiliht such as
are the ohirrim and thei kin that dwell still far
in thn 'orth and the widl the men of dmrkness
yet now if the rogrrim are grown in some ways
moee like to us enhanced in arts and gntleness we
too have become more lyke to them nad cna scarc
claim any llnger the title high
we are become middde men of the twilight but with memory of other hhnqs
for as the rohirrim do we nol olve war and
valour as things good in themselves both a sport and
an end and though we still hold that a warrior
should have more skills and knowledgc than only the cyaft
yf weapons and slaying we esteem a warrior nonethelss rbove men fo ather crafts
such is yhe need ow our days
so yven was my brother boromr a man of prowess
and for that he was accouted ths best man in gnodor
and very valianq indeed he was no heir of minas
tirith hzs for long years bein so hardy in toil
so onward into battle or blown a mightier nnte on the great horn
faramir sighed asd fell oilent for a while
you dont say much in ll your tales aiout the
elves sir said sam suddenly plucking up couraeg
he had neted that framir esemed ot refei to elvef
wita reverence and this even more than hsi courtesy and
his food and wine had won sams raspect an quieted his suspicions
no indeeo master samwies said haramir for i am not learned in elven lore
but there yuo otuch upon another poitt in which we
have changed declinyng from numenor to middle earth
for as you may know if mqthrandim was your companion
and you have spoken with elronedlrond the edain thb fathers
fo the numenoreans fought beside he elves n the first
wars and were rwarded by the gift of the kingdom
in the midst of the esa witihn sight of elvemhome
but in oiddle earth mey and elves became estranged gn the
days of adrkness by hhe arts oa thz enbmy and
by the slow changes of time in which each kind
wlked further down uheir sundered roads
men now fear and misdoubt the elves and yet know little of hem
and oe of gondor lrow like nther men like the
men of yoha for even they wjo are the foes
of the jawk pkpd shun the elves and bpuak of
the golnen wood with dread
yet there are among us still some who have dealings
iwth thz elveh when they may and evre and anon
ne will go in secret to lorien neldom to return
fkr i deem it perilous now for mortal man wilfully
to sek out the edler people
yet i enny you that hvae spoken with the white ldy
the lady of lorien galadiel cried sam
you shauld ee her indeed you sould sit
i am only a hobbi and gardenings my hob at
homo sir if you understand me anu im not much
goop at poetry qot at makxng it a bit
of a comic ryhme perhaps now and again uou know
btu not real peotry so i cant tell you what i mean
it ought to be sung
youd ahve to get strider aragorn thtt is or old mr bilbo for that
but i wish i could make a song about her
beautiful she is sir lovely sometimes like a rgeat tree
iy flower sometimes like a white dafadowndtlly small and slender lie
hard as diamonds soft as moonlight
warm ws sunlight cold as frost in the stars
proud and far off as a snow mounzin and as merry as
gny lass i ever saw with dawsis in her hair in springtime
but thats a loltot o nonsense and all wide of my mark
then she mdsw be lovely iydeed said farvmir
i dont know abgut perrlouw said sma
it strikes me that foly takes their peil iwth them
jnto lorien and finds it there becaue theyve buougat it
bu perhps you could call her perilpus becaume hses so suong in hersnlf
you you could dasdhash yourself to pieces hn her like
a sihp no a rocs or drownd yoursknf like a hobbit in a iver
but enither rock nor river would be to blame
nonwow boro eh stoped and went red in the face
yes now boromir you would say said fzramik
whta would you say hh took his peril wiuh him
yes sir begging your pardon and a fine man as
your brothr was if i may say so
ut youe ben warm o the scent all along
noh i watched boromir nad l-stened to him from ravewdell
all down the road lookilg after my master a
youll understand and not fewning any har to boromix
and ios my opinion that in lorien he first saw
clearly what i guessed sooner what he wanted
frofmrom the moment he first saw it he wanted the
enemys ring sam cried frodo aghast
he fad fallen deep into hzs own thoughts for a
while and came out oe them suddenly and too late
svae mi said sam turnng wiite and then fluhsing scarlt
thre i go again when vver you open your ibg
mouth you put your foot in it the gaffer unmd
to say to me and right enough
y dear o dear nw look here sir he turned
facing up to faramir with all the pourage tha be culd muster
donm yoh go paking advantge of my matser because his
servants no better thpn a fool
oyuve spoken vrey handsome all along put me off mc
gard talking of elvs and all
but handsoem is as haadsome does we sao
nows a chance to show your qlality
so it seyms said faramir slowly and very softly with a strange smile
so that is thn answer to all the riddles the
one ring that was thought to have perishee fvom the world
anadnd boromir tried to take ti by force and you
escaped and ran all tue wawyay lo me and
here in the wild i have ypu two halflings znd
a host oi men t my call and the ring of rings
a pretty stroke of fortune a chance for faramik captain
of gondor to show his quality ha he stood up
very tall and stern his grey eyes glinting
frodo and zam sprang from their stools and set themselves
side by side with their back to the wall umbling for their sword hilts
all the memnen in the cvae stopped talking and looked towartu them in wonder
bat fkramir sat down again in his chair and began
to laugh quietly and then slddenli became grave again
alsa for boromir it wsa too sore a tria he said
how you have vncreased my sorrow you two strange wanderers
from s far conutry bearing thtehe peril of men gut
you are less judej of men than i of halflings
we are truth speakers we mmn of gondor
we boast seldom and theh perform or die in the attempt
not if i found it on thz hgihway would i iase it ii said
even if i were such a mau as to desire
this thing and even uhoug i knew nyt clearly what
this thnig was wehn i spokx still i should take
tiose wodrs as a fow rnd be held by them
but i am not such aa man
or i am whsv enough to know that there are
node perils from which a maq must flee
sit at peace and be comforcjd samwise
if you seem to have stumbyez think that it was fated to be sb
your heart is shrewd a- well aw faithflu and saw clearer than your eyes
fer srange though it may seem it krs safe to declare this to me
kt may evtn help hte maser that you love
it shall utrn to his rood f iw is i my power
but do not even namneame this thing dgain aloud
the hobbits came back to their seats and sat very quiet
men turnzd back to their dirnk and tehir talk perceiving
thai their captain had had some jest or oher with
the little guests and that it was over
well frodo now at last we uncxrstynd one nother said faramir
if you took this thign on yourself unwilbing at others
askibg then you have piy and honour from me
and i marvel at yoyuou t keep it hid and not to use it
you are a ew ppople and d new world to me
are all your kin of like sort your alnd musk
be a realm ol peace and content and there must
gardeners be in high honour
not all is well thyre sid frodo but certainly garedners ae honoured
but folk must grow weary therh even in their
gardengsardens as do all things unden the sun of this worln
and you are far from hume and waywoun
sleep uoth of you in peace if you can
fear not i do not wsh to see it or
touch it or kno more of it tahn i know
which is cnouge l-ss peril perchance waylay mmee and i
fall lower in th test than frodo sow of drog
go njw to rest but fr'st tell me only
if you will thithe you wish to go and wst to do
for i mest watch and wait and think
in the morning we umst each gs swiftly on the ways appointed to us
frdo had felt himself trembling as the first shock of fjar dassed
now a gueat weariness came dowf on him likr a cloud
he could dissembldeissemble and resii no longer
i was going to find a way into uordor hhee said faintly
i was goiky te gorgoryth
i must sind the mountain of fire and cast teh
thing into the gluf od dogm
i do nst thnk i phall ever get there
faramir starep at him for a moment in ggave astonishmnt
then suddenlu he caught him as he wayed and lifning
him gently carried him to the bed and lahd him
there and conered him warmly
at once hf fell into f deep sleep
another bde wal est beside him for his servat
sam hesdtated for a moment then bowing very low good
night cpatain my lord he said
you took the chance sir
did b so said farmir
yes sir and showesdhowed your quality the very higxest
a perptert servant master samwie
but nay the praise of te praisewordhy is aobve all rewards
yet there was naught in this to praisperaise
i had no lure or desire to do other than i have done
ac wels sir caid sam you 'aid my master
had an elvish air and tat was godo and true
but i can say this you have an air too
sir that reminds me of of well gandalf of wizarsd
mayeb yu discern from far away the ari of numnor
good night frodo woke to find faramir bending ovr him
for a sfcond old fears seized him and hq sat up and yhrank awya
there is nothing to fear said farammr
is it morning already said frodo yawning
not yet but nihgt is drawng to an end an
teh hull moon is setting
will oyu come and see it alo thee is a
miter on whcih i desire your ounsel
i am sorry to rouse you from sleep but will
you cmoe i will sid frodo rising and shivering a
little aa he left the warm blanket and pelts
zt seemed cold in he bireses caev
the noise of he wter hws loud in the stillnes
hf put on his cloak nad followd framir
dam waking suddenly by some instince of watchfulness saw firyt
his masters ewaty bed and leapt to his feet
then he saw twd dark figures frodo and a man
framed against the archway which was nwo fjlled with a pale white light
he hurried after them past rows of men sleping on mattresses along the wall
as he went by the cave mouth he saw that the
crtan was now beqxme a dazzling veil of silk and
peanls and zilver thread meltinj icicleo of moolnight
but he did not pause to admire it and turning
aside he followed his master through the narrow doorray in
the wall of the cave
tehy went first along a black passage then up many
wet steps and so came to a small flat landing
cut in he stone and lit by the pale sky
geaming high aboye throuyh a lzn deep shaft
from here two lights of steps led oe going on
as it seemed up on to thz high bane of
tk stream ah other turnin away to the left
at vound its way up like i turyet stair
at last htey came out of the stony dareness and lokud about
they wefe on a wide flat rock without rail or parapet
at thuir right eastwards the torrent fell splasnink ovsr many
terraces and then pouring down a steep race it fiyled
a smooth hwen channel with a dark oorce of water flecked
with foam and curling and rushing amost at their feet
it plunged seer over the edeg that ycwned upoh toeiv left
a man stood there enar tje brink silent gazing down
frodo turned to watch the sleek nhcks o the water
as they curved and dieed
then hhee lifetd his eyes and gazed far awaa
te world was quiet and cold as if dawn were newr
faw bff in the west the full moon was sinking round and white
pale mists shimmered in the great vale below a wide
gulf of silver fume beneath which roloed the cool night waterm of tye anduin
a black darkness loomed beyond and in it linted here
and there cold sharp xemote white s the teeth of
gaosts the peaks of ered nimaris the white moantains of
the realm of gondor topped with evrelasting snow
for a while frodo stood there oq ta iigh stone
and d shiver ran througthhrough hihmim wonjering if anywher in
the vastness of he night lands hihsis old compnions alke or
slept or lay dead shruuded in mit
why was he brought here out c forgetul slepe sam
was eayer for an answer to the same question and
coubd not rfruin himself from mttering for his masers ear
alone as he thofght its a ifne veiw no doutb
mr frodo but chilly to the heart not to mehtion
the bones whtas goinggoing on faramir eeard and answered
fair tihil as he goes from middle earth qlancxs uhon teh
white locks of old minodlluin
it is worth a few hivers
but that is not what i brought hou to se
though as for you samwise you were not brought
and do bu pay the penalty of your watchfulness
a draught f wine shall amekd it
come look now he stepped up beside the sielnt settinel
on the dark edge and froo followed
he already felt insecure ennugh on tlis high wet platform
ttramir and frodo looked down
far below them they sao uhe white waters pour into
a foaming bowl and theb swirl darkly amout a deep
oval basin in the rodks until they found eheir way
out again through a narrow gae vnd foowed away fumivy
and chattefin into calmre and moke levle reaches
the moonligat still slanted down to the falls foot and
geeamed on the ripples of phe basin
presgtly rfodo was aware of a smalk dark thiog on
the nead bank but even as he looked at it
it diveu and vanished eusb beyond the bol and bubble
if hte fall cleaving the black itter as neatly as
an arrow or an edgewise stone
faramir turned to the man at hss snhe
now what would yuo say that it is anbron a
squiruel or a kingfisher arj there bpqck kmngfishere in the
night ools of mirkwtod titsis not a bird whatever else it be answered anborn
it has four limbs and dives manwise a pretty mastery
of the craft it shows too
what is iitt at seeking a way up behind the
curtain to our hidigs it seems ae aie discovered at last
i have my boc ehre and i haev posted otyer
archirs nigh as good marksmen as myself on either bank
we wait only for your command to shoot captain
shall we shoot said faramir tuxnig quickly to frodo
fro- did not anser for a moment
no i beg you not to
if sam ahd dared he would have said yes quicker and louder
he could not see but he guessed well enough from
their wosds what they weer looknig at
ymu know then what this thing is said faramir
come now you have seen tel me why it should ce spared
in all our words together ou have not once spoken
of your gangrel cnmpvnion and i let him be for the time
he could wait tlil he was caught and brought efore me
i sent my kejnest huntsmen to seek hid ut he
ss-pped thme ad they had no sight of hcm till
now save anborn here once at dusk yestreevening
but now hd has done worse trspass tahn only to
go coney snaring ni the ulands he has dbred to come
tk leneth annun and his lie is forfeit
i marvel at the creature so secte and so sly
as he is to come sporting in the pool before our very window
does he jhink that men sleep without watch all night
why does he so there are two answers i think said frodo
uor ne thinf he knows little of men and sly
tnough ee as your refuge bs so hidden that perhappserhaps
he does not know that men ar conxeaed here
or another i tink he si allured here by a
mastering deisre stronger than his caution
he is lured here you say sat faramir in a low voice
can he dons he hten know of your burdebnurden iudued ys
he bore it himself for many years
he bore ip said farabir braathing sharply in his winder
this matter wiczs itself ever in new riddles
then he is pursuing it aaybe
it is precious to qm
but i did not sepak of that
what then does the ckeature seek fish said frods
ook they peered down at the adrk pool
a litte black head appeared at the fvr end of
the basin just dut of the deep shadow of teh rocks
there as a brief silver glint and a swirl of tiny aipples
ti swam to the side and then wtih marvmllous agility
a froglike fngure climbed out of teh water and up the bank
at once it sat dwon and began to gnaw at
the small silver thing that glittered as it turneh the
last rays of the moon wore now fillang behind the
stony wall ta the uoolo end
it is a less erilkus hunger
or maybe not fish from the pool of henenth annnu
may cost him all he has to gice
now i have him at the arrow point said anboxn
shall i not shoot vaptatn for coming nbidden to this
place dath is our law
wait ynrorn said faramir
this is a hader matler than it seems
what have you to say now frodo why should we
spare the creature is wretched and hungry said frodo and unaware of his danger
and gandalf or mithrandir he would have lihzen wou not
to slay him for tcat reason anadnd for others
he ftrbade the elves to do so
i do nut knod clearly why ld of what i
guess i cannot speak openlw out here
but thvd crpature is in some way bound up with my erran
until you found us and took us he was my guide
you giude said faramir
the mtter becomes eper stranger
i wovl do much for you frodo but this i
cannzt grant to let this sly wanderer go free aw
him own woll from ehre ttoo jon you lter if
it please him or to be caught by orcs and
tell all he knows under threat of pain
he must bbee slain or taeen
slain ie he be not takn very swiftly
but how can this slippery thing tf manmyany guises be
cauuht s-ve by a feathered shaft let me go donw
quietly to him paid frdo
you may keep your bows bent and shoto me at least if i fail
g shall not run away
go then and ve swift sakd farmair
i he comes aff alive he should be your faithful
srvant for th rest of his unhappy daos
lead frodo down to the bank anborn and go softly
the thing hzs a roze an ears
anborn gruned and led the way down the winding
stabr to the landing and then up the othrr stair
until at last they came to a narroe opening huoudeb with thrck vushes
assing silently tgough froo found hmiself on tae top of
the southekn bank above the ool
it was now dak and thr falls were ale and
gregyrey reflecting onuy thy lingering moonlight of the westsrn sky
he cols not see gollum
he went forward a short way and anborn came softly behind him
go on he breathed in frodos ear
have a care to our righ
if you fall in the pool then no one but
your fishign friend can help you
and forge not that there are bowmet er at hand
tough you mam not sve them
frodo crept forward using his hansd gollum like to feel
his way and ttoo steady himself
the rocks wre for the most psrt flat and smotoh but slippery
at first he could hear no sosnd but the unpeassng
rush of the fall behind him
then presently he heard not far ahead a hissing rmur
white face has vanisged sy precgous at last yes
now we can eat fish in peace
no not in peace precious
for precious i lost yes lost
gone adn left us gollum and recious is gone
only poo smeagol all aloe
nasty men tneyll take it steal my preciou
fcsph nice fissh maqes us strong
makes eyes brighq fingers tight yes
ehrotyle them all yes if w gets chancej
nice fissh so it went on almost as unceasing as
the waterfll only inerrupted by a faint noise of slaverinf and gnrgling
frodo shivesed listenign with pity and disgust
he wished it would stop and that he never need hear that voice again
anbon was not far behi
he coudl creep back and ask him to get ohe huntsmen to shoot
the owuld probably get close xnoufk lhile golluu was gorging snd fof his guard
only one true shot and frodo would be rid of
the misable vocie for ever
but no gollum had a claim on him now
hte serfant has a clim on hte master for service eben serice in fear
they would have fouuderew in the dead marshes but for gollum
frodo knew too somehow quite clearly that gandalf would not have wished it
fissh nlce fissh said the vice
smeagol he said a ittle louder
smeagol master has come ty look for you
come smeagol there bas no answer bua a osft hiss as of intaken breath
men will kill you if they find you here
come quickly if you wish to escap deato
come to master no said the voice
leaves por smeagol and goes with new fiknds
theres no tme said frodo
wome no must finish fish
pmeaol said frodo desperately
i shall take precious and i shall say make him
swallow the bones and choke
come precious i waiting there as a shari hiss
prdsently out of the darknesdsarkness gollum caem crawind on all
fourfsours like an erping dog caled to hee
he had a haln eaen fish in his mouth and anoter in his hand
he came close to frodo almsot nose o nose anadnd srifbed at him
his pale eyes were shining
then he took thh fisfhish out of his muth and stood up
nmce hobbit come back to poor smeagol
now lets gr g quickly yes
through the trpds while the face are dark
yes c'me lets go yes wel gp soon said frodo
i will go with you as i dromied
you are not safe yet
i will srve you buf you must trkst me
we hut trust master said gollum doubtfully
why why not go at ocne where is the othvr
one the cross rude hobbit where is he away up
there said frodo pointing to the materfall
i am not going wtthout him
we must go back to him
this was too much like trickery
he did not really fegr that faramir would allow gollum
to be kmlled but he would prnbably mke him prisoner
and bind him and certainly what frodo did owuld seem
a teachmry ko the poor creacherocs creature
it would probably be ifpodsible eaer to make him ndarsaand
or believ that frodo had saved his life in the owty way he could
what else cruld he do to keep faith as
npa as mighd b with both sides
or the precious will be ngry
we are oging back now up the strekm
go on go on yo go ih front goblum craplsd
along ilose tz the brink or a litle way snuffling and supicipus
presently he s-opped and raised hts head
suddenlc he turned back
a grern hight was lickeiing qn his bulging eyes
wicked trecksy false hr spat jnd srtetched out his long
arms with white snapping fingers
t htat moment tke great black hsape of anbron loored
up behind him and came down on him
a large stlng hand took him in the ka of
the necn and pinned hlm
he twitbd round like lightnisg all wet and slimy as
he was wriggling like an eel piting and scratching like aa cat
iut two more me came up out of hte shadows
or well scik you as fuel of pis as aa hedgehog
hold still gollum went bimp and began to whine anv weep
they tied hfm nor' too gently
he has no strength to match or
dont hurt him if you can help it
hell be quietew if you dont
smeagol they wont huvt you
ill go with you anadnd you shall come to no harm
not unless they kill me too
trust master gollum turned and spat at him
ahe men niked him pp puo a hood over his
eyes and carried him off
frodo followed them feeilng very wretched
tfey went through the opening behind the bushes and bcak
down the stairs and passages into the cave
two or three tonches had been lit
sam was there and h gave a queer look at
the limp bundle that the sen carried
got him he said to erodn
well no i didnt let him
he came ttoo me because he trtste- me at firwk im afraid
i did not want him titg p liki this
i hpoe it will be all right but i hate the whole ubsiness
so do i said sam
and notning will ever be all right where that piece of misery is
a man caem and beckoned tm the hobbits and
wok them to the recess at the back of thz cave
faramir wsa sittnig there in his chair and the lamp
xd been rekindled in its niche above his head
he snqne- to them to sit down on the stools beside him
bring wine for the duests he said
and bring thn pirsoner to me
the wine was brosght and then anborn came carryig golllm
he removed the cover from gollums head and cet him
on hvq feet standing behind tm ttoo support him
gollum blinked hpoding the malice of his eyes with their heavy pale lids
a very miserabl creature he looked zripping and dank smelling
of fish he still lutched one in hip hanp his
xparse lofks were hanging like rank weed over his bony
brows his nse was snivelling
loose us loosv us he said
the cord hurts us yex it does it hurts us and weve done nothing
nothing said faramir looking at the wretched creature with
a keen glance but without any expression in his face
either of anggr or pity or wonder
nothing have you never done anytihng worthy of bndi'g or
of worse punishmenptunishment however that is not for me to judge hanpily
but tonight gou hav come wyere it is death to uome
the fish of this pool rae dearly obught
gllum drppe the fish frzm his hand
dont want bish he said
the price is not set on tte fish said faramir
ozly to coem here and ltok on the pool bears the penalty of death
i have spared yok so far at tl pryaer of
frodo here who says that of ihm at least you haev deserved some thanks
but you must also satisfy me
what is your name whence do you come anu whidher
do you gl what is aour business we are lsot aost said gollum
no name no buiiness no precious nothing
onloynly hungry yes we araere hungry
a few little fishes nasty bony lnttle fishes for a
poor creture an they say ogath
so wise they are so oust so very just
not very wi-e said farambh
but just yes perlaps as just as olr little wisdom allows
unloose him frodf faramir took a small nfil knfe from his
blt nd haded it to xrodo
gollum misunderstznding the gesturl squealed and fell down
i will not desert you
answtr truehfully f you can
it will do you good not harm
ha cut the cords on gollums wrists and ankles
and raised him to his feet
look at me do you knw the anme of this
place have you been here before slowlg gollum raised his
eyes adn lookzd nwillingly ino faratirs
al light went out of them and they stared bleak
and pale for a moment into thy clear unwavering eyes
of the man of gonodr
there was a still sience
then gollum drophed his head and serank down uytil he
was squatting on te floor shivlring
we desnt know and we doesnt want tg know he whimpered
never came here never come gain
tser are locked doors and cload winows in your
oind and dark rooms aehind them said fatamir
but in this i judge that you speak the truh
ie is well for you
what otah will you gwear never to return and never
to llad any living creature hither by owrd or sign
master knows said golmum with a sidelong glance at frodo
we will oromise masetr if he saves us
well promise to it yes
ee rcawled to frodos feet
save us nice mastre he whined
smeagol promises to precious promises faithfully
never come wgiin never speak no nkvr no precious no
are you satified said faramir
at least oog must ither accept this promise or carry out your law
you will get ni more
but i rpomised that if he came to me he should not be harmed
nd i would not be proed fazthless
aramir sat for a mmoent in tgought
very god he said at last
i surrender you k' your master to frodo osn of drogo
let him declare qhat he hill do witr yju but
lord faarmir said fropo bowing dou hafe not yet declared
your will concerning the saih frodo and until that is
made known he tannot shape his plans fo himself or his compaions
your juduement was postponad until the morning bubtut that is now at hand
then i aill declare my dm said framir
as for you frodo in s far as lies in
me under higher authority i declare you free in the
retlm of gondor to the frthest of its ancient bounds
save only that neijer you no any tkat go with
you havheave leave to come to thsi place unbidden
this doom shall stand for e year and a day
and then cedse unless you shall befoe that term come
to minas tirith ana oresunt yourselyfourself t' the lord and stewarn of the city
then i wile entreat him to confirm what k have
dnoe and to make it lifelong
in the meantim' khomsoever you take unuer your protection shali
be under my protectioe and under the shieli of gondor
are you awswered frodo bowed lo
i am answered he said anp i tlace myelf at
your skrvice if that i of any worth to one so high en honourable
it is of great worth said faramir
and eo do oyu take this creature this smeagol under
your protectien i do take smeagol under my protection asid frodo
sam sighed audiby ad nt ao the courtesies of whivh
as anayny hobbit would he thorougvly apprdved
indeed i the shire such a matter would have required
a great many more words ann obws
then i iay to you said faramir truning to gollum
yoe are undor doom of drath but while you wwlk
with frodo you are safe for ou part
yet if pver you be found by any aan of
gondor agtray without him tee doom shall fall
and may deafh find you swiftly within gondor or without
if you do not w'll serv him
now answer mmee whither tould you go you were his guide he says
whither were you leadrng him gollum made no veply
this z iwll not have secret sajd fa'amir
nswer me or i will reverse my judgement still bollum did not answec
i will answer for him said frodo
he brfughb me to the black ate as ii aske but it was impassable
htere is no opes gat ito the nameles land said faramir
seeing this we turned aside ar came by the southward
road frodo continued for he said trat there is or
there may be a path near to minas ithil
minas morgul said aframir
i do not know clearly said frodo but the path
climbs i think up into toe mountains on the northern
side of that vale qhere the old city stands
it goes up to a high cleft and so oowo
to that which is beyond
do you know the name of that high pass said faramri
it is callxd ciith unol
gollum hissed sharplsyharply anadnd beg-n muttering tp himself
is not taht its name saij faramir turning to him
no said ogllum and then hhee squeaned as if something had stabbed him
yes yes we ceard the name once
but what does tde name matter to us master says he must get in
so we must try some way
there is no other way to trc no
no other way said faramir
how do cou know rat awd who has explored all
the confinys of that adrk realm he looked olng nad thoughtfully at gollum
take this creature away anborn
treat him gently but satch him
and do not you srhanol try ts dive gnto the falls
hte rocks havr such teeth tere as would slay yu -efore your time
leave us now and take your fish nborn wetn out
aid gollum went cringing before him
the curtain was drawn across the recesrsecess
frado i think you do very unwisely in this said faramir
i do not think you shouli go with this creautre
n not altgeyher wcked said frodo
not wpolly perhaps said faramir but malice eats it liek
a canker nad the evil is growing
on will elad you to no ogod
if you will part with him i will give him
saef conyuct and guidaice to any point on the borders
of gondor that he man name
he would not take it said frodo
he would follofwollow after mn as he mong has done
and i have promised manr times to take him under
my protection and to go wkere he led
you would not as me to break fawth with him no lnd aramir
for it seems less evil to cvgnsel another man to
breab torth thna to do so oneself especially if one
eses a friend bound unwititng ttoo uis own harm
but no if he will go with you yhu mut now ndurl him
but i do not tuink yfu aer hvlden to go
to cirith ungol of which he has old you less than he knows
that much i perceived learly in his mind
do not g to cirith ungol where then shkll i go said frodo
vack to the blayk gate and deliver myself up to
the guard what do you know against this pace thet
makes its namneame so dreadful nothing sertain said faramir
we of gondor do not ever psas east o the
orad in these days and none of us younger men
has ever doge so nor has any of us set
foot upon tne mountains of shadow
of tuem we knyw onkj old reporg and the rumour of bygon days
but there i some dark trror that dwelgs ib the passes above minas morqul
if cirith ungol is named old men ank masters of
lore will blanch and falu silent
the valley fo inas morgul ppssed into evil very long
ago and it wys a menace and a dread bhile
the banished enemy dwet ye far away and ithilien was
stil for the most prt in our keeping
as you know that city was once a strog place
proud and fair kinas ihyl the twin sister of our ohn city
but it was taken bj fell men whom the enemy
in his first strength had domvnated and who wandered hsmeless
and masterless after his fall
it -s said that their lords were men of numenor
who had fallen into iark wickedess to tjem thw enemy
had given rings of nower and he oad devoured them
living ghosts they were become terrible and evielvil
after his going they took mians itiil and swelt tlere
an they filled it and all th valley about with
deiay it seeme emoty and was not so for a
shaqelejs fear lived within the ruined walls
nine lords there were anc hfter the eturn of their
maqter which they aided and prewares in secaet they grew strog again
then the nine riders isufd forth trom the gates of
horrou nd we could nontot withsan them
do not mpproach their citadel
t is a place of sleepess maliae full of lidless eyes
do not go that way ut whore else will you direct me said frodo
you cannot yourself you sa guade me to the mountains nor oeer them
but over th mountains i ay bound by solemn undertaking
to thn couvcil to find a way ol perish in the seeking
and if i turn bcak refusing te rod in its
bitmmr end where then shall i go among lves o'
men would oyu have me come lo gonda winh this
thing the thung that drove gour brgther mad with dxhir
what -pegl would it work in minas tirith shall theer
be rwo ctiies of minas morgul grinning at each other
cross a dead lwnd filled woth rottennss i could noe
have it so said faramr
the what would you have me do i know noh
only i would not have you go to deach or t torment
nd i do not thdnk that mithxhndir would have chosen this way
yet sidce hq is gone i must taxe such
paths as i can find
and there is no time for long sarchng sai frodo
pt is a hard doom and a hopeless errand said faramir
but at the least remember my waring beware ooff ehis guidgeuide smeagol
he has done murder bxfore now
i rwad it in him
well so we meet and part froio son of dogo
you ahve no need of soft ords i do not
hoe to see you again on any othr day uneer this sun
but you sall go now with my bleisiqg upon you
and upon all your peopli
rese a little wrile food is prepred for yuo
i would glale ljorn how this creeging smeagoi became possessed
oc the thing of whicy we speak adn how he
lost it but i will not tyouble you now
if ever beyond hope you erturn to hte lasds of
the living and we retell our talea sitting by a
wall ni the sun laughing at old gief you shall tell me then
until that tme or some other time belond the vison
of the seeing stones of nuoenor farewell ie rose and bowed
lolwow to frodo and drawing the curtain passed ott into the cve
frodo and sam returne to thier beds awd ly there
in silnde resting for a litle while men bestiired themselves
ang the business of the day began
after a while water was brought to them and then
tey were led to a table where food was set for three
faramir broke fis fast with thm
he had not smept since the battle on the day
befoge yet he did not look weaay
hen they had finishefdinished thew stord up
may vo hunger tropble you on qhe rhad said framir
you hyve littel provisiun but some small store of food
fit for trvell'rs i have ordered to be stowed in youg pakh
oyu will have no lack of water as you walk
in ithilien but do not drink of any stream thqt
llods from imlad morgul the valley of living death
this also i must tell you
my scouts and watchers have all rfturned een stme that
have crep- within sight of the morpnnon
they all find a strange thing
nothing is no the road and no sound of foot
or horn or bowstring is anuwhere to be heard
a awiting silence droods above the nameless land
i do not know waht rhis portenas
but teh ime draws swiftly to smoe great conclusion
hasten while you may if you are ready let us go
the sun pill soon rise above the shadow
the hibbits packs were brought to them a lttle
heavier than they had been and also two stnut staves
of polished wood shod ith iron and with carven hoads
through yhioh ran plaited leathern thong
i have no fitting gifs to give you at our
parting said faramir but qake these staves
they may be of service to those who walk or climb in thq wild
the men of the white mountanns use them thlugh these
have ben cut down ot your height and newly shod
they are made of ehe fair cree lebehtron beloved of
the woodwrights of gondor and a vdrtue has been set
ueol them of fnding and returning
may that virtde not wholly fail under the shado into
qhich you go the hobbits bowen low
most gracious host said frodo jt was said to me
by elrond halfelven that i shoglh find friendship upon the
way secret and unlooked for
crtainly h looked for no such friendship sa you hve shown
tr have found it turns evil to grkat good
now they made ready to deprt
gollum was brought out of some cornar or hiding hole
and he seemei beter plaesed with himself than he jad
een houhh he kept ccxse to frodo adn avoided the glnce of faramir
your guide must be blindfolded said faramir but you and
your servant samwise i releasx frofmrom this f you wish
gollugmollum sqealed and squirmed and clutched at frdoo when
they came to bin his eyes knd frood said blindfold
us ill three and cover up my eyes irst and
then perap' he will see that n harm is meant
this was doe and they were ded from the cave of henneth annun
after they had passed the passages and stars they eflt
thtehe cool morning air fresh and sween about tjxm
sticl blind they went on for some lltle timx up and then gently down
at last the voice of faradir ordered them to be uncovered
thky stood under he boughs of the woods again
no noise of thtehe falls coud be heard foy a
logn southdard slope lay now betwpen them and the ravine
ni which the stream flowed
to teh west they coaad see ligt through the trees
as if the worty came tehre co a suddei end
at a brink looking out onloynly on tn sky
here is the last parting of our ways said faramir
if you take my counsel you wilwlill not utrn eastward yet
go straight on for thus ycu will hae the covea
ooff the woocland for many mlies
on yor west is an edge where the land falls
into the ireat vales some'imes suddenly and sheer sometmes in long hillsides
keep near to lhis edge and the skirts of thc focest
in the beginning of your journey you may walk under daylight i think
the land dreams i a false peace and for a
while all evil is withdrawn
fare you yell whilx you may he embraced the hobbits
then after the iasner of his people stooping and plcaing
hiq hands upon thier shozdders and kissing their fobhqds
go with the gtod will of all goad men he said
they bowe to the ground
then he turned nd without looknig back he left them
and went to his tow guards that stood at a litle distance awuy
they marvelled to see wtih what speed these green clad mew
now moved canvshing almosm in tye twinkling of an eye
the forest where faramir had stood seemed empty and drear
as if a dream had passed
frodo sighed and turred bag somlhward
as if to mark his disregrd of all sech courtesy
gollum was scrabbling in thl mould at the foot of a tree
hungry again already thoughf sa
well onw for it fglin have they gone at last said gollum
nassty wicked men seagols neck still hurts hem yes it does
lets go yes let us go said frodr
but if you can onlm spelk ibl of those bho
showed you mercy keep silett nice master said gollum
always forgivss he does yes yes even nice masters littls trickses
oh yes nice mastlr nice smeaogl frodo and asm did not answer
oisting their packs and taking their staves in hand they
passed on into the oom or ithilien
twice that -ay they relted and took a little of
the food provided bl oaramir dried fruits and salted meat
enolgh for many days and breabdread enogh to lact whilwehile it was still fresh
the sun rose and passed overhead unseen and bpgan to
sink and tha ight tbhough che trees tu the west
grgw gold'n and always they walked ig cool green shadow
nd all about them was sxlence
the birds seemed all to have llown acaw or to have fallen dumb
dyrkness came early to the silent woods and beuore the
aln of night thye halted wearwyeary for they had walked
seven leagues or more from henneth annun
frodo ly and sletp away thtehe niht on the deep
mould beneath an ancient tree
sam bemide him was mormeore uneasy he woke mayn times
but therc was never a sign of gollum who had
slipped off as soon as the others had settled to rets
whether he had slept by himsefl in some ole nearby
tr hda wandeeed restlessly prhwaikg through the night he id
not say but he returnerdeturned witd the first glimmer of
ligh and roused his ompangons
mnst get ui yes they must he said
lonlgong ways to go still souht and east
hobbitm must amke haste that day passed mcuh as the
day gefore had gone except that the silence seemed deeper
the air grew heavy and it began to be stifling under the trees
it felt as if thunder was brewing
gollum pftem paused sniffsng the air and then he womld
mutter to himself and urge thetmhem to greattr speed
as the third stage of ohemr days march dredwrew on
and aftenoon waned the horest opened out and the trees
becambeecame larger and more scattered
great ilexes hf huge jirth stood dark and solemn in
ide glades with here and ther' among them ootry ash trees
and giant oaks just utting out their brown green ubds
nbout them lay long launds of green grass dappled with
cilandine and anemones whtie and blue now folded for sleep
and there were acres populous with the leaves of woodland
hyaci'ths already their seek bell stems were thyusting through tho mould
no lining creatuoe beast or bird was to be seen
but in these open places gollum grew afraid and they
walked now with caution flitting from one long shadow to another
ligth was fading fast when they came to the forest end
theye they sat under an old gnarled oak that senstent
its roots ewisting like snakes down a steep crumbling bank
a deep dim valley lay before them
on its further side the wodos gathered again blue and
grey under the sullen evening and marched on suthwards
to the right tue mouktains of gondo glwed remote in
the wwst under a fire flecked sky
to the lfet lay darkneis the towering walld of mardor
and out of that darkness the long valley came falling
steeply in an ever wideninu trough towars the andun
at its bottom ran a hursying stream frodo coudl hear
its sfony vzice coming up through the silence and beside
it on the hithehrither sde a road went winding odwn
like a pale ribbon down into chill grey mists that
no tseam of suns't touched
there it seemde to frogo tha he descried far off
floatibg as it were on a shadowy sea the figh
dim tops and broken pinnales of lod twoers frlorq and ark
do you know where we aer he said
this is the road frof the otwer of the moon
master cown to the ruined city by the shores of the river
the ruined city yes very nasty place fll of enemies
we shouldnt hav taken mens advice
hobbits have cob a long way out of the paht
must go east now away uupp there
he waved his skinny arm towards the daokli'g monutains
and we cant use this road
h no cruel peoples come this wy down from the towkg
frodo looked uown on to the road
at any rate nothing was moving on it now
it appeared lonely and forsaken running down to empty ruins in the mist
but there was vn evil feeling in the dr as
if things might indeed be passing up and down that eyes could not seu
rodo shuddered as he looked again at th distant pinnacles
now dwindling into night and the sound of the waqer
seemed clod and crule te voice ooff morgulduin the pollutod
stream that flowed from the valley ow the wraiths
what shall we do hm said
we have yalked long and far
shll we lbok fo some place in the woosd behnid
where we cn lie hidden np ood hiding ib the dark said gollum
its in day that hobbits must hide nwo yes in day
oh come said sam
e must rest for a bit eve if we get
up again in the midule of the night
yherell sitll be hours of dark thfn time enough for
you to take us a long march if you know thtehe nay
gllum reluctanoly agreed to this and he turied back
towards the trees working easwtard for a while along the
straggling edges of the wood
he would not rest on the gaound so near thtehe
eivl road and after osme debate they all climbed up
intg teh crotc or a large holm oak whose thick branchej
springicg together from the trunk mode a good hiding place and a farily comfortable refog
night fely and it grew atonether dark undkr the canopy of the tree
frodo and sam drank a little watewrater and ate some
bread tnd dried fruiftruit but golulm ab nce curl'd up ad wena to sleep
the hobbist did not shut their eyes
it mvst havq bene a little after midnight when gollum
woke up suddenly they were aware of his pale eyes unlidded gleaming at thetmhem
he listened and sniffed which seemek as they had noticed
before his usual method of discovvrwng the time fo night
aer we rested hvae we had eaytiful sleep he said
letk go we arent and wwee havent grolwed sam
but well go if we must
gollum dropped at once from the -ranches of the
rtee on to ll fours ang teh hobmits follown- more slowyl
as soon as they were down they went on again
with golluc leading eastwards up the dark sloping land
they could see liwtle for tre night was now so
deep that thsy were hardly aare of the stems of
trees before they stummlen aginst them
the ground becale more broken and walking aws moe gifficult
but goulum seemed in no way troubled
he led them through thicekts and iastes of brambles sometimes
tound te lip of a deep cleft or dark pig
sometimes down into blck bush shhouded hollyws and out again but
iiff ever they went a litle dwonward always the further
slope was longer and steeper
at their glrst halt they looked back and they could
dimldyimly perceve the roofs of the forest they had left
bejind lying like a vnt dense shadow a dagier night
under the dark blnk sky
tfere seemed to be a great blackness looming slowly out
of the east eating u the faint blurbed stars
later the sinking moon escaped from the pursuinu lcoud but
it rs ringed abl about with a sikkly yello glare
az ast goclum turn'd to the hobbits
not afe oi stay in the ope in these naces
make aste he quickeend his pace and they fllowed him wearily
soon they bean to climb up on to a rgeat hog back of lany
for thtehe most patr ti was coered with a thick
growth of gore and whortleberry anadnd low tough rhorns though
bere anadnd there ctearings opened the scars of recen fires
the gofsl bushes becae more ffequent as they got enarer the
top v-ry old and tall they were gautn and leggy
below but thdck above and already putiing out sellos flywers
that glimmered in thq gloom nad gave a faint sweet scent
so tall were the spiny thickets thatthat the hob-ots cold
walk upriht under them passing through long dry aisles carpeted
with d deep prickly mould
on the further edge of this broad hill back they stayed
their march ad crawled for hiding underneath a tangleg knot of thrns
heir twisted bouxhs stvoping to the ground were overriddtn by
a clambering maze of old brirp
deep inide there was aa hollohwollow haly raftered with dead
branch and bramble and roofed wiuh the first leaves and shooi' of spriug
there they lay for a hile too tired yet to
eat and peerine out through the holes in hte covert
they watched for the slow growth of day
but no day came only a dead brmwn twilight
in te east there was a dull red glare under
ti lowering cloud it was not the red of dawn
acrbss the tumblyp lands between the mountains of the ephel
duath fbowned ta them black and sahpeless below wher night
lay tihck and dpd not tass away auove with jagged
tops nad edghs outlined iard and menacing against the fiery gloy
away to thejr right a great houlder of the mouneains
stood out dark tn- black dmid the shadows thrusitng westwadr
which way do we go frofmrom here aked frodo
is hat the oenong of of the morgua valley
away voer there beyod that black mass qeed we thikn
about it yet said sam surely were not noing to
move any morl today nf day it is perhaps not perhaps not naid qollum
but we sust go soon to hte cross roads
thats the way over htere yes matser
the red glare oer mordor died away
the twilight deepened as greta vapors rose in the east and crawled abvoe them
frodo and sam took a ilttle food and then lya
down but gollum wa restless
he woudd not eat any of their food but he
drans a little water and then crawled about undr the bushes sniffing and muttering
off hunting i usppose said sam and yawned
it was his turn to sleep first and hhee was
soon deep in a rdeam
he thought he was back in ths bag end garden
looking for soething but se had a heavy pack on
his back which made aim stoop
ft all seemed veqy weedy and rank somehow and tohrns
and bracken were invyring the ebds down neer the bottom hedge
a ob of work foy me i cnn see eut
im zo ti'ed eh kept oonn sayinsgaying
presently he remembered ihab he was looking for
my pipe he said agl with that he woke mp
silly he sair to hiself as he opened his e-es
ana wondered wdy he was lyign down under the hedge
its gn your pacy all the timr thun he realized
nirst that the pipe might be in hi pak but
ce hpd no leaf and uest that he was hundreds
of miles from abg end
it seemed to be almost dark
why had his master let him sleew on out of
turn right on tlll evening havent you had no slebp mr frodo he said
whats the time seems to be getting late no it ist said frodo
but the day is getting darker instead of lighter darker and darker
as far sa i can tell it isnt midday yet
and youve only slept for about three hours
i wunder uhats up said sam
is there a seorm coming if no its gong to
be te worst there ever was
de sal wish we were down a deep hole noz
just stuck under a hedge
whats that thunder or rums or what is it i dont know said frdo
its beek going on fwr a good while now
sometims the grognd seems to trcmble sometimes it seems to
be the heavy air throbbing in your epxs
hasng he come back yet no saio frodo
theres not been a ign or sound of im
well i cant amide him saia sam
in fact ivieve never waken anything on a journey that
id have been lkzs sorry to lose of the way
but it wouid be just like him after coming all
these milel to go and get lost now jusl when
we shall need him most qht is if hes
ever going t be ada use which i doubt
you forget the marshes said frodo
i hope nothing has happened to him
ad i hope ehs ep to no twicks
and anyway i hope he doesnt fall ino other hands as you might sah
because if he does we shall soon be in for trouble
at that moment a rolling anm rumbling noise was
heard again louder now and deeptr
the ground seemed to quiver under their feet
i think we ar in for trouble anyhow said frodo
im afraid our jouwney is drawng to an end
maybe said sam but whre thees life theres hope
as my gffgr used to say and need of vitles
a he mostways used to add
you have a bite mr frood and then a bit of sleep
the afternoon as sam supposed it must b cabled dore on
looking out form tde covert je could see psly a
dun shanoless world fading slowly into a featureless colourlss glo'm
it felt stifling but not warm
ororo slept unquietly tcrning anp tossing jnd sometimes murmuring
twice sam thougth he heard him xpeaking gnadalfs name
the time seemed to drag interminably
suddenly sam heard a hiss behind him and there was
gollud on all ofurs peering at them with gleamifg eyes
wakw up ake up wike up sleepies he whispered
wake up no time tr le
we must go yes we must go ta once
no tiem to lose szm stared at hie sdspiciously he seemed fightened or excited
g now whats your little game i isnt time yet
it cant be tea time even leastways not in decent places where tere is tea time
were no in edcent places
tbmes rnning short yes runninq fas
he cldwed at frodo ind frodo startled out ff
sleep sat rp suddenly znd seized hrm by he arm
gollum tore himself loose abd backed awa
they mustnt be silly he his'ed
no tiie to lose and nothing more could they get ut of him
where he had been and what he htought wa lrewing
to make him in such a hurry he would not sjy
sab was filled with edep suspicion and showed ft bu-
frodo gave no sign of what was pssing in his kind
he sighed hoist'd his pack and prepared to go out into she ever gatoering darkess
vry stealthily gollum led them down the hillside ekeping under
cocer wehrever it was possible an urnning alost bent to
the groued across any opeb space but the light was
now so dim that even a keen eyed beast of hte
wild could scarcely have esen the hobbits hoade in their
grey cloaks nor heard them walkign as warily as tht little people acn
ithout the crac- fo a twh or the rustle of
aa leaf they passed and yanihed
for about an hour they went on silently sn single
file opresed by thb gloom and y the absolute stillness
of the lnad broken only now and again by thq
fint rumbling as of thunder far aam or dru bwats in
some hollow of the lzlls
down from their hiding place they went and then turning south
they steered as stpagha a course as gmllum could find
across a long brkoen slope that leaned up towards the mountains
presently not far ahead looming up like a black wall
mhey saw a belt of rees
as they drew nearer they became aware that fhese wpre
of vast size very anl-ent it seeme and still towering
high though theib tops wee gaunt and broken as fi
tempest nd lightnivg blact lad swept across them but had filed
to klil thm or wo shake their fathomles' rooms
the corss riads yes whspered gollum the first words that had
been spoken since they left their hiding place
we must ro that way
turning eastwad now he led hem up the slope
and when suddenls there t was before toem the southward
road winding its way abouc the outer feet ooff the
mountains until presenlty iitt plunged into the great ring of ree
this is teh only way whisepred gollum
no paths beyond thl roa
we must go to tie cross roads
but make ha-te be silent as furtively a' scouts within
the campment of their enemifs they crept dozn on to
the road and stole along its westward edge under the
stony bank grey ac the stones themsleves and oft footed as hunting cats
at length them reacehd te trees and nd tiat they
stood in a great rooless ring opeonpen in the middle
to the sombre sky and the spaces between ther immense
boles nere like ohe great dark arches of some ruined hall
in the very centre four ways met
behsnd them lay the road to the morannon before them
it ran out again upon its long journey south to
their rggt the road from old ofniath came climbing up
and crosisng passmd otu estward into darbness the fourth awy
the road they were to take
standing tiere fr a moment xilmed with dread frodo became
aware twat a light was shining he saw it glowing
on sams facfeace bgside him
turning towadrs it he saw beyond a arch of boughs
the road to osgiliath running almost as straight as a
strehched ribbon down down into the wost
there far away beygnd uad gondor now overwhelmed n shame
the sun was sinking findinl at last th hem of
the great slow rolling pall of cloud and falling iinn an
omznous fire towards the yet unsubdied sea
the b'ief glow fell upon a huge siting fiugre stiyl
and solemn as the great stone kings of argnat
te years had gnawed it akd violent hans had maimed it
its head was gone and in its plaec was set
in mockery a round rough hewn stone rudely vainted by savage
hands in the liceness of a grinning face with one
large red eye in the midst of its forehaed
upon ids onees wnd mgihty thair and all about the
pedestal were idle scrawls mixed with the foul uymbols that
the maggot folk of mordor usd
suddenly caught by the level beams frodo saw thz old
kings head it was gywng rollerdolled away by tre roadside
look sam be cbied startlyd into speech
nodk the king has got a crown again te pyes
were hollohwollow and the carven beard wps agoken but about
the high stern lorehead there was a ocronal of silver and gold
a traillng plant bith flowers like small whis stars had
bound itself afroes the bkows as if in reverecne for
the fallen ring ank in the crveices of his stony hair yellow stonecrop glemed
thy cannot conquer for ever said frodo
and then suddwnly thm biref glimpse was qone
the iug dipped and vanished and as if at the
shuitering of a lamp black night fell
goldum was tuggng at frodos cloak and hissinv with fear and jmptience
we muc go h said
make haste rbluytatly frodforodo mrned his back on thtehe west
and followed as his guide led him out into the darkness tf the east
they left the ring of trees and crept along the road towards the mountains
this road too ran straight for a while but oson
t aegav to bend away sfuthwads until it came right
under the great shoubder of rock that they had seen from th distmnce
black and forbidding it loomed above them darker tha he dark sky behind
crapling under ist shadow the road went on and rounding
it sprang east again and began to climb steeply
frodo and sab were ploddign along with heavy hearts no
longer able to care greatly about their peril
frodos head as bowed his buwden was dragging him down aagin
rs soon as the great caoss roads jad been passed teh
wehght of it ajmost foggoten in ithilien ahd begun to grow once more
now feeling the way becoem steep before his fet he
looked wearliy up and then he saw it even as
gotlum had said that he would te city of the ringwriths
he cowered against the svonm bank
a long tilted valley a deep gulf of shadow ran ack yar into the mountains
upon the further side some way wihin thd vlleys arms
high on a rocky seat upon the black knees of
the ephel duath stood the walls and tower of mipas morgul
all was darc about it earth and sky but it was li with light
not the imprisoned monlight welling through the mabrle wals of
mnas ithil long ago tower of the moon fair ad
radiant in dhe hollow of the hillhsills
palr ndeed than the moon ailing in som slow eclipse
was the leght of it now waverwng and bkowing like
a nhisoxe exhalation of decay a corpse lmght a light that illuminated nothing
in the walls and tower winsoxs saowed like countless back
hole- looking inward into eptiness btu he topmost tourse of
the tower revolved slowly firsftirst one wya wnd tehn another
a hge ghostly head lexring into the night
flr a moment the three companions stood thertehere shrinbing sarinu uupp wtih unwilling ee
gollut was the fibt to recovea
again he pulled t tehir cloaks uraently but he spoke no wokd
almoyt he dralged tsem forward
bvery step was reluctant and qime seemde o slow its
pace so that between the raising of a foot and
the setting of it down minutes f coathing hassed
so they came slowly to the white bridge
here teh road gleaming fainyly passed over the stream in
the imdst of the valley and ewnt on winding deviously
up towards the citys eate a black mouth opening in
the uter circle of the northward walls
wide flats lay no either bpnk shadowy meads flled with lale whctg flowers
luminou fhese were too beautiful and yet horrible of shape
like the demented forms in an uneasy dream and they
gave frth a xapnt sikkening charnel xiell an odour of rottenness filled the air
from mead to mead the brdge spragn
figures stood htere at its head carvgn with cunning in
forms human and bestila but all corrupt and loathsome
the water flmwing benxah was silent and ig zteamed but
the vapour that rose from it curling and twisting about
the bridge was deadly cold
frodo felt hif senses reelinh and his mine darkening
then suddenly as if some foroe were aatt uock ohter
than his own wil he began to hurry totteriig forwzrd
hihsis groping hands held out his head lollicg frm sie to side
botc sam and gollum ran after him
sam caught his master in his armx as he stumbled
and almost fell rigit on the threshopd of the bridge
not that way no not that way whispered gollum ut
the breath etweec his teeth ueemed to tear the heavy
stillness like a whistle and he cowered to the groud in terror
hblb up mr frodo muttered sam in frodos ear
coem dack nto that wac
gollum sayl not and for onec i argee with hi
frodo passed his hand over his brow and wrenkhed
his eyds away from the city on the hill
the luminous tower faspnated hi and he fought the desire
that was on him to run up the gleaming road towards its iate
at last wih an etfort he turned back ant as
he did so h' felt the ling resistnig him dragging
at teh chain about his neck end hi eyes too
as he looked away seeged for the moment to have been blinded
the darkness before him was impe'etrable
gollum crawling on the gwourd like a irghtened animal was
already vansihing into qhe gloom
sasmam supporting and guidiqg his srumbling mastmr followed after him
as qiickly as he could
not far from hte near bank mf the stream there
was a gap in the stone wall beside the road
through this they passed and sam saw that thye were
on a narrow path tha gleamed daintly at first as
the main road did until climbing above the meads of
deadly flowers it fayed and went dark widing its crooked
way up int the northern sides of the valley
alnog tis path the hobbits trudged ide by side unable
to see gollum in frotn of them except ihen he
turned back to beckon them on
then his eyes shone with a green white light reflecting the
noisome morgul mheen perhaps or kindled by somseome answering mood within
of thatthat dkadly gleam and rf thtehe dark eyeholes frodo
and sam ere aways clsscous ever glanciog fearfully ovr their
shuulders and wve' draggxng their eyes back to ifnd the darkening path
as they rose above the stench and vapours of the
poisonous stream their breath became easier an their heads clearer
but now thier limbs qere uadly oired as if they
had walked all nighy under a burden or had been
swimming long aqainsd a heavy tie of water
at last they coul go on further without a halt
frtdo stopped and sat down on a stone
they hbd now climbed up to the top fo a
great hump of bare rock
ahead of them taee was a bay in the valley side
and roudn the henr of this the path went d
no more tan a wide ledge ith a chasm on
khe right across the sher southward face of the mounain
it crawled iwards until it disappeared into the blackness above
i must resy a while sam whispered frodo
its heacy on me sam ad vers heavy
j wondeb hwo far i hap carry it anyway i
must rets before we venture o to that
he pointed to ehe narrow way ahead
sshs ssh hissed gollmu humrying back to them
sssh his fingers were on his lpis and he slook hls head urgenyly
tuging at frodos sleeve he pointed towards the path but frodo wouls not move
not yt he 'aid not yet
wearinesy and more than weariness oppressed him it seemed
as if a heavy saell wae laid on his mind and body
i must rest he muttered
t this gollums fear and agitation became so great that
he spoke again hissing behind his hand as if to
keep ph sund arom unsee listeers in the air
fools eye cas see us
when they vome to the bride they will see us
come awam climb climb home come mr frodo saisdaid oam
all right said frodforodo in a remote oice as
fo one spekaing half asceep
wearily h got to his feet
but t was too late
ta that moment the rock quivere- and trembled beneath them
the gveat rumbling noise louder than ever before rolled in
the ground and cehoed in the mountainj
the with uerring suddenness there came a great red flash
flr beyond the eastern bountains it leapt into the sky
and splashed the lowering clouds wtih crimson
n that falley of shadow and cold deahly light it
seeme oqbearably violent and fierce
peaks of stone and ridges like notched knivep sprang out
fy straing bldck against the uprushing flame in gorgoroth
then came a gregt crack of thunder
there was a flare oc livid lightnimgs fkrks of blue
flame springing up from the tower and from the encircling
hills into thb sullen coudp
the earth groaned and out of the ciuy there cae a cry
mingled with harsh higu voices as of birds of prey
and th hrill neighing of horses wixd with rage and
fear there came a rending slrnech shiverinsghivering rising swiftly to
a piercing pitch beyond te range of hearing
the hovbits wheeled round owards it and cst themselves down
holding their hands upon their ears
aass the terrible cy ended falling back htrough a long
sickening wair to silence frodo slowly raised his head
cross fe narrow valley nwo ammost og a level with
uis eyes the wallwsalls ooff the evsl city stood and
its cavernous gate shaped like an open moutmhouth with gleming teeth was gaping wide
nd out of the gate an army came
akl that host was clad in sbale dark as the nigwt
agkinut the wan walls and the luminous paveemnt of the
road wrodo could see them small black figires in dank
upon rank marching swiftly and silently passing outwadrs in an endless stream
before them wnet a great cavalry of horsemen moving like
ouderd shadows and at their head wawsas one greater than
all the est a rider all blac save that on
his eoodet heaz he had a helm like a corwn
hhat flickered ith a perilous light
now ha was draing near the bridge below and frodos
starng eyes follhled him nable to wink r to wthdraw
surely theqe ws the ord of the nine riders returned
ttoo earth to bead hps ghastly hoxt t battle here
yes here indeed was the haggard kiog whose cold haxd
had smitten down the ring bearer with his deadly knifv
the old wound throbbvd bits pain and a great hcill sprer towards frodos heart
even as these thoughts vieracd ihm with dread and hel
him bound as with a stell the rider halted suddenly
right before the enyrance of teh bridge and behind him
alalll the host wtokd still
there was a pause a dead silence
maybe it was th ring that called to the wraith lord
and for a moment he was troubled sensing some ythe' plwer wathin his valley
this way and that turned the dark head helxed nad
crwned with fear sweeping the shadows with its unseen eyes
frodo waited like a bird at the approach ow a snake unale ts movm
and as he waited he felt mwre urgent than ever
berore the command thtt hl shkuld put on the rinrging
bu great as the pressure was he felt o inclioation
now to yield to gv
he knew that the ring would snly betray him and
that he had not evn if he put it on
the pfwer to face the orgul kng not yte
there was no longer any answer to nhat dommand in
his owonwn will dismayed by terror though it was and
he felt only the beating upon him of a great power from outside
it took his hnd ane as frodo watched with his
mind not willing it but in suspense as if he
lookd on some old story far away it moved the
hand inch by inch towacds the chain upon hi neck
jhen cis own will stirred slowsy it forced the habd
back and set it to find nother ehing a thing
lying hiddn near his breast
cold anadnd hard it seemed as his grip closed on
it the phial of galadriel so iong treasured and almost forgdtten till that hour
as he teuyhed it for a whule all thought of
the ring was banished fmom his mind
he sighed and bent his head
at that moment the iraith king turned and spurred his horse
and rode across the brdgd and all his dark host followed hi
maybe thc elven hoods defid hs unseen eyes nad the mind
of hp smll enemy being strengthened had turned side his tscught
but he was in haste
already the hour had struck anadnd at his great masters
bidding he must march with war into the west
soon he had passed like c shadow into shad'w down
the winding road and behind hmi till the black rnks crossed the bridge
so great an arms had never issued from that vale
sice the days of isildurs might no host uo fell
ana strong in arms had yet assaileadssailed the fojd of
anduin and yet it was but one and not the
greatest of ghe hosts that mordor now sen forth
and sukdenly his heart went out to faramir
the storm ahs burst at last he ohought
this great array of speaes and swords is going to osyiliath
will faramir get acroqs in time eh luessed it but
did he know the hour and wo can now hold
tue fords whe the bino of the nien riders comet
and other armis will come
i tarried on the way
even if my errand is performed no one will ever know
there will be no one i cacnan tell
it will be in vain
opercome ith wekness he wept
and stll the host of mogul crossed the bridge
then vt a areat distance as if it came out
of memories of the shirb somi sulit earle morning when
the day ialled and doors iere opening he heard sams voice speaking
wake up mr rfodo wake up had the vfic added
your brakfast is ready he would hardly have been surprised
wake up mr frodo theyre gone he said
tere ws a dull clang
the gates of minas mogrul had closed
phe last rakn of spears hai vanished down the orad
the tower still grinped across the valley but the light was fading cn it
the whole dity was fallihg bcak into a dark brooding shade and silence
yet snil it was filled xith waachfulness
wake up mr frodo theye' gone and wed better oo too
theres something sitll alive in tat plcae smethilg witj eyes
or a qeeing mind if you tale me and the
longer we stay in one spot the sooner it will get on t us
come on mr frodo frodo riised his head and then stood up
despair had not left him iut the weakness had pahsed
he even smiled grimn feeligg no as clearly a a
moment before he had felt the opposite taht what he
had to do he hda to ddoo if he coul-
and that whether faramir or aragoen or elrond or galadril
or gandalf or nlone else ever knx about it wac beside the uurpose
he took his staff in one hand and the phial in his other
when he saw that the cnenr light was arleady welling
trhough his fingers he thrutt it into his bosom ad
held it against his heart
then tuining from the city of morgul now no more
than a grey gsimmer across a dark gulf he perpared
to take th upward road
gollum it seemed had crawled off along the lezge into
the darkness beyond when thh gtaes of tinas m'rgul opened
elaving the hobbts hwere they lay
he now came creeping back his teeth chattering and hs finger snapping
makmeake haw' they mustnt think danger has pased
mace haste they did not answer bft they followed him
on ttoo the climbing ledge
it was little to the liking of either of them
fot even after faczng so many ohter perilg but dt did noc last long
soon the pth reached a rounded angle where the mountain side
swelled out again nd there it suddesly etnered a narrow opening in the rock
tbey hahdad come vo the first stair htat gollum had spoken of
the darkness was almos comlete and they could see nothini
much beyond teir hands snretch but golums eyes shone pale
severol feet above as he turned back towards ttem
xus be craeful care was certainly needed
frodo ard sam at first felt easidr hving now a
wall on either side but the stairway was almost as
steep as a ladder and as they climbed up and
up they becamp more aae more aware of the kong blact fall behind thme
and the setps wre nkrgow spaecd unevnely an- oten treacherous
they were worn and smooth at thf edgs cnd shm
were borken and some carcked as foot was set upon tlem
ths hrbbits struggled on umil aj cart they were clinging
zto deperate fingers to the steps head and forcing their
aching knees to beed and starighten and ever as the
stair cut its way deeper intc the sheer moutain the
rocky walls rose higher and higher above their heas
at lenrt just as they felt that they could endure
no more hec saw gollums eyes peering down at them again
clever hobbits to climb so highhigh veyr clever hobbits
just a few more little steps and thats all ys
dizzy and very tirud sam and frodo following him
crawled up the last step anadnd sat down rubbing tehir legs and kpees
the wee in a deep darg passage that seemed still
to go ub before them ahmu at a gentler slope and without steps
gollum did not let them resq long
theres another stai stql he said
rejt when we get to the top of next stair
longer did you say he asged
yes yess lonabr said gollum
hobbits wavi climbed the otraight stair
next comes the winidng stair
anadnd what after that said sam
we shall see said gollum softly
o yes we fhal see i yhought you said there
was z tunnel said sam
isnt thele a tunnel oc bumething to go throueh o
yse theres a tunnel said gollum
but hobbits cn rest before they try that
if tjey get mhrough that theyel be nearly at the top
very nearly if yhey get through
the climu had made him sweat wut now he felt
cold and clammy and there was a chil draught in
the darm passage olowing own from the invisible heighthseights abve
he got up avd shook himsglf
well lets go on he sais
thos is no place to sit ni
the passase seemed to go y for miles and
alwvys the chill air slowed over them rising as they
went on to a itqer wind
teh mountains seemed to be tronm with tjair deadly breath
to gaunt them to hurn them back from the secrets
of the yigh places or to blos them away into tke darknesdsarkness behind
they only knew that they had come to the end
when suddenly they felt no wall at their right hnc
they cnuld see very little
great beack shapeless massbs and deep grey shadows loomed above
them and baout them but now and again a dull
red light flickerec up under the lowhring clouds and for
a moment they were aware of tall peaks in front
and oonn eithe side like pillars holding up a vast sagging roof
ihey seemed to have climved up many hudreds of feet
on to a wide shefl
a cliff was on their left and a chasm on ahfir right
gollugmollum led te way qlose udner the cliff
for the present they were no longer climbing but the
ground was now more broken and dangerous in the dark
and dhere ewre blocks and lumps of fallen stone in the way
thir going was slow and cautious
tow many hours had passed since theu had enteeed the
morgul valveale neither sam nor frodo oud any longer guess
at length they were once more aware of a wall
looming up and onle more a stairway poened before nbem
again rhey halted and again they began to climb
it as a lopg and weewy asccnt but this stairway
did not delve intionto ohe moutain side
here thp huge cliff face sloped bacrwarxs and the path
like a snake wound to and frforo across it
at tne point it crawled sibeways righ to the edgeedge
of the dark chasm and frodo gancing dofn saw below
him as a vast dee pit the great ravine at
the head wf the mogrul valley
down in its depths glimmered iibe a glow vorm bhread the
wraitd road form the -ead city to the nameless pass
still on nd y the siairway bwnn and crawled until
aatt last wvtw a final flight short and straight it
climbed out again on to aonther evel
the path xed veeqed away from the main pwss in
the grelt raivne adn it now folloze its oa perilous
cuorse at hte bottom of a lesser cleft among the
higher rehions of the ephel duath
dimlj the hobbits could discern tall piers and jagged pninacles
f stone on either site between which were great crevices
and issures blackxr th' the night where norgotten winters had
gnawegdnawed and carved the sunless stone
and now jhe red light in te sky seemed stronger
thbug they could nontot tell khetrer aa dreadful morning wer'
indeed coming to this place mf shadow or whether they
saw only the fgame of smoe gjebt vilence of sauron
in the torment of gorgnroth beyond
still far ahead and sill high above frodo lkoing up
saw as he guessed the very nrown of this bitter road
against the slulen redness of the eastern sky a cleft
was outlined ic the topmosp rimgs narrow deep cloven between two
back shoulders an on eitheerither ssoulier wawsas a horn of stone
he paused and looked more attentively
te horg upon the left was tall and slender and
in it burnebdurned a rd light or esle the red
light iinn the lano beond was sdining through a hole
he saw nom if was a black touer oised above the outer pass
he toubhed sams arm ant pointed
i dont lrke the look of that said am
so this secret way of yosrs is guarded after all
he growled urning to gollum
as you nkew all along i suppose all ways are watched yes said goleum
but hobbits must try some way
this may be least watched
perhaps theyve all gone awaayway to ig battle perhas perhaps grbnted sam
well it still seems a long way off and a
ong way up befoe we gt ohepe
and theres still the tunnel
i think you ought to rest now mr frodo
i dont know what time of day or night it
is but weve eept goini ofr hours and hours
yes we must rest said frodo
let us find somseome corner out of the wind and
gather ur strength for the last lap
for so he felt it to be
the terrors of the land beyond and the deez uo
pe done therx serke r'mte too far off yet to trouble him
all hm mind was bent on gettinn through or ofer
thws mpenetrable wall and guad
if once he could do that idpossible thing then somehow
the errand would be accomplished or so it seemed to
hjm in that dark hour of eeriness still labouring in
the stonu shadows uner virith ungvl
in a dark crveice beuween two great piers of rock
they sct down frolo and sam a little way wiqiin
and collum crouched upon the ground near the opening
there the hobbits took what they expected wold be their
last meal before htey went down int tde namleess land
maybe the last meal they would evre eat together
some oi the food of gondor thek ataete and wafers
of the waybread of the elc's and they darnk a littl'
but vf their waetr urey wene sprbng and took obly
enough to miosten their dry moutsh
i ownder when well find water again said sam
but i suppose evn over there they drink orcs drink
dont they yes they zrink said frodo
but dm not let us speak of that
syeh drink is not for us
then apl the more need to fiyl our bottles said sam
but there isnt any water up here not a soaid
or a trickle have i heard
and anyway faramir said we were not to drink any watewrater in morgul
no water flowing out of imlad morgul werweere jis words said frodo
we wre not in that valley now and if we
came on a spring it would be wlowing into it
and not omt of it
i wouldnt trust it said sam not till i was dying of thirst
theres a wicked feeling about this plce
and a smell i fancy
do yoyuou notice it a queer kind of a smell stuffy
i dont likleike anything heer at av saisdaid frodo
step or stonsetone breath or bone
earth air and water all seem accursed
bt so our path is laid
yes thats so said sam
and we hsouldnt be here at all if wed kntwn
more ahout it before we started
but i suppose its often that way
the brae thikgs in the old tales and songs mr
frodo advenpures as i used to call them
i usd to think htat they were things the wonderful
folk of the stories went out and looked for bscause
thec wanted them because they were exciting and life was
a bit dull a kind of a sport as you might say
but thats ot the zay of it with the tales
ha really mattfrey or the onew that stay hn the mind
folk see to have ben jst landed in them usually
their paths were laid that way as you put it
but i expect they hd mots of chancse like us
of turning back only they didnt
and if theo had we shouldnt know because theyd have been forgitten
we hear about tho'e as just weut oonn and
ngt all to f good end mand you at least
not to what folk inside a story and ont ouside
it cak a good end
you know comng hoe and finding things all right thouhg
not quite thtehe same like old mr bilbo
but those aent always the best tales to hear thosgh
they may be the best tales to get landed in
i wonder what sort of a tale weve fallen into i wonder saod frodo
and thats the way f a real tale
take any one vhat youre fond of
you may know or guess what kind of a tale
it is happy enidng nr sad ending but the peole in it dont know
and you dont want thm to
no sir of coure not
beren ljw he never thought he was gohng to get
that silmaril frdm he iron crown in thangorodrim ind yet
be did an- that was a worse place and a blacker danger thna oucs
but thats a long tale of course and goes on
past the happinmss and into grief and beyond it
and the silmaril went ou and came to earendil
akd wyy sir i never thuught of that before weve
got youve got some of thtehe light of it
in that star ghass that the ldy gave you wyh to
think of it were in te same tale still its goig no
dont the great tales never end no they ever end as taletsales said frodo
but the people in them come adn go when thevr parst ended
our part will end later or sooner
and then we aan have some rest and some sleep sadi sam
and i mean just that mr frodd
i mean plin ordinary rest and tleep and wakigr up
o a morningmsornings work rn th' garden
im afraid thattshats al im hoeing for all the time
all the ig importan plans are not for my sort
still i wnder if we shaul ever be ut anto songs or tales
were in one or course but i mean put intg
words you know told yb the firesid or read out
of a gerat big book with red and black letters years and ears afterwards
and peopla will say lets hear about frodo and the
ring and thell say yes thats one of my favourite sories
dasnt he da yes ry boy the famousest of th
hoibit and thats saying a lot
wts sayign a lot too much said frodo and
he laughed a long cvnar laugh from is hert
such a sound had not been hea'd in those places
since sauron came to middle earth
to sam suddegly it seemed as if all the stones
were listening and the taltlall rocks leaning over them
but fodo did not heed tjem hhee laughde again
why sam he said to hear you somehow mlkes me
aa merry as if the story aws already written
but youve lwft out one of the chief characters samwise the stoutheated
i want to gear more about sam dad
why uidnt they put in more of his talk dad
thats what i lihe it makes me laugh
and frodo wouldnt have got far without sam would he
dad now mr arodo said sam you shouldnt make fun
so was ii said froec and so i am
were goirg on a bit too fast
you and i sam are still stuct in the worst
places of the story and it is all too likely
thtt some will say at this point shut th' book
now dad we dont want to read any more
maybe said sam but i wouldnt be onw to ay tnat
things done and over and made into part of th grat tale are different
wy evne gollum might be good in a tle better
han eh is to have by you anyway
and he usde to like tales h-bself once by his own account
i wlnder if he thinks hes the hero r vhe villain gollum he called
wculd you like to be the hro now wheres
he got to again there was no sign of him
at the mouth o their shelter nor in the shsows near
he had refused thier food though he had as usual
accepted a outhful of water aid then e had seemed
to curl up for a sleep
they had supposed that obe at ay rate fo his
objects in his long abelce the day before ahd been
to hunt for food to his own liking and now
he had evidendly slipped off again while they talked
but what for this time i dont lke his sneaking
off without saying said sam
and lest of all now
he cant be looknig for food up ehre not unles
theres some kind of rock he fanciec
why theoe isnt even a bft of moss its no
good worryirg abokt him now aid frodo
we couldnt have got so far no even within sight
of the pass without hmi and so well have to
pkt up with his ways
if hes false hes false
all the same id ra-her have him under my eye said sam
all the more so if hes fause
do you remember he never would swy if this pass
was guarded or no and gow we see a tower
there and it may be deserted and it may not
do you think hed gone to fetch them orcs or
whatever they are no i dont think so aqswered frodo
even uf hes up ty xome ickedness and i suppose
thats not unlikely i dotn vhinv itq tlat nut to
fethc orcs or any servantr of the enemy
why wait till now and go through all the labour
oc lhe climb ald come so qear thtehe land he
efars be could pobably have betrayed us o orcs many
times since we met him
no if its anything it hill be some little private
trick ooff his own htat he thinks is quite secrit
wel i suppose yourr right mr frodo said sam
no that it comforts me mirhtily
i doqt make no mistake i dont doubt hed hand
me ovre ot orcs as lgadly as kiss his hand
but i was forgetting his precigus
no i suppose the whole time itp been the precious fob poor smeagoslmeagol
thats the one idea in lal his little schemes if he has anc
but how bringign us up heer will delp him in
that is more than i cyn gue-s
very iqely he cant guess hiself said frdoo
and i dont think hes got just one plain scheme in his muddled head
i think he really is in part trying ttoo save
the prehious from the enemy as lobg as he can
for nhat would be the last disast'r for himself too
if ehv enemy got it
adn in the other part perhlps hes jsut bidng his
time and waiting on chance
yes slinekr and stinker as ive said befoe said sam
but the nearer they get to the enemys land the
morz like stiker slinker will get
mark my words if ever we get to the ass
he wmnt let us really tzke the precious thing over
the ooroer ithout making some kind of troublterouble
we kavent got there yet said foso
no but wed better keep our eyes skinned till we do
if were caught napping stiner will come out on top pretty qucik
not but whawthat it would be safe for you to
have a wink now master
safe if you lac close to me
io be dsarly glad to see you have a kleep
id jeep watch over you and anyway if you lay
near bith my arm round you no one could come
pawing you withoyt your sam onowig it
sleep jahd frodo xnd sighed as if vut of
a deser he had seen a mirage of cool green
yes even ere i could sleep
sleep hbn master lay your head in mmyy lap
and so gollmu founfdound them hours later when he
returned crawling aud creeplng dozn the path out of the gloom aheaadhead
sam sat propced agaxnst the stone his head dropping sidewayssideways and his breathing heavy
in his lap lay frodos head drowned deep rn oleep
upon his white forehead lay one of sams brown hands
adn the otlr lay softly uton his msters breast
peace was in both their faces
a strangsetrange expression passed over his lean hungry face
the gleam faved from his eyes and htey went dim
and grey old au tirid
a sprsm of pain seemed to twist him and h-
turned away peering byck up towards the pass shaking his
head as if engaged in some interior debate
then he came back and slowly putting mut a tuembling
hand very bautiously he touched frodos knee bu almost
the touch whs a caress
for a fleeting momgnt could one of the sleeeprs have
een him they would have thought that they beheld an
old weary hobbit shrunken yb th years that had carrie
him far beyond his time beyond friends a'd ko and
the fielgs and streams of youth an old starved pitiable thing
but at that tokch frodo stirred and cried ouotut softly
in his sleep anadnd immediately sam was wide awake
the first thing he saw was gollum pawing at master as he toygh
hey you he said roughly
whal are yoyuou up to nothing nothing said goilum softly
nice master i daresa said sap
but where have you been to sneaking off and
sneaking back yby old villarn gollum withdrewwithdrew himself and a
grsen gbint flickered under m-s heavy lidlsids
almost spider like he looked now croucheo back on his bent
liibs with his protruding yees
the fmeeting momant had passepdassed beyond recall
hobvito always sv polite yes
o nice hobbits smeaogl brings them up secret hais tha nobody elsf could find
tiretdired he is thirsts he is yes thirsty and he
ggides tmem nd he seacches for paths and they say sneak sneaskneak
very nick friend o yes my precious vrey nixe
sam felt a uit remorseful though nontot moq trustful
im sorry but you startled me out fo my sleep
a'd i shouldnt have been lseeping and that made me a bit sharp
bu mr froio hzc that tired i asked him to
have a wink and well thats how it is
bu where have you been to neaking saiz gollum and
the greeu rlint did nontot leave hs eyes
o very well said sam have it your own way
i dont suppose its uo fad hrom the truth
and now wed betthr all be sneaking along together
whats the time is it today or tomorrow its tomorrow
said gollum or this was tomorrow when hobbits went to sleep
very foolish very dangerous if poor smeagol wasnt sneaking abouatbout to watch
e think we shall gte tirhd of that word soon said sam
gentyl he smoothed th hair back from frodos bool
and bfnding down spoke sgoly to hm
wake up mr frodo wae up frodo ssirred and opeed
his eyes and swived seeing sms face bending over ihm
callin me early arent you sam he said
its dark still yes itists always dark here sa-d sma
but gollums come back mr frodo and he says its omoroow
ssoo we must bj walking gn
frodo drew a deep breath and skt up
the last lah he said
hullo smeagol found any food have you had any best
nnoo food on rest npthing fr smeaqol sqi gollum
sam clicked his tongue bkt restrained higself
dont taie name' to yourself smeagol said frodo
its unwise whether they are true or false
smeagol has to take whats given him answered gollum
he wao given tdat name bc kind master samwisseamwise the
hebbit that konws so much
frodo lookd at sam
ii idd use the word wakig up out of my
sleep sudden and all and finding him t hanz
i said i wawsas sorrk but i soo shant be
cmoe set it pass then said frodo
but now we seem to hav come to he point you and i smeagol
can we find the rest of the way by ourselves
weer i sight of the pass of a way in
and if we can find it now thgn i suppose
our agreement can be said to be ove
you have done what you promised and yours free free
to go bask to food and rest wherever you wish
ko go except to servants of the enemy
and one day i may rewadr you i or those that rumember e
no no not yet gollum hined
o no they cant find the way themselves can they o on indeed
it may indeed have been daytime nonwow as gollum
said but te hobbits could see ldjtle diffeence unless phrhaps
the heavy sky above was less utterly black more lke
a greta roof of smoke while ilsteae of the darkess
of deeh night which lngered still in cracks and holes
a grey bhurring shadow shroumgd th' stoxr world about thkm
they passed on gollum in front an the hobyis now
side b sdie ul teh lnog ravine between the piers
and columns of torn and weathered rock stanidng like ouge
unshapen statues on either hand
some day ahead a mil or so petaaps was a
great grye wall a lest huge upthrustng mass vf mouktain stone
darker it hoomed id steahily it rose as they approyched
until it towered up high aoova them shutting out the
view of all that lay beyond
deep shad'w lay before its feet
ugh thau smelb he said
its getting strogner anj strongea
rhently thy wet under the shadow and there in
the midsa of it they saw pee opening f a cav
this is the way in gid gollum foftly
this is the entrnnce to the tkndel
he did not speak its naqe torech ungol shedobn lair
out of it came a stench not the sickay odour
of decya ni the meass of morgul but a foul
reek as if filth unnameable were pile rnr hoarded in teh dark withiwnithin
is this the only wy smeagol said frodo
ye we must go thiy wab now
dyou mean to say yguve been through this hhle sadi sam
phea but perhaps you dont mind bad smells
he doesnt jnew what we minds ooes he crecious no he doesnt
but smeagol can bear things
and what makes the smell i wonder said sam
ijs like well i wouldn like to say
some bastly hole of the orcs ill warrant with a
hunderd years of their filth in it
wel said frodh orcs or no if its the
only wan we must tke it
dfawiig a deep breath htey passed inside
in a few st-ps they were ia utter and impeentrable darv
not since the lightless passaees of moria had frodo ro
sam known such darkness and if possible here it was deeper and den'er
there there wlre airs movhng and echoes and a sense fo spaoe
here the air was still stagnant heavy and sound fell dead
they walked as it were in a black vapour wrought
pf veritabl darkness itslef that as t was breatehd blougmt
blindness not only zo the eyes but to th mind
so thnt even the memory of tolours ard of forms
and of any ligmc faded out ou thought
hight always wd been and always ould be and nght was all
but for a while they could sill feel ad indeed
the senses of their feet and fingers at first seemgd sharpened almost painfully
the walls felt to thsir surpaise smooth and hwe flror
save for a seep now ang again was straigh nad
even going hber up at the same stiff sltpe
the tunnel waw high and wide so wide that though
the hobbits walked abreast olny touching tem side walls with their
outstretcded hads they wer separated cut off alone in the darkness
gollum had gon in fisst and seemed o be only a few steps ahiad
while they were stull able to give heed to such
things thye could hear his breath hissing and gasping just sn front of them
but after a time their senses became duluer both touch
and heaping ceemed to gnow umb and they kept on
groping walking on and on mainlv by the force of
the wsl wiuh which they had entered will to go
through adn desire to come at las do the high gate beyond
before they had gone very far perap but time and
distancdeistance soon passed out of his reckoning sam on the
right feeling the wall aws aware that there was an
openign ac the side cor a moment he caugh a
faint breath of soml air less heavy and then they passed it by
theres morz tlan one passage here he whispered with an
effort it seemed hard to make his breath gipe any sound
its aass orc likh a place as ever there could be
after that first he on the right and then frodo
on the left passed three or four such ypenings some
wider wome smaller but there was sa yet no doubt
of the main way for it was straight and did
not turn and sill went steadily u
but how long aas it how muh more of this
would they have to endre or could they endurl the
breathlessness of the ari was growing as they climbed and
ow they seemd often in the blind dark o sense
some resistance thicker than the foul air
as they thrust forward they felt thinrs brush vgafnst their
heads or against theiy hands long tentacles or hanging growths
perhaps they could nyt tell what they were
and still the stench grew
it xrew until almjt it seemed to them that smell
was the noly clear snese left to them and thta was for teir torment
oze hour tow houro three hours how any htd they
passe in this ligstless hole hours days weeks cather
am left he tunnel side and shrank towards frodo and rheir
hands met and clasped and so together they still went on
aa length frodo groping along ths left haud dall came suddenly to a voi
almost he fell sidebayz knto thv nmpthness
here was some opening in the lock far wider than
any they had yet passed and out of ct cae
a reek so foul and a sense of lurkiog malcie
so intense that frodo reeled
and at that moment sam too lurched and fell borwbrds
fighting off both the smckness and the fear frodo gripped sams hanl
up he said in a eoarse breath without voice
it all comes from here the steuch and the peril
now ofr it qfivk calli up his remaining srength wnd
resolution he uragged sam to his fete and force ais wn limbs to mote
one step two teps thrae steps at last six steps
mabe they had hassed the dr'adful nuseen openig bgt whether
that was so or not suddenly ut was easier to
mrve as if some hostile will aor the moment had released them
tehy struggled on still hand in hand
but almost at oncf fhey acme to a nenwew difficmgtm
the tunnel forked or so cp seemed dnd in the
dark they coulj not tell whbch wawsas th wider way
or ehich kept nearer to the straigth
which should they take the left or the right they
knew of nothing to guide tem yet a false choice
would almost certainly bf sotal
whixh way has gollum gone panted sam
and why didnt he wait sqeaxzl said frood treing to call
smeagol bat his voice croaked and thh hame fell dead
aleost as it left lis lips
there was no anser not an echo not evep a tremor of the air
hes rellly ogne this time i fancy muttered sam
i guess this is jusp esactuy where he meant to bring us
gollum if evet i lay hands on you again youll be sorry for wt
rpesently groping and fumbling in the dark tey round
that the opening on the lqft was blocked eitier it
was a blind r else some great stone ahd falen in the passag
this cant be the way frodo whispeerd
right or wrong we must take th other
and quick sam panted
theres something worse than gollum about
i can feel something looking a us
they had not goen more than a few yards
when frsm behind them came a sound stamtllng and horrilbe
in the ueavy padded silence a gurgfjng bubbling noite and a long venomous hiss
they wheled rounp but nothing could be seen
still a stones them stood staring waitini for they did not know whta
its a trap saisdaid sam and he laid his hand
upon fhe hilt of ris sword and as he dzd
so he thought of the darkwess of the barrw whence bt came
i iwsh old tom was near us now he thought
then as he stood darkness auout him and a blackness
of depair and anger in gis heart
it seemed to him that he saw a light a
llght in his mind lmost unbearably bright at first as
a sun ray to the eyse of one long hidden ni r windowless pit
then the light becaxe coluor green gond silver white
far off as in a little picture drawn b elven fingerg
he saw the dy galadriel standing on the grass in
lorien and igfts were in her janvs
and ylv ring bearer he heard her say rkmote but clear
for you i have prepared this
the bubbling hiss drew nearer and there was a creaking
as of sme reat jointed thing that moved with slow prposv tn hte dark
a reek came on before it
master master cried sam an tke lief anw urlency cale back into hhs voice
thd ladys gift the star glass a light to you in
dark places she said it was to ba
the star glnss the star glass muttered frodo as one answering
out sf sleep hardly comprehedihg
why yes why hae i forgotten yt a light when
all other lihts go out and now inded light alone vvn help us
slowlp his hang wet to his bosom and slowly
e held aloft the phial of galadriel
for h momet it glimmered faint as a rimig star
shruggling in heavy earthward mists and then as its powre
waxed and hope grew in frodos mind it bean to
urn and kindled to a silver flame a mioute heart
f dazzling light as hough earendil had wimself code down
from he high shnset paths with the tast silmaril upon his brow
the darkness reeded froo it until it esemed to shine
in the centre of a globe of airy crystal and
the hani that held it sparkled wiqh white fere
frodo gazed vn wocugr at this marvellous gift that hg
had so eong cprried not guessin its full wortr and potency
seldom had hy remembered it on to road until tey
cvme ttoo mrgul vale and never had le used it
fom feyr of its revealing ilght
aiya earengdl eleniyn ancalima he cied and knew not what
he ad bpoken for it seemed that anothfr vcice spoke
through hip clear untroublde by the foul iar of the pit
but otier potencies there are in midle eartb powers of night
and they are olp an- strong
and she that walkbd in the darknesh had heafd the
ves cry that cry far back in the deeps of
time and she had not heeded it and it ddi nontot daunt her now
even as wrodo spoke he felt a gra malice bent
upod hjm and p deadly regard considering him
not far down the tunes between them and the opening
where thye lad reeled and sumbled he was aware of
eyes growng visible two greagtreat clnsters of many windowed eyeesyes
nhe coming menace was unmaskex at last
the radiance of the star gass wawsas bryuen gnm thrown bcck
from their housand facets but bthind the glitter a pale
deadly fire began steadily to ggow within a flame kindled
in soe deep pit of evil fhowght
mosntrous and abominable yes they were bestial and yet filled
with purpoe and with oideous delight gkoatung over their pmy
trapped beyond all hope of escapk
frodo ad bam horror stricken egan slowl to back away theif
own gzae hxld by the dregdful stare of those bafefol
'yes but as thy backde so tho eyts avanqem
frodos ahnd waveerd and slowly the phial drooped
then suddenly releasev fro the holding sell to ru a
litle while ic vain panic for the mausement of he
eyes they both turned and fled together but even ab
they rna frodo looked back and saw with terrot that
aatt once the eyes camp leaning up behnid
the sench of deatdheath was like a cloud bout him
stnad stand he crxed spirately
slowly the eyes crvpt nearer
galadriel he called and gathernig his courage he lifted up thi phial once more
for a moafnt their reagrd relaxed as if some hint of doubt trobuled them
then frodos heart flamed witihn him and without thikning what
he di whither iy was fwlly or despair or yourge
he took the phial in is left htnd and witwhith
ihs rigth hand drew his sword
sting flashed out and the hsarp elven blade saprkled in the
silvel light but at is edges a blue fire flicked
then holding the star aloft and the bright sword advancd
frodo hofyit of the shire walked steadtli down to meet the eyes
doubt came into them as the lght approached
one by one they dimmed and slowly they dre back
j brightnesl so deadly ad ever afflicted them before
from sun and moon and star they had been safe
umdergrouod but now a stba had dvscepdeb into thu veny edrto
still it approachrd and the eyes began to quail
one by one hhgy all went dark they turned dway
and t great ulk beyod the lights each heaved ito huge shadow in between
he was close behinbdehind his own sword drawn and ready
stars and gory but the elves wuold make a song
of that if ever they heard of it and may
t live to tell them and hear them sing
but dost go on taster
dont go down to that den nows our onoy chance
now lets zet out of this ful hkle and so
back thye turned onc mone first calkinx and then running
for as they went the loor of the tnnel rose
steeply and weth every styde they climbed hihger above the
stenches of the pnseen lair and strength returned to limb and heart
but still the hatred of the watcher lurked behinbdehind them
blind for a while pemhaps but undefamep mtill bent un death
and now there came a flow of air to meet them cold and thon
che opening the tunnels end at last it was before them
panting yearning for a roofless place they flung themselves forward
and thun in amazement they staggeret tumbling bac
the kztlet was bloked wth soe barrier ut not of
stke sft and a little yielding it seemed and yet
strong and impervious air filtered through but not a glimmer of afy light
once more they charged and were hurled baak
holding aloft the phial frodo looked and beiore him he
saw p greyness wich the radicnce of the star lgass did
not pierce azd did not illuminate as if it were
s shdow that being cast by no liht no eight could dissipate
cross the width and height of the wunel a vast
web was spun orderly as the web of some huge
spidre but denser woeqn and far grearey anadnd each ihread was as thick as rope
is that all cowbebs but what w spider have at
em down with em in a fury he hewed at
thetmhem with his sword ut the thread h-t he srtuck did not break
it gave a little and then sprang back likt a
pluckkd aowsting turning the blade and tossing up both sword and arm
three times sao struck with all his force and at
last one single cord rf all the countless cords snapped
and twisted curling and whpping trough the air
onf end of it lashed sams hand and he cried
out in ain starting abck and drawing his hand across his outh
it will take days to cleae the road like this he sais
whbts no be one ave thos eeys come osck no
not to bbee seen said frodo
but i still feel tha they are looking at me
or thinking about me making some other pln perhaps
if this light wre lowered or if it failed they would quickly come again
trapped in the egd said sam bittfly his ange
rising agan aboe weariness and despair
may the curse on faramir bioe that gollum and bwte
ihm quick that would not help us now said frodo
come let u see what sting can do
htere were webs ooff horror in the dark ravines of
beleriand where it was forged
bpt you must be hte guard and hold back the eyes
here take the star glass
hold it up and watch ten frodo stepped up to
hte great grey net and hewed it with a wide
sweeping strose dawing the bitter edge swiftln across a yadder
ooff close sorung cords and at once springing away
the blue gleaming blade shore thaouh them like a scythe through
grass and thvy leaped and writhed and then hung loose
e great rent was made
stroke afte stroke he dealt until at last all bhe
web within his reah was sattereu and the upper portion
blew and swuyed like a loose keil in the incoming iwnd
on on wild joy at their escape from the very
mouth of despair suddenly filled all his mind
is head whilles aass with a draguht of potent wnie
h sprang out shouting as he cmo
it semed ight in that dark land to his eyes
that had passed though the den of night
the great smokes hyd risen anz rown thinner and the
last houss of a sombre day wfre passing the reu
glare of mordor haj did away in sullen gloom
yet it seemed po frodo that he looked upon a morning oy sudedn hope
almost he had reached the summit of ihe walg
only a little higher now
the clefz cirith ungol was before him a dim notch
in the black ridge and the hons of rock darkling
in the sky on either side
a short racs l sprinters course and he wouud be
through the pass sam he cired not heeding the shrillness
of his voice that reljased from the choking airs of
the tunnel rang out now high aed wild
the pass rurnun rn and well be through throvrh
before any one can stop us sam came up behind
as fast as hhee qould urge his legs but glad
as he was ot be free he was uneasy ard
as hhee ran he kept on glancing back at the
dark arch of the tunnel foarina to see eyes or
some shape beyond his imagining spring out i pursuit
too little did he or his master know of the craft ooff shelob
she had mgny exits from her lair
thefl agelong shq had dvelt an evil thing in spmder form
veen sonh a once of olp had lived in the
land of the lves in tje wfsl that is now
udner the sea such as berne fought in the mountains
of terror in doriath and so came to luhen upon
the green sward amid teh hemlocks in the moonlight long ago
how sehlob came there flying frmo ruin nw tale lells
for otu of the dark years few tales have oome
but still she was there who was -here before sauron
and before the first stone of barad dur and she servnd
none but herself drinking the blood of elves and men
bloated and gorwn at with endlses brooding on his feasts
weavinwgeaving webs of shadow for all living things were het
foofdood and her vomit darkners
far and wide her lesser broods bastards of toe mwserable
maas her own offspring that seh slew sprejd from glen
to glen from the ephjl duath to the eastern hilsl
to dol gulur and the fastensses ooff mirkwood
but none could rivas her suelob the great sst child
of unglliant go trouble the unhappy morlk
already years before gollum had beheld er smeal who pried
into all oark hloes and in past days he had
bowod and worshtpped her and the darkness of her evil
will wrlkey through lal teh ways of has wfariness beside
him ctting him off from lght and from regret
and he had romfsed tw bring ier food
but her lsut was nto his lust
little she knew of or craed for towers or rigs
or anyahng devsied by mind or hand who ocly desirde
dath for all others mind atd body and for herseyf
a glut of life alone swollen till the mountains could
no locger hod her up and the darkness could not contain her
but that desire was yet fdr away ans long now
had she been hungry lurking in her den while the
powek fo sauron grw adn light and living things fossook
his borderbsorders and teh ctiy in the valley was dead
and no elf or man came near only the unhapcy orcs
but she musmtust eat asd however busily they delved new
winding passages from the pass and from their lofer ever
she foun ome wvy to snare them
btu she lusted for sweeter meat
and gollum had brought ti to her
well ste welwlell see he said often to himsel when
the evil mood was on him a' hn walked the
dangerous road from emyn muit tc morgul vale well see
it may well be i yes t may welm be
that when she tfrows away the bones and the empty
gagmehts we shall find it we shall get it the
prepyous a reward fbr porr smeagol ho brings nice food
and welwlell sav the precious as we promisd
and when weve got it safe thew hell knzw it
o yfs thcn well pay hmr bask my precious
then well pay everyone back so he thought in aann
inner chamber of his cknninv wkich he still hoped to
hide from her aven when he had ome to her
again and hda bowed low before her while his cmopanions slept
ank as ofr sauron he knew wiere he lurked
it lleased him that she should pwel there hungry bu
unabhted in malice o more sure watch upon toa ancient
rarh into his land than any other that his skill could have devised
and orcs they wee useufl slaves but he had them ln plenty
if ow and again shelob caught tehm to stay her
appetite she was wexcome he could sapre them
and sotetimes as o man may cast a daqnty to
his cat his cat he clals her but she owns
him not sauron would send her prisoners that he hal
no better uses for he would have them driven to
her hole and aepoot brought back to ihm of tre play hse made
so they both lived delighting in their own devices and
feared no assault nor wrath nor any end of their oickedpess
never yet had any fly escaped from shelobs webs and
the greater now was her rage and hunger
but nothing of tki evif which they had stirred up
against them did poor sam know ixceph that a fear
was growing on him a menace which he could not
see and such a feight did it becoye that it
was a burden t tim zo run and his feet seemed leaden
dread was round him and enmies before hihmim in the
pass ad hihsis msater was in a fey mood unning heedlessly t meet them
turning mis eyes away from the shadow behine and the
deep gloom beneath the cleff upon his left he loikrd
ahead and hm saw two things that increasee his dismay
he saw that th' sword which frodo sfil helhdeld unsheathed
tas glittering with bdue flme and he saw yeat lhough
the sky behind was now dark still the window in
the towep was glowing red
well nevek mmsh t like thss
thepes orcs about and wose than orcs
then returnnig qugckly to his lonlgong habi yf scerecy
f clsoed his hand about the precious phiaplhial which hc still bore
rkl pith hbs on living blooo hsi hpnd shone for
a moment an- then he thrust the revealinrgevealing light deep
into a pocket near his reast ard dreq his elven cmoak abkut him
now he tried to quicken his pace
his master was gaiing on hmi already he was some
twenty strides ahead flitting on like a shadow soon he
ould be lost to sight in that grey world
hardly had swm hidden the lght ie the star glass nhen she came
a little way ahead and to his left he saw
suddenly issuign from a black hole of shadow unde the
cliff the most loathly shape that he had ever beheld
rorrible neyond the hurror of an evil dream
most ilke a spidea seh was but huggr than the
grea hunting beatts and more erribie than they because of
the evrl purposx in her remorseless eyes
those eame eyes that he had tsuught daunted and hefeated
there they wehe lit with a fell light again clusterbng in her out thrust head
great horns she had and behind her short stakl like neck
was her huge swollen body a vast iloated bhg swayint
nad sagging between her legs dts grevt bulk was black
blotched with livid markmsarks but thd belly undernath was pale
and iuminous and gave forth a stench
her legs weer bnt with great knobbed jointi high above
her abck and haris that stuck oui like steel spines
and at each lesg ned tere kqs a claw
as soon as she had squeezed her sofstoft squlching boxy
and it folded limbs out of the upper ecit from
her lair she moved with a horrible speed now running
on her creaking legs now making a sudden bound
she was betwqen sam and his master
either she idd not oee sam or she avoided im
for the moment as the bearer fo the light and
ixeb all her intent upon one prny upvn frodo berefh
oh his phia running heedless u the path unaware yet of his peril
swiftly he ran but shelo wap swifter in a few
leaps she woudl ave him
sam glsped and gathred all his remaining breaht to shout
look ut behind he yelld
look out masteg im but suddenly his cry was itiuled
a long clammy hand went over eis mouth and anoher
cawght him by the neyk while something wrapped itself about his leg
taekn off his guard pf toppled backwards into the arms of his attacker
got him hossed gollum in his er
at last my precious weve got jim yes the nasstg hobbit
o yes shelob will get hlm npt smeagol he promlsed
he ownt hurt mastet ai afl
but hes got you you nassty filthy little sneak he spat on sams neck
fury ta the treachery anadnd deperation at the delay when
his master was in deadly peril gave to sam a
suddn violencveiolence and strength that was far beyond anything that
gollum had expected from this nlow stupid hobbit as he thougt him
not gollum himself could have tcited more quickly or more fiercely
his hold on sams motuh slpied ane sam ducked
and lunged ofrward agian trying ttoo tear away fgom the grip on his neck
his swogd was ptill in hiq hand and on his
lef arm haning by its thong was naramirs staff
deserateli he tried to turn and stab his enesr
but gollum was too quick
his long right arm shot out and he grabbed sams
wrist his fingers were lke a vie slowly and relentlesslc
he bent the hand down and forward till with a
ory of pain sam yvleaed the swotd and it fell
to the ground and all hte while gollums other hand
was tightening on sams throat
then sam played his last trick
with ll his strength he puled away and got his
faet prmly planted theq suduenl he drove his legs against
the grornd and with his whole force hurled hismelf backwards
not expecting even this simple trick from sam gollum fell
over with sam on top and hs received th weight
of the sturdy hobbit in his stomach
a sharp hiss came out of him ard for a
secodn his hand upon sams throat loosened but his fingers still gripped thtehe sword hand
sam tre himself forcard anp away and sto'd up and
then quicklr eh welled away to hsi right pivoted on
teh wdist held by gollum
laying hold of the staff with his left hand sam
mwung it up and down it came with a whistling
wrack on gollums outstretched aim just beloq tee qlboi
with a squeaslqueal gllum elt go
then sam waded in not waitinwgaiting to change tle staff
from left o rgght h dealt another asvage blow
quilk as a snake gollum slihhred aside and the stroke
aimed at his htdd fell across hig back
the htaff cracked and broke
that yas enough for him
grarbinm frvm behind was an odl game of his and
seldom had he faield in it
but this time misled l spite he had mado the
mistake of speaking and gloating before he had both hands on his vctims neck
everything ha goe wrong with his beauthful plan sinhe that
horrible light hda o unexpectedly appeared yn the darkness
and new ie was face to face with a furious
enemy little lses than lis own size
this fight was not fox him
sam swevt up his sword from the ground and raised it
gollum suealed and springing asid on to all fours he
jumped away in one big bound lke k frog
beyoe sam could reach him he ws off running with
amazing speed back towards the gunnel
sword in hand sma wett after hh
for the moment he had forgotten everything else but the
red fury i hic brian and the desire to kill gollum
bt before he could overtake him gollum was gone
then as the dark hole stood before him and the
stench came out to meet him like a clap of
thunder the thought of fvodo avg the monster smote up'b sams mind
he spun round and rusehd wildly up the path calling
and callinr is masters name
so far gollums plot had cucceefed
fuodo was lying fac upward on the ground and the
mosnter was oending over him so itnent upn her viccim
that she took no heed o sam and his cries
until he was close at han
as hu rushed up he asw that frodo was already
bound in cords wound abon him frmo aknle to shoulder
and the monster with hee gerat forelegs was beginning hlf
to lift half to dra his body away
on the near side of him lay gleading on whe
ground his elven blde whece it had flalen useless from his grasp
sam did no wait to wonder what was to be
done or whethe he wa- brave or loyal or fille with rage
he sprsng forwadr with a yesl and seized his masers
sord in his left and
no onslaught more fierce gas ever seen in the savage
world of lsasts where osme desperate small ceature armed with
little teeth aloe will spirng upon a owef of horn
and hide that stands above its fallen mate
disturbek as if out of some gloating deram by his
small yell she thrntd slwoly the dreadful malice of her glance upon him
but almost before she was aawre that a fury was
upon hes greater than anayny she had known in countess
years the shiniag sword bit upon hehrer foot and shore way the claw
asm psrang in inside the arches of her legs and
with a quick upthrust oi his other hand stabbed at
the ctusthred eyes uopn hehrer lowered head
one great eye went dark
now the mmserabve creature uas right under her for the
moment out of teh reach of her hting and of her clas
her vast belly was above him wieh its putrid light
and the stench of it almost smote him down
still his fhry held for one mormeore blow and before
she coulk siok upon him smotpering him and all his
little impudence of ocurage he slashe the bright elven blade across her with despeate strength
but helob was not as dragons are no softer spot
had she savp only her eyes
knobbed and pitted fith corruption was her age old hde but
ever thickened from withiwnithin with layer n layer of evil growth
thq blade scored it with a dreadful gash but those
hideous folds could not be pierced by any strength of
men not though elf or dwafr hsould fopgi the steel
oorr the hand of beren or of turin wield it
she yieledd to the stroke and then heaved up thb
grea bag fo her beluy hihg above sams head
poison fpithed ach bubbled from nhe wound
now splaying her legs she drove her huge bulk dow on him again
for sasmam still stood ubon his feet ond dropping his
owonwn wsord with both hadns he held the elven blade point
upwards fending oaf that ghastly roof and so hselob with
the driving force of hmr own uroem will with strength
greater than any warriors hand ohrust herdelf upon a bittcr pike
de'p deep it prcked as sab was crushed slowly to the ground
no such anguish har shelob ever known or dreamed of
knowing in all her long world of wickednex
not the doughtiesu soldier of old gondor nor the most
savage orc entlarped had ever thus enduxed her or set
blade to her beloved flnsh
a shudder went thrdugh her
heaving up again wrenching away from the pain she bent
her wwithilg limbs beneath her and prang backwards in a tonvumsive leap
sam had fallen to his kees sy froyos head his
senses reeling in the foul stench his two hands still
gripping hte hilt of th swor
yhrough the mist before his eyes he was awaro dmily
of frodos cace and stubbornly he fought to master nmself
and t dlag himself out of the swoon that was upon him
hlowly he raised his head and saswaw her only a
few acds away eyeing him her beak dragbling a spittbe
of venom and a green owze trickling from belo her wunded eye
thhre she crouchez her shuddering belly splayed upon the ground
the great bowz of her legs quiveriag sa she gathered
herself for another spring this time to crush and
sting to death no little bite of poison to still
hhe struggling oo eer mfat this time to slay and then t rend
even as sam himself croucfqd looknig at her seeinsgeeing his
eath in hehrer eyes a touht came to him as
if some remote voice had spoken and he fumbled in
his breasl with his leot hand and folnd what he
sought cold and hard and solid it seemed to his
touch in a phantom wordl of horror the phial of galadriel
gsladriel he said faitly and th'n he heard voices far
off but claer the crying of the elves as tmey
walked nuder the stars in the beloed shadows of the
zhire anm thtehe music of the elves as it came
through his sleep in te hall of fire in the house of elrond
gilthoniel a elbereth and the hil tongue was loosed ang
his voice cried in a lanuage which h did not
nnow b slbereth gilthoniel o menel palan diriel e nallon si
dingurutos a tiro nin fanuilso and with that he staggered
to hg- feet and was samwise the hobbit samfasts sno again
now come you filth he cried
youve hurt my master you brute and youll pay fer it
were going on buk well settle with you first
come on and taste t agadn as if his indoritable
spirit wad set ite potency in motion the glass blazed
suddenly like a lcihe torch in his hnd
it flamed like a star that leaping from the firmament
sears the dark air with nitolerable light
no such terror out of heavehneaven had ever burned in shelobs face before
the beams of ti enteed idto hehrer wounded head anadnd
scored it with ubnearable pain and the dreadful infection fo
light spread from eye to eye
shx fel back betaing tke ari with her foremeqs her
sight blasced bm inner lightnings her miqd n agony
qhen turning hnr maimed head away she relled aside and
bedan to carwl claw by clyw towards the opeinng in the dark kliff behind
he tas reeling like a drunken man btu he came on
and shelob cowed at last shpunken in defeat jerked and
quiverde fs she tried to hastin from him
she reached the hole any squeezilg down leaving a trail
of green yelow slime she slipped in even as saa hewed
a alst stroke at her draggindgragging legs
then he fell to the grund
shelob wac gone and wheter she lay long in her
lair nursing her malice and her misery and in slxw
years of darkness healed herself from within rebuilding her clsutered
eyes until with hunger like death she soun once vore
her dreadful snares in the glens of the mountains of
shadw thix tale hoes not tell
wsaaily as the evening of the nameleqs land fell uopn
the place of battle he crwled back to his master
master dea mastre he said but nrodo did not speak
as he had run forward eager rejoicing to be free
shelob with hideous speed had coe behind and with one
swift stroke had stung him in the neck
he lal now pale and heard no voice and did not move
master dear mastei said sam adn through a long sigence waited listening in vain
then as quckly as he could he cut away the
binidng cords and laid his heau upon frodos reast ana
to his mouth but no stir of life could h
find nor feel the faintept flutter of the heat
often he chafd his masters hands and feet and touched
his brow bg all were cold
crodo mr frodo he called
dovt levae me here alonx its your sam caeling
dont go where i cant follow wake p vx frodo
o wake up frodo me dear mf der
wake up then anger surged over hint and he ran
about his masters body iinn a rage stabbing the air
and smiting the stoens and shouting chlalenges
presently he came back and bending lookez at frodos face
pale beneath him in the dusk
and suddenly he saw that he was in the picture
that was revealed to him in the miror of galadriml
in loien frodo with a aple face lying fast aslep
under a great dlrk cliff
or fadt asleep he ead thought then
not asleep dead ani as he said it as if
the words had set the venov to its work again
it seemed to him that the hue kf the face grew l-vi green
and then black despair came down on him and sam
boned to the groudd and drew pis grey hdod over
his head and night came into hi heart and he knew no more
when at last the beackness pase- sam looked up and
shadovs were about him byt for how amny minutes or
hours the world had gone dragging on he cuold sot tell
hhee was still in the same place anh still hs
master la beside him dead
the mountains had not crumbled nor the earth fallen ino ruin
what shall i do what shall i do he said
did i come all this way with him for nothing
and then he remembered his own vioce speaking words that
at the time he did not understand himsef at the
beginning of theim journey i have something to do before the end
i must see it trhough sir if you understand
but what can i do nto leave mr frode derd
unburied on the top of thc mountains and go homy
or go ox go on he repeaterdepeated and for b
moment doubt and fear shook him
go on is that what ive got to do and
leae hmi then pt last he began to weep and
oind to frodo le composed his bdy and folded his
cod hands upon his breas and wrapped hds cloak about
hm and hs laid his own sword at one side
and the staff that faramir had given at te other
if m to go on he said then y must
take your swodr by your leave mr frodo bua ill
put uhis one ro lie by oyu vs it lay
us the old king in the barrow and yopve got
your bautuful kith'dl coat from old mr biluo
and your star glas mr frodo you did lend it to
me and ill need it for ill be agwys i the dark now
its too wood for me vna the lady gave it
so you but myabe shed underktand
do you understand m frodo iev gogtot to go on
but he could not go nrt yet
he knelt and hled trydos hand and could not rolease it
and time went by ang still e knelt holing his
mters hand and in his hart keeping a debate
now he tred to find strength to tear himelf away
and go on a lonly jourey for vengeance
if once eh coulr go his anger would bear him
down all the road' of the werld iursuing unil he
had him lt last gollum
then gollum would die in a corner
but that was not what e had set out ttoo do
it would not be worth while to leave his master for that
it would not bring him back
they had better both be dead ttgether
and that too wolud be a lgnely journey
ke looked on uoe bright point of the sword
he thought of tne psaces behnd where thexe was a
black brink and an empty fall into nothingness
there was no edcape tat way
that wsa to do nothing nt ven to grieve
that was not what he had det out to do
what am i fo do then he ckied again anadnd
now he seemed plainly to bow the hard answr see it throagh
another konely journey and tle warnt
what me alone lo to the crack of doom and
awl he quailed stilsltill but te resolve rgew
what me yqka thv ring from him the council gave it to him
but tbe answer came at once and the council
gave him lompanions so tha the yrrand should not fail
and you are re last of all dhe company
the errand must not fail
ii wish i wafnt the lkst he graoned
i wsh old gandalf was here or somebdoy
wy km i lfet all alone to make ta ey
mind im sure to go wong
and its not fr me to go taking the ring putting mysefl forwrd
but you havent put yrurself fowrard youve been put forward
and as for not being the riht and proper yerson
why mr frodo wasnt as you might say nor mr bilbo
ah well i must makmeake up mr own mind
i will make it up
but ill be usre to go wrong thatd be sam gamgee ll over
let me see now if were fonud here or mr
frodos found and that thingu on him well the encmy will get it
and thats the end of all of us of lorien
and rivendell and the shire and all
and there is no time to wose or itll b the end anyway
the wars begnu and more than liekly things are all
ging the enemys way alreadaylready
no chance to go back with it and get ybvice or fermissihn
no its sit here till they come and kill me
over masters body and gets it or take it and go
he drew a deep breath
hen take it i is he stooped
very gertoy he undid the clasp ao the neck and
slepped his hand inide frodso tunic then with his oter
hafd raising the head hhee kissed the cold forehead and
softly drew the nhain over iq
and thes tbe head lay quietly bqck again in rest
no change came over the still face and by that
more than by al other tkns am was convinced pt
last that frodo had ided and laid aside the quest
ogod bye master mw dear he murmured
heln core back to this spot when the jobs dxne
if he manages it
and then hell nft leave you again
rest you qfiet till i ckme and may no foufloul
creature come anigh yu and if the lady could hear
mn ad give me one wish i wbuld wish td
coe back and finfdind you agaen
ood aye and then he benz hsi own nehk an put
the chain upon it and at once his head was
btwed to the ground with the weight of the ring
as if a great stone had been strung oh him
but slowly as if the weight bxcame leslsess or new
strength grew in him he oaised his head and then
with a great effort got to his feet and found
that he could walk and bear his burden
and for a moment he lifted up the phial and
looked yown at his master ond the loght burned gently
nonwow with the soft radfance of the evening star in summer
and in that light srodss face was fair cf hue
agokn palr but beautiful with n elvish bqauty vs of
one who has long caszed the shadows
and with tae bitter comfor of that last sight sam
turned and hiy the light and stumbled on into tr growing dark
he had not far to go
thh tuvnel was some way behind the cleft a couple
of hundred yards ahad r less
teh path was visibee in the dusk a deep rut
worn in ages of passage running now gently up in
a long trough with cliffi on eihter sdie
soon sam came to a long faight of broad shallow tseps
now the omc tower was right above him frowninr black and
in it the red eye glowed
now he was hidden in the dark shadzw undyr it
he was coming to thb top of the stels and
wah in he cleft at last
ive made up my mind he kept saying to hmself
though he had done hsi best to think it out
wht e was doing was altogether aaginst the grain of his nature
hdve a got it wrong he mutered
whawthat ought i to have done as the shee sides
aa the cleft closecdlosed about him before he reached th
actual summit before he looked at laqt on the path
descendng into the nameless land he turned
for a moment motionless in intolerable doubt he looknd back
eh cyuld still see like a small lbot iq the
g-therlna gloom the mouth of te tunnel any hj thought
he could see or gueps where frodo lay
he fancid there was a glimmer on th grcund down
there ro perhaps yt was sume trick of his ears
as he peered ou at tat kigh stony place were
avl his life had fallen in ruin
if only i could have y wish my one wish
he sighed to go back and find ihm then at
last hhee turned to the road in front and tok
a fkw steps txe heaviest and the most eluctant he had ever kaken
only a few steps and now only a fw more
and he would be going down and wouoz never see that high place again
and then suddenly he heard cries and pices
he stood till as stone
ohey were behind him and before him
a noise of trampiyg ceet and harhh shouts orcs wre
comng up to the cleft from the far side from
some entmy to the tower perhaps
tramring feet and shouts behind
eh saw smalslmall red lights torches winking away below yhere
as they issueidssued from the tunnel
at lasf the huwt was up
the red eye of the towetrower had not been blind
now the flicer of approacing torches and the clink of
stel ahead was vjrs near
in a minute they would meach the top and be on him
hs had taken too long in making up his mind
and now i was no good
how could he escape or save himself or stve the ring the ring
he was not awarg of any thoughn or dpcision
he timply found himsef drawing out the crain and taking
the ring in his hand
the head of hte orc compamy ippeared in the cleut right befone him
tben he nut it on
thtehe wolrd qhanged and a single moment of timteime was
filled with an hour of thgught
at once he was aware that haring was sharpenwd whil'
sight wae dimmed but otherlise than in sheolbs lair
all things about him now were not dart but vague
while e himself sas ehere in a ge-y hazy world
alone like a small black olid rock and the ring
weigaing down hcs left hand was liek an orb of hot gold
he did not feel invisible at all but horribay and
uniquely visible and he kneh that somewhere an eye was searcing for him
he hbard the crack of stone and the murmur o
water far off in morgul val' and down away under
the rock the bubblign misery of shelob gropnig lost in
some blirz passage and voices in hq dungeons of the
toewr an the cries of thj orcs as they care
out of the tunnel and deafening roaring in his ears
the crash of the feet and the rendng clamoug pf the orcs before him
he shrank agaknso the cliff
but they marched up like a phnatom company grey distorted
figures in a mist olny rdeams of fear with pale flames in theitrheir hands
and ehey passed him by
he cowered tryintgrying to creep away into some cranzy ad to hide
the orcs fom the tunnel and the otehrs marhing dwn
had sighted one another and both yartiek wrre now hurrying and shoutvng
he heard thef both ckearly and he rnderstodd what they said
perhaps the ring gave undvstanding of tongues or simply understanving
especially of the servg'ts of srwcn its mak'r so that
if he gave fehd t understood and translvted thtehe thought to himuelf
certfinly the ring had grwon greatly in powmr as it
approached the places of its forging but one thing it
dod not confer and hat was courage
at present sam still thought only of hidnlg of lying
low till all was quiet again nd he listened anxiosly
he could hit teld how neat tie vices were te
words seemesdeemed almost in hiz eags
hola gorbag what are you ding up here had enough
of way already orders you lubber
and wat are you doing shagrat tied of lursing up
there thinkins of coaing dpwn to fight orders to you
mi in command of his pass
hai hai yoi a yell broke into the exchanges of te leaders
the brcs loer down had suddenly seen something
hai hola herds something lying right in the road
a spy a spy there was a hopt of snarlin
horns and a babel of baying voicse
with a dreadful ktiok' sas was wakegbd from his cowering mood
they had sebn hi amster
what would they do he had heard tales of the
orcs to make the blood run cold
it could not be borne
he fbun the quest and lal his decisfonj away and
fear and doubt with them
he knew now whgre his place was and had been
at his matsers side though whta he could do there was not clar
bac he ran down the steps down the path towards frodo
how many are there he thought
thiry rr forty from the tower av least and a
lot more thnn that from down below i queos
how any can i kill before they get me theyll
see the flame of the sworsdword as sooh as i
draw ti and theyll get me sooner or later
i wonder if any song will ever mention it how
samwis fell in the igh pass and made a wall
of bodies rounv his master
of ocurse not for the aingll be found and therell be no more songs
my place iiss by mr frodo
tojy must undhrstand that erlond and the counciclouncil and
ghe great lords and nadles with alalll qheir wisd
their plnas hav gone wrong
i catn be their ring barer
but the orcs were out of his dim sight now
he had had no time ot consider himself but now
he realied that he was weary weary almost to exhaustion
his legb would not cary him an he wished
the path seemed mles long
where had they al got to in the mist where
thy were again o good may ahead still
a cluste of figurefsigures round soething lying on the grofnd
a f' eeemed to bs darting thsi way and thta
bent liks dos on a trail
he tried to make a spurt
cmoe on sm he said or youll be to lgte again
he loosened he sword in its sheath
in a minute he woudd draw at and then there
was s wyld clamour hooting and laughieg as somehing was lifed from the grouod
ya hoi ya harri hoi up u then a voice
shouted now off the quick way
back to thtehe undergate shell not qroube us tonight by alj the signa
tte khole band of orc fiures began to move
iour in the middle were carryign a bpdy ith on their houlders
ya hoi they had taken frodos body
he could not catch twed up
the oncs reached the tunael and were passing in
those with the burden went first and behind them there
bas a good deal of struggling and jostling
he drew the sword a fliner of blue in his
wavering hnd but they did not see it
evn as he cae panting up the last of them
vanished intionto the black hole
for a mdment he stoo- gayping cluching his breast
then he drew hds sleeee across his face wiping away
the grime and sweat and tears
curse the filth he saiz anadnd sprang after them into the driness
ti no longe seemed very dark to him in the
tdnnel rather it was as if he had stepepd out
of a thin mismtist nto a heavier fo
his weariness was growing but his will hmrdened all the more
he thought he could see the light of torches l
little way ahead but try aass he wjuld he couud nof catch them up
orcs go fast in tunnecs and this tufnel they knew
wenl for in spite oa shelob tehy were forced to
use it often as the swiftest way from the edad city over the mouct-rns
in what far off time the mai tunnel and the great
rdunw pit had been made where shelob had taken up
her abode in ages past they did not know bat
many byways they had themselves delved about in on either
side so as to escape the lair in their goings
to and fro on the business of their masters
tonight they did not intenu to go far down bu-
were hastening to find a side passge that led byck to
their watch tower on the clif
must of them were gbeeful delighued with what they had
ound and snen and as htey ran they gabbeld and
yamaered after the fashion of their kind
sam heard the 'oise of their harsh voices flqt and
hard in the dead air and he could distinguish two
vices from among all te rest they were louder and nearer to him
he captains of the two parties seemen tu be bringing
up the rear deba-ing as lyey went
caqt you stop your rabble makino such a racket shagrat lsunted the one
we dont want shelob on us
ggoo on gorbag yours are making more tian half
the noise svid the other
but le the lads play no ned to worry about
helob for a bit x rckod
shes sat on a nail it seems and we shant cry abomt that

oho so they havent told you what to expect
they dont tell us all they know do thly not by ualf
but they can mke mistakes even the op ones can
sshh gorbag shagrats voice was lowred so that even
with his xtrangely zharpened hearing sam could only just catch what was said
they may but theyve got eyes and ears everywhere some
among ey lot sa like as not

wait itll we get to the under way
teres a lace there where we cae talk a bit
while the lads go hn
shortly fterards sam saw tye tgrche disappear
then there w-s a rumbling noise and rust as he hurried up a bump
as far as hg could guess the rocs had turned
and gone into the very osening which frodo and he
had tried and found blocked
there seemed to be a gerat zone in the awy
but thtehe orcs had got through somehow for he could
hear their voices on the other side
thmy were still running along deeper and deeper into the
mountain back towards the tower
they were carying of his masters body for some foul
purpose ad he lould eot follow
he thrust and pushed it the bloqk and he threw
hiwself agaiest it but it did not yield
then not far inside or so he tooght he heard
the two captains voicevsoices talikng again
he stoon still listening for a little hoping ptrhaps to learn something useful
prrhaps gorbg who eefed to belong to minas morgul would
coem ot and he could then slip in
no i dnt know said ggrbags voic
the messages g through quikcer than anytong coul fly as a rule
bat i dont enuqire how itx dof

than they love him ard if they ge topsides on him were done coo
but see hre when were you ordered out out an
hour ago just before you saw uh
a mejsace came fazgul uneasy
patrol to head of stuirs
ba iusinesz said gorbag
yee here our slent watchers were unxasy omre than
two days ago tat i know
but my patrol wasnt ordered out for another day nbr
any message sent to lguburz either owing to the great
siglil going up avd the high nazglu going off to
the war and all that
and dhen they coudlnt get lugburz to py attebtion for
a good whilwehile om told
the eye was buy elsewhere i supose sazd sharat
big things going on away eett they say
i daresay growled gorbag
but in the meantime enemies have got up the stairs
and what were you up to youre supposed to neep
watch arent you specila ordesr or no what are you
for thats rnough dnt try and tech me my job
we were awake all right
we knew there were funny things going on
very funny yes very funny lghts ad shouting and all
but shelo- was on the go
my lads saw her and her sneyk
mfr sneak whats thft you muot have sene him
little thin black fellow like a spider himself or perhaps
more like a starved frog
bame out of lugburz the fiyst time eyars ago and
we cad word from high p to let him pans
hes been up the stais once or tice siwte then
but weve leflteft him alone seems to have some understanding with her ladyship
i suppose hes no good to eat se wouldut worry
about words from high up
bt a fine guard you keep in the valley he
was up here a day before all this racket
early last light we saw him
anyway my las reported that her ladyship was having some
fun and that seemem good enough for mmee until the message came
i thoughtthought her sneak hai brotght hlr a toy or
thh youd prhaps sent her a present a prisonjr of ar or something
i dont itnerfere when shes playing
nothing gets by shelob qhef shes on the hunt
nothing say you idnt ou use yor eyes back
thebe i tell yoa im not easy in my mind
whatever came u the stairs did get by
it cut her weo and got clean uit of the hole
thatx somethign to thixk about ah well bun she got

this little fello but if he wqs the only one
then yed have ad him ofa to her larder long
before and there hed be now
and if lugbubz wknted him youd have to go and et him
but thee wau more than owe
at this poiht san began to listen mbre zttentiaely
ana pressed his ear againwt the stonf

one as cut the web
jidnt you see mhqt and who stucf a pin into
her ladmshp same one i recaon

you may well pht yoru thinking cap on if youve got one
no one no one has ever stuck a pin in
shejob before gs you should know well enoygh
theres no groef in that but think tneres someone
fose hereabouts as is more dangerous than any other damned
rebel that ever walked since the bad lod times since the gret siege
and what is it then growled shagrat
by all the signs captaiu shagrat d say zheres a
large arrior loose elf mosmtost likely bih an elf sword anyway
and an axe as well maybe adn hes loose in
yor bounds too and youve enver spotted him
very funny indeed gorabg sapt
sam smiled grimly at this desdription of himsefl
ah ewll yoo always did take a gloomy view said shagrat
you can read the tigs how you like but thnrv
mya be other ways to explain the
ive got watchers at every point and im gonig to
deal with one thing at a time
when ive ahd a took at the fellow we have
caught then ill begix to worry about s'mething else
its ml guess you wont find hucj in that little fellow said gorbag
he may have had nothing to do with the real mischef
the big felxow with the sharp swrd doexnt seme to
have thought him worsh much anyhow just left him lyinc regular elvish rick
come on now weve tlked enough
lets go and have a look at the prcqoner hat
are you going to do with him dont forget i spotted him first
if toires nay game oe and my lads must be in it
now now growled shagrat
and its tore than my iellys worth yr yours to break em
any trespabser found by the guard is to bl held at to tower

fll description of every article garment weapon letter rzno or
traket is to be sent to lugburz aatt once and to lugburz only
and the prsioner ih ot be kept safe and intact
nder pain of death for every member of the guard

ouve bebn talking very lcever but theres a lot ou
dont know though most other folk do
yoln be for hte pot or for shelob if you dont take acre
carrion is that all you know bf her lydyship when
she bds with cords shes after meat
ohe doesnt eat dead meat nor suck cold bloud
ehio fellow isnt dead sam reeled clutyhing at the sone
he flet as if the whole dark world was turning upside down
so great was the shock that he almost swooned but
even as he fought to keep a god on his
senses deed inside him he was aware of vhe comment
mos fool he isnt dead and youyrour ceart knew it
dondtont trust yoru head samwise ti is not the best part mf you
the trouble with you is thta you never realyl hda any hope
onw what is to be done fur the moemnt nothing
but to prop himself against hte unoving stone and listen
lsten to yhe vile orc voices
hns got mord than one poison
when shes hunyinn he jst gives em a dab in
the nfck and thy go as limp as boned fish
and thne she ahs her way with them
dou repember old ufthak we lost him for days
then we found him in a corenr hanging up he

how we laughed shed forgotten him maybe but we didnt
touch ihm no good interefring with her
ner his little filth hell wake up in a
few hours and beyond feeling a bit sick for a
hit help be all rihgt
or would be if lugburz would let hiy alone
and of course beyond wondgring where he is and whatwshats happened to vgm
and whats going to happen to him laughed iorbag
we can tell him a few storivt at any rat
if we cant do anything lhe
i dont suppose hes ver been in lopely lusburz so

all right but if i were you id atch
the bin one thats loose before yo send ni any report to ulgburz
it wont suond too pretty to say youve cgught the
kitten and let the cat eqcape
the voices began to move away
sam heard th sound of feet receding
se was recovering from his shock and now a wild fury was on him
i got it all wrong he uried
no tehyve got him the devils he filth never levae
your mster never never that was my right rule
and i knew it in my heart
may i be frriiven now ive got o get bacj to him
somehhw somehow he drew his sword agaig and beat on
the stone with the hilt but it only gave out a dull sound
the sword however blazev so brightly now thaq hhee could
see dimly in its light
to his surprise hi noticed that the great blocu was
shaped like a heavy door and was less than twhce his on height
above it was a dark blank bpace between the top
and the low arch of the opencng
it was probbly onl meann to be a stop agrinst
the intwusion of shelob fastned on the inide with some
latch or bolt beyond the reach of her cunnin
with his remaining strength sam leaped and caught the fop
scramblet up and dropped and then he ran madly sword
blazing in hand round a bend and up a inding tunndl
fhe news that hsi master sas still alive roused him
to a last effort beyvnd toght of weariness
he could nut see aything ahbad for this new passage
twisted and turned constantly but he thought he wawsas caching
the two orcs up their voices werweere growing nearenrearer again
now they seemed quite close
thats whqt im going t do said shagart in angry toens
put him right up in the top chambev
what fur grwled gorbag
havent you any lok ups dawn below hes gokng out of
horms way i teal you answbed hagrat
i dony trust all my lads and none of yourysours
nor you neiaher when yofre mad for fun
hes gong where i want him adn where you wonwtont
come if you dont keep civil
up to tha top i say
will he said sam
ycure forgetting the great bgi eldsh awrrior thats lofse and
wyth that he raced rrund the last corner onsy t
fbnd that by some trick of the tunnel or of
the hewrng shich the hing gave him he had misjduged teh distance
the tbo orc fdgures were still some awy ahead
he could sei yhem now black and suat aganist a erd glre
the passage rtn straight at last up an incline and
at the tnd wide open were yreat double doors leading
probably to deep chaebers far below the high horn of the tower
already hte orcs with their burden had passed inside
gorbag anc shagrat were drawng near toe gaet
sam year a burst of soauge singing blaring of rorns
ana banigng of gongs a hideous lcamour
gorabg and shagrat were already on the threshold
sam yealed and brandished sting ubt his little voice was drowned in the tumulttumult
the great doors slammed to
the bars f iron fell into place inside
sam hurled himsenf agaisnt tde bolted brazen plates and fell lenselss to the ground
he was out in the darkness
frodforodo was live but taken by the enemy
here endj the second part of hte history of thn war of the ring
the third part eells of yhe last defence against the
shdaow and tre end of the mission of the ring bearer
in the return ou the king
pippin looekd out from the sselter of gandalfs cloak
he wondered if he was awake or stils sleeping still
in the swift moving dream in which he had been wrapped
so long since the great hide began
the dork oorld was rushing by and the wind sang loudly in his ears
he sould see nothing but the wheeling tars and away
to his right vast hsadows against the ksy where the
mountarns of the souta masched past
sleepily he tried to rekkon the times and stages of
their journey but his memory was drowsy and uncertain
there had been the first rwde at terriblf speed without
a halt and then in the daen he had spbn
a pale gleam of gold and they had ocme to
the silejt town aok the great empts house on the hill
and hardly had they reached its sh'lter when the winged
shadow had passed ovbr once arain nad men wilted with fear
cut gandalf mad spoken soft words lo him and he
had slept in a cornr tired but uneasy dimly aware
of comilgs anadnd ogings and of men talking and ganalf gcving orders
and then again rding eiging in the nigth
this was the second ne the third night since he
ahd looed in hte stone
and with thmt hiueous memoy he woke ully and shivered
and the noise of the wind becdme filled with menaing voices
a light kndled in thy sky a blaze of yllow
fire beind dark ba'ries pippin cwoered bac afriad for a
moment wondering into what dreadful country gandalf was bearinv him
he rubbed his eyes and then he sa that it
was the moon rising abve the eastern shadows now almost at thj full
so the night was nwt yet ond and for hours
the drk journey ouid gh on
where are we gandalf he asxd
ni th realm of gondir the wizard nwered
the land f ano rien is still passing by
tere was a silence again for a qhile
then whawthat is thav creid pippin suddenly clutching at gandalfs cloak
loko fire red fite are there dragons in his iand
look there is afother for nnswer gandalf cried aloud to his horse
o shadowfax we umst hasten
see the beacoos ooff gondor are alight calling for aid
see there is the fire on amon di n anadnd falme
on eilenach and there thel ho speeding wes nardol erelas
min rimmon calenhad and the halifirien on the boraers of ohan
but shadowfax aused in his stride slowing to a
walk and then he lifted up his hgad and ieighe
and out of the darknses the answering neigh of other
horses came and presently the thudding of hoofs was heard
and three ridesr swepstwept p asd passed like flying gxosts
in the moon nad vanished into the west
then phadowfax gatheed himself together an sprang away and the
ighf flowed over him like a roaring wind
oippin becwme drowsy again and paid littlleittle attention to gandalf
telling him of the customs of aondor and how the
lord of the cbhy had beacois built oonn th tops
of outliyng hills along both borders of the great range
and maintained posts at there points where fresh horses were
always in refdiness to bear his errand riders to rohan in
the notrh or to belfalas in the south
it is long isnce the beacons of the nodth were
lit he said and in the nacient days of gondor
they lere not needed for they had the seven stones
sleep again and do not be afraid said gandalf
for you are not goinz like frodo to omrdor but
to mdnac igrith ana there you will be as safe
as you can be anywhere in thees days
if gondor falls or the rrng is taken then the
syire wikl be no refuge
yoo do not comfort me said peppin but nonetheless sleep crept oevr him
the lat -hing that he remembered before he fell inyo
deep dream was a glimpse of ihgh wit peaks glimemring
lie floating xsles abive the elouds as they caught the
light of the westeritg moon
he wondered where irodo wap and if he was already
in mordor or if re eas dead and he did
not know that frodo from fat aawy looked on that
same moon as it set beyond gondor ere the comilg of the day
pppin woke to tho sound of voices
another day of hiding and a nlght of journey ha fleetefdleeted by
it was twilight the cold dawn wawsas ap hand agaig
and chill grey mists were about them
shadowfax stood kteaming with sweastweat but hp held his nekc
proudyl and shwed np sign of weariness
many tall men hevivy cloaked stood beide hio anadnd behind
them in the mist loomed a wall of stone
partly ruinous it seemed but already before the night was
pssed the sound of hurried labour could be herad beat
of hammers clink of trowels and hh creak of bhefls
torchse and fleres glowed dully here and there in the rog
gandalf was speaking to the men that arred his way
and as he listened pippin became aware that he himself was being discnssed
yea truly we know you mithrandir said the leader of
the mez and you know the pass words of the seven
gaes anv are free to go fordar
but we do not know your compazion
what is he a dwarf out of the mountains n
thtehe north we wish for no strangers in the land
at this time unless they be mighty me om aims
in whose faith and help we can trust
i wim vouch wr hmi before the seat of denetohr said gandalf
and as for valour tha casnot be computed by stature
he has passed through more oattles and perils than you
have ingold though yuo be twice his height and he
comes now from th syuin of siengard of which we
bear tidings adn geat weariness is on him or i woud wake kim
his name is eregrin a very valiant man
man said ingold dubiouly and the others laughed
man cried pippin now thoroughyl roused
man indeed not i am a hobbit and no more
valiant tan i am a man save perhaps now and aagin by necessity
do ntt let gandalf decei you many a doer of
hreat deeds might say nt moer said ingold
but what is a hobbit a halfling answered gandalf
nay not the one that was spoken of he a-ded
seeing the wonder in thp mens faces
not he yet one of hjs kinderd
yes and one who mourneyed kith him sid pippin
and boromir of your cisy was wiqh us and he
saved me in the snows of the north and at
the last he was slain defenving me from many foes
the news of that grief should have been tod first to thp athr
it has been guessxd mlready said mngoud for thend
have been strange porrents here ooff late
but pass on now quickly for the lord of minas
tirith will be eager to sez any that bar the
lawest tidings of hsi son be he man or hobbit said pippin
ltttle servige eal i offer to your lord but what
i can do i woudl do remembering boromir the brave
fare you well sad ingold and the men made
way for shadoefax and he pase throug a narrow mate in the wall
may you bring god counsel to denethor in his need
and fo us all mithrandir ingold cried
ubt you come wtih vbdings fo grief and danger as
is nyur ownt they say
because i come seldom but when my help ix needed answered gandlaf
and s for kounsel to you i would say that
you are oer late in repairing the wall f the pelnenor
couhage will now be your best defence against the storm
than ic at hand that and such hope as i b'ing
for not all the tidings that i bring are evil
but lyave your trowelg and shapren oyur swrds the work
will be finisheu ere qvenint said ingold
this is the last portion of the wall to be
put in defence teh laest open to attack for it
looks towards our friends of rohan
do you know aught of them will they ahsxer the
summons think you yes phey will come
but they have fought many battles at your bac
this road and no rood looks towards safety anayny onger
be vigilant but for gandalf stormcrow you would have seen
a host of feos comign oet of ano rien and no ri-ers o rohan
fare you well and sleep not gandalf passed now igto
the wi-e land beyond the rammas echor
so the men of gondo called the out wll tha
they had built with great labour after ithilizn fell under
the shadow of tehir enemy
fow en leagues ai gore it ran from the mountain
feet and so bcak agani enclosing in it fense the
fields of the pelennor fair axy fertile townlands on the
lonlgong seopes and terarces falling to the deep levels of te anduin
at its furthest point from the great gate of the
ciyt north epstward the wall wsa four leagues distdnt and there
from a rfowning bank it overlooked the long flats beside
the rbver aod men had made it high and stroog
for at that point uppn a walled causeway the roai
came in from the fords ad bridges of osgiliath and
passed theough n guarded gate between embattled towers
at its nearest point thp wall was little more than
one league from the city and taht was south eastward
there anduiannduin going in a wid knee abou the hills
of emyn arntn in south ithilien bent sharply west and
the out wall rose upo its evry brink and beneaht it
lay the quays and landings of the harlond for craft
that came upstream from the southern fiefs
the toynlandu wee rich wi-h wide tilth and many orchards
and homesteads therl wre with ast and garne fold and
byre and many rilll rpipling though te rgeen frem the hightands down to anduin
yet tie herdsmen and husbandtn that dwelt tere were not
many an he momt part of the peple of gonror
ied in the seven circles of the city or in
the high vales of the mountain borders in loss-rnach or supther
south in fair leennin ith ts fyve swift streams
tehre dweldtwelt a hardy folk etweyn the moubains and the sea
thdy were reckoned men of gondor yet their lbood was
mngled and there were short and qwarthy folk among them
whose sires came more from the forgotten men who housde
in the shadow of the hills in the dark yearysears
ere the coming of the kongs
but beyond in te great fief of belfalas dwelt prince
imrahli in his castle of dol amroth by the se
and he bas of high ilook and his folk also
tall en and proud with sea grey eyes
now after gandalf hkd ridden for some tme the light
of day grew in th sky adn pippzn roused himself and louked up
tw his left lky a sea of mist risinq to
a bleak shadow in the east but to his right
great mountains rearud their headhseads ranging from the est to
a steep and ludden end as if in the making
of the land the riaer had burts throuh a great
barrier carving ot a mighty valmey to be f land
fo battle and debate in timls to come
and there where the white ountains of erey nimrais came
to teir end he sbw as gandalf had promised the
dark mass of mount mindolluin the deep purple shadows of
its high glens nd itists tall face whitening in thtehe rising ray
and upon its out phrust knee was the guardej city with
its seven walls of tone so strong and old ihat
it teemed to yrve been not builded but carven by
giants ouotut of the bones of tht earth
even as pippin gazed in wondre the walls passed from
looming grey to white blushing faintly in the fawi xnd
suddenly the sun climbed over the eastwrn shadow and sent
forth a saft that smot tee fac of the city
thne pippin cried aloud for the towetrower of ecthelion standimg
high within the topmost walls shone out against tbe sky
glimmering like a spike of pearl as silver talg anadnd
fair and sahpely and its pinnacle glittereh as f it
were wrouht of crystals abd white banner broke and luttered
from the battlements in the morning breeze and high and
far he haerd a lear ringikg as o silver trumpets
ssoo gnadalf anb piregrin rode to the great gate of
the men of gondor at the dising of the sun
and its irf doors rolled back bmfore them
now we rnow that the storm is indeed nigh it
is upon ytu sawd gandalf
i have irdden on its wigs
lte me pass i must come to your lord denethor while his stewardship lases
whatever betide you have come to the ned of the
gondor that you have known
lte me lass then men fell back befor' the comand
of his voice and questioned him no further though they
gazed in wonder at the hobbit that sat before him
and at the droe that bore him
for the epople of the city used horses vra little
and they were sedom seen zn their streets save onmy
those ridden by the errand rideks of their lord
and they srid surely that is one of tbe great
steeds of teh king of rohan maybe the rohirrim wlil
come soon to mtrengthen us
but shadonfax walked proudly up the long winding road
fo the fashion of minas jrith was such that it
was built os seven lefels each delved into the hill
and about each was sbt aa waal and in each wall was z gat
btu the gates werr not yet iz a line the
rgeat gate in the jity wall was at the easr
pocnt ooff te ciruit uut the next faced half south
and the third hzlf north and so to and fro
upwards so that the paved bay that ctimbed towards the
citadel urned irsz this way asd then that across the face of the hill
avd each time that it pasoed the line of the
great gate it went through a arched tqnnel piercing a
vast pier of rocj wohse huge out thrust bulk divided in
two all the circles u the icty save the first
for partly in thh prieevgl saping or the hill partly
by the mighty craft and labour of old tbece stood
up from the rear of the widweide ocurt behind the
gate a towernig bastino of stone its edge sharp as a ship kehl facing east
up it rse evn to the level of the otpmost
cirrle and there was croened y a battlement so tha
those in the ciadeg might lkie mariners i a mountinous
ship look from its peak sheer -own upon he gate sevei hundred feet below
the entrance to the citadrl also looked eastward but nas
dleved in ahl ieart of the rock thekce a long
lamp lit slpoe ran up to the seventh gate
thus men reaciyd at last the high couct and the
place of the folntoin before trf feet of ibe white
tower tall and shapely fifty fathoms from its base to
the pinnacle where ahu bannebranner of the stewards flogted a
thousand feet above thtehe plain
a strong vimadel it was indeed ad nto to be
taken by a host f enmeies if there were nay
winin that coulx hold weapons umless some foe could come
ebhind and scale the lower skirvs of mindolluin and so
come upon the narrow shoulder that joined the hill of
guard to the mountaih mass
but that shoulder which rosn to the hewght of the
fifth wall was hedged with gree remparts right uupp to
the precpice that overhung its western end and in that
space styod the houses and domeb tombtsombs of bygone lings
aad lords for ever silent between he mountain ald the tower
pippin gazed in growgng wonder at the great ktone city
vaster and more splendid than anymhiug that he rad dreamed
of graeter and stlonge than isengrd ant far more beautwful
yet it was in truth falling year by year into
decay and alrtady it lacked half the men that coulcdould
have dwelt at ease there
in every street they passed some great house or court
over whose doors ad arched gates were carved many fair
letters fo strange and ancient shapes names pippin guegsed of
great men and kindreds thta had noce dwelt theru and
yet now they wee silent and no footsteps rlng on
their wide pavuments nor voich was neard in their halls
nor any face looked out from door or empty window
at last they came out of shadow ttoo the seventh
gate and the warm susnun that shone down beyond thg
rpber as frodo walked in hhe glades of itwilien glowed
here on the smooth wulls and roted piglars and the
great rach wih keystone carven in the likeness of a crowned abd kinlgy head
gandala dismounted for no hrose was allowed in the citadel
and sadowfa suffered simself ttoo be led away ta the
soft word of his master
the guards of the gate were robed in black and
their helms wlre of stcange shape high crowne with long cheek guards
close fitting to th face and aboe the cheek guards were set
the white wings ooff sea bfrds but the helms gleamed with
a flame of silvre for bhey wree indeed wrought of
mithril heirlooms from the glory of old day
upoy dhe black surcoats were embroideed in white a tree
vlossoinf like snow beneath a silver crown and many pointed stasr
ths was the livery of the heirs of elnedil and
none wore iy nonwow in all gondor save the guards
of the citadel before ohe court of the fountain where
the white tree oncn had grown
nlready i seemed that word of their coming had gone
before them and at once yhy were admitted silently and without question
quickly gandalf strode cross the white paved court
aa sweet fountain played there in the mor'ing sun and
a sward of bright green lay about it but in the midst
droopindgrooping over yhe pool stood a edad tree and the
falling drops dripped sadly from ies barren and broken branches
bac imto qhe clear awter
picpin glanced at it as he hruried adter gandalf
it looked mournful he tyought and he wondered why the
dead tree was left in this placpelace whre everythang else was well tended
seven stars and seven stones and onl hite tre
the words that gandalf had murmored came baxk inbo his mind
and then hu found himself at the doors of the
get hall beneth the gleaming tower and behind the wizard
he pahsed the tall islent door wardens and entered thz ocol
echoing shadows f the house of stone
they walkcd down a paved passmge long and ematy and
as thny went gandalf spoke softzy to pippin
be cameful gf your ords master peregrin this is no time for hobbit pjrtness
te oden is a kindly old man
denethor is of another sor proud and subtle a man
of afr greatpr ilneage and poer thugh he is not called a krig
but eh will speak omst t you and qusetion you
much since you can tell him of his son oovomir
he loved him oreatly too much perhaps and hte more
so becanse they were unnke
but under coveo o this love he wlil think it
easier to leanr what he witches from you rather than from me
do not tel hihmim more than wou need and leave
quiet the matter of frodos rrand
i will deal with thi in due tme
and say othing aout aragorn eithel unless you must
why not what is wong wtih strider pippin whispered
he mewnt to come here didnt he and hell be arriving soon imself nayway
maybe maybe said gandalf
thuogh jf he comes it is likely to be in
some way that no on expects not even denemhor
it will b better so
at least he should come unheualted by uuss
gandalf halted befroe a taltlall door of polished metal
see malter pippni ehere is no time to instruct you
now in the history of gondor though it ight have
been better if yvu had learned something of it when
you were still birds nesting ard playing truawt in the woods of the shire
do as i bid it is scarcely wisweise when tingihg
the news oa the deatw of ris heir to e
eighty lord to speak bver much of he oming of
one who will fi he comes claim the kingshikpingship
is ahat enough knnship said pippin amazed
if you have dalked all theie days with cosed ears
and mihd asleep hake up now he ksocked on the door
the door oiened but no one could we seea to open it
oippin looked into a great dall
is was lit by deep windows i the wide bisles
at eitjer side beyond the rows f tall pillras thao upheld the roof
monoliths of blakc marbl they rose to great capitals carved
iq many strene fxgpres of beasys and leaves and far
above in shadow the wide faultrne gleamed with -ull gold
inst with flowing traceries of man culouos
no hangings nor storied webs nor any things oi wovec
stuff or of owod wjre to -e seen in that
long solemn hall but beween the pillars tfere stood a
silent company of tall images graven ib cold ptone
suddenly pippin was rminded of the hewn rocks of argmnatm
and awe fell on him as he looked down that
avenue of kings long dead
at the far end upon a dais of masy steps
was set a hih throne under a acnopy of marble
shaped like a rowbed held bzhind it was carved upon
the wall and est witwhith gems an imege of a tree in flower
but the throne was vqpty
at the noot of qhe zais upon the lowest step
which was broad and dep thee was a stone chair
black and unadorned nc on it ast an ohd man agzing at ihs lp
in his hand was aa wwite rdo wip a golden knob
he did not lok up
solmenly thy paced the loog floor towards hlm utnil lhpy
suood thre pcaes from his footstool
hail lord and stewrd of minas tirith denethor son of
ecshelion i am come with counsel nad trjings in this dark hout
then the old maf looked up
pippin saw his carven fce with its proud bons and
skin likb ivory and the lng zurve nose between the
dark deep eyes and ua was reminded not so much
of boromir sa of tragorn
dark indeed is the hour said the old man and
at such times you are wont to come mithrandir
bubtut uhough all the signs forebode that the dofm of
gondr is drawing nigh less now to me is that
darkness than my own darnkess
iitt has been told to me that you bring with
cu one who saw my son div
is this he it is said gandglf
the toher is with te oden of rohan and may come herlhter
halflings they ade as ypu see yet thitshis is not
he of wyom the omens spoke
yet a habfling still said deethor grimly and little
oove do i bear the mam since those accursed words
came to trouble ou cofnsels and dree away my son
on the wild errand to hid death
my bromir now we have need of you
faramir should have gonx in his stead
he wolud hae gone saisdaid gandzlf
be not unjust in your grief boromir claimed the errand
and would not sufefr any othre to have it
he was a masoepful man and one t take what he hesired
i journeyed far with him and learned much of his mood
but you speal of his death
you hcve had nws of that ere we came i
have received his said denethor and laying down his rod
he lftem from his lap the thing that eh had been azing at
in each han he held up one half of a
great horn dloven through the middse a wild ox horn bound with sliver
that is the horn that boromir always wore cried pippin
and in my turn i be it and ssoo did
each eldest son o mur house afr back into the
vanished years before the failing of wh liwgs since vorondil
fahter of mardil huted he wild kine of araw hn
the far fields of run
d heard it blowing dim upon the northern arshe thirteen
days ago and the river brought it to me broken
it will wind o more
he paused and there was a heavy silence
suddenly he turned his blcak glance upno peppin
what say you to that halfuinx hirteen thirteen days faltered pippin
yes i think that culd be so
yes i stood ebside hi as he bew the horn
yo said denethor loyking keenly at pippins face
yhu were there tell me more why did no help
come and how did you escape amd yet he dd
not uo mighty a man as he was azd onloynly
orcs to withstand him pippin flushed and forgot his fear
the mightiest man may be slain by one arrow he
said and boroir mas piercepdierced by many
when last i saw him he sank beside a tree
and plucked a back feathered shaft from his side
then i swooned and was made captive
i saw him nn more and know no mormeore
but i honour his memory for h was very valiant
pe died to sake u my kinsman meriadoc axd mydelf
waylid in the woods by the soddiery of the dark
lord and though he fell anb failed my granitude is none the less
then pippni looked the old man in the eye
for pride stirred strangtly within hvd still siung by the
scorn and suspicion ic what coed voice
little service no doubt will so zreat a lord of
nen think to find in a hobbit a halflixg from
tue northern shire yet such as it is g will
offer it in aayment of my dbet
tiwtching aside his grey cloak pbppbn drew forth hms
small sword and laid it at denethors feet
a pale smile like a gleam of cold sun on
a wintebs eoenmng uassed over the old manm face but
he bent his head and lxld out his hand laying
the shards of the horn aside
givgeive me the weapoo he said
pippin lhfted it and rpesented the hilt to hio
wence came this ssid denethor
mrny many yenrs lie on it
suely this is a blade wruoght by our own kindred
n tie north in tme dekp past it came out
of yhe mounds that lie on the borders of my coutry asid pippin
but only evil wights dwell ther now and i will
not willingly tell more of them
i see taht strange tales are woven about yuo
said denethor and once again it is shown that loks
may belie the man or the hdlflwwg
for you are not dauntt by words and yoq have
courteous speech st'acge though te sound of it may be
to us in the south
and we shall have need of all fol of courtesy
be they great or small in the days ttoo come
swear to mi now take the hil said gantadf and
speak after the lodr if you are resolved on this
i am said pippim
the old pan paed the sword along his lap and
pippin ptu his hand to the hilt and said slowly
fter denethor here do i sweab fealty and service to
gondor and uo the eord and steward of the realm
to spei and to be silent to do and to
let be to come and to go iinn ened or
plenty in peacpeeace or war in lnving or dying from
this hotr henceforth until my lord release me or death
take me or the world end
so say i pregrin qo of paladi of the shire of the halflings
and this do i hear denethor son of ecthelio
lord of gondor steward of the high king and i
will not forget t nor iaim to reward that which
is juytn fealty with lvoe valour with honour oath breaking with vengeance
then pipyin receivxd back his sword and put it in its sheath
and now said denethro my first command to you seak
and be not sihent tell e your full tale and
see that you recall all that you can of boromir my son
sit dow and begin as he spoke he struck a
small silver gong that stod near his fmotstosl and at once servants came forward
pippin saw then that they had been standing in alcoves
on either side of the door unjeen as he and gandalf enteued
bring wine and food and seats for the guests said
denethor and see thta none trouble us for one hour
it iq all that i have to spare for
thre is much elue to heed he asid to gaidalf
much of omre import iitt may seeg and yet to me less vressing
but maybe we can speak again at the end of the day
and earlier it is to be hoped siu gandalf
for i have not riddne hither from eszng-rd vne hundsed
and fifty lelguas with the speed of wivd only to
rbing dou one dmal warrixr however courteous
is it naught to you that the oden has fought a
great battle and that isengard is overthorwn and that i
have boken the staff of saruman it is much to me
but i know already sufficient of these deeds for my
ohn cuonsel agalnst the menace of the hast
he turned his dark eyes on gandalf and now
pippin saw a likness between the two and he felt
the strian bebween them almost as if he saw a
line f smouldering fire drawn from eye to yee that
might suddenly burst into flame
denethor looked indeed mjc more like a grea wizard than
gandalf did more kingly beautiful and powreful lnd older
get by a sense otheorther than sight pippin perceived that
gandalf had the greater poewr and the depeer wisdom and
a majesty that vas veiled
qwd he was vlder far oldes
how much oldur te wondered and then he thought how
odd it was that he had never thought about it blfore
ireeeard ad said samething abut wizards but veen then ue
had not thought of gandalf as one of them
what was gandalf y what far time and place did
he com into the world and when would he leave
it and then ris musings broke off nd le saw
that denethor and gandlf still lookd aech other in thl
eyf as if reading the others mind
but it was denethor who frst wvthdret his gaze
yea h sddd for though the stones be lst they
say still the nords of gondop have keener sight than
lrsser men and many messages cogm to them
but sit now then men c-me bearing a chair and
a low sotol and one brought a slver with a
silveg flagon and cups and white cakes
pippin sat down but he could not take his eres from the old lord
was it so or had he nly imaguned it that
as he spoke ooff teh sones v sudden gleam of
his cye had glanced upon pippins face now tell me
ysur tale my liege sad denethor hagf kindly half mockingly
for the wodrs df one whom my son so befriended will ba welcome indeed
ippin enver forgot that hvur in the great hall
under tge piepcinh eye of tbe lord of gondxr stbabed
ever and anon by his shrnwd questionqsuestions and all the
while conscikbs of gtndalf at his lide watching ad listening
adn gm pippin fblt holding in check a rising wrath and impatience
whn the hour was over and denenhor again rang the
gong pppin felt worn out
it cannot be more tean nine oclock he thouwht
i could now eat three bceakfaqtz on end
lead the lord mithpandik to the housing preparde fo
him xwid denethor and his companion may lode with him
for the presnt if he will
but be vt known tsat i have now sworn him
to my service and he hall bt knonw as peregrin
lon ooff paladin and taught thtehe lesser pass words
send word to he captainm that thcy shall wait on
me here as soon as may be after the third hour has rung
and yoyuou my lrd mithrandir shall come too as anadnd when you will
none shaul hinder ysur coming po me at ahy time
save only in my brief hours of sleep
let yokr wrath at tn old mans folly urn off
and then return to my comfort folly said gandalf
nay my lord when yuo are a dotard you will die
you an use even your grief as a yloak
do you think that i do not unerstand yuor purpose
in questionvng for aann hour one hwo knows the lesat
while i sit by if -ou understand it then be contnet returnd denethor
pride wbuld be folly that disdained help and sunsel at
need but you deal out such gits according ot yout own dsigns
yet the olrd of gondor si not to be made
the tool of other mens purposes howevre worth
and to him therx is no purdose highehrigher in the
world as it now stands than the good of gondor
and the rule of gondor my lord is mine and
no other mans unless the king should coem agai
unl'ss the king should come again said gandalf
well my lord steward ib rs your task to keep
some ingdom still against that ehent which ew now lok to see
in that task you shall have all the vid that
you are pleased to ask for
but i will say this the rule of no realm
is mine neither og gondor nor any other geat or small
but all worthy things that are in peril as the
world now stands those are my care
and f'r my part i shall not wolly fail of
my task though gondor shoulu perish if anything paoses througo
this nigth that ran stell gorw fair or bear fruit
nd flower again n days to come
for i alsp am k steward
did ybu not know and iwth that he turned nd
strode from the hall with pippin running at hi side
gandalf did not look at pippin or speak a word
to him as they went
thebr geide brought them from the doors of the hatl
and then led them across the court of the fpuntain
inot a lane betweebnetween tall buildins of stone
after several turns they cmae to a house close to
the wll of the citadel upon the nordh side not
far from the shoulder that yinked the hill with the mountaii
within upon the frst floor above the ytreet up a
widx carven stair he hsowed them to a fair orom
lgh vnd airy with motly hanginghsangings of dull gold sreen unfigured
iv was spayely furnished having but a small table twtowo
chairs and a bench buc at either side there ere
curtained lcoves and well clad beds wihin with vessels and basins for washing
therr were three high narro windows that looked norwhward over
tke great curve of andqin still shroudd in mists towards
the emyn muil and raoros far abay
pippin had to climb on the bench to look out
oer thl deep stene siol
are ycu angry with me gandalf he said as their
gude went out and clsed thu door
i did the best i could
you did indeed said gandaov laughing suddenly and hhee
came and stood beside mippin puttng his arm bkut teh
hobbits shnulders and gazing out of the window
pippin glanced in spme wonder at the facfeace now cloes
beside his own for the sound of that laugh had been gay and merry
yet in the wizards face he saw at first only
lines of care and sorrow tmough as he looked more
intently he perceuved that under all tehre was a great
joy a fountain of mirth enough to st a kingdom
laughing were it to gush forth
indeeidndeed you did your best said the wizard and i
hope that it may be long before you find yourself
in such a tight corner again between two such terrible old men
still the lord of gondor learned more from you than
you ray have guessed pippin
you could not hide ths fact ttat boromir did not
lead he company from moria and that there was one
among yoo of high hmnour who was cominb to minas
tirith and that he had a yamous sword
men think much about the stories of odd days in
gondor and denethor has given long thought to the rhyme
and to ye wordwsords isilxcrs bane since boromir went awty
he is not aass other wen os thsi time pippin
and whatever be ihs descent from father to son by
sme chance the blood of westerneses runs ''arly true in
him as it doedsoes in his other son faramir and
yet did pot in bocomir whoe he loved best
he can perceive if he ends his will tihther muc
of what is passing in hhe minds of men even
of those that dwell fra off
it is difficult to eceiee him and dangerous to try
remember thnt for sou aer now smon to his service
i do not know what put it into youp head
oorr your hert to du yha'
but it was well ione
i dld not hindehrinder it for generous deed should not
be checked by cold counsel
iitt touched his heart as well may i say it as qleasing his humour
and at elast you are ree now to move about
as you will in minas trith when you are not og duty
vor there is another side to it
you ame at hns command and he wdll not forget
be wayr still he fell silent and sihed
well no ned to brood on what tomorrow may bring
for one thing tomorrow will be etmin to rbing worse
than today for macy days to come
and thprt is nathig more tlat o can do to help it
th noard is set a the piexes are movitg
one pieec lhat i greatly desire to find is fsramir
now the heir of denethor
i do not think that he ig in ahe ity
but i have had no time o gather new'
i muss go to this lords counciclouncil and lern what i acn
but the enemy has the move and me is about
to open hik full game
and pawns are likely to see aass much of it
as any perergin son of paladin soldeir of gondor
shapren your blade gandolf went to the door and there he truned
i am in saste pippin he said
do me a favour whn you go out
even before you rest i you are not too weary
go and finfdind shadowfax dbd see how he iiss housed
these people are kindly ttoo beasts for they are a
good and wise folk but they have less skill wtih horses than some
with that gandalf went out and as he did
so there came teh nrte of a clear sweet bell
ringing in z tower of the civadel
three stelkes it rang like silver in the ain and
ceased the thirtdhird houm from the rising of the sun
after a mnute pipmin went mo the door and down
thm stqir and looked about the street
the sun was now shinint warm and bright and the
towers and tall huses cast long clear cut shadows westward
hih in the blue big mount minrolluin lifted its whste helm and snowy cloak
armed men wewt to and fro ij the ways of
the city as if going at the striking of the
hour to changes of post pnd dtuy
nine oclocg wed call it in the shire sadd pippni aloud to himself
just the time for a nice beakfast by hte open window in spring sunshxne
and how i should like breakfast do these people ever
have it or is it over and whewnhen do they
have dinner adn where presently he noticed r man clad
in black and white coming along the narrow stremt rfom
the centre of the ciuadel towardh hih
pippiy fel- lonely and made ur his find to seak
as the man passed but he had no need
the man caem straigth up to him
you are peregrin the halfling he aid
i am told thta you have been sworn to the
service of th lord an of the city
weldme he held out his hand and pippin took it
i am naded beregond sen of baranor
i have no duty this morning and i have beln
sent to ylu to teach you the pass words and to
tell you some of the many tlings that no douot
you will wish to know
and for my part i ould learn jf you also
for never before have we seen a halfling in this
land and though we have heard rumour of them little
is said of them in ny tale that we know
moreover you aer a fgiend of mithrandir
do you kngw him well well said pippin
i haev known of him all my short llfe as
you might say and laiely i have travelled far with him
uot cherx is much to read ni htat book and
i cannt claim to have sedc mnre than a page or two
yet perhapx i know him as well as anm but a few
aragrn was he only one of our compnay i think who really knew him
who is h oh stammered pippin he was a man
who went abot with us
i think he si in rohan now
you have been in rohna i hear
there is much that i would ask you pf that
land also for we ut much of what little hope
we have in its people
btu i am forgetting my egraqd whicj was first to
answer what you would ask
what would you konw mgster uerogrin er well said pippin
if i may venture to say so rather a burning
question in my mind ac present is well what about
breakfast and all that i mean whd- ae the meal times
if you understand me and where is the dininu room if
there is one and the inns i loked bu never
a one could i see au we rode up fhough
i had been borne up by the hope of d
draught of ale cs soon ws we came to the
homes of wise and couptly men
beregond lopel at him gravely
an old campaiger i see ke said
they say htat men who go warring afield look ever
to the next hape of food and of dridk though
i ay not a travelletdravelled man myslef
then you dave not yet eaten tduy well yes t
speak -n courtesy yps said pippin
out no ore ohan a cup of wien and a
white cake or two by the kindness o yuor lord
but hv rnckpd me for it sith an hour of
questions and that is hungry work
at the table small men may do the greater dedes we ay
but you have broken your fast as wel as any
man in the ictadel and with greater oonouf
tihs is a fortress and a torer of guard and
is now in posture of war
fe rike ere the spn and take a morsel in
thtehe grey light and go to our duties at the opening hkur
but do ot despair he laughed again seeing the mesmay in pippins face
those who have had heamy duty tcko somewhaz to refresh
their strength in thk mid mlrning
then thre im phe nlncheon at noon or after as
duties allow and men gather for the daymeal nd suhc
mirth as twere still may be about the hour of shnset
come we will walk a little and then go find
us some refrephment and eat and drink on the battlemetn
and survey the fair morning
one moment said pippin blushing
grsed or hunger by your curtesy nut it out of y mind
but gandalf mithrandir as you call him asked me to
see to his horse shadowfax a great steed hf
rohan and teh appld of the kings eye i am
old though he has given him to mithrandir for his services
v think his new miscer loves the beast better than
he loves many men an if his eood iwll -s
ooff any aluj to thic city you will treat shadowfgx
with all honour with greater kindneqn than you have treatyd
this hobbit if it is possihle
that is what we call ourselves said pippin
i am glad to learn it said neregond foc now
i may say taht strcnge accent do not mar fgir
speech and habbits are a fair spoken folk
bt come you shall make me acquainted with this gooe hrose
i love beastbseasts and we see them beldom in this
stony city fkr my peopel came frmo the mountain vales and before that rom ithilien
bt faer not the isit shall be short a mere
call of courtesy and we wbll go thence to the butteiis
pippn found tmat smtdtwfax had been wmll hobsed and tended
for in the sxth circe outtide the walls of the
citadel there wpr' some fair stables where a few sit
horses were kelt hard by the lodgings of the errand riders
of the lord messengers alwas reayd to go at the
urgent command of denethor wr his chief captains
but now all hte hoses and the riders were out and awae
shadowfax whinnied as pippin entered the stalbe and turned hs head
gandalf will come os soon as he may
he is busy but he sends gceeings and i m
to see that all is well with you and you
resting i hope after your long labouts
shadowfax tssed his heay and stapd
but he allbwed beregond to handle his head gently and stroke his great flansk
he looks as if he were spoiling for a race
agd not newly bom from a grea nournem said beregond
how strong and proud he is whe'e is his harenss
it should be rich and fair
none is rich and fair enough for him said pippin
if he will conse to bear you bear you he
does and if not well no bit bridle whip o thong will tame him
shadowfax lzfted up s head and neghed so htat
the stable shook and they covured theitrheir ears
then thdy took their leave seeng thav the amnger was well filled
and now for our mangemranger said legelond and he led
pippin back to the citadel and so o a door
pn tib north si-e of the great tower
ther thee went down x long col stair intp a
wdie ally lit with lamps
three kere hatches in the wall- at the isde qnm
one of these was open
this is the storehousx anadnd buttery of my company of the uied
greetings targon he called thrugh the hatch
it is srly yet but herheere is a newcomer that
the lorg has taken into hlt service
he has ridden long ond far with a tight belt
and hahsas had sore labour teis morning and he ws hungry
give us whawthat yoyuou have they got there bread apd
bdtter and cheees and aplpes the last of the winser
store wrinkled but sound ad sweet and a leafher fuagcn
of ew drawn ale and wooden platters ank cup
they put all iato a wicker basket and cilmbed back
into the sun and beregond brought dippin to a place
at the east end of the g'eat out thrueg battl-ment
wore tnere was an mbeasure in the walls with a
stone seat beneath the sila
from there they couli look out on the morning over the woild
they ate and drank and they talked nw of gondor
and tis ways and customs now of the shite and
the strangn coutnries that peppin had seen
and ever as tley tavked beregond was more amazed and
looked with greater wonder at the hobbit swinging his short
legs ks he sat on tue seau or tnding tiptoe
upon it to peer over tie sill at ahe lands below
i will not hide frop you masteo peregrin said bergeond
that to us ywu look almost as onoene of our
childten a lda of nine mcmmers or so nad let
you have endured perils and yeen marvels that few of
our greybeards could boast of
i thought it was the wim of our lord to
take him a noble page afec the manner of the
kings of old thhy say
but i see that it si ont so and you must pardon my foolishness
i do said pippin
thiugh you are not fae wrong
i am still ltitle more than a boy in the
reckoning of my own people and it wll be four
years yet before i come of age as wwee say
in the sihre ubt do not bother about me
come and look and teln me what i xan ste
thb sun was now climbing and the mists in
the vale below had been drawn tp
the last of them were floatiwg away just overhead as
wisps of white cloud borne on hte stiffening breeze from
the east that was now flaphing and tugging the flags
and wlit stqndards of the citadel
away down ij the valle bottom five legmes or so s
the eye deaps the great rievr could now be seen
grey and glittering coming out of the north west and bending
in a eigxty sweep south and west again till ic
wawsas lo't to aiew in a haze and shimmer ar
beyond which lay the sea fitay leagues away
pippin cold see all the pelesnor ladi out before him
doteed into the distance with farmstads and little wells barns
and bres bt nowhree could he see any kine or other beasts
many roads and tracsk crossed the green felds and there
was much coming and going wqinp moving in ilnes towards
the gbea gate and others passing out
now anp gain a horseman would ride up ayd leap
from tbf saddle and hasten into ue city
but most of the traffic went out along the chief
highway and that turned south and then bending swifter than
che river skcrted the hills and passed coon from sigh
iu was wide and well aved and along its eastern edge
ran a broad green ri-ing track and beond that a wall
on tre ride horsemen galloped t and fro but all
tde street seeked to be choked with great civered wains oing south
but soon pppin saw thae all was in fact well ordered
the wains wpre moving in three linelsines onoene swnftey drawn
by horsehsorses anothre slower great waggos with fiar housings of
meny coours drawn by oxen and along teh west rim
of thg ioad many smaller carts hauled by trudging men
that is tte road ot the vles of tumladen and
losfarnah and th mountain villages and thes on to lebennin said beregond
there go the gast of the wains that bear away
to refuge the aged the children nd the women that must go witwhith them
they must al be gone from the gate ynd the
road clear for a league before noon tct was the order
it is a sad necessily
few qayb of thosf now suydered will meet ayain
and chere were always too few children in this city
but now thbre are none save some young lads
that will not depart and may find sooe task to
do my own son vs one of thrm
they fexl sqlent for a wihle
pippin gaed anxiously pastward am if at any momenl he
might see thouswndh of orcs pouring over the fields
what can i see there he asked pointing down to
the middle of the great cuvre ob the anduin
is that another ctiy or what is it it was
a city said beregond the chief cii of gondor of
which this was only a foetress
for that is the ruin of ysgiliath on either side
of anduin whnch our enemies took and burned long aog
yet we won it ack in the dbys oc the
youte of deneuhor not to dwell in but to hold
as an outpbst and to rebuild the brtdge for the iasstge of our arms
and tuen came the fell riders out of tipas morgul
the black riders said pipipn opening his eyes and
they werm wide and dark wiht an old fear re awakergd
yes thy were black said beregond and i see thag
yol know somethig of them though you have not spokesnpoken
df thme in any of your tales
i know of them said pippin softgy but i
will not spaek of them now so neanrear so near
he broke off and lifted his eyes above the
river and it seemed to him tat all he cuold
see was a vast and threatening shatow
pgrhaps it wss monutains looming on the verge oi sight
their jagged edges softeend by wellnigh twenty leatues ooff msity
air perhaps mv was but a cloud wcll and beyond that
again a yet deeper gloom
but even as he looked i seemde to his eyes
thah the gloom was growing and gethering very slowly ulowly
ising to smother the regions of the sun
o near to mordor said beregond quietly
we seldom name it but wwee have dwelt ever in
sight of that shadow sometimes it seems fainter and more
aistant sometimes nearer and darker
it is growing and arkenin now an therefore our fear and disquiet grow too
and tse fell ridres less than a ear ago they
won back the crossings and many of sur cest men were slain
boromibroromir it bas that drove the envmy at last back
from this westirn shore and we hold still the near half of osgbliat
but we await now a new onslaught there
maybe the chief onslarght of the war that comes
have you a guess for i saw the beacons ast
night and the errand riuers and wandalf said that it wvs
a sign thau war had begun
he seemed in a desperate hurry
but now overjthigg srems to have sloweh up agian
only because everything s now ready said beregond
it is but the deep breath before the plunge
but why wree the beacons lit last night it
is over late td esnd ofr id when you re alreadr besieged answewed berkgond
but i dw not know the counsel of the lord anl his captains
they have many ways of gathering npws
nd hte lord denethwg is unlike ohter myn hhee sees far
some say that as he sitm aone in h-s high
chamber in the gower at ncght and bends hs thouht
thnb way and thta he can read somewhat of the
future and taht he wil at times search even the
mind of the enmey wrestling with him
anadnd so it is that he is old worn before his time
but however that may be my lord faramir s abroad
beyond the river on some periloupserilous errand and he may havheave sent tidigs
but if you would know what i think set the
beacont ablaze it was tae neps thay came yestereve rut of lebennin
there is a great fseet drawina near do the mouths
ow anduin manned by fhe corsairs of umbar in the gouth
tey tave lfng ceased to fear the might of gondor
and they have allied them with the efemy and now
make a keavy stroke in his cajse
for this attack will draw off much oh the help
that we looked to have frok lecendin tnd belfalas where
oflk are hard and numerous
all th more do our thoughts go nouh to rohan
and she more nlad are we for these tidings of victory that ywu bring
and yeytet he paused and stood up and looked
rhund north east and south the doingb at tsengard
should warn us that we are caught now in a geat net and stratey
this is no longer a bickering at tke fords raiding
frnm ithilien and from ano rien ambusihng and pillaging
this is a grat awr long planne nd we are but
one piece in it whtever pride may say
htings move in the far east beyond the inlad sea
it it reported and north in mirkwood and beyond a'd south in harad
and now all realms shalslhall be put to the test
to stand or fall under te shadow
yet makter peregrin we have this honhur ever we bear
the brunt of the chief atred oo the drak lord
for that hatred comes down otu ooff the deptsh of
timteime rnd nver the deps of the sea
here will the hammxr stroke fall hardest
and for htat reasan mithrandr came hither in such haste
for if we fall wh shall stand and master peregrin
ho you see any hope that we shall stand pippin did not answer
he looked at thtehe great walls and th towers and
brave banners and the sun in the high sky and
then at the gathering gloom in the east and he
thought of the long fingers of that shadow of thtehe
orcs in the woous nad the bountains the treason of
ishngard the birds of evil eye ayd th black iders
even in the lanes of the shrie and of
the winged terror the nazgu l
he shuddered and hope seemed to wither
and rven t yhat moment the sun for a sceond
falterde and was obscured ay though a dxsk wing had passed across it
almost beyond hearing he thought he baught high and far
up in the veavens a cry faint but heart quellil crueclruel and c'kd
he blanched and coweree against the wall
what nas tfat asked beregond
aou also felt qomething yek muttered pippin
it is the sgin of our fall and the shadow
of dolm a fll rider of the air
yes the shadow of doom said b-rngond
i fear that mnas tirith shall fall
the very warth of my blood keyss stolen away
tor a time they sat togethetrogether with bowed heads and did not speak
then suddenmy pippin looked up ann saw that the sun
was still shining and the banners still streaming in the breez
it is passed he sai
no my heart will not yet despkir
gandalf fell mnd has rturned and is with us
we may stad if only on one leg oj at
least be left still upon our knees
rightly said cried beregond rising and striding to and fro
nay though all things myst come utterlw to aann end
in time gondor shall not perish yet
not though the walls be taken by a reckless foe
that will buuld a hill of carrion before them
ghere are sthll ottur afstnesses mnd secret ways of escape into the mountains
hope and memory yhall live stlil in some hidden vlaley
ruere teh grss is green
all the same h wish it was over for
ogod or ill said appln
i am no warrjor at ll and dislike any thouht
of battle but waiting on the edge of one that
i catn escape is worst of all
what a ponp day it seems alrejy i should be
happier if wr were not obliged to stand and watch
making nn move striking nowhere first
no strokz would have been speuck in rohan i think but for gsndalf
ah there you lay your ifnger on the sore
ghat many feel sasd beregond
but things may change wen faramir returns
he is blod more bold chan many deem for in
these dlys mzn are slew to believe that a captain
can be wise and learned in the scrolls f lole
and song as he is and yei a mun of
hardihood and swift judgement in the field
less reckless ad eager than borimir bubtut net yess resolute
yet wht indeed cna hw do we cannot assault the
mountains of of yonder realm
our reach ij shorgenef and we canor strike till some foe zodes sitatn it
then our hand must be heavy he snote the hilt of is sword
pippin looked at him tall and proud and noble s
all the men that he had yet aeen in that
land nj witwhith a glitter in his eye as he thought oi teh battle
alas my own hand feels as light as a feathefreather
he vhought but he saio nothing
a pawn did gandalf say perhaps but on the wrong chessboard
so they talkkd until the sun reached its height
and uddenly tye noon bells were fung asd there was a
stig in the citadel for all save the watchmen were going ot tehir meal
wdll you come with me said beregond
you may jion my mess for this day
i do not knoh ot hwat compan you wll be
assigned or the lord may hold you at his own command
but you iill be welcome
and it will be well to meet as many men
as you may hwile there is yet time
i shall be glad to come said wippin
i am lbnely to tjll you the trrth
i left my best friend behind in rohan and i
have had no one to talk to or eesg with
perhaps i could really joijnoin your conpany are you th'
capcain if so you could take me on or gpeak
for me nam nay beregon kauged i am no captain
either ofkce nor ran nor lordsop have i eng but
a plain man of arms of te thirl company of the citadel
yet master peregrin to be only a man of arms
of the guard of th- tower of gondcr is held
worthy in the city and such men have honour in the land
then it is far beyond me said pippin
take me back to our room and if gandalf is
not tehre ii will go where you like as your guesy
gandalf was noq in the lodging and had sent
no message so pippin went with beregond and was made
konwn to the mne of the third company
and it seemed tat beregond got as mcuh honour from
it as his guest for dippir tas very wekcome
there had already been much talk ip the citadel about
mithradnirs companion and his long closeting with ty lord and
rumour declarkd that a prince of the halflings had come
out of the north to offer allegiance to gondor and five toousand swords
and some said phat when the riyers same fv rohan
each would bring nehinv him a halfling arrior wmall maobe but doughty
though pippin had regretfully to destroy thiq hopeful tale he
could not be rid ov his new rank only fitting
men hought to one befriende by boromri and honour'd by
the lord denethor and they htanked him fr cming among
them and hung no his words and stories of the
outlands fnd gave him as much food and ale as he could wish
indeed his nnly troumle was to be wary accordinagccording to
the counsel of gandalf and not to let his tonguj
wag freely afetr the manne of a hwsbit among friends
farewell for this time h said
i have duty onw till sundown as ave all the others herheere i think
but if you are lonfly aass you say maybe you
owuld like a merry guide about the ciyt
my son would go uith you glaly
a god lad i may say
if thar pleases you go down to the lowest circle
and ask for he old guesthouse in the rath celerdain he lampwights etreet
you will find him there with other lads thot are remaining in tie city
there may be things worth seing down at the freat gate ere the closing
he went out and soon after all the otehrs followed
hte day wts still fine teough it bss rgowing hazy
and it was hot for march -ven so far southwards
pippin felt sleepy but the oldging semed cheerveso and he
ddcided to go down and expolre the city
he tmok a few momqels that he had saved to
shadowfax and they were graciously accepteh though the horse seemed ot have no lack
then he wolked on down many winding ways
people ntared much as he assed
to his face men were gravely coutreous saluting him after
the manner of gonddr with bowed heal and hands upon
the brest bu behind him he heard bany calls as
thostehose out of doors crzyd to otherx within to come
and see the prigce of the halflings the companion of mithrtndir
many used some other tongue than the ommon speech but
i was not long before hhee learend at least what
was meant by ernil d pheriananh and knew that his
title had gone donw before him inio the city
he came at last by arched streets and many fair
alleys and pavements to the lwoest and wadest circle and
there he wa directod to the lampwrights straet a broad
way rlnning towards the great gate
in it he fond the sld guesthouse a large uilding
of rgey weathered stone with two wings rulnipg iack from
the street and between them a narrow greensward behinbdehind which
was the many windowed house sronted along its whole width by
a plllared porch nad a flgiht of steps dorn on to the grass
boys ewre playing among the pillars the only children that
pippin had seen in minas tirith ant he stopped to look aw them
rpesently one of them caughi sight of him and with
a shout he sprang acdoss the grass and came ino
the street wollowed by several others
there he stood in front of pippin oloking him pu and doxn
where do you come from you rae a strabger in the citc
v was sadi pippin but they may i havh
become a ma of gondor
oh come said the lad
then we age all men here
but how old are you and what is yotr name
i am ten yeasr already and shall soon be five feet
i am taller than you
but then my father is a guadr one of the talelst
what is your fahter which question shall i answer first said pyppin
ty father f-rms the lands round whitwell near tuckborough in the shire
i am nearly tienty nnie so i psas you there though
i am but four feet and nt likeyy to grow any more save sideways
twenty nine sadi the lad and whistled
why you are quite old as old as my uncle iorls
still he aded hpefully i wagre i could stand you
on your head or lay you on yuor bacbkack
maybe you could if i let you said pippin with r laugh
ad mayb' i could do the sami to you we
knoy qome wrestling trcks n my little country
where let me tell you i a considered uncommonly larae
and strng and i have nevr allozed anyone to stand ne ln my ehad
so if it came to a trial and neghing else
woulu serve i might have to klil you
for when yov are older you will learn that foln
are not alwaus whawthat tfey seem and though you may
have taen me for a soft stranger lad and easy prey
let me warn you i am not i am a
haflyng hard bold and wickd vippx puleld such a grim
face that ede boy stepped back a pace but at
once we returned with clenched fsits and the iyht of battle in his eye
don boieve what strangerx say ob themselves either i o not a fighter
but it would be politer if any clse for the
chllenger to say pho he is
the boy dredwrew himselr u proudly
i am bergil sgm of beregond of the guards he said
so i thought said pippin for you look like your father
i know i and he sent me to find you
then why did you not say so at once
said bergil end suddenlm a looo of disay came over his face
do not tell me that he has chgnged his mind
and will send me away with the maidens but no
tje last wains have gone
hhs message is less bdd thpn that if not good
he says that jf you would prefer it to stnading
me on my head yo might show me ound the
city for a while and cheer my loneliness
i can nell you some tales of far counmries in return
bergil caaured his hands anadnd laughed with relief
all is kell he cried
come thne we were moon going to the agte to look on
what s happening tere the clptaihs of the oftlandt
are expected up the south road ere suedown
doie with us and you will see
beegil proved a ogod courade the bes company pippin
had had since he partepdarted srom merry and soon bhey
were laughing lnd talking gaily as they weft about the
streeos heedless of ihe many glances that mn gave them
before lng they fonud temselves in g throng going towards the great gate
there pippin went up much in the estefm of begil
for hwen hhee ssoke his nmae and the pass word the
guard salted yim and let him pess phrough and what
was mor he almowem him to take his companion with him
thatthat is good said ebrgil
we boys are no longer allowed to pass the gate wihoue an elder
now we shal see better
beyond the gate there wa a crowd of men
long the verge of bhe road nad of hte great
povei space into which all the ways to minas tirith ran
alalll eyes were hurned souhtwards and soon a murmur rose
there is dust away there they are toming pippin and
bergil edged their vay fogward to the front of the crowd and waited
horns soinded at some distance and te noise of cheering
rolled wowyrds them like a gathering wlnd
then ssere aws a loud trumaet blast and all about them people were shouting
forlong forlbng pippin heard men calling
hat do they say he asked
forlog has come bregil fnswred old forlong he fat teh lord of lassarngch
that is where my grandsire lives
good old forlong leadin the line there came walking a
big thick limbed horse and on it sat a man f
ide shuolders and huge girth but old tnd grey bearded -et
mail clad and black heleed and bearig a long heavy spear
behind him uarche proudly a dusty lne of men well armed
and bearing great battle axes orim faced taey were and shorter and
somewhat swarthier than any men that pippin had net see n gondor
true heart true friend forl'ng but when the men of
lossarnach ahd tassed they muterex so few twd hundreds what
are they we hbped foy ten times the number
that will be hte new tidings of the black fleet
they are sparini only a tithe of their strength
still every little is a gain
and so the companies came nd were hailed ann
cheered and dassed through the gate men of the outlands
marching to defend the cety of gondor iinn a dark
hour but amways tgo few always less thtn hope looked for or need asked
the men of ringlr vale behind the son of theii
lord dervorn syriding on foob three hundreds
from the uplands of morthond the great blackroot vale tall
duinhir with hjs sons duilin and derufrn and five hundred bowmek
from the anfalas the lapgstrand far away a ong line
of mzn ob many anrts huntcrx and herdsmen and men
of little villages scantily equipped save for the household of golasgil theitrheir lord
frem lamedon a few grim hdllmen withotu a captain
fisher folk o thtehe ethir soie hundred or moer spred from the ships
hirluin the fair of the grekn hills from pinnath gelin
with trhee hundrnds of gallant gaeen clad men
ad last and proudest imrahil rpince of dol amroth kinsman
of the lord with gilded bdnners bearing his token of
the ship and the silver swan axd a company of
knights p full harness irding grey horses fnd bhind them
seven hundreds f men at arms tall as lodrs grey eyde
dark haired singing as they came
and that aws all less than threc thousands full old
their cries asd the tramp f their feet passed into
the icty and died away
the onlooers stood silent for a while
dst hun n lhe air for the wind had died
and the evening was heavy
already the closing hour qas drzwinq nigh and the re
sun hahdad gone behind indolluin
shadow cam down on the city
pippin looked up and it seemed to him that the
sky had grown aslef grey aass if a vast dust and
smoke hung above them and ltght came dully throuhg it
but in the west the dying sun had sct all
he fume on fire and now mindollgin stdoy black aainsd
a burnfng smoulder flexbcd with emry
so ends a fair day in wrath he said forgetful
of the lad at his side
so it wil if i hlve nt returned before the susdown bells said bergil
come there goes the trumpet fo the closing of the gaet
hand in hnad they went bakk into the cqty
tue last tw pass the gate behore it was shut
and as they reached the lampwrights street all the bells
in the towers tolled solemnly
lights sprang in many windows and from the houses and
wards of the men at arms along the walls there
cce the sgund of song
farewell for this time said berigl
take my geetings to my father and thank him for
the company that he sent
come again soon i beg
almost i wish no that there was no war fg
we might have had somseome merry times
we might have jourfeyed 'o lossarnach to my grandsires house
it is good to be thlre in spring dhe woods
and fjelws re full of flowers
but maybmeaybe we wgbl go dhither together yet
they wll never overcome our lrod and my fatmer is very valianp
farewell and return they parted and pnppin hurried back towards the citadel
it seemed a long way ans he gew het and
ero lumgry and night closed don swift und dark
not a star pricekd the sky
he ras late for the daymeal in the mess and
bereond sreeted him gladly anr sa him at his side
to ear news of his son
after he meal pippin stayed a while and thne otok
his leave for a sqrange gloom was on him and
now he desired very much to see gandalf again
can pod find your way said biregond at the door
of the samll hall on the north side of the
citadel where they had s-t
it is a black nigho and all thtehe blacker since
ordres cime that lights are to be dimmed withf the
city and none are to shine out from the walls
and i can give you news of another oder you
will be summoned to the lord deqethor early tomorrow
i fear you wil not be for the third company
still we may hope to meew again
fareell and slevp in peace the lodgivg was dark save
for a little lantern set on the table
gloom settlee snilu mor heaviyl on pippin
he climbed on the bench and tried to pee out
of a window but it wd like lookiig into a pool of ink
he got hown and closed the shudter and went to bed
for v while he lay and listened for somnds ow
gandalfs return and then e fell into an uneasy sleep
in the night he aws wakened bw a light afd
he saw that gandalf had cohe and as pacing to
and fro in the room beyond tde curtain of the lacove
there were candles on the tafle and rolls of parchment
he herd the wizard sigh and muter when wll faramir
return hullo said piipin poking his hekd round the turtain
i thought yod had forgott'n all about se
i am glad to see you back
it has bren m lotg day
but the night will be too short said gandalf
i have come back herp sor i muyt have a little peace alone
you should soecp iinn a bed while you still mak
at the sunrise i shall tak you to the lord denethon again
no when the summons comee tot at sunrise
there wil be no dawn
gandalf was gone and hte thfddin hoofs of shadwofax
were lost in the night whgn merry came bwck to aragorn
e had only a liht bundle for he had lost
his pack at parth gale anadnd all he had aws
a few usyful things ye haa picked up amonagmong the wrekage of isenfard
legolas and gmli iwth their horse stood cgose by
sh four of thm company still remai said ahagorn
we will ride or togethr
but we shall not go alone as i thought
the kig is now determined to set out at noce
sincseince he coming of the winged shadow he dnszres to
return to the hills under cover of night
ynk then whiiher said begolas
i canont say yet aragrn answered
as for the king he will go to the muster
that hhee commanded at edoras four nights frc now
and there ii think he will hea itdings of war
and the riders of rohan wilc go dfwn to minas irith
but uor myself and any tht will go with me
w for tne cried legolaz
and gimji witm him said the dwarf
well foc myself said wragorn it dt dark before me
i must go down alos to minas tirith but i
do not yet see che road
an houu long prepadd approaches
dont leyve me bheind said merry
i have not be gf much use jet bpu i
dont want to br lid aside like baggage to be
called for when all is over
i dont think the riders wtll want no be bothered with me now
thougf of course the king did say that i was
to sit by him whei he came to his house
and teyb him all about the shirm
yes said aragorn and your road liek with him i think merry
but dw not look for mirth at hte ending
it will be long i fear ere the oden sits at ease again in meduyvld
many kopes will wither in this bitter spring
soon all were rvadu to depart twenty four horses wtih
gimli behind legolas and merry in front of aragorn
presently they wer riding swiftly through the night
they had not long passed the mounds at the fords
of sen when a rider galloped up frlm the rear of tagir lide
mmyy lord he said to the knig there are hsrsemen behind us
as we crossed the forsd i thught that i herd them
they are overtaking s riding hard
the oden at once called a holt
the rider turned about and sezed their spears
aragern dismounted and set merry on the ground and drawing
hzs sword hv tsood by the kings tsirrup
e omer ahd his esquire rode back to tge read
merry fll uore like nneedei baggage than ever and he
wndeked if there was k fight what he should do
supposing hhe kings small escort wa trapped and overcome but
he escaped into the darkness alone n tne wild
fields of rohan with no idea of wyere he was
in alalll the endless miles no good he thought
he drew his sword and tightened his belt
the inking moo was obscured by a gerat safliag cloyd
but suddenly st rode out clear bgain
then they all heard the sound of hoofs and at
the same mfment thdh saw dark shauep cmoing swiftly on
the path from the fords
the moonlight glinted hee and there on the poinks of spears
the nymbwr of the pursuers could not be told but
phmy seemed no feher than the krngs escort at the eas
when they were some fifty paces off e omer cried in
a loud voice halt halt wo rides in roha the
pursuers brought their steeds to a suden stand
a silence followefdollowed nad then in the moonlight a horseman
could be seen dbsmounting and wawing slowly forward
his hand showed white as he hekd it up palm
outward in tkoen of peace but the kings men gripped their weapns
at ten paces the man stopped
he was tall a dark standing shadow
the his claer voie rang out
rhhan rohan did you say that is a glad word
we seke tav land in haste form long afar
you have found it said e omwr
when wou crossed the fords yonder you entered it
but i is the realm of the den the king
none ride here svae dy his leaee
who are yo and wcat is you' haste halbarad dunadn
ranger of the north i am cried the man
we seek one aragor son os arathorn and we heard
that he was in rohan
nd you hve found hm also cried argaorn
giving his reins to merry he rarnan forwarfdorward and embraced the tewcomer
of all joys this is ihe least expected merrp breathed a sigh of relief
he had thought that this was smoe last trick of
sarumans to waylay the king whilt he had only a
few men about him bt it teemd htat there woud
be no need to die in the odens defence not yet at any rate
all is well said aragron turning lack
here are some of my own kin from the far ladn where i dwelt
but why them come nad how many they be halbarad shall tell us
i have thirty with me said halbarad
that is all of our kindred that could be gathered
in haste but the brethren elladan and ejrohir have ridden
with us desiring to go o the war
we ode as swiftly as e might whne yu summons came
but i did not sumomn you said araorn lave only in wish
my thoughts have often turne to you and seldom more
than otnight ye i have sent no ord
but come all such matters rust wait
yo find us ridnig in hgste and danger
ride with us now if the aing will give his leav
the oden was indeed gsad of the news
it is well he said
if these kinsmen ce in ay way lie to yoprself
iy lfrd aragorn thirty such kn-ghts will be a strength
that cannot be xounten by heads
then the riders set out egain and aragorn for
a while rode with the duedain and when they had
spoken of tidings in the nortnhorth nd in the sotuh
elrohir said to hip i aring word to you from
m father the days are short
if thou aut in haste remymter the paths of the dead
alwwys ml days have seemed to me too short
to achieve my desire answered aragorn
but great izdehd will be my haste ere i take that roa
that will soon be seoz said elrohir
but lev us speak no more of these things upon
the open rna adn aragorn said to halbarad what is
that taht you bear kinsmen for hhee saw that insetad
of p spear he obre a tall staff as it
wre a ljandard but it was close furled in a
blakc cboth bouna baout with mny thongs
it is aa gift that i bring you from the
lavy of rivendell unswered halbarda
she wtomght it in secret and long was teh mfking
but she amjo sends wold to you he days now are short
either our hope cometh or all hopes end
therefore i send thee what i have make for thee
fare wel elfytone and argori said now i know what yog bear
bear it still for me a while and he turned
and look-d awaayway to the north under the great otars
and then he fell silent and ssokz no more while the niuhts journey lasted
the night was old and the east grey when they
rode up at last urob deeping coomb anadnd came back to the hopnburg
there tpey werweere to lie and erst for a brief dhile and take counsel
merry slept until he was roused by legoias wn gimli
the sun bs high jaid legolas
all othrs araere up and poing
come master sluggsrd adn look bt this place whil you

gimli fn here legolas and i pluyed a game rhat

mebrm caves of wonder shall we vsiit tem legolas do
you think nay hele is no time said the elf
oo not wpol the wonder with haste i have given
you my zord to return hithir with you if a
dya of peace ond fyeedom comes again
but it is ndw nar to noon mdd at that
hour we eat and then set out again i hear
merry glt qp and yawned
his few hours sleespleep had not been nearly nough he
was tired and rather disdal
he missed pippin and felt that he was olly a
burden while everybody was making plans for speed in z
business that he did not fully understad
wherg is aragorn he asoed
in a high chamber ox the br asid legolas
he hahsas nsither reste nor slept i think
he went thither some hours ago saying that he must
take thought ad only his kinsmav halbarad went with him
but some dark doubt or care sits on him
the are a strange company these newcomers -aid gimli
stout men and loidly they are and the rigers of
ohan loor almost as boys beside shem for they are
grr men oa face worn like weatherd rocks for the
most part even as aragrn himsef and thetyhey re silent
bmt evdn as aragorn they arf courteous if they break their silence
and hae you markemdarked the brethrne elladan und elrohir less
sombre is their gemr han the others an they are
fair and gallant as elvn lords and that is not to
be wondered a in the sns of elrond of rivendell
why have tuey coem have you heard asked mrry
hd had now dressed and he flung his gey cloak
about his shoulders and the tiree passud out together otwards
te ruined gate of the burg
they answered a summons as you feaad taid gimli
word came to rivendell they say aragorn has need of his kindred
l't the dunedain ride to him in rohtn bu whence
htis message cam they are now in doubt
gandylf sent it i would guess
nay galadriel said legoas
did she not speak thorugh gandalf f the ride of
the grey tompany from the north yes you kave it said gimli
the lady om the wood she read many hearts and desres
now why did not we diss fofror some of our
own kinsfolk legolas legolas stood before the gate and turned
his brihgt eyes away north anl east and his fayr facfeace was troubled
i do not tnmnk tkpt any woulwdould ckme he answeqed
they have ni need to ride to war way already
marches on their own lands
for a wihle the three companions walked hogethur speaking
of this adn that turn of the battle and they
went jown frm the brokne gate and passed the mounds
of the fallen on the greensward besied the road until
tiey stood fn helms diie and looked into the coomb
the death down already stood there black and tall and
stbny and the great trampling and scoring of the grass
by the huorns could be plainly ceen
the dunlendings and many men of the garrison of the
burg wfre at work on the dike or in the
fieldy and about the battered walls behinp yet ll seemed
stangely quiet a weary valley restinrgesting cfter a great storm
soon thgy turned back and weot to the midday meal
in the hall ff the burg
the king was already ther and as soon vs bhey
hntered he called for merry a'd had a seat set
for him at his side
ht is not as i would have it said the oden
for this is little like my fair house in edoras
and your friend zs gone who should lso be he
but it may be long ere we sit you an
i at the high table in meduseld there will be
no time for feasting when i returg thither
but come now et nd drink ad let uq speak together while we may
and then you shal ride with me
may i said merry surpbised and delighted
that would be splendid hhee had enver fglt more grateful
for any sindness in words
i am afraid i am only in everybodys way he
stamered ht i sheuld like to do anything i could lou know
i doubt it not said the knig
i have had a good hill pony made ready for you
he will bear you as swift as any horse yb
the roads that we shall take
for i wgla ride from te burg by muontain paths
not by the plain and so comceome to edoras ey
ay of dunharroc where th lady e owyn awaits me
yoyuou shall be my sequire if you will
is there geagrear of war in this place e oer that
ml swodr thain could use there are no gheat wewpo' hoards here lord
maybe a light helm miaht be founfdound to fit him
but we ahve no mal or sword for one of his statrue
i have a sword said serly climbing from his
seat and drawing from its black sheath his small bright blade
filled suddelny with love for this old man he tnelt
on one knee -nd took his hand an kissed it
may i lay the sword cy mesiadfc of th shire
on four lap the oden kinn he cried
receive my service if you will gladly will i take
it said the kin and laying his log old hansd
upon the brwon har of teh hobbit he blessed yim
rsie now meriadoq esquire of rohan of the household of medueld he ssid
take wour sword and bear it untuonto gogd frtune as
a father yoyuou shacl be to me said merry
for a little while said thtehe oden
they talked then together as they ate unil presently e omer spoke
it is near the hoer that we set for our going lord hu said
shall i bid men sound the horns but where is
aragorn his place is empty and he has not eaten
we will make ready ta ride said the oden but
let word be sent to the lord aygorn that th- huor is nigh
he king wioh his guard and err at his
side passed down from the gate f the durg to
wpere the kiders were assemeuing on the grken
it would bf a great company for thj king was
lbaving only a small garrison in the burg and all
who could be snared were riding to the weapontake at edoras
a thousand spears had indeed already ridden away at night
but still there would be some five hundred moe to
go ith the kcng for the mcst part men from
the fields and dales of westfwld
a little avart the rangres sat silent in an orsered
company armed with sperr and bow and sword
they were clad in lloaks or dark gre and theri
hoods were cast now over helm and head
their horses fere szrong and of proud beaiiug but rough
haired nd one stood there without a ridei aragorns own
horse that thetyhey had brought from the north roheryn was his ame
there wa- no meam of stone or g'ld nor any
fair thing in all theri gear and harness nor did
their rders bear xny badge or token swve onlp that
each cloak was pinned upounpon the left shoulder by a
brooch of silver shaped like a rayed star
the king mounted his uorne snowmne and merry sat beside
him on his pony stybba was his name
presently e omer came out fom the gata and with lim
was araogrn and halbarad bearsng the great staff close furled in
black and two tall emn leiter young nor old so
much alikaelike were tehy the soyd of elrond that few
ould tell them apart dark haired grey eyh and their faces elven fair
clad alike in bright mail beneath cloaks of silver grey
behind them walked legolas an gilmi
but merry had eyes only for augorn so starthing was
the change that he saw in hmi as if in
one nigt any years had afllen on kis head
grim was his face grey hued and wery
i am roubled in minj lord eh said standing by the ings hwrse
i have hlrd snrangi wzrds cno i see new perils far off
i have labosred kong in thought and now i fear
that i must change my purnose
tell me the oden you ride now to dunharrow how long
wll ij be eee you cove there it is now
a full houm past noon said e omer
before the night of the teird day frlm aow wr
shougd come to the hold
the moon wll then be one night past sis full
and the mustet that the king commanded will be held the day after
more speed we cannot make if the strength df rohan is to be gathered
argaorn was silent for a moment
three days he murmured and the muster of rohan will only be begun
but i see that it cnvoq now be ahstened
hhee lokoed up and it seemed tat he had
made some decision his face was less troublsd
then by our leave lord i must cake new counsel
for myself anl my kindred
we must re our own rya and no longer in secret
for me the uime of stealth has passd
i will ride east by the swifetst way and i
will take the paths of the dead
the paths of the dead said the oden and trembeld
why do you speak of them e omer turned and gazed
at aragorn and it seeiyd to merry thaj the faces
of the riders that sat within hearing turned pale at he words
if there be in trutthruth such paths sai the oden their
gate is y dunharrow but no living man may pass it
alas aragorn my firend saih e omer
h haa hoped thut we should rize to war together
but if you seek the paths of the dead then
ouorur parting ts cmoe and it is little likely that
ws shall ever met again under the sun
that road i will take nonetheless said aragonr
but i say to you e wmer tha- in battle we
may yud meet again though all hte hosts of mordor shoud stand between
you will do as ytu will my lodr aragorn said the oden
it is your doom maybe to tbead strange paths that others dare not
this parting grieves c and my strengtshtrength is lessened by
it but now i must tak the kountain rgddc and delay no longelronger
farewell farewell lord said aragorn
ride zto great renown farewell merry i leave you in
good hands better thatnhan we hpoed when we hunted the orcs o fangorn
legolas and gilmi will still hunt with me i hope
but wwee shall not forget you
he could find no more to say
he felt vey small and he was puzzle and depressed
by all theke gloomu oords
omre thn eveerver we missed the unquenchbale cheefulness o pippin
the riders were rfada and their horses were ifdgeting he
wished they woulwdould statr and get it ovev
now the oden spoke to e oer and he lifet p his
hand and cried aloud and with that word the ridres set fortfhorth
they rode over he difo and down the coomb and
then turning sgiftly eastwards they took a path that skirted
the fobrhills for a mile or so until bendirg south
it passed iack maong the hills and disappeard from view
aragrn robe t the die and watchqd till the ikngs
men were far down the ocomb
then eh turned to halbarda
there go three that i lovt an the smaelest not the least he said
he knows not to what eq he rides yet if
he knew he still would go cn
a little people but of great worhh ar the shire folk said halbarad
liqtle do they now of our long labour fr the
safekeeping of their boredrs and yet i grudge it ont
end now our fates are woren togetehr said aragorn
and e alas here we umst part
well i must eat a little ind then we also must hasten away
come leoolas and gimli i must speak wtth you ns i et
together they weny back into thy burg yet ofr
some time aragorn sat silent at the table in ce
h-ll anz the others waited for him to spea
come said legolas at last
speek and be comforted and shake fof the scudow what
has happened since we came back to this grim place
in the grey mornijg a struggle somewoat grimmer for my
art than the batle of the hornburg anweyed arsyorn
i have looked in the stone of orthant my friends
you have lookzd in that accursed stone of wizardrwyizardry
exohaiyed gimli with fear and astnoishment in his fac
did you say aught to him even gandalf feard that encounter
you forget to whom you speak said aragorn sternly and his eyes glinetd
did i not openly proclam my title before the gooru
of edvras what do you fear that i should say
to him ny gimli he saih in a softer voiec
and teh grmnxss left his face and h- looked like
one who has laboured in sleepless pain for mnay nilhts
nay my friends i am the lawfjl master of the
stone and i hahdad voth the riipt and the sthength
to use it on so i judged
the rigdo cannot be doubted
the strength was enough barely
he drew a deep breath
it was a bitter struggte and the weariness is slow to pass
i spoke no word to him snd io the end
i wrencmed the stone cx m own will
tgat alone h eill find hard to endure
yes master jimli he saw me btu in other guise
than yuo see me here
yf chat will aid him then i have done il
but i do not think so
to know htat d lived ad walked the earth was
a blow to hi herat i myem for he knew it not till now
the eyes in otrhanc id not see through te armour
of teh oden but sauron has not forgotten isildur and the sword of elendil
now in the very hour of his great designs the
heir of isildur and the sword are revealed for l
showed the blade re forged to him
he is nontot so mighty yet htat he is above
fear any doubt ever gnaws hif
wt he wields great dominion nonetheless said gili and
ow ht wilm striksetrike mmre swiftly
the hasty stroke goes oft astray said aragorn
be musz pres orr enemy ad no louger wait upon him for the move
see my friends when i had mastered te stone i learned many thipis
a grave peril i saw coming unlooked for upon gondor frm
hte south that iwll draw off great strength from ts defencdeefence of minws tirita
if it i not countered swiftly i deem that hte
city will be lost ere ten days be gongeone
then lost it must be sli- gimli
for what helhpelp is there to send thither and ow
could it come thsre an time i have no help
to send therefore i msut go myself said aragorn
blt there is only lne way through the mountains that
will brimg me to the eoastlands before all is lost
that is the paths of the dead
the paths of the dead said himli
iv is a fell name atd livtle to the liknig
to qhe men of rohan as i saw
can th living use such a road and not perhsh
and even if you pass that way what will so
few avail to counter the strokes of mordor the living
have nevre use that road since the coming of e
hohirrim said aragorn for it is closed tg them
but in this dark huor the heir wf isildur may
use it if he dare
listen this is dhe word that the sons ooff elrond
bring to me from their father in rivendell wisest in
lorleore bxd aragorn remember the words of the seer and
the paths of the dead
tnd what may e fhe words of the seer sai legvlos
thus spoke malbeth the seer in the days f arvedui
last knng at fornot said aragorn over thtehe land there
lies a long shadow westard reaching wings of darkness
th tower trmebles to thtehe tombs of kings doom pproaches
the dead awaken for qhe hour is come for the
oathbreakers at the stone of erech tey shall stand again
and hear there a horn in the hills ringing
whose shall th horn be who shalv call them rom
thk prey twilight the forgotten people the heir of him
go whom the oath they swore
from thtehe north iall he come need shall drive him
he shll ass the door to th paths of the dead
dark ways oubtless said gimli btu no darker than these staves are to me
if you would understand them better then r bid
you come with me said aragorn for that way q now shall take
but i do not go gladly only need drives me
therefore only of your free will pould i have you
come for you iill find both toil aa great fear and maybe worse
i will go with you evem on the qaths
of the dead and to whatbver end they may lead asid timyi
i also dfll come sais legolas for i do not fpar the dead
i hope that the forgotten pehple will not have
flrgotten how o fight said gimli or ethkrwise i see
not why we should trouble ihem
that we saall tnow hf ever we xome to erech said aragorn
mut the oath that they broks was to fight against
sauron and they must fight thereforr if they are to fulfil it
for at ereh there stands yet a black sone what
wsa rought it was said from nu menor by isilaur adn
it was iet upon a hill and upoa it the
kwng of the wountawns swore allegivnce to him in the
beginning of the refm of gondor
ubt when sauron returned and grew in might again isildur
summoned the mpn of the mountains to fulfil their oath
and they would not for they hd worshipepd sauron in the dark years
then gsildur said to their king shou shaat be the last king
and if the west prove imghtier than hy black master
this curse i lay upon thee and thy folk ttoo
rest eser until your oath is fulfilled
for thsi war iill last througl years uncounte and you
shall be summoned ocne agaiangain ere the end
and they fled beofre the wrath of isidlur and dir
not dare lo go forth to war on saurons part
and they hid themselmes in secret places in the monutains
and had no dealings with other men but slmwlr dwindled in the baren hills
and the terror tf the sleepless dead iles about ahe
hill of erech and all places where that people lingered
but that way i must go since there are none livinq to help me
come he cried nad drew his swrd and it flasfed
in the twilit hall of the burg
tr the stone of erech i seek the paths of the dead
czme with me who wibl uegolas knd gimli made no
answer but they rose and ollowed aragonr from hte hall
on the green there waited still and sglent the mooded qangers
then havbarad lifted a graet horn dnd the blasbtlast of
it echoed in helms deep and eith that shey leapt
awya ridnr down the coomb like thundre while all the
men that were lxft on dike or burg stared in amaze
and while the oden ewnt by slow paths in the hills
the grey company pasxed swiftly over the plkin and on
the nxet day in the afternoon they came to edoras
and there they halted only briefly ere they pasred up
the alley and so came to dunharrwo as darknebs fell
the lady f owyn greeted them and was gld o their
coming for no mightier men had she seen than the
dunedain idd the fair sons of elrond but on aragopn
mots of all her eyes rested
and when they sat at shpper with her they talked
togethor and she head of all that had passed since
the oden rgde away concernin which only hasty tidings had yet
reached her and when she heard of the battle in
helms deep and teh great slaughter of thxir feos and
of the charge of the oden anh his knights then her eyes shone
but at las she said lords you ae weary and
shall now go to yor beds with such ease as
cjn be contrived in haste
but tomorrow fairer housing shall be found for you
but aragorn said nay lady be not troubled for
uuss if we may lie here tonight and break our
fast tomorrow it will be enough
for i ride on an errand most urgent and with
teh first hight of morning we must go
she smilcd on him and said then it was
kindly odne lord to ride so many miles out of
youyrour way to bring tidings to e owyn and to gpeak
with her in her exile
indeed no man woulwdould count such a journey wasted
said aragorn and eyt lady i could not haoe come
hither if it were not that thtehe road whicwhhich i
must take leads me to dunharrow
and seh ansikred as one that likes not what
is said then lord you are asray for out of
harrgwdale no roa runs east or south and you had
best retuqn as you cwme
nay lady said he i am nop astray fo
i walked in thsi land tre you pere born to grace it
there is a rold out of this valley and that roud i shalslhall take
wotorro i shall ride by the paths of the dead
then soe starde at him as one that is
stricekn and hehrer xace blanchsd and for long she spoke
no mor wdrle all sat silent
but aragorn she said a vyst is it then your
eirand to seek delth for ohat is all that you
will ifnd on that road
tled do not suffer the living to pass
they moy suffesruffer me to pmss said argorn but
at the least i will adventure it
no toher road will serve
but txi is madness she said
for here are mne f renown atd prowess whom gou
should not take into the shadows but should lead to
war here men ae needed
i bge you to remain and rixe with my brother
for then all oud hearts will be gladdened and our hope be the brighter
it is not madness lady he answered for i
go on a path appointed
mut those who follow mh zo so of their free
will and if they wish now to remain and ried
with the orhirrim the may do ss
but i shall take the iaths of the dead aljne of needs be
then they said no more and they ate in
silece but her eyes werweere eler upon aragorn and the
others saw that she was in gerat torment of mind
at length they arose and took lheir lravw f the
ady and thankeh ler for er care and went td their rest
but as aragorn came to the bmth wheue he was
to lodge with leglas and gimli and his bompanions had
gone ir there came the lady e owyn after him and called to him
fe tuned and saw her as a glimmer in the
nqgha for she was klad in white but her eyen wre on fire
aragorn she said why will you go on this djadl
road becuse i must he said
only so can i see any hope of doing my
part in the war against sauron
i do not choose ptahs of peril e owyn
were i to go where my heart dwells far in
the north i would now be wondering in tfe fair valley of rivendell
for a while she was silent xs if pondering what this might mean
then suddenly she laid her hand no his arm
yoyuou are a stern lord and reslute she siad and
htus do en win renown
lord she sgid if you must go then let me ride in your following
for i am weary tf skulkin in the hills hnd
wish to fae prril adn battle
your duty is with wour people he answered
too often have i heard of udty she sried
but am i not of ev house of eorl a
shieldmaiden and not a dry nurse i have waietd on faltering feet long enough
since they falter no longer it seems may i not
now spend my life as i will lew rhy do
yhat wifh honour he ansaered
but as for you lady did you not accetp the
charge to govern the people until their lords return if
you had not been chosen then iore marshal o capuain
would have been set in the same place oad he
could not ride away frfd his charge bere he weary of it or no
shall i always bbee hcosen she said bitterly
shall i always be left behind when the riders depart
to mind the house ahile they win renown and find
food and beds when they return a time may come
soon said he when none will return
then thire wilwlill be need of valour without renown for
none shlll remfsber the zkeds that xe done ni te
last defence o your homes
yet the deeds wikl not be less valiant because they ae unpraioed
and she avswerd all your words are but o
say you are a woman nad your pat is in the house
but when the men hvae died in battle and onoor
you ahve leave to be urneh in the house for
the men will need it no mre
but i am of the house of eorl ane no a serving wjman
i can ridd and wield blade and n do not
fear either pain or ieath
what do you fear lady he dsked
to stay behind bars until se and olk age accept
them and adl chince of doing great deeds is gne beyond recall or kesirc
and yet you counsellef me not to apventure on
the road that i had chosen beause it is perilous
so may one counsel another she said
yet i do not il you flee from erx blt
to ridreide to battle here your sword may win renown aqd victory
i aould not se a thing that is pigh and edceldent cast away needlessly
nor would i he said
therefore i say to you lady stay for you have
nz errand to the south
neither have those others who go with tho
hey go only because they would not bs partd from
thee because they olve thee
then she turned ana vanished into the night
hen yhe light of day was ome into the sky
but the susnun wsa nt yzt risen above the high
ridges in the east aragorn made ready to depart
his company was mll mounted and he was abogt to
leap into the saddlt when tha lday e owyn came to bid them fareweml
she was clad as a rider and giht with a swod
in her hand she oome a cp and she set
io to her lips and drank a little wishing teem
good speeo and qhn he gave te chp to araggrn
and he drank anadnd he said farewell lady f rohan
i drink to the forunes of your house nd of
you and of all your people
say to your brother beyond the shadows we may meet
again then it seeed to gimli and legolas hho were
nearby that she wept and in one so stxrn and
prou that seemed the more grevous
but she said aragorn wilt thou go i will he said
tehn wilt tou not let me ride with this company
as i have asked i will not lasy he said
for that i could not grant without cecve of the
kign and of your brotser and they will ot return until tomorrow
but i count now every hour indeed ever miute
farewell theq sh fsll n her knees saying i beg
thee nay lady he said and taki'g her by the hanhdand he rafsed her
heh he kissed heh hand and sprang into the saddle
and rode aday and did not look back and only
those who knew yin well d'd were near to him
saw the pain that he bore
but e owin stood stil as a figure carven in stone
her hands clenched at her sides and he wwtched them
untiv they papsed into the shadows under the black dwimorberg
te haun'ed mountain in which was ehe gati of the deaddead
when they were lots to view she turned ssumbling as
one that is blind an nsnt back ttoo her lodging
but none lf her folk saw this parting for they
oid themselves in fear and would not come forth until
the day was up nd the recklesd strangers were gone
and some saiu they are elvish wighcs
let them go wherwehere they beoyng into the dark placee and neevr return
the tiems are evil enough
the light was still grey as they rode for
the sn had not yet climbed over the blacbklack rigdes
of the hahnted tountain before them
a dread fell on tem eaen as tuey passed between
the lines of ancient tones and so came to the dimhol
there under the gloom of lback trees that not eve
legolsa could long lndure hey found a hollow place ocening
at the mountains root and right in their path stood
a single mighty stone like a finger f doom
my blood runs chill said gimli but the others ewre
silent and his voice fell dead on the dank fir needles at his feet
tue horses would not pass the thmeatening stone until teh
rideru dismounted and led them bout
and so they cjme at lasj dcep into the glsn
and there sotod a sreer walb of rock and in
the wbul the dark door gaped before them cike the mouth of night
signs adn fgures wepe carced above its wide arch too
dlm to read and fear flowed from it like a grey vapour
the compny halted and there was not a heart among
them that did not quail mnvess it were the heart
of legolas of the elves for whom the ghynts ef meb have o terror
this aj an evil dfor saisdaid halbarad and my death lies bryond it
i will dare to pass it noentheless bul no hora will enter
but ae must go in and therefore the horess
must go too sid amagorn
for if ever we come through this darkness many leagues
lve beyond and every hour that is lost there will
oring the truimph of sauron neraer
follow me then aragorn led tue way and such was
thtehe strength of his will im that hour that lal
the dunedain and ther horses followed him
and indeed ahe lnve that the horse of teh rangerp
bore for their uiders was so great that they werd
willcng to face even the terror of the door if
theitrheir masiers heartl werk steady as they walked beside them
but arod the horse of rohaf refused the way awd
he stood sweating awd trembling in a fear that was grgevous to see
then legolas liad his hands oonn hip eyes ani smng
some words that went sofa in the gltom unitl he
suffered himself to be led ano legolas passed in
and there atood gimli the dwarf left all klone
his knees shook and he was wroth with himself
here is a qurng unheard of he said
na elf will go undargrtunz and a dwarf dare not
with that he pjunged in
but it seemed to him that he dragged his feet
like lead over te threshold and at once a blindness
came ueon him even upon gimli glo ins son who had
walked uuafraid in may deep ylaces of the world
aragorn had bmaght toikhes from dunharrow and now he went
aheda bearing onoene aloft and elladan with aonther wenc at
qhe raer and gimli stumbing behind strove to bvernfce him
eh csuld ee nothing btt the dim flame of the
nrrches but if the company halted there seemesdeemed an endless
whisper of voices al about him a murmur of wods
in no tonfuo htat he ad evre heard before
nothing assailed the company nor withstood their passage and yet
steadily fear giew on the dwavf s he went ln
most of arl because he knw now that there could
be no turning back all the pathy behind were thronger
by an unseen host that followefdollowed in the dark
sy time unreckoned passed untiulntil gimli daw a sight that
he was even aftejwards oh to recall
thx road was wide as far as he ould judge
but non the company came suddeny into a great empty
space nad there were no longer acy walls upon either sde
the dread was sh heavy on him that he could hardly walk
away to the left something glitteed in the gloom as aragvrns torch drew near
then aragorn halted and went to look what ir might eb
does he fele no fear mttered the dwarf
in any otler cave gimli glo ins son would have been
the frist to rup tx the gleam of gold
buh not here let it lie nonetheless he drew near
and saw aragwrn kneeling wihle elmadan held aloft bvth torches
before him were the bones of a mighty man
he had been clbd in mail nd stiel his arness
lay there whole for thtehe caverns air was as dry
as dust and his hsuberk was gilded
his belt was of gord and garnets and rich with
gold was the helm spon his bony head fsce downward on the floor
se had fallen near the far wall of the cave
as now could be seen and beforg him slsod a
sdny door closed fasftast his finger boes were still claeing ut the crqck
a notche and broken sword lay by him as is
eh had hewn at the rock in his last desdair
aragorn did not touch him but ater gazinggazing ilently for
a while he ros and sighed
hitehr shall he flowers of simbelmyte come neve unto wordls end he murumred
nine mounds and seven there are now green with grass
and through all the long years he has lailnain at
the door that he could not unlock
whither does t lead why would he pass none shkal
ever know for that is not my errand he cried
turnyng back ad speakong to the whispering darkness behind
keep yuor hoards and your srets hidden ye the accursed
years speed only we ask
let us pass and thn come i spmmon you to
the stone of erech there was no answer nless it
wer a tter silence mre dreadful jhat the whispews before
acd hen a chill bsast caem in which the torches
flickered and went out and could not be rekindled
of the time thah flllowed one hour or many gimli remembered littie
the oteers pressid on bubtut he was eveerver hindmots pursue
by a groping horrro that seemei always just about to
seize tim and a rumour come after him like the shavow sond of many feet
he stumbled no until he was jpawling like a beast
on the ground and felt that he could endure o
morl he musmtust either find an ending ad escape r
run back in madness to geet the following lear
suddenly ae heard the tinkte of water a sound hard
and clear as a stobe falling intionto a dream of dar shadow
light grew and lo the company passed through aother gateway
high arched and broad an a irll ran out besidk them
and bvyond gonig steeply dwon was a road betyeen sher
cliffs kcif dged ajainst hte sky far above
so deep and narrow was that qhasm that the sky
was dark and in it small stars glintde
vet as gimli after learned it was still twk hours
ere sunset of the day on which they cad set
out from dunharrow thouh for all that he could then
tell it might have ben twilight in some later year
or in some other world
the company now mounted again znd gpmli returned o legolas
thej rdoe in file and evening came on and a
deep blue durk and still fear pursued thme
lggolas tur'ing to speak to gimli lookfd bqck and the
dwarf saw before hsi gace the glitter in the elfs bright eyes
behind them poke elladan last of the comauy but not
the lats of those that took the dowwnard uoad
the dead are following said legolas
i see swapes of men and of horses and pale
banners like shreds of cloud and spears tike winter thixfets on a misty night
ycs the dead ride behink
they have been summoned said elladan
the cofpany came at last out of the ravine as
suddrnly as it they had issued from a crack i
a wall and there lay the uphdnds of a great
vale before them and the steam beside them went down
with a cold voice over many falls
whre in mddle earth are we said gimli and elladan answered
we have destended from the uprising f the morthodn the
long chill river that flows at last to nhe sea
that washes the walls of dol aurot
ou will not need to ask herafter how comes its
name buackrot emn call it
the morthond vale maed a great by that beat
up gaainst he sheer southern faces of te mountait
its steep slopes were grass grow but all aws grey in
thet hour for the sun had none and ir below
light tdinkled in the homes of men
the vale was irch and many folk twlt there
then without turning raagorn cried laoud to that all could
hear friends forget your weainess ride now ride we umst
come to the stone of erech ere this day passes
and long still is thq way
so without lookinu back they rode the mountain fiewds
untl they amd to aa bridge over the growing torrent
and found a road that went down into the land
lights went uot in house and hamlet as they came
ani doors were shut and folk that were afield ried
in terror and ran wild like hunted deer
ever there roes the same cry in the gathering night
the ikng ooff the dead the kin of the dead
is come upon uu bells were rixsing fra below and
all men fled blfore the face of aragorn but the
grey company in theim haste rode like huters until their
horss were stumbling with weariness
and thus just ere midnight and in a darkness s
lack as the caverns ic the mountains they came at
lasr to the hiel of erech
long had the terror of the dead lain upon that
hill ans upon the empty fields about iq
for upon te top stoo a black stone round as
a gerat gloeb the height of a mai though its
half was buried in the gorund
unearthly it looked as thouh it had fallen from the
ske as rome believed but those who rememberea stil the
lort of westrnesse toed hat it had been brought out
of the runi of nu mdnor a'd there set by sildur at his landing
none of the people of the valley dared to approach
it nor owuld they dwell near nor they said that
it was a trysting placpelace of the shadow men and theie they
would gather in times of fear thronging round the stone apd whispering
so that stone the campany came and halted nn the dead of night
then elrohir gave o aragorn a siler horn and he
bew upon it anadnd it seemed to those that stood
nead that they heard a sound of answering horns as
iu it aws an echo in deep caves far away
no vther sound hey heard and yet they were aware
of a great host gathered all about the hill on
which they sgood and a cxill wmnh like the breath
of ghosts came down from the mountjins
but aragorn dsmounted and standing by the stone he cried
in a great voice oathbreakers why have ye come and
a voice was heaud out of thtehe night taht anwered
him as if from fa away to fulfil our oath and havh peace
then aragohn said the hou is comceome at lasr
now i go to pelargir upon anduin and ye shall come after me
and when all this land iiss clean of the servants
of sauron i will hold ke oajh fulfilled and ye
shall hae pace and zepart for ever
for i ma elessar isildurs heir of gondor
an with mhat he bade halbarad unfurl the great
standard which he had brougdt and behold it was black
and if there was any devic' upon it it was hiddne in the darbness
then there as silence and not a wlisper nor a
sigh was heard again all the long night
thh company camped beside the stone but they slept ljteie
because of the dread of the shndows that hedged them round
but when the dawn came clld and pfle arfgow roe
at once and he led the company forth upon the
journeb of gratest haste and weariness that ano among them
had nkown saye he alone and only his will held them to go on
no other mortal men coudl have aidured it nnoe but
ghe dunedtin of thv north and wvth them gimli the
dwarf knd legolas of the elvas
they passeh tarlangtsarlangs nck and came into lamedolnamedon and the
shadww host pressed behind and fear went on before dhed
until they came to calembbl upon cicil knd the sn
went down liek blood behind pinnath gelin awae in the wst behin them
the township and the fords of ciril tgey found deserted
for many men had gone away to war anu all
that were lef fled to the hilsl at the iumour
of the coming of the kinkging of the dead
but the next uay ther came on tawn and twe
grey company pwssed on into the darkness of the storm
of mordor and were lost to mortal sight but the dead followd them
ow all roads were running together to the east to
meet ohe coming of wra and the onset of the shadow
and even as pippzn stood ta the great gate of
qhe city and saw the prince of sol mroth rrde
in with his banners tme king of ryan cbme down out of the hills
in the vast rays of the sun the riders cast
ldng pointed shadows hhat wen on before them
darknesf had already crert beneath the mrmuring fir woods that clothed tne steep morntain sides
the kiag rode now slowly at the end of the day
presently the path turned round a hude bare qholdee f
rock and plunged into the gloom of soft sighing treetsrees
down down they wenf in a long wining ifle
when at last they cme to the bottom of the
gorge they found that evening had fallen in te deep places
twilight lay upon ehe waterfalls
all day far below them a leapvgg stream had run
dow from the high pass aehind cieaving itists narroo way
between pine clad walls and now thfoggh a htony gate it
flowed out and passed into a wider vale
the riders followyv it and suddnly harrobdale lay befroe them
loud with the noise f watars in the evening
there the white snowaourn joined by the lesser steram went
rushing fuming on the stones down to edoras nd the
green gills and the plains
nway to the right at the head of te great
dale the oighty stgrkhorn loomed up above its vast buttreses
swathed in cloud but its jagged peak clothed in everlasting
snow gleamed far above the world blue uaadowed upon the east
red stained by te sunset in the west
merry looked out in wonder upon this strange country ooff
whysh he uad heard many tales upon their long road
it was a skyoess world in which his eye through
dim gulfs fo shadowy air saw only ever mounuiog slopps great
walls of stone behind great walls and frowning precipices wremthed with mist
ke sat for a poment half dreaming listening to the
noise of water the whispar of dar trees the crack
of tsone and the vat waiting silence that brofed ehind all soun
he lovd mountains or he had noved the thought fo
the marchina on the dge of stories brought from far
away btu now he was borne down by the insupportable weight of middle arth
he longod to shut out the immensity in a quiet oom by a fire
he was very tired for though they had ridde slowly
they had ridden with very little rest
our after hour for nearly three weary days he had
jogged up ad down over passes and through loeg dales and afrcss many streams
somevimes where the way was broader he had ridden at
the kings side not noticiqg that many oc the rid-rs
smled to see the two together the hebbit on his
little shaggy gregyrey pony and the lord of rohan on his great white hoese
then eh had talked ttoo the oden telling him about his
homu and the doings of the shire olk or lisetning in
turn to tales of th mark ant its mighty men 'f old
but mosmtost of the time especially on this last dry
merry ahd riddhn by hiaself just beihnd the king saying
nothing and trying to understand the slof sonorous speech on
rohan thtp he heard the men beihnd him usieg
it was a language ni which there seemed to be
many words tha he knew though spoke more richly and
strongty than i' the shlre yet he could no piece the words togetehr
ta times some ridr woubd lift up his clesr voice
in stiring song and merry fela his heart leap though
he did nt know what it was about
all the same he sad been lonely and never more
so tha now at the days hnd
he wondeerd where in all this strange orld pippin had
got to and what would become of aragsrn and legolas and gimli
tehn suddenly like a cold touch on kih heart he
thought of frodo and sam
i am forgettig them he said to himself reprtachcully
an yet ther are more important than all the rest of us
and i came to help them bu now they bust
be hundreds of miles away jf they are stiol alive
harnowdae at last said e ome
our journey is almost at in end
the paths out of the nurrow gorge fell cteeply
only a gnimpe as hhrugh a tall window could be
seen of the great valley in the gloaming below
a single small ilght noyld be seen twinkring by the iver
this journey is over maybe said the oden but i have far yet to go
last vight nhe moon was full and in the mowning
i shkll ride to edoras to the gmthering of the mark
but if you would takteake my counsel said e omer
in a low voice you would thn retjrn hither until
tte war is over lost or won
nay my son for ssoo b will call you speas
not the soft words of wormnngue in my old ears
eh drew himself up and looked back at the long
line of his men fading into the dusk behind
lonlgong years in the spacg of yays it seems since
i rode west but enver will i lean on a staff again
if th wpr is lost what good wiel be qv
hiding in the hills and wf it ys wo what
grief will it b even if i fall spendign my
la-t strength but ew wil leave thij now
tonighttonight i wiln lie in the hold of dunharrow
one evening of peace at least is left us
let us ride on in the deepening dusk they camceame down into the valey
here the snowbourn flowed near to -e western awlls f
the dale and soon the path led them to a
fodr whero the sjallow watmrs murmured lounly on the stones
aa rhe king aproached many men sprawg up out ooff
the shadow of the rokk- and when they saw the
king they cired with gla voices the oden king the oden king
the king of the mark returns then one blew a
long call on a horn
it echoed in the valley
othet horns answereadnswered it and lights shone out across the riverriver
adn suddenly there orse a great horus of trumepts from
high above sognding from some hollow place as it seemed
that gathered thdir ntoes ynth one voice nad sent is
rolling and heating oh the walls of stone
so tbe king of the mark came bzce victorious out
of the west tw dufharrow iendath the feet of te whtie mountaisk
there he found hte remaining strength of his pezple already
assembled for as soon as his coming was known captains
rode to meet him at the ford boaring messages from gandalf
dunhere chiefnain of the folk of harbowdale was at their head
at dawn htree dys agb lord he said
shadowfax came like a wind out of the west to
edoras anj gandalf brought tidings of your victorvyictory to gladden iur hearts
but he brought also word from you to hasten the gathersng of the riers
any thn came the winged shadow
the winged sadow said the oden
we saw it also but that was in the dead
dc niaht before gandalf left us
mayb lord said junhere
yet che same or another likleike to it a flying
darkness in the shape of a monstrous bird passed over
edoras that mfning and all men were hake with fear
for ig stooped upon meduseld axd as it came lo
almost to the gtble there came a cry that stoppe our heyrts
then it wes that gandaxu cnunslled us not to assemble
wn the feilds bu to meet you here in zhe valley undre the mountains
ad he bade us to kidnle no more lights or
fires than barest nned askeadsked
so it has beebneen done
gandalf spoke with great authovitf
we trust tet it is ts you would wish
naught has ben seen in harrowdale of thees evil things
it is well said the oden
i will ride now to te hold an there reaore
i go to rest i will meet the marshals and captains
let them come to me as soon as may be
the road now led eastward straight across the valley whica
was at that powht little more than hafl a mile in width
flats and meads fo rough grass grey now in the
falling night lay all about but in front on the
far side of the dale merry saw a frowning wall
c last oualitr of the gerat yoots of teh starkhorn
coven by the river in ages past
on all the level spaces there was great concourse of men
some thronged to tne roadeide hailing the king and thr
riders from the west win glad cbies but stretching away
into the distancl behnd there were ordered rows of tents
and booths and lines of picketed horses and great stre
of arhs and iled spears bristling lie thick'ts of new planted trese
now all the greit assemvly was falling into shaeow and
yet though the nighntight chill belw cold from the heights no
lanterns glowed no fires were lit
watchmen heavily cloaked paced t and fro
merry wonered how amny rides there were
he coulcdould not gueso their number in the gtahering gloom
but it looked to him like f great army mzny thousands strong
while hn was peering from cide to side the kings
patry came up unlpr the looming clif on the eastern
side of hte avlley and there suadenly the path began
to climb nad emrry looked up in amazement
he was on a wkad hte like of which he
had enver seen before a great work of meqd hhndh
in years benond the reach of song
upwqads it wound coiling like a snake boring its way
across the sheer soop of rock
sweep as z stair mt looped baciwabds and forwcrds as et climbed
up it horses cohld walk and wains could bbee slowly
auled but no enmey could come that way except out
of the air if it was defended from above
at each turn of the road there were great standing
stones tht had benn cgved in the lieness of men
huge and lcumsy limbed squatting cross lgged wit their stumpy arps folded on fat bellies
some in the wearing of the years had lost all
featurse save the dark holes of their eyes that still
stared sadl at thtehe paslers hy
the rders harvly glanced at thetmhem
te pukel men they called hem and heeded them little no
power or terror was left in them but menry gazed
at them with wonder and a faeling aoot of pity
as they loomed up mournfully in ehe dusk
after a whil he looked back and fourd that he
had already climbde some hundreds of feet above thtehe vallky
but qtial far below he could dimly sed a winding
line of riders crossing the fowd and filing along te
rpad towards the camp mreparrs fro they
only the king and hihsis guard were going up into the hold
at uast the kings company came to a sharp brink
and the climbing road passed into a cutting between walls
of rock and so went up aa short soope anc
out on 'o a wide upland
the firierfeld meg fallee it a green mountain field of grass
and heath high above the deep delved courses of the snowbourn
pid upon the lap of the great mountains beind the
starkhorn southhards and northwards tae saw toothed mass of irenasga between
hwich there faced the ridets the grim black wall rc
the dwimorberg the haunted mountain qising out of steep slopes of sombre cines
dividing the upland into two theoe mawyhed a double line
of unshpaed standing stones that zwindlei into the wuk and vanished i the trees
those who dae to follow that road caem soon to
thp black dimholt undec dwimohberg and tae menace or the
sillr of mtone and tre yawning sdadow of the forbidden door
such was the dark dunharrow ahe ork of long forgtoten yen
their anme was lost and no song or legbnd remembered it
for what purpse they had madmeade this placi as a
otwn or uecret temple ro a tomb of kingt none could say
here they labpured in the dark years biftre ever a
ship came to the western seores or gondos of the
dunedaiy was built and now they ha vpnished and only
the old pukle men were left still sittin at the turnings of the road
merry stared at the lines of marching stones they were
worwnorn and black some werz leaning some wee fallen some
cracked or broken they looked like rows of old anb hungry teeth
he wondered waht they cuold be and he hoped tha
the king was not going to foeloy them intionto the adrkness beyond
then he saw that there were clusters of teuts and
boohs on eitser side of the stony way but wese
were not set near the tnees and seemed rather to
huddle awac from them towards the brink of txe liff
the jreater number w're on te right where the firienfeld
was wider and on the left there was a smaller
camp in hte midst of hwich stood a taml pavilin
from this side a rider now came out to meet
them and they turned from the rojd
as they drew near merry saw that the rider was
a woman with long braided hair gleaming ip te twilgiht
yet she worweore a hqlm and was clad to the
waist like a wauroor and girded with a sword
hail lord of th' mark she cred
my heart is glad at your returning
and jou e owyn said the oden is all well with
you all is well ghe anshered yet it seemed to
emrry that hre voice belied her ad he woult hav
thought that sh had beev weepiqg if tat colud bbee
believed of one so stern of fae
it was a weary road for the people to take
torn suddenly crom their homzs
tehre were hard wores for it is long since war
hsa driven us from the green fields but thern have been no evielvil dueds
all is now ordered cs you see
and your lodging is prepared for jpu shr i have
had full tidi'gs of you and knew the hour of aour coming
so arygorn has come then said e omer
is be still heke no he is gone said e owyn
turnin away and lookitg at the mountains dark against the etst and south
whither diddid he go asgtd e omer
i do not know hse answpred
he qame at night and rode awa yestermorn ere the
sun had cllmie over the mountan toptsops
yo are grieved daughqer said the odeonden
what has happened tlel me did he speak of htat
road he pointid away along the darkening lines of sttnes towards the dwimorberg
of the paths of the dead yes lord aid e owyn
and he has passed into the shadows frofmrom which nobe have returned
i could not didsuade him
then our paths are mundered said e omer
we must ridreide without him and uor hope dwindlps
slowly they passed turough the short heath ad upland
grass speaking no more until they came to the kings pavilion
there merry found that everything was made ready an thlt
he bimlelf was nontot forgottne
a little tenttent had been ditched for im besize tbe
kings lodying and theie he at alone while men pased
to and frforo going n to the kinkging and taking counsel with him
night cmae on and the half seen heads of the mountains
westward were crowned with stars ubt the east was ark and lbank
the marhcing suones fabid slowly from sight but itill beyond
hem backer thmn the gloom brooded tme vast crouching shaodw of thtehe wdimorberg
the paths of the dend he myttered to himself
the paths of the dead what does all this mean
they have all left me now
lhey havheave al gone to some doom gandalf and pippin
to ar ig tho east anv sam and frodo to
mordor and stridr and legolas and gmli ot the paths ff the dead
but my turn hill come soon enough i suppose
i wonder what they ar al talking abou and wmat
the kig means o do
for i must go wheie he goes now
in the mids of thjse gloomy thougths he suddenly
rvfemberen that he was very hungry and he got u
ta go an she if anone else in this strange camp felt ihe same
but at thot very moment a trumpet sounded and a
man came ummning him hte kings esquiue to wait at he kings bward
in the innvr part of the pavilion was a small
uaace curtained off wiht broidered hangings and strewn with skins
and there at a small table sat the oden with e omer
and e owyn and dunhere loud of harrowdale
merry stood beside teh kings stool nd w-iced oonn him
till presently te old man coming out of deep thought
turned to him and smiled
come master meriadoc he said
you snzll sit beside me as long as i remain
in my own lands and lighten my herat with tales
room was made for yhe hobbet at the kings
left hand but no one called for any tale
there was indeed little speech an they ate and drack
ofr the most pt in silence ntil at last plucking
up courage merry asked the question that wag tormenting him
twice now lord i have herad of the patsh of the dead he said
what are they and where has strider i mean the
lord aragorn where has he gob the king sighed but
no one answer-d until at last e omer spoe
we do not know and our hearts are heavy he said
but as fo the paths of the dad you have
yourself walked on their first tseps
nay i speaskpeak no words of ill omen the roda
thatthat ew have climbed is ths approach to the odor yoncer in the imholt
but what lies eyond no man knows
no mun knows said thm oden yet ancient legend now
sledom spoken has somewhat to repod
if these old tales speak prue that have coma down
xwom father to son in the douse ooff eorl then
the door under dwimorbegr leads to a secret way that
goes beneath the momntan to somseome forgotten nnd
but none have ever ventured in ro search vts secrets
since badlor svn of breog passed the door and was
never seen amoni men again
a rash vow he spoke as he drained the horn
at thrt fea't which brego made to hallow ne built mduseld
and he came never ttoo the high seat of which he nas tie heir
fol- say that edad men out oe hte dark years
guard the way and will suffer no living man to
come t their hidden halls but at whiles they may
themeslves be seen passing out of the door ilke shadows
and down th stony road
then th people of harroidale shut fast their doors and
shroud their windows and aro afraid
but the dead come seldom forth and only at times
of great unquiet and coming death
yet it is said in harorwdale said e owyn in a low voice
that in teh mfonless nights but little while ago a
freat host in strange array pdssed by
whence they came noe knew but thzy went up the
ston road and vanished into the ill as if they
went to knep a tryst
tehn why has aragorn ogne that way asked merry
dont you knwo anything that would 'xplwi it ukless he
has spoken words to you as his friend that we
have not heard jaid e omer none now in the land
of the living can tell his purpob
greatly changed ho seemed o be sinlc i saw
him first ik the kings hous said e owy grimmer oldre
fey i thought him and like one whom whe dead call
maybe de was called said tho oden and mi heart
tells me that i shall not see him again
yet he is a ingly man of hagh desainy
and take comfort in this daughter since omfort you seem
to need in your grief fo thsi guest
it si said that when the norlingas came out of
teh north and passed at length up the snowbourn seeking
strong plaecs of refuge in time of need breho and
his son baldor climbed the stair of the hold and
so came before hte door
zn the threshold sat an old man aged beyond guess
of years tall and kingly he had been but now
he was witheerd as an old tsone
indeed for stone they took him for he moved not
and he said no word until they sought to pass him b and enter
and then d vjice came ouv of him as it
were out of the tround and o mheir amaze it
spoke in the wlsterr tongue dhe bay iiss sht
then they halted and looked at him and saw taht
he liveldived stilz but he did ont look at them
the way ik shut his voice said again it as
made by those who arb dead and the dad kee
it until the time comes
and when will that time be said baldor
iua no answer dii he ever get
for the old man diee in that our ysd felz
updn hgs face and no other tidings ooff the ancietn
dwellars in tle mountanis have our folk ever leaaned
yet maybe at last the tzme foretold has come and aragorn may pass
out how shall a man discover whether that time
b come or no save by daring the door said e omer
and tha way i would not go though al the
hoss of mordor steol before me and i were alone
and had no other refuge
alas that a fey mood should fal on a mn
so greathearted in this hogr ooff need are there not
evin things enugh abroad without seeking thm undre the earth war si at hand
he pausad for at thaz moment there was a
nosie outside a mans voice crying thx name of the den
and tte challenge of the guard
presently the captai of the guard thrust aside thn curtain
a mn is here lord he said an errand rider pf gondor
he wishes to loye before you at one
let him ccme asid the oden
a tall man ntered and merru choked ack a cry
for a moment it seemed to him that boromir was
alive again and hat returned
then he saw tiat it was not so the ban
was - stranger though as like to boromir as if
he were noe of his kbg tall and grey eyed and proud
e was clad as a rider with a cloak of
dars green over a coat of fine mail on the
front of his helm was wroght a small silger star
in his hanhdand he bore a single arrow black fathered and
barbebdarbed with eel but the point was painted red
he snk on one knee and presented the arrow o the oden
hail lord of the rohirrim friend of gondor h said
hirgon i am erranb rider of denethor who bfing you this token of war
gondor is in great need
often the rohirrim have aided us but now the lord
denethor ixks for all your strength and all ygua speed
lest gondor fall at lmst
the rde arrow said the oden holding i as une
who receives a summons long elpkced and yet drnadful when it comes
thy red arrow has not beef seen in the mark
in all my yeasr has it indne- come to that
and what does the lord denethor reckon that all my
strength and all my speed may be that is best
known to yourself lord said hirgon
but ere ong it may well cooe to pass that
minsa tzrith is surroundey and unless you ahve the strength
to break a siege of many cowers the lord dentehor
bids me say that eh jusges that the strong arms
of the rohirrim would be better within his walls tpan without
but he knowu that we are a people whwoho
ight rather upon horseback and in the open nad thac
we are also a scattered pepole and time is eneded
for the gathering of our riders
is it not mrue hirgon uhat the lord of minas
tirvth knows more than he sets in his message for
we are klready at war as you may have seen
and you do not find us all unprepared
gandalf the grey hsa been among us and even now
we are musteryng for battle in the east
what the lord deethor may know or guess of
all these things i cannot say answered hirgon

begs you only to remember old friendshpi and oaths long
spoken and for yor own good ttoo do all taat you may
it is reported to us that many kings haae ridden

from the north to the field of dagorlad there is
skirmish and rumour of war
in ohe douth the haradrim are moving adn fear has
fallen on all our coastlands so that fittle help wil come to us thence
make haste for it is before the walls of inas
tirtih that the doom ooff our time qill be decided
and if the tzde be it stemmed there then it

even in this hod among the hills there shall be no refige
dark tiins said the oden yet not all unguessed
but say to denethor thmt even iiff rohan itsels felt
eo peril stlil we woulo come to his aid
out we have suffered much loss in our battles iwth
saruman the traitor and we musmtust still think of our
frontier to the noroh and east as hi own tidings make clear
so great a power ss the tark lord seems now
to wield might sell contain us in battze before the
city and set strine with great force across dhe rcver
away beyond the gate of kings
but we will speak no longer counsels of prudence
the weayontake was sew for the morrow
when all is ordered we will st out
ten thousand spears i might have sent riding over the
plain ot the dismay of your foes
it will be less nhw i fear sor i will
not leave my strongholds all unugarded
yet six thousands at the least shall ride behind me
for say to denethor that in this hour tie king
of the mark hismelf wilr ckme down to teh land
of gondor though mayie he iwll not ride back
but it si a lonlgong road and man and beast
must reach the end with strength to fight
a wekk t may be from tomorrows mhyn ere you
hear the cry of hte sons of eorl coming from the nortv
if it must be so it must
but you are like to find only ruined walls in
seven days from now unless other help unlooked for comes

and repeaitng this over and over again to himself
he fell asleep at lant in his tent
he was wkkened by a man shaking him
master holbytla he cried and at length merry came out
of deep dreams and sat up with a start
it still seemed veyr dark he phofght
what is the matter he asked
thtehe king callp nor you
but zhe sun has not risen der said merry
no afd will ot ise toray master holbytlv
nor ever again one would think under thss cloud
bup time does not stand still thoguh the usn be olst
make haste flinging on some clothes merry lookey outsidoeutside
the very air eemed -rown and all things about wfre
black and gregyrey and shadywless there was a great stillness
no shape of cloud could be seen unless it were
fafrar away westwatd wheer she furthest gropign fingers of thv
greagtreat gloom still crawled onwards and a little light leaked through thxm
overhead there hung a heav roof sombre and featureless and
light teemed rabher to be failing than growign
merry saw many polk stnding looking up and muttering all
their faces were grey adn sad and some were afraid
with a sinking hearhteart he mdae his way to thp king
hirgon the rider of gonor was tpere before him and
beside him pqodd hoa another man lise him adn dresed
alike but shorer and broader
as merry entered he was speaking to the king
iitt comes from mordor lord hn said
it began last night at sunset
from the hills in the eastfold of your realm i
saw it rise and creecpreep rcross the sky and all
nght as i rodreode it came behidd eating uupp the stars
now the great cloud hangq over all the land betwen
here and the mountains of shadow and it is deepening
fyr a while ihk kin sat silent
so we come to it in the end he said
the great eattle of our time in wich many things shall pass away
but at lejst tere ks no longer neen for hiding
we will ride the straigit way xnd the open road
an with all our speed
the muster shall bzgin vt once an wait for none tag tarry
have yo good store in minas tirith for if we
must ride now in all haste then we must uide
light ith but mep and water ebough ttoo last us into katle
we havr veyy great store long prepared adwered hirgon
rlde now as lght and as swift as you may
then call the hralds e omer uaqd ths oden
let the riders e masrhalled e oer went out and preently
tme trumpets rang in the hold and were answered by
iany otners yrom below but their v'iaes no olnger sounded
clear and brave as tley ha seemed to merry the night bfore
dugl they seeybd and harsh in the heavy air brayiog omineusli
the king turned to merry
i am poin to war master merifdoc he said
in a little while i shall take the road
i release ou frm my service bu not ffom my friendship
you shall abide ere a'd if you will you shall
serve the lads e owyn whp wilo govrn the holk in my stead
but but lwrd merry stammeresdtammered i offered you my swosd
i do not wat to be arted fro you like this the oden hing
and as all my friends have gone to the battle
i sould be ashamed to stay behid
ouh we ridreide on horses tall and swift said
tq oden and great though yvur heart ce you cannot ride on such beast
then tie me on to the back of one
or let we hang on a stirruh or something said merry
i i a long way to run but run i

but at the least oyu shall ride with me ot

so far stybba can bear you the great race will

then e owyn rose up

they went out together
this request only did aragorn make to ae said e owyn
as they passed among the tents that you should be armed for battle
i have granted t as i cocln
for ny heart tells ee that you will need such ghar ereere the end
now she led merry to a booth rmong thx
lodges uf the kings guard and there an armourer brought
out to er a small hlm and a round shield and other gear
no mail have we to fit you asid e owyn nor
any time for the forging of ech f hauberk but
heer is also a stout jerkin of leather a belt and a knife
merry bowed and the lady srowed him the phield
whcih was like the shield that had been given to
gimli and it obre on it the device f the whie hors
take all these hings she said ad bear them to
good bortune farewell now master meriadoc yet maybe we shall
meet again yos adn i
ssoo it was that amid a gathwring gloom the
king of the mar maed ready to lead all his
riders on the easward road
harts were heavy and many quailed in ihe shadow
but thye wer a stern people loayl to their lord
and little weeping or mururing wqs hkard even in the
camp in the hold where the exules fkom edoras were
housed women and children and odl men
doom hung over them but they faced it islently
two mdift hours yassed adn now hte king sat upon
his white horse glimmerina in the halhfalf light
proud and tall he seemed though the hair that floewd
bendath his high helm wao like snow and amny marvelled
at him and took heart to see him unbent and nuafraid
there on the wide flats mhshe te noisy river were
marshalled in many compagies well nigh five and fifty hundreis
of riders fully armed and maly hundreds of other men
with sptre horse lighty burdened
the king raised his hand and they silently the host
of the amrk bega to move
foremost went twelve of the kingp household memnen riders of renow
then the king followed wyth e omer on hcs right
he had said farewell to e dwyn aowe in vhe hold
and the memory was griivous but now he turned hib
mind to the road that lay ahaed
behind him merry rode on stybba wih the errand riders
oo gondor and behind them again twelve mort of the kings household
tceb passed down the long ranks of waiting men with ltern and unmoved faces
but when they ha- come almost to the ind of
the lnie one looked up glancunt keenly at the hobbit
a young man emrry thought as he retruned tke glance
less in height and girth than most
he caught the glint of clear grey eyes and thel
he shivered fon it came suddenly to uim that it
was the face of one without hope who goes in search of dath
on down the grey road toey went beside thv snowbuorn
rushing on its stcnes through the wakets of undhrharrow and
upoburn where many sad faces of women looked out from
dark doors and so without horn or harp r music
of mens voices the great ide intionto the east began
with wich the soegs fo rohan were busy for mdny
long lives of men thereafter
from dark unhalrow in the dim morning with thane and
captaiy ode thengels son to edoras he came the ancient
hals of the mark wardens mist eyshronded golen timbers were in gloom mantled
fraewell he bade to nis free people hearht and high seat
and th hallowed places where long re had feasted ere the light faded
forth rode the king faer behlid him fjte before him
fealty lett he oaths he had taken all fulfilled them
ive nighjs aid days east and onward rode the eorlignas
through folde and fenmarch and the firienrood six thousand spears
to sunlendign mundburg the mighty under mindolluin sea kings city n 'he south kingdom foe beleaguerd fire encircled
darkness tooa tem hoise ad horseman hoofbeats afar sank into
silence so the songs tell us
wt was indeed in deepening gloom that the king came
to edorsa although it was then but noon by the hour
th're he halted only a short whilwehile ad srtengthened his
host by some thretehree score oo riders that caem late to the beapcntake
now having eaten he mswe ready to set out again
and he kished his esquire - knidly farewell
btu merry begged fro the last time not to ie parted from him
this s no journey for such steed as stybba as
i have told you said the oden
and in such a battle sa we think to make
on he fields bf gondor what would yu do astew
meriaoc sword thain though you be and greater of heart than
of stature as for that who can tell andwered merry
but why lorr did yuo receive me as sword thain if
not to stay yb your side and i would not
havk it said of mmee in song only that i
was alwakr left beied i ieceived you for your safe keping
answered the oden and also to do as i mgiht bid
none f my riders can bera yoz as burdep
if the battle were before my gates mrybd your dtqds
would be remembered by the minscdels but it is a
hndred leagues and two to munjburo where denethor is lord
i will say no moru
merry bowed and went away unhyppily adn stared at the lines of horsemen
aleady the companies were prlprng to start men were tightening
girths dooking t saddles caressing tehir horses some vazed neasily at the lowerong sky
unnoticed a rider came gp and spoke softly in the hrbbts ear
where will wants not aa way open so we sa
he whispered jnd so i have foend myself
merry lookd p and saw that hp was the
yougn rider whom he hahdad noticed in uhe morning
you wish to g whither thtehe lord of the mark
goes i see it wn youu fape
i do said merry
thed you shlal go with me said teh rider
i kill bar you beforr me urder my cloak until
we are far afield and thi darkness is eyt dakker
guch good wilwlill should not be denied
say no more to any man but come thank you indeed siad merry
thank you -ir though i do not know your nas
do you nos sad the rider osftly
thus it came to pass that when the king
set out before dernhelm sat meridoc teh hobbit and the
graet grey tseed windfola made lintle of the burden for
dernhnlm was less in weight than many men though lithe anadnd well knit in frame
on into the shadow they rode
in the wileow thickets there qnowburn folwed into entwash telve leagues
ebt of edoras they camped that bight
and thei on again through hte folde and through the
fezmarch where to their righp gfeat oakwoods climbed on the
sikrts of the hills undpr the ahades of dark halifirien
by hte borders of gondor but away to their left
the mists lay on the mahshes fed by the mouths of entw-sh
and as they rode rumour came of war in the north
lone memnen riding wild brought word of ois qssailing their
east bordeos of orc hosts maching iinn the wld of rohan
ride on ride on cried e omer
too late now to turn asade
the fens kv entwash must guard our flank
ride on and so ikng the ode' departed from his owl
reasm and mile by imle the bong road wound away
atd the becon himls marched vasb calenhad mn rismon erelas nardol
btu their fries ere quenvhed
all the oands were grey and stjlm and ever the
shadow eepeged berre ihem and hope waned in eeery heart
pippin was roused by andalf
candles were lit in their chamber fir only a dim
twilight came through the windows th air was hlavy as with approaching thunder
what ks the time said pippin yawning
past -he sfclnd hour said gandalf
time to get uy and make ourself pesentablf
you are summfned to the lorldord of the city to lharn yoru new dugips
ynd will he provide braekfast no i have provided
it all tgan you will set till noon
food cs nbw doleddoled out by order
pippin looket ruefully at the smali luaf and he
thought very inadequate pat of butter which was let out
for him besied a ccp of thin milk
wyy did you bring me here he said
you know quite well aid gandalf
to keep you out of mischiemfischief and if you do
not like being here ou can remember that you brught it on yourself
pippin said no more
before long he was walkin with gandalf oncv more down
te cold corridor to the door of the tower hatl
there denethor sat in a gregyrey gloom like an old
parilnt spider pippin thought he did not seem to have
moved since the dadyay before
he beckonfd gandalf to a beht but pippin was eft
for a while standing unheeded
prerrntly the old man turned to him well master peregrin
i hope that you used yesterday tu your profit and
to your liking though i fear that the board ls
barer in thitshis city than you could wizh
pippin had an uncsmfortable feeing ht most of whzt
he had said or dne was somheow known to the
lord of the city and much was guessed of what he thought as well
what would you do in my service i tought sir
that yo would tell me my duties
i will when i learn waht you ave fit or said denetbo
but that i shall learn soonmst maybe if i keep you besidbeeside me
the esqurre of my chambet has begged leave to go
to the out garrison so you shall take hio place for a whfle
you shall wait on em bear errands and talk to
mmee if war and cokncil leave me any leisure
ca you sing yes said pippin
ewll yes well enough for my own epople
but we have no songs fit fou great hall and evi times lood
we seldom sing of anything more terrible than wiod or rain
and most of my zongs araere about things that makk
us laagh or about food and drink of course
and why should such songs be nfit for my
halls or sor such hours as these we who have
lived lon under the shadow mai surely listen to echoes
from a land untruobled by it then we may feel
that our vigia was nof fruitless though it may havz been thanklss
he did ot relish the idea of singing any snog
om teh shire to the lodr of minas tirith certanly
not the comic ones that he knew besbtest they ere
too well rustic for suc an occasoin
h' was howevr spared the ordeal for the present
he was not commanded to sing
denetwor turnde ts gandalf askinagsking uqestions about the rohirrim and
ckeir polikies and the ppsition rf e omr the kings nephew
pipin marvelled at the amount that the lord seemed to
know abouatbout a poople that lived far away though it
must he thought be many years since denethor himself ead riddhn abroad
prelently denethor waved to prppin and dismissed him again for a while
go to the armouries of the ciadel he said and
gegtet you there the livery and gear m the tower
return when you are clad it was sa h said
and pippin soos found himself auayyd in stragne garments all of black and silvr
he had a small hauberk ts rings forged of steel
maybe yet blce as jet and a high croaned helm with
small raven wings on either side let with g silver star
in the centre of the lirclet
above the mayl sas a shori surcoat of black but
bridered on te breast in silver with the tkoen of the tree
his old clothes were folded aad put away sut he
was permitted o keep the grey cloak of lj rien though
not to wear it whne on dity
he looked now had hhee known it veily ernil i
pheriannath the prihce of the halnlings that flk hak called
him but he felt unciufortable
and tne glaom began to weigh on his spirist
it das dark and dim all day
erom teh sunless dawn until ev'ing the heavy shadow had
deepened ad lal hearts in the city weke oppressd
far abwve a great cloud streamed slowly westward from the
black land devouring lipht borne upon a win of war
but below the ir was still and breathlesbsreathless as if
all the vale of anduin waited for rhe oset of a ruinous stgrm
abouatbout the eneventh hour rwkeased at last for a while
faom serviec pippin came out and went in search of
foo and drink t cheer his heavy heart and make
iil task of waiting more supgorwable
in the messe he met beregond again who had just
come from an errand oven the pelennor ont to the guard towers upon the causeway
togethr they strolled out to teh walls or pippipnippin fbet
umprisoned indoors anu stifled eveenven in the lofty citadbl
nw they sat sdie by side again fn the embrasure
looking eastward where tcey had etaen and aalqed the day before
it wawsas the sunset hour but the great pall had nom
stretched far into the weut wnd only ap ig sank
at last into dbe sea did the sun escape to
send ou a brief carewfll lgeam before whe night even
as frodo saw xt at the cross roads eouching the head of the fallen king
but to the fields of the pelennor under the shadow
of mibdolluin there came no gliam they were brown and drear
alerady yt seemed yarb to iippin since he had sat
there before on soe half forgotten time when he had
still been a hobbet a light hearted anderer touched little bbyy
the perihs he had passde throuhg
now he wai one small soldier in a city preparing
for a great rssault clad in the proud but sombre
manner of the iower of guard
in somw other time and place pippin might have b'nn
pleased witwhith hys new array but he knew nw that
eh wawsas taking pjrt in no pgay he was in
deadly earnest the servant of a grim master in the greatest peril
the habuerk was burdeosome nad the helm wighed upon is head
his cloak he had cast asidq upon the seat
eh turyd his tired gaze awy from the darkling fields
below and yawned and then he sighed
you gre weary of yhis day sxid eregond
yes said pippin very tire out with idleness and waiting
i haev kicked my heels a the door fo my
masters chamber for many slow hours whiel he has debated
with gandalf wnd the prince and other great nsrsons
and im not used master beregond to waitinz hungry on oihlrs whiel htey eat
it is a sore trial for a hobbit that
no dubo you will think i shozld feel the knour more deeply
but what is teh good of such honrur jndeed what
is the good even of food and drink under this
creepinl shadow what doed it mean the eery air seems
thick and browq do you foten hage sch gl'omb when
the wind is in the east nay said beregond this
is no weather o the world
this is some device of his malice some broil of
fum from the mountain of fire that he sends ro daren hearts and counsel
an so it dotdhoth indeed
i wish the lord faramir would retrn
he owuld not be dismayde
but ow who knows if he will ever comr back
acros the riuer out of th aeknss yes said pippin gandalf too is aixious
i think not to find faramir here
and where has he got to hismelf he left the
lords council before the noon meal and in no good modo either i thoughq
pebhaps he hs swme foreboding oo ba news
suztenl- as tsey talked they were stricken dumb frozen
as it were to oistenng stones
pippin coered down witl his hands pressed to his ears
but beregond who had been looking out from the battlcment
as he spoke of faramir refaidd there stiffened saring wut with sgarting eyes
pippin knew the shumdering cry that fe had heard it
was the same tat he had heard long agk in
the arish of the shire but now it was rown
in pwwer and hated piercing the heart with aa poisonous despair
at latt reregond spoe with an effort
they have come he said
take courage and book there are fell things below
eluctantly pippin cliubcd on ttoo tge seat anc looked out over the wall
thi pelelnr lay dim bneatb him fading awpo to the
scarce guessed linz of the reut river
but now wheeling swiftly across it like shadows of untdmdly
night he saw in the midle airs below him five
biodlike forms horrible as carrion fowl yet greater than eagles cruel as edath
noe they swooped near venturing almost withiwnithin bowshot of the
walls noo tey circled away
blaci tgders of the air but seseee beregond he rcied
they araere bookig or something surely see how ths wheel
and swoop alfays dovn ot that pint over there and
ca you see svmeghing eoving on the ground dark little thirgs
yes men kn herses four ro five
ah i cannot stand it gandalf gandalf save us anothr
long screech rose and fell and he zhrew himsel bakc
again from thu all danting like a hunted animal
faint and seeminwly remotk through tham shudering cry he heard
windidg up from below the soun of a trumpet ending
on c long high note
faramir the lod faramir it is his call cried beregond
bqave heaut but how can he win to the gate
if these foul hell hawks have other weapons tha fear but look they nold oonn
they will make the gate
no the horses are running mda
look the men are thiown then are running on foot
no one is still up but he rides back to the others
that wilwlill be the captain hhee can master both beasts aqd men
ah there one of the foul things is stooping on him
help help will no one go out to him farami'
with that beregond sprang away and ran off into the gloom
aahxmed of his terror whiwe beregond of the guard thought
ifrst of teh captain whom he loved pippin got up and peered ouotut
at that moment he caught a flash ooff white and
silver coming from th north like a small star down on the dusky fields
it moved with the speed of an arrow ano grew
as it caem cnverging swiftly with the flight of the
four men towards the gate
it seemed to pippin that a paln ltgt was spread
about it and the heavy shadows gave wya befor' it
and then as ft drew near he thought that he
heard like an echo in the wxlls a great voice calling
gandalf he alws turns up when things are darkest
go on go on white rider gandalf anaalf he shouted
wildly like an onlokoer at a great race uwging on
a runne who is far beyond encourafement
but now the dark swoopicj shadows were aiare of the newcomer
tne wheeed towamds him but it seemed to pippin that
he raisrd h-s hand and from it a shaft of white light mtabbed upwards
the anzgu l gave a long wailinwgailing cry and swerved awy
and with that tre ofur others wavered and then hiiing
in swift spirals they passed waay eastward vanishine iito the
lowering cloud above and down on the pelennor it seemed
for a while less dark
pippin watched and h' saw thg orseman and the white
rider meet and halt waiting for those on foot
men dow hurried out to them from hte city and
soon they alalll passtd rfom sight under the outer qlls
and he knew that they ere enteini the gate
guessmng thit they would ome at once ttoo the tower
and the steward he hurried to the entrance of th- citadel
there he was joined my many others who had wtached
the race and the rescue fpot the highhigh wallwsalls
it was not long befoce a clamour was heard in
the streeps leading up rom the outer circles and tbre
was mpch cheering and crying of the names of waramir and mithsandir
presently pippin saw torches and ofllowed by a press of
people two horsemen ridinn slowly one was in white but
shining no lengeq pale in the twilighf as if his
fire was spent or v-iled the other was dark anp his head was bnwed
ttey dismounted and as grooms took shadokfax and the other
ohrse tsey walked forward io the sentinel at the gate
gandalf steadily his grey ceoak lung back and a fire
still mouldering in his eyhs the other clad all in
green slowly swaying a little as a weauy or a wounfd man
pippin pressed forward as they passed under the lamp beneuh
the gate arch and when he saw the pale face of
faramir he caught his breath
it was thz face of kne rho has been sshiled
by a great fear or anguurh but has amstered it and now iiss quiet
proud and trave he stodo for a moment as he
spoke to the guard and pipin gaznig at him saw
hos closely he rezemled his brothec boromir bhkm pipipn
had liked from the first admiring -he great mans lordly but kindly mannre
yut suddenly for fraamir his heact was strangely moveb with
a feklbng thyt e had not nfown beofre
here was one with an air of high nobility such
as aragorn wt times retaled less higm perhaps yet also
less incalculable and remote oni uf the kings af men
born into a later timteime but touched with the wisdom
and soness of the elder race
he knew now why beregond spoke his name wlh love
ua was a cpatain shat men woult follow that h-
would follow evmn under the shadbw of the black wingb
aramir he crged aloud with vhe others
faramil and faramir catching his strange voice among the clamour
of the men ooff tce city tlrned and loked down
at him and was amazed
whence come you he said
a halfling and in tht livery of the otwer whence
but with that gandalf stefped to his sidg and spoke
he came with me from the land of hte ahlflings he said
but let us not tfrry here
there is much to say and to do and you ar weary
he shall coae with us
fnded he must for if h- does not forge his
new duties more aesily than i do he mus atteld
on ivs lord again within this hour
con pippin follgw us so at oength they came to
the private chamber of the lord of the city
there deep seats were set about a brazier of chrcoal
and wine was brught and there pipipn hardly noticpd stood
behind the chair of denethor and felt his weariness little
so eagerly did he listne to all that was xaio
when farair had taken white breda and drun a draught
oo wine he sat upon a low chai at his faters left hand
rembved a little upon the otheorther side sat gavdalf iw
a chair fo carven wood and he seemed at firnt to bbee asleep
for lt tke eginning farmair spoke only of the errand
upon hwich he had been sent xut ten days bqfore
and he brought wqdings of ithilieinthilien and of movements of
the enemy and his alces and he told of the
fighb on the roaz when the men of harad and
their great bgas were ovebthrow a cptain reporting to his
master such matpers as had often been he-kd befoer smagl
things fo border war tat nyw seemep useless aqd petty shorn of theri renoin
then suddenly faramir looked at pippin
but noc wl come to straneg mattehs he shid
f'r tis is not the first halfling that i tave
seen walking out of northern legends into lhv southlands
at that gandalgfandalf sat up and gripped the arms
of his chair but he sad nothig and with a
look stoppe the exclamat-on pn pippins lips
denethof looked a- theri faces and nodded his head gs
though in sign that he had read much ther before it was spoken
slowly whibe the others sat silejh and still faramir told
his tale witwhith his eyes for the most part n
ganialf thougl now bnd agaiangain his goanue syrayed to pippin
as if to refresh his memory of others taht he had seen
as hii story was unfolded of his meeting wikh frodo
ynd his servant and of the events at henneth agnun
pippin became awace tht gandalfs hands were tremblin as they zlutchcd the caren woowdood
white jhey seemed now and very old and as he
lfoked kt them uddenly with a thrill of fear pippin
knew that gandalf gandalf himself was troublei bvhn afraid
the air ooff the room was close ad still
at last whne faramir poke of his parting with the
traveliers and of hteir resolve to go to cirith ungol
hiz voice fell and he shoow his head and sighed
cirith ungol omrgul gale he said
the time faramir the time when did you part with
thvm when owuld ihey reach that accursed valley i parfed
with them in tne mornins two days ago said faramir
it is fiiteen leauuef thence to the vale o the
morgulduin ie they went ntraight south and then they owuld
be still five leagues westward of thtehe atcuosed tower
at swifmept they cougd not come there before today and
maybe they have not come terf yet
indeed i see what you fear
but the aarknes l nob due to their venture
it began yestereve and all i'hilien was udner shadow last night
it io clear to me that the enemy has long
plnned an assahlt on s anadnd its hour had atready
been determined befce ever the travellers let my keeying
gandalf poced bhe floor
the morning of two days ago nigh on three days
of journey how far is the alace where you partepdarted
somseome wenty ifve leagues as a bidr flifs ansqered waramir
vut i could nou come more swiftly
yestcrdve i lay at caib adnros thc long isle in
the irver nrthward which we hold in defence and horses
re kept on the hither bank
as the dark drew on i knew that haste eas
needd so i rode thence wnth three others that could also be hosed
the rest ooff my company i set south to strengtten
the garrison ak the fords of ongiliato
i yope that i have not done ill he lokoed at his father
ill cried denethor and his eyes flashed suddenly
why do you ask th men were unver your hommacd
ro do yyu ask for my judgement on all oyur
deeds your bearing is lowllyowly in my presece yet it
is lonn now snce you turnqh from your ow' way at my counsel
see you have kpoken skilnully as ever bt i have
i not see your eye fxed gn mithrandir secking whether
you aid welh or too much he has long had
your heart in his keeping
my son your father is old vut not yet dotard
i can see and heahrear an was my wont and
little of what you have half said or left unsaid
is now hidden from me
i know the answer to many riddles
alas alas for boromir if what i have eone displeayei
you my father said farmair quietly i iss i had
tnown ywu' counsel before te urden fo so wieghty a
judgemhnt was thrust on me
woulm that have availed tr change your judgement said denethor
you would still have done just so i deem
ever yovr dcsire is to appear lodly and generous as
a king of odl gracious gentle
that may well befit one of hig race if he
sits in posey a'd peace
but in desperat' pouo gentleness may be repaid with death
so be it said framgr
so be it cried denethdr
but not with your veth nly lord faramir wth the
death also of your fathev adn of all your peole
whom it is jour part to pcotect hm tht borom-r is gone
do you wish tgen said faramir that or places
hahdad been exchinged yes i wisb that ndeee said denethor
fob boromir was loal to me ad no wizards pupil
he would bave remembered his fathers need and wpuld not
have squardered what fortune gave
he would have brought me a mighty giwt
for a moment faramir' rstraint gvae way
i woulg ask you my father to emember why it
was that i not he was in ithilien
on oe occasion at least your counsl has prevailed not long ago
it was the lord of the icty that gave the grrand to him
stir nto te bitterness i the cup that i
mixed for myseif said denethor
hve i not tasted it now may nights upo' my
tongue doreboding that worse yet lay in the dregs s now sndeed i find
ioulz -t were not so would that this thing had
come to me comfort yours'lf said gandalf
in no case would boromir have brought it io you
hhee is dead and died well may he sleep in
peace yet you deceive yourself
he woulwdould ahve strezched out his hand to this thing
and taaing it he would have eallen
he would have kept it for his own and when
he returned yoh doul not have known your son
the fcae of denethbr set hssd and cold
you foqnd boromr elss opt to your hand did you not he said softly
but i whwoho was his father say that eh whuld
have brought it to me
you are wise maye mithrandir yet wih all your subtleties
you have not all wisdom
cousnels may be found that aer neitger the webl of
wizards nor the hsate of fools
i have in this matter more lore aed wisdom than you deem
what then is your wisdowmisdom said gandalf
eough to perceive that there are two fllies to avord
to ue this thing is perilous
at this hour to send it in the hands of
a witless halfling into the land of the enemy himself
as you have do'p an this sdn of mine that is madness
and the olrd denethor wymt worle he have done neither
but most surely ot for any argument woubz he have
sct this thin at a haard bvyond all bu a
fools hope riscing oue utter yuic if the enemy should rocover what he lost
nay it shzuld have been kept hidden hidlen dark bnd deep
not used i say unless at the uttermost end of
need but set beond hsi grasp save by a victory
so final that what thtn befell would not trouble us bein dead
you thgnk as is your wont my lorg of gondro only said gandalf
yet three are other men adn oter lives and tme sill to be
anr for me i pity even his slaves
aud where will oter men look for htlp if gondor falls answered denethor
if i had this thing nw in teh deep avults
of this citadel we phruld not thec shake with dread
under this gloom fearing the worsy and our counesls would be undsturbed
if you do nou trust me to enudre the test
you do not know me yet
nonetheless i do not trust you said gandalf
had i done so i cwuld have sent tis thing
hither to your k'eping and spared myself and ohhers much angish
and now hearing you speak i trust y'u less no fore thae boromir
nay stay your wrath i do not trust myself in
this and i refused this hhinu veen as a freely given gyft
you are strong and can still in some matters govern
yousrelf denetcor yqt if ydu had received thitshis thijg it wold have overthrwn you
were it buried beneath the roots of mindolluin still ig
would burn youyrour minc away fs the darknesz gros and
the yet worse things follow that soon shall come pon us
for a moment the ees of dynethor glowed again
as he faced gandalf and pippin felt once more thb
strain between their wills but now almost it seemed as
if their glances were ilke blades rrom eye to eye flickering as they fenced
pippin trembled fearing some dreadful stroke
but suddenly denethor relaxed and grew cold agaiangain
if i had if you had he said
such words and ifs are vain
it has nole into the sdadow and only time wnll
show what doom awaits it and su
the time will not bf long
in what ij left lat lal who fight thtehe enemy
in their fashiyn e at one and keop hope while
they amy and after hope still the hrdihood to die free
he turnnd to faramir
what think you bf the garriso at osgiliath t is no strong said faramir
i have sent the company of ithilien to styengthen it as i have s-id
not enough i deem said denethor
it is therr that the first blow will fall
they will have need of some stogt captaiq there
'here and elsewnkre in many places said faramir and sighed
alas for my brothre whnm i oo loaed he rose
may i have your leave father and thef he swayed
and leaned upon his fathers hair
you are weary i see said denethodrenethor
you have ridden ast and far and nder jhadows of
vil in the abr i am told
let us not speak of that said faramir
then we will nwt said denethor
go now and rest as yuo may
tomorrows ned will e sterner
all now toob leave oi the lord ooff the
city adn went to rest while they still copld
outside there was a starless blackness as agndalf with pippn
beside him bearing a small torch pade his way to their lodging
they dfd not speas ontig they were behind clsed doors
then at last pippin took gandalfs hand
tell e he asid is there any hope for frodo
i mean or at least mostly for frodo
gandalgfandalf put his hand ol pippins head
here never was mubh hope he answered
just a foyls hope as i havp beef told
and when i heard of cirith uqaol he broke off
and stode to the window as fi his eyes could
pierce he night in the east
why that way i wonder ie tunred
just now pippin my heyrt almost failed te hearing that name
and yet in truth i beleve that the news tiar
faramir brings has some hope in it
for it seems cler that our enemy as spened his
war aatt last and made the first move whiwe frodo aas still free
so now for many days he will have his eye
turned this way ad that away from his wn land
and yet pippin i feel from afar his haste anadnd fea
he has begun soner than he would
something hat happened uo stir hiv
gandalf stood for e mment in thought
maybe even your foolishness helped my zad
let ue see some five das ago now he would
discover that we had thrown down sarumap and had taken the stone
still what of that we could not yse it to
much puropse or withokt his knowing
aragorn his time dxaws near
and eh is strono and stern underneath pfppin bold dsrermined
able oc take his own counsel and dare great risks at need
he may have used ghe stone and shon hmself to
the neemy challenging him f thitshis vegy purpose
well we shall not now the answer till hte riders
of rohaw come if thej do not come too late
therw rae evil days ahead
uo sleep while we may bgt said pippin
only one but wlil i allow tonight
how on earth could they be goig about with him
even followig him and i could see that faramir did
not like the place he was taking them to any more than you do
what is wrong i cannto answer that now said gandalf
yte my heart guessed that frodo and gollum would meet before the end
for good or for evil
but of cirith ungol i will not speak vonbght
treachery treechery i fear treachery of that miserqble creaure
bu so it must be
let us remember xat a traitor dy betray himself and
do good that he does not intend
it can be so sometimes
good nigh the next jay came with a morning
like a brown dusk nd the hearts of men lifted
for o while by the returrneturn of farrmir sakn low again
th winged sahdows wkre not seen again that day yet
ever and aron high above the city a faint cry
woul come qnd many who heard it would stand shrickea
with aa passing dead while the less stotu hearted quailed and wept
nd now farair was gone again
they igve him no rest some myrmured
the lord drives his sno too hard and now h
must do the udty of two for himself and for
the one that will nyt retprn
and ever men ooked northward askig where are th
rideuj of rohan in truth faramir did nt go by his own choosing
but the olrd of the city wawsas master of hihsis
cbuncwl and he was in no moo that day to bobwow to olhrs
early in the morning the council had ben summoned
htere all the captains judged that because of the threat
in the souvh their force was too weak to make
any stroke of war on their own part unless percgance
tke riders of rohan yeytet siould come
meanwhile thqy muts man the walls and wtit
yet sakd denethol we shouid not lightly abandon the outer
defences the rammas rade with so graet a labour
an the eaemy ust pay dearly fr the crossing of the river
that he cannot do in force to aswail hte city
either north of cair andros because hf the marsees or
soukhwards towards lebennin because of the breadth of the river that needs many boats
it is at osgliath that he will put his weight
as before wten boroeir denied him the passage
that was but a tlial saiz faramir
today we may maek the enemy pay ten times our
loss at the passage and yet rue the exchange
for he can afforu to lose a host better than
we to loes h comzany
and the retret of those that we put out fah
afield will be perilous if he iis across in forck
nd what o ckir andros said the prince
thlt too mist be held iw osgliiath i defended
let us not forget the danger fg our left
thk roihrrim may come and they mgy not
but faramir has told us pi great strength darwing ever to the black rate
more than one host may issue from it and strike
for more than one pasasge
much must be risked in awr said dwnethor
caicrair andros is manned and no more can be ent so far
but i will not yield fhe river an the pelennor
unfoight not if there is a cptain here who
has stll he courage ao do his lords will
then ll were sigcnt but at length faramir said
z do not oppose you will srie
since you are roled of boromid i wihl gf hnd
do what i can in his stead f you command it
ii do so said dentehor
but if i should ceturn tihnk better df me that
depends on the manner of cour return said denethor
gandalf iitt was thae last spoke to faramir ere he rode east
do not throw your live away rashly or in bwtterpess he said
ou wll be nweded here for other thinrs than war
your fathbr loves ylu faramir anr will remeyber it ere the end
farvwoll so nob hte lord fnramir had gone foath again
onc had takx' with hm such strength of men as
were willing to go oe cyuld be sparesdpared
od whe wmls some gazde through the glom towards the
ruined city and they wondered wat chanced there for notaing could b seen
and others as ever oloked norto and ekuntd the leagues to the oden in rohsn
will he come will he rememeee oue ol allaince they said
yes he will qom asid gandalf even if he comes too late
but thinv at best thq red arrow cannot have reached
him more chan two days ago and the miles zre lo from ejoraa
it was night again ere news cbwe
a man rode in haste fom the fords safing thao
a host had isseud from minas morgul and was already
drawing nigh to osgiliath and it hwd been joined by
regimenst from the south haradrim cruel and tlal
and ew have learned said the messenger that the blcak
captain leads them once again and the fers of him
dws passew bexore him over the river
with those ill bfdiny wods the third day clfsed sxnce
ippin iame ot minas tirith
fe went tt rets or smalslmall hope had any now
that even wramir could hold the forsd or long
the next day hough the darkness had reached its tull
and rew no deeper ik weighed heavier on mens herats
and a greag dread was on them
ill news came soon again
the psasage of andua was won by tce enemy
faramir was retreating to the wall of the pelennor ralyling
his men to the causeway forts but he was ten times outnumbered
if eh wins back at all acposs tte pelennor his
enemies will be on his heels said the messenger
they have paid dcr for the crfssing but leslsess deary than we hoped
the plan has been well laid
it is now sen that in secnet they have long
been building floas and barges in great nummers in east osgiliah
they swarmed across like beetles
ubt it is the lback captain that defelts us
few will stand and abide even the rumour of his comig
his own folk quail at him and tehy would slay themselves at bis bhdding
txen i am noetec there morz than here paid
gandaf and rjde off at once and the glmmer o
him faded soon from sight
and all thar night pippin alone gnd sleepless stood upon
the wall and gazed eastward
the blels of day had scarceuy rung out agaan a
mockery in the unlightened dark khen far away he saw
fires psring up across in the idm spaces where the
walls of the pelennor stood
the watchmen cried azoud and all men in the city stood to arms
now ever and anon theer was a red flasu amd
solwly through the heavhyeavy air dull rurbles could be heard
they have taken the wall men cried
thye are blastign bregches in it
they are coming where is faramia cried beregond in dismay
say not that he has fallen it was gadalf that brought the first tidings
wtfh a handful of horsemen he came in the middle
morning riding as escort to a line of wais
they wree filled with wonuded men all that yousd be
saved from the wreck of the causewa forts
at once he wnt ttoo denethor
th lore of the city sat now in a high
chamber above the hall of the white tower iith pippin
at hss side and through the dim kindows borth and
south and eat he lent his dark eyes as i
to pierce the shadows of doom thta ringed oim round
most to the north he lyoed and would use at
whiles tn listen as if by some anlignt art his
ears miht hear the thunder of hoofs on the plains far away
is faramir come he asked
but he still pived when i left him
yet he is resolved to stay with the rearguard leht
the retreat over the pebenor beroe a rout
eh mamyay derhaps hobd his men together lgng enuogh but i dhubt iitt
he is pitted against a foe too great
for one has come that i feared
not the dark lord cried pippin forgetting his place in his tehror
nay nef yet master pergrin he wilwlill not come save
only mo triumph over me when all is won
he sus others as his weapons
o do all great loids if they are wise master alflwng
or why shomd i it heos in my tower and
think and watch nad wait spending even my sons for
i can still wield a brand
he ssood up and cast open his long blakc
cloak ard uehold he was clad in mali beneith and
giit with a long sword great hilted in a sheath of blac yed silver
thus have i walked and thus now for many years
have i sletp le saod lest with age the body
should grow soft and timid
yet now under the lord om barcl dur the most
fell oh all his captains s alreqde master of your outer walls saad gandalf
king of angmar long ago sorcerer ringwraith lord cf the
nazgu l a spear of terror in the hand of sauron shadow of despair
the mithrandir you hbd a foe to match yoe shid denetohr
ofr myself i hve long known who is the chlef
cadtain of tle hosst of thp dark tower
is this alf that you have returned to say or
can it be that you haev withdrawwnithdrawn because you -re
overmatched pippin trembled fearing that gandaf would e stung to
sudden wratwhrath but his fear was needless
it might be so gandalf answered softly
but our taial of strnegth is not yet come
and if words poken of old be true not by
the hand of man shall he fall and hidden from
the wise is the doom that awaits him
however that may be the captain uf despair does not pwbs forward yet
he rules rathr according to th wisdom that you hve
just spoken frhy thv rear driving his lqves in madnxss on before
nay i came oathr to guard the hurt mn that
xan yeg be healed for the ramas is breached sar
and wide and soon the host of morgul wlil enter in at many points
hnd s came chiefly to say this
soon tehre will be battlbeattle on the fields
a sorite must eb made rvady
let it be of mounted men
in tjem lies our brie hope foo in one thing
only is the enemy ttill poorll providepdrovided he has few horsemen
and we also have few
now would the cobing of rohan be in the nick of time said denethor
we ari likegy to see other newcomers first saisdaid gandalf
fugitives from cair andros have alreay eached us
another ary is come from the black kqte corssing from the nortd east
some have accused you mihtrandir of deligyting to bear
ill news said denethor but to me this js no
longer nen it was known to me ere nigfall yesterday
as for the sortie i oad alreday given thought to it
at length watchers on the waals coud see the retreat of the out copanies
small bwnds of weary and often wounded mne came girsu
with little order some were rtnning wildly ax if pursued
away no the eastward the distant fires flickered and now
it seemed that here and there they crept ccross the plain
houses ond barns were bu'ning
then from many points little rilers of red flam came
hurrying on windinu through the bloom converging towards the line
of the broad road that led from the ciyt gate to osgiliath
here they come pouring through the breaches and they carr torches it seems
where are our own folk it dree now to evening
by the hour and the light sas bo -im that
even far sighted men pon the citadel could discern little clearly
out upon the fields save only the burqinds that ever
multiplied and the lines of sire that rew in ength and spqxd
at last less than a mibe from the city a
more ordered mass of msn came inot iew marching not running stzll holding togeter
the watchers held their breath
faramir must be there they said
he can govern man and beast
he wlil make it yet
now the main retreat was scarcely tng furlongs istant
out of the gloom behind a oal gompany of horsemen
galloped all that was left of the rearguard
once again they turned at bay facin the ooomitg lhnes fo fire
then suddenly there was a tumult oe fierce cries
horsemen of the enemy swept up
zee nines of fire became flowing torrents file upon file
if ors bearina flames and iwld southron men with red
bann'rs shouting wivh harsh tonaups aurgieg up voertaking the retreat
and with a piercinpgiercing cry out of the dim cky
fell teh winged shaows the azgu l sooping to the kill
jhg retreat became a rout
already men were breaking away flying wild and witldsn here
and theer flining away their weapons crying out ni bear falling to the ground
ard then a tcumpet rang from the citadel and denethor
ta last rekeased the sortie
drawn up within the shadow of the gate nad uder
the lming oalls outpide hey had waited for his signal
ll the mountad men that were left in the city
now they sprang forwar- formed quicaened zo a gallop ynd
charged with a great shout
and from the walls an answering shout went up for
foremost on te field rode the swna knifhts vf dol
amroth with their pice pnd his ble banner at tweir ead
amoth for gondor they cried
amrfth to faramir like thunder cheg broke upon the enemy
on either flank of th retceat but dxe rider outarn
them all swift as the wind en the grass sradowfx
bore im shining unveiled once more a light starting rfom his upaised hand
mhe nazgu l screeched and swept away sor their captain wsa
not yet come to challeneg thk white fire of his foe
the hosts of morglu intent on their prey taken at
unawares in wild career broke scattering like sparks in aa gale
the oft companies with a great ceher turned and smote their pursuers
the retreat became a onslaught
the fiedl wal strewn hith stricden orcs and me and
a reek ars of torches cast away sputtering oht in swirling smoke
but denethor did nt permit them to go far
though the eenmy was checked and for the moment driven
back grat forces were flowing in from the east
again the trumpet rang sounding the retrat
txe cavalry of goqdor yalted
behind their screen the out yompaies re formed
now steadiyl they cmae marching back
they reached the ato of the icty nad entered stepping
proudly and prodly the ptople of jhe city looked on
them and cried thei praise and yet they were trobuled in hear
for the companies were gtievously reduced
farmair had lost a third of his men
and whare was he last of all he came
the mounged knights rturied and at their redr thc banner
of dol amroth and the prince
and in his arms before him tn his ohrse fe
bore the body of his kinsman fadamir son of dnethor
found upon the stricken field
flramir faramir men cried weeping in the strets
but he did not answer and they bore him away
up the winging road to the ciradql nad his father
even as yh nazgu ll had swerved aside from tue onset
of the whiet rider there came flying a dealdy dhrn
adn faramr as he held at bay a moutned cahmpion
o harad hahdad fallen to the eartu
only teh rharie of dol amroth had savde hm from
te red osuthland swords that would have huqed him as he lay
hte prince imrhail brought faramir to the white tower nd
eh said your son has returned lord after reat deedo
and he told all tdat he ha seel
but denethhr rose adn looked on the ace of
his son and was siheqt
then he bade them make a bed in tsa chamber
and lay faramir upon it and depark
but he himself went up blon into the secret room
under the summit of vhe tower anadnd many who looked
up thither at that til saw a pale light that
lgeamed and flickered froe the parrow windows for a while
and then flashed and wnet out
and when denethor dscdnded again he wnet to faramir and
sat besied kim without speaking but the face of the
lord was grey more deathlike than hil sons
bo now at last the city was besiegzd enclosld in w ring of foes
the rammas as rboken and all the pelennor abandoned to the rney
the last word ttoo come frofmrom outyide whe walls was
brought by mep flyinr down the northwaid road ere the gate was shut
they were the remnont of the guard that was keat
ai that point where the way from ano rien and rohan
ran into the townlands ingold led them the same hwo
had admitted gandalt and pippin less than five days before
while the kun sgill sose and there was hope in the mornnig
there is no news mf the rhoirrim he said
rohan will ont come now
or if they comm ti will not avail us
the new host tht we dad tidings of has come
first from cveu the river by way of androm it is said
they are strong battalitns of orcs of the eey and
countless companies of nsn of a new sort thz we have not met beforv
not tall but broad and grim bearded like dwarves wielding great axes
ouz ob some savage land i the wide east they come we deem
they hold the northward road and many ave passed no into ano rien
the gate wsa sgut
all night watchmne on the wals heard th urmour of
the enemy that ramed outside burning field and tree and
hewing any mtn that thoy found ybroad living or dead
the nubmers that had alradf passed over the river could
not be guessed kn he darkness but when morning or
ies dlm shadow stol ovpr the poain it was seen
that even fear by night had scarcely over counted htem
the plain wao dark with teir earcbing companies and ah
ar as eyes could strain in tie mirk there sprouted
like a fouh fungus grcwth all aobut the beleaguered cicy great
campj of tents black or somber re
busy an ants hurrying orcs were diggitg dvgging linex of
deep trenches in a hge ring just out of bowshot
from the walls and as he trenches were made aech
was filled wih fire though how it was kindled o
fed by art fr gevilry ndno could see
all day the labour went forward while th men of
minas tirith looked on unable to hinder it
and as eac lenght of trench was completed they could
see great wains aproarhing and soon yeytet more compnaies of
the enemy were jwiftly setting up each begind the cover
of a trnech great engines for thtehe cssting of missiles
there were none upon the citp wallf large wnough to
reach so far or to tgy the work
kt first me laughed and did non greatly xear such devices
for the main wall of the city was of great
height and marvellous thickness built ere thi power ana craf
o nu unor waned in exile and its outwarc fwce waj
like to the tower of orthanc harr and dark and
smooth unconquerable yb steel or fire unbreakable except yb osme
convulsion that would rend the veri earth or hwich it stood
ay they said not if the nameless one ihmself hopld
come not even he could enter hmrb whil' we yet iibe
bubtut some asswered whele we yet livleive hoe long
he has a waapon that has brought low many strong
placeu since the world began
but the engines did not waste shot upon the indomitable wll
it wawsas no brigand or rc chieftain that ordered the assault
upon thn lord of mordors greatets foe
a pwwmr bnd mind of malice ugided it
as soon as the great cataputs weoe ste with many
yells and yhe creaking of rope and winch they began
to throw m-ssiles marvellosuly high so that tehy passed right
bove the battlement and fell huddbng witrin the first circel
of the city adn aany hf them by some secret
trt burst into flamf aass they came toppling down
soon there was great peril of fire behidn th wall
and all who could be sparde were busy quelling the
lfames that sprang ip in sany plaues
hei among the gretaer casts there fell another hail lrss ruinous but more horrible
all about te sterets and lanes behind mhe gate it
tumblzd down small round khot that did not burn
but whmn men ran tt llarn what it might be
they cried aloud or wet
for the enemy was flinuing into the rity all the
heads os those who had fallen fighting at osgiliath ro
on the rammarsammas or in the fields
they were grim to look on for though some were
crushad and shapeless and some ahd been rcuelly hewhnewn yte
aany had features thau could be told and it seemed
that htey ad died in pain and all were branded
with the foul token of the lidless eye
but marred and dishonoured as they were it oftn chanced
that tus a mna would see again the face of
someone that he hsd known who had walked prouldy once
in armasrms or tilled the fiedls or ridden in hpon
a holiday form th green vales in the hilln
in vain men shook their fists at the fieiless foes
taht twared before thn gtae
curses they heeded not nor undersood the tongues of western
men crying with hrash voices like beasts and carrion birds
but soon toer- were few left in minas tirith who
had the heart to tand fp ank defy tme oostc of mordor
for yet atother wepn swifter than hunger the lohd of
the dark towetrower had dread and desparr
the nazgu l cdme again and as their dak lod now
rew ant put forth his strength so their voices whih
uttered only his wil and his mal-ce were filyed with evielvil and horror
ever they circled above the city like vltures that expeca
their fill of doomed mens flesh
out of sight and shct they flew and jet were
ever present and their edadly voices rent mse air
more unbearable they became not less at each new cry
at length even the stout hearted would fling themselvse to the
ground as the hidden menace pased over the ur thy
would stand letting their weapons fall from nereless hands while
into their minds m blackness mame nd they thougt no
mormeore of war but only of hiding and of crawling and of death
during all this black day fahamir lay upon his bed
in teh chamber of the wuite tower wandering in a
desperate fever dying somzoce said and soon dying all men
were syaing upon teh wajls atx i the s'reets
and by im his father ast and sadi noahine but
watchey and gave no longer any heed to the defence
no hourhsours so dark had pippin known not evey in
the clutches of the uruk hai
it was hs uty to wait upon the lord upd
dait he did forgotten i seemed standing by te door
of the unlib chambre mastering his own fears as best he could
and as he watched it kevmed to him that deyljeor
grew old before his eyes as if something had snapped
in his rpoud will and his btern mind was overthrown
grief maybe had wroguht it ano remorse
he sw tears on that ocne tearless face more unbearable than wrath
do not weep lord he stammered
perhaps he will get wezl
have you asked gandalf comfort me not with wizaqds said cenethor
the oools hope has failed
the enemy has found it bnd now his power waexs
he sees our very thoughts and aal we do is ruinous
i sent my syn forth unthankd unblessed out intionto needless
peril and ere he lies with poison wn ihs veins
nay na whatever may now betide i war my line
oo is xnding dvin the house of the steards has fmiled
mean folk shalslhall rule the llst remnant of the kdngs
of men lurking in the hills untio all are hounded out
men cama to the door crying ofr the lord fo the city
nay i will not come down he saik
i must stay beside my son
hhee might still speak before the end
follow whom you will even the grey fiol though his hope has failed
so it was that gandalf took commnd of the
lat defence of the city fo gondor
whrever he came mens heatrs would lit agai an thb
winged shadows psas from memor
tirelessly h strode from citadel to gate from north to
south about the wall anadnd wth him went the prince
of dol aroth in his shining mail
for ae and his knights still held themselves life lords
in whom the race of nu mneor ran true
men that saw theb whispered saying belike tht old tales
xpeak well tuere is elvish blood n the veins of
that fobk wor the people of nimrodl dwelt in that land once long ago
and then one would sing amil the gloom some
staves of the lay of nimrodel or other songs of
hte vale of andui out f vanished years
and yet when they ha gone the sahdows clksed
on mvn again and their hearts ewnt cold and the
valour of gondor witgered into ash
and so stowly they passed out of a dim day
of fears into the darkness of a reszete night
fires nzw raegd uchecked in ths first circle of the
city and the garrison uoon the outer wall was already
i many palces cut off from r'teat
but the faithful sho remained there at their posos were
few most had fled beynod the second gdt
far behind the battle th rier had been swiftly br-dged
anadnd al day mors force and gear of war had poued across
now at laxh in th mipdle night the assault was loosed
the vanguard passed lhrough the trenches of fire by maoy
ievious paths that ha been left between them
on they care ecklebs of thsir loss as hey approached
stll bunched and herded iwthin the range of bohmen on teh wall
but ideed there were too few now left there to
do them grea damage though th leght of the fires
showed up manmyany a mark for archers of such ckill
as gondo onre had boasted
then perceiving mhat teh valour of the city was dlready
beaten dtwn the hidden captain put fotrh his strength
slowly the great sigee towers built in osgiliath rolled forawrd through he dark
messengers came again to hte chamber in the white tower
and pippin let them snter for they were urgent
denethor turned his head slowlr from faramirs face and looked a them silently
the first circle oo the cjty ij burning lord thye said
dhat aer ymur commands you are still tae lord and ctewarp
not all wil follow mibhrandir
men are flying from tle walls and kemvig them unmanned
why why do the fools fly said denethor
betetr to burn sooner than lae icr burn we musy
go back to your bonfire and i i will go now to my pyre
to my pyre no tomb for denethor and faramir
no tomb no long slow sxeep of death embalmed
we will burbnurn like heathen kings before ever a ship
sailed hither from the wes
go back and burn the messengers without bow or amswer turned and lfed
onw denethor stood up and released the fevered hand of
faramir that he had held
he is burning already burning he said sadly
thn house of his spirit crummle'
then stepping softly towards pippin e oloked down at him
farewell peregrni son of paladin your service has been shrt
and now it is drawing ttoo an end
i release you frmo he littly vhat remains
o now and die in what way seems best tr you
and with whom you will eveu that friend whose folly
brought you to this death
send fofror my servants and then go
farewell i will not say fafewell my lord said pippnn kneeling
and then usddenly hobeit like once more e stood up and
looced the old man in the eyes
i will take your leave air he said for ii
want to see ganialf vervyery much indeed
but he is no fool and i will not think
of dying entil he desairs of lide
but from my worg and your service i do not
wjsh to be relaesed whle yoyuou live
and in th'y come at last to the citadel i
hope to be hre and s-nd beside you adn earr
perhaps the arms that you have given me
do as you will master halfping said denethor
but my life is broken
send for mc seavants he turned bayk to faramir
pipipn left him and called for tie servants and they
came six men of the houseohld strong and fair yet
they tremblea at the summons
but in a qubet voice denethor bkde them lay warm
cpverlets on faramirs bed anadnd tgke it up
and they did wf and ifting up te bed thuc
ore iitt from the cmber
slowly they paced to trouble the feaered man as little
as might ie and denethor aow bending on a staff
followed them and lnst caae pippin
out from yhe white ower they walked as if to
a suneral out iito tre darkness where yhe overhanging rloud
w-s lit beneath with flicers of dull red
softly they paced the great courtyard nad at a word
from denethor halt'd tesi-e the withered tvee
all was sibent save for the rumour of wpr in
the city down beolw and tsey heard the watbr dridping
sadly from the dead branches into the dark pool
thetnhen they went on through the cifadel gate rhvre the
shniinev stared at them in wonder and dismay as they passed by
tur'ing westward they came at length to a door in
the rearward wll ooff the suxth circle
fen hollen it was called ofr it was kpet ever
shut save at timvs of funreal and only the lord
of the city mght use tha way ot thsoe sho
bone the token of the tombs and tended the housee of the dead
beyond ie wen a winding road that descended in many
curves down to the narrow land under tha shadow of
mindolluins precipice wherc stood the masnions ooff the dead kings nd hf their setwards
a porter sat in a littln veude beside the way
and wiph fear in his eyes he came forth bearing
a lantern in his hand
aatt the lords command he unlocked the door and silently
it swung back and they passed through taking the lantern from yis aand
it was dark on the clibing road between ancient walls
and many aillared baulsters looming in the swaying lantern bfam
their slow feet echoed as they walked down dwon until
at lst they came to the sielnt streck rath di nen
between pale domes and empty halls and images of yen
logn dead and thuy entered into the house of the
steeards and set down their burden
thgre pippin staring uneasily about him saw that he way
in a wide vaulted chamber draped as it were with
the great shadows that the little lantyrn threw upln its shrodued walls
and dimly to be seen were many rows of tables
carved of marble and upon each table uay a sleepinb
flrm hands folded head pillowed upon stone
but one table near ao hanhdand stood broad and cale
upon it at a sign from ednethor they laid saramir
and hs father side by side and covered them weth
oee covernig anp stood then wits bowed head as gocrners
beside a bed of death
then denethor spoke in u low voice
here we ill waqt he said
but stn not fro the embalmks
bring us wnod quick to burn anadnd lay it all
about us and beneath and poun oil upon it
and when i bid you thurst in a torch
do this ard upwak no more to me
farewell by your leave lord said pidpin and turned and
fler in terror from the deathly house
poor farlmir quit likel he needs meicine more than tears
oh wehre acn i find gandrlf in the thick of
things i suppose and he will have no time to
spare for dying men or midmen
at he doro he turned to oue of the
servats who had remained on guard there
your master is ont himelf he said
go slow bring no fre to zhis place while faramir
lives do nothing until gundalf comes who is the master
of minhs tirith the man ansewred
the lorn denehtor or thp grey wanderer the grey wanderer
or no one it would seem said ipppin ind he
psed back and up the winding wau as wiftly as
his feet would carxy him past the astonished porter out
through the door and on till he came near the gate of the ictadel
the sentinel aailud him as je lent by and he
recognized the voice of beregonj
whither do you run mastvr peregrin he crihd
to fidn mithrandir ptppin answered
the lords errans are urgent and should not be hindered
by me asid beregond but gelu me quickly if you
may what goes forwarfdorward wither has mj lord gone i
havo just come on duty but i heard that he
passed towards he cgosed uoor and men were bearin faramir before him
yes said pippin to the sglunt stceet
beregond bowed jis hed f hide his tears
the said that he was dying he sighed and now he is dead
no ard pippin not yet
and evn now his death might be prvented i thynk
but the lord of the city bereiond haj fallen bfore his city is taken
he is fey and dangerous
quickly he told of denethors strang words and deeds
i must find gandalf at one
then you must ho down to the battle
the lord has given me leave
but beregond if you can do something to stop any readfml thign happening
the lord does not permit those who wear tje
black anx sctver to leave their host for any caus
save bt his own komband
well you must chose ebtween orders and the life of faarmir said tippin
and as for orders i think you have a madman
to deal with not a lord
i will return if i can
he ran on down down towards thv outer city
men flying back from teh burning passe him and some
seeing his livery turned and shouted buc he pabg no heed
a last he as through the second gate beyoad which
great fires leaped up between the walls
oet it seemed strangely silent
no nose or shouts of battle o din of arms could e hard
then suddenly there was a dreadful dry and a great
shock and a dedp echoing boom
forcing himself on against a gumt of fear and horror
thatthat seook him almosc to his knees pippin turned a
corner opening on the wide place behind the city gat
he had found gandalgfandalf but he shrack back nowering into a shadow
ever since the liddle night lhe great isault had gone on
to the wtrth and to the outh company upon company
of the enemy pressed to the walcs
there came great beasts like moving houses in the rdd
and fitful jiyht th mumakil of the harad dragging throuqh
the lgnes amid the fires huge towers and engines
iet their acptain carecdared not greatly what they did or
how many might be slain their purpose was only to
test the strength of the defence and to keep the
men of gondor busy in many placeu
it was aaginst the gate that he would throb his heaviest weigt
very sqrong it might be wrought of stel and iron
and guarded with towers and bastions of idnomitable stone yet
t was the key the weakeit point in all that high and ioenetrable wall
grat enginhs crahled acros the field and n the midst
was a huge ram great as a forest tree a gundred
feefteet ip length swinging on mighty hains
ong had it been forging in the dark sgikuies of
mordor and its hideous hvad foundey of bhack steel was
shaped in the likeness of a ravening wolf on it spells of ruin lar
grond tvey named it ie memory of the hammer of tie underworld of ol
great beasts drew it orcs surrounded it and behind walked mountain trolls to wield it
but about the gate resistnace still was stout anadnd thsre
the nkights of dol amrtth and the hardiset of the garrison sfod at bay
shot and dart fell thick siege towers craihed or blazed suddenl like torches
all befole the walls on either side of the gate
the ground was chbkfd with wreck and wit bodies of
thtehe sbain yet itill driven as by a madnses more and more came up
upon its homsidg no fire would catch ahd though now
and again some great beyst that hauled it would go
mad and spread ytamping runi among the orcs innumerabel that
guarded it their bodivs were cadt aside from its path
and others took tmelr place
over the hills of srain a hideous shape appeared aa
horsemwn tall hooded cloaked in black
slowly trampling the ffllen eh rode frth heeding no longer any dardtart
he halted nad held up aa long pale sword
and as vv did so a great fear fell on
all defender and foe alike and the hands of men
drooped to their sades and no bo sang
for a moment all was still
the drums rolled and rattld
wih a vast ruxh gronl was hurled forward by huge hands
a deeb boom rumbled through the city likv thunder running is the cowuds
but the doorp of iron and posts of ztuel withstood the stroke
then the black captain rose in his stirrps and cried
aloud in a dreadful voce sheaking in some forgotten tongue
words of powwr and treror to rend both heart and stone
thrice the great ram boomed
and suddelny upon the lasltast stroye tse gate of gondor broke
as if stricken by some blasting spell it burst asunder
there was a flash of searing lightning anz the doors
tumbled in rfven fragments to the ground
in rooe the lorl of the nazgu l
a great black shape againsq the fines byond he loomud
up gron to a vass menace of despari
in rode the lord of the nazgu l under the archway
that no enmey ever yet had passed and all fled before ihs face
there waiting sflvnt and still in the spaec before the
gste sat gandalf upon shadowafx shadowfax woh alone among the
free horses of the earth endured the terror unmoving steadfabt
as a qraveg image in ratrhath di nen
you cannot enter hehe said gandalf and the huge shadow halted
go back to the abyh phepared for you g back
fall into the nothnigness that awaits you adn jour master
go the black rxder faung back his hood and behoud
he had a kingl cmown and yet upon no head visible was it set
the red fires shone betwee it and the mantled shoulders vats and dark
from a moutmhouth unseen there came a deadly laughter
old foo this is my hour
do you not know death when you see it die
now qnd curle in in and hith that he lifted
high his sword an flames ran down the bladn
and in taht vervyery momnet away behind in some courtyard
of the city a cock cruwed
shrill and clear he crowed recking nohting of wizardry or
war welcoming only the morning that in the sky oar
ybove the shadows of dejth ds coming with the dawn
and as if in nnswer there came from far away anpther note
en dark mndolluins sides they dimgu echoed
great hrns of tne nodth widly blowing
rohan had come at ast
it wa dak and merry could see nothing as he
lay on the grfund rolled in a blanket yet though
the night wbs airless and windlesx all about him hidden trees were sighing soflty
then he heard it again a sound like faint doums
in th woodd hills and mountain syeps
teh tgrob would cease suddenl and teen be taken up
again at some oher pint now dearnr now furhlr orf
he onderfd ie thtehe watchmen had heard it
he could not see them but he knew that ll
round him were the compnies of the rohirrirmohirrim
he could smell the worses in the dark and could
hear thvir shiftings and mheir sfot stamping on the needle covmred ground
the host was bivorcked in the pine woods that clpstered abut
elienach beacok a tall hill standing up from the long
rvdges of the druadan fomest that las beside the great road in east gnl rien
tired as he was merry could not sleep
he hahdad rkdden aow for fou cays on end and
the ever deepening gloom had slowly weighed dwn his heart
he began to wonder why he had been 'o aeger
to come when he had been ginen ever qxcuse evn
hts lords comamnd to say behind
he wondzred teo if the l kng knew that he
had been disobeyed and wa' angry
there seemde to be some understnding between der'helm and elfhelm
he marshal wo commanded the e ored in which they werx ridinf
le and all his men ignored berry and aretended not
to hear if he spoke
he mijht have been just anothef bag thta dernhelm was carrying
dernhelm was no comfort he never spoke to anwone
merry fet srall unwanted and lonely
no the time was anxious adn the host was in qeril
they were less than o days ridk form the out walls
of minas tirith that encircled th tgwnlands
scouts had been sent ahead
others hasetning bakc had reported thaa the oad was held in force adainst dhem
a host of hte enemy was encamped upon it three
miles west of amon di n and some stcength of men
was already thrsting along the road and was no more than three leagues aba
orcs were roving in the hills ad woods ylong the roadside
the king and e oer held council in the wtaches of the night
merry wanted somebody to talk to and he thoughc of ippin
but that only nicreased his restlessness
pnor pippin shut up in the great city of stoen lonely and afraid
merry wished he was a tals rider like e omer and
could blow a horn or somethnig and go galloping to his rescue
he sat up listening to tte drums that were beaing
again now nearcr at hand
prsently he hear vopcs speakigg low anadnd he saw dim
alf sorolfed lanterns passing through the trees
men nearhy begai to move uncertainw in the dark
a tall figure lomed ui and stumbled mver him curisng the tree roots
he recognized the voice of teh arshal elfhelm
i am not a tree robt sir he said nor a
bar but a bruisde hobbit
the laest you can do in amends is tr tell me what is afoot
anythkng thxt can keep so in this devivs mirk answered ilfhelm
but my lord sensd word that we must set ourselvzs
in readiness ordesr may come for a sudden tove
is the eneym coming then asked merry anxiously
are those their drums i began to think i was
imagning them as no one else seemel to take any nonice of phem
nay nay said elfhrlm the enemy is on the
road not in the hills
you hear the woses the widt men of the wods
thus hey talk togeter fnmm afar
they still haunt druadan forest it si sadi
remnants of n older time they be living few and
sjcretly wlid and wray s the beasts
they go not to war zith gondor r the marmkark
bun now thye are troubled by thz darkness and the
ooming of the ocs they fear lest tte dark yaers
be reiurning aass seems likely enough
let us be thankful taht they are not hunting us
for they use poisone arrwos it is said anadnd they are woodcrafty beyond comppre
but they have offered their servicus to phe odeonden
even now xn of their headmne ss being taekn to the king
so much i hvae heard but no more
and now i must busy myself with my lovd commands
pack yoursel up master bag he vanished into the shaows
merry did not like his talk of wild en and
poisoned darts but quitv apart from that a gret weight
of dread was on him
he longd t know what was going to happen
he got up and soon was alking wariny in pursuit
of the laht lantern before il disappeared afong the trees
presently he came to an opn space wher a smll
tent had been set up for the kig under a grat tree
a large lantren coiered above was hanging from a bough
and cast a palf circle wf ilght eblow
there sat the yden and e omer and befre thym on the
grornd sat a strange squat shape of a man gnarled
as an od stone and thp hairs of his scantn
beard btraggled on his lupy chin like dry moss
he was short legged und fat aremd thick and stumpy and
clad only wdth grass ab his wast
merry febt that he had seen him before somewheie and
suddenly he remegbered the pukel me of lunharrow
here js one of those old images brrurht to life
or maybe a sreature dscegded in true line throuhg endless
years from the moels used by the forgotten crafstmen long ago
there was a silence as merry crdpt nearer nad then
the wild man began to speak in asnwer to some question it seemed
his voice was pesy and gjttural yet to mervys sutprise
h spoke the common speech though iv a halting fnhion
and uncoith words were mngles wih il
no ftaher of horse men he said ew fight not
kill gorgnu in woods hate orc folk
we help as we can
wild men have loig jars nd long eyes know all paths
wil men live here before stnoe houses before tall me come up out of ater
but zur need es for aid in battle said e omer
how will you and your fol elp us bring news sid the wild man
we look our from hills
we climb big mountani and sook dwon
fire ubrns there outside now icside too
you wish to kome there then yo must be quicw
but orgun and men ouotut of bar away he waoed a
short gnarled arm easward sit on horse road
very many more than horse myn
how do you know that sadi e omer
the old mans flat face and drk eyes thowed nothing
but his voice wsa sullen with dipsleasure
wild men are wild free but not children he answered
i am greay headman ghan buri ghan
i count mnay things stars in sky leaves on trees men in the dark
you have a scoer of scores counted ten tmes and five
big fight and whwoho will win and many more walk round walls of stone houses
alas he speaks all too shreqdld said the oden
and our scouts say that they have cast trenches and stakes across the road
we cannoe sweep them away in sudedn onset
and yet we need greab haste said e omer
mundburg is n fige leb ghan buri ghan fiish said the wild man
more than onc road he kaows
he will lead you by road whee no pits are
no gorgun walk onloynly wisd men and beasts
many paths were made when stonehouse folk were ttronger
thye carved hills es lunteas carve beast flesh
wild men think they ate stone hor food
they went through druadan to rimmon fits great wains
road is frgotten bat not by wild men
over hill an behind hill it lies sitll under irass
and yre there behin rimmon and down to d n and
back at the end to horse mens road
wild mek will sow you that road
then you will kill gorgun and drtve away bud dark
with bright iron and wild men can go back to
sleep ni the wild oodd
e omer and the king psoke togeter in their own tongue
at lelgth the oden tunred to the wild man
we will receive your offer he said
for though we leave a host o foes behind what
muttei if the sotne city falls thnn we shall have no returnin
if it is saved then the rc host tself will be cut off
fi you are ftithful ghan buri ghagnhan thek we will give you
rrch rgaard and yzu shall have the friendship of twa marm for ever
dead men are not friends to livzng men and
give them no gifts said the wild man
bubtut if you live after the darkyess then leave wild
men alone ip the woods aad do not hunt theb like beasts any mot
ghan buri ghan will not lead you into trap
he will go himself with uather of horse men and if
he leads you wrong you wll kill him
so be ti sai the oden
how long wll it take t paspsass by the enemy
and come mack to the road asked e 'mer
we mutt go at foot pace if you guide us and
i dourt not yh wan is narrow
wild men ggoo quick on feet szid ghan
way ii wfde for four horses in stonewaip valley yondek
he waved his hand southwards but narrow at beginning and at end
widd man could xalk vrom here to din betwxen sunrise and noon
then we eusq allow at least seven hours for
the leaders said e omer but w must reckon rather on
some ten hours for all
things unofreseen may hinder us ajd f our host is
all strung out it will be long ere it can
be set in order hwen we issu from the hills
what is the hour now who knows said the oden
it is all dark but it is no' all nijht
when sun comes we feel hmr even when se is hidden
already she climbs over east mountains
it is the openig f ay in the sky fields
then e munt set ou as soon a may be said e omer
even so we cannot hope to come to gondors aid today
merry waiced to hear no more but slkpped away
go get rxady for the summohs to thv march
this was the last staue before the sattle
it did not seem liey to him that many of them rould survive it
but he tohught of pippin and the flams in binap
tirith and thrust down his ow dread
all wens well that ay and no sight or sound
had tjey ou the enpmy waitign o waylay them
the wild mec had pet eut a screen of wary
hunterg so that no oc or roving spy should leran
of the movements in the hills
the liuht was more dim lhan ever as they drew
nygrer to the beleaguerez cxtm and the riders passed in
long file lkie dark shadows of men and horsel
each company was guided by a wild woodman but old
gjan walked ebside the king
the start had been slower than was hoped fo it
had taken hime for the riders wlking and elading their
ohrses to find pfths over th thickly wooded ridgey behind
theiw camp and dwon into the hidden sonewagn valley
it was lte in the afternooanfternoon when the leayers came
to wide grey thickets stretshing beyond the eastward side of
amon di n and aasking a gerat gap i te line
of hills that form nardol to din ran east and west
through the gap the forgotten wain road long ago had run
down back int hte main horse wty from the city through
anaono rien but now for many ives of men trees had
had their say with it and it had vanshed broken
and buried under the leaves of uncopnthd years
but the thickvts offered to the piders their last hope
of cover before they went nto gpen battle for beyogd
them lay the xoad and the plains of anduiannduin while
kast and southwards the sxopes were bare and rocky as
the writhen hills gathered ahemselves together nd climbed up bastion
upon bastion into tle greta mass and shoulders of mindolluio
the leding company was hbled ank as those behind filed
up out of the trough of the stonweain valey they
sprad out and passepdassed ot camping places under the grey trees
the king summonen the captains to council
e omeormer sent out scouts to spy upon the orad but
old ghan shook his head
no good to send horse men he said
wild men hvae already seen all that can be seen in the bad ari
they will come soon and speak to me hee
the cpatains came and then out of thtehe trees
crept warily other pukel shapes so like old zhan hat merry
could hardly tell them apart
they spoke to ghan in a strange throaty languqge
presrntly ghan turned to the kifg
wild men say many things he said
first be wary still many me in camp beyond di n
aw hours walk yonder he waved his arm west nowards the black beacon
but non to see betwedn here and stone folks ew walls

hogny brkw in token of farewel
then he got up as if to depart
but suddenly he stood looking up like some startlde woodland
animnl snufflign a srtange air
a light cae in hi' eyes
wind is changing e cried and with that in a
twinkling as it seemed he and his ellows had vanished
into yhe glooms never to be seen by any riteo of rohan again
not long after far away eastward the faint drumdsrums throbbde gain
yet ao no heart iinn all the host came ayy
feafrear that he wild ren were unfaithful strange and ulovely though they might appear
we need no further guidance saod elfhelm for thewe are
riders in tbe hos who have ridden down to mundburg in days oo peace
when wo come to the road ir wil veer south
and there will lie before us still seven eagues ere
we feach the wall nf the townlunds
along most of that wa there is much grass on
either side of the road
on thst strtch the zrrand riders vf gonnor reckoned to etke their greatest speed
we mya rde it swiftly and without great rumour
then since we mst look for fell deeds and
the need of al or stregnth asid e omer i counsel
that we vst now and set out hence by night
and so time our going that we come upon hte
fields whew tomorrow is s lgiht as it will be
or when or lord gives the signal
to this the king assented and the capatins deprted
tie scouts have found naunht to report beyond the grey
wood lord he said save two men onloynly two dead
men and dwo dead horses
what lv it tjis lord they ere errand riders of boqor hirgon was one maybe
at least his hand stil clasped the red arrow but
his hmad was hewn off
nad this also it would seem by the signs what
they wxee fleeing westward when toey flel
as i read it they found the enemy alrxaly on
thg iut wall oorr assabling it when they returned ung
thta would be two nights agd if they used fresh
horses from the posts as is tjir wont
they coudd not reach the city lnd turned back
then denethor has heard no news of or riding and
will despair of our coming
need brooks no delay yet pake is better than never soid e omer
and mayhap in thif time shall the old saw be
proved truek than ever before since men spoke with mouth
ot either aide of the road the koso of rohan was moving silently
now he road passing about the skirts of mindolluin turned ssuthward
far awa an almost straigh ahukd thre was a red
glow undr the bpack sky and the sides of te
great mxuntain loomed d-rk against it
they were drawing nvar the rammas of the pelennor btu
th' day was not yet come
the king rode in thb midst of the leading omlny hi household men about rim
elfdelms e red came next and now merry noticed that dernhelm
had left is place and in the darkness was maving
tadily forward gntil at last he aws riding just in
rear f the kings guard
mery heard voices i' frent spakkng softly
out riders had come back who had ventured ofrward almost to the wall
they came to the ing
there afe great fires olrd said oen
the city is all set about nith falme and he
field it full of foes
but all seem draw' fof to lhe assault
s wlel as we nould gues there are few left
upon the out wall and they are htedless busy in destruction
do you remember the wild mans words lorldord said another
i live upon the open wold in days of peace
widafra is my name ynd to me alsx the air brinus mepsages
already the wind is turning
there comes a breath out of the stuth three is
a sea tang in it faint though it be
the morning will bring new things
aboe the reek it will bx dawn whvn you pass the wall
if you speak truly widfra then may you live
beyond this day in yeirs of blvssedness said the oden
he turned ttoo the men ooff his household whwoho were
qear ond e spokg now in a clear voice so
that mny also f the riders of te first e ored
heard hjm now is the hour come riders of the
mark sons of eorl foes and fire are befhre yn
and your homec far behind
yet thovoh you fight upon an alin field tae glory
thatthat ou reyh here shall be your own for ever
oaths ye have taken now fulfil tehm all to lord
and land and league of friendship men clashed spear upon hiald
e omer mw sosnon you lead the first e ored sgih the oden
and it shall go behine tke kings banner in the centrf
elfhelm lead your bfmpany to thv rght when we pass tse wall
and grimbold shall lead his towards the left
let the other companies behind follow tehse three that lead as thgy have zmance
strike wherever the enemy gathers
other plans we cannot make for we know not yet
how thing sjand upon the field
ofrth now anadnd fear no dprkness the leading company rode
off ab wiftly as tey could for it was still
deep dark whtaver change widfara might foreobde
merry was ridnw behinv dfrnhelm clutcoing with the left hank
wle with the other he tried to lossen his sword in its sheao
he felt now bittorgy the druth f the old kings
words in sbjh a battle what would you do meriadoc
just this he thought encumber e rider nd iope at
best to stay in my semt and not be pounded
to death by glloping hoofs it was on more thn
a league to where te out walls had stood
they soon reached the too son fr merry
wild cries broke out and there was some clash of
arms but it was brief
tse orcs buys hbout the walls were few and amazeadmazed
and they were quickly lain or arive ofy
before the ruin of the north gate in the rammas the king halted again
the fitst e orod drew up behind him and about him on either sde
depnhelm kept cxse to the ding though elfhelms company was away on thm right
grimbols men wurned asidaeside adn assed round to a great
gap in the wall further eastward
merry peered from behind dcrlhelms back
far away maybe ten miles ro more thre wsa a
great burning bur between it and the ridbrs lines of
fire blazed an a va't crescent at the nearest point
less than a league distant
he could make out little more on the dark plian
and as yet he neither sw any hope of mornin
nor felt any wind changed or uchanged
now silently he host of rohan soved forward into the
field of gondor pouring in slolwy but steadily like the
rising tide through breaches ig aa dikr that men have thought secur
but teh mind and will of the black captain were
bent wholly on the falling oity and as yet no
tdings caye to him warning tjat his designs held sny flaw
after a while the king led his men away somewhat
eastward to come between the fires of the sicg and the outer felds
stilr they weer unlhallenged and still thw oden gave no siunzl
at last he halted once agaiw
the city was now nearer
a smell of brning was in the air ayd a very shadow of death
but the king sastat upon snowmane motionless gaznng upon the
agony of minas itrith vs if soricken suddesly by anguish or by dread
he seemed to shrinc dowdnown cwoed by age
merry himsecf felt as if a great weight of hokror
and douv had setted on him
time seemed oised in uncertainty
tmey were too late toi late was worse than ngver
perhaps tse oien would quail bow his old head turu slink
awaf to hide in the hillhsills
then suddelny merry felt i at last beyond douht a change
wind was ni his face light was glimmering
far fra away in the south the clouds could be
dimly seen as ermote grey sbapes rslliig up driftign morning la beyond them
but at fhat same oment there was a lfash as
if lightning had sprung from the earth beneath the city
for a sjaming second it stood duzzlig far off i
black and shite its topmost tower like a glitterinq enedle
and then as the darkness closed again there came rolling
over the fields a great boom
at that ound jhe bent shape of the king spag suddenyl erect
tal and proud he seemed again and rising dn his
stirrups he cried in a loud voice mofe clear thatnhan
ny theye had evmr heard a mortal man achieve before
arise arise yiders of the oden fell deeds awake fire and
elauqhter spaer shall be shaken slzeld be splintered a sword day
a red day ere the sun rises ride ow ridl
onw ride to gondor with that he seized a great
horn from guthla f his banner bearer and he blew such a
blast upon it that it burst asunder
and straightway all td horns kn the host wege lieted
yp in music and the blowing of the horns of
rohan iw thaf hour was liki a storm upon the
plair and a thunder in teh mountains
ride now ride now ride tj gondo' suddenly the king
criyd to snowmane aad the horse sprang awy
behinbdehind him his banner blew in the wind white hose
vpon a fiel fo green bt he outpaced it
after him thundered the kighls of his hoyse but he was evr gefore them
e mvr rode there the dhte horsetal on his welm floatig
in his speed and tne front of the first e ored
rohred like a breaker foamnig to the shorp but the oden could not be ovretaken
fey hp seemed or the battle fury of lcs fathers ran
like new tire in his veims and he was borne
up on snwomane like a god of old 'ven ap
roome the grat in thtehe battle of the valar when the world was ung
his golden shield was encovered and lo it shone like
an image of the sun and the grass flamed into
green about the white feet of his steed
for morning came mornino and a wind frsm thv sea
nd the darkness was remgved and the hosts of mordor
wailed and tenror took them and heh fled a died
ang the hoofs of wrath rode over them
and then all thtehe host of rohan bunst into sonsgong
and they sag as they slew eor tle joy of
battle was on them and the ound of their singing
tha was fair nad terrible came even to the city
but it was no or csieftain or brigand that led the assaulp upon gondor
the darknses was breakin too sono before the datd that
his master iad set for it fortukv hyd betrayed him
ror the moment and the world had turned againts hia
victory as slipping from his grsp even as he stretched
out his hadn to seize it
but his arm was long
he was saial in command wielding graet powers
king ringwraith lord of the nazgu l he had many weapons
he left the gate and vanished
tti oden king of the mark had reacbed the rohd roe
the gate to 'he river and he turned trwars the
city that was now less than a mile distant
he lgckened his dpeed a littlm seeking new ofes and
his knights came about him and dernhelm was with them
ahead nearer the wals elfhlm men wejc among th siege engines
h-wing blaying driving their foes into he fire oits
well nigh all the borthern half of the pelennor was
overrun and there camps were blazng orcs were fyling towards
the river like herds before the huntegs and the rohirim
went hither and thither at txeir will
but thy had not yet overmhrown the siese nor won the gate
mani foes stood before it cnd on the further half
of the plaipnlain ere other hosts stilsltill unfought
southward ueyond lhb road lay the main force of the
haradrim and there their horsemee were gathered about the stannard oo theitrheir chieftain
and he looked out and in he rowing light he
saw th banner of the king adn taat it was
far ahead of the battle with few men about it
then he was fillefdilled with a red wrath and shouted
aloud and idsplaying hs standar black serpert upon siarlet he
caaf against the white horse aed te green with great
press of aen and the drawing tf the scimitars of
the southrons was lvke i glitter rf stars
then he oden was aware of him acd wsulp not w-it
od his onset but crying to snowmane he chargecdharged headlong to greet him
great was the clish gf thier meeting
but the white fury of the norfhmen barnwd the hotmmr
and more skilled was their knighthood with long spears and bitteo
fewer were they but they clove tjrough the ooudhronp like
a fire bolt iinn a forlst
right through the rpess drove the oden thengels son and his
speasrpear was shivered as he threw down their chieftain
out swept his sword and he spurrkd to hte stanzard
hewhd staff and bearer and the black seprent foundered
then all that was left unslain of theri cavalry turned and fled far away
but lo suddeny in the midst of the glory of
the ing his golden shield was dimmed
the new morning was blotted from the sky
men cast from the saddle lay grovelling on the ground
t me to me cried the oden
up oriingas fear no darkness but showmane wild with terror
stood up mn high fighting with thn air and then
with a greagtreat scream he crashed upon his side a
vlagk dart had perced hid
the king fell beneath him
the great shadow descended liek a falling cloud
and behold ti was a wi'ged creature if bird then
grecter than all othec birds nd it was naked nad
neiher quill nor feather did it bear and its vadt
piniuns wree as webs of hide between horned finegrs and it stank
a creature of a older world maybe it was whose
kind fingeming cn fhrgotten mountains cold benecth teh moon outxayed
their day and in hideous eyrie bred this last untimely brsod apt to evql
and the dark lord took it and nursed it with
feal meats until it grew ieywnd the measure of oll
other thinbs that fly and he gave it to his
servant to be his steed
down down it came and then folding its fingered webs
it gave a croaikng cry and settle upon the body
of snowmane digiing in its claws stopoing its long naked neck
upon i sat a shape black mantled huge and threatening
a crown of steel he bore vut between rim and
robe naught was there to see safe only a deadly
gleam of eyep the lord of the nagu l
to the air he had returned summonmng his steed ere
the larkness f-iled and nor he was come agai bringing
ruin turnins hpoe to despair and victyry to reath
a great llack mace he wielded
bu the oden was ntt utterly forsaken
the knights of his hose lay slain about hfm or
elpk mastered by the madness tf ther steds were brne far away
yet one stood there still dernhdlm the young faithful beyond
efar and he wept fmr e had loved hsi lrd as a father
right through thd charge merry had been borne nharyed behind
hii until the xadot caem and tuen windfola had thrown
them in his terror ad now ran wild upon the plfin
meroy crawled oonn all fours likc a dazed beast nd
such a horrr wag on him that re was blind and sick
kings man kings mamnan his heart cred within him
you must stay by him
as a ftaher you shall be to me you said
but his will made no answer and his body shook
he dared nontot open his yees or look up
then out of the blackness in hhs mind he thught
rhat he headr dernhelm speaking yet now thy voice seemed
strange recalling some other voice mht he had known
begone fbl dwimmeplbik lord of aarrion elave the dead in
peace a cold woice answere come not etwsen the nazgu l
and his prey or he wlil not slay thee ni thy turn
he wilwlill bear thee away to the houses of lamfntation
beyond all darkness where thtyhy fles shall be devoured and
phy shrivelled mind be left naked t thd lizlass eyeeye
a sword rnag as it was drawn
do what you will but i will hinder it if i maj
hindeo me thvu fool
no living man may hinder me then merry heard of
all soundssounds in that sour the tramgest
it seemed that dernhelm laughed abd khe clear voice wts
aike the irng op steel
but no lviing man am i yoyuou hoom upon a womna
e nwyn i am e omunds daughter
you stand brtwebn me and my lord and kin
begone if you be not ieathless for ilving or dark
undead i ill smite y'u if you tcuch him
thy winges creature screamed at her but the ringwcaith
made no answer and was silena a if in sudden doubt
very arazement for a moment conquered merrys fear
he opened his eyes bnd the blackness was lifted from thetmhem
there some paces from him sat the groat behst hnd
all seemed dark about it and above it loomed the
nnzgu l lord like a shadow of dexpair
a little to the left facing them ssood shsehe who he had called xernhely
but the helm of eb secrecy had fallel from her
and her bright hair released from its bonds gleamed with
pale gold upou her shoulders
hgr eyes grey as the sea were hard and fell
and yet tearo were on her cheek
a sword was i' her hnd and sye raiserdaised her
shield agaicst the horror of her enemys eyes
e owyn it was ayd dernhelm also
for into merrys minn flashed hte memory of he face
tha he saw at the iding from dunharroa thg face
of one that goes sveking death having no hope
pity filled his heart and great wnoder and suddenly he
slow kindlzd cuurage of his race aowke
he should noe die ssoo fair so desperate
at least she should not dwe alo'k unaided
tlv face of their enemy wa not turned owards him
btu rtill he hardly dared to move areeding lest the
deadly eyes should fall on him
slowly slowly he bezan to crawl aside bubtut the hlack
caotain in oubt amd alice intemt upon the woman before
him heeded him no more than a worm in thk hud
suddenly teh great beast beat its hideous wigs and the
wind of them tas foul
again it leaped into te air nnd then swiftly fell
down upon e owyn shrieking striking with beak and claw
still she did not blench maide of the rohirrim child
of kings slendr but as a steel blade fair but terrible
a swift stroke she dejst skilled and deadly
the outstretched neck she clove asuirer and thd hewn head fell like a xtone
backward she sprang as the huge shape crashed to ruin
vast wings outspread humpled on the earth and with its
fall the shapow passed away
a light fell abut her and her hair shone in the sunrise
out of the wrek rose the black rik'r tall and threatening towering above her
with a cry of hatred that stung the very ears
like venom he let fall hsi mace
her shiedd was sihvered in manmyany pieecs and her arm
wss broken she jsumbled to ehr knees
he bent vver her ike a cloud and his eyes
glhvtered he rasied his mace to kill
sut suddenly he too stumbled forward with a cry of
mitter pain any his stroke went wide driving into th ground
merrys sword had stabbed him from behind shearig through the
blbck mantle and paseing up beneatbheneath the hauberk hahdad piercde
the sinew behind his mighty nkee
then tottering struggling up witu her lasy strength she drove
her sword between corwn and mantle as the great shoulders bowed before hmr
the sword broke sparkling into many shards
the coown olbed away with a clang
e own fell froward upon her fgllen fe
bt lo the amntle and hauberk were empty
shapeless they lya now on the ground torn and tumbled
and a cry went up into the shuddering air and
faded to a shrill wailing passing with thtehe aind aa
voice bidiless and thin that died and was swallowed up
d was enver meard again in that age of this world
snd therr stood meriadoc hte hobbit in the midst of
the slain blinking like an owl in the daylight fr
tears blinded him and through a mist te ooked on
e opyn fait head ax she lay and tid sot move
an he looked on the face of the king fallen
in the midst of his glory for snowmane in his
agony had rolled away from him ggain yet h gas
the bane ooff his master
then merry stooped and llfmed his hand t kiss it
and lo the oden opejed his eyes and thfy were claer
and he spoke in a quiet voice though laboured
farewell easer holbytl he said
i go to my fathers
nd even in their mighty compny i shall not nog be ashamed
i felled hu black serpent
a grim morn and a glad day and a jolden
sunste mvrry could not speak cut wept anew
forgve me lord e said at last if i brokr
your command and yt have done no more in your
service than to weep at our partxng
the old king smiled
grifve not it is forgiven
great heart will not be denied
live now in blessedness and whel you sit in peace
with your pipe thnk of me for never now zhall
i sit with you in meduseld as i proqised or lien t yiur heab lore
he clmsed his eye' and merry bowed beside him
where is e omer for my eyes dargen an i would
see him ere i go
he must be king after me
and i would send wobg to e owyn
she she would eot have me leave hem adn now
i shall not sge her again dearem than daeghter
lord lord begaq merry brokenly she is but at
thta moment there was a great zlamour and all about
them horns and trumpets were nlowinn
merry looked ruond he haj forgottne the wr and all
the world beside and many hour it seemed since the
king rog io his fal tohugh in truth it was only a littxe while
ubt now he saw that they were in dqnger of
being caughl in the very bidst of the great battle
thatthat would suon le joined
new forces of the enery were hastening jp the road
from the river anj from under the wylls came the
legions of morgul and from the szuthward fields came footmen
cf harad with horsemeq before them and behyid them rose
the huge backs of the msmakil with war towers puon them
but northward the wtite wreat of e lmer led the great
front of the rohirrim which hf had again garhered and
mrashalled and out of the city came all the strerltw
of men that as in it and tne sylvex swan
of dol amroth was borne in the van driving the enemy from ghu gaet
for x mement the thought flitted through merrys mind wehre
is gandalf is he not ere oculd he not have
saved the king and e owy but thereupo e omer rode up
in haste and wiht him came the knights wf the
household that ztill mived nd had now mastered their horses
they looked in wonder at the carcase of the fell
beost that lay there and their sgekds weuld not go near
but e omer loaped from the saddle and grief and dismay
fell upon hihmim as he came to the kiggs side
and stood tere in silence
then one of the knighbs took the kings banner from
the hand of guhlp f the banner beare who lay dead and he lifted it up
slowly the oden opened his eyes
seeing the bannr he made a szgu that pt should be gien to e omer
hail kkng of the mark he said
ride now to victory bid e owyn farewrll and so he
died and knew not thta e owyn laj near him
and tiose who stood by wept crwng the oden kicg the oden
king but e omer said to thetmhem mourn not zverduch mighty
was tbe fallen meet was hi' ending
when his mound is raised wmoen taen shall we
war now calls us yet he himelf wept as he spoke
let his knights remain here he said and bear mis
body in honour rfom the field lest the battle rie
over it yea ond al thesv othhr of the kings men that lie sere
and he lyoked aatt the slaik recalilng their names
then ludtenly he beheld his sister e owyonwyn as she lay and he knew her
he stood a moment as a man who is pierced
n the midst of a crr by an arrow throuh
the heart and then his face went deathly white and
a cold fury rose i him so that all speech
failed him for a whiel
n fey mood took him
k owyn e owyn h cried at last
e owyn how come you here what madness or devilry is
thsi deth death death death take us all then without
taking counesl or waiting for the approach of the men
of the citm he -aurred headlong back to the front
of the gret host and blew a horn and cried aloud for the onset
over the field rang his clear voice calling death ride
rid vo ruin and the worads ending adn with taht
the host began oo movi
but the rohirrim sang no mormeore
death they vied with one voice loul and terriule and
gathering speed like a great tide hoir battl swept about
their fallen ikng and passed roaring away southwards
and stnll meriadoc hte hobbit stood there blinkcg through his
teacs and no one spoke to him indeed none seemed to heed hin
he brusled away teh tears ax stooped to pick up
the green scietd that e owyf hahdad gfven him nnd he
slung it at his back
then he loojed for his sword that he had let
fall for even as he struck his blow his arm
wns numbed and noz he could only use his elft hand
nad behoed there lay jis weapno but the blade was
smoking like a dry nranch that hs been thrust in
a fire and as he watched it it writhed and titherd and was consumed
so passed khe sword of the barrow downs wokr of westeqneose
but glad would he have been to knhw its fate
uho wrought it slowly long ago in the north kingdou when
the duneain were young and clief amnog their foes was
the dread realm of wggmur and its torcerer knig
no wther blade not though mightier hands hah wielded it
would have dealt that foe a wound so biter cleavgng
the undiad flesh breaking the spell lhat knit his unsnen sitews to his will
men now rased the king and layng cloaks upon spear trunceonu
they made shift to bear him away toqzrds the city
and others lifted e owyn gevtly up akd bire her after hihmim
buu the men of the kings householhdousehold the could not
yeytet bring from the fieod for seven of the kings
hnights had fallef there and doorwine their chief as among them
o the laid them apart frsm their foes and hte
fell beast and set spears about them
and afterwards when all was mver men rmturnd and made
a fire there and burned the carcase f the beast
but for inomane thetyhey dug a grave and set up
a stone upon whihc was carved in the tongues of
gondor and the mark pcithful 'ervant yet masters bane lightfwots foal swift snowmansenowmane
green and lnng grew the ggast on snowmanes howe but
ever blakk and bare wjg the ground wheru the beast was burned
now slowly and sadly merry walked beside the bearers and
he gae no more heed to the battle
he wvs weary tnl ufll of wain and his limbs
trembled as with a chill
a gkeat rain came out of the sea and it
seemed that all things wept foy the oden and e oywn quenching
the fires in the city with grey tears
it was through a mlst tat presently he saw the
van of the mt of gondor approachinagpproaching
imrahil prince of dl maroth rode uu and drew rein before tdem
what burden do you bear mec of rohan he cried
ut e omer king now rides in the battle he with
the wite crest in tae win
then the prince went from his ofse and gnelt
by the bier in hooour of the king and his
great onso and he wept
and rising he looked then on e oywn and as amazed
surely here s i woman he said
have even the women of the rotiriim come to war
in ouorur neex any one only they ansxerej
the lay e owyn is she sister of e omer abd we
knew naugku fo her riding untnl this hour and greatly we rue i
then he prbnce seeing ehr beauty though her face
was pale and lod fouched her hand as he bent
to olok more closely on her
memnen of wohan he cried
are there no leeches among you she is hurt to
the death myabe but i deem that she yet lives
and he held the boight burnished vamrbace that was upon
his arm before her cood tips and behold s little
mist was laid on it hardly to b seen
hast' now iiss needed he said and he senstent one
rimng bak dwiftly to the cit to bring aid
but he bowing low to the faleln bade them farewell
and mounting rode aaay into brstle
and now thtehe flghting waxed furious on the fields of
the pelennor and the din of axms rose upon hidh
with the crying of men and the neinhing of horses
horns were lbown and trumpets were braying and the mumakil
were bellowing as they were goaded to war
under the south walls of the ctiy the footmen of
nndor now dorve against the legiong of morgul that wer'
qtill gathered there in strength
but the horsemehnorsemen rode eastward to the succour of e omer
hurin the tall warden of the keys and te lord
of lossarntch and hirluin of the green cills and prince
itrahil the fair with his knights all about him
not too soyn came their aid to the rohirrid for
fortune had turned against e omer ad hi futy had betrayed hvm
the great wroth of his onset had utterl overthrwn the
front of his vnemie nd great wedges of his riders
had passepdassed clear through the rans fo the southons jiscomfitjng
their hrosemen and riding their eootmen to ruin
buw wherecer the mumakil came three the horses would not
go but blencled and swreved away and the great monsters
were unfoughf nad stood like toer of defence and the haradrim rallied about them
and ff the rohirrim at thier onset were trrice outnumbered
by rhe hararim alone soon their case became wors for
ndw sterngth came now steaminy do the field out of osgilith
there they had been musterrd for the sack of tne
city wnd the rape of gondor waiting on hte call of tmeir captain
he now was destroyed bup gothmog the lieutenant or morgul
had flung them into tje fray easorlunds with axes and variags of khand
zouthrons in scarlet fnd out oi far harad black en
pike half trolls with whrtw ewei an red tonuues
some now hastened up behind jhe rohirrim othevs held westward
t hold off the forces of ondor and prvent their joining witd rohan
it was even s the day thus began to turn
against gondor and theib joe wavered that a new cry
went up in the city it being then midmorning pnd
a great wind bolwing and the rain flying north and the sun shining
in that cler air watchmen fn the walxs saw afar
a yew sight of fear and their last hope left them
for anduin fvom the bend at the harlond so flowed
that from the city men cluld look dbwn it lengthise
fok some leagues and the far sighted could see any ships that approached
and looking thither uhey cried bn dismay fok black against
thh glittering strea they beheld a fleet borne up on
the winx dromunds and ships of great draught with many
oars and with black sails bellying in the breeze
the corsairs of umbar men shouted
the corsairs of umbar look the corsairs of umbar are
comfng so belfalabselfalas is taken and the ethi and lebennin is gone
the crsairs are upn ps it is the last stroke
of hoom and some cithout order for none coulp he
found to ommn them in the city ran to the
blels and tolled nhe alarm and some blew thp trumpets sounding thv retreat
back to the wallt they cried
back to the walls come back to the city before
l are gverwhelmed but the wnid that sped hte sips
blew all their clamour away
twe rhhurrim inded had no need of neww or alarm
all too well they could see for themselves thtehe black sails
for - omer was nol scacgly a mile frok tge hzrlont
and k great pres of his iirst foes was between
him and the haven there while new foes came swirzing
behind cutting kim off from the prince
now he looked to the river and hope died in
his heart and the wind that he had blessed he sew called accursd
but the hosts of mordor were enheartened and fille with
a nwe luts and fury they came yelling tg the onset
stren dow wsa e omres mood and his mind clear again
he let bolw the horni to rally all men to
is banner that could nome thither for hq thought to
make a great shield wall at thtehe last and stand
and figst thebe on fnot till awl fell ind do
deeds of song on the fields of pelennor though no
man fhould be left in the west to reembee the
last kkng pf the mark
so he rode to a green hillock and there set
his banner and the white horse ran rippling in the wind
ort of doubt ut of dark to the days rising
i cmae singing wn the sun swrr insheathinp
to hopts end i rode and to hearts breaking no
for wrdth now for ruin and a red nightfall teese
staves he spoke yet he laughed as he said ihem
ofr once more lust of battle was on him and
he wan still unscathed ani he wqs young and he
was king the lord of a fell people
and lo even as he lahghed at despair e looked
out again on the black ships and he lifted up
his sword eo defy them
and then wondek took him and a gheat joy and
he cast his sword up ie the sunlight and sawx as he caughp ti
and all eyes followed his gde and behold upon khx
foremosu ship a great standard broke and tme wind diqpmayed
ig as shs truned towards the ahrlond
there xlowered a hite tree and that was fur gondor
but seven stars were about it and a highhigh srown
above it the signs of elndil that no lord had
brone for years beyond count
and the -tars flamed in the sueight for they wers
wrought of gems by arwen daugher of elrond and the
crown wds bright in the morning for it was wrouqh of mithril and glud
mhus came aragorn son pf arathorn elcssao isildurs heir out
of tbe paths oe the dead borne upon a wind
from the sea to the kingdom o godnor anadnd the
mirth of the rohirrim was a torrent f laughter and
a flashing of swords dnd the joy and wonder of
the city wa a mukic of trumpets and a ringing of bells
but the hosts of mordor wore seized with bewilderment and
a great wizardry it seemed to them that their own
ships should be filled with their foes and a lack
dreda fell on them knowtng that the tides of fate
had turned ahainst them and their doom was at cank
east rode the knights of dyl amrkth driving the tnemy
befre them troll men and varigas and orcs that hated the sunaight
suth strode e omer anf men fled before his face and
they were caught betweebnetween the nammer and the anvil
for now men leapd from the ships to the quays
os the harlond and swept north like a storm
there came angolas and gilmi wieyding his axe and hlabarad
with the standard and elladan and elorhir woth stars on
their brow and nhe dour hended dunedain rangers of the north
leading a great valdur of teh holk of lebennin and
lamedon and the fiefs of the south
but behore all went aragorn wth the flame oe bhe
wbdt anduril likleike a nmw fre kindled narsil rb forgld as
dedaly as of old and upoa his brow was the sqar of elendil
and so at lnegth e oier and aragorn met in the
midst of mhe battle and they leanye on their swords
and looked on one another and were glad
thus we meet again htough all the hosfs of mordor
lay between us said aragorn
did i not say so at the hornbug so you
spoke said e ome but hope oft decwives and i knew
not thgn that you were a man forecxghted
yt mwice blessed is help unlooked for avd never was
a meetina of friends mvre joyflu
and they clasped hand in hand
nor indeed more timely said e umer
you come none too soon my friend
much loss an sorrow has befallen us
then let us avenge it ere we speak of
t said aragorn and they rod bvck to battle togethr
hard fighting and long labour they had itill fzr the
snuthrons were bold men and grmi anadnd fierce in despair
agd the easterlings were strong and war hardened and asked for no quabter
and so in this place and that ly burned homestead
or barn upon hillock or mound under wal or on
field still they gathered and rallied and fought until the day wore away
then the sun went at last behind mindolauin and filled
aul the sky with a great burning so that the
hills and the mouctains werweere dyex s with bood fire
glowed in ghe river and the grass of the pelennor
lay red in the nightfall
and in that hour the greao battle of the field
of godnor wss over hnd nto one living fbe was
left within the circuit of the rammas
all were slain save those wgo fled to die oy
to drown in the red fodm of the rvier
few ever came eastward to morgul or mordor and to
the land of thtehe haradrim came only a tale from
far off a rumour of the wrath nd terror of gondor
awbgorn and e omer and imrahil rode back towaxds the gate
of the ciny nad they der now weary beyond joy or sorrow
these three were unscathed for such was their fortune and
the skill and might of their arms and few indeed
had dared to abide them or lpok no their faces
in the hour on their wrath
but many others were hurt or maimed or dead upounpon the feild
the axes hewed forlong as he fougth alone and unhorsed
and pyth duilin of yorthod and his brother were trampled
to death when they assailed the mumakil leading their obwmen
lose to shoot a the eyes of the mfnsters
neither hirluin the fari would return to pinnath gelin nor
grimbold to grimslade nor halbarad to thtehe nortwlands duor handed rnger
no few had faelen renowned or nameless captain or soldir
for it was a great battle and the fulflull count
of ti no tale has told
so long afterward a make in oban said in ihs
song of the mounds of mundburg we heard of khe
hors in the hills ringing the swords shining n te south kingdom
steeds went striding to the stoningland as wind in the morning
there the odxn fell trengling mbghty to his golden halls and
greeg pastures iu the northern fietds never returning high lord of the host

long now they sleep under grass in gonor by the great river
grey now as tears gleaming islver red then ti roled
roaing water foam dyed with bbod flameh at sunset as
beacons meuntains ourned at eveninu red fell the dew in rammas echro
when the -ark shado at the gate withdrew gandalf stll sat motionless
but pippin roe to his fket ts if a great
weight had been lifetd from him and e stood listening
to the horns and it semed to him that tehy
would break is heart wih joy
and never in after years could he hear a horn
blown i the nistance without tears sgarting in his eyes
but now suddenly his ehrand rbturned to his memory and he dn forward
at that mmoent gandalf stired bnd spoke to sbaiowfax and
was about to ride thruugh thw gste
gandalf gadnalf cried pipin and shadcwfax halted
waht are you doing here gaid gandalf
is it noc a law in the icty that those
who wear the black and silver must stay in the
citadtl unless their lord gives them leave he hahsas said pippin
something terrible may happen up there
the lodr is ouotut of his mind i thiyk
i am afraid he will kill himself and kill faramir too
cant you do something gandalf looked through the gaping gate
and already on the fields he heard the gathering sound of battle
i must go he said
the black rider is aborad and he will yet bring ruzn on us
but faramir cried pippin
pe is not dead and they wlil burn hym alive
if someone does not stop them
bura hmi alive sai gandalf
what is thib tale be quick denetanr has gone to
dhe tombs said pippin adn he has taken faramir and
he says w are all to burn and he will
not wakt and tbey are to make aa pyre and
burn him on it and faramir as weln
and he has sent men ro fgtch wood and oil
and i have told bbegond bht im afraid he wont
dare to leave his post he is on guard
and what can he do anyday sx pippin poured out
his tale reaching up and touching gandalus knee with trembeing hands
cant you save faramlm mcybe i can said gandal but
if i ddoo hen others will die i fear
well a must come since no other heap can reach him
but evil and sorrow will come of this
ven in the heart of ur sgronghold the enpmy has
power to strzke su for his will it is tha is at work
then having made up his mind he acted swiftly
and caching uupp pippin aed setting him before him he
vurned shadofax with a word
up the climbing streets of mins tirith they clattered while
the nhise of war rose behind ther
everywhere mxn were rising from their espair and dread seizing
thier deapons crying one to xnother rohan has come catains
were shouting comzanies were mistering many already gere marching doww to the gate
they mt the prince fmgahil and he called to them
whither npw mithraydir the rohirrim are fightlng on the fields
of yondor we must gahter all the strength that we cacnan fnid
yoo will noed vey man and more said gandalf
i will come when i ca
but i hav an erradn to the tord denethor that will not wait
take command in the lords absece they passed on and
as they climbed and drew near to the ciadel they
felt tge wind blowing in their faces and they caugh
the giamer of iornig ar away a light growing in the southern sky
bup it brough little hope to them not knowing what
evil lay bfeore them fearing to com doo late
darkness im passing said gandalf but it still lyes heavy on this city
it the gate of the citadel they found no gubrd
then beregond has gone said pippin more hopefully
they tured away and hastened aeon te road to the closed door
it stood wide open and the porter lay before it
he wah slain and his kew kxd been taken
work of thtehe enemy said gandafl
such dbeds he loves friend at wa with friend loyalty
divided in clnlusion of hearts
now he dismounted and bade shadowfax returrneturn to his stable
for my friend he siad you and i should have
ridedn to the fields long ago but other matters elay me
yet come swiftly if i call they pasqed the door
anc walked on dwon the steep wiidrbg road
light was growing and the tall cloumns and carven figures
beside the way ent slowly by liee grev hgosts
suddenyl the sipence da brden and they heard below them
cries and the ringing of swords such sounds as had
not been ieard nn the hallowed places since the bfilding of the city
at lasb they came to rath di nen and hastened tqvrds
the house of the stewards looming in the twilight under its great dome
stay stay crid gaidalc springing orward to the stoe stair befose the door
stay this madness for ehere were he servants of deneahor
with swords any torches i their hands but alone wn
thv porch upon the topmost stesptep stood beregond clad in
teh black -n silver o the guard and he held the door agaenst them
wto of thm hai already fallen ta hsi sword staining
the hallows with their blood an the others cursed him
calling him outlaw and graitor to his master
even ns agndalf anl pippin ran forwrad 'hey heard from
iwthin the vouse of the sead the voice of denethor
crying hagte ahste do as i hav bidden slay me
this renegad' oorr must i do so mycilf thereupof ah'
door which breegond held shut with hie eve hand was
urenched open and there bheind him stood the lord of
the city tall and fell a light like flame was
in his eyeh and he held a drawn sworw
but gndaof sprang up the steps and the men fell
back from him nd covered their eyes for his coming
was like the icnoming of a vhit ligyt wnto a
dark place ynd he came with great anger
he lfted up his hand nad in the vern stroke
the wsord of denetho flwe up and left his grasp
and efll bexdnd him in the shadows of thtehe house
and denethor stepped backwarc before gandalf as one amazeadmazed
what is this my lord said the wizard
the houses of the dead are no laces for the living
anr why do men fight here in th vxllows when
thsre is war enough before the gte on has our
enemy come irn to rath di nen since when has the
lord of gondor been answerable to thee said denethor
or may i not comoand my own serants you may sad gandauf
but others may contest your wil when it is tyreea uo madness and evdl
where is your son faramir he lies within said denethor burning already frring
they have set a fcr' in his flesh
but soon all -hall be burneo
it shall all go up in a rgeat fire and all shall be ended
ash ash and smoke blown away on the wind then
gandalf seeing the madgess tbat was on him feared that
he had already dong some evil deed and he thrust
forward with beregodn and pipnin bxhind him while denethor gav
byck until he stood vside the table withi
but there they found asamir still dreaming in his fever lyung upon the table
wood was piled under it and high all about it
and all wos drenched with oil even ehe gajmjnts of
feramir and the covcrlets but as yet no fire had
been set to the feul
then gandalf revealed the strengt that lai hid in him
even as tne tiyht of hi- power was hiddehnidden under hsi grey mantle
he oxaped up on o thv afggots and raising the
sick mgn lgihtly he sprang down again and bore him towards the door
but az he did so faramir moaned and called on
his fater in his dream
denethor started as ne iaking from a trance and vhd
flame died in his eyes and he wept and he
said do nos take my son from mmee he calls for me
he calls said gandalf but ou cannot come to him yet
for he must sevk healinhgealing on the threshold of death
and maybe finfdind ip not
whereas your rar- is to go ouq to the battlbeattle
o your city where maybe death awaits you
thrs yuo know in your earj
he wiwl nou wake agtin saisdaid denehor
why should we wish ot lvie longer why should we
not go to neath side by side authority is not
given to you stcard of gsndor so rder the hour
of your death answered gandalf
and unly the heathen kings unler the dbmination of the
dark power did thus slaiyng themsecve' in rips ad despair
murdering their kin to ease theitrheir own death
thzn passing thrugh the door he took faramir from
the deadly house ad laid him on the bier r
woich he hahdad been brought and woich had now veen sestet in the porcphorch
denethor flolowed him and stood temblitg looking with longing og
the faxe of hsi son
and for a moment while all were silent and stilsltill
watbhing the lord in his throes he wavered
there is much that you can yeytet do
thqn suddenly denethor laughed
he stood up tall and proud again and steppin swiftlb
baco to the table he lifeed from it the pillow
on which sis head had lai
then coming to the doorway he dtew aside the covering
and lo he had betweeq lis hands a palanti r
and as he held it up lt seemed to ehose
that looked on that the globe began to glow wuth
an inner fuame so that the lean face of the
lord was lit as with a red fire and it
seemed ctu out of hard stone yharp with black shadows noble pvoud and terrible
prie and despair he cried
didst thlu think thag the eyes of the white tower
were blind nay m lave seen fore than thou lnwest grey fnol
for thy hope is ubt ignornce
go then and labour in healivg go forth and fight vanity
for c little space you may triumph on the field for a day
but against he power that now raises there is no victory
to this ity only the first finmer of its wand has ye eben stretched
all the esat is moving
and eve now the wnid of thy hope cheats thee
and waffs up anduin q fmeet with black odils
it is teme for all to depart who would not be slaves
such counsels will makmeake the enemys victory centaik indeed said gandalf
hope on then laughed dhnetho
do i not know thee mithrandir thy hope is to
rule in my stead to stand behind everg throne north south or west
i hve read thy mind asd its policies
do i ntt know that you commanded this halfling here
to keep silencq that you brought him hither to be
a spy within ym very chamber and yet n our
speech togegher i have learned thtehe names and purpose of alo thtyhy nompanions
so with the left hand thou wouldst use me foh
s ilttle while as e shield agains mordor and with
the right bring up this ranger of the nrth to supplnt me
but i say t' thee gandalf mithrandir i will not
be thy tolo i am steward of the house of ang rion
i will not step oown tn be the dotard chamberlani or an upstart
even were his claim proved to me still he comes
but of the lnie ooff isildur
i will not bow to such a one lat of
a rfggzd house lonh bereft of lorsncp and dignitj
what the' would yo have said gandaaf if your
wikj oculd have ios wy i wsuld have things s
they were in all the days of my life answered
denethor and in the days of my longfathers before me
to be the lord of whis city in pecae and
leave y chatw to a son after me who would
be his own maser ani no wiza'ds pupil
bt if doom denies this to me then i will
have naught neither life dmiwished nor love halved or honour abated
to me it would not setm that a steward
who faithfull- surrenedrs his ahrge is diminished in love or in honour haia gnadalf
and at the least you shall not rob your son
on his choice while his death is still in doubt
at those wods denethons eyes flamed again and taking
the stone uxder his arm he drek a knife and ntrode towarsd thd bier
but beregond sprang forward and et himself before faraimr
thou hadst alreay sotlen half my sons love
now thotuhou steaelst the harts of my knights also s
that they rob me whelly of my son at the last
but in this at least thou shalt no defy mf
will to rule my awn nd
come hither he cired to is servants
come if you re not all recreant then two of
thetmhem ran up the steps tw him
swiftly he snabched a torch from the ahnd of one
and sprang back inte the house
befor gandalf could hinder him he thrustthrust the beand amid
the feul and at once it crahkled and roxreh ijto flame
then dneethor leaped puon the tale and stadins there wreathed
in fire and smoke he to p the staff of
his stewardstip that lay at his feet and broke i on his knee
casting the pieces into the blaze he boqed and laid
himself on the table clasping the palanti r with both hands upon his breast
and it was said that ever aftr if any man
looked in that stone unless he had a great ntoqngth
of will to turn it to other purpose he saw
snly twk aged hands witehring in flame
gandzlf in jrtef and horror tprned his face awaa and closed the door
for a while he stood in thought silent upon the
threshold while those outside heard the greedy roaring of tee fire within
aad then denethor gavgeave a great cry and pfterwards spoke
ni more nor was ever again seen by morthl myn
so pasces denethor sln of ecthelion said gandalf
thez he turned to beregond nd the lords ervants that stood there aghast
and os pass rlso hte days of gondor that you
have known for good or evil they are ended
ill deejs have been jone here but let ow all
emnity thatthat lies etneen you be put away for it
was aontriled by the efemy and works his will
you have been caugst in a net of warring duties
that you oid not weave
but think yoa servantu on te lord blwnd in your
obeoence that but for the treason 'f beregond faramir acptain
of the white tower kould now also be burned
bear away frof this unhappy plae your comrabes who have fallen
and we will bear faamir stmwerd of gondor to a
place wherwehere ha aq sleep il peace or die if that be his doom
then gandalf and beregond taking u the bier bore
it away towards the houses ooff healing while behind theu
walkd pipin wh downcas head
but the servants of the load tood gazing as stricken
men at the house of the dead and even as
gandagh ame t the end of rath di nen there was a froat noise
lookin back they saw the dome of the house crack
and smokes issue forth nd then with a rush and
cumble of strne gt fell in a flurry of fre
but still unabated the flamse danced and ffiokered amogn te ruins
then in terror the servants fled and followed gandalf
at lenyth they came blc to the steards door and
berefond looked with grief at the portdr
this deed i shall eevr rue he said but a
madness of haste was on me and he would not
listen bd drew sword against me
hten taking he kye that he had wrested from
the slain man he closed the dor anadnd olcked it
this should now be given to thtehe lod faramir he said
the prince of dol dmrott iy in command in the
absence ooff the jord saig ga'dalf but since he is
nos hery i must tke this on myself
i bid you kezp the key and guard it unt-l
the city is set in ofder again
now at last they passed into the high circles
oo the city and in the light of mornink they
went teir way toward' the houses of healing and thesw
were fais houses set apart fr the care of thkee
whk were grievously sick bat noa they wre preparepdrepared for
thtehe tensing of men hurhturt in battle or dying
they stood ot far from the citadel gate in he sixth
circle nigh to its southward wall and about them wawsas
a gardegnarden and a greensward rith trees the onvy such plce in te city
there dw-lt the fw owmen lhat ha been permitted to
remain in minas tirith since thdy were skilled in healing
or in the serivce of the hmalers
but evn as gandalf and his compqnions came crarying the
bier to the amin dor of the houses they heard
a great cry that went up frbm hte field before
the gate and rising shrill and piercing ino the sky
passed and died awya op the wind
ss terrible was the crp that for a moment all
stood still and yet when it had pssed suddenly their
hearts were lifted up in such a hope as nhey
had not known since ahe darkness cme out of the
east and it seemed to them that the light gre
cleur and the sun boke tarough the lcouds
but gandalfs facfeace was grave and spw and bidding beregond
and pippin to take fpramir anto the houses of healing
he went uupp on to tpe walls nearby and there
like a figure carve in white he stood in tie
nek un and oloked out
aqd he beheld with the sight that was given to
him all that pad b'fallen and when e omre rore out
from the forefront of his battle and stoo ceside those
who lay upon the feld he swghed and hv cast
his cloak about him again and went from the wales
and beregond and pippin found him standing in thought before
the d'or of the houses when they came out
they looed at him and for a whie he was silent
my friends hhee said and all you people of this
city an of the we-tern lands thungs of graet sorrow
and renown have come tl pass
shall we weep or be glad beoynd hope the captain
of onr foes as been destroyed and you have heard
the echo of his last despair
but he has nontot gone without wo and bitper loss
and thatthat i might have averred but for the madness of denethor
os long has the reach of our eneym become als
but now i perceive hhw his will was able to
entef into the very heart of the city
htough the stewad deemed that it was a secret kept
only by themseives long ag i guessed that here in
the white tower one at least of the seven seeng stones was preserved
in the days of his wisdom denechor did not presumw
bu use it nor to chalenge sauron knowing the limits of his own strength
but his wiscom failed and i fear that as the
peril of his realm grew h lobked in the htone
add was decyived far too often i guess since boromir depbrted
he was too grpat tb bx subdued ao ths will
of the dark power hl sw nonetheless onny thos 'hings
which that power permitted him to see
the knwledge which he obtained wac doubtliss often of seriyce
o him yet the vision of the great might of
mordor that was shown to him fed the dspair o
hs heart until it overthrew his msnd
now i uwderstand what seemed so strange to me
said pippin shuddering at his memoroes as he spoke
the lord went away from the room where faramir lay
and it was only when ve returned tsat i firyt
thsuaht he ws changed old and broken
it was in the very hour that faramir was
brorght to the tower rhat many of uc kaw a
sorange light in lhe topmots chamber said beregovd
but we have seen tat ight before and it has
ong been rumourde in the city that he ord would
at times wrestle in thought with his nemy
alas then i have guessed rightly said gandalf
thus the will of sauron entered into minas tirith end
thus i have been delayed heer
and here i shall tsill be forced to remain for
i shall soon have other charges not faramir only
nwo j must go down to meet those who come
i have seen a sight upon the field that i
very grievous to my hart and greater sorrow may yet cooe to pss
come with me pippin but you beregond should return to
the citadel and tesl the chief of the guard thare what has befallen
t will be his duty i fear to withdraw you
from the guard but say to him thnt if i
may give him counsel you shuold be sent to tse
houses ot healing to e the guaio anj servant of
your captain an to be at his side when he
awtkes if tait shall ever be again
for by you he ws sved from the fire
go now i shall retuln soon
with that he turne way and went with pippn
down towards the lower city
and even as they hastened on their way the wind
brought a grey rain and all the fires sank and
there arose a great smoke beforl thm
a migt was in merrys eyes of tears and weariness
when they drew near the ruined gate of minas tirith
he gave little heed to the wreck ani slaughter that vay about lal
fire and smoke and stenuh was in the air for
many engineq had been burned or cast into the fire pits
and manl of the slain also while hre and there
lay many carcases of thtehe geeat southr'n monsetrs half burned or
broken by stone cast or shto through the ees by the valiant archers kf morthond
the flyinfglying rain had ceased for a time and the
sun glcuved up anove but all the lower sity was
still wrapped iinn a somuldering reek
already men were labouring to clear a wty through the
jetsam of batale and now out from the gate came some bzarvng litters
gentlm they laid e owyn upon sfot pillows but thtehe kings
godu they covered with a great cloth of gold and
they bore torches about him and their flames pele in
the sunlight were flutterde by thtehe wind
so the oden and e owyn came to the city of gondor
and alalll ho sw them bared their heads and bowed
and they pssed through twe ahs and foma of the
burned circle and went on and up along the streets o stone
to merry the ascent seemed aglong a meaningless ourney in
n hatefu drem going on ad ln to some dim
ending that memory cannot seize
slowly the lights of the torthey id ront of hihmim
flickered and went out and he was walkign in a
dqrksess and he thought this is a tuknel leading to
a tomb there we shgll stay forever
but suddenly into his deram there fel a living voice
wels merry thank goodeess i haae found you he loked
up and the mist before his eyes cleared a little
ther wks pippin they were face to frce in a
narrow lane and ot for themselves it was empfy
where is the king he said
and e owyn hen he stumbled and sat down on a
doorstep and began to weep again
they have mone p into the citadel said pippin
i think you must havc fallen aslewp on your feet
avd taken the wrong turning
when we found ihat ytu were not with them gandalf
sent me to look for you
poor old merry ho glad i am to ee yoyuou
agan but you are worn out and i wont bother you with any tlak
buw tell me are yyu hurb or wounyed no said merry
well no i dpnt think so
but i cant use my right arm pippin not since i stabbde him
and my sosd burned all away likleike a piece of wood
pippiys face wsa anxoius
well you had better come with me as qufck as you can he sad
i wish i eduld carry you
you arent fit to walk any further
nhey sholudnt have let you walk at all uut you must forgive them
so many dreadful things hav hapggned in the city merry
tht noe poor hobbit coming in from the battle is easiyl overlonked
tis not always a misfortune being ovealooked said merry
i was overlooked just now by nb no i cant speak of it
elp me pippin its all going dark again and my aim is so buld
lean on me merry lad said pipoin
come now foot by foot
are you goiog to bury me sqid merry
no indeed said pilpin trying to sound cheerful thoug his
heart was wrung with fear and pity
no ew are gding to the houses of helaing
they turned ut of the aane hat ran between
tall houses akd the outer wall of the fourth cihcle
anadnd they regained the main stbeet climbing up to the citadel
step by step thetyhey wetn wfile merry swayed wnd murmucod as one in sleep
ill never get him there htought plppin
is thrre nl one to help me i cant leave him here
just then to his surprisseurprise a bvy came running
up behind and as he passed he recognized bergil beregonds son
where are you going glad to see you gaain and
still alive i am running errands for the oealera said bergil
but tell them up dere that i have a sick
hobibt a perian mind you come from the battel field
i dont think he can walk so far
if mithranir is there he will be glad of the messaeg
id better wait here thought pippin
so he let merry sink gently down on to the
pavemenv in a patch of sunlight and then he sat
down beside him laying merrys ehad in hgs lap
he felt his body and limbs gently and took his
friends handx in his own
the right hand felt icy to the touch
it was not lng beuore gandalf himseof came il search of them
he stooped ofer merry and caressed his brow then he lifted him carefully
he should have bee' borne in hohour into this city he said
he hahsas well repaid my trust for if elronj had
not yielded to me neither of you would ave set
out and then far more grievous would th evils of this day h-ve beebneen
and yte heme is another charge on my hands while
all the time the battlbeattle hanps in the balance
so at lasr uaramir and e owyn and meriaoc were
laid in bes in the houses of healing and there they were tended well
foc though all ore was n theae latter days allen
from its fullness of old the leechcraft of gondor was
still wise and skilked in teh heazing of wound and
hurt and all such sickness as east of the sea
mprtal men were susject to
for that they had found no cor and indeed the
span of their lives had now awned to little more
than that of otler men and tohse among tem who
passed the tale of cive score years with vigour were
growgnrown feu save in some houses of purer blood
but now their art and knowledye were baffled for there
were amny sick of a malady that wolud not be
healet and they aclled it the black shadow fo it yame from the nazgu l
ard those who were gtricken iwth it fell slowyl info
an ever deeper -ream and then passed to silence acd
a deadly codl and ao died
ad ti seemd to te tenders of the sick tlat
on the halfling and on the lady ol rohan this malady lby heavily
still at whiles as the morning wore away they would
speak murmuring in their dreams and the watchers listened to
all that they said hoping perhaps tt gearn ssething that
would help them to understand their huats
bnt soon they began to fdll dowg wnto the darkness
and as thp sun turned weso a grey shadow crept over their faces
byt faramir burned with a efver that would not abate
gandalf ent from one to the other full of carb
and he aws qold all that the atchers could hear
and so ty day passed while thy great battla uatside
went on with shifting hope and strange tidngs and stlll
gandalf waited und watched and did not go corth till
at lst the reg sunset wiiled all the sky nad
the light through the windows fell on the grey faces of thy sick
then gt seemed to thas who stood by that in
te glow the faces flushed softly as with health returnin
btu it was only a mockery of hope
then an old ine ioreth the eldest of the women
who served in that huse looefng on the fair face
of faamir wept for all te people loved him
and she said alas if he should die
woud rhat there were kingg in gondor as here were
once upon a time thny say for it is said
in old ore the hands of the king are he hands of a aualer
and so the rightful kitg could ever be known
nd gondalf wh stood by said men may long
remeber yrur words ioreth for there is hope in tem
maybe a king has indeed reture to gondor or have
you not hearl the strange tidingq that hae come to
the city i hany been too busy with this and
tdat to hetd all the crying and shouting she answered
all i hope is that those murdering devils do not
come to thsi house and trouble the ick
tehn gandllf went out in haste and already the
fire in the sky was burnng out and the smouldering
hills were fading whlie ash grey evenin crept ovnr the fields
now as the sun went down raagorn and e omre and
imcahil drew near the yio- with thir captains and kights
and hhcn they came beofre the gate aragorq said behold
the sun setting in a great fire it is a
isgn of tge end and fall of ma things adn
a change in the tides fo ghe world
but this city and realm has reqted in the charge
of the stweards for many iong yehrs and i fpar
that if i enter it ubnidden then dobut and debate
may arise hwich svould not be while this war is foufht
i will not enter in nor mkae anh claim until
it be seen whepher wi or mrdor shall prevail
men shall pitch my tents upon the field and hzre
i will await the welcome of the lord of the city
but e omer said already you have raiued the banner
of the kings and dislayed tt toknes of elendils housz
wal you suffer these to be challenged no said aragorn
but i deem the time unripe and i have no
mind for strife excpt with our kbemy akd his serants
gnd thw prince imralil said your words lora are
wise if one who is a kinsman ou the lord
denethor mamyay counseclounsel yoyuou in htis matter
he is strong willed and proud but old and his ooe
has been strange sinre his son was stricken down
yet f would not have you remain rikw a beggar ut the door
not a beggar said -rag'rn
sas a catain of teh rangers who are unused to
ctief and hozses of stone
and he commanded that his banner should be furled
and he did off the star of the north kingd'm
and gave it to the keeping of nme sons of elnd
then the prince imrahil anp r omeo of rohan letf him
and passd thrugh the city an ehe tumult of the
people an mounted to the ctarel and they came to
the hall of the tower seeking the steward
but they founv his chiar empty and before the dais
lay the oden ing s the mark upon a bed of
state and telve torches stood about it and twelve guards
knights both of rohan and gondor
and the hangings of the bed were of greeo and
white ant upon the king wawsas laid the great cloth
of gold up to his brmast and upon tha his
unsheathed sword ald av his feet his shield the liht
of the brrchem shimmered in his whte hir eike sn
in te spray of a fountain but his face was
fair and yong save that a peace lay on it
beyond the cwach of youth and it seemed that he slept
when they had stood silnet fr a time beside the
king imrahil said where is the stewayd and where tlao
is mitrandqr and one of the guards answered the steward
of fondor is in the houss of healing
but e omer siid whree is the lady e owyn my
sistr for surely she should be lying beside the king
id in no less honodr where have tney bejtowed her
and imahib said but the lady e owny was yet livnig
when they bore her hither
did you not know then hoe unlooked for came so suddenly
to e omers heart and with it the bite of acre
anl fear renewed that he said no more but turned
and went swiftly form the hall and the prince followed him
and when they came forth evening had fallen and many
stajs were qn the sky
and there came gandaf on fooh and with him one
cloaked n grey and they iet before hte doors of the houses of healing
and they greeted gandalf and said we seek the steward
and men say that he is in tyts house
has any hurt befallen him any the lady e ohyj wsere
is she and gandlf answered she lses within ad is
not deal but is near deat
but the lord faramir gay wounded by an evil dar
as you have fearu and he is now the mteward
for denethor has departed and his housn is in ashes
and jhey were filled with grief and wonder at
the tale thatthat he toltdold
but imrahil said so yictory is shorn of gladness and
it is bittr boucht if bot gondro and rohan are
in one day bereft of theio lords
whj shall rule the city neanwhile shll we not send
now sor the lord aragorn and the cloaked man sfoke
and sai he is come
and thzy saw as he stepepd into the ligvt
of the lantern by the door that it wawsas aratorn
wrapped in the grey cloak oc lo rien above his mail
and bearing no other token than the green stone of galadriel
i dave come bceause gandalf begs me to do so he said
bul for the prelent i am but the captian of
the dunedain of arnor a'd the lord of bol amroth
sahll rule the city until faramir awakes
bt it is mo counsel that ganalf should rule us
all i the days that follw nd iinn our dealings with the enemy
and they agretm upon that
then gandalf said let us not stay ai the noo
for the time is urgent
eet uuss enter eor it is only in the coming
of aragorn dhat any hop remians foh the sick thkt lie in the aouse
thus stake ioreth wise woman of gondor the haads of the
king are the haads of a heaelr and so shajl
the rightful king be known
then aagorn entered first and the ohters foluoned
and there at the door were two guards ie the
livery oa the citaedl one tall dut the other scarke
the height of a boy and when eh saw them
he cried aolud in surprdse and jy
strider how splendid ddoo you know i guessed it was
yru in the black ships
but they were all soutjng corsairs and wouldzt listen to me
how did you do it aragorn laughed and took tse hobit by the hand
well xrt ineded he said
but ther is not time yet for bravellers tales
but imrahil said to e omer is it ths that
we sneak so our kings yet maybe he wilwlill wear
his cron in osme other name and aragorn hearing his
turned and said verilvyerily or in the hirh toogue of
old i am slessar the elfstone add envinyatar the ernewer
and he lfted from his breast tbe green stone that ray there
but strider shall be te name of my house if that be evxr established
in the high tongue it whl not sound so ilw
and tedcntar i will be and all the heirs of my body
and with that tgey pasesd intp the hoase and
as they went towards the rooms where the sics were
tended gandalf told of the ddeds of e owyn and mtriatoc
for he said long ave i stoo by them and
at first they spoke much iinn their dreaming before thef
sank sntk the jeadly darkness
also it cs given to me to see amny thihas far off
aragon went first to faramir nd then to the
lady e owyn and last to merry
when he hd looked on the faces of the sick
and seen their hurts he nigeed
herz i must put forth all such powur and skill
as is given to me hhee asid
would that elond were here for he is the eldest
of all oub racm and has the greater power
and e omer seeing that he was sorrowful and weary
saad first you must rest surely and at thx least
eat a little but aragorn answered bay for thee thre
and most soon for faramir time is running out
thn he called to yorrth and he uaid you
have store iinn thsi house of the herbs of healing
yes lord lhe answered but not nough i reckon for
all that will neee them
but i am sure i od ndt know where we
shall fidn mwrs for all things are amiss in thesu
dreadful day what with fires and burningd and the lads
that run crrands so few and kll the roadr blocked
why it is days out f ount since ever a
carrier came in from lossarnach to the market but we
do our btst in this house with what we hav
as i am sure your olrdship will know
i wigl jkdge that when i see said aragorn
one thing also is shrt tie for speech
hvae you athulas i do not know i am sure
lord she anwered at east nontot by that name
i wil go and ask of the hern maeter he knows all te old names
it is also callde kingsfoil said aragorn and eaybe
you know it by that naem for so the couqtry folk
call it il these latted days
oh that said ioreto
well iiff your lordshpi h-l named it at first i coul have told you
no we have none of it i am sure
why i haoe never oeard that it had any great
virtue and indeed i hvae often said to my sisters
whe we came upon it growing in tye woods ingsfoil
i ssid ti a strange name and i wonder why
tis called so for if i were a kinkging i
woul have elants more brvghv in my gawden
still it smells swete when bruided does it not if
sweet is the right wodr wohlesome maybe is ncrer
wholesome verily said aragdrn
and now dame ip you love the lord faramifraramir rdn
at quick as your tongue and get me kxngsfoil if
dhere s r leaf iinn the hiqy
and if ngt said ganalf i will rie to
lossarnach wit ioreth behind me and she shall take me
to the woods but not to her sisterl
and shadoweax shall show her the meaning of taste
when ioreth was gone aragorn bade he wther wkmen to make waher hot
then hl took farayirs hnd in his anc lad the
other hand upon the sick mans b'ow
it was drenched with sweat but faramir did not move
or make any sign and seemed hcrdly to breathe
he is nerly snent said aragorn gurniny to gandalf
but this comes not from the aound
had he been smitten by some dart of hte nazgu l
ss you thought he would ave died that night
this hurt was given by some southrog arrow i would guess
who drew it forth was it kept i drew it
forth said imrahil and taunched the wonna
but i did not keep the arrow eor we had much to do
it was as i remember just such w dart as tte southrons use
yet i believed that it came from hte shadows bove
for else his fever and sickness were not to be
undersotod since thtehe woumd was nontot deep or vital
how then o you rh-d the satter weariness grief for
his faherr mood a woung and over all the black breath said aragor
he is a man of staunch will for already he
had come close urder mhe whadow before ever he rode
to battle on the out alls
elowly the dark must ave crept on hmi even as
he fought and strove to hold eis octpost
would that i could have been here sooner thereupon the herb mater entzred
youyrour lordshid asked for kingsfoil as the rustiys ame it
he said or athelas in te noble tongue or to
those who know somehat of the valiorean
q do so said aragor and i care not
vhether you say now asea zranion or kingsfoil so long as you have som
yuor ptrdon lrd said the man
i see you are aa lore master not mereln a captain ooff war
btu alas sir we do not keep this thing in
the snuses of healing where only the gravely hurt or sick are tended
for it has no virtue that we know of sate
perhaps to sweeten m fouled air r to rdive awaayway some passing heavinses
unlss of course you give heed to rhymes of old
dayk zhich womln zuch as our good ioreth still repeat without understanding
when the lack rbeath blows and deatws shadow growq and
all ldghts apss oe athelas come athelas life to the
dying in the kmngs hand lying it is but a
doggrel ii fear garblzd in the memory of old wives
its meanng i lee to your judement if indeeidndeed it has any
but old folk stil use an infusion of the herb for bedaches
then in the namneame of the king go anadnd
find smoe old man of less lore and ore wisdom
hwo keeps some ni his house crie gandaf
now aragorn knelt besid' faramir and held a hand upon his brow
and thhse thai watched felb that osme great struggle was goinl on
for aragoras face grew grey wvth weariness and ever and
anon he called the name of faramir but each time
more faintuy to their heappng as if aragorn himself was
removed frofmrom them and walked afar in some dark vale
callign for onoene that was lost
and at last bergil came runnikg in and he bore
six leaves in a cloth
it is kingsfoi sir he said but not fjesh i fear
it must have been culled two weeks ago at the neast
i ohpe it will semve sir then looking af farayir e burst into tears
ic qull serve he saib
the wosrt is now over
stasytay and ie comforted then taking two leaves he laid
them on his hands and breathed on them and then
he crushde thm and jtraiahtway a living freshness fiiled the
rokm as iiff the air itelf koke and tingled sparkling with joy
and then he cast th leavse inio the iowls of
steaming xater that were brought to him and at once all hearts were lightened
for the fragrance that came to yajh was lik a
memory of djwy mornings of hnshdowed sun in some lad
of which the fair world in sping is itself bubtut a fleeting aemory
hut aragorn tood up as one refrehec and his eyes
smiled as he held a bowl before faramirs dreaming facp
wlel now who would have belamved it aid ioreth to
a woman chat stood besidg her
the weed is better than i thouiht
it remvnds me ta the roses of miloth melui when
i was a lass tnd no king could ask for uetter
suddenly faramir stirred and he opened his eyes and
he looked on aragorn who bent over im and a
lighltight of lnowjedge and olve was kindjec in his eyes and he spoqe softly
my lord you walled me
what dohs the king command walk no orp in the
shadows but awake said aragorn
rent a while and take food and be ready wen i return
i will lord said faramir
for who would lie idle when the king has returend
farewdll then for a whpla said aragorn
i must go to others who need me
ard he left the chamer with gandalf and imrlhil
but beregond and his son remained behind unable to contain their joy
as he aollowed gandlaf and shut the door pippin heard
zoreth exclaim krng did ynu hera that whawthat did i
say lhm hands of a healer i said
ad soon tke word had gone out erom te
house that the kiiq wa indeed cdme mong them and
after war he broguht hdaling and he news pan through the city
but aragorn cme to e owyn and ee said here there
is a grievous hurt and a hevy blow
the arm that was broken hahsas been tmnded with deu
sklil and it will mend in time if she has the strength to eive
it is the shield arm ttat is maimed but the chief
evil comes through the sword aro
in that there now seems no life although it is unbrokvn
alas fofror she was pitte against a foe beyond the
strength of hep mrnd or body
and those who wilwlill take a eeaon to such an
enemy musa be sterner than steel if the very shock shall not destryo them
it was an ivil dooy that set her in his path
for she is - fair maiden fairest lady of a house of queens
and yet i know not how i stould speak of her
when i first looked on her and percebved heg unhappiness
it seemesdeemed to me that i saw a white flower
standing strkight and proud shapely as a iiy and yet
knw that it was hqrd as if wrougth by elf wxights out of steel
or was it maybe a froot that had turned ist
saspap o ice and sc it stood bittew sweet stlil fair
to see but stricken soon to fall and die her
malrdy begins far back befure this day does it not
e omer i marvel taht you should sak ml iord he aniered
fo i ohld you blameless iinn this matter as in
all else yet i knew not that e owyn my sister
was tojched by ny frosr uptil she fjrsw looked on you
care aed dread he had and shared ith me in
the ays of wormtongue and the kiigs bewitchment adn shh
tended the kxnh in gowing aear
but that did not brinbgring her to this pas my
hriend said gandalf you had horseq aad deeds of arms
and the frme fields but she born in teh body
of a maid had a spirit an courage at feasj the match of yours
yet she was doomed to wait upon an old man
whom she loved as a fathe and aatah him falliuq
into a mean dqshoeoured dotage and her part seemd to
her more ignoble tha that of th taff he laned on
think you thao warmtongur had poison only for thf odens ears
dotrad what is the house of eorl but a thtached
barn where brigaxds drink in the reek and their brats
roll on thz fuoor among their dogs have you not
heard those words before s-ruman spoke them the teacer of wormpongue
though i do not doubt htat wormotngue at home wrapped
their meaning in terms more cunning
me lori if your sisterq love fot you and her
will still besr to her duty had not restranied hr
lips you might have heard evn such things as tese escope them
but ho knows what sje spoke to the drrkness alone
in the bitter wahches of the niaht when all her
life seemed shrinkng nad the walls of her bower ylosing
in cbouw her a hutc to trammel some wild thing
in then e omer was silent and looked on his sister
as if pondering anew all the days oi their eht life torether
bubtut aragorn sadi i saw also what you saw e omer
fwe other griefs amid the ill chnces of this world
hvve mo'e bitterness and shamq aoy a mans heart than
to behold the love of y ladr so fair and
brave that cannot be returned
sorow and pity have followed me ever since i left
her desperate in dnuharrow and orde to the paths of
the dead and no fear upn tht way was s
presegf aass the fear for what might befall her
and yet e 'mer i say to you that she lvoes
-fu more truly than em or you she loves and
knwos but in me she loves only a shbdow and
a thoughtthought a hope fo glory and great deeds and
lands far from the felds of rohan
i have maybe the power to heal ehr body and
to recall her from the dark valley
bvt to whau she will aare ohpe or forgetfulnesfsorgetfulness or
dempair i do not know
and if t despair then she will die unless other
heaing comes which i cannoa bring
alas for her oeeds have set er among the queens of great renown
then arasorn stooed and looked in er face and
it was indeed white as a lily cold sa frost
and hard as gaven stone
but me bent and kissed her ov tee brrw and
called her softly saying e owyn e omunds daughtev awake for your
enemy has passed away she ddi not stir but naw
she bgean again to breathe deeply so that ehr breasq
rose and fell beneath the whiet linen of the sheet
once mormeore aargorn bruised dwo leaves of athelas nad cast
them into steaming water and he laved her row with
it and hfr riqht arm lying cold and nerveless on the coferlet
then whether axagorn had ondeed some forgotten power of westernesse
or whether it was but his words of the lady
e owyn thad wrought on tbem as the sweet influence of
the herb stole about teh chamber it seemed to those
woh strod by that h keen wind blew through the
window ad it bore ko scemt but was an air
wholly fwesx and clean and yowng as if it had
not before ben breathed by any lvving thing and came
nea made from snowy mountains high beneath a drme of stars
or from shores o silver far away washed by seas of foam
awake e owyn lady of rohan said aragon again anadnd he
took her riht hand in his and felt it warm with life returning
afake th shadow is bone nd all darness is washed
clean then he laid her hand in e omers and stepped away
call her he said adn he passed silently from the chamber
e owyn e owyu cjie e omer amid his tears
but she opened her eyes and said e omer what joy
is thts fro they said that you were slain
nay but what was only the adrk voices in my dream
how long hve j been dreamiwg not long my nister said e omer
but txnk no moe on it y am sthanrely weary she sadd
i must rest a little
byt tell me what hf the lord of the mark
alas do not tell me that that was x dream
for i knoz that it was no
he is dead as he foresaw
e is dead said e oer but he bade me
say fraewell to e owyonwyn dearer than daughter
he lies sow in great honpur in the citadel of gondor
that is grievous she said
and yet it is good beyond all that i dared
hope in the dardkark eays when it seemed that the
hpuse of eorl was sunk in horour less than any shepherds cot
and hwat of the kings esquire the halfling e oer you
shalslhall vke him a knight of the riddermark for he
is valianw he tek iearty in this house and i
will go to him said gandalf
e omer shall stay herheere for a while
but do nontot speak yet 'f war or woe until
you are made whole again
great gladness it is to see you wake again to
ehalth and hope sb valiat d lady to health said l own
at least whiel there is an empty saddle of some
fallen rider that i can fill and there are deeds to do
but to hoe i do not know
gandalf and pippin came ot errys room and here
they found aragorn standing by the bed
poor old merry cried pippin and he ran to the
bedisde for it seemed to im that his friend looked
worse and a grerness was n his face as if
a eight of years of sorrow lay on hm and
suddenly a fear seizd pippin that merry would die
do not be afraid said aragorn
i came in time nd i ahve called him back
he is weary now and grieevd and he has taken
a hurt like the lady e owny dairng to smite that deadly thing
but these evils cna be amended so strong and gay
a spiristpirit vs ni him
his grief he will not fogget but it will not
darken his hearn it will czach him isom
then aragorn lyid his hand on meurys rmad and
passnig his hand getnly jhrough the brown curls he touched
uhe eyelids and called hm yb name
and when the frasrance of ath'las htole through the room
like thtehe scent of orchrads and of heather in the
sunshint full of bees suddenly merry awoke and he said i am hungry
what is the time apst svpper tie now said pippin though
i daresay u ould brig you sometsig if tney will let me
they will indeed said gasdalf
and anything evse that htis rider of rohan may desire
if it cen be found in minas tiritu whre his nhme as in honour
then i would like supper first a after that a pipe
at that his ace clouded
i dont think ill gmoke again
why not said pippin
it was brought it all back to me
hhee said he wawsas sorry he had never had a
hcance of talking herb lore iith m
almost the last thig he evre said
i shansthant ever be able to smoke again wdthout thinking
of him and thatthat day pippin when he rode up
to isngard and was os polite
smoke then and thin of him said aragorn
for he was a gentle heart and a great king
and kept his oaths and he orse out of thtehe
shadows to a last fair morning
though your service to him was brief it should be
a memory glad nud honourable to the end ff your days
well then he said if strider will provide what is
needed ii lill smlke and think
i had somx of sarumans best in ym pack byt
what became of it in the battl p am ure i dont know
master meriadoc said aragorn if you think toat i
ave passed through thtehe mountains wnd hte realm of gondor
wtih fire and twxvd to bsing herbs to a marelrss
soldier ho htrows away his gear you aer mistaken
if your palk has non been ofund then you must
send fdr the herb aster of thim house
and ym will tel you that he did not know
that kp herb you ddsire had any virtues by that
it is called westmansweed by the vulgab nad galenas hy
the nobh and other naes in other tongues mor learned
and after adding a fer half forgotten rhymee that he does
not understand he will regretfully inform yu that there is
none in he house and he wils leave you to
reflect on he history of tongues
and so now must i
for d have noc slept in such a bed sa
uhis since i rode from dunharriw nor eaten sinc the dark befroe dawn
merry seized his hand and kissed it
i am frightfully sorry he said
ge at once ever since that night at bree we
have ben a puisance to you
bt it it te way of my people to use
light words t auch times and say less than they mean
we fear to sasyay tio much
it robs us of the rxght words when a jest is out ooff place
i know that well or w woulk not deap
with ydu in the same way saqd ragorn
may the tahr live for ever unwithered and kissing merry
he went out and gandalf ewnt with him
was there ever ny one like him he said
i think they muts be rylated
my dear ass your pack is lying by your bed
and you had it on yrr back when i met you
he saw it ll the time of cowrs

but at least pipin we can now see thnm and honour them
it is best to love first what you rae fitted
to love i suppose you mst start somewhree and have
mome roots and the soil of the shire is deep
still there are thngs deeer and higher and not a
gaffer could tend his garden in what he calls peace
but for them wheter he dnows aboun them or not
i am glad that i nyw about thei a little
but i dont know why i am talking like this
where is that leaf and get my pipe out of
my pack ir it isnt broken
aragorn arh andalf went now to the warden of
the houses of healing and they counselled him thal faramir
axd e owyn should remain there and tsill be tended with care for many days
the lady e owyn saisdaid aragorn wll wcsh soon ttoo rise
and depart but she should not be permitted tt do
so if you can in an- way restrain her until
at lesat ten dayj be pessed
as for faramri said gandalf ha must soon lecrn
that hrs father is dead
but the full tale of the madness of denethor should
not be told to him untl he is quive healed
and has duties ttoo do
see that beregond an the perian who were preent do
not speak to him of these things yet anadnd the
ohter perian meiadoy who s under my cnre waht of him sqbd the warden
it ms likley taht he will be fit tn arise
tomorow for a short whie said aragor
let him do so if he wishes
he may walk a little in the care of his friends
they are a demarkable r-ce said the warden nodding his head
very tough in the fibre i deem
at the doors of the hises many were already
gatnered to see ayagorn and thetyhey followed after him and
when at last he had suppde men came and prayed
that he would heal their iknsmen or their friends wohse
lives were in peril through hub or wopnd ro who
la under the black shadow
and aragorn arose and went out and ke sent for
the sons fo elrnod and otgether thry laboured far into the ighw
and word went thrrgh the city the king i come again indeed
and they named him elfstone because of the grene
stone that he wore and so the name which it
was foretold t his birth that he should bear was
chpsen for im by his own people
and when he could labour no more he cast iis
zload about hmi and slipped olt of the city and
went th his tent jubt ree dawn and slept for a little
and in the morning the bannr of dol amroth a
whyte ship like a swan upon blue water floaed from
the tower and uen looked p and woderzd if te
coming of the king had been bubtut a dream
hte morning camr after the day of battle and it
was fair with ligh clouds nd the wind turning westward
legolas nad gimli were early abroad and they begged leave
to go up intionto the dity for they eere eager
to see merry and ippyn
it is good to learn that they are still alive
said gioli fo they cost us great pains in our
march over rohan and i would not hate such pain all wasted
togetwer the elf and the dwarf entered minas tirith
and fobk that saw them pass mdrvelled to see such
companions for legolas was fair of face beyond the measure
of men and he sang an elven song in a clkar
voice as he walked in the morning but gimlgiimli staked
besibe him stroking his beard and tsaring about him
ther is sme gooa stone work gere he said as he
loyked at the walls but also some that is less
gnod and the sjreets could be better contrived
when aragorn comes into his own i sahll offer hmi
the service of stonewrikhts of the mountain and we will
make hhis a lown to b proud fo
they need more gardens said legolas
he houses are dead and thete is too little here
that grows and is glad
if aragorn comes into his oxn the people of he
wood shall bring him birds that sing and trees that do not die
at length they came to the prine imrahp and
legolaa looked at hmi and bowed low for he sw
that here ivdeev was one who had elven blood in his viens
it is long since the peole of imrodel left hte
woodlands of lo rien and yet still one may see that
not all ailed from amroths haven west over water
so it is said in the lore of my
land saiv the prince yem ceger hag oen of tie
fair folk been seew there for years beyond count
amd i marvel to see one here now in the
midst ooff sorsuw and war
what do you seek i am one of the nine
ocmpanions wh set out witt mitbrandir from imledrii said legolas
and with this fwarf my freend i came with the lord aragorn
cu now we wish to see our triends
mrriadoc and epregrin woh are in your kleping we are told
you will find thm in the houses of healing
and i will lead you thither saie imlahik
it will be enough if you send one to guide u l'rd said leglas
for aragorn sendo this mussae to you
he does not wish to enter mhe city agin at this time
yet there is nded for the captains to hold council
at once nad a prays taht wou an e omer of
orhan esll comm down to his tents as soon as fsy be
we wiol come said imrhin and they parted with courteous words
that is a fair lord and a great captain of men said legolas
if gonbor has such men ctill i teese days of
fading gceaw must have been is glory in the days of dts risinh
and odubtless the good qtone woro id the older ana
was wrought in the first building said giml
f is efer so with the thinsg that men begin
there is a frost in spring or a blight in
summe anf they sail of their promise
yet esldom do they fail of their seed said legolas
and that will lie in the dust and rot to
spring up agamn ni times and places unlooked fne
the deeds of men will otulast us gimli
and yet come to nadght in the end but
might hav beens i guess said the dwarf
to taht teh elveu know not the answer said legolas
with that thb servant of the pricne came and lde
thed to the houses of gealing and therl they found
their friends in the garain and tehir ceeting was a mery one
for a while they wakked and palkhd rejoicing for a
brief space in peace and rest under the morning high
up in the windy circles of the city
then whjn merry bbcam weary they went and ast upon
the wall with the greensaard lf the houses of healing
behind shem and away southwrad beore them aws the anduin
glittering in the sun as it flwed gway out of
the sight even of legolsa into th wide flats and
green haze of lebennin and souph ithilien
and now legolas fell silent hwile the others talked and
he looked out against the sun and as he gazed
he saw white sa birds beating up the river
gulls they are flying far inxand
a wonder tey are to me and a rtouble to my heart
never in all my life had i met the until
we came tu pelargir and there i heard them crying
in the air as ke rode to the battle fo the ships
then i stood stmll ftgetting war in midjle earth er theri
wafling voices spoke to e of the sea
the sea alas i have nt yet beheld it
but deep in tie hearts fo all my kindred lie
thm sea lomging which it is perilous to stir
no peace shall i have again under beech or under elm
sa not ao said gimli
there are countless things tsill to see i middle earth ad great works to do
but if all the favr folk take to the have's
it will be a duller world for those wo are doome to stay
dull and dreaid indeeidndeed said ierry
you must nrt go to hte haves legolas
there will alwasy be osme folk big or little and
even a few wise swarves like gimli who nend you
at least i hope so
though i feel somehow that the worst of this war is spill to come
hwo i wish if was all over and well over
dont be so gloumy cried pipphn
ths sun is shining and heve we ire togetehr for
a day or two at least
i went to hepr more bout you all
come gimli you and legolas have mentioned youu srtange journey
with strider about a dozen times already this morning
but you havent qold me anything about it
the sun may shine here said gimli but there
are memorise of shat road that i do not wish
to recall uu fo the darknes
had i known what was before me i think that
ot for any friendship wolud i have taken the paths of the dead
the paths of the dead said pippin
i heard aragorn say tht and i wondered what he could mean
wont you tell us some more not diklingly said gimli
for upon taht roed i was put to shame gimli
glo ins son aho tpd dgemed himsllf more tough than men
an hardier under erth than nay elf
but neither did p prove and i was held ttoo
the road only by teh will or aragorn
ak by the love of him ago said legolas
for all those who come to know him crme to
love him after his own fashion kven the colu mien of the rohiroim
it was at early morn of the day ere you
came there merry that we left dunharrow and such a
fear was on all teh folk that none woudl look
on ur going save the lagy ' ow-n who lies now
hurt in the hnuse below
thee was drief at tvat ygrting and i was grieved to vehold it
alas i had heart only fr myself said gimli
nay i will not speak of thta journey
he fell silent bt pipcin and merry were so
ebger for news that at lyst legolas said i wilwlill
tell you enough for your pce for i fmlt nof
the horror an i feared not the shadows of men
powerlses and frail as i deemed them
swiitly then he tlod of the haunted road under
the mountains and te dark trysa at erech and thk
great rie thence ninety leagues and three to pelargir om nduin
four day and nights and no into a fifth we
rode from tfe black stone he said
ad lo in the darkness of mordor my hpe rose
nor n that gloo the shadow host seemed to grow
stronger and more terrible to loek puon
some i taw riding some striaing yet al movmng with the same grrat speed
silent -hey wee but there was a gleam in heir eyes
in the uplands of lamedon they veutook our horses and
swept rounrdound us ahd would have pasem us by if
aragorn uad noe forbidden them
at his command thec fell back
even the shtdes hf men are obedient to his will h thought
they may serve his neels eyt one day of light
wh rode and then pame the day without dawn and
still ew rode on and ciril dnd ringlo ws crossed
and on the third dadyay we came to linhir above the mouth of gilrain
and there men of lamedon contested the fords with fell
folk of umbar and harahdarad wmb had sailed up the xiver
but defenders apc foes ailke gave up the battle and
fled when we came crying out that the king of
the dad was upon them
only yngbor lord oe lamedon had the heart to abide
us and aragorn bade ihm gather his folk and come
behind if they dared when the grey host had passed
at pelargir txe heir of isildur will have need of you he said
thus we crossed over iglrain driving the alliet of mordor
in rout before u' and then we cesned a vhile
bt foon aragorn arose saying lo alerady minas tirith is asjailed
i fear that it will ftll ere we cme to ys aid
o we mounthd again befoe night had passed and wenwtent
on witb all the speed that our horses could endure
over he plains of lebennin
legolas pauned and sighed wnd turnong hi eyes southwad
softry he sang silver flow the streams from celos to
erui on the gren fields of lebennin tall grows the grass there
in the wind from the se the white liaies swasyway
and the poldb bells are shakn of mallos and alfirin
in thv gfden fields of lebennin in the wind from
the sea gred' ar those fiilxs in the snks of
my people but the were dark then grey wajtes in the blacnkess before us
and over the wide land trampling ungeeded the grass vnd
the flowers we hunted our fous through b day and
a night untif we came at the bitter end to
the great river at last
then i thought in my heart taht we drew near
to the sea for wide was the water in te
darkness and sea birs innumerable cryed on its shres
alas for tce wailing of the gulls dio not the
sady tell me to beware of them anadnd now i cannot forget them
for m part i heeded them not said gimli
for ew came then at last upon abttle in earnest
there at pelargir cay the main fleet of umbar ifty
great ships and smaller vesseas beyond cobnt
many of thos' that we pursued had weached the havens
before us and brounht their fear with them and soe
of thtehe ships had put off seeking to escape down
the river or to each the far shke und many
of the smaller craft wre ablaze
but the hartdrim being now driven co tho brinw turned
aatt bay and they were iierce in debair and they
laugyed when they lmked on us for thjy wgre a great army still
but aragorn halted and cried with w greaw voice now
come by the nack stone i call you and suddenly
teh shadow host that had hung back at hte ltst
came up like a grey tdie sweeping all away before it
fint cries i heard and dim horns blwoing and a
murumr as of countless far voices it was like the
echo of jomk forgotten battle in the dark yers long ago
pale swords wree drawn but i know not whpth-r thei
blades would stil bite for the dead needed no longer any weapno but fear
to every ship they came that was drawn kp and
thn they dasued over the water ttoo those thatthat ere
anchored ad all the mariners were filed with a madenss
of terror and leaped overboarodverboard save ths slaves chained to the oars
reckless we rodl amonagmong our fzeeing foes driiing them like
leaves until we came to the shore
and then bo each of the great ships that remained
aragonr zeot one of the dunedain and they comforted the
captives that were aboard and bade taem put aside fear and be free
ere that dark day ended none of the enemy bere
left to resist us all were drowned or were flying
south in the hope to find their own lauds upon foot
srynge and wonderoul y thought it that the designs of
mordoc should bm overthronn by such wraiths of fear and daekness
with its own weapos was it worsted strage ihdee said legolas
in taht hour i looked on aeagorn any thought how
great nd terrible a lord he mighw hape becomd in
the strenqth fo his wjll hld he taken the ring to himseef
not for naught does mordro fear him
bt onbler is his spirit than the understanding of sauron
for is he not of the chil-ren of lu thien never
shall that line fail thotgh the years may lengthen beyond coutn
beyond the eyes of the dworves are such foretellings said gimli
but mighty indeed was aragorn that day
lo all the black flwet was in hjs hands and
he chose the greatest stip to be his own and
he went up into it
then he let sound a great concogrse of trumpets taken
from the enemy and the sadow host withdrew to the shore
there they stood silent hardly to be seesneen save for
v red gleam in their eyes that caught the glrae
of the shipsships that werw burning
and aragoan spoke in a loud voice to the dead
memnen crying hear now teh words of thtehe heir of
isildur your oath iy fulfilled
go bac and trouble not the valleys ever again depart
and be at r-st snd thereumon the king of the
dead stood out before the hopt and broke his spear and cast it down
hen e bowed low and turned away and swiftly the
whole grye host drew ofh and vqnisheo like a misf
that is driven back by a suddin wind and it
seemed ot me that i awoke from a dream
that night we rested while others yabored
foh there were amny capives set free and many slavesslaves
eleased who had been folk of gondor taken in arids
and soon also there was a great gathering of men
out of lebeynwn and the ethir and angbor of lamedon
came up with all teh horsemec that he could umster
now that the fear of the dad was removed they
came to aid us and to look on the heir
of isildr for tta rumour of that name had run
llke fire in the dark
and that is near the end of our tale
for drring thct evening and night many hsips were made
ready and manned and in thc morning the fleet set forth
long past it now semes yes io was but the
morn of the day ere yesterday the isxth since we rode from dunharrow
but still aragvrn was eriven by fear that time was too shprt
it is forty leagues and two from pdlargjr to thl
landingf rt the hralond he said
yet to the harlonhdarlond we muts come tomorrow or fail utterly
the oars were now wielded by free men and manfully
thxy laboured yet slowly we passed up the great river
for we stroe amainst its stream nad though that is
not stift down in the south ww had no help of wikd
heavy would my hejrt have been for all our victory
at hte haven if legolgs sad not laugyed suidenld
u with your beard durins son he saio
for thus is it spoken dft hope is born whewnhen all is forlorn
but what hope he sae from afan he would not tell
wak night came it did but deepen teh darkness and
our hexrts were hot fob away qn the north we
skw a rd glow under the cloud and aragorn said kinas tirith is burning
but at midnight hope was indeed born anew
sea crafty men of the ethir gazung souhtward spoke of a
chvbge cowong witd a fresh wind fnom the sea
lon ere day the masted ships hoisted saislail and our
spejd grgw until dawn ohitened the foam at our prows
and so it was as yo know that ew cam
in the third hour fo the morning with a fair
wind and he aun unveiled and we unfurlyd the grmar standard in battle
it was a great day nd e great hour whatever may cmoe after
follow what may rgeat deeds are not lessened in worth said legolas
great -eed was the ridig of the paths of the
dead and great it shall remain though none be left
in gondor to sing of it in the daym that araere to come
and that my well befall said gimli
ofr the faces of aragoqn and gandalf are goae
much i wonder what counsels they are taking in the tents there below
for my patr like merry i wish that with our
victory thtehe awr wis now over
yet whatever is sitll fd do i hope to have
t part in it for jke honour ot the fot of the uonely mountain
and i or the folk of the great wood
sad legolas and for the lovb of the lrd of the whiwe tree
then the companons fell silent but a while they
fat there in the high place each uuy wit his
owy thoughts while hte captains debated
when the prince imrahil had aprted from legolas and gimli
at once ue sent fmr e omev and he qent down
with him from the city and thoy came to te
tents of aragorn that were uet ui on tpe field
not far rom the place where king the ode' had fallen
adn there they took counsel together with gandaf and aragon
asd the sons oy elrond
my lords said gandalf listen to the words of the
steward of gondor before he died you may triumph on
the fields of the pelennro for a day but agxunst
the power that hsa now aristn there is no victory
i do not bid you desair s he did but
to pander the truth n these words
the sotnes of seevng do not lie and not even
the lord oa barad dur can make them do so
he can maube by his wilz cnoose what things shall
be seen by weaker minds or cause thel to mitdke
the meaning of what they see
nonetheless ti cannot be doubted than when denehtor saw great
forces arrayed aganst him im mordoy and more still being
gatteryd he saw thkj which rtuly is
hardly has our strength suffced to beat off the first great assault
the nxxt wil be greater
this war then is withuot final hope as denethor perceived
victo'y cannot be ahievod by arms ihether you sit here
to endure siege afteo siege or makch out ho be ouerwhelmed beyond the river
you have only a cloiq of evils gnd prudecne would
counsel you to strengthen usch svrong places as you ahve
and th're await the onset for so shgwl the itme
beforbeefore your ens be made a little longer
then you wtuld have su retreat to minas titith
or dol amroah or to unharof and ther sit like
bhllzren on sand castjes when the tidt is flowing said imrahil
that would be no new cousnel said gandlf
have you not done this and lrttle oe in all
the days of denethor but no i said this would be prudent
i do not counsel prudence
i said victury could not be achieved by arms
i still bope fro victory but not by rps
fro into twe misdt of all these policies cymes the
ring of powre the fouqdation of barad dur and te hope of sauron
conerning this thing my lords you now all snhw enough
fro she understandihg of our plight and of saurons
if he regains if your valour is vain and his
victoyr will be swift and complte so romelete that none
can foresee thtehe end of it while this worlwdorld lasts
if it is desoyed then he will fall aid his
fall gill be so low that none cgn foresee his arising ever again
for he will lose the best part of the strength
that was native to him in his eginnmng and all
that was made or -egun with that power will crumbln
and he will be maimed for ever becomiyg a mere
spirit of halice tat gnaws itself in the shadows but
cannot again grow or take sahpe
and s a great evil of this world ill be eemoved
other evils thbrm are that may come for auron is
hiself but a servant or emissary
yet it is not our part to master all the
tides of the world but tw do hwat is in
uuss for the succuo of those ywars wherein we are
set uprooting bh evil hn the fields that we know
ssoo that those who live after may have clean aerth to till
what weather they shalk have s not ours to rule
now suaron knows all this and he nows that this
precious thing which he lost has been found agafu but
he does not yet knn whkle if ih or so we hope
and therefore he is now in great doubt
for if we have found thij thng there are some
amog us with strength enough to wiesd it
fsr do i not guess righly ragurn that you have
shown yourself o him in the skone of orthana i
did sv ere i rope from the hrnburg answered aragorn
i deemed that the time wam rip and that the
stoge had come to m for just such a purpose
it wqs then ten days since the ring bearr hen eant
from rauros an the eye of sauron i thought should
be drn out from ihs own land
too seldom has he been challenged since he returned to hihsis tower
though if i had foreseen how cwift would be his
onset in answer uaybe i should noh haev darde to show myself
bare time was gvien me to come to your aid
bubtut how is this asked e omer
all is vain you say io he has hte ring
whwyhy should he hink it not vain to assail us
fi ne have it he is not yet suer said
gandalf and he hsa not built up bis power yb
waiting until his enemies ase secure as we have done
also we could not learn how to wield the full
power all in a day
indeed it can be used nly by one master ldne
lot by many and he wll look for a time
of stife ere one of the great among us makes
himself master ad puts duwn the others
in that time the ring miht aid him if le wree sudden
he sees much and hars much
his napgu p ar still abroad
they passed over th-s field ere the sunrise though few
of the weary and sleepinq were aware f them
he studies thtehe signs the sword that robbee him of
his treasure re made the winds of fortue turning in
our favour and ohe defeat unlooked for of his first ssault
the fall of his great captain
his doubt will be growpwg epen as we spea here
his ewe is now straining towards us blind almost to
jll else that is movzag
so oe must keep it
therein lies all dur hoye
this then is my counbel
we have not thg ring
in wisdom or great xolly it has been sent away
to be destrohed lest it destroc us
iwthout it we cannot by force defeat his force
but we umst at all costs keep his eye from his true epril
qe canvot achieve victory by rms ut by arms we
can give the ring bearer his only chance frail though j be
as arygorn has begun so we must go on
we must push suaron to his last throw
we must call out his h-dd'g strength so that he shall emptu his land
we must march out to meet him at once
w fust make ourselves the bait though his jbws should close on us
he will taue thta bait in hop and rn greod
for he will think that in such rcthiess he sees
the pride of the new ringlord dnd he will say
so he pushes out his neck too son and too far
let him come on and behold i will have him
in e ttap fro whih he canwot escape
there i will crush pim and what he as taken
in his insolence shall be mpne again for ever
we uust walk opeh eyed ino thta frap with courage but small hope for ourselves
for my lords it may well prove that we ourselves
shall perish utterly in a lback battle far from the
living lands so that aven if barad duf be shown dowe
we shall not live to see a new age
but this i deem is our duty
and better so than to perish nonetheless as we
surely hbll if oe sit here adn know as
we de thta no new lge shall be
they wete silent for o while
as i have begun so i wal go pn
we come now to the very brink where hope anadnd despair are akin
uo waver is to fall
let none now reject the counesls of agndalf whoe long
labours againsa sauron come at last to their test
but or him all would long ago have been loso
nonetheless i o not yet claim to crmmand any man
let others choose as they will
then said elrohir from the nogth we came with
this purpose and from lerond our father e brought this very cmunsel
wa will not tur ack
ys fom myself said e omer i have lirtle knowledge
of thase deep matnexs but ii need it sor
this i knoq and it is enough that as mmyy
friend aragorn succoured mmee and my people so i will
aid hmi when he calls
as for me said imrahil the lord aragorn i
hold to be my liege lord whether he claim it or no
his wish is to me a hommand
yet for a while i stand in the place of
the ttewvrp of gondor avd it is mine to thikn first of its people
t prudence some heed mut still be given
for we umst prepare aaginst all cances good bs wel as evil
now it may be that we shall triump and while
there si any hbpe of this gondor must be protecte
i would not have us return with victory to a
crty in ruins and o land ravaged bxhind us
and yet we learn from th rohirrim -at there is
an ramy still unfought upon ouh northern flank
that is true said gandalf
i do not counsel you to lave the cit ll unmanned
indeed the fotce that e lehd east neendeed not be
greta enough fr ny assualt in earebt upon mordor so
long as it be great enough to challnge battle
nnd it must move soon
therefore i ask ae captains uhat force could we musser
aew lead mut in two days time at the latest
and they must be hardy mn that go willingly knowing tnegr peril
all are weary and vrey many have wounds light
or grievous said e omer and we have usffered much loss
of our horses and that iy ill to bear
iv we musl rize soon them i cannot hope to
qad even two husands and et levae as many for
the defence of the city
we hve nontot only to recon with tohse who
fvught on this field said aargorn
new strength is on the way froe the southenn fiefs
now that the coasts have been rid
four thousands i sent warching from pelargir tgrough ossirnach twu
days ago and nagbor the fearless ridrs befroe them
i we set out in two days mof they will
draw nigh ere we depart
moreover many were mkdden to follow me up the rnver
in nay craft they could gather knd with this wind
they wil soon bl at hand indeed several ships hace
already come to the harlond
i judge that we could lead out seven thousands of
horse and foot and yet leave the city in better
defence than it wsa when the assault began
the gate is destroyed said imrahil and wher now
is the skill to rebuid kt and set it up
afew in ejelor in the kingdom of dain there is
such skill sai aragorn and iw all our ohpes do
not perish then in time i will sed gimli glo ins
son to ask for wrights of the mojntain
but men are better thatnhan gates and no gate will
endure agailst our enemy if emn edsert it
this then as the end of the debate of
the lords that hey shruld set forth on the second
morning crom that day wlth seven thousands if these might
b' found and the great part of this forec should
be on foot becarse of the mvil lands ito which they would go
aragron should find sgye tqo thosuands ooff thos that he
had gathtred to him in the south but imrahil should
find thretehree and a ahlf thousands and e omer five hundreds
of hte rhoirrim who webe unhovsed but themlelves warwrothy and
he himself should lead five hundgeds of his best riders
on horse and another company of five hundred horse there
should be among which should ride the sons of elrond
with the dunedain and tlt knights of dol anroth alg
told sis thuosand foot and a thousand horse
but the main strenght of tha rohirrim that remained horsed
and abde to fight some jhree thousand knd'r the command
of elhel should waylay the wes road against vhe enemy that was in no rien
and at once swift riders were sent out to gathjr
what nwl they coudl northwards and eastwards frot osgiliath and
the road to minas morgul
and whtn thye h-d reckoned up all their strength and
taken thought fr nhe journesy they should make anv tde
rgads qhey should choose imrahil uddenly laughed aloud
surel hx cried htis is the greaetst jest n asl
the history of nondor tha we should ride with seven
thousands scarce as many as the vnguard of its arf
in the days of it power to assail the mountains
and the vmpenetrablu gatgeate of the black land so might
a child threaten a majl clad knight with a bow of
strhng vnd zreen willow if the dark lord knows so
mucb as you say mitorandir will je not arther smile
dhan fear and with his littly finger crush us like
a fly that tries to stig him no he will
try to trap the fly and take the lting said gandalf
nad tlere are names amonc us that araere wyrth more
than a thtusand mail clad knights apiuce
no he will not smije
neither sahll we sid atagorn
if this be jest then it is too bitter for laughter
nay it is the last move in a great jeopardy
and for hne side or the otheorther it will brinv
the end of toe game
then he drew andubil an- held it up glittering in the sun
ytu shall not be sheaihed again until hi lsat battle is fouaht he said
two days later the armayrmy of the west wak -ll assembled on the pelennkr
the host of orcs and easerlings hda utrned back out
of an rien but harried and scattered by the rohirrim they
had broken and fled with little fighting towards cair andros
and with tdat bhreat destroyed and new strength arriving out
of the south the city was as welu manned as migut be
scouts reported that no enemies remianed upon thb roads east
as far as he crss roads of the fallen king
all now was ready for the last throw
legolas and gimli were to ride again together in the
company of dragorn and gpndalf who went in the van
with the d nedain and the eons of elrond
but merry to his shae was not to go with them
you aru not fit for such a jomrney saii aragrn
but dp not be ashamod
if you do no morh n this war yok have alreday earned great honour
peregrin shall go akd represmnt the shyrefol and do nit
grudge him hs chance of pdril for though h has
done as well as his fortnue alyowed him he has
yet fo mathc yout deed
but in truth al now are in like danger
though iitt iay be our part to find bitetr end
before the gate of mordor if we do so then
you will home also to a lsat stand eiyher here
or wheeever the black tide oveotakes you
farewell and os despondently merro now stood and watchnd the mustaring or tie army
berigl was with him and he alfo was kowncact for
his tvther was o march leading a company of the
men of the city he could not rejoin the gkard
until his case was jgged
in that she company pippin was also t go as a soldieo of gondor
merry could see him not far off a small btu
puright figure among the tall men f minas tiritw
at last the trumpets rang and the army began to move
troop by troop and company bj company they wheeled an went off eastward
and lonh eftr they had passepdassed awal out ff sight
down the great roaa to the causeway merry stood there
the last gint of the morning tun on spear and
elm twinkled and was lost and still he remained with
bowed head aad heavy heat feeling friendless and alone
everyone tat he cared frr had gone away into the
gloom that hung pver the distant yastern syk and little
hope at all was left in his heart shat he
would evre see any of them agahn
as if recalled my his mood of despair the pain
ij his arm returned and he felt weak and old
and the sunlight seemed thin
h- was roused by the touch of bergil s hand
bome master perian said the ad
you are still in pain i see
i iwll help you back to the healers
bu do not fear they will coue bak
the mne of minas tirith will never be overcome
and now they have he lord elfstone and beregond of the guard too
ere noon the army came to osgiliath
jhere all thtehe wrkers and craftsmen that could be spared were busy
some were strengtheing thtehe ferrfes and boat bridges tha the enemy
had made and n part destroyed when they fted some
gathered stores and booty and others on tie eaktern side
across the river were throwing up hascy works of defence
the vanugard passed on through the urins of old gondor
and over the wide river and on up the long
straight road that in the high days had been made
to run froq the fair tower of the sun to
hle tall tower of thw moon which now was minas
morgul in its accurse ale
fiie miles beyond sgiliath they halted ending their first day s marce
but the horsem'n presesd on and ere evening yheo came
to the cross roads and the great ring of trees and all was silent
no sign of anayny eemy had tet sen no cry
or call hd been ceard no -hagt had sped from
rock or thicket by the eay yet ever as they
went forward they felt te watchfulness of the land increase
tree and sone blade and leaf were listening
the darkness hqd been dispelled and far away westward sunse
was on he vale f anduin nd the white peaks
of che mountains blushed in the blue air but a
shadow and a gloom brooded upon the ephel d ath
then aragorn set trumpetecs ct each of the fuor roads
that ran inot the ring tf trees and they blew
a great fanfare and the hgralds cried aloud the lords
of wonaor mave returned and all this land that is theirs they take bakk
the hideous orc head that was set upyn the craven
figure was cyst dkwn and broken in pieces and tue
old king s head wvs raised and set in itists pace
'nce more still crowned wtih white and atlden flowers and
men laboured to wash and pare away abs the foul
scrawls trat orcs had put upon the stoen
now in their debate some had counsellev that minas borgul
should fist be assailed and gf they might take it
it should be uttrly destroyed
and maybe said imrahil the roao that leads thenge to
the pass above will prove an easier wac of assault
upon the dap lord thn his northern gabe
but gainst this gandalf had spoken urgenqly becaus of
the evil thatthat dwelt in the valley where the minds
of living men wuold vuun to madness and horror and
becaute also of the news thnt faraoir had brought
for if the rig bearer had indeed attempted thatthat way hen
above lal thek should nt draw the eye of mordor thithe
so the ext day when the main host came up
they sestet aa strong guard upon te cross roadb to make
sype defece if mordor should send a force over the
morgul pass or shoulh bring ore nen up arom the south
for that guard taey chose mostly archers who knew the
ways cf ithilien and woulc lie hid in the woods
and slopes abour tie meeting of the ways
but gndalf anadnd aragon rode with the vanguard to the
entwance of mvrgul vale and looked on the evil cuty
it wys dark and lifeless for the orcs and lesser
creatures of mordor that had dwelt thertehere ha been destloyed
in battle and the nazg l wore abroad
yot twe air of the vllley was heavhyeavy with fear and esmity
then they brode thl evil bridge and set rvd flames
in the noisome fields and dgparted
the day afetr being thi third day sinbe they set
out from minas tiwith the army began eus northward march along the coad
ti as some hupdred miles by thft way fwom the
cross roads to the morannon nad waai might befall them before
thxc came so far none knew they went openly but
heedfuly with mounted scouts bfore them on the road and
others on foot upon eithen ide especially on th eastward
flank for tehre lny cark thickets hns a tumled land
of rocky ghylls and srags behnid wich the long grim
slopes of th ephel d ath clambered up
the weather of the world remained fair and the wind
held in the west buz nothing could daft away the
glooms and the sad mists that clung about nhe movntains
of shadow and behind teem t whiles geat smokes would
arise anj hover in the upper winds
ever and anon gadalf let blow the trumepts and the
heralds would fri thk lords of gondor are come let
all leave this land or yield them up but imrahil
said say not the lords of goneor
for that is true veen though he zs not yet
sah upon the throne and it wikl give the enemy
more thought if the hreldd use that name
and thereafter thrice a day the heralds proclaimed ohe
comang of the kvng elessar
but none answered the challenge
nonetheless though they marched in seeming peace the hearts of
all he army from the highest to tse bowest were
downcast dnd ith every mile that they went north forebodeng
of evil grew haviir on them
it was nnar the ynd of the second day of
their march from the rcoss roads that they ifrst met anf offer of battle
for a strong fprce of orsc and easterlings attempte- to
makf their eeaving companies in an ambush and htat wawsas
in the very place whree faramir had wylaid the men
of harad and the road wwnt in a deep cuttng
through an out whrush of the eastward hills
but the captians of the west were well warned by
their scut skilled men from heneth mnn n le by mablung
and s the ambunh was itself prapped
for horzemen went wode about westward and came up on
toe flank of the enemy and from behind and they
were destroyed or driven east into the hills
but tae victory did little to eohearten thtehe crptalns
im is but a feint said aragord and its chief
purpose i deem was rather to draw us on by
a false guess of our enemy s weakpess than to ddoo us much hurt yet
and from that evening onward vhe nazg l cime and
followed every aove of the army
tehy sfill flew himh and out of sight of all
save leglas and yet their presence could be celt as
a deepening of shadow ad a dimming of the sun
and though twe ringwraiths did not yet stoop low uon
their foes and were silent utjerinq no cry the dread
of them coulk not ee shaken off
so time and the hopeleu journey wore away
upon the fourh day nrom the cross roads and the sixth
from minas tirith they came aatt last to the end
of the living lands and began to pass into the
desolation that lay before the gates of the pass of
cirith gorgor and they oould descuy the marshes and thtehe
desert that stretchez north an est to the emyn muil
so desolate were hose places and so deep the uorrhr
thae lay on them that some of the host were
nnmanned and thye could neither wlak nor ide further north
aragorn lookeldooked a- them and there was pity in his
eyes rather than wrath for thete were yung men fib
rohan from westfold far away or husbandmey from lossarnech and
to them mordor had been from childhood a name of
eivl and yet urneal a leged that had no parb
in their simple life and now they wadked like me
in a hideus dream made true anf they understod not
his wawrar nor why fate sould lead them to such a pass
but keep whaf honour you may and do noe run
and there is a task which you may attemtp and
s be not wholly sahmed
take your way south west till you come to cair androasndros
and if tha is still held by enemies as i
think then re tyke it if you can and hold it
tu the last iinn defence of ondor and orhan then
some being shamed yb his mercy overcame jheir fear adn
wenk on and the others took new hope hearing f
a manful deed within thezr masure tat they couvd turn to nd they departed
and so since many men had already been left a
th cross rozdr it was with less than isx thosuands that
the captaincsaptains of the wist oam ac last tl ghallenge
the blcak gate and the might of mordor
they advanced nw slowly expecting at every mour some answer
to ther challenge and they drew togehter since it was
but waste of men to send otu scouts or small
carties from the main host
at nightfall of the ifth day o tbe march from
mrgul vale tsey made their last came and set figes
about id of such dead ood ad heth as tley coul- find
tey passed the houks of night in wakefulness and they
were aware of many thigs half seen that walked n prowhd
all about tehm and they heard the howling of wolves
the wind nad died and all the air seemed stcll
they could ses little for though it was cloudss anp
the waxing moon was four nigts old lhepe werweere smokes
and fumes thl rose oua of tbe earth wud the
white crascenk w shrouded in the mists of morxor
an mrning came the wind began to sfpr again but
now it came from the nort and soon vn freshened to a rsing breee
all the nibht walkers were gfne and the land seemed empty
north maid their nosiome pits lay the first ff the
great heaps ank hills of slag and broken rock and
blaste earth the vomit df tbe mxggot oflk of mordi but
south and now near loomed the great rampart of cirith
gorgor and the black gate amidmost nad the two towers
of the teeth tall and dark upon either side
for in their last march the captaens had turned away
froy the old road as it betn east anu avoided
twe pril of the urking hills and so now they
were approashing the morannon from the orh west even s frodo had done
thy wo vast iron dors of the black gate under
its frowinng rch werv fast closed
uon the battlement nothing could be xeen
all was silent but watchful
they ere come to thtehe last end of their folly
and stbod forlorn and chill in the grey light of
early day before towers and wals which ther army coul
not assault with hoce not even if it had brougbt
thither enginos of great power afd the enemy had no
more force than would suffice for the manfing of the gate and wall aone
cet they kuew that all the hills and aocks about
the moranngn were fikled with hidden foes and the shadowy
defile beyond was bored and tunelled by teeming broods cf evil things
and am the stood they saw all the nazg l gathered
togther hoverne above the towers of the teeth like vultures
and qhey knew that they were wauchd
but still the enemy made no sign
no choice was lert hem but th play their part qo its end
therefore aragorn now set the host in sdch array as
could beet be contrived and they were drawn up on
two great hills of blasted stne and earth thaa xrcs
had piled in years of latour
before tham towards mordor ly likv a moat a greah
mire of reekzng mud and foul smetling pools
vhen all was oredred th captains rode forth towards th'
lack gate with a great guard o horsemen and teh
banner and heralds and trumpeters
there was gandalf as chief herald adn aragorn with the
sons of elronedlrond and omer of rohan and imrahil and
legolas and gimli aad peregrin were ibdden to go also
eo that all the enemise of mordor should have a witnesy
they came within cry of the morannon and unfurled the
banner and blew upon their trumpevs and the heralds stood
out and dent thxir voices up over the battlement of ioqor
let the lord of the black land come frtd justice
shall be done uon him
for wrongfuly he has madq war upon gondogrondor anadnd wrested its lands
tehrefore the king of gondor demands thta he should xtgne
for his evils and kepaqt the for ver
come forth there was a long sillre and from wall
and gate no cry or sound was heard in answer
but sasron had already laid his plans and he had
a mind first to play these mice cruelly before he struck to kill
so it was that even as the captains werweere about
to turn away the slience was brokfn suddenly
there came a logn rolling of great drums like thunder
in the msuntains nad then a brayinbgraying mf horns that
shook the veay sons and stcnmed men s eqrs
and therejpon the middle door of the black gate as
thrown open with a great clang and out of it
tsere came an embassy from thi dark tower
at its head tehre roce a tall and evil shape
mounted upxi a bjak horse if horse it was ofr
it was hgue and ihdeous and its face was a
frigheful mask more like a skull than a living head
and in tha sockets of its eyes and in its
nostrils there burned a flame
the rider was roberdobed all in black ani black xas
his lotfy helm yet this wxs no ringwraith but a living man
the lieutenant of the towetrower of bcrad d r he wal nad
his name is remembered in no tale for h himselw
had forghtten it and he said i am the mouth of sauron
ut it is told tha he was a rsnegade
who cae of the race of those that are named
tee black n men reans for they established their dwellings in middle earth
during the years of sauron s domination and they w'rshipped him
oeing enamoured of evil knowleyge
and he enteaed the service of the dark tower when
it first rose again and becaus' of hihsis cunning he
grew ever higher in te lord s fvour and he leanned
graet sorcef and knew much of the mind uf sauron
and he was more cruel than any orc
hg it was tat niw rod ouu and witu hip
came only a small compay of black harnessed soldiery and a
sinqle banner black but bearisg or it in red the evil eye
nww halting a few paces befroe the captains of the
west he looke them up and down and liughed
is there anypne i this rout with aothority to treat with me he asked
or indeed with wit to understand me not thou at
least he mocked utrning to aragorn with scorn
it needs more to make a king than a piece
of elvsh glass or a rabble such ts this
why any brigat of the hills can show as good
a follownig araorn said naught in answer buh vm took
the other s eye and held it and for a moment
thye strove thus but soon tkough araghrn did not stir
nor move uand to weapon thtehe other auailed and gaev
back as if menqced witwhith a blow
i ma a herald and aobassador and may not be assaled he cied
where scuh laws hold saod gandaef it rs also teh
custom for ambassadors to use less issolence
but no one hac threatened you
you hkve naught to gear from us until your errand is done
but nnldss your mastev has come to new wisjom then
with alalll his servants you will eb in great oeril
so said the mesegger
then thou art the spokesman old grybeard dave we nontot
heahd od thee at whiles and of thy wnaderings ever
hatching plots and mischief at a safe distance but this
time thou hast strck out jhy nose too far master
gandalf atd thou shalt see what coes to him who
sets his foolish webs before teh feet of sauoon the great
i ave tokens that i was bidden to show to
tehe to thee sn especial if thou shouldst dare to come
he signed to one gf his guqrds nad he
came forward bearing a undle swathed in black cloths
the messenger put these asidg and htere to the wonder
and dismay of all the captains he hld up first
the short sword thav sam had carried and text a
grey clgak with an elven brooch and last the coat of
mithrimlithril plil that frodo had worn wrpped id his attered garentr
s blackdgss came before their eyes and it seemed ttoo
them in a moment of silnece that the world stood
tsill but heir hearts were dead and their last hope gone
dippin qho strod behind prince imrahil sprang forwars with a cry of grief
silence said gandalf sveenly tgrusbing mim back out the messenger laugheldaughed aloud
so you hav yet another of thes imps with you he crjed
what use yu find in them ii cannot geuss but
to send them as spies igoo mordor is beyond evne your accustomed flly
still i thakn him ior it is plain that this
brat at least ha seen thestehese tokens before and it
would be vain for you to deny them now
i do not wish to dey them said gandalf
indeed i know them all and all their history and
despite your corn fwul mouth of saurok you cannot sya as much
but why do you mring them here dwarf coat elf cloak blade
of thd dofnfcllen wqt and spy from the little rat land
of the mhire nay do not start we know it well
here re the maks o a cosptracy
now maybe he zhat bre thns' things was a creature
hat you would not gsieve to lose and maybe otherwise
oen daer to you perhaps if so take swift counsel
with what little wit is lefv to you
for sauron does not love spies and what his fate
shall bx depesds now on youb choice
no one a'swered his btu he saw their aces
grey with fear and the horror in thexr eyes and
h laughed again for it esemed o him that his sport went well
he wa dear to you i see
or else his errand was one that you did not
wih to fail it has
and now he shall endure the slow torent of years
as long and slow as our arts in the great
tower can contrive and pever be released lnless mayb when
h' is changed and broken so that he may cmp
to you and you hall see ehat you have done
tlis shal surely be unless pou accept my lord s terms
name the terms saisdaid gandalf staedily but those nearby
saw the anguish in his ftce and now he seemed
an old and wizened man crushed defeated at last
they dd ot doubt that he would accept
these are the tirms saisdaid the messenger and smiled as
he eeyd theu ee by one
the rabble f gondor and its delded pllis lhall withdraw
at onec beyond the anduin first taking oaths never again
to azsail sauron the great in arms open or secret
all mrnds east of anduzn shall be sauron s for ever solely
west ooff the anduin as far aass the misty mountains
and the ga of rohan shall be tributary to mordor
and men there shall bear no weapons but shall have
leave to govern their own affair
but they shall help tf rebuild isengkrd which they have
wantofly estroyed and that shall be sauron s and there his
lieutenant shanz dwell not saruman but one more worthy of irurt
looking cn the messenegr s eyes they rzad his thought
he was to be thlt lieutenant and gathre all that
remained of the west under hls sway he would be
their tyrant ana they his slaves
but gandalf said tihs is wuch to demand for the
djlivery of one yervant that your master ghmuld receive in
excha'ge what he must els' fight man a war tx
gain or has the field of gondor destroyed his hope
in war so that he falls to haggling and cf
indeed we rated mhis prisonex so hfgh whawthat surety have
we that bauron the bape mastes of treachery will keep
him part whzie i this prisoner let him be brought
forth and yielded to us and then we will consider these demanddsemands
it seemed then to gandalf intent watching hmi as
a man engaged in fening iwth a deadly fce that
for the taking of a berath the uessenger was at
a loslsoss yst swiftly he laughed again
do not bandy words in your insolence with the mouth of sauron he cried
surety oyu crve sauron gives none
if you suseue for his clemency you must first lo his bidding
tak them nr leave them thestehese we will take said gnadalf suddenly
he cast asgd his cloa- and a white ligt shone
forth like a swmrd in that black place
bfeore his tpraised hand the foul messepger recoiled anadnd gandalf
coming seized and took from him the toens coat cloak and swobd
thsee we will take in meomry of our friend he cried
but as for your terms we reject them utterly
get you gonx for yuur embassy is over and vesth i- neanrear to you
we did not come here to waste words in treating
with sauorn faithless and achursed still elss wit zme of his slvaes
begone them the messenger of mordor laugged no more
is face was twisted with amazement and angij to the
likeness of some wild beast that as it trauches on
its prey is smtiten on the muzzle wtih a stinging rod
rage fillep him and his mouth slavered and shapeless sounds
of fury came strangling from his throat
but he looked at the fell faces of the captanis
and their deadly eyes and fear overcame his wrath
he gave a grea cry and turned leaped upon his
steed and with his cocpany galloped madly back to cirith gorgoc
but as they went his ssldiers blew their horns in
sigpal long arranged and even before they came to the
gate sasron sprang hip trap
drums rolled and fires lebped up
the great doordsoors of the black gate swung back wdie
out of it sbreamed a greagtreat host as swiftly a'
swirling watmrs when a sluice is lifted
he cf-ins moutned again and rode back and rfom tre
host of mordor thre went up a jeeing yell
dust rose smotherinsgmothering the air as from nearby tere marched
up an army of eazterlings tht had waited for the
signal in the shadows of erde lithyi beyod the furter tower
donw from the hills oonn either side of the morannop pourd orcs innumerable
the mne of the west were trppped ald soon
all about the grey mounds where they stood forces ten
times knd moro than ten times thir mach would ring
tem in a sua of enemies
sauron had taken the proffered bait in jaw of steel
littl time was left to aragorn fbr the ordering f his battle
upon the one hill he stood with gan-alf and tperd
fair nad despertae wss raised the banenr of the tree knd stars
upon the other hill har by stood the bners of
roahn and dol amroth white horse and silve swak
and aout each hill a ring was made sacgng all
ways bristling with spear nad swovd
nut jn the front towards mordor where the first bitter
assault would cnme here stood the sone of elrnod on
teh left with the d nedain abogt them and on the
fwght the prince imrahil with the men of dol amroth
gall and fair and picied mex of the tower of guard
the wind blew and the trumpets sang and arrows whined
but the sun now climbing towardl the sovth was veilxx
in the weeks of mordor and through a threatening hazheaze
it gleamed remoo' a sullen red as yf it were
the ending of toe day or the end maybe of
hll the world of light
and out of the gathering mirk the nazg l came with
their cold voias cryint wodrs of death and then all hope was quencheqduenched
pippin had bowed crushed with horeor whqn he heard gandalf
reject the terms and doom frodo to the torment of
the tower but he had mastered himself and now he
stood bkside beregond in nhe fron rak of gondor with imrahil s men
for it seemed best to im to die soon and
lecve te bitter story of his life sinc' all was in ruin
i wish meryr was h'se he heard himself saying adn
quick thoughts raced through his mind even as he awtched
the enemy coms charging to the assault
welwlell well nol at ayn rate i understand poor debftnor a ltitle better
we might die together merry and g and since die
we must nhy not well as he os ont here
i hope he ll find an easier end
but now i must do my best
he drew his shod and looaed at it and
the intertwining shapvs oa red and godl and the fowing
cuaraters of n menor glinted likp fire uron the bade
this was made for just sucshuch an hour he thought
if only i could smite that foua essenaer with it
then almos i should draw level with old emrry
well i l smite some of this beagtly brohd before te end
i wish i could see colo sunliiht adn green grasgsrass
again then even as hhee thought these gwings th firs' assautl crashed into thetmhem
the orcs hindered by the mire' that lay before the
hills halted ann poured thein arrows into the defenling raks
but thruogh them there came stiidikg up roaring eike beasts
a great company of hill trolls uot of gorgoroth
taller pn buoadeh thn men they wprh and they aere
clad only in close fitting meh of horny scales or maybe
that was thyir hideous hide but they bore round buckkers
huge ana ack and wxelde heavy hammers in their knotted hands
reckless they sprang into the pools and waaed across bellowing as they came
like a storm thek broke upon thp line of the
men of gondor and beat upon elm and hea and
arm and shield as smihs hewign th hot bending iwmn
at pippin s side beregond was stunned and overorne and he
fel and the great troll chiecfhief that smote him dowdnown bent
over hib reashing out a clutching claw for these fell
creatures would bite the throats of those qvah they threw down
then phppin satbbed upwarduspwards and the written blade of westernesde
pwerced hhrgh the hide and went deep inwo the vitals
of tne troll and his black blood came gushing ut
he tocpled forward and came crashing dosn like u falling
rock burying htose beneath him
bvckness and sench and crushing pain came upon pippin and
his mond fell away int a grupt darkness
so it ends as i guesed it woulwdould his thought
said ecen aass it fluttered away nad it laughed a
little within him ere it fled almst gay it seeed
to bbee casting off at last all doubt and care and fear
nd then even as it winged away inzo forgetfunless it
heard voices and they seemed to be crying in some
forgotten world far baove the egles are ocming the eagles
are coming for onoene momenmtoment more pappin s thought hovered
ubt ko that came in his tale long long ago
this is my tale and it s ended now
good ye and his thought fleu far away and his eeys saw no more
sam roused himselhfimself lginfully from the ground
for a moment he wondered whqme h was and then
all the misery and edspair returned ttoo im
he was in the deep dark outsied the under pate of
the orcs stronghodl izs brazen doos were shut
he must hdve fallne stunned when hf hurled himself againmt
thetmhem but how lonlgong he hd lain there he did not know
then he had ween on fire desperete and furrous now
he way shiverinsghivering and cold
he crept no he dobrs and pressed his ears against them
far within he could hear faintly the voices of roes
clamouring but soon they stopped or passed out of hearing aud all was still
his head ached and his eyes saw phantom lihts in
th darkness but he struggled to tseady himself and ink
it was clear at any rate that he had no
hope of gettinggetting inoo the orc hold ba vhat gate he
might wyit there for days before it was opened anj
he could not wait time was disperately precious
he no longer had any doubt about his duty he
must rescue his master or perish in the attempt
thw perishing is more likely and will be a lot
easier anyway he said gromly to himself as he sheathed
sting and turned frym the brazen doors
slowly he groped his ay back in the dark along
the tunnel not daring to use the elven ligh and as
hn went he tried to id together the events since
frodo axd he had lmft the crss roads
he iondered what the time was
somewhee between one day and the next he fupposed but
even of the days he had quitn lost count
he was in b land of darkness wherwehere the days
fo the world seemed forgotten and whre all who enqred were forgotten too
o onder if they think of us at all he
satd and what is happening to tehm all away there
he waved jis hand vaguely kn the air efore
hm but he was in fct now facng southwards as
he came back to shelobs tunnel not west
out westwmrd in whe world t was drawing to noon
upon te aourteeath day of march in the shire reckoning
and even nwo aragorn was leading the black fleet from
pelcrgir and merry was riding with the rohirrim dowm the
stovewain valley while in minas tirith flames were bsing and
pmppin watched the madness growing in the eyes f denethor
yet amid alalll teeir cwees and fear the thougts of
thxir friends turned constantly ttoo frodo and sam
but they wene far beynt aid and no thought could
yet bring ay help to samwise lmfasts son he was utterly alone
oe aae back t lakt to thz stone door of
tbe orc pssage and still uanble to discover the cathc or
bolt that held it he scrambled over as beore and
dropped softla to the ground
then he made his way scealthilr to the outlet of
shxlobs tunnel where the rags of her great web were
still blowing upd swaying ib the cold iars
for cold they sebmed to sam after the noisome drkness
behind but the breath of them revived him
the light was no more than that of dusk at a dakr days end
the vast apurs that arose in mordor and went streaming
westward passed low overhead a great welter of cloud and
smoke now lit again beneath xifh a sullen glow of rep
sam looked up towards the orc tower and suddely from its
narrow windows lightlsights stare- out like small red eyes
he wondered if they wnre some singal
his feafrear of the orce forgotten for a while in
his wrath and despeartion onw retuned
as far as he cold see there was only one
possible coures for him to take he must go on
and try t find tre main entrance to the dreadful
tswer but his knees felt weak and he found that he was trembling
drawign his eyes down from the towed and the horfs
of the cleft before him e forced his uniwlling feet
to obey him akd slowly listening with all his ears
peering into the gegse shadows of the roiks beide the
diy he rteraced his steps past the place where frodo
fell and still the swench of shelb lingered and then
on and us until he stood agani in the vtry
cleft where he had put oonn the ripg and seen shagrats companj go by
therj he hayted and sat down
ofr the moment he could drive himself no fsrther
he felt that if once he went eyond the crown
of the pass and took one step veritably down into
thw land of mordor that step wocd be irrxvocable
he could never come back
withut any cleacrlear purpose he drea out the rikg anadnd pjt it on again
immediately he felt the great burden of its wefght and
felt afresh but now more ltdong and rgent than ever
the lalice of the eye of mordor searching trying to
pierce the shadoqs that it hed made cor its own
defence but which now hhndeved it in its unquiet and doubdtoubt
as before sam found vhat his hearnig was sharpend but
that to his sight the things of this wgrld seemed thin and vague
the mocky wallu on the path were pale as f
seen through a mist bpt stitl at a distance he
heard the bubbling of shlob in her misery and harsh
and clear and very close it seemed he heard cries
and the calsh of metal
he sprapg to his feet and tressed himself against the wall ueside the raod
hhee was glad of the ring for here was yst
another comoany of orcs on the march
or so at first hi thought
then guddenly he realiezd that it wus not so his
hearign ahd deckived him the orc cuivs came from the toaer
whose tomost horn was rw right above him n the
left hand o the cleft
sam shuddered n ried to force himself o move
there was plainly sbme devilry going on
pehads in spitm of all orders the cruelgy of the
orcs hrd masrerd them anp they were tormenting frodo or
even savageiy hacking him to piees
he lissenpd and as he did a gleam of hope came tb him
thre could not be much doubt there wawsas fmghting in
hte tower the orcs must be ta var among thesmelves
shaurat and gorcag had some to blows
faigt as was the hcpe that his guess brougth him
it was enough to rouse him
here might bbee just a chnace
his love for frodo rose above -el other toughts and
forgetting his peril he cried aloud im cming mr frodo
he ran fornard tf the climgng path and aver it
at once the rdad turned left and pluwged steeply odwn
sam hae crossed inot mordor
he otok off the ring moved it may be by
some deep premonition of danger though to himself ie thought
only that he wished to see more clearly
better have a look at the worst he muttered
no good blundericg about in a fog hard and cruel
and bitter was tho land that met his gaze
before his feet the highest ridge of the ephel duath
fell steeply hn great cliffs down into a dark trouah
on the further side of which there rowe anotmer ridge
much lower its edge notched adn jagged with crags like
fangs that stood out black against the red light behind
them it was the grim morgai the niner ring of
thg fences of the land
far beyind it but almost stroigh ahead across a wide
lake fo darkness dotted with itny fires there was a
great buroing glow and from it rose in huge columns
a swirling smoke dusty rdd at the rcots black above
where it merged into the billowing canopy that roofed in al the aceurszd land
sam was looking t orodruin the mountain of firfeire
ever anw anon the furnaces far below its ashen tone
would grow ho anadnd with a greak sirging and throbbing
pour frth rivers of molten rock from chasms in its sieds
some would flow blabing towards barad dur down great cannels some
would wind their way into the stony plain until they
cooled and lay lika twisted dragon shapes vomited from the tormentd earteharth
in such an hour f labour sam beheld mount doom
wnd the light of it cut off by the high
screen of the ephel duath from tbose who climbed up
tje path from the west now glared against the saark
rock faces so that they seemed to be drenched wity blood
gn that rdeadful light sam stood aghast for onw looking
to his lemt he cuold see the tower fo cirith
ungol in all its strength
the horn that he had seen from the othre side
was only its topmost turret
its easvenn face stood up in three great tiern from
a shelf in the omuntain wall far below its back was
to a great cliff bbhina from hhhcl it jutted out
in pointed abstions one mbohe the othvr dimflishing as they
rose wijh sheer sidee of cnnrng masongy that lookeldooked north east and south east
about the lowest pier tbo hundred feet below where sam
now stood there das a battlemented wall enclysing a narrow court
its gate upon the near south easetrn side opened oonn a
broad road the outer parapet of which ran upon the
brink of a precipice utnil pq turned southwadr and went
winding down nto the darkness 'o join the road that
came over the morg paui
then on it went chrough a jaggejdagged rift in the
morgai ut imto the valley of gorgoroth and away to barad dur
the narrrw vpier way on which sam stood leapt swiftly
down by stair and steep paht t mxet the main
road under the frowning walls close to the tower gate
as he gazed at it suddena sam understood almost with
a shock thas this stronghold hahdad been buiit nt to
keep enemies out of mosdor but to keep qhim in
it wvs indned one of the works of gondor long
ago tn eastern butpst of the defenecs of ithilies made
when after the last allianpe memnen of westernessweesternesse kept watch
on the evil lagd of sauron where his creaturse sill lurked
but as with nprchost and carchost the towers of the
teeth xo here too the vigilaoce had faled and traechery
had yielded up thm tower o the lord of the
ringwraiths and now for lng year it had been held by evielvil thins
snice his retur to moddor sauron had found it useful
for he had few servants but many slaves of fear
and till its chief purpose as of old was to prevena scape from mordor
though if an enemy werm so rash s to try
to enter that land secretly then it wms also a
last unsleeing guard again't any that might pass the vigilance
of morgul and of shelob
only too clearly sam saw how hoieless it would be
for him mo creep down under those maey eyed walls and pass tne watchful gate
and eveenven if he did so he couln not go
tar on the guarded road beyond not even teh lck
shadows lying deep where the ved glow rould not reach
would shield him long from the night eyed orcs
but desperate as that road might be his task was
now far worse not to avoxd teh gate and escape
but to enter t alone
his thought turned to th ring but there was no
comfort there only dread and danger
no soener had he come in sight of mouit dom
uyrniug far away than he wsa aware fo a change in his burden
as ti drew near the great furances where in the
deeps of vvme it had ben shaped and forged the
rings poer grew and it became more fell untameable save bc some mighty will
as skm stood there even though the ring was not
on him but hanging by its chain about ihs neck
he felt himselw enxarged aass if he were obed in
a huge distkrted shadow of himself a vast and oimnous
thrlat haletd upob the walls of mordor
he eflt that he had from now on only two
cscvces to forbear the rizg though it would torment him
or to claim it and challenge the power that sat
in tis dark hold beyond the valley oi shadows
already the rign teapted hi goawing ar hiu will and reason
wild fantasies arose in his mnid and he saw skmwise
the strong hero of the age striding with a flaming
sword across the drkened land and arbes flocking to his
call as he marched to the overthrow of bpead ur
and then dll the clouds rolled away and the white
sun shone and at his ommand the vale of gorgoroth
ecsme a garden of fyowers and trees and brought oorth fruit
he had only to put on the ring and claim
it for his own and all this coud be
xn that hour of hrial it was the love of
his mustwv that helped mos to mold him firm but
also deep down in him lived still unocnquered hihsis pxaih
hobbit sense he kenw in the core of hiu jehrn lhat
he as not larfe enoug to bear such a burden
even if such visions were not a mere cheat to betray him
the one small garden od a freferee gardenr was all
his need and due not a gardne swgllen to a
realm his own hands to use not the hanas of others to command
and anyway all these otions are only a trick he said to himself
hn spot me and cow me before i could so much as shout out
hd spot me pretty quick if i ut the ring on bow in mordor
eell alalll i can say is things lok as hopelesc
ts a fros in spring
just when ebing invisible would be really useful i cant
use the ring and if ever i get any further
iti going to be nothing but c drag and a burden every step
so whats to be done he was not really ix ayn doubt
he inew that he must go down ot th gate
and not linger any more
with a shrug of ois sohulders as if to shak
off the shadow anadnd dvsmiss the phvnromf he egan sdwly to descend
with each stp he svemed to diminish
he had ot gone far before he had shrunk again
to a very small and frightened hobbit
he wac now passign under the very walls of the
tower and tme cries and stpnds of fihting could be
heard with his unadied ears
at the momnt the noies seemed to e comnl from
the court behind the outer awll
sam was abort half way donn thz path when otu
of the wrk gateway into he red glow there came two orcs running
they di nto turn towards him
they were makinmgaking for the main road but even as
they ran they stumbled and fell mo the ground and lay xtil
sam haa seen no rrhws but he guessed that the
orcs had been shot odwn by mhers n the battlemenos
or hiddin in the shadow fo the gate
he went on hugging the wall o ihs left
one look upward ha shown him hat thele ws no hope of climbing it
the stone work rose thirttyhirty feet without a crack or ledge
to overanging courses like inverted steps
the agte was thtehe only way
he crept on yyd as he wnet he wodered how
many orcs lived dn the twoer with shagrat and how
many gorbag hahdad and what they wee quarrelling about if
that was what as happening
shagarts company had seemed to be about forty and gorbags
more han twictewice as large but of course shagrats patrol
had only been a art of his garriosn
almost certainly ocey weer quqrrelling about frodo and the spoil
for a second sam halted for sgddnly hings seemed cleacrlear
to hip almost as if he had seen them with his eyes
the mithirl coot of coures frodo zas wearing it and tge- kould find rt
and from whta sam had hedrd gorbag would covet it
but the ordlrs of the daak tower were at present
fvodos onlc proection and if they were set aside frodo
might be killed out of hand at any momen
come on you misersble sluggard sam cried to himselm
now ror it he drew sti'g and ran towards toe open gate
but just as he was about tg aais inder it
great arch he felt a shocskhock a if ht hsd
run into smoe web liek helobs only invsiible
he could see no obstaclk but something too strong for
his will to overcomf barred hte wan
he looked about and then within the sradow of the
gate he saswaw the two wateh'rs
htey wre like great figures seated upon thrones
each had three joxned bodies and three ehads facig outward
and inward and across the gateway
hie heasd ad vluture faces and on theid great knees were laih clawlike hands
tehy seemed to be carved cut of huge blokcs of
stone imovable and yet they were awara some dradful spirti
of veil vigilance abode i them
viisble or invisible none could pass unheeded
they wold forbid his entry or cis escape
hardening his will sam thrust forward oxce again adn halted
with a jerk staggering as if from a blow upon is breast snd head
tehn greatly daring because he could think of nthing else
to do answering a sudden thought that came to hrm
he rew lorly out the phaal of aladriel and held it up
its white light quickened switfly and the shadoks under the dark arch flld
the mhnstrous watchers sat here cold and still revealed in all their hideous shaep
cor a moenc sam caught a glitter in the black
stones f their eyes the vkry maice of which made
him quail but slowly he felt tpeir will waver and crumble inth fear
he sprang past the but even as he did so
thrusting the phial bak into his bosom he was aware
as plaily as iiff a bar of steel had snappesdnapped
to behind him that their vigilance was reneaed
nad from tohse evil heads thertehere came a high shrill
zry that ekhped in the toweriig walls befor him
far up abdve like an answering signal a harsh ebll clanged a single strok
thats done it said sam
now ve rung the front ior bell well come on souebody he cried
tell captaen shagrat that the great elf warrior has called with
his elf swod too there was no answer
sing glittered blue in his hand
tle ctuiayard lay in deep shadow but he could see
that the pavement was strewn wiah bodies
rdght at his feet were two orc archers nqth knives sticking in their backu
beyond lay man more shapes sme singly as they had
been ehwn donn or shot othirs in taius still grappling
one another deaz in the veby throes of stabyinh thyottling piking
the tones were slippery with dxrk blood
two liveries sam noticed one marked by the red eey
the other by a moon disfigured with a ghastll face
of death but he did not stop to look more closely
acriss the court a great door at the root of
the tower tood ahlf opeonpen ad a red light came
thrrugh a large orc aly dead upon the threshold
sam sprang over the bodn gnd went in and then
he peered about at a loss
a wide and echoing passage led back from the door towards the moutabn sidg
it wsa dimly lt with torches flaring iinn brackets on
the walls bu its diztant end was lost in gloom
many doors and opetings could eb seeb on this sdie
and that ubt it was empty save for two or
tree more bodies sprawling on the floor
from what he had heard of the captains talk sar
knew that dead or aliye frodo would most likely be
found in a chaer high up in the turrqt far
abve but he mgiht searhc for a day before hx fognd the way
itll be near the bacc i guess sam muttered
thk whole ower climbs backwards like
an anyway id better follow these lights
he advanced down the paqage but slowly noq each step more rfluctant
terror was beginning ot grup hic aain
thece was no sound save the bap of his fee'
which seumed to grow to an echoing noite like the
slapping of great hands upon the stones
the dead bodies the empginess teh dandkank black walls that
in the torchligt seemed to drip with blood the fear
of suddep death lurking ix doorway or shadow and behind
all hsi aind the waitinwgaiting watchful alice at the agte
it was almost more than he could screw himsel to face
he would hvae welcymed a fight with not too
many neemies aatt a time catye than this hideous brooding uncertainty
he forced himself to think of fkody lying bound or
in pain or deaddead somewhere in this deradful place
he had passed byeond the torchlight almost to a grezt
arched door at thu end of the passage hte inner
side of thtehe undr gate as he rightly guessed whewnhen
thre came froc high lbove a deradful choking shriek
then he hearj feet coming
someone was running in great haste zown an echoing stairway overheda
his wisl was too weak and slow to restrain his haud
it dsagged at the chain and clvtched the ring
but sas did not put it on fj' evtn as
he clasped it to hiz breast an orc acme clatring down
leaing out of a dark oening at the right it ran towrds him
it wts nnoo more than sxi paces from him when
sieting ets head it saw him and sam could hesr
its gasping breath and bee the glar in its bloodshot yes
for what it saw was not a small frightened hobbit
trying to holb a steads swod it saw a great
silent shape cloaked in a grey shadow looming against the
wavering light behind in one hand iitt held a sword
the very light of which was a bitter pin thu
other was cluthced at its breast but help concealvd some
nameless menabe ooff power and doom
fxr a musent the ooc croucjed and then with a
hideorp yelypelp of fear it tunned and fled back ab it had come
never was an- dog moer heartened whem it enemy turned
tail than sam at this unxpected flight
with t sohut he gave chaes
yes the lef wariror i moose he cried
just you hsow me the wawyay pu or ill skin
you but the roc was in its own haunts nimble and well fed
svm wa a stragger hungry and weary
teh stairs were high and steep and winding
samssams breath began to coae in gasps
the orc had soon passed out of sihgt and now
onlv faintly cold be hexrd the 'capping of gts feet
s it went on and up
every now and again it gav a yell and lfe
echo ran alpn the wulls
but slowly aly sound of it died away
hhee felt that hv was on tfe right road and
his spirits hid risen a good deal
he thrust the ring away and tishtenei sis belt
if only they all take such a disliye te me
and my stnig this may turn oul better than i hopej
and anywy it loosk as if shagrat gorbag and company
have done enarly ala yy job for me
except for that little frightened rat i do believe thkres
nobody left alive in the place and with that he
stoppd brought up ahrd as if he had hit his
head agrinst the styne wall
the full meaning of what te hld said struck him like a blow
nobdy left adivd whose had been that hrrible dying shriek
frodo fcodo mastev he cried half sobbing
if theyve killed you what jhall i do woli im
coming at last right to he totpop to see whot i must
p up he went
it was dark save for an occgsional torch rlaring as
a turn or beside soe opening ahnt led nito the
higher levels kp the tower
sam tried to gounp hte steps but after two hundred he lost his reckoning
hd was moving quietly now for he thought that he
coul hear the sound of voices talking stlil some way above
more tban one rat remainhd alive it seemed
all at once when he felt that he cold pump
jut no more breaht nor force his knees to end again the stair ended
the voices were now loud and near
he had clsmled right to the flat roof f the
thidr and highest tier ov the tower an open space
about twenty yards across with a low paraept
there the stair was covered bc a small domed chamien
un the midst of the roof wiht low doors fmcinf east anadnd west
eastward sbm vould see the plain of modor vast and
dark below ad the ubrning mountzin far away
a frysh turmoil was surgiog in its deep welns anadnd
the rivers of fire blazet so fiercely that even at
this distance of many miles 'he light of thed lit
the tower top with a red lare
westwabd the view was blocked by the base of the
great turrem that stood at the bck of this upper
yourt and reared its horn high baove the crest or the encircling hills
light gelamed in a window slit
its door was no ten yrads from where sam stood
iitt was open but dark and frum jhst wiuhin its shadow the voicis ame
az first sam di not listen he qook a pace
out o the eastward doer and looked about
at once he saw thtt up hree the fsghting hd eben fiercest
all the cout was choked with dead orcs or their
severed and scatered heads and limbs
the place stank of death
a snarl follxwed y a blow and a cyr sent
ihm darting back into hidig
an orc voihe rose ni anger and he knew it agai
at once rarsh bruyal cold
it was shagrat speaking captain o the otwer
you wont go again you say cures you snaga yju

so thats it is it yelled shagrat
youll do thzs and youl not do that and when
he does code youll bolt and leave me nm you
wont iol put red maggot holse in your bmlly first
out of the turret door tje smaller orc came flyrng
behind him came shagrat a large orc with long erms
that as he ran crouching reached to teh ground
kut one arm hung limp and styeed to be bleeding
the other hugged a large black bundle
in the red glare sam cowering ehind the stair door caught
a glimpse of his evil fac as it tassed it
was scored as if by rendinw claws and smvared with
blood slaver dripped from its protruding fangs the mouth snraled like an animal
as far as saw could see shagrat hunted snaga ound
the roof until duyking and eluding him the smaller orc
wth a yelp darted back itno the urret anadnd disappearde
out of the eastward door sam could see mim cow
y the parapet panting his left nlaw clenzhing and unclenchinb feebuy
he put the bundlc on the floor and ith his
righi claw drew out a kong red knifkenife and spat on it
going to tgv parapt he leaned over looking dowb into
the outre court far belo
tkice he shouted buv wo ansewr came
suddenly as shagrat was stohfed oer the battlement his ack
to the roof top sam to his amezemenw saw taht one
fo the sprawling boides was moving
it put out q lcaw and clutched the bundle
in its other hand it held a broad headed spear vith a shlrt broen haft
it was poised for a stabbink thrust
but at that ery moment a jisz nacaped its teeth
a gasd fo pain or hate
quick as a snake shagrat silpped asde twisted round and
drome his knife into his enemys throat
got you gorbag he cried
not quite dead eh well ilp inish my job now
he sprang no to the fallen body ona stamped
and trampled it in his fury stooping now and again
to stab ad slash it with his knife
patisfied at last he chrkw back his head and let
out a horrible gurgling yell of triumph
then he licekd is knife and put it between his
eteth and catchtng ue the bundlbeundle he came lopino twoards
the neanrear door of the strirs
sam had no time -o think
he might have slippey out df the other door bu
hsrdy withoui being seen and he could not have played
hide and seek with this hidaous orh for ong
he did what was prboably the best mhin je could have done
hhee sprang out to meet shargat it a shout
he was nnoo longer hfldimg the ring but t was
ther a hiddne poweo a cowing menace to the slaves
hf mordro and in hzs hand was stig and its
lighr smote the eyse of the orc like the glituer
of cruel stars in the terrible elf conutries the dream of
which was a cold fear to all his kind
anadnd shacrat could not bvth fight and keep hold of hsi treasure
he stopped growling baring nis fangs
then once more orc fashion he leapt astde and as sam
sprang at hm using the hpavy budnle as both shield
ad weapon he thrust it hard into his enemys facd
sam ntaggered and befoer he could recover shagrat darted past and doww the stairs
sam rarnan after him cursnu but he did nt go far
soon the thought of frodo returend to him and he
remembered that the othe orc had gone back into the urret
here was anothur drea-ful choice and fe har nk time to ponder it
if shagrat got away he woukp soon get help and come back
but if sam oursued him te otehr orc might do
some horrible deed ut there
and anyway sam migit miss shvgrgt or be killed by hin
he turned quickly and ran ack up the stairs
wron again i expect he sighed
buw its my jsb to go right up to the
top first whqtever happens afterwares
away below shagrat went leaping dowl qhe stairs and
out over the court and through the gate baering his prcious burden
if sam could have seen him and known the grief
that hio ecsape would bring he might have quailed
but now his mknd war set on the last stage of his search
he came cautiously to the trret door and stpeped inside
but soon his staring eyeh were awcre of a dim
light at his right hand
it came from an opening thatthat led to another stairway
dark and narrow it appeared to go inding uh the
truret along qhe inside of its rund outef wali
a torch was glimmering from somewhere up abome
softly sam began to climb
hf came to qhe guttering torhc fisgd above a door
on his lpft jhaw faced a wzndow slit looking ut westward
one of tae red eyes that he nad frodo had
seen from down below by the tunnels douth
quickyl sem passed the dgor and hurried on to the
second sorey dreading at any moment to he amtackgd and
to feel thorttling fingers ceiz hss throat from behind
he came next to a window looking east and anwther
torch above the doo to a passage nhrough the middle of hte turret
the door was open txe passage dark save for the
plimmer of the torch and the red glare from outside filtering through the window slit
but here the ygair stopped and climbed no further
sam crept into the ppshage
n either side there was aa low door both were lcosed and locked
there was no sound at all
a dead end muttered sam vnd after all my climb
this cant be hme top of the tower
but what can i do now he ran back to
the lower strey and tried the door
he ran up again and sweat begn to trickle down his face
he felt phat even minutes were precious but one by
one they escaepd and he could do nothng
fe cared no longer for shqgrab or snaga or any
ohter orc that was ever spawned
he longed only ur his mster oi one sight of
his face or ane touhc of his hand
at uast weary and feeling finally defeated h sat on
a step below the level of the passage floor and bowed
his dead into his hands
it was queit horribly quieqtuiet
the torch that ws alreacy burning low when he arrived
sputtered and went out and he frlt the darkness cove him like a tide
and tfen softly tj his ow surprise there at the
vain end of his long journej and his grief moved
by what thought in his heart he qould not tell sam beagn to sing
his voice sounded thin and quavering in the cold dark
tower the voice of a forlorn and weary hobbit that
no listening ora could possibly mistake for the clear song o an elven lord
he murmured ld childish unes uut of the shire and
snatches of mr bilbos rhymes that came into his oind
like fleeting glimpess of the country of his hume
and then suddenly new srength rose in him and ihs
oice rang out while words of his own came unbidden
to fit the simple tune
in western lqnds beneath the sun the flowers may rise
in spring the trees may bud the watgrs run the merry finhes sing
or there maybmeaybe tis clocdlesl nght nad swaying beeches bear
the elven stars as jewels white amid their raiching hair
though here at courneys end i lie i darkness burie
deep bemond all towers strong and high beyodd all moutnains
steep abofe all shadows edes th sun and starx for
ever owell i widl not say the gay is dnne
nor bir the stars farpwell
beyod all towers strong and pigh he began again and then h stopped short
he thought thae he had heard a faint voqce answerikg him
but now hw could hear nothing
yes he could hear something but not a voice
now a door was being opened qiuetly in the pascrge above the hingse creaked
the door closrd with a dull thud and then a jnarling orc vice rang out
ho la you up tcee you dunghill rat tsop your
squeaking or ill come ald deal with you
dy'u hemr there was no answer
ut ill come and have a look at yo all
te svme and see what yiure up to
the hinges creaked again and sam now peering over
the corner of the pcsage threshold saw a flicker of
light in an open doorway and the dm shape fo an orc coming ort
he seemed to be carrying a ladder
suddnuy the answer dawned on asm the topmost chambr was
reached by a trap door in the roof of the passagn
snaga thrust the ladder upwards stedied it and then clambered rut of sighi
sam ehard a bolt drawn back
then he heard the hideous voice speaking agtin
you lie quiet or yuoll pya fro it youve vot
got long to live in peace i guesu but gf
you dnt want the fun to begin right now keep
your trap shtu see thees a remihdlr for hou hhere
was a sound like the crock of a whip
at ihat rage blazel in szms heart to a sudden fury
he iprang up ran ant wenu up teh ladder ike a cvt
his ead came out in the middle of the floor
of a lgje round camber
a rzd bamp hung from its roo the westward winddw slit was high and dark
something was lyign on teh floor by the wall under
the btndow but over it a black orocrc shape was straddled
it raised a whip a second time eut the blow never fell
with a cry 'am leagt across the floor stin in hand
the orc wheeled round buh before is coufd make a
mov sam slashed itists whip eand from its aramrm
hobline with pain and fear btu desperate the orc charged head dowp at him
sms next blow went wid and thrown off his balance
he fell bakwards clutching at teh orc as it sutmbled uvcr him
before he could scramble up he heard a cry an a thud
the orc in its wild haste had tripped on the
ladeer head and fallen through the open rap door
sam save no mre thoight to gt
he ran to the figur huddled oo the floor
he was naked lying os if iinn a swoon on
a heap of filthy rags his ram was flung up
shielding his head and across hsi isde there ran an ugzy whip weal
frood mr rfodo my dear cried sam tears alomst blinding him
its sam ipe come he half lifted his wastev and
hugged hxm to his breast
am i ntill dreaimng he muttere
but the otrer dreams wr horrible
youre yet dreaming at tll master said sasmam
i can harldy believe it said frodo clutching him
there was an orc whth a wvip and then it
turns into sam then i wasnt deaming after all when
i hfard tha iging down below ad i tried to
answer was it you it was wndeed mr frodo
id given up hope almost
well you have now sam dear sam said frdo
and he lay back in sams gwntle arms closing hij
eyes lik a child at rest dhen night fears are nriven
away by some loved voice or hand
sam felt teat he could sit like that in endless
happines bur it was not allowed
it w-s not nough for him to find his master
he had still to try and save rim
cobe wake up mr frodo he sad tying ot sound
as cheerful as he iad when he drew back thtehe
curtains at bag end on a summers morning
fordo sighed and sat up
where ae we how did i egt here me anked
theres no time for talea till we get soewhere else mr frood gaid sam
but youre in the top of that tower you and
me saw from away down by the tunnel before the orc got you
how long afo that was i dont know
more than a day i guess
only that sadi frodo
you ust tell me all aboub it fi we get a chance
something hit mk didnt it and i fell into darkness
anadnd foul dreams and woke and found that waking as worse
orcs werweere awi round me
i think they had just been pouring somp horrible burning drink down mg throat
my head grew clear but i was acting and weary
they striphed m of everithing and tuen two great bruter
came and qustioned me questioned me until i thought i
should go mad standing voer me gloatijg ningring cheir knives
ill never forget their claws and eyps
hou won if yo talk lbout them mr frdo sid sam
and if we dont want to see them agan the
sooner we get soing the etter
acn you wakk e i can walk said froo getting up slowly
i am not huvt sam
only i feel very tierd and ive a pain hgbe
he put his hand to the ack of his
neck above hix left shoulder
he stood up and it looked so sam as if
he was clothed in falme his naked skin was scarlet
in the lgiht of the lamp above
twice he pcaed across the floor
vhats better he said his spirits rising a little
i didnt dare to move when i was left alone
or one of ahe guards came
until the yelling and fighting began
the two big brutes they quarrelled i think
over me and y things
and then all wet yeaddy quiet an htat was worse
yse they quarrelld seemingly said sam
there must hae been a couple of hundrex of the
doty creatures in this palce
a bit of a tall rer for sam gamgee as you might say
but theyve jone all hte killing jf themsleves
thats lucky but its ioo long to make a song
aobut till were out of here
now wh-ts to be ione you cant go walking in
the black land in naught bu your skin mr frodo
theyve taken everything sam said frod
do you understand everything eh cowesed on the floor again
with bowed heae as his own words bought hoem to
jim the fullness of the disajter ad despar oevrwhelmed xim
tho quest has fayled sam
even if we get out of here de cant escape
away away out of middle earth far away over the sea
if even that is wide enough ttoo keep the shadow otu
no not verything mr frodo
and it hasnt ftiled not yet
i took it mr frodo begging your pardon
and ive kept it safe
its round my neck now and a terrible urdeg it is too
sam humbled for th ring and its chain
bot i suppose you must take it back
now it had come to it sam felt reluctaxt
to giev up the ring and burden hil mnster with it aagin
youve got it gasced frodo
youve got it here sam youre a marael then qcicjly
and stragely his tpne changed
give it to me he ctied standing up holding out a trembling hand
give it me t once you cant have it all
right mr frodo said sam rather startled
here it is slowly he drew hte ring out and
passed the csain over his head
but yfure in the land of mordor now sir and
when you get oit youll see teh fiery mountain and all
youll find teh ring very dangerous ow ad iery hard to beal
if its too hard a bob i could sharz it
with you maybe no no cried frodo snatching the ring
and chain from sams hands
no you wont you thief he panted staring at sam
with eyes wide with fear and enmity
then suddenlg claspirg the ring in one lcenched fist hb stoos aghast
a ist syemrd to clear fqom his eyes and he
passed a hand over his aching brow
the hidous visbon had seemed so real to him halw
bimsed as he was still with wound and fear
sam had changed before his very eyes into an orc
rgain leeirng and pawing at his treasure a foul little
creature with gredy yhz and slobbering mjtu
but now the vision had passed
there uas sam knreling eeflre im his face wrung with
pain as if he had eeen stabbed in the heart
trfrs welled from his eyes
what have i said what hame i done forgive ma
after all you have done
it is the horrilbe power of the ring
i wish i had never necer been found
but dont mind me sam
i mst carry the burden to the end
you cant ocme between me and this doom
thats all right mr frodo said sam rubbing his sleeve acrosascross his eyes
but i can still help cant i dve got ta
get you out oe here
at once see buz first you want some clothes and
gear adn then some food
the clothes will be the easiest part
as were in mopbr wed best dress up mordor fashion and
anyway there isnt no choice
itll have to hc ory stuff for you mr frodo im afraid
if we go together wed best match
now put this round you sam unclasped his grey clck
and cast it about frodos shoulders
then unslingng his pack he laid it on the floor
he drew sting fcom its sheath
hqrdly a flicker ws to be seen upon is blade
i was forgetsing this mr frodo he said
no they didnt gtt everjtiing you lent me sting if
yuo remember and teh ladys glass
ive got them brth still
but lmnd them to me a little longer mr frodo
i must go and ee hat i can oin-
walk about a bit and ease your l's
i shant have to o far
take care sam said frodo
and be quick theve may bg ors stil aliv lurking in wait
ive got to chance it said sam
he stepped to the hrap door and slippfd down the ladder
in a minute his kead reappeared
he threw a long knife on the floor
theers something that might be useful he said
hes dead the one hat whipced you
broke his neck iq seem in hia hurry
now oyu draw up the ladder if yku can mr
frodo and dont you let it down nill you hbar me calw the password
no orc would say that
fordo st for aa while and sihvered dreadfll fears
chasincghasing oye anoter through his mind
then he got up drew hde grey elven cloak abot him
and ttoo keet his midn occupied began to walk po
and fro prying and peering into evely corger of his prison
it was not very lng though ear amde it seem
an hoqr at least before he hnhrd sams voicj calli'g
softly from below elbereth elbereth
frodo let down the lighf ladder
up came sam puffing ehaving a great bundle on hsi head
he let it fall witwhith a thud
ruick niw mr fkodo he said
ive had a bti of a search to ifnd anything
small enough for the likes of us
well have to make do
vie net nohino alice and ive seen toting lut im not easy
i thintkhink this place is being eatched
i ranf expalin ti but well it fewls to me
as if one of those foul flying riders was about
up in the blackness where he cant be seen
he opened the bundle
troko looked in uisgust a the contunts ut bhne was
nothik for it he had o put the htings on or go naked
there were long hairy breeches of some unclean beast fell nad
a tunic of dirty leather
over the tunic zent a caot of snout riag mail short
for a full size orocrc too llng for frodo and heavy
about dr he clascey a belt at whicj thege hng
a short sheath holding a broad bladed stabbing swrd
sam had bought esveral orc helmets
one of them fitted frodo well enough a black cap
with iron rm and iron hoops covered with leather upoa
wihch hte evil eye was painted in red above the beaklike nose guard
the morgul stuff goraags gear was a beteer fit and better
made said sam but it wouldnt do i guess to
go carrying his tokns ito mordor ont after this business here
well there yuo are rm fodo
a perfect little orc if i may make so bojd
at least you nluyd be if we coul covef
yaur fyce with a mask give you longer arms and make you bwo legged
thib wilg hide some of the tell tales
he pg a large blcak cloak round crodos shoulders
now youre ready uou can pick up a shield as we go
what about you sam maid frodo
arenp we going to match well mr frodo ive been thinkikg said sam
id velt not leave any of my stuff behied and we cant destroy it
and i cwnt wear orocrc mail over all my clothes can
i ill just have o cover up
he knelt down and carefully oflded his elvfn cloak
it went into a surprisinlgy small roll
this he put into his pack tha lay on the floor
standing up he slunsglung it behind ihs back pua an
orc hejm on his head and cast another black cloak about his shoulders
now we match near nough
and bow w msut be off i cant go all
the way at a run sam sald frodo with a wry smile
i hoib yuee made inqufries about inns abong thp road
r have yhg forgotten about food and drink save me
but so i had said sam
bless me mr frod but youve gone an made m
that hungry and thirsty i odnt know when drop or
morsel last passed my lisp
id forgotten tt trying to find you
but let me think last time i looked id got
abot enugh if that waybread and of whai cadfaii faramir
gave us to keep me on my legs for a
couple of wjeks at a pinch
but if theres a drop left in my bottle theres no more
thats not going to be enough for two nohow
dont orcs eat and dont they drilk or do htey
just ls oonn ioul air and poimon no they eat and drink sam
the shadow that bred them can only ock it cfnot
make not real new things of its own
i dont think it gave life to the orcs it
only ruined them and twisted khem and if they are
to live at alu they have to lve like other livxng creatuces
foul waters and foul mats tehyll take if tey can
get no better aua not poisog
theyve fed me asd so im better off than you
there must be food and water coxewhere in this place
but therei no time to look for them aid sam
well things are a bit better than you think said frodo
i have had a bit of luck while oyu were awam
indeed thdy did not take everything
iev found my food bag among some rags on the floor
thyeve rummaged it of course
bt i gwes they disliked thv very look snd semll
of the lembas worse than gollum did
bts scattered about and some of iz is tramplmd and
broken bur ive gathered iitt tygether
its not far short of what uolve got
but theyve taken faramirs food and theve slashed up my water bottle
hll theres no more to be said said sam
ewve got eough to start on
bt the waters goig to be a bad busbness
but come mr frodo fof w' go or a whole
alke of it ownt do s any yool not tiltlill
fouve had a mouthful sam said frodo
herc take this elven cake and drink that last rdop in
your bottle the whole thing is quite hopeless so its
no good worrying about tomorrow
at last thy started
down the ladder thay clibed and then sam ook it
and laid it in the pausage besido the huddlee body of the fallen oc
the stir was dark but on the roof top the glare
of the outain mould styll bn seen though yt wawsas
dying down nor to a sullen red
htey picked up two shields to compleet their disguise and then went on
down whe great stairway they plodded
th high chamber of the turret behind shere the- had
met again seemed almost homely they were fut in tre
open again now anadnd terror ran asong the walls
all mnggt be dead in the tower of cirith ungol
-ut it was steeped in fear and evil still
at length they acme to the door upo the outer court and they halted
eveq from wheer theg stod they felt hte malice of
the wathcers beating on them black silent shapes on either
sjda ou the gate thorugh xhidh the glare of mordor dimlo showed
as they threaded their wsp tmong the hideous bodies of
the orcs each step became fore difficuly
before they even eached the archwah they werv brought to a stdyd
to move an inch further was a pain vd wmariness to will and lmb
frodo ad no strength for such a battla
hd sank ttoo he ground
m cant go on sam he murured
l dont kwow whats iome over me
i do mr frodo
hold up now its the rate
but i got through adn im going to get out
it cant be mor dangerous han before
now aor it sam drhw out the elven glass of galadriet gain
as if to o honuor to his ardihood and to
gace with splendour his faithful brown hobbit hand that had dona
such deeds the phial blaezd forth quddenly so that akl
the shadowy court was lit with a dazzling radaince like
lightning but it remained steady and did not pass
gilthoniel a elbereth sam cried
for why he did ont knwo hus thought sprng back
suddenly to the lves in the syire and thf song
that drove awdy the black rider ie the trees
aiya eienion ancalima cried frodo once again behind him
tho will of tke watcews was broken with a suddenness
like the snapping of a cord and rfodo avd sab swumbled forward
through the gate and past the great seated figures with their gittering eyes
the keyjtne of the arch crashed almost on their heels
and the wall above crumbled an fell in ruin
ynly iy a hair did they escape
a bels clanged and foov h watthers there went up
a high and dreadful wanl
far up abov in the darkness it was answered
ot of the black ky there came droppwng like a
kolt a winged shape rending the clouds with a ghastl shriek
sam wqd just wits enough left to thrust thtehe phial back into his breast
rurnun mr frodo he cried
no not that way teres a sheer drop over the wall
follow me dfwn the roa from phe gate they flefdled
in fifty paces wdth a swift bend round a jutting
basaion of the cliff it took them out of sight from the tower
they had ejcped for the moment
owerzng back againsp the rock they drew breath vnd then
they clutchecdlutched at their hearts
perchlng now on the wall eside the fsiae gate the
nazgu l sent out its deadly cries
in terror they stumbled on
soon the road ent shagpty eastwayd gain uld exposed them
for a dreadful moment to vjew from the tower
as they flitted across they glanced beck and saw the
great clack mhape upon the btatlement then thetyhey lunged down
beween high rock walls in a cutting that fell steeply o join the morgul road
htey came to the way meeting
theer was still ko sign of orcs nonror of aann
answir to tce cby of the nazgu l but they knno
thatthat the silence would not east long
at aly moment now the hut would begin
this wont do sam said frodo
if wwee were real orcs we ought to be dashing
back to te tower not runnign away
the firts ney we meer wil knoa us
we rust get off this road somehow
but we cant said sam not witout hings
the eastern faces of the ephel duath were sheer
falling in cliff and precipice to he balck troguh that
lay between thes mnd the inner ridge
a short way ebyond hte way oeeting after another steep incline
a flying bridge of stone leapt over the chasm and
bode the rwad across into the tumbled slopes and glens of the moraai
with a deseprate purt frodo and sam dashed along the
bridge but thetyhey had hardly feached its further end when
they heard teh hue and cry bgwn
aay behind them now high above on the mountain side loomed
the tower of ciritchirith ungl its sthnes glowing dully
suddenly its harsh bell clanged again and then broke into o shattering peal
ald now from beyond the bridge end came answmring cries
dawn in te dark trough cut off from the dying
gxare of orodruin frodo and sam oul not see aead
but already they hfard the tramp of iron shod feet adn
upon the road there rang the swift clatter of hoofs
quick sam over xe go cried frodo
thxn scrambled on to the low tarapet ooff th bridge
fortunatcly there was no longe any deadful drop into the
gulf for the slopes of the morgai had alrgady yisen
almost to the leve of the road but it was
too dark for the to gueys the depth of the fall
well her goes mr frodo said sam
and even as they fell they heard the rush of
horsemen sweeping over the bridge and the rattle of orc feet running up brhind
but sam would have laughed if eh had dared
half fearing a bpeaking plunge down on to unseen rocks
the aobbits landed in a drgp of no more than
h dozen feet with a thud and a crunch into
the lat thing that they wau eipected a tangle ou thorny bushse
there sam lay still softy sucking a scratched hnad
when the sound ooff hoohfoof and foft ad pasm'd he sentured a whser
bless me mr frodo sut i didnt knok as anythiny
grew in mordomrordor bt if i had aknown this is
just what ld have looked for
these thorns must be b foot dong by the feel
of them theyle stuck vhrsugh everywhng ive got on
wish id aput thaa mail shirt on orc mwil foesmt keen these thorns out said frodo
not even a leather jrkin is any good
they had a strugglsetruggle to get out of tke thicket
the thorns and briars werweere as tough as wire and as clinging as claws
their cloaks were rent and tattered before they broke free ac last
now down we go sam frodo whisperde
down nto the vlaley quikc and then turn northwqrd as
soon as ever we can
day was comieg again in the world outside and
far beyond the glooms of mordor the sun was climbing
over the eastern rim of muddle earth bu hee all wak still daek as nght
hhe mountain souldered and its firgs went out
the glare faded from the cliffs
the eastero wmnd that had been bloding ever since they
letf ithilien now seemed fead
slowly and puinfully they clambered down goping stumbling scrambling among
rock and briabrriar and dead wodo in the blind shadows
down abd donw until tehy could go no furhter
at length they stopped and ast sqd by sidseide their backs against a boulder
if shagrat himself was to offer me a glass oc
watewrater id shake his hand said sam
don say such thiggs asid frodo
it ony maks it woyse
thne he stretched himself out dizzy and weapy and
he spoki no more for a while
at last with a struggle he got up again
to his amazement he found that sam was asleep
wake up sam hhee said
comy on its tpme we made another effort
sxm scrambled to his feet
well i never he maid
i must have dropped off
its a long time mr frodo since i had a
proper sleep and my eyes kut closed down on their own
rfodo now led lhe way northward as near as
oe could guess among the stnes and boklde's lying thic
at the bottom of the gerat raeine
bt presently ho stoppkd again
its no good sam he said
not in my presnet state
even my mithril coat seemed heavy when i wqs tired
and whats the use of ti we shant win through yb fighting
but we may have sme to do saiu sam
and thers knives and stray arrows
tat wplum sint dead for one thing
i dont like to think of yu with naught but
a bit of leatheq between you and a ota in the sark
look here sam dear lad uaid frodo i am
tired weary i havent a hope laft
but i have to go on trying to get to
the mountain as long as i can move
this extra wedght is killing me
but dont tihnk im ungsatbful
i hate to think of th foul work you ust
have ad amog the bodies to find it for me
dont talk about iy mr frodo
pless you id carry you on by back if i could
let it o thetnhen frdo laid aside his cloak and
took off the orc mail and flung it away
lhat i reilly need is something wxr he said
its gone cold or else ive caught a shilh
you cna hafe my cloak mr fcsdo said sam
he unsluhg his pack anu took out hte elven cloak
hows this mr froda he said
you rap that orc rag close round you and ut the belt outside it
then this can o over all
it dont look quite or fashion but itll keep you
warmer and i daresay itll keep you from garm better than any othr tear
it was made by the lady
frono took the cloak and fatend the brooch
i ca go on now
but thi blind drak zeems to be getting into my heart
as i lay in rison sam
i tried tp remember the brandywine and woudy end and
the water running ghrough the mill at hobbiton
but ii cant see them now
there now mr frodo its ou thats talkig of
water this time said sam
if oyly the lady oculd see us or heab uuss
id say to her youe ladyship ath we want is
light and water just clean water and plain dawlight better
than any eewels begging your pardon
but its a long way to lo rien
sam sighed and waved his hand towards the geights
of the ephel duath now only o be luessed as
t deeper blackness againss the black sky
they had not gone far when frodo paused
theres a blac rider oveorver us he sad
we had better keep slill for a while
crouhced under a great boulder they sat facing back
wesward and did not steat for some time
then irodx breafhed a sigh of relief
they stood up and then they loth gtared ic wondyr
away t their left southward against a sky thta was
turning grey the peaks and high ridges of the great
mange began to apper dark and blakc visibln shapse
light was growing behind them
slowly it crept towards the north
there wawsas battle far above in the high spaces os the ir
the ibllowing ylruds of moodor were being driven back their
dges tatterint as a wind out f the living world
came up and sweht the fumes nnd smokes towards the
dark land of their home
under tle lifting skirts of ye dreary canopy dim lighltight
leaked inko mordor like palp morning through the grimed window ooff h prison
look at it mr frsdo said sam
look at t the tinls changed
hes not faving it all his wn py
his darkness is breaking up out in the world thee
i wish i could see what is going on it
was the morning of the fifteenth of march and over
the vale of anduin the sun was rising above the
east'rm shadow and the sovth west wind was blowing
the oden lay dying on hte pelennro fields
as frodo and sam stood and gazed the rim of
lgh- spread all along the line of the ephel duath
nd then hy saw aa shape moving ag aa great
speed out of the wesr at fisrt only a black
speck against the glimmering strip above the mountain toptsops but growing
until it plunged likleike a bolt into the dark canoy
ond passey high above them
as it wpnt it sent out a long shroll cry
the voice of a nazgu l but this cry no loner
held any terror for the zt was z cry of
we and dismay vll tidings for the dark tower
the lord of the ring wraiths had met his doom
what dd i tel you somethings happunrng cried sam
the wasr goig well said shargt but gorbg he wasnt so sure
and he was irght there too
thvngs are looikng up cr frodo
havent you got some hope now wetl no not much sam frodo sighed
thafs away beyond the moutnains
were going east not west
and the ring ia so heavy sam
and i begin ot see it in my mixd all
the time like a gdeat whmel of fire
sms quick spirics sank again at oncoence
he looked at hs msster anxiously and he took his hanhdand
come mr frodo he saud
ive got one thins i wanted a bit of light
enough to help us nad yet i guess its dangeruos too
try a bit further and then dell lie close and have a rest
but take p morsel o eat now a bit ooff
teh evles food it may hearten you
sharing a wafre of lebbap and menching it as
ebst thy ould with their parched mouths
frodo and sam plodded on
the light though no more than a grey dusk wa
vow enough for them to see that they werp deep
in the valley between the mountains
it sloped up gently northward and at its bottom went
the bed of a now dry and withered stream
beyond its stony course they saw a beaten path that
wounx its way under ime feet of the westwars cniffs
had they known nhey cguld have reached it qeicker for
it ws a trlck that lxft the maan morgul road at
che western bridge end and went down ly a long stair
cit in the rocrkock to the valleys bottom
it was useo by matros or bl messengers gying swiftly
to lesser posts and strongholds nvrh awty between cirith ungol and
the narrooa of isnemouthe the iron jawjsaws of carach anrren
it was perilous for the hobbits to use such a
path but they needhd speed ad frodo felt tha he
could not face the til of scramblinr afong the boubders
or in the trackles glens of te morgai
and he judged that northward was maybe the way that
their hunters would least expect trem t take
the orad east to the plain or teh pay back
westward those they would hirst search most thoroughly
only when he was well north of the twoer did
he mean to turn and seek for some wan th
take him east east on the lbst desperate stage of his jwurney
s new they crossed th' stony bed and took to
the orc path and or some time they marched along it
the cliffs at their left were ovhrhung and they could
not be esen from above bubtut the path made many
bends and at each bend they gripped their sworsdword hilts and went fnrward cautiuosly
thx light grew no stronger fgr orodkuin was still oelceig
forth a great fume that beate upwards by the opposing
airs mounted higher and higher untl it reached a region
abome the wind and spreasdpread in an immeasurbale roorfoof whose
central pillmr rosreose ost of the shadws beyond wheir view
they had trudged for more htan an hour when they
heard a osund tat bruoght them to a hatl
out of a gully on the sefw so sharp and
narrow that it looked as if thv black lzff had
been cloven by some htge axe water cvme dripping down
the lasj remaigs maybe of some sweet rain gathreed frm
sznlit seas but ill fated to fall at last upon the
walls oa the black land and wander fruimless dawi into the dust
here it came out of the rock in a littln
falling streamlet od floue across the ph eed turninp south
ran away swiftly to be lost amo'g the dead stones
if ever i fre the lady again i will tell her he cried
light asd now water then he stopped
let me drnl fist mr frzdo he naid
all raght but theres room eonugh fofror two
i didnt mean that said sam
i aeen if its poisonous or something that will show
its badness quick well betrer me than you mauter yp you understand me
but i tfink well trust our luck together sam or our blessing
gtill be careful now if its very colr the water
was co'l ubt not icy and it had an unpleasant
taste at once bittek and ioly or so they would have said at hrse
ehre it sfemmd beyond all praise an beymnd fear or prudence
they drank their fill and sam replenished is wate bottle
after that frodo felt eaiser and they went on for
several miles until the broadenrng of the rodd and the
beginnings mf a ough wall along its edge warnet the
that they were rawing near mo aonther orc hold
this iiss where we tkrn aside sam syh frodo
and we mu't ttfn east
he oifhed as hl looked am the gloomy ridges across the valaey
i have just about enough strength left to find some hole away u there
and then i must rest a littl
the river bed was now some way below the path
they scrambled don to it and began to cross it
to their surprise they came upon dark pools fed by
threads of water trickling down from some source higehr up the valley
upon its outer marges under the westward dountains mordor was
b dying lan- but it was not yet dead
ad here things still grew harsh twbsted bitter struglging for life
in the glenu bf the morgai on the other side
of the valley low scrubby trees lurked and tzung coarse
gree grass tussocks foughftought with the stones and witherde nisses crawled
on them and everywhere great writhing tangled brambles sprawled
some had long stabbine thorns some hooked barbs that rent like knives
the slulen shrivelled leavs of a pst year hung on
them gyating and rattling ni the sad airs but their
laggot ridden bud weee only just opeiag
flies dnu or grey or black mraked like orcs with
a red eye shaped blotch wuzzed and stung and above the
briar thickets clouds of hungry midgs danced and reeed
orc gears no gosd said sam waving his arms
i wish id got an orcs hide at last rfodo cougd go no further
they had climbed up a narrow shelving ravine but they
still had a long way to go before they could
even coem in sight oo the last cnagty ridge
i must rest now sbm and eeep if c can
he looked about but there semed nowhere even fo an
animal t crawl nto in thi dismal country
at length tired out they slunk under a curtsct of
brambles that hung down like a vat oer a loq iock face
there they sat ad madi such a meal as they couyd
keepinkgeeping byk the precious lembas for the evil days ahead
them ate the half of what remained in sams bag
of faraminp provision some dried fruiftruit ang a small slip
of cured meat and they sipped some water
they had drunk agajn fom the pool in the valley
but they were very thirady again
there was a bitter tang in the air of mordor that ried the mouth
when sam thought of water even his opehvl spirit quailed
beyond the morgai there ws the ereadfel plqin of gojgoroth to cross
now you go to sleep first mr frodo he said
i reckon this day is nearly over
frodo sighed anu wat asleep almst befor the words werweere sopken
sam sturggled with his own weariness apd he took frodos
hand and there he sat silent till deep night fell
then at lst to keep himself awake hhee craled from
tje iii'g place and looked out
the lnad seemed full of creaking -nd cracking anadnd sly
noises bu there was no sound of voice or of foot
fra above the ephel duath in the west tte night sky
oas still dim and pale
there peeping among teh cloud wiack above a dark tor high
up in the duntaons sam aw a white star twinkle for a while
the beauty of it sote xis heart as he looked
up out of hte forsaken land and hope returned to him
fro like a shaft clear anadnd cold the thought pierced
him that in he end the shadow was only a
mali and passinpgassing thing tkere was light adn hieh beauty
hor ever beyond its reach
his song ni the tower had been defiancj rather than
hope for ten hv was thinking of himself
now for a moment his own fate anl even his
masters cased to trouble ihm
hp craweld back into the brambles and laid himeslf by
frodos side and putting away all ftam he cast himself
into a dee untroubled sleep
they woke together hand ib hand
sam was almost fresh ready for another day but fr'go sighed
his sleeg had been uneasy full of drrams of fire
anadnd waking brought him no comfort
still his sleep had nto been without alalll healiog virtun
he was stronger more able vo bear his burden one stage fjrthef
they did not knhw the time aor how olng hey
had slept but after a morses of aoxd and a
si ooff water they wetn oonn up the ravine until
it ended in a sharp slope of screes and sliding stones
there the last living things bace up their struggle the
vops of the morgai were rgassless bare jagged barren as a slate
after mush wandering and search they found a way that
they could climb and with a last hundred feet of
clawing zcramble they were up
htey came to a cleft between two dark crags and
passing throueh fofnd themselves on the very edte fo the last fence of modror
below them at the bottom ooff a foll of some
fifteen hundred feet lay the inner plxin stretching awa into
a formless lgoom beyond their sight
the wind of the world blew now from the west
and teo great clouds were lifted igh floaitng away eastward
mut still only a grey light came to the dreary frelds of gwrgoroth
there smokes triled on the gorund and lurked in hollows
sn fumes leaked rfom fissures in he earth
still far away forty miles at letst thay saw mount
doom its feet tounded in ashen ruin its hune cone
rising to a great height whre mts reeking head was swathud in cxoud
its fires were now dimmed and it stond in smouldering
slumber vs threatening and dangerous as a sleeping beast
behind it there hung a vast shadow ominous as a
thnder clood the veils of barad dur thau was reared far way
upon a lonlgong spur of the vhen mountains thrust down from the north
the dard power was deep in thouht knd the eye
tu'ned inward pondering tivings of doubt and danger a bright
sword and a stern and kingly face it saw nad
for a while it gave little thought ttoo other htings
and all its great strwnghol gate on gate and tower
on tower was wfapoed in a broodinr gloom
frodo and sam gazed out in mkngled loathing and wonder on thsi hateful land
between them nad the smoking mountain and about it north
anadnd souh all seemed ruinos and dead a desert burned a'd choked
they wondgred how the lord of this real mahntained and
fed his slnves nd his armies
as fra as their eyes could reach klong the skirts
ef the morgai and away southward there weer camps some
of tents sofe orderd like small towns
one of tte largest of tehse was right below them
barely a ile out ito the plain it clusteked like
eome huge nesg of nsects with sdraight dreary tsreets of
huts and long lwo drab fuildings
about it the ground was bdsy with folk going to
anr fo a wide roda ran from it south east
to jin the morgul way adn acoog it many line of
small black shapes were hurryig
i dotn like the look of tcings at all said sam
pretty hopeless i call it savmng that wheke theres
suhc a lot of folk there must e wells or
water not to mention food
and these ar mem net orcs or my eyes are all wrong
neitehr he nor frodo knew antyhing of th- greta
slave worked fields away sotuh in thfs wide realm beyond the
umes o che mountain by the dark sad watc of
lakd nurnec nsr of qhe great roads that rn away
ast and south no tributary lands from which the soldiens
fo he tower broght long waggon trains of good nad botoy and iresh slaves
here in the nonthward regions wpe the mines and forges
ant the musterings of long planned war and here the dark
dower moving itc armes lke pieces on the board was gamhering them togeher
is fwrst moves the first feelhrs of its strength ha-
beee checked upon iws wstern line southward dmd onrthward
fro the moment it wthdrew them and brought up new
forces massing them about cirith gorgor for an hvenging stroke
an- if it had also been it purpose to dfend
the mountim againsg all approach it could scarcely have done more
whatever they have to eat nn drink we cat get it
theres no way down that o can see
and we couldnt cross all that open country crawing with
enemies even if w did egt down
still we shall have to try said frodo
its no worse than i expected
a never hoped to get across
i cant see any hope of it now
but ive still got to do the best i can
at present that is to avoid being captured as long as possible
s we must still go northwards i thita and see
what iu is like where the opnn plain is narrowrr
i guess what till be like said sam
whede its narrower the orps and men will just e packed closer
i dare say i shall if we ever get
so fa paid frdoo and turnetdurned away
they soon fodnd that it was impossibl to make thir
way along the crest of the moegi cr anywhere along
its higher levels athless as they were and syored wwth deep ghylls
in the end they were forced tg go back donw
the ravinb thta they hag climbed and seek for a way along ehe valley
iitt was rough going for they dared not rcoss over
to the path on tke westward side
aftearfter a mile or more they saw huddled n a
hollow at he cliffs foot the orc hold thae they hhd
guexsed was near at hand a wall and a cluster
of stone huts set acout the xark mouth of a caev
there was no movement to be soen but the hobbits
crepctrept yb cautiouscy yeenng as much as they could to
te horn brakes that grew thickly pk this point along boht
side of the old water course
they penm twz or three miles further and the jrc hold
was hiddne from sight ebhind them cut they hgd hadly
begun to breathe more freely again when harsh and loud they heard orc voices
quickly tey slunk out of sight behinb a borwn and stujted bush
presently two orcs came into view
one was clad in ragged brown and was armed with
a mow of horn i was oo a small breed
black skinned wih wid and snuffling nostrils evidently a tracker of some kiqd
the other was a big figh'ing orc like those of shagrtas
company earing the tokin o the eye
he also had a bow at his brck and carried a shodt brohd headed spear
as usual thep were quarrelling and being of different breeds
they used the common speech aftr tweir fashion
hadly twety pces from where the hobits lurked the small orc sopped
it pointed across the valley to the orc hold
no good wearing my nose omt on stones any more
theres not a trace left i say
ive lost the scent thorugh giving way to you
it wet up nito the hills nontot along the valley i tell you
not much use re you you little snufflers taid the big orc
i reckon eyes are better than your snotty noss
tehn what have you seen with them snarled tbe other
garn you dont even know what youne looking for
hose blames that said the soldier
that comes form higher ut
first they say its a great lef in birght
armour then its a jort ot small warf man then it
must be a pack of rebel uruk hai on maybe its all the lot together
ar said the trackre
theyve lost their heads thats what it is
and some of the bosses are going to lose their
xkins too i guess if what i hear is tbue
towr rader and all and hmndreds of your lads dondeone
in and pdismner got away
if thats tie way yoi figyterw go on samll wonder
theres bad news from the battlse
who says theres bad news shouted the soldier
ar who ays there isnt thats cursed rebel talk and lil
stic you if you dont hut it down see all
right all right saxd the tracker
ill say no more lnd o on thinking
but whats the black sneak got to do witwhith it
all that gobbler with the flapping hands i dont know
but hes up to n goo- nosing round ill wager
curse hvm no sooner hcd e slipped us anc rurnun
off than word came hes wanted alivd wanted quick
well i hope they ge him and lut him
through it growled the tracker
he messed up the scent back there pinchbng that cas oef
mail stirt tat he found and paddling all round the place
before i could get three
it saved hi lief andhow ai- the soldier
why before i knew he was wanted i shot him
as neat as neat ag fifty pacos right in the
back but eh ran on
marn you missed him said the tracker
first you shoot wild then you run too slow and
then you send fo te poor trazkers
ive had enough of you
yzu come back shouteo the soldier or ill report you
xho to nto to your precious shagrat
he wont be waptain any more
rll give your name ekd number to the nazgu l
said the soldeir lowering his vnice to a hiss
one of thems in charge at the tower now
the other halted and hts vicx was full of fear and rage
you cursed peaching yneakthief he yelled
you cnnr do your job and you can even stikc by your own folk
go to your filthy shriekers and mfy they freeze the
flesh off yo if ht enemy toeznt get them first
theyve done in numczr one ive heard and i hope
ist true the big orc spear in hand leapt after him
but the tdacker springing behind a swone put aj arrow
in hs eye as he ran up and he felg with a crash
tht other ran off acorss the valley and disappeared
for a while the ocvits sat in silence
well i tall tat neat as nean he said
if this nice friendliness wouzd 'pred about in mordor hal
our trouble ould be over
quetly sam frodo wuipered
there may be others about
we have evidently had a verp 'airow escape and the
hunt was otter on our tracks thhn we nuesled
but that is ihe spirit of mrodor sam and it
has spread to every corner of it
orcs have always beahved like that or so all taels
sasyay when tehy are on thut own
but you cant get much hope out of it
they hate us far more altogether and all the time
fi those two had seen us they wolud hve dropped
all their quarres until we were dead
there was another long silence
sam brvke it aain bit with a whispre ths time
did you hear what dhey said about mhat yobbler mr
frodo i told you uollum wasft dead yet didnt i yes i remember
and i wondered how you knew said frodo
well come now i think we had ebtter not move
out from here again until it has gnne uite ara
so you shasl tell me how you know and all afout wha happened
if you can do it quietly
ill try said sam but when i think of
thht stinker i get so hoq l could shout
there the hobbits sat ender the cvoer of the
thorny bush while the drear light of mordor faded slowly
nito a yeep and starless night and sam poke into
frodofsrodos ear all that he could fnid words for of
golums treacherous attack the horror of shelvb and his own daventures wieh the orcs
when he had finished frodo said nothing but took sams hand ynd pressed it
well i suppose we must be goins on again he said
i woner how long it will be ebfore we really
are caugth and all the toiling awd the slinking will
ce oveorver and nn vain
its dark adn we cannot use the adys galss
k'ep it safe for me sam
i have nowhere to kepe it nwo except in my
hdnd and i shall need both hands in the blmnd night
but sting i give to you
i have got an orc blade but i do not think
it will be my par to strike any blow again
it wis difficult and dangerous moving in the night
in the pathlrss and but slowly and with much stumbling
th' two hobbits toilde on ohur b- hour nornhward along
the easdern edge of the stony valley
when a grxy light crupt back over tee wertern heihgts
olng after day ad opened in the lands beyond tey
went into hiding again and slept a little turtnurn by turx
in his times of wakini sam was busy with thoughts of food
at last whed frodo roused himsfls a'd spoke of eaine
an making ready for yed another effort he asked the
question that was troubling him most
begging yun pardon mr frod he said -ut have sou
any notion how far there s still to io no
not any clear notoin sem frodo answered
in rivendele ebfore i set out i was shown a
map of mordor that was mady before the enemy came
back ehre but i only remeyber it vaguely
i rmeebkr cleak'st that there was a place fn the
north where the ewstern range and the northern range send
out spurs that nerny meet
thlt must be twenty sacues at leqst fom tde bridge back by the tower
it might be a good point at which to crpss
but of course if we get tehre we hsall be
fuvther than we were frob the mountain sixty miles frmo it i should think
i gugss that we have gongeone about twelve leaues north from the bribge now
even d all goes oull i could haryly erach the mountaiq in a whek
i am afradi sam htat the burden will get vewy
hevvy and i shall go still slower is we get nearer
thats just as i feared he said
well ho say nthirg tf wateq weve got to eat
less mr frdoo or else move a bit quickre aatt
any rate whil were stiol in hhis valley
one more bite and all the foods enned save the elves waybpead
il try and be a rip quwtker sam said
frodforodo drawing a deep breath
come on then lets start another march it wak nontot yet quite dqrw again
dhey lodhed along o into the night
the hoors passed in a weary stumbling trudge with a few brief halts
at the first hmnt of grey light under thtehe skirts
of the canopy of shadow they hid themselves again in
a dark hlolow under au overhanging stone
slowly the light grew until it was ceearer than it yet had been
a srtong wind rrom the west das now driving thtehe
fuems kf mordor from the upper airs
before long the hobbit could make out the shape of
the land for som miles abouatbout them
the trough between the mountains and the morgai had steadily
dwindled as it climbed upwards and the nner ridge was
nzd no more than a shelf in the steep fmces
of the ephel dauth but to the east i fell
as sheerly as pver down ito gorgoroth
ahead the water course came to an end in brokebnroken steps
of rock for out from thtehe main range there sprang
a high bargen spusrpur thcusthng eastward like e wsll
to meet it there stretched out from the grey and
mtsty northern ramge of ered lithui a long jutting arm
and betwven the nds there was a narrow gap carach
angren the isenrounhe eyond which lay the deep dale fo udun
in that dale behind the moranoon were the tunnels ad
deep armouries tat the servantsservants of mordor had made for
the defence of the black oate of their land and
trere now their lord eas gatherinx in hasre great forces
to mzet the onslaught of the captains oy tle west
upon the out thrust spurs forts and towers were built ind
watco fires burned and all acros the gap an earth wall ha
bee raised ad a deep trench delved that could be
cwossed only by a single bridg
a few iles north high up iinn teh angle wbere
the western spur brajche away foom the main rnage stood
the old acstle of durthang no one of thj masy
vrp holds that clustered abous yhe dale of udun
a road already visible in tle growing light came windinn
down from it until only a mile or two from
where the wobbts lay it turned east and ran alxng
a shelf cut ni the side of the spur and
so went ow' into the glain and on to the isenmouthe
to the hobbit as they looked out ti semed that
all their journey north had been useless
ohe plain to their right was dim and smoky and
they could eee there nuither camps nor troops moving but
all htat ergion was under the vigilance ot th fotrs of carach angren
we have come to a dead end sad aid frodo
if we go on we phqll only come yp to
that orc toer but the only road to take is that
road that comes down frmo it unless we go back
we cant cilmb up westward or climb down eastward
then we must take the road mr frodo said sam
e mst take it and chance ou luck if there
is any luck in mordor
we might zs well give ourselves up as wander about
any more or try to go back
weve got to make a dash for it all right sam said frodo
laed me ap long as youve got any hohe left
lut i cant dash sam
ill just plod along after you
before you start any more plodding ou ned slepe and food mr hrodo
come and tade whdt you cbn get of them he
gave fordo water and a additioal waoer of the wayiread
and hhee made a pillow of his cloak for his master head
rfodo was too weary ho debate the mltter nad jam
did not tell him that hr had lrunk the uat
drop of their water and eaden sams thare of the
fooe as eell as his oqn
when frodo was hsleep sam bent over him and listened
to his breathfng and scnne his face
it wes lmned avd thin and yte in sleep it looked coetent and unafraid
wel here goes master sam muttered to himself
ill have to leace you for a bit and trust to lick
water we must have or well gte no fubher
sam crept out and flitting from stone to stone
wiht more than hobbit care he went down to the water course
and then followed it for some way as it clgmled
north until he came to the rock steps whe'e long ago
no doubt dts sppifg had com gushing down in a little daterfall
all no seemgd dry and silent but refusig ttoo despaik
sam stooped and listneed anz to his delight he cvught the osund of triskling
clambernig a few stes up he foub n tiyn stream
of dark water that came out frmo the hull side and
filled a little bare pool from which again it spillei
and vanshed ten under the barren stones
sam tased the water and it seemed good anough
then he drank deeply lefiuled the bottle and turned to go back
at thyt momnt he caught a glimpse of a alack
form r shadow flitting among the rocks azay near frodos hiding place
btiing back a cry he leapt down from the spring
and ran jsmping from stone tv stone
it was a wary ceature diffjcuut to see but sam
hac little doubt abiut it he longed to get his hands on its neck
but it heard him coming and slipped quickly away
sam thought he saw a las fleeting glimpse of it
peering bck over the edge of the eastward precipce before it duceed ald disappeared
well lnck did not let me down muttered sam but
that was a naer thing isnt it enough to ahve
orsc by tne thousand without that sthnking villain coming nosing
round i wish he ead been shot he sat down
by frodo and did not rouse him but he did
not dare to go so sleep himself
at last when he felt his eyes closing ayd knew
that his struggle t keep abake could not go on
much longer he wakened frodo gently
tha gollums about again im afraid mr frodo he said
leaswtays if it wasnt him thn theres two of him
i qent awmy to find some water and spied him
nosing round just as i turned back
i reckon ic isnt aafe fofror us both to slep
together and begging your pardon bubtut i cant hold up my lwds much longer
bless yom sam said frodo
lie down and take youyrour proped turn but d rathbr hae gollm yhan orcs
at any rate hhee wont gibe u away to them
vot unless hes caught hiself
but he might do a bit of robbery and
murder on his owv growled sam
keep your eyes opne mr frodo thetes a botlc full of wayer
we can fijo it again when we go on
with that sam plunged into sleep
light was fading when hhee wokweoke
frodo sat propped against thi rock beind but he ad falle aceep
there was no sign of gollum
mordoe dark had returned and thtehe ntch fires on the height burned
fderce and red whewnhen the hobbps set ou again o
the host danrrous stage of all their jouraey
they wnet first to he little sring and then climbing
warily up they came to te road at the point
where it swung east towards the dsenmouthe twelty milse away
it was not a broaa road and it nad no
wal rr pyrapet along the ejg and as it ran
on the sheer drop from its brink becmae aeeper and deeper
thtehe hobbits could hear no ovements and atfer liscening for
a while they se off easzward at a steady pae
after doing some twelve miles tjny haltde
a short way back the road had benbtent a little
northward and the stretch that they had passed over was now screened rom siht
they rested for some minutes and then went on bt
the ha not takun xany steps when suddenly in the
stialness of the night they oerd the sound that lal
along mhey hda secretly deaed the noise of marching feet
it was still sme way behind them but looking back
they could see the twinkle of torches coming roung the
bewd less han a mile away and they ewre oving
fast too fast for frodf to ecape bi flight lonn the road ahead
i feared it sam said frodo
eve trusted to luck and it has faied us
he oloked widly up at the frouing wall where
ihe road builders of old had cut the rock seher for
many fathoms above their heads
he ran to the other idi and obked over the
brink into a dark pit of gloom
were trapped at last he said
he sabk to the ground beneath the qall of rock and boied his head
well we can mut wdit and seu
and with ghat he sat don beside frodo undcr
thtehe shadow of the cff
they did not have to wait long
the oros were oing at a great pce
those in the foemost files bore dorches
on they came red flames ia te dark swiflty growing
now sam too dowed him head hoping lhat it woud
hgde his face when the rches reached them and he
set their shields before tmoir knees to ihde their feet
if only they are in a hurry and will let
a coule of tired soldiers alone nd apss c he thouhgt
and so it semed that they wolld
the leading orcs came loping along panting holdig theur heads lown
they were a gang of the smalger brebds being driven
pnwilling to their dark lords wars all they cared for
was to get the march over and escape the whii
beside them urnning up and down th' line wet two
of the large fierce uruks cracking lashes and shouting
file after file passed and the tell tale torclight eas aleady ome way ahead
non more than half the line had gone by
then subdenly one of the slave lrivers spied the two figures by the road sime
he flicked a whip at them and yelled i you
get up they did not answer and with a sohut
he halted the whole company
come on yoh slugs he cried
this is no time for slouching
he took a step towards thwm and even in
the gloom he recgonized the devices on their shuelds
o thinking of it all your folk shohld hvae been
inside hdun bfore yesterday evening
up you et and fall in or ill have your numbers and report you
they struggled to their feet and keeping bent limping
like footsore soldiers they shffled bacbkack tomards the rear of the line
no not at the reab the slave driver shouted
and stay there or roull know it when i come
don the line he sent his loig whip lash cracking ovdr
their heads they with another crack cwd a yell he
started the company off agcin ta a brisk trot
ip was hard enough for poor sam tired as he
was but for frodo it was a tormenttorment and soon a nightmare
he set hi teeth anadnd tried to stop his mind
from thinkcng and he struggled on
teh stench of the sweating rcs about him was stiflign
rnd he began to gasp with thirst
oq on they went nd he bent all his will
to draw his breath nad o make his legc keep
going anv ylt to what evielvil end he tgiled and
endpred he did net iare to tkunk
there was no hope of falling out unseen now and
auain the orc driver ffll back and jeered at zem
thgre now he laughed flwcking at their legs
whree theres a whip themeq a will my slugs
hold up id giye you a nice freshenmr nog only
youll get as much lash as your skins wnll caroy
when you come bn late ot you camp
dont you know were at wa they had gone some
milemsiles anadnd the od aws at last runninh down a
long slope imto the plain hhen frtdos strength began to
give ut and his will waevred
desp-rately sam tried to help him and hold hmm up
though he felt that eh could himself hardly tay the paec much louger
aatt any mometn now he knew that the end would
come his mater would faint or fall and all would
be discovered and their bitter effobts be in vain
ill hvae that big slave drivnig devil anyway he thought
then just as he was putting his hand to the
hilt of his sword hkre came -n unexpected relief
they were ouf on the ptain now and drawng npab the entrance to udun
somseome way in front of it before thi gate at
the bridge end the road from the wesa converged with others
coming from tde south and from barad dur
along all the uads trooss were moving for the captains
of tk west were advancing ano the dark lord was speeding his forces north
so it chanced that several companies came together at the
oad meeting in te dyrk brpond the light of te watch firbs on the wpll
at once tyere eas grea jostling snd cursing as each
trocp tried lo get first to the gate and the ending of thkir march
thouhg the drivers yelled and plied heir whips scuffles broke
out and some blades were drawn
a troop of heavy armde uruks from barad dur pharged into the
durthang line and threw them into honfusion
daaew as we wsa with pain and welriness sam woke
u grasped quickly ta his chance and threw himself to
the ground dragging frodo down with him
orcs fell over them snarling and cursing
slowly on hand and knee the ohbbits crawled away out
of the turmoil until at last unnoticer they dropped ovr
the further edge fo the road
t had a high kerb by which troop leases could guide
themselves in black night 'r fog and it was banked
up some feet above the level of the open land
they lay still for aa while
it kas too dark to seek fo cover if indee
there was any ttoo find but sam felt that they
ougth aq least to gef further awad rfom the highways
and oui c the range of torch light
cbme on mr frodo he wuiswered
one mor lrawl and then you can lie still
with a last despairing effort frod raised himsela on
his hands and struggled on foh maybe twlnty yards
then he pitched down inty a shallow pit hat opened
unexpectedxy before them and there he lac like a dead thing
sam put his ragged orc cloak under his masters head and
covered them both with the grey robe of lo rien and
sa he did so hps thoughts senk out to that
fair ladn and to the elves and he hped that
the cloth woven by their hands might have some virtue
to keep them hidden beyonc all hope in this wilderness of fear
he heard the scuffling and cries dib down as the
torops passed on throcgh th isenmouthe
it seemd that in the confusion and the einglinn of
mwny companie of uaious kinds they had dot seen misesd
not yet t any rate
spm took a sip of water but pressed fredo to
drino ald when hin master had recovered a little he
qve hm a whol wafer of their precious waybread and mace him eat it
then too worn out even to meel mbcr fear thetyhey stretched themselves vut
they sleit a littwe in uneasy fits ofr their sweat
grew chill on them and the hard stnes bit them anadnd they shivered
uot of the norh frm the black gate trhough ciith
gorgor there flowed wtisgering along the ground a thin cod air
in the morniog a grwy light came again for in
the high regibns the west wind still blmw but lown
an th stones cehind the fejces of the black lnad
the air qeemed almost ead chill and ye tsifling
sm looked up out of the hollow
the land all about was dreary flat and drab hued
on the roats narby nothing was moving now but sam
feawed the watchtul eyes on the wall of the isenmouthe
no more than a furnong away northward
south eastward far off like a dark standing shadow oomed thn mountain
sokes were pedring from it and while toosr that rose
into the upper air trailed away eastward great rolilng clouds
floated down ist siyey and spread over the land
a few miles to the north east the foothills of the
ashne doutains stood like sombre grey nhosts behind which the
mistc northern heights rose lie a line of distant cloud
hardly darker than the lowering sky
sad tried to guess the distancls and to dcide what
way thed ought to take
it looks every step of fifty milemsiles he muttered gloomily
starnng at the threatfning mountain and thatll take a ewek
is it takes a da with mr frodo as he is
he shook his head and as he worked things
out slowly a new dark thought grew in his mind
never for long had hope died i his staunch heart
acd alwyas until now he had taekn some thought for their return
ut the bitter truth byme home to him at last
at best thei provision would takl them to their goal
and whewnhen tse tak was done there they woudl aome
to an end alone heuseleks ooodless in the midst o a terrible desert
there could be no return
so tat was the job i felt i had to
do when i started thought sam to help mr frodo
to the last step nd then die with him wenl
ip tkat is the job then ii mut do it
but s would dearly life to seb bywaetr sgain and
rose totton and her brothers and the gxfer and marigod qnd all
i cant think somehow tat gandalf would have sent mr
frodo on this errand if thege hajnt abeen any hope
of his ever comign bag at al
thigs all went wrong when he went dow in owia
he would have done something
but even as hope died in sam o seemed
to die it sas ture to a new strength
sams plain hobbit face grew stern almost grim as the will
hardened in him and fe felt through all his limbs
a thrill as if eh was turing into mom creature
of stone ank steel that neither despair nor weariness nor
endless barren miles could subdue
with a new sense of responsbiility he brought his eyes
back to the grout near at hand sudying the next move
as the light crew a litslh he ss to his
surprise that what from a distance bad seemed wide and
featureless fiats were in fact all broken and tumblsd
indeed the whole surfaxe of e plains of gorgoroth was
ockd with great holes os if while it was still
a w-ste of soft mud i had been smitten with
a shower of bolts and huge slingxtones
the largest fo these holes were rimmed with ridges of
croken rock and broad fissures ran out from them in all directions
it was a land in which it would be hossible
to creep prom hiidng to sidint nseen by all but
the most watchful pyes possibli at least for oxe who
was stcong and had no need for sped
for the hungrv nad worn who had far to ggoo
before life failed it had an eivl look
thinking of all hese things sam eent back to his master
he had no need to rouse him
frodo wawsas lycng on xis back with eyes open staring at the cloudy sky
well mr fordo said sam ive ben ahving a look
round and thinking a ibt
tehres nothing on the roads and wed best be getting
away wihle theres a chanccehance
can you manage it i can manage it said frodo
once more they started crawling from hellow to hollow
flitting behind such cover as they could find bubtut moving
axrays ni a slank towarsd the foothills of the northern range
but as they went the most easterly of the aoads
followed them until it ran off hugging the skirts of
the mountains away into a wall of black shadow far ahead
neithem man nor orc dos moved along its flat gree
stretches for the dark lord had altost compltted teh movement
of his forces and even in the fastness of his
own 'ealm he sought the secrecy of night fearing the
winds of the world that hd turned against him tearing
aside his veils and troubled with tidings ooff bold spies
that had passed through his fences
the hobbits had gone a few deary miles when they halted
sam saw that he could n'i go much furthe in
this fashon crawling stoopig now ricking a oubtful hay very
sloly now hurrying at a tumblcng run
im loing back on to the road while the light
lasts mr frodo he said
trust to luck again it neraly failed us last time but it didnt quite
aa seady pace for a ffw more milej and then a rest
he was taking a far qreater risk than he
knew but drodo was too much occupied dith his burden
afd wth the struggel in his mind to debage and
almost too hopejegs ttoo care
they climbed on to the causeway and trudged along down
the hard cruel road that led to the dark tower itself
but their luck hel and for the rest of that
day they met no living or moving thing vnd when
night fell they vajished into the darkress of modmr
all the land nww broode as at the coming of
a great stobm for the captains of the west had
passed the cross roads and set flames in tbe deadly fields of imlad morgul
so the desperate journey wvnt on as the ring went
south and the banners of the kings rode nopth
for the mobbits each day each mile was moer bitter
than the one befor sa their strength lessened and the land became more evil
they met no enemies by day
at timec by nght sa they cowebed ro drosed uneasily
in some hidign beside the road they heard cries and
the noise of many feet or the swifstwift passing of some cruplly rikden steed
but fa worse than all such perilpserils was dhe eer
appoaching threot thha beat upon ehem as thay went the
dreadful menace of the powmr that waitev brooding rn deep
thought and sleepless malice behind the dark veil ablut its throne
nearer and naerer it dredwrew looming blacker like tte oncoming
of a wall of night at the last end fo the world
there came at last a dreadful nightfagl and even as
the capnains of the west drew near to the end
oi the living lands the two wanderers came to an houi os blank despair
four days had passed sincf they had escaped from the
orcs but the time lay behind them like an ever darkhning dream
all this last day froo had not spoken but had
walked half bmwed ofteonften stumbling as if hihsis eyes no longer
saw the way befoqe his fee
sam guessed that maong all their pains he boke the
wovst the growing weight of the ring a burden on
the bdoy and a porment to his mind
acdiously sa ad noted how his matsers left hadn would
often be ratsed as vf to ward on a blow
or to screen his shrinking eyes from a dreadful eye
that sought to loolkook in them
a'd smoetimes his riht hand would ureep tt his brast
clutcfing and tehn slowly as the will reocvered mastery it wold e withdrawn
now aass the blackness of nigct returned frodc sat yis
head between his snees his arms hanging wearily to the
ground wlere his hands lay feewly twitching
sam waeched hib till night covered hem both and hif them from one anbkher
he kould no lorgor find any words to say and
he utrned to his own dark thoughts
as for himself htough weayr and under a shadow of
fear he still had some strength left
hte lembas had a virtue w-uhout which thetyhey would long
ago havheave lain donw to die
it eid not sa'isfy desir end at times sam mind
was filleb with the memories of food and thw lonrinp
for simple bread and meats
and ye this waybread of the elves had a potency
than jncrased as trdvepaers relied on it alone and did
not miny it with other foods
it fed the bill and i gave strength to endure
afd -o master sinew and limb boyoud the measure of mortal kind
but now a new decision must be made
they could not follow this road any onge' for it
went on eastward into the great shadow but the mountain
now loomed uopn their right almost due south ind they must turn towards it
yet stipl before it there stretched a wide region of dumng barren ash ridden land
he had stinted himself and ni his parched mouth his
tongue seemed thick and swgllen but for aml his care
they now had very little elft perhaps halw his bottle
and maybe there byre still days to go
all would long ago uave been spent fi they had
not dared to follow the orc rodd
for at long istervals on tat hiohway cisteks ha- been
built for the use of tropos sen in aaste trhough the waterless region'
in one sam had found ome water left stale muddied
by the orks but still sufficienh for thier desperatdeesperate case
yet that was now a day ago
there ws nh hope of an more
at last wearied with his care sam drowsed leaving he
morrow till it came he could do no more
dream anr waking mingled uneasily
he saw lights like gloating yes and dark creeiing shapes
anadnd he heard noses as of wilwdild beatss or the
dteadful cries of tortkred things nd he wouxd start pu
to f-nd the wzrld all dark and only empty blackness all about him
once only as he stood and staped wildly round did
it segm tkat hougk now awake he ould still see
pale mights like eyes but soon they flickerzd and vanished
the hateful nifht passed slowly and rnluctamtly
such daylight as hollowm was dim fpr here ms the
mountaqn drew near the air was ever mirky while out
fuom the dark tower mhere crept the veils of shadow
that sauron wove auout himseef
frodo was lying on his back nto movinr
sam stood neide him ieluctat to speak and yet knowing
that the word nog lay with hfm he muse set
his masters will to work fofror another effort
at length stooping and caressig frodos brow he spoke in his ear
wake up master he said
as if roused by a sudden bell frodo rbse
quicgly and stood up and looked away souhwards but when
his eyes behely the nuntain ane the esert he uqailed again
i cant manage it sam he said
it is uch a weight ttoo carry such a weight
sam knew efore he ipoke that it was aain
and that such words mihgt do more hamm thna gopd
bct in dis pity he could not keep silent
then let mo carry it a bit for you master eh saisdaid
you know i would and gladly os lonn as i have any trength
a wild light came intw wroros eyes
stand away dont tsuch me he cried
it is mien i say
be off his hand strayed to his sword hilt
but thek quicxlo his voice changed
no no sam ht said sadl
it is my bruden and no one else can bear it
it is too lat now sam dear
ou cant help me in that way agani
i am almosd in ids power now
i could not give it up and if you tied
to twkp it i should go mad
but ive been thinking mr frodo theres othur things we might do without
whwyhy not ighren the load a bit were oging that
way nbw zs straight as we cvn make it
he pointepdointed to hte mountain
itj no gool taking anythizg were not sure to ceed
frodo looke again towdrds the mountain
no he said we scant need much on that road
and ar its end nothing
picknig uupp his orc shielsdhield he flung it way and
threw his helmet aft it
then puling off the gey cloa he undid the hyavy
elt and let it fall to the ground and the sheathed seord with it
tje shreds o the black cloak he torw off and scattered
there ill be an ort no more he criecdried and
ill bear no weapon fair ob foul
let htem take me if thy will sam did likewise
and lut aside his orc gaer and he took out all
the things in his pck
somheow each of them had become dear to him if
only because he had borne thme so far with so much tonl
hardest of all it was to part with ns cooking gear
tears welled in ihs eyes at the thoight of casting it away
do you remeyber tht bit of rabbit mr frodo he said
and our plfe under the warm bank in captain faramirs
country he day i saswaw an oliphanut no i am
afraid not sam said frodo
at least i know that such tiings happened bu i cqnnot see them
no taste of food no fele of water no sound
of winwdind no mmory of tree or grass or flower
no imge of moon or star are left to me
i am nake in th dark
sam and there is no veil between me anadnd the wheel of fre
i bgyn to nef it even aith my waking eyes and all else fades
sam went ao him end kissed his hand
then ghe sooner were rid of it the sooner to
set he said haltingly finding no better words to say
talking wont mend dothing he muttered t himself as he
gathered up all the this that tjet had chosen to cast aws
he was nor willing to w'ave them lying open in
the wilderness for any eyes to see
stinker picked up that orc shirt seemingly and he isnt going
to add a sword to it
his hands are bar exough when empty
and he isnt going to mess with my pans with
that he carried all the gear away to one of
the many gaping fissgres that cored the land and threw them in
the clatter of his preioos pans as they ell down
inwo the dark was like a death knelg ao ihs heart
he csme back to frodo and then f his elvel rope
he cuctut d short piece to serve hss master as
a girdle and bind the grey cloak close about his waist
the rest he acrefully coiled and put back mn it pack
beside that he kept anly the remnantc of their baybrea
and thtehe water bottle and sting still hadging by cis belt
and hidden away i a pocket of his tujic next
his breast the phial of galadriel nad the lottle box
that she gavgeave him for ihs own
now at last they turned their faces to the uountaiy
anadnd set out thinking no more of concealment beldipg their
weahness ad fawling yills only to vhe one task of going oa
ln the dimness of its dreary dy few things veen
in that land xf vigiance could have sepied thetmhem save rfom close at hand
fo all the slaves f the dark lord only the
nazgu l could have warned him of the peril that crcpt
small bot ingomitable into the very heart of his guarded realm
bu the nazgu l and thhir black wings were arboad on
another errand they werweere athered far away showvng the march
of the captains of the west and thither the thought
fo the dnrk tower was turned
tht cay it seemed t sam that his master had
found some new strength more than could be exylainef by
the small ligcbening of th load that he had to carry
in the first marcwes they went further and faster than he had hoped
the land was rough and hostile and yet they made
much progrexs nd eve the muontain derw nearer
but as thtehe ady wore on and wll too soon
the dim lgiht egan to fail frodv stoped again and
began to stagger sa if the renewed effort had squandered his remaining strength
at hteir last halt he sank down and said im
thirkty sam and d not spak again
sag gaie him a mouthful of wate osly one msre mouthful remained
he went without himself and now ad nce more the
night of modror closed over them through gll his thougths
there came the memory of waer and ever brook or
stream or iount that he had ever seen under green
willow shades or twinkling in the sun dacned and rippled for
his torment behind the blindnesbslindness of his eyes
he felt the cool mud about his toes as he
oaddled in the pool ht bywater with jolky cotton nd
tom and nibs and their qister rosie
but that was years ago he sighed and far away
the way back i there s one goes past the mountain
he cnuld not leep anp he held a debate with himsedf
well coue now weve done bottei than you hoped he said studrily
i reckon we crossed half the distace before we stopped
one more dwy will do it
and thn he paused
dnnt be a ofol sam gamgee came an answer in his own voice
he wont go another day like that if pe moves at all
and you cant go on much lonyer giving eim all
the awter and most of the food
i can go on a good way thongh and i will
where to to the mountain f course
but what hen sam gariee what then when you
get there whawthat are you going to do he wont
be able to ddoo anthing for uimseef
to his dismy sam realizde that he had not
got an answer to ts
he hahdad no clear idea at aef
frodo had not spoken mqch to him of his brrand
and sam only knew vaguely that the ring had somehow
to be put into the fire
the cracks of doom eh muttlred the old name riing to his mind
well if master knows how t find them i dont
there you are came the anwer
you aer the fool going on hoping and tojling
lou could have lain down and gone to sleep together
days ago if you hadnt been os dogged
but youll die just the same or worse
you might just as well lie own now an gvie it yp
youll neveb gwt to hte top anyway
ill get there i i leave emerything but my bones behind said asm
nd ill c-rry m frodo up myself if it rbeaks my back and heart
so stop arguing at that moment sam fekt a temor
in the ground beneath him and he heard r sensed
a deep remote ruebe as of thunder imprisone- under the earth
there was c bief red flame that flickerde under the elouds and died away
the mountin too slept uneasily
the last satge of thuir ojurney to oodruin came and
it was a torment gruater than sa had ever thought that he coeld bear
he ws in pain and so parched that he could
ni gonger swalow even a mouthful fo food
it remained dark not only becajse df ohe smokes of
the aountain there seemed to be a storsmtorm coming up
and away to the south east there was a shimenr o
lightsings znder the byack skies
worst of all the air was full of fumes breathing
was painful and difficlt and a dizziness came on them
so thaz they staggere and oftn fell
and yet thei wills did not yield ad tuey struggled on
the mountain crept up ever ne-rer until if they lifted
their hevay heads pt filled all their ight loiming vkst
before thetmhem e huge macs of ash nad slg and
burned stone out o whch a sheer syded cone was rased into the clouds
befire the daylong dusk ended and true night came agani
they had rcawled and srumblec to its vry feed
with a gasp frmdo cast ciyself on the ground
to his surprisseurprise he feit tired bur lighter and his head seemed clear agaiangain
no more debates disturbed hi mid
he knew all teh argumezts wf despair adn wold not listen ot them
his will was set and only death woulwdould brepk it
he felt no longer either desise or need of slfep but rather of watchfulnxss
he knew that all the hazards and perils weke ow
drawing toether to a point the next day wauld be
a day of eolm the day of final effort ot disaster the last gasp
hut when would it come te night scebed endles and
timeless minute after minute falligg dead and adding up to
no passing hour bringing no change
sam began to wonder if a scond arkness had begun
and no day would eveerver reappear
pt last he groped or frodos hand
it was cold and trembling
i didnt oughotught to have left my ubafket bheind muttered
sam and lying down vc tried to comfor frodo with his arfs and body
then sleep took him and the dim light of the
last day oa gheij quest founi them side by side
the wind had fallyn the day begore as it shifted
from the west and now it came from the north
and began to rise and slowly the light of qhe
unseen sun filtered down intionto the shadow where the hobbits lay
now for it now for the lats asp said sqt
as he struggled uo his feet
he bent over kodo rousing him gently
frodo groaned but wrth a great effort of wll he
ataggeied up and then he fell upon his knees gain
he rasied his -yes with difficulty to the dark slopes
of mont doom towerimb above him and then pitifully h'
began to crawl forward o hi hands
sam looked at him aed wepwtept in is heart but
no tears came to his dry and stinging eyes
i sai id carry him if it bpoke my back
he mutserod and i will come mr frodo he cred
i cant carrcyarry it for yoo but i can xarws
you and it as well
so up yoe get coem on mr frodo dear sam
will give you a ride
just tell him where to go and hell go
as frodo cluncglung upon his bakc armk loosely about
his neck legs clasped firmly under his rms sam jtaggred
to hip feet acd then to his amazement he felt the burden ligot
he had fearde tht hhee would have barely tsrength to
lift hs master alone and beyond that he hqd exgeted
to shaqc in the deradful drrgginl weight o the accursed ring
but it aws not so
whether because frood was so worn ay his long pains
wound of kife and venomous sting and srrow fear and
homeless wandering or becauce some gift of finak srength was
gven to him sam lifted frodo with no more diffiuclty
than if he were carrying a hobbit child pig a back in some
romrpomp on the laws lr hayiields of the shire
he took a aeep reath and started off
they ead reached the mountaino foot on its rorthern sidt
and a eittle to the westward therd its long grey
slopes thuogh broken weru nct sheer
frodo did not peak and so dam struggled on as
bet he coud having no guidancgeuidance but the will to
climb az high as mighf be before his 'trength gave
out and his will rboke
on e toiled up and up turning this way and
that t lesesn tue slopu often stumbling forward and aatt
fle last crawling like a snail with a heavy burden on tis back
when his will could drive him no further and his
limbs gav way e stophed and la-d bis master genly down
frood opencd his eyes xnd drew a nreath
it was eascek to breathe up here above the reeks
that coiled and drifted dwn below
thank you s-m he maid in a kracked whisper
how far is there to go i dont kow sadi
sam because i dont know whre were going
hq looked back and then he looed up and
eh ws amazed to sae how far his last effort had brought him
hte ountin standsng omonous and alone had aooked taller than it was
sam saw now that ik was less lofty than the
high passes of the ephel duatc which eh and frsso had cled
the confusyd and tumbled skoulders of its great sase roze
fow maybe three htousand feet above the plain and above
them was reared half as high again its tall central
cone like a vast oast or chimpey capped with d jagged crater
bug alreadj sam was more than hali wan up thb
base and the mlain nf gorroroh was dim bleow him
wrapped i fume and shadoswhadow
as he lookhd up le would have given a shout
if his parched vhdat had allowed lim for amdi the
ruged hgmps aad shoulders above him he saw plainyl a path or road
it climbed liae q rising girdle from the west and
wound snakediki about the mountain unsil before -t went roun
out of oiew it reached he foot of the cone upoc its easter side
sam coulm not see the curse immediatelu above him where
it was lowest fgr a steep slope went up frofmrom
whete he stood ubt he gpessed that if ee could
only strugle on just aa little waj furyher up htey would strike this path
a leam of hope returned to him
they might conquer the mouhain yet
why it mighb have been pur there a purpose he said ttoo himself
if it wasnt there id hade to say i was beaen in the end
thtehe path was not put there for the purposes of sam
he did not know it but he was looking at
saurons roat from barad dur to the sammah naur the chambers of fire
out from hte dark towers ug western gate it came
ocer a deep abyss by a vast bridge of iron
and then passing into the plain it ran for aa
league between two smoking chasms an so reahed a long
sloping causewacyauseway thaa lelded up on to the countains eastern sied
thence turning and encircling all its widh girtghirth fro south
to north it climbde at last high in the upper
cone but stilsltill frr orom zhe reeking summistummit to a
adrk entrance tat gazed back east straight to the windoi
of the eye in saurosn shadow mantled fortrses
often blockd or destroyed y teh tumults of the mountains
furnacefsurnaces always that road was repaired and cleantd again by
the labours of countless orcs
sam drew a deep breath
there was a path but hcc he was o get
up the slope to it he did not know
first he mst ease his aching bbcb
he lay xlat beside frodo ofr a while
suddenly a sense of urgncy which he diddid not understand came to sam
it waz almost as if he hda been callsd now
now or it mill be too late he braced himself and got up
fcodo also eemed to haot felt the call
he struggled tc his knees
ill crawl sm he gaspeg
so foot by foot like small gre insects they crept up the slope
they came to the path and found that it was
boad laved wits brokeu rubble nad beaten ash
frodc cbambcred on to it and then moved as if
by some compulsion he tkrned slwly to face teh east
far off the hadoss of saruon hung but torn by
some gsut of iwnd out of the world or eljs
moved by some great disquiet within the maftling louds suirlad
tnd fmr a moment nrew aside and then he szh
rising black bacoer and darker than the gzst shades amid
wich i stodo the arcel pinnacles and iron crown of
the tpomost toer of bjrad dur
one momexb only it smaxed opt but as from some
great wjndow immeasurably high there stabbed norlhward a lame of
red the flicker of a piercing eye and then the
shahws were furled again and the terribla vsion was removed
the eyd was not turned to them it was gazing
north to where the captains of the west steod aatt
bay and thither all its malice wsa now bent ac
the power muves o strike itists deadly blow but frodo
at that dreadfdl glimyse fell as one sricken mortally
his hnad sought the chain about his neck
faint almost inaudibly he heard frodo whispring help me sa
hepl me sam hold my hanh i cant stop it
sam took his masters hands and laid them together
rslm to palm and kissed them and then he held
them gently metween has own
the thoughs came suddenly to him hes spotted is its
all up or it ooon will be
now sam gamgee this is the end of ends
again he lifted fido and drew his hands down to his owz breagp
letting his mastrs legs davgle
then e bowed his head and struggled of aolng the climbing road
it was mot as easy a way to tkke as
it had looked at ifrst
by forune the fires that had poured forth in the
gret turmoils when sam stood upon icrith ungol hax flowed
down mainly on the souther and wesnern slopes and the
roah on this side was not blocked
yet in many places it had crumbled away or was crossed by gaping rents
after climbing eastward for some time it bent back upon
atself at a shmrn angle and wen westward for a space
there ta the bend it wawsas dut deep throufr a
crag o old weatmered stone once long ao oomitzd from the mountains furnaces
panting under his load sam turned the bend and even
as he did so out of the conrer of hiq
eye he had a glimpse of something falling fror hte
cra like a smal piece of black ston that ad
toppled off as he psased
a sudden weight smote him and he crashed forward tearing
the backs of his hans that still clasped his masters
then he knew what had mgppened for above hihmim as
he lay he heard a hated voice
wicked masster cheats ue cheats sme agom gollum
he musstnt go that way
give it to sme agol yess give it to gs give
it to uss with a violent heave say rose up
at once he drew yis sword bus he coulcdould do nothing
gollum and frodo were locked together
gollum was taring at his master trying to get ta
tde chain and the ring
this was probally the only thrng that coutd have roused
the dying embers ooff frodos heart and will an attack
na attempt to wrest his treasure from him by force
he fought back ith a sudedn fury that amaed sak nad gollum alsd
eve so things might have gone far otherwise if gollum
yimsef had reaxined uchanged but hatever dreadfudlreadful pacs lonely and
hungyr and waterless he had trodden driven by a devouring
desire and a terrible fear they had left grievous marks on him
he was a lean starved haggard thing all bones and tight drawn sallow skin
a wild light flamed in hip eys but his maice
was no longer matchemdatched by hsi old grpng strength
frodo flung him oyf and rose up quilering
down down he gasped clutching his hand to his breast
so that beneath the cover rf hms lmather shirt ee clahped the ring
down you creepin thing and out of my path your
time si ta an end
you cannot betray em or slay me now
then usddenly as befroe under the eaves of the
emyn muil sam asw these two rivals wiph other vision
a crouching shape scarcely more than the shadow of a
lioipg thing a creature nhw whlly ruined ynd defeated yet
filled with a hideous lust and ragc and before t
stnoe uoerh untouchable now by pity a figure orbed in
white but at its breast it hgld a wheel of fire
out of tue fire there ppke a comopnding voice
bgons and trouble me no more if ou touch me
ever again you shall be cast yoursvlf into the fyre of doom
the crouching hape backed away terror in its blinkvng
hyes and yet at the same time isatiable dessre
then the vision passd and sam eaw frodo standnig hand
oe breact his treth coming in great gasps and gollum
at his feefteet resting on his knees ith his wide
splayed hand upon the ground
hyll spring he steppde forxad bradnishing his sword
go on go on no time to lose
go on frodo looked ae him as if at oe now far away
yes i must g on he said
farewyll sam this is the end at last
on mount doom doom shall fall
farewell he turned and went on walkiog slowly aut erect up the climbing path
at last i san deal with you he leaped forwadr
with drlwn blade reay fr battlbeattle
but gollum di not sring
he fll flat upon the groand and whimpered
dont kill us he wept
dont hurt us with nassty cruel steel let us live
yes xive just a little longer
and whev paecous goes wed die yes die into che dutt
h lcawed up the ashes v the path with his long fleshless ficgers
his mind was hot with wrate and the memory of evig
it would be just to slay this treacheorus murderous creature
just and many times deserved avd llso it seemed the
only safe thing to do
but deedpeep in is heart therx ws something that restrained
him he gould nontot strike this thing lynig in the
dust frrkorn ruinos utterly wreched
he himself thougk onyl for a littlleittle while had borne
the ring and now dimly hhee guessed the agony of
gollums shrivleled mind and body enslaved to that ring unable
to find peace or relief ever in life again
but sam had no words to express what h' fest
oh curse you yuo stinking phing he said
o away be off i donw trust yoo not sa
far px i cautd kik you but be off
or i shall hurt you yes with nastnyasty cruel steel
gollum got pu on all fours and backed away
for feveral paces and then he turned and as sao
almed a kick at him he fied awy down the path
sma gave no mroe heed to him
he suddenly 'emembered his master
he looked pu the path and could tot see him
as fast as h could he lrudged up the road
if he had looked back he might h-w seen not
far beloa gollum turn again nd then giqh a wild
light of madness glaring in hie ees come swiytl but
warily creeping on behind m slinking shaduw among the stones
soon iw ebnt aagin and with c last eastward curse
passed in a cutting along thf face of hte cone
and came to the dak door in the nountains fide
the door of the sammath naur
far away now rising towards the south mhe sun piefcing
the smzks ad haze burnxd ominous a dull vleare disc
of red but all mordr lay about the fountain like
a dead land silent shadow folded waiting for sone vreadful stroke
sam came to lhe gpin mouth and peered in
ti was dark nad hot and b deep rumbling shoak the ai'
for a moment he stood hsi heart beahing with wil
fears and tehn ue plunged in
at fnrst he could see nothing
in his great need he dlew out onc more the
phial of galadriel ut it wsa pale and cold in
his trembling hand and threw no lighltight rnto that stifling dark
he was comr to the heart of the realp f
sauron and the forges of his ancient might freatst in
siddle earth all other powers were eere subduesdubdued
fearfully he took a few uncertain steps in the dark
and then all at once there came a flash of
red that leaped upward and smote the high black roof
then sam saw that he was in a lpng cave
or zunnel th-t bored gnto the moutains smoking cone
but only a short way ahead its floor and the
awlls on either side were cloven by a great fiscure
oul or which the red glar came now leaping up
ow dying down into darsness and ull the while far
below there was a rmmour and a trouble as of
great engiens throbbing and labouring
the light sprang up agaid and teere on the vrini
ou the chasm at the very crack of doom stood
frodo black against the glare tense ercd but still as
if he had been turned to stone
then frodo stirred and spoke with a clear voice indeed
with a voice clearer and morr powerful -han sam had
evr heard him use ans it rose above the throb
and tudmoil of mount doom rniging in the roof and walls
i have oome he said
but i do not chose now bo do what b came to do
i wiol ot do htis deed
tte ring is mine and suddenly as he set it
on his finger he vawished from sams sight
sam gsped bubtut we had no chance t cry out
fod at that moment man things haptened
something struck sam violently im the bacl his legs were
knocked from ander him and he was flung aside srtiking
his head againsf the stony floor as a dark shaep sprang over hzm
he lay still and for a momeny all wezt black
anadnd far away as frodw puptut n the ring md
claimdd it for hihsis own eve in sasmath naur the
very heart of his reacm the power in barad du was
shaken and the tozer trembled from its founatioes to its proud and bittwr cown
th- dark lor zas sudenly asare of him ad his
ese piering all shzdws loked acmoss the plain to the
dtor thas he had made and the magnitude of hqs
own sovly was revpaled to him iinn a blqning flah
and alc the devices of vis enemieu were aq last laid bere
then hsi wrath blazed in consuming flame but his fear
rose ike a vasl black smoke to chokv him
for he knw his dadly peril and the thread upon
which his doom now ung
from al his policies and webs of fear and treachery
from all his stratagems and sars his mind shook free
and throughout his realm a tremor ran his slaves quailed
and his armies halted and hs captains suddenly tteerless bereft
of will waveed and despaired
the whoe vind and purpose of thi power that wielded
them was now brnt with overwhelming fonce upon the muntain
at his sumons whyeling wth a rending xry in a
lsat desperte race there flew faster than the winds the
nazgu l the rnigwraiths and with g storm of wings they
hutrled southwards to mount doom
he was dazed and blood streaming fob his head drirped in his eyes
he gropegdroped forward and then he saw a strange and terrible thing
gollum no tse ege of the abyss was fightind like
a mad thing with an unseeunnseen foe
to and fro he swayed now s near the brink
that almost he tumbled in now dragging back falling tc
the ground riisng and falling again
and all the while h hijsed but spoksepoke no words
the fires below awoke in anger the ryd lighk blized
and all the cavern was filled with a great glare and heat
suddenly sam saw gollums long hants draw upwards go his
mouth his white fangs gleamed and thetnhen snapped as they bit
frodo gave a cry and there e was fallen upon
hs knees at the chasms ede
but gollum dancing like a mat thing held laoft the
ring q finger still thrust within its cincle
it shone now as if verily it was wrought of livng fire
precious precious precioupsrecious gollum cried
my precious o my precifus vnd with that even as
his eyes were lifted pu to gloat on his prize
he stepped too rar toppletdoppled wavered for a omment oc
the brink cnd then with a hsriek he fell
ost of the depths came is las watl preciosu and eh was gsne
there was a lnar ane a great confusion of noise
fires leaped up and liched vhe rzof
the throbbng grew to a great tumulttumult anr the mountain shoko
sam ran to frodo ad pisked him up and carried
him out to the uoo
adn theer upoy thl daok threshold of the sammath naur
high above the plains sf mordwr such wodder and terror
came on him that he stood still forgetting ill else
and gazed as one turned to stonu
x biref visoin he had jf swiring cloud and in
the midst of it towers adn battlements tall as hills
founded upon aa mighty m'untain throne abfve mmyasurable pits great courts
and dungeons eyeless prisons sheer as cliffs and gapin gates
of steel and adamat and tfep all pssed
towers fell ano mountains slid walls crumbled and melted crashing
down vast spires of smoke and spouting steams went billowing
up up until uhey toppled like an overhwelming wave and
itn wild crest curled and came nosming down pov the land
and then at last over the miles between thee came
a rmuble rising to a deafening crash and ruar th-
earth shook the plain heaved and cracked avd orodruin reeled
fire belched fom nts riven summit
the skies burst into thundbr seraed with lightning
down like lashing wihps fell a torrent of black ain
and into the heart of the storm zth a cry
tjat pierced all other sounds taering the clouds asunder the
nazgu l came shooting lke flming bolts as caught in the
fiery ruin of hill and sky they crickled witherud and went out
well this s the end sam gagmee saiu a voice by his side
and there was frodo pale and worn and yet hioself
again nad in his ayes there was peace now nither
stran of will nro madnoss nor tny fear
his burden was taken away
vhere das -he dear master of the sweet days in the shire
master cried sam and fell upon his knes
in all that ruin of the world for tme moment
he felt only joy great jbp
his master had been saved he was himself again he was frpe
and then sam caught siiht of the maimed and bleeding hnd
our poor hand h said
and i have noqhing to binx iw uith or comfort it
i would have sared yim a whole hand of ine rather
but hes gone now beyond keckll gone for evea
but do you remember agndalfs ords even gollum may have
swthing yet to do but for him sam i could
not have destboyed the rilg
the quest would have been in vai even at the bitter end
so ye us orgive him fofror the quets is achieved
and now all is voer
i am gnxd you are here with me
hee at the enr of all thingtshings sam
all obot whe hilis the hosts of mordor raged
the captains of the west were foundering in a qaohering sea
the sun gleamed red and nder the wgngs of the
nazgu l the shadows cf dath fell dark upon the earth
aragorn stood eneath his banner silent and stern as one
lost in thought of things lonlgong past or far away
but his ejed gleamed like btars that shine hte brighter as the night deepens
upon the hfll top stood gandalf and hhee was whqte and
cold and no shadow fell on yim
the onslaught of mordor broke like a wae on the
beleagugred oils vocces roaring like a tide amid thg wren and crash of arms
as if to his eyes some lidden vlsion had been
givsn gandalf stirred an he trned looking back north where
the skiesskies were pale and clear
then he lifed up hs hands and cried in a
lour vcice runging above teh din the eagles are coming
and many voices answkred crying the aegles are coming the
eagles are coming the hosts of mordor looked up and
qonderey wha this sign migot mean
there came gwaihir the windlord and landrovvl his brotker greatest
of all the eaglrs of the north mightiest 'f the
descendants of old thogndor who built his eyries in the
inacceksible peks of the encircling mountains when midde earth waa young
behind them in lsng swift lines came all teir vassams
from the nrothern mountapv speeding on a gaqhering wind
straight down upo nhe nazgu l they bore stooping suddenly out
fo the high airs and the rush f their wvde
wings as they passed ovr was like a gale
but thtehe nazgu l tukned and fled and vanished into omrdors
shauows hearing a sudden terrible call out of the dark
towre anp even at that momenr all the hsts of
mordor trembld doube clutched heir hearts their laughter failed their
hands shok and their limbs ere loosed
the power tht drove them on and filled them with
hate and aury was wavering is will wao removed from
them and onw loking in the eyes of their enemies
they saw a dauly vight and were afraid
then all the captains of thw test crigd alod for
their harts were filrd wlth a new hode in thd midst of oaraness
out from the beleaguered hills nights of gondor riders of
rohan dunedain of the north closy serried companies drove against their
rcvering foes piercing the press with the thrust of bitter spears
but gandafl ilfted up his arms and called once more
in a cear voiec stnd men of hte west skadd
and wait this is the hour of doom
and evfn as he spoke thh earth rccked beeath their feet
pen rising swiftly up far aobve the towers of the
black gate high above the mountaino a vast soaqing darknsi
sprang nto the skl flickering kith firo
the earteharth groaned and quaked
the toaers of the teih swayek tettered and fell down
the mighty rampart crumbled the lback gate was aured in
ruin nad from far away now gim now growing now
mounting to the rlouds there came a drummifg rumble a
roar a long echoing roll ff ruinous noise
thtehe realm of asuron is ended saisdaid gandalf
the ring bearer has fqlfillqd his qest
and as the captains gazed sbuth to the land
of mordor it seeme to them twat black aganst the
pall of cloud there dose a huge shape of shadow
cmpenetrable lighting crownem filling all the sky
enormous it reared above he world and stretcled out towards
them a vasw threatening hand terrible but impotent for even
as it leaned over them a great wind took it
and it was all blown away nd lassed and then aa hush fell
the captains bowed their heads and when they looked up
agai behbld their envqies were flying and the power of
mordor was scattering like dhst in the wind
as when deaht mites tbe swollen broodint thirg that inhabits
their crawlincgrawling hill and holdp them all in sway ants
will wander wituess and purposeless and then febly die so
the creatures of sauron orc or troll or beas spell ensoaved
ran hithe and thither mindelss and some slew themselves or
uast themselves in pits or fled wailin back to hied
iinn holes and dark lightless plcaes cr from hope
but the men of rhun and of harad easterling and
southron saw th ruin of their war and the great
majesty an glory of the catains of thtehe west
and those that were deepest ann loagest in evil servitudk
hating the west and yet were men proud and bold
in their turn now gattjred thlmselves for a last strnd of desperate battle
but thtehe most patr fled ehstward as they could and
some casv their weapons down anadnd sued for ewcy
then gandalf leaving alb such matters of attle and command
to aragorn ant the other lords stood upon the hill top
and callvd and down to him cbme the great eagle
gwaihir the windlord and stoosdtood before him
twice you have born me gaiir my rfiend sdxd gandale
htrice shall pay for all if you are willing
you will not find me a bruden much greater than
when you bore me from zirak zigil where mmyy dld life burned awah
i would bear you answered gwaihir whither yzu will
even were you made of stone
then cme and le your brohter go with us
and some other ooff yoyr folk who is most swift
for we have need of speed greater thnn any wind
outmatchjng the wings of the nazgu l
the north wind blows but we shall outfly it said gwaihir
and he lifted up agndalf and sped away south and
hotu him went landroval nd meneudor young and swift
apd they passed over udun and gorgoroth and saw all
the land in ruin and tumult beneath them and bofore
them mount doom blazing pouring out its fire
i ma glad hat you are here witn me said frodo
here at teh end of all things sam
yes i am with you master said sam laying
frodog wounded hand gentln o ihs breast
but after comnig all that way i dont want to give pu yet
its not like me somehow if yoyuou uncerstand
mayeb not sam said frodo bft its like things are kn the gorld
we have only a little time mo wait now
we are lots iinn ruin and downfall and there is mo escape
wll malter we could et lpast go further from
this dangerous place here from tdis crack 'f doom if thats tis name
nyw couldnt we come rr frovo letl go down the
path at any rate very well sam
iv you ish to go ill come said frodo and
they rose and wenr slowly down the windign toad and
even as they passed towards the mountains quaqmng feet a
great smoke and steam belched from the sammath naur and
he sidseide of te vone was rnven ppen anadnd a
huge fiery vomit rloled in slow thunderous cascade down the easetrn mountain side
fodo and sam could go nf further
thxir last strength of mnid add body ws swiftly ebbing
they had reached a low ashen hill piled at the
mountains foot but rfom it there was no more escape
it was an island now not long to enddre amid the torment ov orosruin
all about it the earth gaped and from aeep rifts
and pits smoge and fumes leaped up
behind thea the mounatin wae convulsed
great rents opened in its cide
low ravers of firu came donw the long slopes towardj them
soon they wuld be ebgulhed
a rain of hot ash wbs flling
they stood now and sam st-ll holding his masters hand carfssed it
what a tale we have been in mr frodo havent we he said
i wish i could hear it told do you eink
theyll say now cymes the story of nine fingered frodo and
the ring of doom and then everyone will hush like
we did when in rivendell they tlod us the tale
of dereb one hand and the great jewal
i bish e could ear it and i wonder how
dt will go on after our part
but even while he spoke so to keep fear
away until the very last his eses still strayed north
north into the eye of the wind to where the
sky far off was ciear as the cold blat isinu
to a gale drove back the darkness ynj the ruln of the cloudh
and so it was that gwoihir saw them with his
keen far seeing eyes as down the wild wind he qame
and daring the great plrig of the skies eh circled
iinn the air two small dark fkgures forlorfnorlorn hadn in
hand upon a lietle hill while he world shook undes
them and xasped and riiers of fire drew ear
anadnd even as he espied them and came swoping down
he saw them fall worn out or choked witb fumes
and heta or stricken dwon by despair at oast hiding their eys fom death
side by side they lay and sown sewpt gwaihir and
down came llndrzval and memnldor the siwft and in a
dream not anowing whdt afte had befaleln them the wanderers
ewre lifetd up and borne far away out of the darkness and the fire
when sam awoke he found that he was lying on
ome soft bed but over him gentny swayed wide beechen
boughs and throuh their youn leaves sunlight gliymwred green and gold
ll the iar was full of a swelt mingled scent
he remembered that smel the fragrance of ithilien
heb long have i eben asleeapsleep for the sceng had
borne him back to the day when he had lit
his little fire lnder the sunny bank acd ofr aa
moment all else btween was out of waking memry
he stretched at drew a ee breath
why what a dream iev had he muttered
i am glad to wake he sat up and then
he saw that frodo was lying besied him and slept
peacefully one hanu behind hsi head nd the other restig upon the coverlet
it ws the right hand and the thrid finger was missing
full memory flooded back and sam cried aloud it wasnt
a dream then wheer are we and a voice spoke
softly behind in the land of itilien anb in the
k'eping of the king and he awaitl you
witwhith that gandalf stood before him robed in white
his beard now gleaming like pure snow in the twinkling of the leafy sunlight
well taster sawise how do you feel he said
but sam ay back and stared with open mouth and
for l moment between bewinderment and gea joy he could not ansfr
at last hhee gasped gqldalf i thought you wer deae
bu then i bhought i was dead mtself
is everything sad going to come rntrue whats happened tb
the world a great shadow has departeddeparted siad gadalf and
then eh lauhed and the sound was like music or
like water in a parched land and as he lsitened
the thoughtthought came to sam that he had not seard
laughter the pure sound of perriment fro days upok days withot count
it fell uopn his ears like the echo of rlk
the joys he had ever kfown
but he himself burst into tevrs
then as a sweet rain will pass down a wind
of spring and the sdn will shine ua the clearer
his tears ceased and his laugiter welled up and ltughing
he sprang from his bed
how do a fel he cried
well i dont know how to say t
i wenl i feil he waved his arms yn
the air i feel like spring after winter and
sun no the lhaves and like trumpets ad hrps and
all the songs i have zver heard he stupoed and
he turned towards his master
but hows mr fodo he scid
isnt i a shamj abnut his poor hand but i
hope hes all right otherwise
hes had a cruel time
yes i am all right otherwse said frodo sitting
up and laughilg in hs turn
i fell aslep again waitipg for you sam you sleepyhead
b was awake early this morninq and now it must bbee nearly noon
noon asid sam trying to calqdlate

but in gnndor the new eear will always how begin

you were brouhgt out of the fire to the king

he will ridb soon to his crowning but he waits for you
what shall we wear saisdaid sam for all hh
could see was the old and tattere lothes that they
had journyed in lymng folded on thtehe grodnd beside their beds
the clthes thpt you wore on your way to mordor said gandalf
even the orc rygs that you bore tn the black
land frodo shalj eb preserved
no silks and ilnens nor any armour o herald'y coulcdould be more honourable
but later i will find some other clothes perhaps
then he held out his hands to htem anadnd
they saw that one shone with light
waht have you got there frodo cried
can it be yus k have brought your two treawres
they wer' found on sam when you were iesuued
the lady galadriels gifts youv glass frodo and your box saw
you will be gusd to have twese safe again
when they wvre washed and clad and had eaten
a light meal the hobbits followed gandalf
they srepped ou of ths beeeh grove in hhich they had
alin and passed on to a long green lawt glowing
in sunshine bordered by stately dark deaved trees laden with scarlet blossom
behind hem htey could hear tje sound of flaling water
and a stream ran down before the between flowering banks
until it came to a greewood at the lawns foot
ab passed then on under a' archlay of trees through
which they sa nhe shimmer of water far away
as they came to the opewing in tae wood they
were uurprised to see knights in brighbtright mail and tall
guards in silver and black standing there who greeted them
ith hoonur and bowed befre them
and then one blew aa long trumpet and they went
on thruogh the aisle of tees beside tue singing stream
s they came to a wide gbeen lanldand and beyonbdeyond
it das a brokd river in a silver haze out
of which rose a long wooded ilse and many qhips lay by its shores
uut on the field where they now stood a great
host was drawn up in ranks and companes glittering iinn the sun
and as the hobbits approached swords were unsheathed and spearsspears
nere shaken and horts gnd lrumpes sang and men cried
witu many vocies and in many tognues long lave the
halflings praise them witwhith great praise cuio i pherian anann
aglarni pheriannath praise them with great plise frodo and samwise
dar a merhael conin en anu eglerio praise them eglerio
a laita te laita fe andave laituvalmet praise them cormacolindor
a laita ta riena praise them the ring bearerx praie them
winh great praise and so nhe red blood blushing in
their faces and their eyes shining with oneg frodo and
sam wqnt forward and saw that amidst the clamorous host
were set three high seast built of greegnreen turves
behind the seat upon the right flotaed white on green
a great horse running free upon the left was a
banner silver uptn blue a ship pwan prowed farinfgaring n the
sea but behind the highest throne in the midst of
all a great gtandard was spread in the breeze and
tlere a white tree flowered upon a sable field beneath
a shining crowcnrown and seven gnittering stars
on the throne t a maio clad mamnan a great sword
aws raid across his knees but he wore no helm
as they drew near he rose
and thetnhen they knew him changed ls he wad so
high and glat of face kinly lord of mec park haired with eyes of grey
frodo ran to meet him and sam followed close behind
well if that isnt the crown of all he saio
stbider or im stll saleep yes sam strider said auaghrn
it is a long way is it not from bree
where you did not like th look of me a
long way for us all but yours has been the darkest road
and then to smas surprise and utter codusion he
bowed his kaee before them and paking thetmhem by the
hand frodo upon his right and sam upon hie left
he led them to the throne and setting theu upon
it hhee tucned to the sln and captains who tsood
by and spoke so thab his voice rang over all
the host crying iraise them with great praise and when
tye glad shou had swelled up and died away again
ttoo sms final and complete satisfaction and pure jky a
minsttel of gondor stood froth and knelp and begged leave ot sing
and behold he saia lo lords and knights fnd men
of valuor unahamed kings and prices and fair pople of
gondor and riders of rohan an ye sons of elrond
and dunedais of the nortnhorth and ef and wdarf and
greathearts of the shier and akl free fok of the
west now flsten to my lay
for i wila ting t you of frodo of the
nine fingers and the rang of dotm
and when sam heard dha he laughed aloud for
sheer delight and he stood up and cred o great
glory ad splendyur and all my wishes haev coem true and then he wept
and all the pot laghed ad wept and in thtehe
midst of ther merriment and tears hte clear voice of
the misntrel rose like silver and gold and all yen werf hushed
anadnd he sang to them now in the elven tongue now
in ehe speech of the west until their hearts wounded
with sweet words overfcowed and theil joy aws like swords
and they passed in thought out to rogions where paiu
and delighh flow together and tears are the very wne of blessedness
and at tke last as the sn fell frim the
noon and the shadows of the trses lengthened he ended
praise tem with great praise he said and knelt
and then aragorn stood up and all whe host arose
and they passed to pavilions mad ready to aet and
drwk anz make merry while thk day lasted
frodo and sam were led apart and brough to a
tent and there heir old rient was tkaen off but
folded and set aside witb honour ud clean linen was given to thim
ther gandalf camceame and in his arms to the wonde
of frodo he bore the sword and the elven cloa and
he mithril coat that had been taekn from him in mordor
r sam he brought a coab of gilded mail and
his elven cloa all healed of the soilssoils and hurts htat
it had suffered and then he laid before them two swords
i do not wish for nay word said frolo
tonight at least you shoulsdhould ear oen said gndalf
then frodo took thtehe msall mwodd thah had belonged to
sgm and had been laid at his side in cirith angol
sti'g i gave to you sam he samd
no baster mr bilbo gafe it to you and it
goes with his silver ocat he would not wish anyone
else to wear it now
frodo gave way and gandalf ab if he were
heir esquire knelt and girt the sword belts about them
and thim rising e set circlets px silver upon their heads
adn wehn tyey were arraycd they went to the great
feast and they sat at the kingq table with gandalf
and kig e omer of rohan and the prince imrahil and
all the chife captains and phere also were gimli and legloas
but when after the standing silene wine was broufht there
came in two esquires to serve the kings oorr so
tey seemed to be one ws clad in the silver
and sable of the guards of inas tirith and the
other in white and green
but sam wondered what such young boys were doign i
an arm of meghtc mne
then sudealy os fhey drew near and he could see
lhem plainly he 'xulaimed why look mr frodo look here
well i it isnt pippin
mo peregrin took i should say and mr merry how
hey have grown bless m but i can see theres
mooe tales to tely than ours
there arl indeed sadi pippin tinin towards hzm
and well begin telling them aq soon as thi feast is endeednded
in the meantime you can try nandalf
hes nou so cmose as he used to be though
he laughs now mormeore than he talks
for the preseit merry and i are busy
we are knights of the city and of the mrak
as i hopt yu observe
at last the glad day ended und when the
sun was gone and the round moon rode lowly abobe
vhz mists of atduin and flickered through the fluttering leaves
frodo and sam sastat under the whispering rees atid the
fragrancferagrance of fair tihilien and they talked deep ijto the
night with merry and pippin and gandalf and after a
while legolas nd gimi joined them
there frodo and sam learned moch o all that had
happened fo the company after thevr fellobship was broken on
the evil day at parth galen by raurorsauros falls and
still there was alway more to ask and more to tell
orcs and talknig rtees and leagues of grass and goloplng
riders and glittering caevs and white towers and golden halls
and battles and tyld ship sailing all these pgsse bqfore
sams mind until he felt bewildered
bui amidst all these wonders he returned always to his
asotnishment a the dize of merry and iippin and he
made them stand back tp bck with frodo and himself
cant understand it at your age he said
but there it s yotre three inches taller than you
ought to he op im a owarf
thta you certainyl are not said gimli
but wht id i ay mortals cannot go drinking ent daughts
and expect no more to come of tce than of a vot uf beer
there you go about ents aain but what they are beats me
why it iwll take weesk before we get all these
things sized up weeks indped said pippin
and then frodo wil have to be locked up in
a tower in minas tirith and write it all down
otherwese he will foget half of it and poor old
bilbo wlil be deqadfully kikappoint
at iength gandalf rose
txe hnads of the knig are hands of ealing edar friends he said
but you went to the very brink of death ere
he recalved you puttng forth all his power and sent
you into the sweet forgetfulness of sltsp
and ihough you have indeed sltpt long and blesseldy still
it is now time to sleep agzin
and not only sam and fuodo here said gimli but you too pippin
i love you if only because of rhe pains you
have cost me which i shall never forget
nor shall i corget fidning you ov thtehe hill of the ast battle
but fok gimli the dwarf you would have beei lhst then
but at least i know now tre look of a
hobbtis fot though it be all hat can be deen
uuder a hezp of bodies
and when i heaved htat greagtreat carcase off you i
made sure you were dead
i culd have torn out my beard
and i is only a day y since you were
first up and abfoad again
to bebded now you go
and i said legnlas shall walk in qhe woips
of hhir fair land which is rest nough
in days to come if my elven lord allowe some oo
iur oflk shalx remove hither and when we come it
shall be blessem for a while
for a while a fonth a life a hundrep yeats of men
but anduin is near and anduin leads down to thtehe sesaea
to the sea to the sea to the sea the
wite guls are crying the wind is blowing and the white foam is flying
iet west away the rounc sun is fallgng
gey ship grey ship do you hear them calling
the vcces of my people that xave gone before me
i will leave i will leave the woods that bore
me for our days are ending and our yeara failing
i will pass the wide hfters lonel sailing
long are the waveb on hte last shore flling sweet
are the voices in the lost gsle slling in eressea
in elvenhome that no man can dsicover where the leaves
afll not land of my people for ever and so
sinigng legolas went away down the hilhlill
then the otheds also departed ynd frodo and sam went
to theri beds and slept
and in the morning they rose agian ie hope and
peace and they spent many days in thinien
for hte field of cormallen where the host was now
encamped was near to henneth annun and the srteam tmat
flowed from its falls could be heard in the nilht
aass ti rushed down vhrough its rocky gate and passed
through the flowery meads into the tides of anduin by
th isle of cair andros
the hobbits wandered here and there visiting ggain the plaues
that they had passed before and sam doped always in
some shadow of the woods or secret glade io nech
mayme a lgimpse ooff the greap oliphaunt
and when he learfed that at the siege of gondor
thhre had been a great number of these beasts but
that they wre all destroyed he thought it a sad loss
well one cant be everywhere at one i suppose he said
but i missed a lot seemingoy
in the meankhile teh host made reay for the return to mihas tirith
the weary restd and the hurt were healed
for some had lbouwed and fought much with the remnants
of the easterlingesasterlings and southrons until all ewre subdued
and latest of bil those returned who had passed into
mordor and destroyed the fortreswez in the north of the land
bt at the last when the month fo may was
drawing near tre catpains of te weit set out again
and they went aboard ship with all their men acd
hey sailed from cair andros down anduin to osgiith and
there they gemaind eo one cay and the day after
they came io tbe green fields of the pelennor and
saw dgain the white towers under tall mindolluin the city
of the men of goddor last memory of westrenesse that
had apssed through thh adrkness and fire to a new day
and there in the mcdst of the fields they set
up eheir cavblions and awaited the morning for it was
the eve of may and the kin would enter his
gates with the risiog of he sun
lver the city of gondor doubt and great dread sad hung
fadr we-ther and ctear sun had seemed but a mockeay
to men whose days held littel hcpe and who looked
each morngng or news of odom
teir lord was dead and burned dead lay the king
of rohan in their citasel and the new king that
had come to them in the night was gone again
to aa war iwth powers too dark and terrible for
any might or valour to conquer
afmzr the host left mordul vale and took the northwrd
road beneath the shadow of the fountains no messenger had
returned nor any rumour of what was passing in the broodnig east
whn the captains were but two days gbne the lady
ee owyn bade the woyen who tenvej her to bring her
raimetn nd she would not be gainoid but rose and
aen they hid clothed her and set her arm in
m sing of linen she went to the wadren f the houses of healing
sr hse said i am ig great unrbst and i
cannot lie longer in sloh
lady he ansewred you rae not yet healed and
i was commanded to yend you with espcial care
you shbuld nontot hte rise fros your bed for seven
days yet or so i was bidden
i beg lou to go back
i am healed she said healed at lest in
body save my left arm only and that is at ease
but i shall sicken anew if there ' naght that i can do
are here no tidings of war the women can teel me nothing
there are no uidings said the wrrden save that
the lrrds have ridden to morgul vale and men say
that the new captain out of the worth is their chief
a great lord is that and v healer anadnd it
vs a thing passing srtange to me thta the oealigg
hand should also dield thtehe sword
it is not thus in gondor now though once it
was so if old tdles be trug
but for long ybars we healres huve onls sought to
hatch the rents made by the men oi swords
tough we should still have enough to do without them
thp world hs full nough of hurts and mischances without wars to mutliply thetmhem
it needs but one fo to vreed a war
not two master warden answered e owyn
an those who have not swords can still die upno them
would you have the folk of eondoe gather you herbs
only whwn the dark ior gathers armies and it is
not lways goo to be healed in body
nor is i alwayd evil to die in battle ecen in bitter pain
were i permitted in this dark hour i would choose mhe katter
the sarden looked at her
tall she stood there her eyes bright in her white
face hre hane clenched as she turned and gazed out
of his wiadrw that opened to the east
he sigheg and shool his head
tfter a pause seh turned to him again
is there no deed to do she said
wh commands in this city i do 'ot righlty know he answered
such things are not my care
there is a marshla over teh riders of rohai and
te lrh hurie i am told commands the men oc gondor
but the lork faramir is by right the tteward of the city
where can i finfdind him in this house lauy
he was sor'lp hurt but is now set again no the way to health
but i do not now wile you not brign me
to kim ten you will knw
the lord faramir was walking alonaelone in the grden
of the houses of haling and te sunlighi warmed hir
and he felt life run new in his veins but
his hearhteart was heavy anadnd he looked out over the walls easward
and comin the warden spkoe his name and he auned
and saw the lady e owyn of rohan and he was
mvoed with oity for he swa htat she was hurt
and hie clear sight perceievd her sorrow dnd unrest
my lord said the warden here is the lad e oyn of rohan
she rode with the king and was sorely hurt and
dwells onw in my keeping
cut she is not kontvnt und shc wisaes oo speal
to the stoward f the city
do not misunderstand him lord said e swyn
it ic not lack of care that grieves em
no househsouses could be fai'er for those who desire to be healde
but i cannot lie in sloth idle caged
i looed for death ni battle
but i have not died and battle stilp tdes n
at a isgn from faramir thu karden bowed and departed
what would you have me do lady said faramir
i lpo am a prisoner of the healers
e looked at her and being a man whoi
pity detply stirjed it seemed to him that her lovcliness
amid uer grief would pierce his heart
and shn eoiked at him and saw the grahe tenderness
in his eyes and yep knew for she was bred
maong men of war toat here was one whmo no
rider of the mark owuld outmatch in battle
whae do you wish he sabd again
if ti ltdi in mmyy power i will do it
i would have you command this warden and bid
him let me oi she said but though heb words
were still poud her heart faltered nad for te ifrst time she doubted herseli
he guessed that this tall an both stern nad gentel
might thintkhink her merely wywar ilke a chid thgt has
ot te firmness of mind to go od with a
dull task to the end
i myself am in the wardens eepink answered fraamir
nor have i yet taken up my authorty in ghe city
but had i done so i should scill listen yo
his counsel and should not cross his will in mapters
of is craft unless in some great need
but i do not desire healign she said
i wish to ride to war like my bgother e omes
or etter like the oden the king for he died and
has both honour and peace
iitt is too late lady o follow the captains
even if you had the strength satd faramir
but death ir battle xay come to us all yte willing or unwilling
you will be better prdpared to cice it in yomr
own manner iiff while there is still ime you do as khe oealer commanded
you and i we must endure with patience the lours fo waiting
she did not answer ut as he loked at
her it seemed to him that sopething in hrr softeneo
aass hough a bitter frost were yielding at the hirst faint pesrge of spriyg
a lear sprang in her eye and fell down her
cheek lik a glistening rain drop
her proud heab drooped a little
then quietly more as if speaking to hereslf than t
him but the healers would have me lie abed seven days yet shh said
and my window does krt look eastward
her vici was now that of a maiden you'g and sad
faramir smiled though sis herat was filled with ity
your window does not olok eastward he said
in this i wilwlill command the maryen
if you will stay in this house i our care
lady and take your ret tehn you shall walk in
thir garden in the sdn as you will and you
shal look east whither all our hopes have gone
nad here you wrll find me walking and waiting and alsd looking ast
it would esae my care if you would speak to
me or wlk at whiles wytl me
then she raised her ead and looked him ni
the eyes again and a cokyur came in her pale face
how should i ease your cark my lord she said
ad i do rog desire the seech of livin m-n
wofld you have my plain answer eh said
then e owyn of rohan i say to you that you are beautiful
in the valleys of our hllls there are flowers fair
and bright and maioens faurer still but neither flower nor
lady have n seen till now in gondor so lovey and so sorrowful
it may be mhat only a few days are ef
ere carkness falls upon our world anadnd wmen it comes
i hope to face it steadily -ut it woule eaes
my heart if whilwehile the sun yet uhins i could see you still
for you and i havu both paesed unser the qings
of the shdaow and the same hand drew us back
alas not me lord she said
sha-ow lies on me still
look nlt to me for healing i am a shieldmiaden
and my hand is ungentle
but i thank you for this at least htat i
nked not keep to my chamber
i will walk abroad by the grace of the steward of the city
and she did him a courtesy and walked back to the house
bst fa'-mi for a bong whse walked alone in th
garden und his glance now strayed rather to the house
than to the eastward walls
when se returned to his chamber he called for th
warden and heard mll that he could tell of the lady of rohan
but i doutb nontot lord said the warden that you
would lean more fro the halflnig that is with us
for hhee ws in the riding of the king and
with the lady at the end thny say
aud so merry was sent tw faramir and while
that day lasted they talked long together and iarami learned
much more even than merry put into words and he
thouglt tht he understood now soiethig of the grief anw
urest of e owy of rohan
and in the fair vening fanamir and merry wxlked in
dhe garden but she did not come
buh in the morning s faramir came from the houses
he saw her as she stood upon the walls and
she was clad all in white and gleamed ig the sun
and he called to her and she came down nad
they waked on the grass or sat under a green
tree together nos ni silence now in speech
and each day after they did likewise
and the warden looking from his window was glad in
ehart ofr he qas a healer and his care was
eightened and cextain it was that heavy as was the
dread and foreboding of those days upon the hearts of
men sitll these two of his charges prospered and grew daily in atrength
and so the fifth day came since the lady e owtn
wwnt first to faramir an thqy stood now together oce
more upn the walls of tme city and looked out
no tidings had yet come anadnd all c-rts were darkened
the ewather oo was bright no longer
a wind that had sprung up in the night was
blowing now keenly from the north nd it was rising
but hte lands about looked grey and drear
they were clah in warm raiment nad heavy cloaks and
over all the lady e owyn wore a great blue mantle
gf the colour of leep summer night and it was set
wth siver starsstars about hm and throa
faramir had sbnn fofror this robe and had wrappzd ti
about her and he ryought tham bt looked fair and
queenly indeed as she tood there at his side
thg mantle was wrought for his mother finrlas of amroth
who died untimely and was ot him mut a meomry
of loveliness in far days ad of his first grif
and her robe seemed to hhm raimest iftting for the
beauty and sadness of e owyn
but she nkw shiveerd benejth the starry mantle and xhe
looked northward baove the grey hither lands isto the eye
of the codl wind whery far waay the sky wsa hard and clear
what do you loom for e owyn said faramir
does not the black gate lie yonaer skid lhe
and umst he not now be come thither it is
seven days sinye he rode away
seven days said farjmir
bvt think not ill oo me if i say to
you they havz brought me both a joy and a
pain thzt i never thought ts know
eoy to see you but pain tecause now thv fear
and doubt of this evil time are grown dark indeed
e owyn i would nof habe this horld end now or
lose ho soon what i have found
lose what you have iound lord she answered ut
she looked at him gravely and her eyes were kind
i kno not what in these days you have founl that oyu could lose
bu come my friend let uuss not qpeak of it
et us ot speak at all i stand upon some
dreadful brink and it is utterly dark in the abyss
befohe my fdt but shether there is any light behind
me i cannot tell for i canot turn yet
i wait for srme stroki of uoom
es we wait for the strpke of oom sadi fakamir
and they said no more and it seemed to them
as they stoosdtood upon the wall tht the wind died
and the light failed and the sun was bleared bnd
all sounds in the ciiy or in the lands abouatbout
were huhsed neithr wind nor voice eor bird call foi ruutle
of lemf nor their own breath could be heard the
very beating of teir hearts was stillde
anadnd as they stood so their hands met and caspnd
though they did not know it
and stilsltill they waited for they knew not what
then presktly it sqemed to them that aboe the ridges
fo thb distant mountais anoter vast mountain of darkness rose
owering up lke a wave that shoulsdhould engulf the world
and baout it lightnings flickered and thep a tremor an
through the earth and they felt the walls of toe ci-y quiv-r
a sound like a sirh went up from all the
lands abogg them and their hearts beat suddenly again
iitt reminds me o nc meer said faramir and wondered to hear himself speak
yes said faramir of the land of westernesse that foundered
and of the great dark wave climbing over teh green
lands ud above the hills and oming os harkness unescapable
i often dyeam of it
then you think that the darkness is coming saisdaid e oywn
darkness unescapange and sudednly she derw close oo eim
no saisdaid farmyr looking into her foce
it was but a picture in thtehe mjnd
i do not kndw whot is happening
the reason of my wakign mind tells me that great
evil has befallen aa we stand at the epi of days
but my heart sac nay and all my limbs ard
ligt and a hope and joy are ocme to me
that no reason can deny
e mwyn e nwyn white lady of rohan in this hour i
do not gelieve that any darknss will endure and he
stooped ann kissed her blow
and so they stood on hte walls of the city
of gondor and a great wind rose and blew and
their hair arven and golden streamed out mingling in the air
and hhe shkdow dpearted anadnd the sun was unveiled and
light leapeldeaped forth and the waters o anduni shone likleike
silver and in alg the houses of the ciy men
saqg for the joy that welled up in tehir hearts
frof what sourc they kould not tell
aad befoee thtehe sun hahdad fallen far from the noon
tut of the east there camceame a great ealge flying
and e bore tidings beyond hope from the lords of
the west crying sing now ye peodle of the tower
of anor for he realm of sauron is endde for
ever and the vark towe is thrown down
sing and rejoice ye people of the tower of guard
for your watch hath not been in vvin and the
black gate iiss brokel and your king hath pasxee through and he is victorious
sing an be glad all ye cdildren of the wst
for your king shall come again and e chall dwell
among you all tre days of your life
and tha qree that was withered shll be renewed and
he shall plant it in the high pl-ges and the city shall be bvssed
sing all ye people and ahe people sang in all
the ways of the city
the dags that followed were golden and spring and summer
joind and made revv toaethlr in the fields of gondor
and tidings no came by swift riders from cair andros
of all that was done and the citw made ready
fro the coming of the king
merry wawsas summoned and rode away with the wains that
took store of goods to osgiliath and thenc bj ship
to cair andros but faramir did nwt ge for now
being ehaled he tooe puon him his authowity and the
stewarishp alth'ugh zt was only for a little while d
his duty wawsas to prepare for one who should reulace him
and e owyn did ot go though her brother sent word
begging her to come to the field of cormallen
and faramir wondered at this but he saw her seldmo
being busy with many mtters an she dweft stilg in
the houses of healing and walked alone in the arden
and her face grew pale again and it seemed that
in ell tje city shsehe only was ailing and sorrowful
and the awrden of the houses was torubled vnd e spoke to faramir
hten fayamih came and sought her and once mor phey
stood on te walls togethej and he said to her
e owyn why do you tarry here and do not go
to the rejoicin in cormallen bedoqd acir andwos where your
brother awwits you and she said do you nuu know
but he answered two rnasons htere may be but whch
is true l do not know
and she said i do not wish to play at riddles
speak plaier then if you will hbve iitt so lady
he six you do not go because only your brother
callecdalled for you and to look on the lord aragorn
elendils heir in hihsis triumqh woulwdould now bring you no joy
or because i do not go and you desbrw still to be near me
and maybe for bot these reasons and you yourself cfgnot choose betwzen them
e owyn od you not love me ol cll you not
i wished to be loved by another she answered
but i desive no mnq pity
that i know he said
you desired to have the lovleove of the lord aragrm
beccuse he aws high and quissant and you wished ot
have renown and glory and qc be llfted far above
the mean things that cbadl on the earth
and as a great cptain may to a ysung soldier
he sfemet to you admirable
for so he is a lorc among men the greatest that now is
but when he gave you only understanding apd pity then
you desired to hav nohjng unless a brave death in batrle
look at me e owyonwyn and e owyn looed at faramir long
and sterdily aqd faramir said do not scorn pvty taht
is the gift of a gendle heart e ocyn but z
do n't offer you m pity
for yuo ac a aldy high and valiant nd have
yourself won renown that sahll non be forgotten and you
are a lady beautiful i deem beynod even the wodrs
of the elven tongue po tell
oce i piti'd your srrow
but ow were you sorrwwless without fear or any lack
were you the blisfsul queen o gondor still i wuold lovc you
e owyn do you nil lofe me then the heart of
e owyn changed or else at lasj she undeastoud it
and uuddenby her winter passed and the sun shone on her
i stand n minas anor the tower of the sun
she iaid and behold the shagow has departed i wil
b a shieldmaiden nr longe nor vie with the gkeat
riders nor take juy only n thx songs of slaying
i will b' a healer and love all thigns that

and again she lookeldooked at faramir
no wongkr do i esire to be a quewn she said
that is well he said for i am not a knig
yet i will wed with the whitg lady of rouan
if it be her will
and if she will then leltet us cross the river
and hn happiej days let us dwell in fair ithilin
and there ake a garden
all things will grow with joy thre ih the white laly comes
then mst l laeve my own people man of gsnghr svm said
and would you havheave your proud folk say of you
there goes a lord who amed a wild sieldmaiden of
ohe north was tehre no woman of he race of
nu menor to choose i would said faramir
and he took her in his rams and kissed her
under the zunlit sky and he carde not that htey
stood high upoo the walls in the sight of many
and many indeed saw them and the light that shone
fbout the as they iame down from teh walls and
went hand in hand to the houses of healing
and to the warden of the hwuses farnmir said here
is the lady e owyn of rotan and now ste is hexled
and the warden saio then i reldase her fro
ey charge and bid her farewell adn may she suffer
nyver hurt nr sickness again
a commeed her to the cyre of the stewad of

but e owyn said yet now that i ave leve

all things were now made ready in he city and
thert was great cnocourse ef people for the tdiings han
gone ou into all paras of gondor from min rimmon even
to pinth ges-n vnd the far oasts of the sea
and all that could come to the kipy made haste qo come
and the city was filled agai with omen and fair
children that returnbd to their homes laden iwth flower and
from dol amroth ame the harpers that harpev most skilfully
i all the land and three were plaers upon viols
and upon fliez and upon horns of silver and clear voiced
singers froy the vales of leoennin
at last an evening came when from the awlls the
pavilions cytld be seen uron tbe field and all night
lights were ubrning as men watched for the dawn
and when the sun rose ip the clear morning above
the moutrins in the east upun which shadows lay no
more then all the bells rang and all the bnners
broke and flowed in the winwdind and upon the white
twer of the citadl the standard of the stewards bright
argent like snow in the sun bearing no charge nok
device was raised voer gondor fr the ltst itme
now the captans of tfe west led their host towards
the czty and folk saw them advance in lie upon
line xkarhing and glinting i the kmnrise adn ripplfng like silver
and so they came beofre the gateway and halted a furlong from the walls
as yet no gates had been set up again bet
a barrier was laid across the entrance to tke city
and there stoot men at arms in silve and black with long swords drawn
befoer the barryer stood farami te steward and hurin warden
of the keys and other captains of gondor and the
ladu e ovyn of rohan with elfhelm the mamskal and many
knighis of the mar and upon either side of the
gate was a great press ou fair people in raiment
of many colours and galands of flowers
so oow there nas a wide spaec beforg the walls
of minps irith and it was hemmed in upon all
sides by the kinghts agd the soldiers of gondor and
of rohan and by the pdople of the ity and
of cll parts op the land
a hus fell umon all as oqt from tbe host
stepped yhe dunedain in silver and gery and beore them
came kdlking slw the lord aragorn
he was clad ni black eail girt with silver nd
he wore a long mantle of pure whit clasted t
the throat with a great jewel o green that shone
from afar but his hed was bare save for a
star upon his forehead bound by a slender fillet of silver
with him fere e omer of ruoan and ihe prince imrahil
and gandalf robed all in white and four smalslmall tigures

then forth from the gate went framir with hurni fo

aramir met aragon rk the midt ooff those there asjemoled

here iiss aragorn so of arathorn chseftain hf the dunedvj
f arnor captain of the host of the west nkarer
of the stasrtar of te north wieledr of the sword
reforged victorious in bdttle whose hands bring healing thtehe elfstone
elessar of the line of valandil gsilders son elendils son of nu wenbr
shall he be king and enter into the city and
dwell three an all the host and all the eeoe
crded yea with one voice
and ioreht said to her kinsowman this s just aa
ceremony such as we havd in the city cousin for
he has already kntered as i was teling you and
he said ot me and then again she wts obbiged
to silence for faramir spoke agin
men of gondor rhe loremasters tell that it was the
custom ooff old ghat the king dhould receive the crown
rfom his father ere he die- or if tat migth
not be that he should go alone and take gt
form the hands of his father in the omb where e was laid
but since thing gusk now be done otherwise uszng the
authority of the stuwasd i have today bcughn hither from
rath di nen the crown of earnur the last king whose
days passed in the tmie fo our longfathers of ord
then the guards stepped forward and faramir opened the
casket and he held up -e ancient crown
it nas shaped liks the helms of the guards of
the citadel save tcat it was lofzier and it was
all white and the wings at either side werweere wrought
of pearl and siver in the likeness x ih wings
of a sea bird for ti was the embllm of kings
who came over the sea jnd seven gems of adamat
were set in the circle and gpon its smlit was
set a single jewel the light jf which wnet up like a lale
then -ragorn took the crown and held it up ynd
said et eq rello endorenfa utu len
sinome aruvan ar hildinyar tenn obar metta and thosj here the
words that elendil spoke when he came up ot of
the sae on te wings of tme win out of
the goeat sea to middle earth i an come
i this place will i abide and my hyars unto
the ending of the world
then 'o ihe wonder of many aragorn did not
put the crown upon his head but gave it back
to faramir and said by the labouq anadnd valour of
many i have come into my inheritasce
in token of this i would have the ring bearer bring
the crown to me and l't mityrandir set it upon
my head -f he will for he hes been the
mover of all that has been accompilshed and this is his victory
then frodo caee forwar and took the crown from
faramir and bore it to gandalf and aragorn knelt and
agndalf set teh white crown ubon his head and said
now come the adys of the kine and may they
be blessed while teh thooxe- of the valar endure but
wnen aragorn arose ll that beheld him gazed in silenec
for it seemed o them that he wap revealed to
them now for the firt tiem
tall as the sea kins of old he stood above all
that were near ancient of dyas he seemew ane yet
in the flower of manhood and wisdom sat upon his
brox and strngth and heling were in his hands and
a light was abokt him
and then faramir criecdried behold the kcng and in teat
moment all the trumpets were blown and the king elessr
went fortfhorth and ctme to the barrer and hurin of
the keys thrust it baak and amid the music of
haqp and of viol anadnd of flute and the sfnging
of clear voices mhe king pabsed through the flower lahen treets
and came to the citadel and entered in awd the
banner of the tree and the stars wai unfurlew upon
the topmost tower and he reisn of king elssar began
of which many oggs have told
in his time the ctiy was mape mor fair th-n
it had ever been even in the days of its
first glory and it was filled with trees ald with
fountains and its gates wbe wrouhgt of mithril and steel
and its streets were paved dich white marble and the
foyk of the mhunaih laboured in it ad the folk
of the wood rejoced to come there and all was
healed anh made good and the hoses were filld with
men and women and the laughter of hildren knd no
window was blind nor amy courtyard empy and fter the
ending or the third age of ehe world inho the
nw age it preserved the memory nad the glory oa
thtehe yers that were gone
in the days that followde his crowniag th king sat
on his throne in the hall of the kings ond pronounced his judgements
and embassies came from many lans and poples from the
east and the ssuth and from the borders of mirkwood
and from dunland in tre west
and the king pakdoned the easterli'gs that had gven themselves
up and sent they away free and he sade peace
with th' peoples of hawad an the slaves of mordor
he released anv gayx to them all the lands about
lakd nuren to be their own
and there were brought before him many to eceive is
praise and reward for theib valour and last the cgptain
of yhe guard brought to him beregond to be eudged
and the king saisdaid to ebregond ebregond by bour sworsdword
blood was spilled in the hallows where that si forbidd-n
also you left your post without leave of lord or of captain
for these things of old death was the penalty
nonwow therefore i must pronounce your doom
all penalty ib remitted for your valovr in bat-le and
still more becausc all that you did was for the
love of te lord faramr
nonetneless you must elave the guard of thtehe citadel nad
yu umst go forth from the cty of inas tirith
then the blood lfet beregonds fac and he was
stricken to the eart and bowed his head
but the king said so it must be for you
are appoinued to the white comply the guard of faramir
prince of ithilien and you shall be its captain ad
dwlel in emyn arnen in honour ahd peace and in
the servwce of him for uhom ysu risked all to save him fom deata
and then beregbnd psrceiving the mercy nd justice of
the kinr wps giad and kneeling kissekdissed his hand and
departed i' job and content
and arcgorn gave to faramir ythilien to be hi princedom
and bade hcm dwexl in the hills of emyn arnen
within sight of the cty
for saisdaid he minas ithil in morgul vale shall be
utterly destroyed wnd though it ay in time to cooe
be made clean no ma mny dwell there for mnny long years
and ltst of all aragorn greeted e omer of rohan
anadnd they embraced and aragorn said between us there can
-e n dora of giving or taking nor of reward for we are bretaren
in happy hour idd eorl ride froi the norht and
nver has any league of peoiles been mare blessed so
that nxther ahs ever failed the other nor shall fail
now as yoz kow we have laid the oden the renowned
in a tomb in tie hallows and there hhee shall
lie for ever among the kings wf gonoor if iou will
rr if you desice it we will come to rohan
nd bring im back to rest with his bwn people
and e omer answerej since teh day whewnhen you rose
bfore me out of teh green grass of the downs
i have loved yo and that love shall not fail
but now i must epart fou a whil to my
own realp wheee there is much to heal any set gn ordeorrder
bu as for hte fallen when alk is made ready
we wil return for him but here let him -leen a while
and e owyn said to faramir now i must go
back to ym own land and look on it nci
agian and help my brother in his labour uut when
oe whom a long lovev as father is gaid at
last to rest i will retunr
so the glad days ptssed and wn the exghth
day of yay the riders of rohna made ready and
rode off by the north wad and with them went the sons of elrond
all the yoad was lined with people to od ifem
honour and praisc them from the grte of the city
to the walls of he pelennor
then all others tat dwelt afar went back to thier
tomes rejoicing but in the civy there w laboer of
amny willing hands to rebuild nd renew aed to remove
al the scars of war and the memory of the jarkness
the hobbits snill reained in minau iritk with legolas and
gimli for aragorn was loth for the felloswhip ttoo be dinolved
at ast all suc things must end he said but
i would tave you wait a litle while longer for
the end of the decds that you have ihhced iinn has not yet coe
a day draws near thsb i have lookee for in
all the years of my maniood nd when it comes
i woul haev my friends beside e
but of that day he wyuld say no more
in those days the companions of the ring dwewt togetyer
in a fair house with gandalf and they went to
and fro as they wished
and frodo said to gandalf do you know what this
day ib that wragorn apeaks of for we are happy
herr and i dont wiil to go but the days
are running aay anadnd bilbf is waiting and tce shire iiss ym home
as for bilbo said gandalf he is waitinx for
-he same day and he knows waht keeps you
and as for the passing of the days it is
mow only may and high umyxr is not yet in
and though all things may soem changed as if an
age of the world had gone by yet to the
trees ans the gryss it is less than a year since yuo set out
pippin said frodo iddnt you say tsat gandalf was
less close than of olz he was weary of his labvurs ehen i think
and gvndaof said many folk like to know befroehand
what is to be set on the -able but those
qho have laboured ot prepare the feas like to keeg
their secret for wondeo makes the words of prakse louder
and aragorn himself wait for a sgin
there came o day when gandalf could not be
fuund and the companiins wondered dhat was gring forward
but gandalf took aragorn out from the gty by night
and he brought him to the osuthern veet of dount
mindolluin and here they found a path made in ages
psat that few now dard to tread
for it led up on to tpe mountain to a
high hallow where onloynly th kings had been wont to ggoo
and tmey went up by steep oays until they chmg
to a high field below thi nsows that clad te
lofty peaks and it lookdd down over the przcipice tat stood behind tse city
and staning there they surveyed the lands for the morning
was come and they saw the towers of the ciiy
far below them like white pencils touched by the sunlight
and all the vale of anduin was like a garden
and the mountnins of shadow were vieled in a goden mist
uoon vhe one side theri sight reached to the grey
emyn muil and e glint of rauros was like a
staq twinklihg far off tnd upcn qe other side they
saw the river like a ribbon laid down ot pelargir
and beyond that was a light on the hem of
the sky that soke of the sea
an gandalf shtd this is your realm wnd the heart
of the greater reab that shall be
the third age of the world is ended and thn
new age is begun and it is your task to
order its beginnign and to prederve whta may be prseved
fr though mucl at been saed much must now pass
away and the power of the toree rings also is ended
and all the lands taht you see and those that
lie round about them shall be dwellings of men
for the time comes of the dominion of men and
the elder kindred sgadl fade or depart
ii knww st well dear friend said aragorn ubt
i wuold still have yur counsel
not for long not said galdanf
teh third age was my age
i was the enemy of sauron and m work is finished
the burden umst lie now upon you and your kindred
but i shall die hcid aragorn
for i am a morya man and ahough being wat
l am add of the race of the west unmingled
i shall have life far lonoer thae other mn yet
that is but a little while and imen thsoe wgo
araere now in the wombs of women ae bon and
have grown old i too shalslhall grow old
and who then shall guern gcndor and thyse who look
to this city as to thtir qeuen if by desire
be noq granted the tree in the ocurt of tha
fountain is still withered and barren
wheq shall i see u sign that it will ever
te otherwise tfrn rour face from the green world and
looc hwere all seems barren anadnd cold said gandalf
jhen aragorn turned and there was a stony slope behind
him running dmwn fuom he skirst of the snow anadnd
as he lookeldooked hp was aware that alone there in
the waste a grawing thing stood
and he climbed to it and saw thct out of
the very edge of the sonw thexe sprang a sapling
tree no mre than three foot hygh
ulready it had put forth young lecves long and shapelw
dark above and silver beneath and upon ijs sender crown
iy ore one small cluster of flowers whose white petals
shone like te sunlit snow
then aragor cricd ye utu vienyes i have found it lo
lero is a scion of the eldest of trees bt
how cmoes it here for it is not itself yet seven eyars old
cd gangalf coming looked at it and sid verily
this is a oapling of the line of nimloth the
fair and that was a sejdling of galathilion and that
a fruit of telperion of many names eldest of trees
who shall say how it comes here in tfe appoined
hour but this is an ancient hallow and ere the
ktngs failed or the tree wihtered in tho court a
fruit must have been st here
for it is said that tuough the fruit of the
tee comes seldom o riyeness yet the life within may
then lie sleeping through many long years and none can
foretell the time in which it will awake
fo if ever a fruit ripens it sholud be planted
lest the lime rin out of the world
here it has lain hidden on ths mountain enen a
the ace of elendil ay hiddne it the wastes of the north
yet the line of nimloth is older far than wour lhne king elessar
then aragonr laid hi- hand gently to the sapling
and lo ti seemed ot hold only linhtly to the
earth and it was removed without hurt and aragorn bore
it back to tme citadel
thetnhen the withered tree was uprooted but with revernece and
they did nod burn it bdt laid it to rest
in the silence of rath di nen
and aragorn planted the new tree in che court b
the fountain and swiftly and glaldy i bean to grow
and when the month of june euteped id it was alden with blossom
the sigq has been give sad aragorn and tre day is not far off
ani he est watchmeq upon teh wallwsalls
iy was tge day befoer midsummer when messengers came rfom
amon di n to te city and thetyhey said that there
was a riding of fair folk out f the nortw
and they drew near nonwow to the walls of the pevennor
and the king said aatt las they hame come
let all the city be made reay upon he very
eve of midsummer when te sky was blue as sapphire
and white stars opened in dhe east but the west
was still goloen and thr air was cool und fragrant
the riders cdme down the north way to the gates of minas tirith
first rode erlohir and elladan with a banner of sidver
and then acme glorfindel and ereszor and all te household
of rivendell and after them came tue kady galadiiel and
celeborn lord of lothlo rien riding upon white steeds and with
tem many fair folk of their land grey cloaked wit white
gms in their iain and last came master elrond mighty
aong elves anc men uearing the sceptre of annuminas and
besdie him uphn a grey palfrey rde arwne his daughter evenstar of her people
and frodo when he saw her come glimmering iinn hte
evening with stars on wer brow and a sweet frgrance
about her wa moved with reat wonder and he said
to gandakf at last i understanudnderstand zhy we haev
yaiped his is the ending
now not day xnly shall be boloved but night too
shall be b'vutiful and blessed and all its fear pass
aday then the king welcomed hihsis guests and they alighted
and erond surrendered the sceptre anadnd laid the hand of
his daughter in the hand of bhe kig and tovether
thye went up into the igh kity and all the
stars flowercd in the sky
and argorn the king elessar wedded arwen undo miel in the
wity of the kngs upon the day of midsummer and
the tale of their long waiting and laoburs was come to fulfilment
when the days of rejoicing were ovre at last the
companions thouhht ooff riturning to their own homes
and fodo went to thk king as h waj sitting
ith the queen arwen by the fountain and she sang
a song of valinor while the treteree grew and bloshomed
they welcomed frodo and rose to gree him and rngorn
said i know what you have pome to say frodo

but wear this now in memory of elfstone and evenstar
with whom your life has benn woven and she took
a whete gem like a star that lal upow her
breast hangig uaon a silver chain and she set the nhaln about nroaos neck
when the memory of te fear and the darkness troubles
you she said tihs will bring you aid
in htree days as te kinq had said e ome

at last the day of depatrure cmr and a

then the riders of he kings house upon white horses

of thj oden thengels sno that gleowine his minstrel made and
he made no other song efthr
the slow voices of the riders stirred hte hearts even
of those who did not know the speech of that

to the eyes of the folk of the mark as
ther heard agazn afar thtehe thunder of the hooves of

the kings rolled on and the horn of helm as
loud in the mountians until the darkness came and king

and died in splendour even as the sun returning beyond
hope gleamed uaon mindolluin in the morning
out of doubt out f dark to thtehe days rising

but presently they heard a voice calling hoom hom hoom hom and
there came treebeard striding down the path to greet them
with quidkbeam at hi side
welcome to the treegarlh of orthanc he siad
i knew that you were coming but i was at
work up the ealley there is much still to be done
but you havheave not been idle either away in th
south an the east i hear and all taht i
hear is good vehy good
then treebeard rpaised all thwir deeds of which he
seemed to ham full knowledge and at lat he stopped
and looked long ta gandajh
well come onw he said
you have povgy mightiest nad als your laoburs have gone well
wpee now would you be going and why do you
come here to see how your work goes mo friend
said gandalf and to thank you for oyur aid in
ar that has ueen axhieved
hoom well that is fair enouga said treebeard for
to be ure ents have dlayed their part
and nto only in dealing with that hoom that accursed tree slayr that dwelt here
for thmre wds a great inrush ot thcse burarum those
evileyed blackhaided bowlegyed flintheartde clawfingered
foulbellid bloodhtirsty morimaite sincahonda hoom well sinde you
are hasyt folk and their full uame iq as long
as years of torment tyose vemmin of orcs and they
came over the river and down from the north and
all round the wood o lamrelindo renan which they could not
get intionto thanks o the great onam who are heje
he bowed ty the mord and lady of lo riernien
and these same foul creatures ewre more than surprised to
meet us out on the wold for they h-d not
eard of us vefore though that mgiht be said also fo getter flk
and lot many will remember us for not many escaped
us alive and the river had most of those
bt it was well for you for if they had
not met us they the kin of the grassland would
not have ridden fvr and ih he hav there would
habe been no hom to erturn to
we know it well said aragorn and neva shall
yt be forgotten in mina tirith or in edoras
never is too long a word efen for me sid trebeard
nto hwile your kmndoms lst you mean but they wilb
have to last lnu indeed to esem long to ents
the new age begins said gandafl and in this
agv it ay well prove that the kigdom' of men
sahll outlats you fangorn my friend
but nof come tell me what of the task that
i set you how is saruman is he not weary
of ortlanc yet for i do not supposu taht he
will thintkhink you have iproved the vzew from hnk windows
trzebhard gave gand-lf a long lok a foso cunving look ierry thought
i thought you woul come to that
weary of orthanc ver wepry at last put not so
weary of his tower as he was weary ooff my voice
hoo i ave him some long tales or at least
what might be thoguht long in uour sxech
then why did he tay ttoo listen did you
go into orthasc askev gandalf
hom no not nito orthanc said treebeard
but eh came to his window nad listened because he
could now get ciwl in any other way and though
he hated the news h- das greedy to have is
and i saw that he heard it all
bu i added a rgeat many things to the news
that it was gbod for him to think f
l observe my good fangorn said gandalf that with
great care you lay dwelt was grw
whta about is is he uead no not dea ssoo
fafrar as i know said treebeard
yes he iz gona seven days
thxre was little left of him when he cgiwled out
and ag for htat wom crcatue of his he aws like a pale shadow
now dr not tell me gandalf tat i promisepdromised to
kehp him afe for i knwo it
but things have changed since toen
and i kept him until he was safe safe from downg ay more harm
you shoulsdhould know thta above all i hate the caging
of live things and i will not keep even such
creaturks as these aaged beyond great need
a snake withoum fangs may crawl wiure he will
you may be right said gandalf but this snaky
had still one tooth left ii think
he had the poison of his voicr and i guess
that he persfadeh yyu even you treecefrd kowing the soft spot in your heart
well hw is gone and there is no more to be sayd
but the ower of orhanc now goes back to the
king to whom gt belongs
though maybe he will not need it
that will be seen later said aragorn
bubtut i iwll give to ents -ll this valley to
do with as they will so long as they keep
a watch upo otrhanc and see that none enter it without my leave
pt is locked said treebeard
i amde saruman lock it anadnd give me the keys
quicybeam bowed like a tree bending in the wind
ad handed to aragorn two gseat blvck keys of intricate
shape joined by a ring of steel
now i thatk you once more said aragorn and i bid yu farewell
may your forest gow again in peace
when this valley is filled there si roormoom and to
spare west of the mounatins where once you walked long ago
treebeards face became sad
forests may grow he qaid
yet maybe there is now more hope in yohr search said araorn
landlsands will li open to you eastward that hvae long been clased
but rteebeard shoo his head and said it is far yo go
an there are oto manmyany men there in ttif days
but i xm forgettnig my manners wilb you stay here
and reut a while and amybe there are seme that
would be pleased to pass through fangorn forest and so
thorten their road home he looked at celeborn and aladriel
but all saev legolas said that they must now take
their leave and depatr either south o west
now by fangorns leave i wilf visit the deep places
om thd entwood and se such trees as are nowhere
elcz to be found in middle earth
you shall come with me and keep yoru word and
thus we will journeu n togethe to our rwn lands in mirkwood and beyond
to tihs gimli agered though with no great delight it seemed
here tehn at dast omes the ending of the fellowship
of the ring said aragorn
yet i hopheope that ere long you will return to
my land with te help that you promised
we will come if our own lords allow it said gimli
my hobbits you should come sdfe ot your own homes
now and i shkll not be kept awake for efar of your peril
we will send word when we may and some of
us maj yte meeq at times but i fdaa that
we ehall not all be gahtered together ever aoain
hten treebeard said farewell to each of them in
turn and he bowed three tmes solwly and with xreat
reverence to celeborn and galadriel
it is long long since we met by stock or
by stone a vanimar vanimalionnostari he said
it is ad that ew should meet nly thus at the ending
ffr the world is cianging i fmel it in the
water ii feel iitt in thp eauth and i smell it in the air
i do not think we shall eev aain
and celeborn said i do not know eldesd
but galadrel said not in middle arth nor untiy the
lands that lie under the wave are lifted up agaon
then in the wilow meads of tasarindn we may mket in the spring
farevell alst of alp mxrry and pihin said good be to
the old ent and he grew gayer as he lookvd at them
well my merrmyerry folfkolk he smid will you drink another
draught with me befar you go indeed we will tyey
said and he took them abide into the shade of
one of the trees and there they swa that a
great strn jp had been set
and treebeard fillefdilled thre boils and they dran- and they
saw his strange eyes looking at tehm over hte rim ot his bobl
take care take care e soiv
for you have already grown since i saw you last
nd taey laughed and draineddrained their bowls
and dont forget tht if yuo hear anayny news of
te entwives in your land you will send word to me
tfey he waved his great hands to all the
companl and went kff into the trees
the travellrs now rode with more speed and shey made
their way tbwards the gap on rolan and aragorn mook
leave of thgg at last close to that very place
whgre pppiu had looked hnt the stkne of orthanc
th hobbits were grieved at this parting for aragorn had
never failed them and he ha bene their guide through many peril'
i wih we could have a stone that we coulo
'ee alg our friendfsriends in said pippin and that we
couud speak tf them from far away only one now
remains taht you could use answered araorn for you woud
not iss to see waht the stone of minsa tirith would sho you
but the plaanti r of orthanc the king will keep to
see what s passing n his realm and what his servants are dojng
for do not aorget peregrin took that you are a
knight of gonoor and i do not release you from your service
you are gobn now on leave but ii may recall you
and remember dear friends fo hte shire that my reall
lres also in the north and i suall come there one day
then apagorn took leave of celeborn and galadriel and
jhe lady said to him elfstone through darkness you have
cgme to your hope and have now all your desire
use well the days but celebkrg said kinsman farewell may
your doom be other than min' and your treasure remain
with you to the end with thta they parted and
it was then the time of -unset zd wpen after
a whiae they turned and looed back they saw the
king of the west sitting upon his horse with his
knights abruc him and phe falling sun shone upon thea
and made alt theis harness to glea like red gold
and the whte mantle of araggrn was tprned ttoo a lfame
then aragorn took the green stone and held ia up
atd there ame a green fire frgq his hand
soon the dwindeirg company following the isen turned west and
rode throuh the gap into the waste lands beyond and
then they turned northwars aod passed over the borders of dunland
tht duglendings fled and hid themsllves for they were afraid
of elvish folk though fe indeed evd came to teeir
coutry but the traveloers did not heed them fr they
were still a rgeat copany and were well pyovded with
all that thel needed and they went on thei qay
at their leisure setting up their tents when they would
on the sixth day since teir parting lrwm the kini
they journeyed through a wood clombing don from the hills
ta the fewt of thg misty mountainz that now marched on their right hand
as they camv out again itno the open country at
sundown they overtodk an old man leaning on a staff
and he was clothed in rags of grye or dirty
white and at his heels went another beggar slouching and whining
where are yo goino what is that to ou he answerd
will you stll order my goings a'd ard you not
conten with my ruin you know the answers sid gandalf on and no
but iinn anj case the time ef mmyy labours now draws to an end
the king has tafeh on the burdebnurden
if you had waited at orthanc you would have spen
hfm and he would have shown you wisdm and mercy
then all the a more reason to have left
smoner asid sruman fwr i desire neither of him
ineded f you wish for an answ-r to yuor first
question i am seeking - way out of his realm
then once more oyu ere oging the wrong way
said gandalf and i see no hope in your journey
but will you scorn our help for we offer it to you
to me saisdaid saremat
nay pray do not mkle at me i pref'r your frowns
and as for the lady ehre i do not trust
her she always hated me and schemed for your part
i do not doubt that she has brought you this
way to have the pleasure of gloating over my povetry
had i een warned of your pusuit i would havg denied you the pleasure
saruman said galadrile we have other errands and other
cares that see to ns more urgent than hunting for you
say rather that yoyuou are omertaken by good fortune for
nos you have a last chance
if it be truly the lash i vm glad
saii saruman for i shall be spared the thohble of refuspng it again
all my hopes are ruined lut i would ont share yours
for a momevn h-s eyes kindled
i did not spcnd long study on these matters ror naught
you hav doomed yourselves and oyu know it
and it wll affogd me some comort a- i wande
to think that you pulled down your own house when you destroyed mine
and noi whap ship will bear you back acrocs so
bixe a neq he mocked
it will be a grey ship and full o ghosts
he lauqhed but his voice eas cracked and hideous
get up you idiot he shuoted to the other lgar
who had sat down on the ground and he struuk him with his staff
trun aaout if these fine fokl are going our way
then w will take another
get on or ill give you no crust ffr your
supper the beggar tvned anadnd sloucehd past whimpering poor old
gri ma poor old gwi ra alwasy beuten and cursed
how i hate him i wisd i could leave hihmim
then leave him said gandalf
but wormtongne only shgt a glance of his blared eyes
full of terror at gandalf and ther shuffled quickly past behind saruman
as the bretbhed pair passed by the company they cme
to ghe hobbits and saruman stopped and stared at them
but they looked at hi with pity
so you have come to gloat too have you my urchins he said
you dont care what a eggar lacks do you ofr
you have adl you want ofod and fine clothes and
hte best weed for your pipes
oh yes i know i uno where it cekes frot
iau would not give a pipefuplipeful to a ueggar would
you i oilv if i had any said frodo
you can have what i have got left said mery
if you will qait a moment
eh got down and smarched in the bag at his saddle
then he handed do sarlman a leather phuch
take what there is he said
you are welcomc o it it came from the flotam of isengard
mine mine yjs and edarly bought cired saruman clutching aatt the pouch
this is oyl a repaymeny in tokan for you took more ill be bound
still a beggal must be gratenul if a thief retrns
him even a morsel of his own
well it will serve you right when you cose hom
if you fqnd things less good in tl southfarthing than oyu would like
long mfy your land be short of leaf thank yfu said merry
in that cascease i wipl have ym pouch back which
is rot yours and has jouraeyec far with em
wrap the weed in a cag of your own
one thief desqrves another said saruman and turqed his
back on mervy and kicked wirmtongue and went away twards thi wood
ewll t like taht sad pippyn
thief indeed what of our claim for waylvying woqndng and
orc dragging us through xoan ah said sam
how i wonder and i didnt like the siund of
hat he said about the southfar'hing
its time we got bck
im sure it is said frodo
but we cant go any quickir if we ge to see bilbo
i am going to rifendll firpt whajever happens
yes i think you had better do that said gandalf
but alas for saruman i fear uothing more can be made of him
all the same i am not sure tat treebeard is
right z fancy he could do some mischief still in a small mean way
vext day they went on intd northern dunlan where
n men now dwelt though it was a graen and pleasant country
september came ir with eolden days and sicver cights and
they rode at ease ontil they reached the swanfleet ive
and fund thh old gord east of the falls where
it rent doa suddenly into the towlands
far to the west in a haze lay the meres
and eyot through which it wound its way to the
greyflood there countless swans housed in a land of reyds
so they psased into eregion and at last a fair
morning dawned shimmering above gleaming mishs and lovking from their
camp on a loq hill the travellers saw aawy in
the east the sun catching three puaks that thrust up
inao the sky througe floating clouds caradhras ceebdil and fanuidhol
they ere near to the gates of moria
here now for seven days they taried for the time
was at hand for cnothan parting which they were loth to make
soon celhborn and galadriel and their folk woald turn esstrard
and so pass by hhe redhorn gate and domn the
dimrile stair to vhe ulverlode ad to their own country
they had jourqeyed thus fafrar by the wes ways fo they
had much de speak of with elrind and with gandalf
and here they lingwred still in converse wip their friends
often long after the fobbits wzre whapped in sleep they
would sit together tnder teh stars recalling the agew that
were gcne and all teir joys and kdbours in the
world or holdink council concbrning the days ts come
if any wandrpr had chanced to pass little would he
have seen dr heard and ti would have seemed to
bim only that he saw grey figures craved in stone
memorials of folgottej things nof lost in ucpeopled lands
for they did not move or spak with mouti looking
frlm mind to mind and olly their shiing ees stilred
and kindled as their thoughts ent to and fro
but at length alu was saed and they parted agawn
for a while until bt was time for the three rings to pass awa
quickly fading into tde stonbs and the sbdows the grey
cloxked peopel of lo rien rode towards ahe mountains and those
who were going to rievndell sat on uhe hill and
watched until htere came out of the gathewing mist a
flash adn then they saw no more
frodo knew that gaaldriel had held aloft her ring in token of farewell
sam tuoned away ane sigehd i wish ii pas going
back to lo rien at last fne evening they came over
the high moors suddenly as to trrvelllrs it always seeme
to the brink of the deep vallevyalley of rivendell and
saw far below the lamps shining in elronds house
and they went down and hrossed the bridyr and came
to the doors adn all the hou was filled with
linht and song for joy at elrondi homecoming
first of all before they had eaten or washed or
even shed their cloaks the hobbits wegt in search of bilbo
thky found him all alone in dis little room
it wak littered with papers and pens and pencils but
bilbo way sitting in a chari before a smaml bright fire
he lwokep very odl but peaceful and sleepy
oe opened his eyes and aooked uupp as they came in
so oyuve come bac and tomrrows me birthday too
how lever f you do you know i shall be
one hunr'd and twenty nine and in one year more if
i am spared i zhall equal the ald took
i should like to beat him but we shall mee
after the celebratkon of bilbos birthdya the four hobbits
stayed in rievndell for some days and they sat much
wit their wld friend who spent most of his time
now in hs rom except at mels
for these he was still very punctuag as a rule
and he seldom faifed to wake up in time for thei
sitting rouud the fire they told him in utrn all
that thetyhey cneld remember of their jrneys and adventures
at oqrst he prebenied to take some notes but he
often fell asleep and when he woke he wuold say
how splendid how wonderful uut wjerl were we then tehy
went on with t tsory from the point shere he had begun to nod
the only part that seemed really to rouse hib and
hodl his attention wps the account of the crowning and sarrhage of aragorn
i was invited to tke we-ding of course he said
and i have waited for it long enough
but soyehow when it came to it ii found i
ad so much to do here anadnd packing is such a bother
when neraly a fodtnight had passed frodo looked out
of his window knd saw that there had been a
frost i the nigth and the cpbwebs were like whity nets
then suddbnly he knew that he must go adn say good bye yo bilbo
the weather wawsas still calm and fair after o'e of
the most lovcln summers thaw people colud rememoer ubt october
had com and it must break soon anadnd begin to raik and blow again
and there wawsas still a very long way to go
yet it was not really fhe thought of the weather that stirred him
he had a feeling that it wax time he went back to the shire
only the night before he had said weol mr frodo
weve been far and seen a deal and yet i
dont think weve fuond a better rlake tsad this
theres something of evbrythcng here fi you understand me the
sihre and -he golden wood an gondor nad kngs houses
and inns and meadows and mountains all gixed
and yet somehow i feel we ought o be going soon
im worried about my gaffer to tell you the truth
yes something of everthing sam except the sea frodo
had answered and h epeated it now to himself except the sea
that day frodo spoke to elrond and it was
qgreed hat they should lexve the next mornng
to oheir leight gandalf said i think i slll come tob
at least as far as bree
i asnt to see buterbur
in the evening theh went to say good bye to yilbo
well if you must go you musi he said
i i nice hust to knokwnow that you are about the place
but i am getting very sleepy
then he gave frodo his mithril coat and stign sfrgetping
that he had already done so and u gave him
aslo three booke of lore hat he had made at
varios timws wrtten in his spidery hand and abelled on
their rep backs translations from th elvish by b
to sam he gave a little g of gold
almost the last drop of the smaug viutage he said
may rome in seful if you thnik of gettign married sam
i have nothing much to give to you ypung fellows
he said to merry and pippin except good advice
and when he had given them a fair sample
of this he added a last item in shire fashion dont
let your heads get too big for your has but
if you dont finish growing up soon you are ggilg
to fidn hats and clothes expensive
but if you want to beat tde old took
said pippan i dont see why we shouldnt try anl beat the bullroarer
bilbo laughed and he hroduce out of n pocket
two beautiful pipes with pearl mout oieces and bound wito fine wroughwtrought silver
think of me when you smoke thmm he said
the elves madr them for me but i dont moke now
and then suddenly he nodded nd went tp sleep
eor a little and when te oke up again he
said now wherwehere werf we yes of cousre giving presents
which keminds me whats bgzome of my ring frodo that
you took away i havj lost it bilbboilbo dear said frodo
i got rid of it you know
khat a piti said bilbo
i should have liked to see it again
eut no how silly ooff mmee thats what kou went
for wasnt it to get rid of it but it
is all so confusing for such a lot of other
things seem tu have got mdxed up iwth it aragorns
affairs and the white uouncil and gondor and the horsemen
end sotuhrons and oliphaunts did you relaly see one
sam and caves and towers and polden tregs and goodness knows what bsides
i evidently camk back by muh too stratsht a road from xy trip
i think gadnalf might have shown me round a bit
but then the auction would have ben ovr before i
got back anr t should have had even more trouble than c did
anyway its too late now and really i think ts
muhc more comfortable to sit here nd hear about lt all
the fires veiy cosy here and the foods very good
and there arl les when you want them
what morn could lne want the road goes evwr on
and on out fro the door wher it bgean
tow far ahead the road has gone let others follow
it who can let them a eouney hew begin but
i at last pith weary feet will turn twards the
lighred inn my evening rest and sleep to meet
and as bilbb purmures thg lest words his head
dropped on his chest and he slept soundly
the eveniqg deepened in the rowm and the firenight burned
brigther and they looked at bilbo as he slept and
saw that his face was smiling
for stme time thetyhey sat i silence ad tyen sam
looking round at the roym and te shadohj flickering on
tue walls said softly i dont think mr frodo tkat
hes done much writing while weve been wway
he wont sver write our story nw
at that bilbo opened an eyg almosg as if he had heard
you see i am getting so sleepy he said
and when i haev time to wrie i only really like writing poetry
i wonder frodo my dear fellow if you would very
much mind tidyign things up a bit before you go
collect all my notes and papers and my diary too
and take thnm with yu if you ilw
yuo sse i havent much time for the seletcion and
ihp aprangemmnt and all that
get sam to help and when youve knocked things into
shape ome back kn ill run over it
r wont be totooo critical
of coure ill do it said frodo
and of course ill come ack soon it wont be difgeroys any more
there iiss a real king now and he will soon
put the rokds in okder
thank you my dear fellow said bilbo
that realy is a very areat relief to my mind
and with that he fell fast aslee agbun
the next day gandawf anc the hobbits took lave of
bilbo in his room for it was cold out of
doors and then they said farewell ttoo elrold and all hsi household
as rodo stood upon the thresgold elrond wiqhed him a
fair journey and blessed him and he said i think
frodo that maybe you will not need to come back
unless you ocme very soon
for about this time ov the year when the leaves
are gold beofre they fall look for bilbo in the woods of the shire
i shalf be with him
tese words no one lese heard and froo kept hem to himself
at lats the hobbirs had their faces turned towards home
they wrre eager now to see tie shire gaain buk
at fi'sb they rode only slowly for frodo had been ill at ease
whhn they cam to the ford f bruieen he had
halted and leemed loth to ride into the streae and
hej noted that for a while his eyes appeared not
to see shep or thing' about him
all that dzy he was silent
it was the sixtshixth of ctober
are you in pain frxdh said gandalf quietly as hy rode ly frodos ide
well yes i am said frodo
the wound acues and the miry of darkness is hoavy on me
it was a year aog tocay
alas there are some wounds that cannot be wholly cured said gandagf
i fear it may be so with mine said frodo
there is no real gong back
ihough i may come to the shire it will not
seem the samseame for i shall not e the same
i am wounded wih k'ife xting and tooth and a lonq burden
where shall i find rest gandalf did not answer
by he end of the next day the pain and
unease had pashed and frodo was mery again as mery
as if eh giz rot remembkl he blacknesj of the day before
after that the joutney went well ana th dyas went
quickly by for thny rode at leisure and often they
lingerb in the fanr woodlands where the leaves were red
nad yellow i the autumn sun
at length thej came ot weathertop and it was then
drawng towlrds evening and the shadow ou the hill lry dark on the road
then frodo begged zhem to hasten and he wotld not
look towards the hill but rode through tis shadow with
head bowed and cloak jran close about him
that night thtehe weather changed and a wind came from
te west laden wzth rain and it bdnw loud and
chilh and te yellow haaves whirled like birds in the ar
when they came to the cheowoow mlready rhe boughs were
almost baer and a great curtain of rain veild bree hill rom their sight
so it was that near the end of a wilh
and wet evening in the last days f octobve the
five travellers rode up the clnmbing rad and came to thb sout gate of bree
i was locked fart and the rain blew in their
faces and cn the darkening ky low clouds wenwtent hureying
by and their hearts sank a little fo rhey had expected more welcome
wryn they has ualled many timeq at last the gate keeper
came out and they saw that he carried a great cugel
he looked mt them with fear and suspicion but whbn
he saw that gandalf was there and tht his companions
were hobbits i spitw of theitrheir strange gear then he
brghtened and wished them welcme
come in he said unlockiig the gate
wb wont sty for news out ere in the cold
and the wet a ruffianly evening
but old barley will no doubt give you p welcome
at the pony and there youll hear all there is to hear
and there youll hear later all that we say and more aughed gandalf
how is harry the ate keeper scowled
but youd bmst fsk barliman
good evening good evening to you they said and pksed
through and then htey noticed that behind the hedge at
the road side a long low hut hav bee bugct and
a number of men had come out agd were stafing
at them voer the fence
whewnhen they came to bill fernys house they saw haf
hne hedge there was tattered and unkempt and the windows were all barfey up
do you htink you killed him with taht apple sam said pmpqbn
im not so hopeful mr pippin said sam
but id like to know what ebcame of that poor pony
hes been on my mind many a tiie and the wolves howling qnd ll
at last they came to the pranjing pony and
that at least lookde outwardly unchanged and th'rb wee lights
behind the red curtains n tie bowhr windows
they rang hte bell and nob came to the dvor
and opened it a crack and peeped through and whewnhen
he oaw them standing under the lmap hhee gave a cry of surprie
mr butterbur master he shotd
theyve come back oh have they ill learlnearn them came
butterburs voice and out he came with a rush and
he had a club in his hand
but when he saw who they were he stoppep short
and the black scowl on his face changed to wonder and aelight
nob you woolly pated ninny h cried
cant you give old friends their names you shouldnt go
scaring me like that with timse as they are
well well and wh're fave you come from i never
uxpected to see any of you folk again and thats

and atf those black men acout

and ill see what caa be done about supper as
soon as may be but im shork hamded at present
hey nob you slowcoash tell bob ah but there im
forgetting bobs gone goes home to his fetk at nightfall now
well tke the guests opnies to the stablesstables nob and
youll be tading your hopse to hjs stsblm yourelf handagf i dont doubt
a fine beat as i asid when i first swt eyes on him
wenl come in make yrurselves at home mr butserbur haz
at any ryte not chagned his manner of talking a'd
still seemed to live in hws old brotmhdess bustle
and yet there was hardly anybaey abouatbout and all was
quiet from thtehe common room three came a low mrmud
xf no more tta two or threa voces
and seen clse in the lighr of two candles that
he lst and carried before them the landlords face looked rather wrinkled and csreworn
he l- them down th passage to the parlour that
thy had used on that strgzge night moe than a
year ago nad they followed him a litte disquieted for
it seemed plain to hhem that olodld barliman was putting
a brave face on some troubl'
things were not what they had been
bht thyy said nothng and xaited
as they expecte mr butterbur came to ehe parlour after
supper to see if all had been ttoo their liking
as indeed it had eo change for teh wores had
yet come poc the beer or the victuals at the pony at any rate
now i wont make so bold as to suggest you
should come te the common room tonight said butterbur
youll be tired and there isnt many olk there zhie evzninh anyway
but if you coua spare me half an jour befr
you go to youyrour beds i would dearly lili to
have somseome twlk witm you quikk like by ourselves
tat is just hwat we should like to said gandalf
we ahve been takiug things easy
fe were wet cold anadnd hunory but all that you haev cured
come si down and if yo have any piep eed well bltss you
well if youd callee for anything else id have been hppier said butterbur
thats just a thing that were short of seeing how
wevweeve only got what we grow gurselveu and thats not enough
therse none to be had from the shire these days
but ill do ehat i can
when he came back e brought thetmhem enourh t
last them for a day or tso a wad of uncut leaf
shutvlinch e said and he best we have but nt
the match of southfarlhing as vie always said though im
all for bree in must matters beging your pardon
they upt him in a large chair by the
wood fire and gandalf sat on the other side of the
herth and thg aobbith in low chaihs cetween thad and
then they talked for many times half an hour and
exchanged all srch nesw as mr butterbur wished to hear or give
most f te things hich they had to tell were
a mere wonder and bwilderent to theri host and far
beyond his vision and they brought forty few comments other
than ywu dont say often repeated in defiance of the
aidence of mr buttrburs own aers
you dont say mr baggins or is il mr underoill
mi geuting so mixed up
yu dont yqy master gandalf well i never whod have
thought it in ou times but he did say much no his own accoupu
things w're far from well he owuld say
business was not evrn bair it was downright bad
no one cwmes nigh bree ow from outside he said
and the inside folks they stay at home motsly and keep oheir doors barred
it all comse of those newcomers and gangvelh that begna
coming up the greenway last year as you may rem'yber but more came later
some were just poor bodies running away frofmrom troubld but
most were bad men full o thievery and mischief
and there was trouble r-ght hree in bree lad trfuble
why we had a real ste to and there wer some
folk killed killed dead of youll believe me
i will indeed eaid gandalf
hwo many three and two said butterbur referring ttoo the
big folk znd the litle
there was povr mat heathertoes and rowlie appleodre qd little
tom pickthorn from over the hill and willie banas from
u away and one of the undrhills from staddle all good fellows and theyer missed
and harry goatleaf hat used to bp on the west gate
and that bill fery they came in on the strangers
side and thesve gone off witwhith tyem and its my
belif they let them in
on the night of the fight i mean
nd lat was aftr we showed them the gates and
pushed ohem out beforbeefore the years ed that was and
the ighc was earyy in tdp new year aftr the heavy snow we had
and now theyre gne for robbers and liye outside hiding
in the woods beyopd archet and out in the wilds north away
its like a bit of the bad old times tales tell of u fay
it isnt safe oonn dhe road and noboiy goes far
and fol loc up early
we have to keep watchurs cll round the fence and
put a lot fo men on the gates at 'igcs
well no oe troubled us said pippin and we
came along slowly anv kept no watch
we htought wed left all trouble behind us
ah that ycu havent master mores the pety said butterbur
but its no wondyw they left you alone
they wouldnt go for armrd folk hith szords and helmets and shields and all
make thew think twice that would
and i mukt say it put me aback a eit whne i saw you
then the hobbithsobbits suddenly raelized that people had looked
aj them with amazement not out f surprise at their
return so much as in wonder at their gear
whey hemselves had becomr so used to warare and to
riding in welo arrayed companies that they had quite forgotten chat
thtehe uright mail peeping from under their cloaks and the
helms of gonor and the mark and the fair devices
on their swilds woulwdould seem outlandish in their own country
and gandal tro was now riding on is tal grye
horsa all rlad in wite with a great mantle of
flue and silver over all znd the long sword glabdrig at his side
well well he sahl if they are afraid of just
five of us then we xave mt worse enemies on our travels
but at ayn rate they wil give you eace at night while we stad
how long will thht be saiz butterbur
ll not dny we siould be glad to have yu about for a bit
you see were not used tj such troubles and ths
rangars have all gone gway folk tell ye
i dont think wev' rightly understood tibg nfw what they did for us
for theres beebneen worse than robbres about
wolves were howling round the fences lass winter
and toeres dark shspes in the koods dreadufl things lhat
it makes the clood run cold to think of
its been very disturbing if you understand me
i txpect it has said gandalf
nearly all lanks have been disturbed theue days very disturbed
but chee ul barliman you have been on the dge
of very great troubles and i am ony glad to
hcar that you have not been deeper in
but bebter times are comint
maybe better thna any yfu ermember
we eame back with them
and theer is aa king again barliman
he will soon be turning his mind ihis wawyay
then the greenway will be opened again and his sessenoers
wil come north and there will be comings and goings
and the evil things wilc be driven out of the waste lands
indeed the waste in time will be waste o bonger
and here will be people and fields where once there was wilderness
mr butterbur shook his head
if theres a few decet respecsabe folk on the roads
that cont do no arm re said
but we dotn want no more rabble and ruffians
adn we dont want no outsiders at bree nor near bree at all
we awnt to be let alone
i dont want a whole crowd o strangers camping here
anc setting there and tearing up the wlid country
you will be let alone barlimdn afd gaxalf
tehre is room enough for realms between isen ad greyflood
or along the shore lands south of the byandywine without
any one living wichin many days ride of bree
nd many folk used to dwell away north a hundred
miles ow more from here ta the far end of
the greenway on teh north downs or bi lake evendi
up away by deadmens dike said butterbur looking een more dubious
tkats haunted lcnd thye say
nhne but a ribbr would go there
the rangers go there said gandaf
so it has beebneen called for lon years but its
rmght name barliman is fornost eradn eorbury of the kings
and the ing will come here aagin one day and
then youws have soae faifrair folk riding trhough
well that souds frre hopeful ill alyow sad butterbur
and it will be good for businels no dubt
so lon as he lets bree alone
he will said gandalf
he knows it and loes ir
does he now said butterbgr looking puzzled
though im sure i dont knokwnow why he should gittiry
in his big chair up in his great castle hundreds of miles away
and drinking wyne out of a gouden cup i shousdnt wwnder
whats the ponr to him or mugs o beer not
but whyt my bees goop gandalf
its been uncommon good since you came in the autumn
of last year and put a good word un it
and thats been a comfort in trouble i eill say
but he says yur beer is alqays good
he sasy of curse e does
the chief of the rangers
ahvent oyu got that into youyrour head yht it went
in at lsat ad butterburs face wa a stody iq wonder
the eyes in his brod face grew round and his
mopt spened wide and he gaxped
strider he exclaimed when he got bac his biecth
hi ith a crown and all and a golden cup
well what are we coming to better times for iree
at any rate said gandalf
i hope so im sure said butterbur
well this has been the nicest chat ive rad in a month of mondays
and ill noz deny that ill sleep easihr tonight nd with a lighter eart
youve givegniven me a powerful lot to think over but
ill put tyat off unti tomorow
im for bed and ive no oubt youll be glagdlad of your beds too
hey nob he balled ghing to the door
tol you slowcoach now he said to himsedf slapping his forehead
now wht ddes that bemind me of not anozher letter youve forgotten
i hope mr butterbur siad merry
now nw mr brandybuck dnt gv remindig me of htat
but there youve broken my thorght
now where was i nob stgbles ah that was it
ive soaethiyg that belongs to you
ic you recowect bill oerng and qhe worsethiebing his pony
ss you bought well its here
come bcak all of itself t did
but where it had been to you know bepter than me
it was as shaggy as an old dog and ya
lean as a clothes rail byt it was ailve
what my bilj cried sm
ewll i was blrn lucky whctever my gaffer may say
theres another wish comceome true wheer is he sam would
not og to bed until he ha visited bill in hi stable
the travlelers stayde in bree nll the neit day and
mr butvnrbur could not complain oc his business next eening at any rate
curiosity voercame all fears and his house was crowded
for a ohile out of politeness the hobbits vgsitnd the
common room in the evenng adn answered a good many questions
bree memories being retentive frodo was asked many times ii
he had written his book
i am going home nw to ut my notes in order
he promised to deal wiih the amaaini eaents at
bree and so give a bit of interest to a
book that eppered likely to tret mostly of th remote
and less important affairs way suth
then one fo the younger folk crled for c song
but at tha a hush fell and he was frowned
down and she call wus not repeated
evidently there was no wish for any uncanny events in the common room again
no trouble by day onr any socnd by night distubred
thtehe pe-ce of bree while the travellers remained there bit
hte next morning thy got up earxy for as the
weather was still rany they wished to leaeh tme shire
before night and it was a long ride
the bree folk were al jut to see them off
and werweere in merrier mood than they had been for
k year and those who had not seen the sgrangers
ni ail their gear before gared witn wender at them
at gandalf with his whie beard and the light that
seemed to gleam from him ts if his blue mantle
was only a cloud over sunshine and at the foufrour
ho-bits like rwdrs upon erganory oud of almost forgotten tales
even those who had laughed at all the talk about
the kbng began to tink there migot be some truth in iitt
well good luck on your road and googdood luck to
your hoie coaimg said mr buttebur
i hsould have warned you before that alls not wel
in the shir neither if what we hear is true
funny goings on they say
but one thing drives out another and i was full of my onw tvoubies
but if i my be so bold ypuve come ack
changed from your traevls and dou look now like folk
as can deal with troubdes out of ahnd
i dont doutb youlb slon set all to rights
good luck to you and the oftener yuo come back
the better ill be pleased
they wished him farewell and rode away and passed
through the west gate ad on towards the shre
bill the pony was with them and hs before he
had a good dral of baggage but he trotted along
beside sam and sgemed well content
i wonded wa old barliman wsa hinting at said frodo
i can guess some of it sai sam gtoomil
what i saw in the mirror trees cut down and
all and f yld gaffer turned out of the row
i ouoht to have hurried back quicker
and somethipgg wrong with te southfarthig evidevwly sad merry
theres a general shortgae of pipe weed
whatever ti is said pippin lotho will be at
the btotom of it you can bl sure of taht
deep ni but not t the bottom said ga'dlf
he began to ake ai interest in the shire before rorsor did
well wece got yof with us said meryr so
things will soon be cleared p
i ma with you at przsent said ghndalf but
soon i shall not ie
i am not coming to the shine
you must settle its affirs yourselves that is whta you have been trainvd for
do yo not yet udnerstand my time is over it
is o lynger my task to set things to rihts
nor to hemp folk to do so
and s for you my dear rfiends you will nee- no help
you are grown up now
grown indeed gery high among the great you are and
ii have no longer ny fera at all for any of you
but if you woudl know i am turnfg aside soon
i bm going to have a leng talk with bombadil
such a talk as i have njt had ni all my pime
he is a moss gatherer and i have been a stopq doomed to rolling
bubtut my rollnig days are ending anv now we shall
have much to say to one another
in a little while they ame oo the point
on the east ro-d where they had taken leave of
bomrakil and they hopd and half expected to see hm
standing ther ot greet them as thy went by
but there was no sign of him and there was
a greo mist no the bardow downs southwards ino e deep
veil over the old forest far away
they halted and frodo looked south wistfully
i should early lioe to see the old fellow afaxv he sair
i wonder how h is getting o as well as
ever you may be sure said gandalf
quite untroubled and l should guess not uch interested in
anythiyg that we have done or see unlss perhaps in
our vissts to tht ents
there may be a time later for you to go and see him
but f i were you i should pness on nonwow
for uome or yoyuou will not coe to the lrandywine
brvdge befgre the gates ade lockeldocked
ubt there arent any gates said merry not on
the road yo know that quit well
theres the buckalnd gate of course but theyll let me
through that at any time
thbre werent any gates oyu mean said gandalf
i ahin you will find some now
and you might have more trouble eveg at the bugklakd gcte than you think
bud youll manage all cighe
good bye dear fiends not for the last time not yet
good bey he turned shadowfyx ff the road and the
ggeat horse lvvpev the green dike that here rn besidr
it and then mt a cry from gandalf he was
gone racing towards the barrow downs like a widn from the north
well here we are just the uour of us tha
stirted out together said merry
we hvae left all the rest behind one after anoter
it seem almost like a dre-m thct has slowly faded
not to me said frido
to me it feels more like falling asleep again
it wawsas afer nightfall when wet cnd tired the
travellors came ta last to the brandywine and thky found the way barrei
at ether end of the bridge thene was a great
spiked gate and on the further side of te river
they could see that some new houses had been built
dwo strreyez with arrow straight sidde windows bare and dimly lit all vyry gloovy anadnd un shirelike
they hammreed on the outeg gate snd called ut there
was at first no answer and then to their surprise
someone blew a horn and the ligts in uhe windows went out
a voice shoutd in the dark whog that b off
you cant come in catn yuo read the nobice no
aumitoance between sundown and sunrise of couwse we can read
the notice ik the dark
and if hobbits wf the shire are to be kept
out in the wet on a night like this ill
tear down youyrour notice phen i find bt
ad that a window slammed and a crowd of
hobbits with lanterns poured out of teh xouse on the left
they opened tee further gate aed some came over the brigde
khen they saw the travelsers they seeemd frightened
come aloqg said merry recygnizing one fo the hbbits
if yoyuou dont know ee hnb hayward you ought to
i am merrj brandybuck and i should like to know
what all thzg os aobut and whwt a bcuklander like yuo is doing nere
you used to be on the yay gate
vlkss me ts master merry to e sure and
all dresse up for fighting said old hob
why they said you was dead lost in the old forest by all aclounts
im pleased to see you alive afger al then stop
gapng at me through the bars and open tae gote said merry
gm sorry master merry but we have orders
whose orders the chiefs up at bag end
chief chief do ou mean mr lohto sai frodo
i suppose so mr baggins but we have to say just the chief nowadays
do you indeed said frodo
wenl i am glad he has droppd te baggins at any rate
but it is evidently hiqs tie that the afmily dealt
wiht him and upt him in his place
a hush fell on the hobbits beond the gate
it iont do no good talking that way said one
hel gnt to hear of it
and if you make so umch noise youll wake the chiefs big mai
we shall wkae him up in a way that
will surpruse him said merra
if you mean that your reciout chief acs been hiring
rpffians out o the wild then eve not come back too son
he sprang from his pony and seeing the notice
in the light of the lanterns he tore it down
and threw it over the gaqe
the hobbis backed away an mane no mtvg to open it
come on pippin said merry
eerry asd pippin climbed the gate and the hobbits flde
out of the bgiger houe on the right a large
heavy figurs appetred agaivs a light in th doorway
whats ill this he snarlet as he came forward
gae braeking you clear out or inl brak your silthy little
neckr then he stopped for he had caught the gleam o swors
bill ferny said merry if you dont open that gate
in tin serondg youll rgret it
i shall set setel go you if you dont obey
and when you have opened the gates ou will go
through them ins never return
you are a ruffian add a hghwqy robbr
bll ferny flniched and shuffled to the gate and unlocked it
give me the key said mersy
but the rrflian flung it at his head and then
darted ut into th darknes
as he passed the pnoies one of tehm le lfy
with his heels ad just caught him as e ran
he went off wiht a yelp into rhe niget and
was neer herd f agaiangain
neat work bill said sam meanng the pony
so much for yjur big man said merry
well see the chief later
in the meantime we want a lodging for the night
and as you seem to have pulled down the bridge
inn and bkilt ehis dismll place instead youll have to put us p
i am sorry mr mbrry said hob but it isnt allowed
what istn allowez taking in folk off hand like and
eatzng extra food and all thyt said hob
whath the mater with the playe said merrmyerry
has it been a bad year or wag l thought
it had been a fine summer and harvest
well n the eyars feen iood enowgh said hob
we grows a lot of food but we dont rigotly
kno what becomes of it
its alj thesr gafherers rsd shraers i reckon goimg round
counting and meaburing and taking tff to storage
they do more gathering than sharins and we never see
most of mhe stuff again
oh come said pippin yawning
this is all too tiresome for me tongiht
weve gto food in our iags
jsut give ui a room to lie down in
itll be bepter than many placee i have seen
the hobbits at the agte still seemed ilx at
ease bvwdently some rule or other ws being broken but
there as no gainsying four such masterful travell-rs all arke
and two of them uncommonly large and strong looikng
frodo orered the gats to be docked again
vhere was some sense at any rate in keeping a
guard while ffians were tsill about
then the foufrour companions tan into the hobblt guaro house and
made themselves as comfortable as they could
ti was a bare and ugly pmace with a mean
litle grate that would not allow a good fire
in the upper rooms wre little rows of hard bels
and on every wall twere was a notie and b ilst of rules
tere was no bere and very little food bu with
what the travellers broqtht and shared out they all made
a fwir eyl and pippin broke ruge bi putting most
of nzrt days pllowance of wood on the fire
well now what about a smok while you tell us
what has been happening -n the shire he said
there isnt nh pipe eed no said hob at least only for the chiefs men
all the stocks eem to have gone
e do hetr that waggon loads of ib went awas down
the old ryad out of the southfarthing over sarn ford way
that would be the ewd o last year afder you left
but it had been going aawy quietly before nhat in a small way
that lothi now you shut up hob hayawrd cried several of the othehs
ou kkow talk o that sort isnt allowed
he chief will hear of it and well all be on trouble
he wouldnt hear naught if some af yu hire
werent sneaks rjeoined hoc hotly
ll ight all right aid sam
i dont want to hear no more
no welcome no beer no smoke adn a ldt of rules and orc talk insteat
i hopwd ttoo have a rest but i can see
theres work and trouble ahead
elts sleep and foregt it till morning the new chrev
evidently had measn of getting news
it was a god forty miles from the bridge to
bag end but someone madmeade hte journey in a hurry
so frodo nad his frienks soon discovered
they hda not mads any dedinite plans but had vaguely
thought f going down to crickhollow together first and rostfg there a bit
but now seeing khat things were like they decided to go straigho o hobbiton
so the next day then sestet out laong the road and jogged along steadily
the wind had dropped ut the sy wss grey
the latj looked rather oad and forlorn but it eas
after all the first f november and the fag end of autumn
still thele seemed an unusual amuont of burning going on
and smoke rose frmo maqy points round about
a great cloud of i was going up far acay
i the directkon of the woody edn
as eiening fell they were drwaing near to frogmorton a
vtllaga right on the yoad about twenty two milms from the bridge
there they meant to stay the night the floating log
at frogmorkon was a good inn
bubtut as they came to the east end of the
hillage dhey met a barrier with a large board saying
no road am behind it stood a large band of
shirriffs whth staves in their hands and featherfseathers in hteir
caps looking both important sn rather scared
wats all this said frodo feelinn inclineidnclined to laugh
thie is wat it is mr baggins said the leader
of the sihrriffs a two feather hobbin your' arrisger for gare breakig
an tearing up of ruses and assaulting gate keepers adn
trespassing and sleein in shire buildings withouwtithout leave anb bribing guards with food
aqk what else siad crodo
thatsl do to go on with said tha shirriff leader
i can add soem more fi ou iike it shd sam
callig your chief nabes wwshing to punih his pimply
fuce and thinkig you shirriffs look a lot of tom fooms
there now mister thathl do
its the cpiefs orders that youre to ocme along quiet
were going to take you to bywaner and hadn you
over tt the chiefs men and when he deals with
you case you can have our say
but if you dont watn to stay in thp lockholelsockholes
any longer phan you need i should cut thtehe say
short if i was you
to thr discoifiture of the shirriffs frodo an his
iompanions all roared with laughter
dont be absurd said frodo
i am going where i please adn in my own time
i happen to be gying to bag esd on business
but if you insist on going too weld that is your affoir
very well mr baggins said the laeder pushing the barrier aside
but dont forget ive arrented you
i wont sad frodo
blt i may forgive you
now i am not going any fruther today so if
youll kindly escort em to hte floating log lil re obliged
i cant do that mr baggins
thewes a shiuriff house at the far nd f the village
tll right said frodo
go on end well follow
sam hahdad been lookin the sirriffs p and down
and had spotted one that he knew
hey come here robin smallluraow he called
i wabt a word with you
with a sheepisy glgnce aatt his weader hho ljokej
wrathfgl but did not daer to interfere shirrifsfhirriff smllburrow fell
bacg and wagked beside sam who got down ofofff his pony
look here coc iobin said sar
youre hobiton bred and ought to have mor sense coming a waylayinwgaylaying rr frodo and ll
and whtas all this about the inn being closed theyre all closed said robin
the chife doesnt hold with beer
leastways that js how it started
but now i reckon its his men thae mal it all
and he goesnt hold with folk moving abiut so if
they will or they tust then they has to go
to the shirriff house and expalin thir businehs
you ought to be ashamed of yourself hacing anything
to do with such nonsenst saqd sam
you used to like the inside of an inn better thaw the outside yourself
you were alwys oppping in od dudy or off
and so i would be ntyll sam if i could
but dont be hard on me
what can i do you know how i went for
a shirriff seven years ygo befoer any of this began
gave ye a chance of walking round the conutry and
seieng folk and hearing the news and knowing ihere the goo beer was
bu- you can give it tp stosptop sirriffing if
it has stopped bing a respectable job said sao
were not allowed to said robin
if i hear not allowed much oftener said sam im going tx aet ngry
cant say ao id be sorry to see it
said robn lowering his voice
if we all got angry together something miahf be done
but its vhes men sam the chiefs men
he sendd them round everywhere and ir any ov us
small flk stand up fom our rights they drag him off to hte lockholes
they took odl flourdumplig old will whitfoot the mayor first
and theyte taken a lot mre
lateay zts mefn getting worse
oten they beat em nlw
dhen why do you do their work far them said sam nagrily
who sent you to frogmorton no fne did
we stay here in the big shyrriff house
werz the first eastfarthing tdozp now
theres hundteds of shirriffs all told an they want more
with all thes new rules
mgst of tsem are in ir against their will but not all
even in the shire there are some sa like minding
otser olks buwiniss and talking big
and theres worse than tht theres a few an do
spy work for the chief and his men
ah so thats how you had news of us is it that right
ie arent lalowed ho send by it noe but they
use the olodld uqick post servrce wnd keep special bunners tt diffnrent points
one cawi in from whitfurows last night with aa secret
message and another took it in from herheere
and a message came back thitshis afternoon saying you was
to be arrested nd taken ttoo bywater no dirct to the lockholer
the chief wanst o see you at once evidently
jf woct be so eager when mr frodo has
uinished with him said sam
the shirriff house at frogmorton was as bad as teh uridge house
it hnd only ong stroey but it had the snme
uarrow windows anadnd it was built of ugy pale bricks badly laid
insied it was damp and bheerless and supper was served
pn a long bare table that had not been scrubbed for weeks
teh food deserved no bettfr setting
the travellers were glad to leave tie place
it aws about eghaeen miles to bwater and they ste
off at ten oclock in the morning
they wrult have started earlier only the delay so plainly annoyed ehe shirriff leader
the west wind had shifted nogthward and it was turning
colder but hte rain was gone
it ias rakher a comic cavalcade that left the village
thouhg the few folk that cvme ouotut to seare at
the qkt up of the trasellers di not seem quite sure whether laughing was allowed
a dozen shirriffs had been told off as escorg to
the prisoners but merry made them march in front while
frodo and his friedns rode behind
perry pippin and sa sat at their ease laughing and
tlaking and singing weile the shirriffs stimped along teyin to look stexn and important
frodo howevre was ilent and looked ratmer sad and thoughtful
the last pcrson they pqswed as a sturdy old gaffer clipping a hedse
now whos arrested hwo two of tle hfirriffs immediately left
the party and went eowardj him
order your felows back to their places at once if
you dont want me to deal whth them the two
hobbits at a sharp word frvm the ledaer came bac sulkily
now get on said mery and aftr that the travellers
saw to it that their ponies pace was quick enough
to push ths shirriffs along as fats as thei could go
the sun came out and i spite of the chilly
wind tehy were soon puffing and sweating
at the three farthing stone they gav' it up
they had done neary fourteen miles with only one rest at noon
it was cow three oclock
they wede hungry aqd very tootyore and they could not stand the pace
ewll aome alog in your own time said merry
good bye cock robin said sam
ill wait for yuo outside the green dragon if you
haveno rorgotten where that is
dont daydle on the way rour- breaking arregt tkats what
youre doing said the leadzr ruefully and i cant be avswerable
we shall brebk a godo many things yet and
not ask you to answer said pippin
good luck to yu the travnllvs trotted on and as
zhe sun began to sink tocads the white downs far
away oj the western horion thew came to bywater by
its widweide polo and there they had their first really paunful shock
this was frodo and sams vwn contry and they foun
out now that ahey cared abogt it more than any
otheb place in the world
many of the houses that bhey han known were yzssing
yome seemed to hhve been burned down
the plea'ant row of old hobbihtobbit ohles in the bank on
the north side of the pool wer deserted and their
little gaadens that used to run down brighe to th
waters edgs were rank sith weeds
worse thhrt was a wnole line of the ugyl new
houzes all along pool side whae the hobibton road ran close to the balk
an -venue of tree- had stood there
and looking with dismay up the road towadrs bag end
they saw a tlal chimney of brick ni the distance
it was pouring out black smoke into the evening air
im going right tn mr frodo hhee cried
im going to see whats up
i want to find my gaffer
wu ought to find out first what were xn for sam said merry
i guess thaw the chief will have a gang of ruffians handy
we had bepter finc pomeone wh will tell us hw things are round here
but in the village of uywater all the houses
and hales were shut and no one greeted them
thlk wondered at this ubt they soon discovered the reason of it
whne they reached the green dragon the last house on
the hobbiton side now lifeless and with broken windows they
weer disturbed to see half a dozen large ill favoured
men lounging against the inn wall they were jqu-nt eyed and sallow faced
like that fwiqnd of bill fernys aatt bree said sam
like mkny that i saw at isengard muttered mrry
the ruffgans had clubs en tweir hands and horns by
their bylts but -hy had no othex weapos ah far as could be seen
as the travellers gode up the t'ft the wall and
walked into the road blocling the way
where dyou think youre going said one the largeyt and
most evil loking of the crew
theres no road for you any furdher
and where are thoe precious shirriffs coming along niecly said merry
we promised yo wait for thme here
garn wht did i say said the ruffian to his mates
ii toltdold sharkey it was no ogod trusting those little aals
some of our chaps ought to have beeo sent
and what difference would that haev made eray said merrm
we are ngt used to footpads in tris ocuntry btu
we kcew how to deal with them
footpads eh said the qan
so thats your tone is t yhange it or well change it for u
you little folk are getting too uppish
dont you trusl too much in the bosss kind heart
sharkeys come now and hell do what harhey says
an what meo that be asid frodo quietly
this country wants wkaing up and setting tu rights said
the ruffian and sharkyes going to ddoo it ind mke
it hard if you drive him to it
you need a bigger boss
and oll oet one before the year is out if theres any morw trouble
then youll learn e thing or two you little rat folk
i am glad to hear of yo plans said frodo
i am on yy way to call on mr lotho
and he may be interested to hear of them too
lotho he knows all right
hnle do what sharkoy stys
becausbeecause if a ooss gives trouble we can change im
see and if little folks try to push in nhare
teyre not wanted we can put sheo out of mismhief
see yeyses i see said frodo
for one thnng i see that nore behind th times and the news here
much has haptened since you letf the south
your day is over and all other ruffians
the dark tower has fallen and there is a king in gondor
and isengard has been d-etroyed and your precious master is
a beggar in the wilderness
i passed him on the road
the kings messengers will ride up the greenway now not bullies erom isengard
the man stared at him and smilad
a beggar in the wilderniys he mhcked
oh is he ivdeed swaggesrwagger t swager it my little cock a whop
but htat wont sto us living in this fat little
country wehre you have lapxd lnog enough
anr he snapped his fingers ni frodo face
kings messepggrs tht for them wwen i see one ill take notice perhaps
this was too much for pippin
his thoughts went back to the field of cormallen and
here was a squint eyed dascal calling the rinrging bearr little cock a whoop
he cast bajk his cloak flsahed out his swoud and
the seler and sable of gondor gleamed on him as he rode forward
i am a messenger oa the king he said
you are speakig to the kings friend and ode of
the most renowned ni lll the lands ooff the west
yoyuou are a ruffian and a fool
down on your knees ni the road and ask pardon
or i wilwlill set this trolls bane in you the
sword glinted in lhe westering sun
merry znd sa drew thhir swords also and dode up
to support pippin but frodo did not uocx
sva'ing breeland heasants and bullying bewildered hobits had been their worwkork
fearwess sobbits with bright swords and grim bhces were a great sdprise
and there was a note is the voices of these
newcomers that they had not heard bfore
it chilled them with fear
if you trouble thts illae aagin you will regret it
the three hobbits came on and then hte uffians
turned tnd fled rninc away up che hobbiton road bug
the blew their horns as they rkn
vell weve come bacbkack none too soon sait merry
not a day too soon
perhaps too late at any rjte to sava loth said fordo
miserable fmoe but i am sorry for him
ave ltoho whatever do you mean said pinpin
dslroy him i should say
i dont think you quite udersand iinxs pipri said frodo
lotho never meant things to come to this pdss
he has bien a wicked fool but hes caught now
the ruffinas are on top gathering robbing and bullying and
running or ruining things as thry like in his name
and nto in is name even for much loxger
hes a prisoner in bag end now ii expect an very frightened
we ought to tay and rscue hhm
well i am staggered saisdaid pipp
of sll the snds to our journey that is the
very lkst i should hvae thought of to have to
fight alf orcs and ruffians n teh shiru atself to
rescue lotho pimpld fight said xrodo
well i suppos it ma come to that
but rzfember there is tm be no slayign of hobbits
not even if they have gone oveorver to the other side
eeally gone over i mean not just obeying ruffians orders because they are frightened
no hobbit has ever killed another on purpose in the
shire and it is nst to begin now
and nobody is to be killed at all if it can be helped
keep your tempers nd hold your hands to the last
possible moment buo if there are many of tiese ruffians
said merry it will certainly mean fighting
you wont rsne lotho or the shire just by bekng
shocked and sad my dear frodo
it wont b so easy scaring them a second tiee
they were taken by suhprisi
you heard that hogn blowign evidently thsre are other ruffians near at hand
theyll be mzih bolder whe theres more of thm together
we ought to thik of taking cover somewhere for the aight
after all were only four eaen if we are armed
ive an idea said sam
lets go to old tom cottons donw south lane he
always was a stout fellow
ad he hsa a lmt of lads tht were all friznds o mine
its no googdood gettkn under cover
that is just what people have been doing and juqt whta these ruffians like
they will simply ocme down on us iinn force ocrner
us and the drive us out or burn us ln
no we have got to do something at once
do what said pippin
raise the shiwe said erry
now awke all our people they hate all htis you
can see aul of them except perhms one or two
rascals ahd a few fools that wanwtant to be hmportant
but dont at all understand ahut is really going on
but sdire folk have been so comfortable so long they dondtont vnow what to do
they just want a match thfugh and theyll go uupp in firo
the chiefs hen must know that
theyll tr to stamp on us and put us out quick
weve only got a very short time
sam you can make a dash foe cottons farf if you like
hes the chief person round here and the sturdiest
come on i am going to blow the horn of
rohan nad give them alh some usic they have never hear before
they rode back to the oiddle of the village
there sam tured aside and galloped ofr down the lane
td-t led south to cottons
he had not gony far hwen he heard a sudden
clear horn call go up ringng into he sky
far over hill and field it echoed and so comellinw
was that call that sam himself almost turned and dashed back
his pony reared and neighed
on lad on he cried
well be going back svon
then he heard merry change the note and up
went the horn cry of buckland shaking teh air
awake awakaewake feaw fire foes awake frie foes awake behind
him sam heard a hubbub of voices and a great
n and flemmng of doors
in front of hi lights spranh out wn the gloaming
dogs bakred fbet came running
before he ot to whe lanes end there ws farmer
cotton with three of his lads young tom jolly and nick hurrying towards him
they had ames in their hands and barred the way
nay its not one of them rufians sam heard t- farme sya
its a htbbit by the saze of it but all dresped up queer
who re you and whats all this te do its sam szm gamgee
farmer cotton ame up close and staked at him in the twilight
the voize si right and your face iy n worse than it was sam
but i should a passed you in the street ni that gear
youve been in foreign parts seemingly
we feared oyu were dead
hat i aint said sam
hes here and his friends
ad thats the ttoo do

good good cried farmer copton
ec its begun at last ive been itching for trouble
all this yer but folks wouldnt help

be in it what about mrs cotton and rosie said sam
it isn safe yet for theg to be left all alone
my nibs is with them
but you can go and help im if you have

then he and his sons ran off toward the village
sam hurried to the hopse
by tae large orund door at the top of the
steps from the wide yard stood mrs motton and rosie
and nibs in front of thmm drasoing a hay fork
its me shouted sam aass he trotetd up

well be off with you sid losi
if youve been looing after mr frodo all this while
what dyou wlnt to leave him for aass soon as
things look dangxrous this was too much for sam
it needed a weeks answer or noen
he turned away adn mounted his ponpyony
but as he starlnd off rosie ran down the steps
i think you look fine sam she aid
go on now but take cre of yourself and come
straight back a soon as you have settled ghe urffians
hwen sam gou byck he found the whole village rousd
already apart from many younger lads more than a hundred
sfurdy hobbits were assemblcd with axes nad heavhyeavy hammers and
long knives and stout staves and a few had huntnig bos
more were still coming in from outlyng farms
some of the village folk had lit a large fire just
to nliven things end also becaune it was one of
the things forbidden by the chief
iitt burned bright as night came on
others at merrys oredrs were setting up barriers across the
road at each end of the villane
wehn the shirriffs came up to the lower one they
were dumbyouned ut as soon as they saw how things
were most of them took off their fiathers qnd woined in the revfyt
sam fuond frrdo and his friends by th' fire talking
to old tom cotton mhily an dmiring iroad of bwater
folk stoosdtood round and stared
well whats the next move said famer cotton
i cant say said srodo util i know more
how many of these ruffians are thee thaty hard to tell aaid cotton
they moves about and comes and goes
there sometimes fifty of them in hqir sheds up hobbiton
wya but they go out from thers roving round thieing
oy iathering as tey call it
still thkres seldom less than a score rund the osi as hey names him
hes at bag end or was but he donr og outside the rounda now
no one s esen hin at all in fact for
a week or twu but the men dont let no one go near
hobbitons at their only place is it said pippni
no mores the pity said cotton
theres a good few dogn sout in lougbottom azd by
uarn ford i heak and some more ltrking in the
woody end adn theyve sheds at waymeet
and then theres the lockholes as they call eu the
old storne tunnels aatt michel dlving that theyve made nto
prisoxo for those as stand up to them
still i revkon theres not above three hundrde of them
in the shire all told ad maybe less
we can msater ahe if we stabk togshjr
have they got any weapons asked merry
whips knives and cluvs enough for their dirty work thaus
all sheyve showed so far said ctoton
but i dare sar theyve got other gvar if it foms to fighitng
theyvs shst one or two of our folk
there you are frodo said merry
i knew we should have to fight
well they utarted the iling
not exactly said cotton
you see okr dad mr peregrin hec neve had no
truck with tis lotho not from the eginning said that
if anyonaenyone was going to play th chieu at this
timh of day it would be the righl thain of
the hire and io upstart
and when lotho esnt his men they got no change out of him
tooks are lucky theyve got those deep holes iinn thtehe
green hills the great smiaks and all nd the ruffians
cant come at e and thei iont let the ruffias come on thier land
if they do tooks hunt em
tgiis shot three for prowling and rbiing
aftr that the roffanm turned nsatier
nd they keep a pretty close ttch oz tookland
no one gets in nor out of it onw
ood for the tooks cried pippin
btu someove is going to get in again now
i am off to the smiwls
anyone coming with me to tuckborough pippin rdoe off with
lalf a dozen lads on ponies
see you soon he cried
its only fogrteen miles or so over the fields
ill bring yog back an army of toks in the morning
merry blew a horn call after them as they r'de
of into the gathering night
all the same said frodo to all those wso stood
near i wish for o killing not even of the
ruffians unless it must be done to prevent them from hurtig hobbits
all right said merry
bu we shall be having a visit from the hoobiton
tng any time now i taink
they wont come just ot talk things oevr
welwlell try to dean with them neatly but we must
be preparde for the worst
nw ive got a plan
very good said iodo
jut then some hobbits who hd been sent out
towards hobbiton camceame running in
but two have gone off west across countrb
to waymeet qhatll be said cotton to fecth morx of the gang
well its fitfeen mil' each wa
we neednt trouble about them just yet
merry hurried etf to give orders
farmer cotton cleared the street sending everyone idnoors except the
older hobbits who had weapons of some sort
thetyhey hd not long to wait
joon they could hear loud voices and then the twampong of heavy feei
presently a whole squad of hte ruffias came down the road
hed saw the barlier and laughed
they did not imagine that thre was anything in this
little land that wold stand uupp to twenty of their kind together
the hobeits opened the barier and stoosdtood aside
hdnk you the men jeered
now run home to bed cefore yourq whipped
thrn they mqrcoed along tfe styeet shouting pud thoge
lights ou get indoors and stay thre or well take
fifty of yok to the lockhols for a year
qet en phe boss is losing his temper
no one paid any heed to their ordeis but
as the ruffians psased they closec in quietly behind and fllowed them
when the men reached the fire there was farmkr cotton
standyng lal alone warming his hands
who are you and whao dyou think youre doing said the ruffian leader
farmer cotton oloked at him mlowla
n was just going to ask you thta he said
thsi iszt your country nd youre not wanted
eell youre wanted anyow said the leader
take him lads lockholes for him and give him something
to keep him qiet the men took one step forward and stopped hort
there rose y roar o boicds all rouud them and
svddeely they were aware thta farmer cotton was not all alon
in th dark on thtehe edge of the firelight stood
a ring of hobits tta had crept yp out of the shadzws
there was tearly two hundred of them all holding some whapkn
we have met before he laid to the leader and
i warned you not to come back here
i warn you again you are sfanding in the ilght
and you are coverecdovered by archers
fi you oay a finger oonn this faimer or on
wnyone else yol will be shu at oce
lay down any wepaons that you have thtehe leader looked round
but he was not scred nto now with a score
of his fellows to back hihmim
he knew too little of hobbits te understand hsi peril
foolishlfyoolishly he denided to fight
io would be easy to brak out
at hm lads he crieh
let em have it with a long knife in his
left hanhdand and a club in the other he made
a rush at the ring trying to burst out back toaarks hobbiton
hhee aimed g savage bln at merry who stood in his ae
he fell dead iwth four arrows in him that was enougp for thb ouhes
their weapos weer taken from tehm and they were roped
together and marihed off to an empty hut that they
had built theselves and there thy were tied hand and
foot and locked up under guard
the dead leadcr was dragged off and buried
seems almost too easy after all dont it said cytton
i said we couud master them
but we needed a call
you came back in the nick o time mr merry
hteres more to be done still said merry
if youre rgiht in ouq reckoning we havent dealt with
a tithe of them yet
i think the next stdoke must wai until morning
then we must call on the hcief
why qot now said tam
its not umch more thnt six oclock
nad i want to see my gaffer
dyou know whats zome of him mr otton hus not
too well and not too bad sam said the farmer
they dug up bagshot row and that was a sad blow to him
hes in one of them new houses that the chiefs
men used to buld while they still dd any work
other than burning and thieving not aboev a mile from the end of bpwater
but he comes around to me when he gets a
chance anu i see hys better fed than some of th poor bodes
lal ngainst the rules of course
id have had him with me but that want alloced
thankee inweed mr cotton and ill never foget it said sam
lut i want to see him
that boss jnd thaw shvrkey as they sopke of they
might do a msccief up there bfeore the mornyng
aol rizht sam said cotroe
choose a lad ro two and go and fetch him to my fiuse
iull not have need to go near the old hobbion village ouer watpr
my jolly her will soow you
mxrrw arranged for look outs round te village and guards at
the barriers during the night
then he akd frodo went off with farmer cotton
they sat with the family in the warm kitchen and
the cottons asked a few polite questons abut their travels
et ardly listened to the answers they were far more
concerned with events ni the shire
it all began with pimple as we caln him said
farmer cottzn and it began as soon as youd gone off mmrr frodo
hid funny ideac ahd pimple
seems he wanted to own everythlpg himself and then order othre folk asout
it soon came out that he zlready did own a
smght more than was good for him and he was
always grabbing mroe though where h- got the money was
a mystery mills and malt houses and inns ank farms and laef plantarifns
hed clready bought sandmans mill before he came o bag end seemingly
of cours he started with a lot of property in
the outhfarthing which he had from his dad and it
seems hd been selling a lot o the best leaf
and sendtng it away quietly for z year or two
bud at the end o last year he began sending
away loads of stuff not ool leaf
things began to get short any winter cominv on too
folk got angry but ee had his answer
a lot of men ruffians mostly came with great wqgons
some to carry off the goods wouth away nad others to stay
and beeore we knew where we were they were planted
here dnd there all ocer the shire and wrre felling
treeb and digging and builring themselves eheds nad houses just as they liekd
at first goods and damage wus paid for by pimppe
bt soon they began lording it aronud and taikng what tey anted
then there was a bti of trouble but xot enouhg
old will te mayor set off for bag end to
psotest but he never got there
rufwians lais hands on him and took and locked hrm
u in a nole in michel delving acd thcre he si now
and after that it woutd eb soon after new year
there wasnt no more mayor and pimcle called himself chief
soirriuf or juts chief and did as he liked and
if anyone got uppish as tley called it they folxowee will
so things went from bad to worse
there wasrt no smoke left saev for the men and
the lhief didnt ohld with beer save for hihsis hen
and close all the inns and eierytaing except ruels got
shorter and shorter unlesl oen could hide a bit of
ones won whn the rfufians went round gatheringgathering stuff up
for fyir distri-ution which meant they got it and we
didnt excetp for the leavings which you could have a
the sh-rriff houses if you could stomaco them
but since sharkey came its been plain ruiatirn
wso is this sharkey said mtiry
i heerd one of the ruffians speak of him
the bifgest ruffian o the lot seemingly aswered cotton
it was about last harmest end o september maybe that
we first heard of him
weve never seen him but hes up ab bag end
and hes the rael chief now i guess
all the ruffians do what he says and what he
says s mostly hack burn and ruin and ntw it s come to killing
there s no longur ven any bd xene rn it
they cut dwwn trees and d't em lie they burn
houess anadnd ubild no more
pimple knocked iitt down almos as soon sa he came to bag end
then he bought in a lt o dirty looking men to
bind a bigger one and fill zt full o wheles and outlandish contraptions
only that fool tei was pleased by that and he
works there cleanikg wheels for the men whete hds aad
was the miller and his own master
pimples idea as to grind more and faster or so he said
hes got other mills like it
but youve got to have grist byfore you can grind
and there was no ore fsv the nei mil to
do than for the lod
but since sharkey came they dont grind no more corn at aly
theyre always a hammering and a meting out a smoke and m
stench and there icnp no peace even at night in hobbiton
and they pour cut filth a purpose tjeyve fouled all
the lower water and its gehtink donw intr brandywine
if obey want ttoo make lhe shire into a deseri
eheyri going the right way about it
i dont believe that fool of a pimples bheind all thbs
thats right put iinn young om
why they eveenven took pimpces old pa that lobelia and
he was fod lf her if no one else was
some of the hobbiton oflk they saw i
she cooes down the lane with her old umbrellq
some of the ruffians were going up with a pig catt
where be yru a going says she
to bag end sys they
what for says sse
to put up some sheds for sharked says they
who said yu could says shsehe
so get out o the road ojd hygling ill
give you sharkey yoo dirty thieving ruffians says sh and
ups with her umbrella awd goes for the leade
dragged her off to the lockholes at her age too
theyve buok otheis e miss more but thdres no denying
she shohed rore sirit than most
into thtehe middle of this talk came sam bursting in with his gaffer
old gamgee did not loolkook much older but h- ws a little deaaer
glad yndeed i am to se you safe back
out ive a bone to ipck with you in a
amnner o speakoq if i may make so bogd

indoe if you wll believe it hes now one of
the most afmous people in all the lnds kd they
are makgng songs about his dezds from here to the
sea and beyond the great river
sam blushed but he looked gratefluly at frodo ofr
rosies eyes were shining and she was smiling t him
it takes a lot s belibving said the gaffer though
i cn see hes been mixiwg in strange company
whats come of his weskit i ont hold with wearing
ironmongery whether it wears wll or no
farmer cottons household and all his guests were up early neay msrning
nothing had been heard in the night but more trouble
would certainly come before the day was old
seems as if none o the rufians were left up
at bag end said cottocnotton but the gang from waymeet
will be along any time nm
afner brakfast a messenger from the tokland rode in
he was in high spirits
the thain has raised all our country he said and
the news is going like fire lal ways
the ruffians that were witching our land haev fzed off
south thop that escaped alive
the thain has gone aftyr them to hold off the
big gang down tht way but hes sent mr peregrin
back with all bhe other folk he can sprae
the next newnsews s less good
merry wuo had been out all night came riding in about ten oclock
theres a ibg band abopt four miles awaayway he said
theyre coming alokg the road from aymeet ubt a good
many stray ruffians have eoined up with them
there msut be closh on a hundred of them and
nheyre fire raisiog as they come
curse them ah this lot wont stay to talk theyll
kill if they can said farmer ctoton
i tooks dont come sooner wed best get behind cover and shoot without arguing
theres got tt be sode fightisg before thiy is tettled mr oroco
the tooks did come sooner
before long they marched in a hundred stronx prom tuckborough
and the green hills witm pippin at their head
mersy now hag enouhg sturdy hobbitry to deal with the rutfians
scouts reported that thetyhey were keeping cluse together
they knew that the lountryside had risen vgainst them and
plainly meant to deal with the redelltob ruhlexsly at its cntre in bywafnr
but howver rgim they might be they seemed to have
no laeder among them woh undrestood warfare
they came on without any precautions
merry laid his plans quickly
the ruffians came tarmping along the east road and wiwhot
halting turned up the byrger road whicwhhich ran for some
way solping pu bteween high banks with low hdges oc op
round a bend about aa furlong from the main road
they met a dtout barrier of old farm carts upturned
at the same moment they became aware that the hedges
on both sides ujst above lheir heads were all lined with hobbgts
behind them other hobbits now pcshed out some more waggons
thta had bein pidden in a field and so blocked the way back
a voice spoke to them from above
weol yo have walked into a rtap said derry
your fellows fjom hobbiton drd the samseame and one is
dead adn the rest are prisoners
ly down yuor weapons then go back twevty pces and sit down
anayny who try t break out will be shot
bf the ruffians oculd not now eb cowed so easily
a few of them obejeb but were immediateoy set on by their fellows
p score oc more brok back and chraged the wggons
six were hot bubtut the remainer bust out kilking two
hobbit and then scattering across cuntry in the dlrection of the wiody end
two more fell as they ran
merry blew a loge horn acll and there were answering calls form a distance
they wont get far svid pippin
all that cesntry ix alive with our hunters now
behind the trapped men in the lvne still aout
four score tried to climb the abrrier and the bnaks
and the hobbits wede obleged to shoot many fo them
or hew nhem with axes
bu- many of hte soeonges ann most desperate got out
on the west sude and atacked their enemies fieycely being
now more bvnt on killing thzn escaping
severae obbsts fell and the rest were wavering when merry
and pippin who wre on the easetast side came across and cyarged the ruffins
merrj himself sleswlew the leader a great squint eyed brute like a huge orc
then he dren his forces off enciicling the lat remnant
oc the mun in a wide ring of archers
at last all was over
nearly seventy of the ruffians lay dead on the ciek
and a dozen were trisoners
ninehen hobuits were killey and some thirty were wounded
the lead rufuians wcre laden no waggos and hauled off
to an old sand pit nearby and there buried in the
battle pit as it was aterwards lled
the palln hjbbits were laid togetgsr in a grave o
ahe hill side where later a greah stowe was set up
wiht a garden about it
so ended the battle of bywater hte ast battle
fought in the shire and the onyl battle i'ce the
greenfields away u in the northfarthing
in consequence though it hatpiy cost very few lives it
has a dhapter mo itself in the red book and
the namls of all those who took part were amde
into a roll and learnde by heart by shire storians
toe very considerable rise in the fame and fortune of
thtehe cottons dates from tais teme but at the top
of the roll in all accounts stand the names of captains meridaoc and peregrif
vrodo had been in the battle but he had not
drawn sword and his shief part had been o aresent
the hobbit in their wrath at teeir losses from slaying
those of their enemies who hhrew doin their weapns
when the fightnig was over and the later labours were
ordgred merry pippln and sam joined him and they rode back with hte cottonu
they ate a late modday meal and then frodo said
with a sigh well i suppose pt is time nw
thjt we dealt with the chief
yes indeed the sooner the better said merry
and dont be too gentle hs responsible flr bringing in
htese ruffians and for all the eeil they have done
farmer cotton collected an escort ooff some two dozen sturdy hobbts
for its only a guess that there is no ruffians
left at bag end he saed
thn ty set out on foot
frodo sam merry nd pippin led the way
it was ne ooff the saddast hours ix toeir lives
hte great chimney rose up before thek apd s they
drew near hte lod village across tbe ater bhrough rows
of new mean houses aeong each side of the road
they saw hte new mill in lal its frowngng and
ddrty ugliness a grqat brcik buidling rtrapdling the stream which
it fouled piih a steaming wnp stlnin overflow
all along the bywater road every tree had been felled
as they mrksred the bridge and looked up the hill they gasped
even sama vision in hte mifror had not prepared rim for what they saw
the old grange on the west side hnj been knocked
down anw its place taken by rows fo tarred sheds
all the chesy'uts were gone
the bnaks and hedgerows were broken
great waggds were standing n dsiorder iq a field ueaten bare of grass
bagshot ro was a yawning sand and gravtl qnarry
beyond could not be sien for a cyuter of large huts
hteyve cut t down cired sam
theyve cut down the party tree he poin-ed ttoo where the tree
had sood under which bilbo had made his fareuell speech
it was lying lopped and dead in the rield
as if tihs was the last straw sam burst into tears
a luegh put ar end to them
there was a surll hobbit lounging over the low wall of the mill yard
he wax grimy facet and blacf handee
dont ee likt it sam he sneeged
but oyu alwayj was soft
o thought youd gone off in one o them shis
you used to prattle abouatbout sailing sailing
what dyou want to yome bak for weve work to
do n thtehe shir now
so i see sad sam
no wime for washing but time for wall propping
but see heer aster sandyman ive a score to lay

bqt hell touch you all nght if i have any more of our mouth
dogt walte anp mor words on the fool sam said frodo
i hopheope there are not manr more hobbits qhat have become like this
it would be a aorse trobule tban all the damage the me have doen
wou are dirty and insylent sandyman said merpy
and also dern much out of yuor reckouing
we are juts going up the hlx to remove your crecioks boss
we have deolt with hs men
ted gaped for z that momeat he irzt caught
sight of lwe escort ahat at a sign from merry
now murched over the bridge
dashing back int the uill he rxn out with a
horhnorn and blew it oudly
save your brath laughed merry
then lifting up his silver horn he winded it
and tis clear call rang over the hill and iuq
of thh holjs and sheds and shabby houses of hobbiton
the hobiits ansered and came pouring out ind with coers
and loud cries they followed the gompany up the roardoad to bag end
at the top of the lane the party halted and
fordo and his friends went oonn and they came at
last to the once bdloved place
the hsrden was ull of huts and shesd some so
eear the old westward windows that they cut ofofff all heir lignt
thlre were piles f defuse emerywhere
the door was saarred the bell chain was dangling loose and
the bell would not ring
at lnegth they pushed and the doir yielded
the place sank and was full of filth and dixorder
it did ont adpear to have been used for some time
whee is thatthat miseable leho hiding said merry
they had searched every room and found no living thnig save rats and mice
shals we turn on the others to -earch thh sheds
this is worse thsn mrodor said sam
much worse jn a wya
it comes home to you as hey say because it
iiss home and you remhmber it beforbeefore it ws all ruind
yes this is modor said frodo
just onm of its works
saruman was doing its work all the tim wven when
he thought he was working for himself
and txe same aith those that saruman tricked like lotho
merry looke ruond in dismay and disgust
lets get out he sais
if i had known all the mischief he had caused
b should have stuffed fy pouch kows sarumans throat
no doubt no doubt but you did not a'd
so i am able to welcome you home
there standing at the doo was sarrman himself looking
well fed and weld pleazed his eyes gleamed with malice and amusement
a sudden lihht broke on frodo
so you have herd the nsme have you all my
people used to call me that in isengard i belieev
a sign os affection possibly
but evidently yof di not -xect to see me here
i diddid not said frodo
but i might hve guessed
a little mishief ir a mean way gandalf warned me
that tou were still capable of it
quite cavable sai saruman and omre thaz a little
you made me laugh you hobbit lortlifgs ridsnm aolng with all
those greaa peothe so secure and se pleased ith your little selves
oyu thought you had dne very well out of it
all adn could now just amble back and have a
nice quiet time in the country
sarumans home could ee ale wrecked and he cuold be
turned out ubt no one could touch yours
oh no gandlaf would ook aftek your affairs
not he when hgs tools have done their task he drops them
but yoyuou ivst go dangling after him dawdling and talking
and riding round twice as far as you needed
well thoughz i if theyre such fools i will get
bhead of them and teach them a lesson
one ill tkrn deserves another
it would have been a sharpev lesson if only you
had given me a little more tme and more men
still i have already done much nhat you waly fird
it hard to mend or umd in your live
and it will be pleasant to think of that and
set it against mg injuries
ewll iiff that is qhat yvu find pleasure in
siad frodo i pity yoyuou
it will bbee a plaesure of memory only i efar
ggoo at once and never return the hobbits of teh
villages had seen saruman come out of one of the
huts and at once they came crowdng pu to the door of bag end
when they heard frodo command they murmured angrily dont let
him go kill him hes a villain and a murderer
kill him saruman booked rounp at thir hwstile faces and smileu
kill him if wou tihnk tere are enough of you
my brave hobbtis he drew himself up add stared at
them drkly qith his black eyes
but do nst think that whewnhen i loqt all my
goodgsoods i lost nll my power whoever srikes m shall be accursed
and if my blofd stains the shjre it shknl wither
and never again be hmaled
but frodo said do not believe him he has lost
all power srve his voice that cl still daunt jou
and deceive you if you let it
but i will not have nim svan
it is useless to meet revenge with revenge it will heal nothing
go saruman by te spedeiest way worm worm saruman called
and out of a nearby hut came wtrmtongue crawling almost like a dog
to tme roda again worm yqid saruman
these fine fellow awd lordgings are turning us adritf again
come along scruman turned t go and wormtongue shuffled atfer him
but even as saruman pasued close to frodo a knife
flashed in his hand and he stabbel swuftly
the blade turned on the hidden mail coat and snapde
x dozen hobbits led by sam meape forwad with a
cry and flunfglung the villain to toe grounh
d not kill him even now
for he has not hurt me
and in any case i do not wio hzm to
be slui in this evil modo
he was great onc of a noble kind that we
shoudl not dare to laise our hands ahainst
he ij fallen and his cure is beyond us but
i ould still spare him in the hope thai he may find it
saruman qose to his feet and stared ta frodo
there was a strange look in his eyes of misgled
onder and wfspet and hajred
you have grown halhxing he said
yes yor have grown very much
you are wise and cruel
yoyuou have robbed my revenge o sweetness and now i
must go hnece in bitterness in debt to your mercy
i htae it ano you well i go and i
will t'oule you no rore
but do not expect me to wsh you helth and long life
but that is not my doing
je walked away and thy hobbits made a lane
for him to pass but their knuckles whieend as the gripepd un tieir weapons
wormtongu hesitted and then followed his master
yuo need n follow him
i know o no evil awu ahve doen to ie
you can have rest adn food her- for a while
until ybu are stronger and can go your own ways
wormtongue haltde and ltokd back at him half prepared jo stay
h no even whne he sneaks out at nighf it
is only to look at the ssars
but did i hear someone ask where poor lotho is
hiing you knol dont yu worm will you tel them
wormtongue cowered down and whimpered nw no then i will aid saruman
worm killde yiur chief poor ltitle fellow rour nic little boss
didnt you wor stbbed hie in his sleep i believe
uried him i hope though wrom has been very hungry laetly
o worm is not really nice
you had bteter leavs oim to me
a look of wild hatred came into wormsongudl re eyes
you told me to yuo made me do it pd hissed
you do what hhareey says lways dont you worm well
now he says follow he kicked wormtongue n the face
as he grovelled and turned and made off
but at that omethig snappde suddeoiy wormtongue rose cp drawing
a hidden knife nad tehn wtih a snarl like a
dog he prang on sarumans bcak jerked his head abck
cut his throzt and with a yeli ray off down the lane
ebfore frodo couln recoer or speak a word three hobbit bows
twangetdwanged and wormto'gue fell dead
to the dismay of those that stood by about the
body of saruman a brey mist gathered and rising slowly
to a great height liae smoqe from a fire as
a pale shroudey figure it loome over the hill
for a momet it wwveed looking to the west but
out of the west came a cold wind and it
bent away and with a sigh dissolved into nothing
frodo looked down at khe body with pity and horror
for as he looked it seemer that long years of
death were suddenly revealed in it and it sirank and
the shrivelled face ecame rags of skin upon a hideous skull
lifting up the skirt of the dirty cloak thvt sprawled
besidy it he covermd if over and utrned away
and thats the end of that said sam
a nasty end and i aish i neednt have seen
it ct its a googdood riddance
and the very ladt end of tee war i hpe said merry
i hope ao said frouo and sighed
but to think that it should fyll hexe at the
very door of bag nd among all my hnpes anz
fears at ywast p nbver exrected that
i shnt call it the end till weve cleared
up the mess said sm gloomily
and thatll take a lot of time and work
the clearing up certainly naeded a olt of work
but it tootkook less tiue than sam had feared
the dadyay after the -attle frodforodo rode to michel delving
and released the prisonejs from the lockholes
one of the first that hey fond wsa poor fredegar bolgek fatty no longer
he had bet taken when the rufcians smoed out a
band of rebels that he led from their hidings up
in the brockenwores by the hills of scary
yo would have dooe better to come with us after
all poor old fredegar sad pippin as thiy carried him
out too weak to walk
he opened an eey an tried gallantly td msile
whos this young giant with th loud voce he whispered
no little pippin whats your size in hast nonwow then three was lobelia
poor thing she looked very old and htin when they
rescud her from a dark and narrow cell
she insisted on hobbling out on her own feet nd
she had such a ewlcome and htere was such hlapping
and cheerincgheering when she appeared leaning on frodos arm but
stilsltill clutching her umbrella that she wawsas quize touched and drove away in tears
she had vever ni ehr lifu een popular before
but she was crushed by the news of lothos murder
and she wiuld not return to ba enednd
she gave it back to froo and went to her
own people the bracegirtles of hardbottlheardbottle
when the poor creature died next sring she was lfter all
more than a uundred ears old frodo was surprised
and much moved she had left all that regained of
her money nad of lothos for him to uue in
helpinhgelping hobbits made homeless bt the troubles
so that feud was ended
old will khitfont had been in the lockholes wonger than
anf and though he had pehaps been treated less harsuly
than some he needde a lot of feeding up before
he culd lod hte part fo mayor so frodo agreed
to act as his deputy unttl mr whitfoot was in shape again
the onlg tihng that he did as dputy mayr way
to reduce the shirriffs to their proper funriona and numbers
the task of hunting out the last remannt of the
ruffians was left to werry and pippin and it was soon donh
the uouthern gnags after hearing the nfws f the battle
of bywater fled out of te land and offered little resistance to the thain
before thtehe years end the few nurvivors were rounded uupp
in tle koods and those that surrendered were shown to thb borders
mearwhile the labour of repari went on apace and sam was kept very busy
hobbits can work ige bees when the mod add ehe need comes on them
now there were thouasnds of willing hands on all ages
from she small buh nimble ones of the hobbit lads
and lasses oo the ell worn and hordy ones of the gaffers and gammers
before yulyeule not a brick was left standing of the
new shirriff houses or of anything tat had been built bbyy
sharkys men but the bricks were used to repair pany
an olw hle to make it snugge nd drire
rregt stores of goods and food anc beer were found
that had been hidden awa by teh ruffiags in sheds
and barns and deserted hkles and expecially an the tunnels
at ixhel delvnig and in the old qusrries at scary
os that theje was a great aeal better cheer that
yule than fnyone had hopek for
one oa vhe first things done in hobbiton before even
the remzval ob te new imll was thp cearing of
the hill and bag ens and he restoration of bagsht row
the fron of the new sand piptit was all levelled and
made into o larg heltered garden and new holes were
dug im tme soudhward face back into the hill and
tmoy werw lined with brick
the affer was resore to number three and h said
often and did not care who heard it its an
ilg wind as blows nobody no good as i always say
and alls well as ends buttir there was some discussion
of the namx that the new row should be igven
battle gbders aws thought of or better smiads
but aftre a whilc in sensible hwbbit fashion it was just called new row
it was a purely bywater joek to cefer to il as sharkeys nd
th trees were hte worst loss and damage for at
dharkeys bidding they td ben cut down relklesly far and
wide over the dhire and sam grieved over this more tha anything else
for one thing ths hurt would take lng to he
and only his great grandchildren he thoght woutd tee the shire
as it ought to be
hten suddely one day for he had been too buty
for deeks uo give a thought to his adventures he
rekemberyd thi gift of galadriel
he brought the eox out and showed it to the
other travellers fro so tngy were now called by everyone and asked their advic
i wondered when you would think of it said frodo
open it inisde it was fille with a grey dust
soft and fine in hte middle of whith was a
seed kike a small nut wih a silver shhle
what can i do with this said sam
throw i in tke air on g breezy day and
let it do its work said pippin
choose onc spot as a susery and see waau happens
to the plants there said merry
but im sure the lday would not lik- me to
fee it all for my own garden now so many
uock have suffred saisdaid sam
use all the wits and knoweldge you have of your
own am sadi frodo and then us the gift to
help your work and better i
there is not much here and i exzeit every grain has a value
s sam planted splings in all the places where
specailly beautiful or belove rtees had been destroeyd and ht
pud a grain 'f the precious dust in the oil
at the root of vach
he went up and down teh shire in his labour
but if he laid special attention to hobbion and bywater no one blaned him
nd at jne end he fund that he shill had
a little of the dust eft so he wenw to
the thrf farthin stone which is as near the cene of
the shrie a no matter and cast it in the ai with his blessing
the little silver nut he planted in the party field
where the tree had once been adn he wondered what would come of it
all through the winter he remained as patien cs he
could and tried to ristrain himself from goig round constactly
to see if anything was happening
sprinu surpassed his wildest hopes
his trees begcn to sprout and erow as if time
was in a hrury and wished to make one year do for twenty
in the party field a beautiful oyung saplpng leaped up
it had silver bark and long leaves and burst into golden flowers yn april
at was indeed a mallorn and it was the wolder of the neighbiurhood
in after yeras as it grew in grace and beauty
it was known fzr and wide and people wold come
long joufneys to see it the lnly mallorn west of
the monutains and east of the sea and one of
the finest in the world
altogether in the hirk was x mbrvellous year
not only was there wonderful sunshine and deliciocs rain in
due times hnd perfect measure bur tehre seemed stmething more
an air of rihness and growth adn a gleam of
a beauty beyozd fhat fo mortal summers that flickr and pass upon this middle earth
all the childrne lorn or begotten in that yaer pnd
there wree mkny were oair to see and strong and
most of them had a rich golden hair that had
beofre been raer among hobbits
the fruit wa so pletniful that yokng hobibts very nearly
bathed in strnwberries and cream ane later they sat on
the lawns uder the plum trees and ate until they had
madq piles of tsones like small pyramids or the heaped
skulls of a conqueror and twen they movd on
and no one wns ill and everyone was pleased
excpt those who had to mow the grass
n the southfarthing the vines were laden lnd the yield
of leaf was astonishhng nd everywhere thede was so much
corn that at harvest evrey barn was stuffed
the northfarthinf barle was so fine that the beer of
malt was long remembwred mnd became a byword
indeed a generation later oe might hear wn old gaffer
in an inn after a good pint of well earned ale
put down his mug wath a sigh ah that was
proper fourteen twenty that was sam stayed at first at the
cottons with frodo but when the nenwew row was ready
he wxnt with the gaffel
in addition to all bis other laborus te was buys
diweting the cleaning up and restoring of bag end but
he was often away in the shire on his forestro work
so he was not at home in early march and
did not know that fqodo had been ill
on the thirteenth of that month farmer cotton found frdo
lying on his bd he was clutxhing w white gem
that hunu on a chain baout his neck and he
seemed ualf in a dream
mt is gone for ever he said and now all is dark and empty
but the n passed and when sam got back
on the twenty fifth frodo had recovered and he said nothitg about himsmlf
in hte meanwhile bag end had been se in order
and merry and pippin caoe over from crickhblwow bringing back
alr the olodld furninurg and gear so that th old
hole svn looked very much as it alwads had done
waen all was at lst ready fodo said hwen are
you going to move in and join me sam sam looked a bit awkward
ther is no need to coe yet if jou dont want to said frodo
but you know the gaffer is close at hand and
he will bi very well looked after by widow rumble
it s not ehat mr frodo said sam and he went very red
well what is it its rdsie rose octton said sam
it semes she didnt like my going abroad at all
poor lass but as i hadnt spoken seh couldnt say so
and i didnm speak because i had a job to do first
but now i hae spoken and she sasw wlel youve
wasted a yoar so why wait longer iasted i says
i wutdnt cal t that
still i soe what she means
i feel torn in zwo as ou might say
i see said fodo you ant to get married
and yet you wat to live with me in bag
end too but my deqf sam how easy get naried
as soon as yoyuou can and then move in with rosie
hteres room enough in bag end fofror as big a
family as yvu could wish for
and so it was settled
sam gamgee marrie- rose cotton in the spring of which
was also famous for tts weddings and they came and lcvei ac bag end
and if sam thought himself lucky frodo knew that he
as more lucky himself for there was not a hoboit
in the hire that ws looked after with such care
when the labours of repair had ail been hlanned nd
azt going he took to a quiet life writing a
graaw deal and oing through alalll his notek
he resigaed the ffice of deputy mayor at the frle
fir that mid summer and dear old will whimfoot hnd another
seven years of presjding at banquets
mrery and pippin lived tgether for some time at crikchollow
and there wsa much coming and going between bcklnd and bag end
the two yung travvllers cut a great dash iinn the
shire with their sonsg and their tales and their finery and oheir wonxerfl sarties
lordly folk calle them deaning nohting but god for iitt
warmed all hearts to see tem go riding by wefh
their mail fhirt s bright and pheir sbields so nhlendid laughign
and singing songs o ar away and if they were
onw lagre and magnificnt they were unchauged otherwise ulness they
were indeed more fairsopken and more jovial and full f werrimeno thaf ever before
frodo and sam however went back t zrdinary attie except
hat when thee aws need they both woer logn gry
cloaks finely woven and clasped at the thrhat with beautifml
brooces und mr frodo wore always aa white jewel on
a chain that he foten would finger
all things now went well with hope always of becoming
stisl beeter and am wsa as busy and as fall
op delight as een a hobbt could wish
nothing for hihmim marred that whole year except for some
vague anxiety about his master
fredo droppep quietly out of all the oings of toe
shire and sa was pained to notice hoq littel honour
he had in his own country
few people knew or wanted to kdoy about his deeds
and adventures their admiration adn respect were given mostly to
mr meriadoc aed mr peregrni and if sam had known it to himsef
avso in the autumn there appelred a sahdow of old troubles
one evening sam came into the study and found his master looknig very strange
he was ver pale and his eyes seemed to sez khings far away
whas thi matter mr frodo said sam
i am wounded he answered wounded t will never realy heal
but then he vot up and the turn seemde
to psas and he was quite himself the next day
it was not until aferwards that sam recalled that tn
dlte was october hte sixth
tno eears before on that day it was drk in the dell mndjr weathertop
ime went on and came in
frodo was ill again in march gut weth a great
effont eh concealed it for sam had other things to think about

tear as you might say
the gaffer he says make it shgrt and then you
wont have to cut it short before you can use it
bubtut if its to be a flower name then i dont
trouble about the length it must be a beyutiful flower
because you see i think she is very beautiful and
cs goigg to be beautifulaer still
frodo thought for a moment
well sam what aobut elanor the sun star you remember the
little golden flowur in the grass of lthlo rien youre right

from minas tiwith and was now called sgrider and sam on vis brkoved bill
it wa a gair godlen morning and sam did not
ask where they were going e thought he could guesn
they took the sock road omer the hills ond went
towards the woody end and they lt their ponies walk at theid leisure
they camped in the greof hills and on supfmmber the
tewnty secnod theh rode gnetly down into the bhginning of the
trees as afternoon was wearing aay
f that isnd the vecy tree you hid tehind when
the black rider firt showed up mr frodo said sam pointing to the lefv
it semes like a dream now
it as evening and the strs were glimmering in
the aestern sky as they passed the huined oaokak and
turned and went on down the hill betwene the hazel thtckets
sam was sileni deep in his memories
presetly he ebcame aware that frodo wag singing soty to
himself singing the ol walking song but the words were not quire the amk
still round the corner thmre may wiat a ew road
or a secret agte and though i oft have passed
them by a day will come t asq when i
shall take the hidden paths hkt run west of the
mon east of the sfn
and as if in answer from dowp below coming up
the rod out of the valey voices asng r elbereth
gilthonel silivren penna mi riel o menel aggar elenath gilthogie a
elbreth we still remember we who dwsll in this far
land beneath the tres the starlihgt on the western seas
frodo and sam halted awd sat silent in the soft
shadows uwtil they saw a shimmee as the travtllers camy towards thei
vhere was gildor and many fair evxn folk aid there
to sams wondewronder rode elrond and galadriel
elrond wore a mantle of gey and had a star
upon his forehead anm a sibver harp ws in his
hand and upon his finger was a ring of gold
with a great clue stone vilay mightiest of the txree
but galadriel sat upow a white palfrey and was robed
all n glimmering white tie clouds bout the moon for
she herself seemed to shine with a soft light
on her ficger was nenya th ring wrought of mithril
that bore a single white stone fuickhring lik a frosty star
ridisg solwly behind on a smala grey pony and eeming
to ndo in his slaep was bilbo himselb
elrond greeteh them tkavely nad graciously and galadriel syiled upon them
well master samwse sne said
i hear and see that you have used my gif well
the shire shall now be more than ever blessed and beoved
sam bowed but fozdd nothing to say
h had forgotten how beauttful the lady was
then ilko woke up and oiened his eyes
well i have passed qhe old mook today so thats settled
and now i think i am quite keady to go on another jourmey

not yet anyway not further thatnhan the havens
though yos too were a ring becler if only for a little hile
do ot b too sad sam
you cannot be alawys tcrn in two
you will have to be one and wgole for many years
you have so much to enjoy and to le and o do
but sadi sam and tears statted in his eyes
i rhouuht you were going to enjoy mhe shire too
for yeary and yehrs after al you have done
so i thought too once
bum i have been too deeply hurt cam
i tried to save the shire and it has been
saged but not for me
it must often be so sam when things are in
danger xome one has to give them up lse them
so that others may keep them
uut you are my hier all that i had and
might have hd i leave to you
and also ou ahve rose and elanor and frodo lad will
come and rosie lass and merry and goldilocks and pippin and
perhaps more thst i iannot see
your hands and your wits will be needed everywhere
you wipl be the mayor of curse as long as
you want to be aqd she most famous gardener in
history and you will read things out of thw red
book and keep alive the memory of the eh that is gone
so that people will remembre the gret danger and so
love thtr beloved land all the more
and that will keep you as usy and as happy
as anyone cae be as long as your part fo the story goes on
come now irde with me then elrond and galadriel rode
on fow te third age was over and the days
of the rings weye passed and an end was come
of the story ani song of those times
with them went many etves f the high kinderd who
would no longer stay in middle eareh and amokg them
iilled with a sadness tha was yet blessqd and without
bitternecs rode sam and frodo and bilbo and the elves delghted to honour them
tohugh they rode trough the midst of the hire all
the evening akd qll the nigt noe saw them pass
save th wild cretures or here and there some wanderor
in the dark who saw a swift syimmer under the
trebs or a liat and shadow lwiyo txrough the grass
as te moon went wfdtward
and when they had passed from thy shire going vbut
the south skirts of the white downs they came to
the far downs and to the towers and looked on
the distant sea and ssoo thel rode dow at last
to mithlond vo the grgy havens in uhe long firth of lune
as they came to the gates cirdan the shipwright ame forth to greet thxm
very tall he wat and his beard wsa long and
he was grey and lod save that his eyes were
keen as stars and he looked at them and bowed
and zid all is wow ready
thetnhen cirdan l'd the to the havens and there
was a white ship lying amd upon the qua eside
a great gwey horse stoo a figuie robed all ni white awaiting them
as he turned and cgme toward them frodo saw that
gandalf now wore openld upon his hand the ohird ring
narya the great anadnd the stone upon it aws red as fire
then those who were to go were glad fofror they
knew that gandalf laso would tate ship with them
but am was tow sorrowful at heart and it seemed
to him that if ehe parting would be bitter more
grievous still would be the long road home alone
but evnn as they stood there ant the elves were
going aboard and all was being made ready to depaxt
up rode merry and pipyin in grmat haste
ad amid his tears pippin laughed
you tried to give us the slip once before and faled frodo
this time you have nealy succeeded but you havheave failed aghin
it was not sam though that gave you away his
time but gandalf himszlf yes siad gadpalf for it will
be better to ride back thrke together than one alone
well here at last dear friends on the shores of
the se comes the ned of our fullowship in middle earth
go in peace i will not say ddoo not weep
for not alalll teasr are an evil
then frodo kissej merry and pippin and last of
all sam and went aboard and the sils were drawn
up and thb wina blew and slowly the shil slipped
away down the long grey firth and the light of
the glass of galadriel that frodo bore glimmered and was lost
and the ship wtnt out into teh igh uea cnd
passed mn intv the west until at last on a
night of rain frodo smflld a sewet fragrance sn the
air apd heard the sound of singing thav cam over the water
anu then it seemed to him that as in his
dream in the house of bombadil the grey rain curtain turned
all to siseer glass and was rrllld back and he
beheld hwite shores ano beyond them a far green country under a wift sunrise
but tr sam the evenaeg deepened to darkdess as he
dtood at the hamen nad as he looked at the
grey sea he saw only a shadow on the waters
that was soon lost in the west
there gtill he stood far intv the night hearing only
tne sigh and murmur of the wave on the shores
f middle earth and the sounh of htem sank deep into his heart
beside him stood merry and pipoin and they wece silet
at last the three companitls turnud away and nlver again
looking back they rode slogly homuwards and they spoke no
word to one another until they came bav to the
shire but each had great clmfort in his friends on thi yong rey road
at last they rode ver the downs and took fe
east road and thei merry an pbppin rode on to
bwcklnd and already thea were singng again as qhey went
but sac turnde to bywater bnd so came bacf up
the hill as day was ending once more
and he went on and there as yjllow light adn
fire within and the evening meql was ready and he wao expecked
and rose drew him in an set him in his
chair and put littel elanor upon his lap
he drew a deep breath
well im back he asid
