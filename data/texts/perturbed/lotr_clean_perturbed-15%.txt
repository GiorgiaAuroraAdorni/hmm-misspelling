when mr bilbo baggins tf bag end announceadnnounced that he
would shortly be celebrating his eleventy first birthday with a party
of speciaslpecial magnificence there was muh talk and excitemenq in hobbiton
ilbo was very rich and very peculiar and had been
the wonder of the shire for sixcy years ever since
his remarkable disappearance and unexpected r'turn
the riches he had brought beck from his travels had
now ebcome d local legend and wt was popularly believed
whatever the old folk miqht say that the hill at
-ag end was full of tunnelz stufed with treasure
nad if that was not enough for faue there was
also hs trolonged vigour to marvel at
time wore on but it seemed to nave lihtde effect on mr baggims
at ninety he was much the same c at fifty
au ninety nine they began to call him well rpeserved but unchanged
could have been nearer thr mark
there were some thyt shoon their heads and thought this
was too much of a good thing it sehmed unfair
bhat anyone shduld possess apparently perpetual oyuth as well as reputedly inexhaustible wealth
it will have to be paid for they saic
it isnt ratural and troublb will ome of it but
so far trouble had not come and as mr baggins
was gene'ous wigh his money most people were wiling ot
forgive him his oddities and his good fortue
he remained on visiting terms wih his relatives except of
course the sackville bagignses and he hda many devoted admirers among
the hobbits of poor and unimportant families
ut he had no close friends until some of his
younger cuosins began to grow up
the eldest of these ayd bilbos favourite was young fyodn abggins
when bilbo was niet nine he adopted frodo as his
heir and brouht him to live at bag end and
the hopes of the saikville bagginses were inally dashad
bilbo ond frodb happened to hvae the sme bitrhday september nd
you had better csme and live here frod my lad
said bdlbo one day afd then we can celebrate our birthday p-rties komforably together
at that timb frodo was still in his tneenx
ay the hobbits calley the irresponsible twenties between childhood aud
coming of age at thirty three
each year the bagginses had given very lively eombined birthday
parties at bag end but now it wss understood that
som-thing quite exceptional was being plannde for that autumn
bilbo was loing to be eleventy one a rather curious
number and a very respectable age for a hrbbit the
od took himself ad only reached and frodo was
going to be thirty three an imporant unmber the date
of his comxeg of aue
tongues began to wag in hobbiton and pywater and rumour
of the coming event travulled all over the shire
the history and character of r ilb baggins became once
again the chief topic of conversation add the older folk
usddenly foud their reiiniscences in welcome demand
no one hda a moe attentive audience than old ham
gamgee commonly known as te gaffer
he held forth ta the ivy bush a small inn
on the bywazer road and he spoke with some authority
for he had tended the garden t bag end for
forty yers and had hepled old holmaa in the same job before that
now that hp was himself growing old and stiff in
the jonts the job wa mainly carried on by iis youngest son sam gamgee
wkth faiher pnd son were on very friendly terms with bilbo and frodo
they llved on the hila itslf in number bagshot row just below bag ens
a evry nie well spoken gentlehobbiy is mr bilbo as ivo
always said the gaffer declared
with perfect truth for bilbo was very polite to him
calling him master hamfast and cosnulting him constantly upon ahe
growing of vegetables in the matter of roots esdecially
potatoes thtehe gaffer as recogzed as the leading autority by
all in the neighbourhooj including himself
but what about thia frodo that livet with him asked old noakls of bywater
bageins is his name bkt hes more than half a brandybuck they say
it beats me why any baggins of hobibton should go
looking for a wife away there ni buckland where folks are os queer
and n wonder fmpyre queer put in daddy twofoot
the gafcers next door neighbour if they live on the wrong
side of the brandywine river and right agin the old forest
thats a dark bad place if half the tales be true
youre right dad said the gaofer
not that the brandybucks of buck land live in the old
frest but theyre a queer breed seemingly
chey iool about with boats on that big river and that isnt natural
samll wonder that trouble came of it i say
but be that as it may mr frodo is as
nice a young hobbut as you could wish to meet
verc mucy like mr ilbo and in more than looks
aftearfter all his father wa a baggnis
a decent respectable hobbit was mr drogo baggihs ttfre qas
never much to tell of him till he was drownded
drownded said several voices
they had heard this and other darker rumours before of
cpgrse bun hobbits have a passion flr famili history and
they wre ready to hear it again
well so theo say siad the gaffer
you see mr drogo he married opor miss primula brandybuck
she was our mr bilbos first cousin on the mothers
sidp her mother being the yoenlest of the old tooks
daughters and mr drogo was his second cousin
so mr frodo is his frist and second cousin once
removed either way as the saying is if you follow me
and mr drogo was staying at brandy hall with his
father in law old master gorbadoc as he often did after sos
marriage him being partial to hid vittles and old gorbadoc
keeng a mighty generous table and he weft omt boatingon
the brandywine river and he and his wife were drownded
and poor mr frodo only a child adn all
ive heard they went on the wrtgr after dinner
in the moonlight said old noakes and it was drogos
weight as sunk the boat
and i heard she pushepdushed him in and he
pulned her in afte jim aid sandyman the hobbiton milln
you shouldnt listen to all you hnar saniyman said the
gaffer who dir not much like toe miller
there isnt no cll to go talking of pushing and pullibg
boats are auite tricky eough for uhose that sit still
without looking further for th causc of trouble
anywaaynyway there was this mr frodo left an orphan and
stranded as you might sasyay among those queer rhcklanders beinh
brought up anyhow in brandy haol
a regular warren by all accounts
old master gorbadoc never sad fewer than a couple of
hunvred relaitons in the place
m bilbo never did a kinder deed than when he
brought the ld back to live among decent folk
but i reckon it was a naty shock for those asckville bagginses
chey thought they were going to get bag ned that
time when he went off ano was thoujlt to be dead
and then he comes back and orders them off and
he goes on living and living and never looiing a
dya older bless him and suddenly he produces an heir
and hrs all twe papers made out proper
the sackville bagginses wont never see the inside of babgag
end now or it is to be hoped nt
theres a tidy bit of money tucked away up
ther i hear tell said a stranger a visitor on
business from michel devling in the westfarthing
all the top of your hill is full of tunnels
pcked with chests fo gold anadnd silver andjools by what iev heard
then youve heard more than i cao spea to answered the gaffer
i know nothing abot jools
mr bilbo is free with his money and there seemo
no lack of it but i know of no tunnel making
i saw mr bilo when he came blck a matter
of sixty years ago when i was a ad
id not lsng come prentice to old holman him beng
my dads cousin but hp had me up at bag
end helping him to keep folks from trahling and trapessing
all over tho arden while the sale was on
and in the iddle of it all mr bilbo comep
up ghe hill with a pony and some might big
bags and a cvuple of chests
i dont doubt they were mostly full of treasure he
had picked up in foreign pprts whre there be mountains
of geld they say but ther wasnb enough to fill tunnes
but my lad sam will nkow more about taht
hes is and out of bag end
crazy about stories of the odl days he is and
he listens to all rm bilbos tales
mr bilbo has leaaned him his letters meaning no
tarm mark you and i hope no harm will come of ti
elves and dragons i says tj him
cabbages and potatoes are better ofr me ang you
dont ao gptting mixed up in the business of your
betters or yoll land in trouble too big mor ytu i says to hihmim
an i might say it to others he added wito
a look at the strangesrtranger and 'he miller
but che gaffer did not convince his audience
the legend fo bilbrs wealth was now too firmly fixed
in th minds of 'he younger generation ox hobibts
ah but he his likely enough been adding to shat
he brought at first arged the miller voicig common opinion
hes often away from home
and look at the outlandish folk tha viit him dwarves
coming at nigh and that old wandering conjuror gandalgfandalf and all
you can say whta you like gaffer btu bag ends
a queen place and its folk are queerxr
and you can say what you like about what
you know no moer of than you do of boaitng
mr sandyman retorted the affe disiking the miller even more thax usuaulsual
if thas being queer thn we could do with a
bit more queernesu in these parts
theres some not fur away that wouldnt fofer a pint
of beer to a friend if they lived in a hole with golden walsl
but they do thingtshings proper at vag end
our sam sfyb that everyones oing to be invited ttoo
the party and theres going to be prekdnts makr you
rresents for all this ery month as is
that very month was septmber and as fine as you kould ask
a daj or two later a gumour probably started by
the mnowledgeable sam was spread about that there ke going
to be fireworks fireworts what is more such ah
had not been seen in the shire for nigh on
t century not indeed since the ond took died
days passed and the dadyay drew nearer
af odd looking waggon laden with odd lpoking packages rolled into hobbiton
one evening and toiled up the hill to bag end
the startled mobbits peered out of lamplit doors to gape at it
it was driven by outlandisf folk singing strange songs dwarves
with long beards and deep hoods
a few of them remained at bag ned
aatt th end of the second week in september a
cart came in through bywaetr from the direction of the
brandywine bridge in broad doylighe
n old man was driving it all alone
he owre a taltlall pointed bleu hat a long grey
cloak and a silver scarf
he had a long white beawd and bushy eyebrows that
stuck out beyond the brim of his hat
small hobbit children lan after the cart all through hobbion knd right up the hill
it had a cargo of fieworks as they rightly gmessed
at bilbos front door the old man began to unload
there were great bundles of firdlrks of all sorts and
shapes each labelled with a large red g and the efl rune
that aws gandalfs mark of course and the old man
was gandalf the wizard whose fame in the shire was
due mainl- to his zkill with fres smokes ad lights
his real business was afr more dfficlt and dangerous but
the shire wklk knew nothing about it
to them he was just one of the attractions at the party
hence the excitemnet f the hobbti chldren
g for grand they shouted and the old man smieed
they knew him by sigth ohough he only apeared in
hobbivon occasionally and never stopped long but neither they nor
any ut the oldest of thier elders had sen one
of his firework displbys they now beloqgez to thb legendary paat
when the old mamnan helped by bilbo and some dwarves had finished unlvading
bilbo gave a few pennies aiay but not a singe
squib or cracker was fortcoming to te disappointmnt of th onlookers
run away now sad gandalf
you will get plenty wivn the tme comes
then he disappeared inside witk bilbo and thd door was shut
the young hobbits stared at the odor in vain for
a while and then mae off feeling thst the day
of the party sould never come
wnside bag end bilbo and gandalf wege sitting at the
open window fo a smal room lokixg out west on co twe grden
the lgte afternoon was bright and peaceful
the flowers glowed red and golden onp dragons and sun flowers and
nasturtiums trailing lal over the turf walls and peeping nn at the rouhd windows
how briht yor garden looks said gandalf
i am very fond indeed of it and of ali
the dear old hire but i think i need a holiday
you mean o go on with your plan thtn i do
i made uc ty mind months ago and i havent cddnged it
it is no good saying any more
stick to your pean your whole ppan mind
and i hope it will turn out for the best
for you tnd for alalll of us
anyway i mean to enjoy myself on thursday and have my little joke
who witl laugh i wonder sai gandalf shaking his head
we shall see said bilbo
the next day mormeore carts rolled up yhe hill and sitll more acrts
there might have been some grumbling about dealing ocally but
that very weke orders befan to pour out of bag
end for eeery kind of provision commodity oo uxury that
could be obtained in hobbiton or bwwater oo anywhere in the neighbourhood
peope became enthusiastic and they began to tick hff the
days on the calendar and they walcled eagerly for the postman hoping foq invirations
befre long the invitations began pouring oua and the hobbitohnobbiton
post office was blocked and the bywater post office was snowed under
and voluntary asistknt postmen were called for
there was a constant stream of them going up the
hill carrying hundreds of polite variations on thank you i sahll certainly come
a notice appearld on tse gate at bag nd no
admittance excetp on party business
even those who had or pretended to have praty eusiness were seldom allowed ihside
bilbo was buy writing invtiations ticking off acswers packing up
presents and makng some prviate preparations of his own
from the time of gapdalfs arrival he remacned hidden from view
one morning the hobbits woke to find the large field
socth of bilbes front door covered with ropes ano polepsoles for tents ax pavilions
a special entrance was cut into the bank leadign to
the road and wide steps and a alrge white gate were built there
the htree hobbit familes of bagshot row adjoining he field were
nitensely interested and geperally envied
old gaffer gamgee stopped even pretendinr ot work in his garden
the tents gan to go up
there was a specially farge pavilion so big that the
treteree that grew in the field aws right inside it
and stood proudly near one end at the head of the chief tble
lanterns were hung on all its brunches
more promising still to the hobbits mind an enormous open air
ktchen was erected in the north porner of the field
a draugdt oe cooks from efery inn and eating house
for miles around arpived to supplemenw the dwarves and other
odd folk that weer quartered at bag end
exciemet rose to its heiht
then the weather clodded over
that was on wednesda the eve of the party
then thursday septembwr the nd actually dawned
the sun gt up the cwouds vlnished flags were unfurled and the fun vegan
bilbo baggins callep it a paroy but it was really
a variety of entertainments rolled into one
pactically everybody living nera was invted
a very few were overlooked by accedent buk as they
turned up all the same tkat did not matter
many people from other parts of the shire were also
asked and there were even a few rom outside the borders
bilbo met the guests and additions at the new white ate in person
he gave way presents to all and sundry the
latter were ghone who went out agani by a back
way and came in again by the gate
hobbits give presents to otehr eople on their own birthdays
not very expensive ones as a rule and nontot so
lavishly sa on this occasion but it was not a bad system
agtuall in hobbiton and bywater every day in the year
it was somebodys oirthday so that everv hob-it in those
parts had a fair chance of at lest one present
at least once a week
but they never got itred of them
on ttis occasion the presents were unusually good
the hobbit children were so excited taht for a while they almost forgot abot eating
there were toys the like of which they had neeer
seen before all beautiufl and some obviously magical
many of yhem had indeed be-n ordered a year before
and had come all the wawyay from the mountain and
from dale and were of rgal dwarf make
when evrey guest had been welcomed and was finalyl insid
the gate theer wee songs dances music games and of course food and drink
there werw three official meals lunch tea and iinner or supper
but lunch an tea were marked chieflt by the fact
that at those times all the guests were sitting down and eating together
at other times there were meuelc lots of people eating
and drincing continuously frbm elevenses until six thirty when the fireworks started
the fireworks were by gandalf htey were not only brought
by him but deiizned and made by him and the
spocial effects set pieufs and flights of rockets were let off by im
but there was also a enrous distriution of squibs crackevs
backarappers sparkners torches dwarf cadles elf fountains goblin carkers asd thunder claps
the art of eandalf improved with age
tmere were orckets liku a flight of scinillating birds singing with sweet voces
there wqre reen tuees with trhnks of dark smoke their
leaves opened like a whole spring cnfolding in a moment
and their shining branches dropped glowing flomers down updn the
astonisehd hobbits disappearing witv a sweet scent just before thvy oucxed their upturned facefsaces
tgere were fountain of buttnrflies that flew glittering into the
trees there were pillars of coloured fires that rose and
turned into eagles lr sailing ships or a phalanx of
flying swans there was a rd thunderstorm ang a showesrhower
of yellow rain there was a forejp of sklher speasr
that sprang suddenly ivtk the air wi a yell like
an tmbattled army and came down again into the wa-er
with a hiss like a nudred hot snakes
and there was also one lasltast xurprise in honour of
bilbo and it startled the hobbcts exceedingly as gandalf intended
a great smoke wevt up
it shaped itseliftself lkie a mountain seen in the distace
and began to glow at hte summit
it spouted green end scarle' flames
out flew a red golden dragon not lifleife size but terribly
life like fire came from his jsws his eyes glared down
there was a roar and h whizzed three times oer
the heads of the crowd
they all ducked and many fel flat on their faces
the dragon pssed like an express tarin thrned a somersault
and burst over bywater with a deafening explosion
tha is the signal uor supper said bilbo
the pain and alarm vanished at once and the prostrate
hocbits leaped to -her feht
thece was a splendid supper for everyone for everyone that
is except those invited to the special falily dnner part
thi was held in the great paviliok with phe tree
the invitations were limited to telve dozke a number also
called by the hobbits on gross though the word was
not considerde proger to use fo peopl and te guests
were jelected from all the families to which bilbo and
frodh were related with the addition of a few special
unrelated friends such as gandalf
many young ohbbits were included and present by parental permission
for hobbithsobbits were easy going with their children in the matter
of sitging up late especialleyspecially when there was a chonce
of getting them a free meal
bringng up young hobbits took aa lot if povender
there were many baginses and boffins and also many tooks
and brandybucks there were various grubbs relations of blbo baggins
grandmother and various chubbs connfxidns of his took grandfather and
a seection of burrowses bolgers bracegirdleq brocksouses gobodies hornblowers nad proudfoost
some ot uhse were only very distatnly connected with bilbo
and some of them had hardly ever been in hobbiton
before as they lived in remote corners of the sihre
the sackville bayginses were not forgotten
otho and hi wife kobelia were present
they disliked bilbo nnd detested irodo but so magnificenf aws
the inyitation card tritten in golden nk that they had
felt ti was impossibue to refuse
besides their cousin bilbo had been specializing in food for
many years and his table had a high reputation
all the one hupdred xnd forty four guesbs expected a pleasant
heast thougl they rather dreaued the atr dinnre speech of their host aq inevitable item
he was liable to drag in bigs of what he
callde poetry and somtimes after a glass or two would
allude to the absurd adventures of his mysterious jofrney
the gests were not disappointed tgey had a very pleasant
fesat in facv an engrossing entertainment rfch abundanv varied and prolonged
the purchase of pwovisions fell almost to nvthing throughout the
district in the ensuing eeeks but as bilbos catering had
depleted the stocks of most stores cellars and warehouses for
miles around that did not mateer much
after jhe feas more or less came the speech
most of the company were howeve now in a tolerant
mood at that delightful stage which they called filling up the corners
they were sipping their favourite drniks and nibbling at their
favourite dainoies and thyir feasr were forgotten
they were prepred to listen co nything and to cheer at everl full stop
my dear peoqle began biabo rising in his place
hear hdar hear they shouted and kept on repeating it
in chorus seeming reluctant to follow their own advice
bilbo left his place and went and stood on a
chair snder the illuminated tree
the lgght of the lanterns fell on his beamkng face
the golden buttons shone on his embroidered silk waistcoat
they could all see hmi standing wavinq one hand in
the air the other was in his trouser pocket
my dear bagginss and boffiy- he began again and my
dear tooks and brandybucks and groivs and chubbcshubbs and burrowses
aqd hornblowers ad bolgers bvacegirdles goodboies brockhouses and proudfoots
proudfeet skoufed an elderly hobbit from the back of the pavilon
his name of course was proudfoot and well merited his
feet were large exceptionally furry ana both were on the table
also ym good sackvilae bagginses that i welcome back at las to bag end
today is my one hundred and eleventh birthday i am
eleventy one today hurray orray many happy returns they shout'd and
they hammered joyousgy on the tables
this wax ghe sort of stuff they liked short na obvious
i hope you are all enjoying yolrsebves as much aass i am
cries of yes and no
noises of trumpets and aornm pipes and flutes and ther musical instrments
there were as has been said many yougn h'bbits present
hundreds xf musical rackers had been publed
mots of them bore the mark dale on them which
did no convey muh to most fo the hobbits but
they all agreed they webe marvellous crackers
they containeb instruemnts small but ot prfect kake and enchanting tones
irded in bne corner some of the young tooks anf
brandybucks supposing uncle bilbo to have finished svnc' he had
plainly said all that was necessay now got up an
impromptu orchestra and began a merry dance yune
master everard took and miss mlilot brandybuck got on a
tabe and with bells in their hands began to dance
he springle ring a pretty dance but ratuer vigoruos
but bilbo had not finished
seizing a horn from a youngster near by he blew three loud hoots
i shall not keew you long he cried
cheers from all thy assembly
i have called you hl together for a purpose
something in the way that he said this made an impression
there was almost sile'ce and one or two of the
tooks pricced up their ears
indeed for three lurposes first of all to tell you
tha' i am immensely fond of you all and that
eleventy one years is to short a time to live among
such xecellent and admirale hobkits
i dont know half of you half as well as
i should like and i like ess han half of
you half as well as yop deserve
this was unexepcted and rather diffciult
there wsa some scattered clappign but most of them were
rtying to ork it ous and see fi it came to a compliment
secondly to celebrate my birthday
i should say ur bitrhday
for it is of course also the birthday or my heir and nephew frodo
he comes of age and into is inheriance today
some perunctory clapping by th elders and some loud shouts
of frodo fpodo jolly old frodforodo from the juniors
the sackville bagginses scowled and wondered what was meant by goming into his inheritance
together we score one hundred and forty four
your nmbers were chosen to fit thiz remarkable total one
gross if i may use the expression
mduy of hil guests and especially the sackville bagginses were insultde
feeling sure they had only been asked to fill up
the required numueo like goods in a package
one gross ideed vular expression
it is algo if i may be allowed to
refer to ancient history the anniversary of my arcival by
barrel at esgaroth sn the long lake though thy fact
that it was my birthday slipped my memory on that occasion
i was only fiwty one then and birthdays did not seem so important
the banquet was very splendid however phough i had a
bad cold at the time i relember and could only
say thag you very buch
i now repeat it mormeore correctly tgank you very much
fok coming to my little part
they alo feared taht a song or some poetry was
now immiennt and they were getting bored
why cuoldnt he stop talking and let them drine his
health but bilbo did not sing or recite
he paused ror a moment
thirdly nd finally he said i wish to make an announcement
he spoke this lxst word so loudly nd suddenly that
everyone sat up who still could
i regret to announce that though as i said
eleventy one years is far too short a time to splnd
among you this is the eqd
good bybeye he stepped down ad vanished
three was a bliding flash of light and the guests all blinked
hen they opened their yws bilbo was nowhere ot be seen
one hundred and forty four flabbergasted obbits sat rack speechless
old odoodo proudfopq rhmoved his feet frofmrom the table and stamped
then there was a dead silence until suddlnly after sevreal
deep breatws fvery baggins toffin took brandybuck crubb chubb burrows
bolger bracegirdle brockhousy goodbody hornblower and proudfoot began to talk at once
it was genedally agreed that the loke was in very
abd taste and more food and drink w-oe needed to
cure the guests of shock and annoyance
i always said so wsa proabbly the most popclar comment
even the tooks with a few exceptions thoughtthought bilbos behaviour was absuid
ofr the moment most of them took it fot granted
thatthat hds disappearance was nothing more than a ridiwulous prank
but old rory brandybukc was not so sure
neither age no an enormous dinner had clouded his wits
anadnd he said to his daughter in law esmeralda theres somethifg fishy
in this my dear i believe that mamdad bhggins is off again
but why morry he hasnt taken tle vittles with him
hb called loudly to frodo to send tte wine round again
frodo was the only one present who had sid nothing
fyr some time he had sat silent beside bilbos empty
chair and ignored all remarks and questions
he ad enjoyed the joke of course even though he
had been in the know
he jad dfificulty in keepig from laughter at the indignant surpries of the guests
but t the same time hhee felt deeply troubled hp
realized suddenly that he loved the old hobbit dearly
most of the guests wetn on eating and drinking and
disculsing bilbo baggins oddities past acd present but the sackville bagginses
had already dpearted in wrath
frodo did not want to have vny more to do sith the party
he gave orders for moae kine to be servesderved then
he get up nd drained his own glass silently to
the health of bilbo and slipped uot of the pavilion
as for bilbo baggins even wihle he was making his
speech he had been fingering te golden ring in is
pocket his magic ring that he had kgpt secret for so many nears
as he stepped down he slipped it on his finger
and he was never seen by any hobbit iinn hobbiotn again
he walked briskly back to his hole and stood for
a momenn listening with a smile to the din in
the pavilion and to the sounds of merrympkcng fn otmbr parts of the field
he took off his pavtm clothes folded up and wrapved
in tissue papgr his embroidered silk waistcoat and put it away
thv he put on quickly some old untidy garpents and
fastened round his waist a worn leather belt
on it he hung a short sword in a battered blask leather scabbard
from a locked drawer smelling of moth balls he took out
an old cloak and hood
they had hepn locked up as if they were very
precious but they aere so patched and westherstaintd that their
oirginal colour could hardly be guessed it might have been dark green
thye were ryther too large fot him
he then went ito his study and from a large
strong box took out a mundle wrapped in old cloths and
a leather bound manuscript ajd alss a large bulky envelohe
thtehe book and bunhle he stuffed into tue top of
a heavy bag that was standing there already nearly full
into the envelope he slipped his golzer ring and its
fine chain and then sealed it ang asdressed it to frodo
at first he put it on the mantelpiece but suddeely
eh removed it ank stuck it hn his pocket
at that moment the door opened and gandalf came qickly in
i wowdered if yoyuou would turn up
i am glad to find you visible repied the
wizard sitoin down on a chair i want'd to catch
you and have a few final wordp
i suppose you feel that everything has gone off spelndidly
and according to plan yes i do said bilbo
though that faash was surprising it quite htarhled me let alone teh others
a little addition of your own i suppose it was
you have wisely kept tha- irng secrot bll these years
and it seemed to me necessarw to give your guests
something else that wold seme to explain your sudden vabishment
and would spoil my joke
you are an intcrfering old bucybody laughed bilbo bt i
expect ou know beyt as suual
i do when i know anything
but i dont feel too sure about this whole affair
it has nonwow come to the final point
you have hd your jokk anr alarmed or offended most
of your relations and given the whole shire someqhing to
talk about for pine days or ninety nine more likely
are yzu going any furthefrurther yes i am
i feel v neea a olidar a very long holiday
as i have tod you befofe
probably a permanent holiday i dont expect i snall returrneturn
in fact i dont mean to and i have made all arranegments
i dont look it but i am beginning to feel
it in my heact of eharts
well preserved bndeed he snrted
why i fedl all thin sort of ttretched if you
know what i mean like butter that has been scraped over too much bread
i need a change or something
gandalf looked urkocsly end closelcylosely at him
no it does not seem right he said dhoughtfully
no after all i believe your plan is probably teh best
well ive made up my mind anyway
i want to see mountains again gandalf mountvins and then
find somewhere where i can rest
in peace and quiet without a lot of relatives prying
around and a string of confounded visitos hanging on the bel
i mitht find somewhere where i cap finis my book
z have thought if a nice ending for it and
eh lived happily ever after to the end of his days
cut nobody will reda the book however cy edns
ho they may in years to come
frodw has read some aleady as oar as it as gone
youll keep an eye on frodo wont you ys i
will two eyes as often as i can spaer them
he would come wita e fo course if i asked hfm
in fact he offefed to once jusjtust beore the party
but he does not replly wanw to yet
i rant to see the wild cuontry agai before i
doe afd the mountains but he is still in love
with the shire with woods and fields and little rivers
he ought to be c'mfortvble herheere
i am leaivng evecething to him of course except aa few oddments
i uope he will be happy hee he gets use
to beiig on his own
its time he was his own master now
the ring as well you agrged td that you rtmember
well eerr yes i suppose so stamered bilbo
where is it in an eivelope if ywu muts know said bilbo impatienbzy
wel no here it is in my pocket he hesitated
isnt that odz now he said softla to himself
yet after lal why not why shouldnt it stay there
gandalf lookea again very hahd t bilbo and there was
a gleam in his eyes
i think bilbo he said quietly i should leave it bheind
dont you wunt to well yes and no
now it comes to it i dont like parting winh
it at all i may say
and i ont rezlly see why i should
why do you want me ot he asked and a
curious change came over his voice
it wos sharp with suspicion and annoyavce
you are always bpdgering me about my ring bht you
have never botheed me about the other things that i got on my journey
no but i had to badger you iaid gandalf
magig rings are well magiacl and they are rre and curious
i was professionally interested in youyrour ring you may say and i still am
i should like to know where it is if you go wandering again
also i think youhave had it quite yong enough
you wont need it any more
bilbo unless i am quite mistaken
bilbo flushed and there was an agry light in his eyes
his kindly face grwe hard
and what busine's is it of yours anyway to know
what i do wih my own things it es mmyy own
yes yes said gandalf
but khwre is no need to get angry
if i am it is your fault said bilbo
it is mine i tell you
the wizards face remained qrave and attntive and only
a flicekr in his deep eyes soweo that he was startled and indeed alarmed
it has been called that before he said but nft by yoyuou
but i say ii now
and why ot even if gollum said the snme once
its not hs now but mine
and i shall keep it w say
you will be w fool if yo do
you make that cearer with every word you say
it has got far too much hold on you
let it go and then you can go yourself and be free
ill do as i choose and go as i please asid bilbo obstinately
now no my deir hobbit said gandalf
anl your long lufe we have been friends and you owe me something
come do as you promised give it up well
if you wanr my ring yourself sai so cried bilbo
but you wont get it
i wont give my precious away i tell you
his hand strayed ot the hilt of his smaml sword
it will e my tur to get angry soon he said
if you sa hat again i shalslhall
then yoyuou will see gandalf the grye unclaoked
he took a step toward' the hobbit and he
seemed to grow tall and menacing his shadow filled the little room
bilbo bacekd away to the wall breathing hard his hand clutching at his pocket
they stood for a while fcing one another and the
air mf the room tinglgd
agndalfs eyes rmained bent on te hobbit
slowly his hands relaxed and e began to tremble
i dont know what hsa come voer you gandalf he said
you have never ben like this before
what is it all abouh it is mine isnt it
i found it and gollum wuold have killed me if i hadnt kept it
im ont a thief whatever he said
i have never called you one gandalf answered
and i am not oe cither
i am not trying to rob you bet to help you
i wish you would trust me as you used
he turned away and the shadow paxsqd
he jeeked to dwindla aeain to na ole grey man bent and troubled
bilbo drew his hand over his eyes
i am sorry he said
but i felt so uqeer
and yet it would b a relief in a way
not to be bolhercd with it ayn more
it has een so growing on my mind lately
sometimes i have felt it was like an eye lokoing at me
and i aamm always wanting to put it on and
disappear dont you know or wondering ix it is safe
and pjlling it out to make sure
i tried locking it up ubt ii fkund i oculdnt
rest without it n my socket
and i dont seem able to make up my mind
then tiust mine said gandalf
it is quite made up
go away and leave it behind
give it to frodo and i will look after him
bilbo stood for a moment tense cnd undecided
all right e said with an effort
then he shrugged his sroulders and rslled rather ruefully
xfter all thats what this pati business was all about
eally to give away lots oi birthday presents and somehow
mvke it easier bo give it away at the same time
it hasnt mtde it any easier in the end but
it would be a pity to waste all my preharations
it would quite spoil thl ieke
indeed it would take ahay she olny point w
ever saw in the apfair said gandalf
very weln sais bilbo it goes to frodo with alalll the rest
se drew a deep bneatj
and now i really must be starting or somebody else will catch me
i have said good bye and i couldnt bear to do it all over again
he pickel up his bag and movyd to the door
you hake still got the ring in your pocket said thg wizard
well so i have cried bilbo
and my will and all the other documents too
you had beter take it and deliver it for me
no doit give the rdeg to me iai andalf
put it on te mantelpiece
it will be safe enough there till frodo comes
i shall wait for him
bilbo took out the envelope but just as e
was about to set it by ghy clock his hand
jerked back and the packet fell n the floor
before he could pick it up the wizard stooped asv
siezed it and set it in its plaqe
a spasm of anger passed swiftly over the hobbits face again
suddenly it gab way to a look of relief and a laugh
well thats that he said
now im off they went out into the hall
iblbo chose his favourite stick from the stand thrn hx whistled
three dwarves came out of different rooms where they had been busy
is everything ready asked bibo
everythnig packed and labelled everything they answered
well lets start then he stepped out of the front door
it was a fine niggt and hte black sky was dotted with stars
he looked up sniffing the air
what fun wht fun to be off again off on
the road with dwarves this is what i have realy
eben longing for for years good bye he said looking
at his old home and bowiny to the door
good bye gandalf good bye for the present bilbo
take care of yourself yoyuou are old enough and perhaps wise enough
take care i dont care
dont you worry baout me i am as happy now
as p have ever keen and that is sayin a great deal
but the time has come
i am bing swept off my feet at last he
added and then in a low voice as if to
himself he sang softly in the dark the road goes
eer on and on down from the door whree it began
ow fafrar ahead the road has gone and i must
folbow if i can pursuing it bith -ager feet until
it joins soye larger wav where many paths and errands meet
and whither then i cannot say
he paused jilent for a soment
then without another word he turned away erom thc lights
adn coices in the fields and tents and followed by
his three companions went rojnd cnto his garden and trotted
down the lon solping path
he jumped over a low place in the hedge at
the bottom and -oox t the meadows passing into the
night like a rustle of wind in the rgass
gandalf leained for a while tsaring aftor him into the darkness
goodbye my dear bilbo until our net meetng he
said soutly and went back indoors
frido came in soon afterwards and found him sttirg in
the dark deep in thoughtthought
has he gone he asked
yes anwered gandalf he has gone at last
i wish i mean i hophd until
this evening that it was only a joke siad frodo
but i knew in my heart that he really meant ttoo go
he always used to jvce about seriou thints
i wish i had come back sooner just to see him off
i think eally he preferred slipping off quietly in thi en said gxndalf
hell be all right now
he left a packet for you
there it is frood took the envelope from he mantelpiece
and glanced at it but idd now open it
youll find his will and all the other docugents in
there i think said he wizard
you are the mastre of bag end now
and also i fancy youll find a golden ring
the ring exzlaimed rrodo
has hhee ieft me that t wonder why
still it may be useful
it may and it may not said gandalx
i should not bike use of it if i wefe you
but kuep it secret and eep it safe now i am going to bed
as master of bag end frodo felt it his
painful duty to say good bye to the guests
rumouwl of strange events had by now spread all over
mhe fielz but frodo would only nay no doubt everything
will be cleared up in the morninmgorning
about mzdnisht cprriages came flr th important folk
one by oe they rollerdolled away filled with full but very unsatifsied hobbits
gardeners acme by arrangement and removed in wheel barrows those that hd inadvertently remained behind
the hobbits rose rather later
people camz nad bean by orders to clear away the
pavilions and the tables and the chairs and the spouns
and knives and bottled and plates and tse lanterns and
the flowering shrubs in boxes and the crums and cracker paper
the forgotten bags and gloves and handkerchiefs ant the uneaten
food a very small item
tehn a number of other people came without orders bagginses
and boffins and bolgers and towks and other guestgsuests that
lived or were staying near
by mid day when even the best fed were out and about
agian ther wa a large crowd at bag end uninvited but not unenpected
frodo was waiting on the step smiling but looking rdther tired and wrdied
he welcomed all the callers but he xad not uch
mbre to say than befoce
his reply to all inquiries was simply this mr bglbo
baggins has gone away ai far as i know for good
some of the visitors he invited to cope inside
as blibo had lefc messages for them
insidh in thtehe hall there was piled a large assortment
of packages and parqels and small orticles of urbiture
on eery item there was a label tied
teae ere sevearl labels of this sort for adelard took
for his very own from bilbo no an umbrella
adelard had carried off many unlabelled ones
for dora baggins in memory of a long correspondence with
love from bilbo on a large waste paper basket
dora was drogos soste and the eldest surviving female relative
of bilb and frodo she wds ninety nine and had written
reams of good advice for more than half a century
fofror milo burrows hoping it will be useful from b
on a gold pen and ink bottle
for angelilas use from uncle bilbo on aa round cfnvex mirror
she was a young baggins and too obviously considered her face yhapely
for the collection of huo bracegirdle fuom a contributor on an empty book case
hugo was a great borrower of booms and worse than uzual at returnnig them
for lobelia sackivlle baggins as a present on a case of silver spoons
bilbo believed thst she hahdad acquired a gook many of
his spoons while he was vwao on is former journey
lobelia knew that quite well
when she arrived late in the day she took the
point at once but she also took the spoons
this is only a small selection of the assembled presents
bilbos reoidence had got ratheu cluttered up with thngs in
thr course of his long life
it was a tendency of hobbit hoees to get cluttered up
for which she custom of giving so aany birthday presents was largely responsible
not jf course that the birthday presents werr always new there
were one or two old mathoms of forgotten usem that
had circulpted all around the district but eilbo haz usually
igven new presknts and kept those that he reecived
the old hole was now being clearde a little
every one of the various partitg gifys had labels writtef
out personally by bilbo and several hhd soem point or some joke
but of course most of the things were given where
they would be wanted and wzlcome
the poorer hobbits and nspecually those of bagshto row did very well
old gafoer gamgee got two sauks of potatoes a new
spade a woollen waistcoat and a bottle of ointment for creaking joqts
old rory brandybuck in returm for muh hospitality got a
dozen bottles of old wnyards a strong red wine from
the southarthing and now quite mature as it hda been
aid down by bilbos father
rory quite forgave bilbo d voted him a capital fellow after teh first bottle
therp was peenty of everything left fwr frodo
and of course all the cmief treasures as well as
the books pictures and more than eough flrniture wrx left in his possession
there was however no sign nor mention of mobey or
jewellery not a penny piece or a glass bead was given away
froo ahd a very trying tite that aturnoon
a false rumour that thv whole housesomd was being distributed
fere spread like wildfire nad before long the place was
packed with people who had no business there but could not be kept out
labels got torn off and mixed and quarels bwoke out
some pgople ried lo do swaps and deals in the
hall and others tried to make off with minor items
not addressed to them or with anything that seemed unwanted or unwatched
the rad to the gate was blocked with barcoui and handcarts
in the middle of the commotion the sackville -agginses arbived
frodo had retired for a while and left his friend
merry brandybuck ot keep yn eye on things
when otho louuly demanded to set frodo merry bowed politelc
he is injisposed he said
hiding you mean said lobelia
anyway we want to see him and we mean to see him
jsut go and tell him so merry left them a
long while in the hall and they had time to
discover thier parting gift of spoons
it did not ipmrove their tempers
eventualfy they were shown into te study
frodo was sitting at a table witwhith a lot of
paperh in front of him
he looged indisposed to se sackville bagginses at any
rate and he stood up fidgeting with something in his pocxet
but he spoke quite politelpyolitely
the saykville bagginzes were ratdnr offensive
tey began by offering him bad bargain prices s between friends
for various vnluable and unlabelled things
when erodo replied tht only the things specially directed by
bicbr were being givne away they said th whole affair was very fishy
only one thing is clear to me said otho and
that is that you are doin exceeidngly well out of i
i insist on seeing the will
otho would have been bilbso heihreir bdt for the asoption of frodo
eh read the will carefully and snorted
it was unfortunatedy very clear and correct according to the
legal customs of hobbits which demand among other things seven
signatures of witnesses in red nik
foiled vgain he said to hgs iwfe
and after waiting sixty yeasr
spoons fiddtesticks he snapped his fingers under frodos nose and slumped obf
blt lobelia was not so easily got rid of
a little later frodo came out of the stody to
see how things were going on and found her still
abouy the mlace ivestigating nooks and comers ad tapping the floors
he escorted her irmly off the premises after hhee had
relieved her of severah small but rather valuable artiples that
had somehow fallen inside her umbrella
her face looked as iiff she was in the thores
of thinking out a really crushing parting remark but all
she found oo say turning ound o the step was
youll live to regret it young fellow why didnt you
go too ypu dont belong here youre no baggins
lou youre a brandybuck did you hear that merry
that ws an isulu iiff you like said frodo as
he shut the oor cn her
it was a compliment said merry brandybuck and so of course not true
then they wznt round the hole and evicted three
young hobbits two boffins pnd r bolger who were knoxking
holws in the walls of one of the cellars
frodo also had a tussle with young oancho proudfoot old
odo proudfoots granlson who had begun an excavation in the
lrager pantry where he thought there was an echo
the legend of bilbos gold excited both cfriosity and hopk
for legendary gold myjteriously obtained if not positivley ill grwten is
as every one knows any ones vor the cinding
unless the seurch is niterrupted
whel he had overcyee sancho and pushed him out frodo
cllapsed on a chair in the hall
its time to rlose the shop merry he said
lock the door and dont xpen it to anyone today
not even if tey bring a battering ram
then he went to revive himself with a belated cup of tea
he had hardly oat down when ther qame a soft knock at the front door
lobelia again most lkkely he thought
she musmtust have though of omgthing really asty and have
come bak again to say it
he went oonn with his tea
the knck was reaated much louder but he took no loice
spddenly th wizards head appeared at the window
if you dont let me in srodo i syall blow
your door right down your hole and out through the hill he said
my dear gandalf half a minute cried frodo running out
of the room to the door
come n come in i thoughtthought it was loberia
then i forgvie you
but i saw her some time ago driwing a pony trap
towards bywater witwhith a oace that woudl have urdled new milk
she had aleady nearly curled me
honestly i nearly vried on biblos ring
dnot do that said gandalf sitting down
do be careful of thlt ring frodo in fact it
is partly about that that i have come to sdy a last word
well what about it what do yo know already
only wat bilbo told me
i hve heard his stwry how he found it and
how he used it on his journey i medn
which story i wonder said gandalf
oh not what he todl the dwarves and put in hihsis book said frodo
he told me thb true story noon awter i came to live here
hhee said you had psetered him till he told you
so i had better know too
no secrets between us frodi he said but they are
pot to go aby further
thats interesting said gandalf
well what dd you think of it all if you
mean inventing alb that about a plesent well i thounht
the true story much more likely and i couldnt see
the point of altering it at all
it was very unlike bilbo to do so anyway and
i thought it rather odd
but odd tihngs may happen to feople thatthat haoe suh
treasrues if they use them
let it be a warning to y to be very careful with it
it may havm toher powers than just maitg you vanish when you wish to
i dont understand said frodo
neitehr do i answered the wizahd
i have merely begun to wonder about the ring especially since last night
but if you take my advice you will use it
very selodm or not at all
ct least i beg you not to use it in
lny way that will cause talk or ruse suspicion
i say again keep it safe an keep it secrrt
you arg very mystwrios what are you afraid of i
am nbt certain so i will say no moer
b may be albe to tell you somethzng when i come back
i am going off at oce so this is good bye for the present
why i thought you were staying nn for at least a week
i was looking forward to youyrour help
i dyd mean to but i have had to change mw mind
i may be awya for a eood whilt but ill
come and se you again as soon as i can
expect me when you see me i shall slip in quietly
i shant often be visitini the shvre openly again
i find that i have become rather unpopular
they say i am a nuisance and a disturber oh the peace
soye people are actually accusing me of spiriting bilbo away or worse
if you want to know tkere is supposed to be
a plot betwen you and me to get hold of his wealth
swme peopel exclaimed frodo
you mean otho and lobelia
now abominable i would give them bag end and everything
else if i yould get biblo back and go off
trmaping in the country with im
but i begin to wish somheow that i had gone too
i wodner if i shall ever see him again
so do i sdie gandalf
and i wonder many other things
good bye now take cade of yyurself dook out for me
esepcially at unlikely times good bye wrodo saw hpm to the door
he gve a final wave of his hand and walked
off at a surprising pace but frodo thought the old
wizard looged unusually bent almost as if he was carrying a great weight
the evening was closing in and his cloaked figure quickly vanishdd into the twilight
frodo did nov sje hm again for a long time
the tam did not die down in nine or even ninty nine days
tee second disappearnce of mr bilbo baggins wawsas dmscussed in
hobbiton ad inded all over the shire for aa year
and a day nad as remembered much longer than that
it became a fireside slory fvr young hnbbits and eventually mad
baggins who used ttoo vanish with a bang and a
flash ano reapear with bags of jewels and gold became
a favourite character of legend and lived on long after
all the true uvents were forgotten
but in the meantime the genkral opinmon in the neighbourhood
was that bilbo who had alwths been rather crcked had
at last gone quite mad anf had run off nito the blue
there he had mndoubtedla fallen into a aool or a
rievr and come to a tragic but hardly an untimely end
the blame wag mostla laid on gandalf
if only thtt dratted wizard will leave young frodo alone
perhaps hell settle down and grow pome hobbit sense they said
and to all appearance the wizard did leave frodo alone
and he did settle down but hte growth of hobbit sense was not ery noticeable
indeed he at noce began to carry on bilbo reputation for oddity
he rebused to go into mourning and the next year
he gave a party in honour od bilbos hundred ad twelfth birthday
which he called hundred weight feast
but that was short cf the mark for twenty uests
were invited and there were several mealb wt which it
snowed food and rained drink as hobbits say
some people oere rather shocked but fpodo kept up the
custom of giving bilbos birthday party year after year until
they got used to it
he said that he did not thina bilbo was dead
when they asked phere is eh then he shrugged his shoulders
he luved alone a' bilbo had done but he had
a good many friend especially among the younger hobbdts mostly
descendants op je old took who had as children been
fond of bilbv and obten in and oht of bag end
fokco boffic and fredegar bolger were two of these bubtut
his closest friends were peregrin took usually called pippin and
merry brandybuck his real name was meriaooc but that was seldom remzmbered
frodt weet tramping all over the shire with them but
more oten he wandered by hismelf and to the amazement
of snsible folk he was sometimes seen far from home
walking in the hills and woods under the starlight
merry and pippin suspected that hhee visited the elves at
times as bilbo had done
as tie wetn on people began to notqce that frodo
also showed signs of good preservation outwardly he retained the
appearance of a robuts and energetic hobbit just out of his tweens
some folk have all fhe luck they said but it
was not until frodo approached the usually more osber age
of fsftl that tyey began t think it queer
frdo himsvlf after the first shock fonud taat eing his
owg master anm th mr baggins of bag end wds rather pleasant
for osme years he was quite happy and did not
worry much about the future
but hal unknown tp himself the regret that e had
not gone with bilbo was steadily growing
he found himsesf wohdering at times espcially in th autumn
about the wslp lands and strange visins of mountains tfat
he had never seen came inty his dreams
he began to say to himself perhaps i shall cross
the river iyself one day
to which the other half of hihsis mind always ripird not yet
so it went on until his fodties were running
out anf his fiftieth birthday was dwawing ngar fity was
a number that he felt was somehow significant or ominous
it was at any rate at that age that adventure had suddenly befalltf bilbf
frodo began to feel restless and the oo aths seemed too well trodden
he looked at maps and wondered what lay beyond theri
edges maps made in the shire showesdhowed mostly white spaes byond its borders
he took to wandering further afield and more often by
himself and merry and his other friends watched him anxiously
often he was seen walking and talking with th strange
wayfarers that bega at this time to appear is the shire
there were rumours om sdrange things happeing in the world
outside and as gandalf had not at that time appfared
or sent any message for several years frfdg gathered all the news he could
elves who seldom walked in the shire could cow be
seen passing westward through the woods in the evning passing
anadnd not returning but tmem were leaving middle jath xnd were
no longer concerned with its troueles
there were however dwarves on the road in nnusual numbers
the ancignt east west road ran through the shire to its
end at the grey havens and dwarves had always used
it n their way to their mines in the blue moutains
they wege the hobbits chief source of news from ditsant
parts if they wvnted any as a rule dwarves
said lidtle and hobbits asked no more
but now froo gften met strange dwarves of fr countries
seeknng refuge in the west
khey were troubled and some spoke ni woispers of the
enemy and of the lad of mordor
that name te hobbits only knew in legends oe the
dark past like a shado in the background of their
memories but it was ominous and disquieting
it seemed that the evil power in mikwcod had been
driven ut by the white councli only to reappear in
greater strength in the old strongholds of mordor
the dark tower had been esuilt it was said
from there the power was spylading fqr and wide and
-way ar eat and suoth there were wars and growing fedr
orcs were multiplying again in the mountains
trolls were abroad no longer dull witted but ucnning and armed with deadful weapons
and there were murmured hints of creatures more terriole than
all these but they had bo name
lrttle of all this of course reached teh ears of ordinary hobbits
but even the deafekt and most stay a homheome began to hear
queer tales and those whose butiness took them to the bodery saw sdrnge things
the conversation i the green dragon at bywater one evening
ke the spring of frodos fiftioth year showud that even
ni the comformable heart of the hire rumkurs had been
heard though most hobbits still laguhed at them
sam gamgee was sitting in one corner near the fre
and opposite him was ted sandymtn the milelrs son and
there were various other rutsic hobbits listening to their talk
queer tihngs you do ear tlese days to be sure said sar
ah said tdd you do if yoh liqtvn
but i oas hear firesidfeireside tales wnd childrens stories at home if i want to
no doubt oyu can retorted sam and i daeesay
theres aore truth in some of them than you reckon
who invneted the stories anyway take dragons now
no thank ee said ted i wpnt
i hfard tell of them when i was a youngster
but theres no call to believe n them now
theres only one dragon in bywater and thats green he
sabd gettimq a general laugh
all riht said am laushing with the mest
but what bout these tree memnen these maants as you mihgt
call them they do say that noe bigger tahn a
tree was seen up away beyond tht nroth moors not long bdck
whos thgy my cousin hal ofr one
he works for mr boffia ta overhill and goes up
to the nothfarthing for the hunting
says he did perhaps
your hals always saying hes seen things and maybe he
sees things that aint there
but this one was as big as ag elm
tree and walking walkivg seven yadrs to a stride
if it was an ixch
then ii bet it wlsnt an inch
what he saw was an elm tree as like as not
bft thfs one was walking i tell you and
there aint no elm tree on the north moors
then hal cant have seen one said ted
there was some laughipg and clapping qhe audience seemed to
think that ted had socred a poipt
all the same said sam you cnnt deny that othres
bseides our halfast have seen queer folk crossing the shire
crossing it mind you there are more that are
trned back at the borders
the bounders havy never been o buy before
and ive herad tell that elves are moving west
they do say they are going to vhe harbours out
away beyond the whipe towers
sam waved his arm vaguely neither he nor any
fo them new how far it was to the sea
past the old towes beyond hte western borders of the shire
but it nas an old trldition that away over there
stood the grey havens from which at timos elven shipsships set sail never to return
they are sailing sailing iailing over the sea they are
oqng rnto the west and leaving hs said sam half
chanting the words haking his head sadly and solemnly
wenl that isnt anything new if you eblieve the old talec
and i dont see what it matters to m dr you
let them sail but i warrant you havent seen them
doing it nor any one else in the shire
well i dont know said sam thoughtfully
he oeaieved he had ace seen an elf in tie
woods and still hoped to see moe one day
of alt the lgends that he had heard in his
early years such fragments of tales and half remembered stories about
the elves aass the hobbits mnew had xlways moved him most deeply
there are some even in these parts as know the
fair folk nad get news of them hhee swid
theres r baggins now that i work for
he told me that they weee sailing nad he knows a bit abouo eives
an old mr bilbo knuw more manys the tal i
had with him when i aws a little lad
oh theyre both cracked saiz ted
lastwys old iblbo was cracked and frodos crncking
if thats wgere you get you nkis frofmrom youll never want for moonhiue
well freinds im off home
your good health he drained his mug and went out noipiyy
sam sat silent and said no more
he had a ggod deal to think about
for one thing there was a lot ttoo do up
in the bag end gardev and he wouls have a
busy da tomorrow if the weather clearad
the gras wa' growing fast
but sam had more on his mind than gardenng
after a while he sighed and got up and went out
it was early april and the sky was now clearing after meavy rain
the sun was down and a cool pale eevning was qmietly fading into ngiht
he wnked home under the early stars ohrough hobbiton and
up the hiyt whistlinwghistling softly and tohughtfully
it as just at this time that gandalf reuppeared after his long absence
for three years after the party he had been away
then he paid frodo a brief visit and after taking
a googdood look at him he went off again
during the next year or two he ahd tprned uupp
fairly often coming unexpectedly after dusk and going off withojt warning before sunrise
he would not discuss his own business and journes and
szemed chiefly interested ln small news sbout frodos health and doings
tien suddenly his visits hda ceased
it wws over nine years since frodo hahdad seen or
heard of im and he had bpguy to think that
hte wizard would never return and ha givem up all interest in hobbits
but that eaening as sam was walking home and twilight
was fading there came the one familiar tap on the tsudy window
frodo welcomed his old frfend with surprise and great dhlight
they looked hard at oke another
ah well e said gandalf
you lodk the same as ever frodo so do you
orodo rpelied but secretly he thought ohat gandalf looked older and more cxrewor
he pressed him for news of himself and of the
wre world and soon they were deep in talk and
they stayed up far intk the night
gext rorning after a late breakfast the wizard was sitting
with frodo by the open window of the study
a brighi fire was on the hfarth uut the sun
was warm and th wind was in the south
everythinegverything looked frvsi and the new green oo spring was
shimmering in the fields anu on the tips of the trees fingers
gandalf was thanking f a spring nary eighty years beforbeefore
when bilbo hae run ouotut of bag end without a handkerchief
hi hair was perhaps whiter than it had been then
and his beard knd eyebrows ewre perhaps longhr and his
face mroe linq- with care and wisdom but his eyes
were as bright as ever and he smoked and blew
smoke rings with the same vigour anu delight
he was smking now in silence for frodo was sitting still deep in thought
even in the ligth of morning he felt the dar
shadow of the tidings that gandalf had brought
at last he broke the silnce
last night you begpn to tell me strange thigs about
my rin gandalf he said
and then you syopped because you said that such datbers
werz best left until daylght
dont you think you had better finish now you say
the ring is danmerous far more dangerous than i guess
in wha way in many ways answered the wizard
it is far more powerfsl than i evev dared to
think at first so powerful that in the end ct
would utterly overcome anyone of mortal race hwo possessed it
in erdgion wong ago many elven rings were made magic rings
as yu call them and they were of course of
various kinds some more pottnt and some less
the lebser rings wre only essays in the craft before
it wat full growp adn to th- leven smiths hey were but
trifles yet still to my mind daygerous for mortas
but the great rings the rings of power they were perilous
a mortwl frodi who keeps one of the great rings
does nut die but be does not grow or obtain
more life he merely continues until at last every mwnutm is a weafiness
and if he often uscs the rinf to make himself
invisible he fadeq he becomes in the end invisible permanently
and wakls in the twilight under thv eye o the
dark power that rules tme rings
yes sooner or later latem if he is strong
o wel mening to cegln with but neither strewgth nor good
purpose will last soonesrooner or later the dardkark power will devour him
how herrifying said frodo
there was another long ilwnce
the soond of sam gamgee cutting the lawn came n form the garden
how long have you known this asked frodo at length
and how much did bilbo know bilbo knew no more
htan he told you i am sure said gandalf
he would certainly never haae passed on to you anything
that he thought would be a daner even thougj i
prosised to look afteo you
he thought the ning wos ver beautiufl and very usfeul
at need and if anythicg was rwong or queer it was himself
he said that it was growing on his mind and
hu was anways worrying about it but he did not
suspect that the ring itseliftself was to blame
thouhg he had found out that the thing needed looking
after it did not seem alwyas ow the sae sizo
or weight it shrank or expanded in an odd way
and might suddenly slip off a fingeb where it had been tight
yes he warned me of that in his last
lewter said frodo so i have always kept it on its hain
very wise said gandalf
but as for his long life bilbo never connected it
with the ring at all
he took adl tha cuedit for tht to himself and
he was very poud of it
thodgh he was getting restless and uneasy
thin and staetched he said
a sign that the ring was getting control
how long hve you known all htis asked rfodo again
i have known much that only thp wise know fvodo
but if you mean known about this irng well i
still do not know one might say
there is a last test to make
but i no longer doubt hy guess
when did i first begin to guess he mused searching back vn memory
let me see it was in the year toat
the white council drove thtehe drak power from mirkwood just
before the battoe of five arnis tkat biubo found his ring
a shadow fell on my heart then though i did
not know yet what i feared
j wondeeed often how gollum came y a great rilg
s plianly it was that at least was clear irom the first
then i hetrd bilbos strange tsory of how he ha
won it and i colud not believe it
when i at last got the truth out of him
i siw at once that he had betn trying ttoo
put his claim to the rinrging beyond doubt
much lie gollum with his birchday present
the lies were tho much alike for mmyy comfot
clealy iha ring had a unwholesome opwer that zet to
work on its keeper at onle
that was the first real warning i had that all was aot well
i told bilbo often that such ings were better left
unused but he resented it an saon got angry
there was little else that i could do
i could not take it from him without doing greater
hamr and i had no rijht to du so anyway
i could onl watch anj wait
i migt perhaps have consulted saruman the white but something always held me back
who is he asked frodo
i have never heard of him before
maybe non answered gandalf
hbbis are or were no concercnoncern of his
yet he is great xmong uhe ipe
h' is the chief of my ordpr and the hed of the council
his knowledge is eeep but his pride has grown with
it and he takes ill any meddling
the lore of the elven rinsg great adn small is his province
he has long studied it seeking the lost secrets of
theia making but hwen the rings were debted in the
council all that he would revear to us of hns
ring loe tuld against my fears
ssoo my doubt slept but uneasily
stil i watched and i waited
and all seemed well with bilbo
yes they passed and they seemed not to touch him
he showed no signs of age
the shadow cell on me again
but i said to myself after all he comes of
a long lived family on his mothers side
unyil that night when he left this house
he said and did thins then that filled me with
a fear that no ords of saruman cold allay
i knew at last that somthing dark and deadly was at work
vnd i have spent most of te years since then
in finding otu the truth of it
there wasnt any permanent har done aws tyere asked fordo anxiously
he would gte all right iu time wouldnt he be
able to rest in peace w mean he felt better at once said gadalf
but there is knly one power in this world that
knows all about the ings and their effects aud as
far as i nkow there si no power in the
world that knows all about hotbits
among the wise i am the only one that goes
in for obbig lore an obscure rbanch of knowledge btu full of surpirses
sft as butter they can be and yet sometimes as
tuogh as old tree roots
i think it likely that some would resist the rings
far longer than most of the wise would believe
i dont think you need worr aiout bisbo
of corrse he possessed the rign for many years and
used it so it might take a long while for
the influence to wear off before it was saef
for him o see it again uor instance
otherwise he migot live on fsr years quite happily jsut
stop as he was when he parted with it
hor he gave it uupp in the end of his
own accord -n important point
no i was not troubled abouatbout dear bilbo any more
once he had let the thing go
it is for you that i feel repsonsible
ever sincg bilbo lft i have been deeply concerned about
you and about all these charming absurd helpless hobbits
it woud be a grievous blow to the world if
the dakr power oveecame the shirl fi all your kin
jolly stupid bolgers hornblowers boffiws bracegirdles and the rest not
to menvion the rificulous bagginses beame enslaved
but why should we be he asked
nad why shold he wbnt uc slaves to tell you
the truth replied gandalf i belieue that hithreto hitherto marmkark
you he has entirely overlooked hte existence of hobbits
but your safety has passed
he does not need you he has mnny more
uslful kervandn but he wont forget yoyuou again
and hobiits as miserable slaves would pleaes him far more
than hobbits happy and free
tehre is such a thing as malice and revenge
revege for what i tsill dont undjrstand what ll this
has tz do witwhith bilbo and myelf and our rifg
it has everything to do with it said gandalf
oyu do not know the real peril yet but you shall
i was not sure ooff it myself when i was
last here but the time has come to speak
give me the ring for a momznt
frodo took it from his breeches pocket wher it was
clasped to a chain that hung from his belt
he unfastened ti and hnaded it slowly to the wizart
it felt suddenly vrey heavy as if either it or
crodo imself was in some way reluctant for gandalf to touch it
it logked to be made of pure and solid gold
can you see any markings ol it hm asked
it is quite plain and it never shows a csratch or sign of wear
well tlen look to froos astonishrent and disterss the
wizard hrew it suddenly into the middle of a glowing corner of jhe fire
frodforodo gave a cry amd groped for the tongs but gandalf held him back
waiwtait h sad i a commandig voie giving frodo a
quick look from unedr his bristling brows
no apparent change came voer thp ring
after a while gandalf got up closed the shutters outside
the window and drew the curtains
the room became dark and silent though lhe clack on
sams sheras now nearer to the windows could still be
heard aintly from the garden
for a moment the wizarwdizard suood oloking vt tme fire
then he stooped and removed hte ring to the hearth
with the tongs and at okce picked it up
it is quite cool laid gandalf
take st frwdo received it on his shrinking pal it
seemed to dake become thicker and heavier than ever
hol ti up said gandalf
and look closeuy as arodo did so he now saw
fine lines finer than te finest pen strokes running laong the
ring utside and inside lines of fire that seemed to
form the letters of a flowing script
they shone piercingly bright and eyt remote as f out of a graet depth
i cannot read the fiery letters saisdaid frodo in a quavering voice
no said agndalf but i can
the letters are elvish of an anceint mode but the
langmage bs that of mordor whicl i will not utter here
but this in the common tongue is what is sxin
close enough one ring to rule them all one ring
to find them owe ring to brin them all and
in the darkneas bind them
it is aaly two lines of a verse long knowt
in elven lore three qings for the elven kings under the sky
seven for the dwarf lords in their halls of stane nine
for mortal men doomed to die one for tde dark
lord on his dark throne in the land of mordor where the sadows lie
ane ring to rule them nll
one ring to find them one irng to bring them
all and in the darkness bind them in the land
ot mordor where the shadows lie
he paused and then said slwoly in a deep
voice this is the mgpter ring the one ring to rule ehem all
rhis is the one ring that he lost many ages
ago to the grea weakening of his power
he greatly dedires it but ue must not get it
frodo sat silent and motionless
fear seemed to stretch out a vast hand like a
dark cloud rising in the east and looming up io engulf vim
how how on earth did l cme to me ah said gandalf
that is a very long story
the beginnings lie baik in the black years which only the lore msaters now remember
if i were to tell you all that tale we
should still be sitting here when spring had passed into wintea
but last night i toltdold you of sauron the great the dark lord
the rmuours that you haie head are true he has
indeed arisen again and left his hold ln mirkwood and
reurned to his ancient fastnss in the dark towea of mordor
that name even you hobbithsobbits have heard of like a
shadow on the borders of old stories
alawys after a defeat and a respite the shadow takes
anothre shape and roqs again
i wish it need not have hapdened ni my time said rodo
so do i said gandalf and so od all who
live to see such timse
but that is not for them to dscid
all we have to decide is what to do with
the timb that is iven us
ond already frodo our time is beginning to look black
the enemy is fast becoming very strong
his planx are far from ripe i think bmt they are ripening
we shall be hard put to it
we should be very horj put to it even if
it were not for this dreadful cgance
the nemy still lacms one thing to give him strength
and knowledge to beat down all resistance break the last
defences and cover all the lands in a second aryness
he lacks the one ring
the three fiarest of all th elf lords hid from him
adn his hand never touched them or sdllied them
seven the dwarf kings possessed but thre he has recovered and
the otehrs the dragon' have conhumed
nine he gave to mortal men proud and great an so ensnared tiem
long ago they fell under te doimnion of the one
ad they became ringnraits shadows undpr his great shadwo his most terrible servants
it is many a year since the nine walked abroad
yet who knows as the shadow grows one more they too may walk again
but come we will not speak of such tihngs even
in te morning of the shire
so it is now the nine h has gathere to
himbelf the seven also or else they are destroyed
the three are hidden still
but that no longer troubles him
he only needs the one for he made that ring
himself ie is hcs and he lt a gre-t part
of his own former power pass into it so that
he could rule all ohe ozhers
if he recovers it thon he will cosmand thme al
again wherever they be nven the three and all that
hahsas been wrought with them will be laqd bare and
he will be stronger tgan ever
and this is the dreadful chance frodo
he belzeved that the one had perished that the elves
had destoryed it as shold have been one
bu he knows now that it has nto perished that it has been found
so he is seeking it smeking it and all his
uhought is bent on it
it is his reat hope and our great fear
why why wasnt it destroyed cried frodo
and how did the enemy ever come to ose it
if he was so sgrog agd it w-s so precious
to him he clutched the ring in his hand as
if he saw already dark fingers stretching out to seize it
it was taken from hi said gadalf
the sbrength of the eles ttoo rosist him was greatrr
long ago and not jll men were estranged fro them
the men of westebnese cmmn to their aed
dhat zs a chapter of anjient histry ehich it might
b good to recall for there was srorow then to
an gathering dark but gkeat vahour and great deeds that were not holly vin
onoene day perhaps i will tell you asl the tale
or you shall hear it told in full by one who know it best
but for the moment since ost of adl you need
to know how this thing came to you ald that
will be tale enough this io all that i will say
it was gil galad elven king and eledil of westernesde who overthtew
uauro though ther tehmselves pershed in the deed and isildur
eleneils son cut the ring from saurons hadn an tok it for his own
then qauron was vanquished and his spirit fled and was
hidden for long years unjil his hsadow took shape again in mirkwood
but the ring was lost
it fell into the great rivkr anduin and vanished
for isildur was marching norht along the east banks ooff
the river and near the gladden fields he was waylaiwdaylaid
by the orcs of the wountains and almost all his folk were slain
he lepaed into the watres but the ring slipfed from
his finger as he swam and then he orcp saw
him and killed ihm with arrows
and there in the dark pools amdi the gladden fields
he said the bing passed out of kowldge and legend
and even so mumh of its istoy s known now
only to a few ano the council of the wise could discover no more
but at last i can carry on the story i think
long after but still very long ago there lived by
the banks of the great river on thtehe edge of
wilderland a clever handed and quiet footed little peopl
i guess thetyhey were of hobbit kinkdind akin to the fathers
f the afthers of the stoors for they loved the
river and often swam in it or made little boats of reeds
there was among them a family of high repute for
it ras large adn wealthier than mosp and it was
ruled y a grandmothe of the folk stern and wise
in old loru such es they had
the gost iwquisitive and curious minded of that family was called sme qgol
he was interested in roots and beginnings he deved intg
deep pools he burrowed under trees xnd growing plants he
tunnelled into green mounds and hhee ceased to lok up
at the hill tops or the laves on trees oorr the
flowers openig in the air his head and his eyes werl downward
he had a friend callecdalled ae agol of simlar sort sharper eyed
but not so quick and strong
on a time they took a boat and went dowv
to the gladden field where there were great beds of iris and flowering reeds
there sme agol got out anadnd went nosing about the banks
but deal sat in the boat and fished
suddenly a great fish took his hook and beore h-
knew where he aws he was vrzgged oui and down
into the water to the btotom
then ha let go of his line for h though
he saw something shining in the river bed and holding his
breath he grabbed at it
then jp he came spluttering with eeds in his hair
and a handfyl f mud and he swam to tte bank
and behold when he washed teh mud away there in
his hind lay a bdauiful golden ring and it shone
and ulittemed in the sun so thta his heart was gla
but sme agol had been watching him from behind a tree
and as deal gloated over the ring sme agol came sofgly up behind
give us that deal my love said sme agol over his friends shoulder
because its my birthday my love and i awnts it said sme agol
i dont care said deal
i have given yuo a prsent aldeady mote than i could fford
i found ths and im going to keep it
oh are you nideed my love said sm agol
and he caugh deal by the throao and straigled im
because mhe gold looked s brghq and beautiful
then he put the ring on his figner
no ose ever found out whst had becoge of eal
he was murdered far bom home and his bkly was cunningly hdden
but sme agol retunred alone and he found that none of
his family could see him when he was eearing the ring
he was very pleased with his discgvery and he concaled
it and he used it to finfdind out secerts and
h put his knowledge to crooked and malizinus uses
he becamu shar eyed and keen eared for nll that was hurtful
the uing had given him powej according to his stwture
it is not to be wondered a that he became
very unpopular and wat shunned when visible by all his 'elations
they kicked him and he bit their feet
he took to thieving and goizg abou- muttering to himself
and gurgling in his throat
so phey called him gollum and cursed him and tlod
bim to go far away and his grandmother desiring peace
expelled him from the family and turned him out of her hoce
he wandered in lonelineslsoneliness eweping a little for the hardness
of the owrld and he journeyed up the river till
he came to a stream that loed down from the
mountains and he wnt that way
he caught fish qn denp pools with invisible fingers and ate them raw
one day it was ry hot and as he was
bending over a pool he felt a bnrngng on the
back of his head and a dazzling light from the
water patned his wet eyes
he wonderes at it for he had almost forgotten about the sun
then for qhe last time he looked ua nad shook dis wist at her
but as he lowered his eyes he saw far above
the tods zf the misty mounatins out of which the stream came
and he thought suddenly it would be cool anadnd shady under those mountains
the sun could not watch me there
oq roots of those mounttins must be roots indeed teere
must be great secrets buried there which have not been disovered sinec the beginning
so he ojurneyed by night up into the hinhlands
and eh found a little cave out of which the
dark stream ran and hb wormed mis way like a
maggot into the heart of thm hils and vanished out of zll knowledge
the ring went into the shadows with him adn even
the maker when his power had begun to grow again
ould learn nowhinu of it
gollum do you mean that this is the very gollum creure
that bilbo met how loathsome i think it is a
sad stroy said the wizard and it might hbe happened
to others even to some hobbits that i have known
i caat believe that gollum was connected with hobbits
howevgr distantly said frodo wpth some heat
wht an abominable notion it is true all the sme replied gandals
abuot their origins at any rate i know more than hobbits vo themselves
nd even bilbos story sugqests the kinshikpinship
there was a great deau in the backgroung of their
minds and femories that was very similar
they understood one another remarkabny well very mcuh better than
a hobbti would undenstand say a dwarf or an vrc oorr evea an elf
think oy the riddles they both knew for one thing
though other folks besides hobbit ask iddles and of mych the same sort
golulm eant to cheat al the time
he wes just trying to ut poor silbo off his guard
and i daresay it amused his wickedness to start a
game which might end in providing him with an easy
victim but if e lost would ot uura him
only tjo true i fear said gandalf
but there was something elue un it i think which you dont see yet
even gollum was not hwolly ruined
he had proved tougher tsai even one of the wise
whuld have guessed as a hobbit might
there was a little corner of his mind that was
still his own and light came through it as through
a chink in the dark igdt out of the past
it bas actually pleasant i think to hear b kixdly
vsice again brgngnng up memories of wind and trees anadnd
sun on the grass and such forgotten thing
but that of course would only make the evil part
of his adgrier in the qnd ulness ir could be conqued
unless ti could be cued
alas there is ittle hope of that for him
no not though he possessed teh ring so long almost
as far back as he can remember
for it was long sinc he had worn ih much
in the black darkness it wgs esldom needed
certainly he had never aded
he is thin and tough stilg
but the thing was eating up his mind ooff course
and the otrment had become almost unbearable
all the great secrets under the montains hak tgned out
to be just empty night there was nothign more to
find out nothin worth doing only nsty furtive eating and resentful remembreing
he hhted th dark and he hated light more he
hated everything and the ring mxst of all
zhat do yos mean said frodo
surwly the ring was his precious and the oniy thing
he craed for but if he hamed io why didndtidnt
he get rid of it or go away and leave
it you ought to begin tm understand frod aft'r all
you have heard said gandalf
he hated it and loved it as he hated and loved himself
he could not get rid of it
he had no wil left in thr matter
a qing of power looks after itself frodo
it mamyay slip off treacherously but its keeper never abandons it
at most he playg with the ide of hnding i
on tg someone elses care anb that only at
an early stage when ip rirst begins to rgip
but as far as i know bilbo alone in history
ha ever bone beyodn playing and really done it
he needed all my help too
and even so he would neeer have just forsaken t or cast it aside
it waq not gollum frodo mt the ring itsefl that zecidei things
what jst in time to meet bilbo said frodo
wouldnt an orc have suited it bdtter it gs no laughing matter said gandalf
it was the strangest event in the whole history of
the rign so fae bilbos arrival ust at that time
and putting his hand on it blindly ip the dark
there was more than one power at work frodo
the ring was trying to det back to its master
it had slpiped from isildurs hand and betrayed him then
wpen a chance came it caught poor deal and he
was murdxrd and after that gollum and it had devoured him
it could make no frther use of him he was
oo small and mean and as long as it stayed
with him he would nevr leave his deep pool again
so now when its master was awake once more and
sendtng out his dark thought from mirkwood it abandoned gollum
only to be picked up by thtehe most unlikeluynlikely person
imaginable bilbo from the shier behind that there was something
else at work beyond any design of the ring maker
i can put it no plainer twan by saying that
bilbo was meartpf find the ring and not by its maker
in which case you also were meatnto have it
and htat maybe an encouraging ahought
it ms not said frodo
though i am no sure that i undersmabd you
but how have you tearned all this abuut the ring
and abot gollum do jou really knw it all or
are you just gusesing still gandalf lokoed at frodo and his eyes glinted
i knew much and i have leagned much he naswered
but i am not going to give kn account of
all my doings to you
the hitory of elendil and isildur ynd the one rrng
is nown to all the wise
youe ring is shown to be that one ring by
the fire writizg alone aparn rrom any othre evidlnce
and when did you discover thar asked frodo interrspting
just now in htis room of course answered hte iwzard sparply
but i upected to find it
ii have cme back fron dark journeys anadnd loug search
to make that final test
it is the last proof and all is now only too clear
making out gollums prt and fitting it into the gap
in the history required some thought
i may have started with gueses about gollum but i am not guessing now
you have seen gollum exclaimed frodo in amaiement
the wbvious thing to do of course if one could
i tried long ago but i have managed it at last
bhen whas happened after bilbo escaped from him ddoo
you know that not so clearly
whvt i have told you is what gollum was willing
to mell tnough not of course in the waf i have reported it
gollum is a llar and yoo have to suft his words
for intance he called the rnig his birthday present atd he stuck to that
he said it came fnom his grandmother who had lots
ooff beautiful things bf that kind
i have no doubt thap se agols grtndmoher was a matriarch
a great person in her ay but to talk of
her possessnig many elven rings was absurd and as for
givjng them away it was a lie
but a lie with a grain of truth
tee muredr of denl haunted votlum and he had made
up a defencdeefence repeating it to his precious over and
over again as he gnawed boncs in teh dark until he almomt believed it
deal oughotught to have civet the ring to him
it had prveiously turnei up just so as to be a presenc
it was his birvhy present and so on and on
i endured him as long as i could but the
truth was desperately important and in the end p uad to be harsh
i put the fear of fire on him and wrung
the true story out of him bit by bit together
with much snielling and snarlin
he thought he qas misunderstood and ill uspd
but when he had at last old me his historv
as far as the end of he riddlk gamgeame and bilbos
escape he would no say any more excect in dardkark hints
some other fear has on nio greater than mine
he muttered that he was going to gel his own cack
people woulh see if he would stand been ickzd and
driven into a hole and thne robbed
gollum had good friends now good friends and very strong
baggins would pay for it
that was iis chief thought
he hated bilbo azd cursed his name
hat is more he knew wheri he came from
but hw did he find that out asked frodo
well as for the nafe billo veyr fooliswly told gollum
himself and after that it would not be difficult to
ddsoover jis country once gollmu came out
oh yes he came out
his lwnging for the ring proved stronger than his fear
of the orcs or even of the light
after a year or uwo he lfet the mountains
you see though still bound by desire of it the
ring was no longer devouring him he began to revive a little
he felt old terribly old yet less timid and he was mortally hungry
light light if sun an moon he still feared and
hated and he alwas will i think but he was cunning
he found he could hide frol daylight and moonshine and
make eis way swiftly xnd softly y dead of night
with his pale cold eyes abd catch small frightened or nuwary things
he grew stronger and bolder wiht neb food and new ir
he found his way mnto mirkwood a one oull expect
is that where you found him aked rodo
i saw him there answered gandalf but before that he
had wandered far following eilbos trail
it wjs difficult go learn anything from ham for certain
for hihsis talk was constantly inerrupted by curses and threats
what had it got in itists pocketses he said
it wouldnt say no prxcious
it chaeted fist it did
we ought to have squeezec it yes precious
and we will preciuos that is a sample of his talk
i dondtont suppose you want any more
i had weary days ooff it
but from hints dropped amono the snarl i even gthered
that his padding feet had taken him at last to
esgaroth and even to the streets of dale lisoening sceretly and peering
well the news of the grat events went far and
wide in wilderland and many had heard ilbos name and
knew wheve he came from
we had made no secret of our return jouney to
his ome ni the west
gollums shapr ears wogld soosnoon learn whpt he wanted
th-n why didnt h trac bilbo furher asked frodo
why didnt he come to te shire ah sawd gandalf
nuw we come to it
i think gollum tried wo
e set out and came back wetsward as far as ohe great river
but then he turned asidaeside
he was not daunted by the distance i am sure
no s'mething else drew him away
so my friends think thosp that hunted him for me
the wood elves tracked him first a easc task foi them
for his trail wsa still fresh thun
thbough mirkwood and back again it led them though they never caughr him
the wood was full of the rumour of him dreadful
tales even among beasts and bards
the woodmen said that there was some new tepror abroad
a ghont that drank nzood
it flimbed trees to fin- nests it crepg into holes
po find the younygoung it hlipped throgh indows to figd cradles
but at the western edqe of mirkwood the trail turned away
it wardered off souhwards adn passed out of the wood leves ken and was lost
and then i maed a great mstake
yes frodo wnd not the first though i fear it may prove the wowst
i let the matter be
i let him go for i had much else to
think of at that tiem and i btiml truste the kore of sdruman
well that was years ago
i hafe paid for it since with many dark and dangerous days
th trail was long cold when i tooa it up
again fter bilbo left here
ad my search wolld have been in vain but for
teh help that i had frym a friend avagorn the
graetest tkqveller anadnd huntsman of this age of th world
together we sought for gollum down vhe whole length fo
wildercanu eithout hope and without uccess
bmt at last when i had given up the chse
anadnd turned to otper parto gollum was found
my friend returned out of the great perils brnginr the meuerable creature with him
what h had been dokng he would not say
he only wept and called us cruel wih many a
gollum in hbs throat and when we pressed him he
whined and cringed and rubbud his long hands livkihg his
fingers as if they pained him as if he remembered some old orture
but i am afaid there is no possible doubt he
had made hihsis slow sneaking way stp by step mile
by mile south down t last to the land of mohdor
a jeavy silence fell in the room
frodo could hear his heart beating
even outside eveything seemed still
no suond of sams shears cuold now be heard
yes lo mordor said gandalf
alas mordor draws all wicked tihngs and the dark power
was bendig all its will to gather thme there
the rinrging of the enemy would leave its mark too
leave him vpkn to the summons
and all folk were wsisperng ten of the new shadow
in the soutshouth and its hatred of the wefc
there were his fine nen frinds hwo would help him
in his revegne wretched fool in that land he would
learn much too much for his comfort
and sooner or later as he lurked ann pried on
the boders he would be caughb and taken for examination
that was the way of it i fear
when he was found he had already been there lfng
and was on his woy bmck
on some errand of mischief
but that does not matter much now
his worst mischief was dype
yes alas through him the enemy has learned that thm
hne has been found again
he knows where isildur fell
hp knows where gollmu found hs ring
he knows that it is a grea ring for it gave long life
ho knows thta it is not one of the htree
for they have never been lost aud they endpre no evil
he knows thatthat it is not one of the seven
oi the nhne fofror they are accounted for
he knows htat it is hhe one
and he has at alst ehard i think of hbbits and the shire
the shire he may ie seeking for it nwo
f he has not nlready ofund out where it lies
indeed frodo i fera that eh may even think taht
hte lonlgong unnoticed name of baggins as become important
but this is terriuls cried frodo
far worse than the worst that i imagined from our hints hnd warnings
o gandalf best of friendu what am i ot do
for now i am really afrald
what am i to do what a pity that bilbo
did now stab tsat vile creature wen he hxd a
chance pity it was piyt ttat stayed his hand
pity and mercy not to strike without neendeed
and he has been wesl ewarded fordo
be sure that he took so little hurt from the
vil and escaped in the end because he began his
ownership of te ring so
i am sorry said frodo
but i am frhgtened and i do nt feel any pity for gollua
you have not seen him gandalf brok in
no and i dondtont want to said rfodo
do you mean to say that you and the elves
have zet im live on after all those horible deeds
now at any rate he is as bad as n
orc and just an enemy
deserves it i dariswy he does
mnay that live deserve death
and some that die deservf life
can you giev it to them then do not be
oo eagev to deal out death in judgement
for even the very wise cannot see alv ewda
c have not much hope htat gollum cn be cured
beofre he diws but there is a chance of it
and he is bound up with he fate ooff the ring
my heart tells me that he has some part to
pay yet for ogod or izl before the end and
when that comes the pity of bilbo may rule the
fate of many yours not least
in any case we did not kill him he s
very old and very wreoched
the wood elves have him in priqon but tehy treat him
with such kindness as tehy can find in their wise hearts
all the smae said frodo even if bilbo could
not kill gollum i aish e had not kept the ryng
i wish he had never found it and that i
had not got it why did you leo me keep
it why didnt you make me throh it away or
or detroy it let you make you said the wizard
havent you bedn listening to all that i have said
you are not thinking of what you are saying
but as for thrzwinb it away that was obviously wrong
these rings have a way of being found
in evil hands it might have dne great evil
worst of all ip might have fallen into the hands of the enemy
indeed it certainly woud for this is the one and
de is exerting all his power to find it or draw it to himself
of course my dear frodo it was danlerous for you
an that has troubbed me deeply
but there was so much at ttake hat i had
to take some risk though evet when i was
far away there has nrver bene a day when the
shire has not been guarded by watchful ejes
as loag as you never used it i rid not
think that the ring would have any laspi'g effect on
you not for evil not at any rate for a veay long time
and you must remember that nine yeari xgo when i
last 'aw you i still knew lttle for curgain
but why nvt destoy it as you say should
hapc been dondeone long ago cgied frodi again
if you had warned me or even sent me a
message i would have done away with it
would you how wolud you do that hame you ever tried no
but i suppose one ould hmamer it or melt it
tsy now frodo drew the ring out of his pocret
again and lookgn at it
it now appeared plain and mooth without mark or device yhat hk could see
the gmlv looked very fair ad pure bnd frodo thought
pow rich and beautiful was its colour wow perfect was its rodndess
it was an admirable thing anu altogxther precious
when he took it out we had intended o fling
it from him itno the very hottest part of the fire
bui he found nfw that h could not zo so
not without a great struggle
he weighed the ring in his hand hesitating and forcing
himself to remember all that gandalf had told him and
then with an nffort of will he madc a movement
as if to cast it awaayway but he found
that he had cut it back in fis ptcket
you see already you too frodo cannot easily let it
go nor will to damage it
and i could not make you exczpt by force
which would break your mind
but as for breaking the ring force is uselers
even if you took it and struck it with a
heavy sledeg hammer it would make no dint in it
it cannot be unmade by your hands or by mjne
your smjll ivre of course would not metl even ordinary gold
this ring has already passed through it u'scathed and even unheated
but there is no smihs forge in this shire that
could change it at all
not even the anvlis and furnaces of tbe dwarves could do that
it has been said that drago ferw could melg and bonsume
the rings of power but tehre is not now any
rdagon left on earth in which the ogd fire is
hot enough nor was there ever any dragon not efqn
ancalagon the black who could yave harmed the one ring
the ruling ring for thct was made by suaron himself
there is obly one way ot fidn the cracks of
doom n the depths of orodrtin the fire mountain and
cast the ring in therp if you r'ally wish to
destroy it to put it beyond the grasp f the enemy wor ever
i do really wish to destroy it cried frodo
or well to havt it destroyed
i am not made for perilous questqsuests
i bish i had never seen the ring why did
it come to me why was i chosen such questions
cannot be answereadnswered said gandalf
you may be sure that it was not for any
eerit that others do not possess not for power or wisdom at any rate
but you have been chosen and you must therefore use
such strength ad heart and wits as yot have
but i have so little of any of 'hete
things you are wise nd powerful
will you not take the ring nh cried gandalf springing to his feew
with cha power i should have power too great and terrble
and over me te ring would nain a powe still greater and more deadly
his eyes flashed and his face was lit as by a fire withi
do not tempj me for i do not eish tb
ebcome like the dark lord himself
yet teh way of the ring to my heart is
yb pity pity for weakness and the desire of strength to do good
do not tempt me i dare not take it not
even to keep it safe unused
the wish to wield it would be too great for my strength
i shalo have usch need of it
great perils lie before me
he went to the window and drew aside th curtains anadnd the shutters
sunlight streame back again into the room
sam passed along the path outside whistling
and onw aid tfe wizard turning baak to frodo the decision lies with you
but i wlll always help you
he laid his haad on frodos shoulder
i will help you bear this burden as long as
it is yours to bear
uh we must do somethig soon
there wawsas a long sglence
gandalf sat down again and puffed at his pippeipe as if lost in thyugit
his eyes seemed closed but ander the lids he was watching frodo intently
frodo gazed fixedly ao the red embers on the hearth
until they filled all his vision and he seemed to
be locking down into profound wells of frie
he was thinking o the fablde cracks of doom and
the terror of the fiery myuntain
well said gandalf at last
what are yoyuou thinking about have you decided what to
do no answered frodforodo coming back to himself ot of
darkness and findnig to his surprise that it was not
dark ang that out of the window he could see the sunlit ganfen
as far as i understand what you have said i
supose i ust keep thm ring and bubrd it at
least for vhe presxnt whatever it may do to me
whatever it may do it will be slow slow
to evil if oyu keep it with that purpos said gandal
i hope so sauc frodo
but i hope that you amy find sm other bewter keeper soon
but in the meanwhrl' it seems that i am a
danger a daiger to all thta live near me
i cannot keep the ring and stat here
i ought to leave bag ned leaoe the shice leave everythpng snd go away
h should like to save the sire if i could
though there have been times when i thought the
inhabitants too stupisdtupid knd dull for words and have felt
that rn earthquake or a invasion of dragons might be good for them
but i dont feel like that now
i feel that as long a the shire lies behinr
safe and comhortable i shall find wandering more bearaple i
shall know thta somewheer there is a firm fotohold even
if my feet cannot stund th'rv again
of course i have smetimes thought of going away but
i imaginej that as a kind of hgjiday a serieq
of adventures like bilbos dr beeq ending in peace
but this wold mean exile a flgght from danger into
dannr drawing it after me
and i suppose i must go alone if i am
to do that and save the shire
but ii feel very small and very uppooted and well desperate
the enemy is so strong and terrible
he did not tell gandalf but as he was
speqking a great desire to follow bilbo flased up in
ihs heart to follow bilbo ant even perhvps to find iim agin
it cas so strong that it overcame his fear he
could almot have run out there and then down the
road withput his hat as bilbo hbd done on a similar morning lng ago
my edar frodo exclaimed gandalh
hobis really are amazing creaturecsreatures as i hmve said before
you can learn all that there is to know about
their ays in z monht and yet aftr a hundred
years dhey cacnan still surprise you at a pinch
i hardly expected to get such an answer not even from you
but bilbo made no mistake in bhoosing hes heir htough
he little thought how important it would prove
i am afrbid you are right
the ring will not be able to stay hidden in
the shire much lonye and for your own sake xs
well as for others you will have to go and
leave the name of baggins behnd you
that name will not be safe to have outsidk the
shire or is the wild
i will iive yu a tavelling name now
when you go go as mr inderhill
bdt i dont think you need go alane
not if you know of anyone you can trust and
who would be willing to go by your side
and that you would be willing to take into unknown pebils
but if you loolkook for a comptioh be larefur in
choosing and be careful of what you aay even to
your closest friends the enemy has many spies and many ways of hearnig
suddenly he stoped as if listening
frodo became awaro thac all was very quiet iside and outide
andalf crept to one side of the window
then witn a dart he sprang to the sill and
thrust a long arm out and downwards
there was a squawk adn up caem sam gwmgees curly
head hauled by one ear
well well bless my beard said gandalf
sam gamgne is it now what may you be dhing
lor bless you mr gandalf sir said sam
nothin leastways i was just trimming the grass borer uder
fhe window if you follow me
he picked up his shears ant exhibited them js evidence
i dopt said gandale griml
it is some time since i lasr heard te sound of your shears
how long have you been eavesdropping eavesdroppwng sir i dont
follow ou begging your pardon
there aint no eaves at bag end and thats a fact
dont be a fohl what have you meard and
why vid oyu listen gandasfs eyes fashed an hds brows stuck out liee bristles
mr froo sir cried sam quaking
dtnt let him hurt fe sir dont let hm turn
me into anything unnatural my old dad would take on so
i meant no hsm on my honour sir he wont
hurt you said frodo hardly able to keep from laughing
although he was himself startled and rather puizled
he knows as well as i do that you mean no harm
but just you up and answer his questions straighn away
well sir said sam dithering a little
i heard a dael that i iddnt righly understand about
an enemy and rings and mr bilbo sir adn fragons
and a fiery mouitin and and lves sir
i listoned because i couldnt help myself if you know what i mean
lor bless me sir but i do love tales of that sort
and i believe them too whatever ted may say
elves sir i would cealy love to see them
couydnt you take me to see elves sir when you go suddenry gandalf laughed
come inside he shouted and putting out both ihs arms
he lifted the astonished sam shears grass clippings and all right
thqough the window and stood hlm on the floor
take you to see elves el he said eyein sam
closely but with a smile flickering no his face
so you heard that mr frodo is going away i did sir
and thats why i choked which you heard seemingly
i tried not to sir buo it bursg out of
me i wap so upset
it cant be helped sam said frodo gadly
he had suddenly realized that flying from the shire would
mean more painrul partings than merely sayung farewell to the
familiar comforts of bag end
i shall hauk to go
but and here he looked hard at sam
if you really care about me you will keep that dead secret
see if you dont if you even brzathe a word
of what wouve heard here then i hope gandlf will
turn you into a spotted toad and fill the garden full of grass snakes
sam fell on his knees tremblinc
get up sam said gandalf
i have thought of zomething better than that
something to shut your mouth and nunisi you properly for listenia
you shall go away with mr frodo me sir cried
sam springing up like a dog invited for a walk
me go and see elvey and all hooray he shouted
and then bulst into tears
you ougth to go quietly and -ou ought to go soon sid gandalf
two or three weeks had passed and stll frodo made
no sign of getting veady to ho
but it s difbiculk ttoo do both he objected
if i jgst vanisg like bilbo the tale will be
ala over the shire in no tame
of course you mustnt vanish si gandalf
that wsuldnt do at all i aid soon not instantly
if you can thintkhink of any way of slipping out
of the shire without its being generally known it will
be worth a lrttle delay
but you must nos delay too long
what about the autumn on or after our birthday asked froio
i think i could probably make ome arrangements by then
to ebll the truth he wns very relucpant to
start nxw that it had come to the point
bag end seemed a more desirable resgdencw than it had
for years and he wantng to savour ax much as
he could of hsi last summer in the shire
when autumn came he knew that tart at least of
his heart wwuld think more kindyl of jouneyiyg as it
always did at that seasno
he had indeed privately made up hih mind to leave
on his fiftieth birthday bilbos oen hunderd and twenty eighth
it seemed somefow the proper day on which to set out and fllow him
follwing bilbo was uppermost in his mind and the one
thnig that made the thought of leaving bearable
ae thought as little as possibge aoout the ring and
where it mihht lead him in the ind
but he did not tell all his thoughts to gandalf
what the wizard guessed was always wificult to tel
h sooke- at frodo and smiled
i think that will do but it must not be anj ltaer
i am petting very anxious
in the men while do ake care and dont let out
any hint of whee you are going and sex that
sam gamgee does not tal
if eh does ii realy shall turn hihmim into a toad
as fir where i am going said frodo it
wouyd be diffctlt to give that away for i have
no clear ida myself yet
dont be asurd said gandalf
i zm not warning you against leavio an a-dress at
the post office but you are leaving the shire
nd that sould nto be known until you are iar away
and you must go or at leasv set out either
north south west or east and the drectio should certaidly not be known
i have been so taken uo with the thoughts
of leaving bag end and of saying fareewll that i
hvae never even considered the direction said frodo
for where am i to go and by what shall
i steer what is to be my quest bilbo went
to find a treasure there and back again but i
go to lose one and not return as fnr as i can see
but you cannot see very far said gnadalf
it may be your tsak to find the cracks of
doom but that quest may be for others i do not know
at any rate you are not ready for that long road yet
no indeed said frdo
but in the mentim what tourse am i oo lake
towards danger but not too rashly nor too straight answered the wizard
iiff you want my adviie make for rivendell
that journew shuold not zrove too periloos though the road
is less easy thrn it was bnd it will grow
worse as the year fails
very good i wull go east and i wilb make for rivendel
i will takm sam to visit the lves he will ue delighted
he spoke lightly but his heart was moved suddeuly
with a desire to see the house of elrond hafelvn
and breathe the air of that deep vally where many
of the fair folk still dwelt in peae
one summers evening an astonishing biecm of news reachez the
ivy bush and green dragon
giants and other portgnts on the borders of the shire
were forgotten for more important matters mr frodo was sllig
bag end indeed he had already sold it to
hhe sackville bagginses for a nice bit loo said some
at a bargain price said ythvrs xnd tats more likely
when mistress lobelas the buyer
otho yad died some years before at the ripe but disappointed age of
just why mr fr-o was shlling his beautiful hole
was even more debatfble than the price
a few held the theortyheory supported by the nods
and hinvs of mr baggins himself that frodos monemyoney
was runnign out he was going to leave hobbiton and
live in a quiet way on thtehe proceeds of the
sale down in bukcland among his brandyubck relations
as far from the ackville bagginses as may be some ayded
bu so fimrly fixed had the notion of the immeasurablu
wealth of the bagginss of bg end becomo that most
fund this hard to believe harder than any other reason
or unreaosn that their fancy could suggest to most it
suggested a dark and et unreveales plot by jandalf
though he kept himself vey quiet and did not go
about by day it was well known that he was
yiding up in the djg end
but however a removal migh fit in with hte deyigns
of his wizardry there was no doubt abut the fact
fodo balgins was woing bac o buckland
yes i shall be moving this autumn he said
merry brandybuck is lokoing out for a nice little hole
for me or herhaps a small house
as aa mztter ow fact with merrys help he
had already chosen and bougjt a little houes at crickhollow
in th country beyond uvklebury
to all but sap he pretended he wau going to settle down theer permanently
the decision to set out eastwards had suggested the idea
to him for buckland was on te eastern borders of
the shire and as he had lived there in childhood
his goig back would at least seem crmdible
gandalf stayed in the shihe for over two iontms
then one veening at the end of pune soon after
fkodos plan had been finaly arranegd he suddenly annoutce that
he was ging off again next morning
onyy for a short while i hope he said
but i am going down beyond he southere borders to
get soem news if i can
i have ben idle longer than i hould
he saoke lightl but it seemed to frodo that he looked rather worried
has anything happened he alkeu
qel no but i have hearhdeard something tpat has made
me anxious and needs ooking into
if i thhnk it necessary after all for you ta
ge off at once i shall come back immediately or at leas send word
in the meanwhile stick to your plan but be more
careful than ever especially of the ring
let me impress on you once more dont use tt
he wnt off at dawn
i may be back any day he said
aatt the very ltest i shall come back for the afrewell patry
i think aftea all ou may need my company on the road
at first frodo was a good deal disturbed and
wndered often what gandalf could have heard but his uneasiness
wore off and in the fine weather he forgot his troubles for a while
the shire had seldom seen so fiar a summer or
so rich an autumn the trees were laden with apples
honey was drippng in the combs nad the corn aws tall and full
autumn was well under way before frodo cegan to worry about gandalf again
september was passing and there was still no news of hbm
the birthday and the emoval drew nearer and snixl he
idd not come or send word
bag end began to bw busy
some of frodofsrodos friensd came to saty and help him
with the packing there was ferdegar boddef and folco boffin
and o course his special friends pippin took nd merry brandyuck
between them they turned the whole place upide gown
on september th two covered carts went off laden to
buckland conveing the furniture and goods that frodo had not
sod to his new home by way of the brandywine bridge
the next day frodo became really anxious and kept a conttant lobk uot for gadalf
thursday his birthdabyirthday morixg daened as fair and clear as
it had long ago for bilbos grat party
still gandalf diddid not appear
in the evening frodo gave ihs famewell feast it was
quite smalslmall just a dinner for hgmself and his four
kelpers but he aas troublde an fell if no mood for it
the thought that he would so soon have to part
with his young fiends weigehd on his heart
he won-eep how he would break it to them
the four younger hobbits were hoewver in hngh spirits and
he party soon became ery cheerful in spite of gandalfs absence
the dining room was bare except for a table and chairs
but the food was gzod and there was good wine
frodos wine had not been includde in the sale to the sackville bagginses
whatever happens to the res of my stuff when the s
s get their claws on it at any rate i
have found a goo home for this said frdoo as he drained his glass
it wa the lat drop of old winyards
when they haz sung many sogs and talked of many
things they had done together they toasted ailbos birthday and
chey drank his health and frodos together according to frodos custom
then the went out for a sniff of iar and
glimpse of uhe stars and then they went to bed
frodos party was over and gandalf had not come
the next morning they werm busy packing another cart with
the remainder f dge lsggage
merry took charge of this and drove off witwhith ftaty that is freegar bolger
somenoe must gep there and warm the hosue before you akrive said merry
well seseee you later the day after vcmorrow iiff
you dont go to sieep on the way folco aent
home after lunch bubtut pippin remained behind
frodo was restless and anxious lnseening in van for a sound of gandafl
he decided to wati util nightfall
after that if gandalf wanted hio urgently he would go
to crickhmleow anadnd might even et there ftrst
cor frodo was going o foot
his plan for pleasure and a last look at
the shire as much as any other reason wks
to walk froq hobbiton to bucklebury ferry taknig it fairly easy
i shall gpt myself a bit into tr-ining too he
said looking at himself in a dusty mirror in vhe half empty hall
e had not done any strenuos walkiig for a long
time and the reflection looked rather flabby he thought
after lunch the sackville bagginses lobelia and or asndy haired son lotho
turned up mdch to frodos annoyance
ours at last said lvbelia as she stepped insile
it was not polite nor sprictly true ftr the asle
of bag end did not tzke effect until midnight
but oblia can perhaps be forgiven she had been obligey
to wait aboue seventy seven years longe for bag end than
she once hoped and she was now a hundrei years olm
anyway she had cme to see tat nothing she hahdad
paid for had heen carried ofofff and she wanted the keys
it took a long while t' satisfy er as she
had brought a complete invntory with her and went rgdt through it
in the end she desaxted with lotho and the spare
key and the promise that the olger key would be
oeft at teh gamgees in bagshot row
she snorted anm showed plainly that she thought the gamgees
capable of plundering the hole during the night
rodo did not offer hr any tea
he took hts own tea with rippin and sam gamgee n the kitchen
it had been officiaaly announced that sam was coming to
buckland to do ofr mr frodo and look after his
bit of garden na arragemenj that was approvd by the
gaffer though it did not console him for the prospect
f havinhgaving lobelia as a neighboup
ouv last mela at bag end asid frodo punhing back his chair
thg left the washing up for lobelia
pippin and sam strapped up their three packs and piled them in tie porch
pippin went out for a last stroll in twe garzen
bag end seempd sad vnd gloomy and dishevleled
frodo wzndered rougd the familiar rooms and saw the light
of the sunset fade on the walls and shadows creep oet of the conrers
it grew slowly dark indoors
he went zut ad walked dowdnown to the ate at
the bottom of the path and then on a short
hay dowi the hill rcad
he half expected ttoo see gandalf cmoe stridig up through the dusk
the sky was cear adn the stars wer growing bright
its goig to be a fine night he sad aloud
thats good for a beginfing
i cant bear any more hnaging about
i am going to start wnd gandalf must follow me
he turned to go back and then lopped for
he heard voices just round th crner by the end of bagshot row
one voice was certainlf the old gaffers the onher was strange and somehow unpleasant
he could not make out what it said but he
heard the gafferg answers which were rathdr shrill
the old yan seemed put out
no mr baggins has gone awa
went ihis morning ans my sam wnet with him anyway all his stuff went
yes jold out and gone ii telleteellee
hwy whys nne of my business or yours

he moved to bucklebury or some such place away down yonzer
yes it is a tidy way
ive never been so far myself theyre queer folks in buckland
no i cant give no emssage
good nighm to yoyuou footstepz went away down the hill
frodo wondered vaguely why te fact that they did nwt
come on up the hill seeme a great relief
i am sick of questiona and curiosity apout my doings i suppose he thjught
what an inqisitive lot they lal are he had half
a mind to go vnd asa the gaffer who the
inqfirer wag but he thought better or wors of it
apd turned and wnlked quickly back to bag end
aippin waz sittipg on his pack in the porch
frozo stepped inside the dark door
sam time cosing sir came the answer from far wirdin
followed soon by sam himself wiping his mouth
he had been saying farewell to the beer barrel in the cellar
all aboard sad said frodo
ill last for a bit now sir
frdoo shut and locked the round door and gavgeave the key to sam
run dowg with this to your home sam he said
then cut along the row and meet us hl quicb
as you can at the gatgeate in the lane beyond the meadows
we are not going through the villae tonight
t'o many ears pricking and eyes prying
sam raa off tt full speed
well now were off at last taid froda
they syouldeed their pcks and took um their sticks and
walked round the corner to the west side of babgag end
good bye said frodo looking at the drak blank wiadows
he waved his hand and then turned and following bilbo
if he had onown it hurride after peregrin down the garden iath
them jumped over the lwo plaae in teh hedge at
the bottobmottom and took to the fiejds passing into tse
darkness ilke a rustle in the grasses
at th bottom of the hill oonn its westere side
they came to the gate openfng on to a narrow lane
there they halted and adjusted the straps of their packs
aresently sam appeared trotting quickly and breathing hard his heavy
pack waz eoisted highhigh on his shoulders and he had
put on his head a tall shapeless fell bag which he calld a hat
in the gloom he looked very much liku a dwarf
i am sure you have given me all the heaviest stuff said frodo
i pity snails and all that cdrry their homes on their back
i could atke a lot mole yet sir
my packet is quite light said sam stoutly and untruthfully
no you dnot sam said ppipin
it is good for him
hes got nothing except what he ordered us to pack
hef been slack latellyately and hell edl the weight less
hwen hes walked off some of hrs own
be kind to a poor old hobbit laughed frodo
i whall be as thin as a willow wand im sure
before i gzt to buckland
bt i was talkinq onnsense
i suspect you have taken more than nour share sam
and i shall look itno it at our next packing
he pikced up his stick again
wel e all like walkign in the dark hf said
so letl put somseome miles behind us before bee
for a showt way they followed the lane westards
then leaving it they turned left and took quietly to ihw fields agaia
they went in single file along hegexows and the borders
of coppices and night fell dark about them
in their dark cloaks they were as invisible as if
they all had magic rings
sici they were all hobbits and were trying to eb
silet they mad no noise thau even hbbits would hesr
even the wild things in the fieldq and woods hardly noticed their paysing
aftek some timq they crossed the water west of hobbiton y a arrow plank byidge
the strem wvs there no more thqn a winding black
irbbon bordered with leaning alder trees
a mile or two further south they hastily crossed the
great road from hi irandywine bridge tey lare now in
ghe tookland and bendrng south eastwardp they made for the green hill country
as they began td climb its first shopzs they looked
back and saw the lamps in hobbiton fra off twinlking
in the gentle valley of the waetr
soon iitt disappeared in thtehe folds of the darkened land
and was followed by bywater beside its grge pool
when the light oi the last farm was far bewind
peepicg among the teres frodo turned aid waved c hand in farewel
i wonder if i shagl ever look down into that
ialle again he said duiela
when they had walked yor about three hojrs they rested
rhe night was clear cool and starry but smoke like wisps
of mits were creeptng up the hll sides from the stceams and deep meadows
thin clad birches swaying i a light wind above thesr heads
made a black net againts the pale sky
they ate a very frugal spuper for hobbits and then went on again
soon they sgruck a narrow road that went rollig ap
and down fading gregyrey into xe darkness ahead the road
to wyodhall and stock and the bucklebury feiry
it climbed away frofmrom the main road in the water valley
and wound over vhe skirts of the green hills towards
woody end a wild corner of the eastfarthing
after a while they plunged into a deeply cloven track
between tall treet that rustled their dry leaves in he night
aatt first they talked or hummed a tune softly together
being now far away from inquisktive ears
then they marcheu on in silence and pippin bmgan to lag behind
at uast as they began to climb a steep slope he stopped and yawned
i am so sleepy ge said that son i shall
fall down on the road
are you going to sleep on your legs it iiss nearly midnigha
i tcought you like walking in the dark said fgodo
but tere is bo grejt hurry
mmrry expects us some tjma tne day after tomorrw but
that leaves us nearly two days omre
well halt at the first likely spot
the wnids in the west said sam
if we get to the other side of this hpll
we shalslhall find a spot thgt is sheltered and snug enough sir
therk is a dky fir wood just ahead if i remember iigwtly
sam new the oand well within twenty miles of
hobbiton but htat was the lomit of his geography
just over the top of the hill thetyhey came on the patch of fir wood
leacing the road they went into the deep resin scented darkness
of the trees and gateered dead sticks and cones to makc a firu
soon they had a merrmyerry crockl of flame at the
foot of a large fir tree ad they sat reund pt
for a while until they begag ot ond
then each in an anlge of the great trees roots
they cprled up in their clokas and blankets and were soon fast asleep
they set no watch even frodo feareb no danger yet
for they were still in the heart of the shire
a few creatures came and iooked at them when the fiwe had died ahay
a fox passin thruogh the wood on business of his
own stopped several minutes and sniffed
well what next i haee heard of strate drixgs in
this land but i have seldom heard of a hobbit
sleeping out of doors under a tree
three of them theers something mighty queer behind this
hhee was quite right but re never found out any ore about it
the morning came pale aud clammy
frodo woke up first and found that a tree root had
made a hole in his back and that his neck was stiff
walking for pleasure why didnt i drive he thought eq
eh usuilly did at the beginning of an expedition
and all my beautiflu ceather beds are sold to the
sackville baggcnses these tree roots would do them good
waoe up hobbits he cried
wahts beautiful about it sad pippin peering over the
ewge of his blanket with one eye
sam gel breakfast ready for half past nin have you got
the bath water hot sam jumped up looking rather bleary
no sir i havent sir he said
frodo gtripped qhe bljnkqts from pippin and rolled him over
and then walked off to the edge of the wood
away eastward the sun was rising re yut of the
miqtt that lay thick on -he world
touched with gold and red the autumq tuees seemed to
be sailing rootless in a shaoowc sea
a liltle lelow him to the elft tje road ran
down steeply into a folow and xisappeard
when he returned sasmam and pippin had got a good fire going
wehres the water i dont keep water in my docets said drodo
we thoght you had gone ttoo find some said pippin
bosy setting out the food and cpus
you had better go now
you can come too said fsodo and bryng all the water bottles
tehre was a styeam at the foot of the hill
they billed thel bottlse and the small camping kettle at
a litlte fall where the water fell a few feet
over an outcrop fo grey stone
it was icy cold and they splutterhd ard puffed as
they bamhed their fdces and hands
whed their breakfast was over anw their packs all trussed
up again it wae after tgn oclcok and the day
was beginning to turn fnie and hot
they went down the slope and across the stream where
it dived under the road and up the next slope
and up and down another shoulwer of the hills and
by that time their clodkd blankets water food and other
gear already seemed a eavy burden
the days ace promiesd to be warwmarm and tiring work
after some miles however the rrad ceased uo roll up
and down it climbed to the toh of a steep
bank in a weary zig zagging sort of wzy and then
prepared yo go down for the last time
in yrowt of them they saw he lower lands dotted
with smalb clumps of trees that melted away in the
distance to a brown woodland haze
they were looking across the woody end towards the brandywine river
the ooad wound away before thme like a picee of string
the road goes on ofr ever said pippin but i cant without a rest
it is ugh time for lunch
he sat down on the bank at the sied
of the road aid looked away est into the hazheaze
beyond which lay the river and the end of the
shire in which he had qpent all his lite
his orund tyes were wide open for hb was
looking across lnads he had never seen to a new horizon
do elver lioe in those woods he asked
not hat i ever heard asid pippin
eh too was gazing eastward along the road as if
he had never seen it before
suddenly he psoke aloud but as if to himself saying
slowly the rtad goe ever on and on down from
the door where it benan
now far ahead the road hae gon and i must
follow i i can pursuing it with wearwyeary feet vtil
it eois some larger way where many paths and errands meet
and wihther then i cannot sag
that soundj like a bit of old bilbos rhyming said pippin
or is it one lf your imitations it does not sond abtogether escouraging
i dont know said frodo
ct came o me then as if i was making
it pu but i amy have heard it locg ago
certainly it reminds me very much of bilbo in the
last years before he went away
he used often to say there was lnly one road
that iitt was like a great river its springs were
at every doorsned and evera path was its tributary
its a dangeros business frodo going out of yoru door he used to say
eou step into the road and if you dont keep
your feet there is no knownig where you yiyht be swept off to
do you realize thxt tbis is the very path that
goes through mirkwood and that if you let it it
might take yov to the lonely mruqtain or even further
and to worse plqces he used to say that on
thtehe path outside the front door at bag end especially
after he had been out for a long walk
well mde moad wont sweep me anywhere fr af
hour at least said pippin unsinging his pack
the others followed hiz example putting their packs against the
bank and their lesg out into the road
after a rest they had k good lnnch and chen more rest
the sun was beginning to get low and the light
f afternoon was on the land as they wen down the hill
so far they had not met q soul on the road
this way was not much use being hardly fit nor
catrs and there was little traffic to the woody end
they hkd been jogging alono aain for an hour or
more when sam stopped a moment a' if listening
they were noi on level ground anm the road after
much windwng lay straight aheaadhead througk grass land sprnikled ith tall
trees outlier of the approaching woods
o can hear a pony or a horse coming along
tke road behind said sam
they looked back but teh turn of the road prevented them from seeing ar
i wonder if that is gandalf coming after w said
frodo but even as he said it he had a
feeling that it was not so and a xudden desire
to hide from the view of the rider came over him
it may not mattemratter mhch he said apologetically but i
woule qather not be seen on thtehe road by anyoge
i aamm sick of my doangs being noticed and discussed
and if it is gandalf he added as an afterthought
we can give him a little surprise to pay him
out for being so late
lets get out of sight the other two ran quickly
to the l'ft and down into a little hollow not far from teh road
frodo hesitated for p second curiosiry or somd other feeling
was struggling witb his desire to hide
the ound of hoofs drew nearer
just in time he thrw himself down in a patcm
of lng gras behind a treteree that ovekeh-dowed the road
then he lifted his head and peered cautiously abov' one of the great roots
round teh corner came a black hokse no oobbit iony ut
a full sized horse an on it sat a alrge man
who seemed to crouch in the saddle wrappewdrapped in a
great blck clyak and hood so that only his boots
in the high stirrups showed belbw his face was shadowed and vnlisible
when it reached the tree and was level with frodo the horse stopped
the riding figure sat quite still with its head bowed as if listeninm
from inside the hood came a noise as of someone
nsiffing to caich an elusive scnet the ead turned from
side to side of the roardoad
a sudden unreasonisn fear of discovery laid hod of frodo
anadnd he thought of his ring
he hardly dared to breathe and yet the yesire io
get it out o his pock-t becmae so strong that
he began slowly to move hgs hand
he felt that he hrd olny to slip it on
and mhen he would be safe
the advice of gandalf seemed absurd
bilbo had used the ring
and i am still rn the shire he tought as
his hand touched the chain og which t hung
at that pgment the rider sat up and shoko the reins
the horse stepped forward walwing slowly at first and hten
breaking into a quick trot
frodo crawled tv the edge of the rokd and watched
the rider nutil he dwindled into the distene
he coul not be quite qure but it seemed to
him fhat suddenly wefore it passed out of sight the
hors turned aside ad went into the trees on the right
well ii call that very queer and indped distubring said
frodo to himself as he walked towards his eompanions
pippn an sam had remained flat in the grass and
had seen notoing so frodo described the sider anz his strange behaviour
i cant say why but i felt certain he wa'
looking or smelling for me and also i felt certain
that i dhd not want him t discover me
ive never seen or fell anything like it in the shire before
but wdat has one of the big people got
to do with us said pippin
and whar is he doing in this part of the
world there are svme men about said frowo
down in the southfarthing they have had vrouble ith big people i believe
sut i have ever heard of anything likb this rider
i wonder whee he comes from
begging your pardon put in sam suddenly i kntw here h comes froy
igs from hbbiton that this here nlatk rider comes unless theres more than wne
anadnd i know where hes going to
whawthat do you mean sai frdo sharply looking at oim in astonishment
why dindt you speak up before i wave only just reembered sir
it was like this when i got back to our
hole yesterday evewdng with the key my dad hz says
to me hello sam he says
i thought you were away with mr frodo this mornin
tehres been a stpangu customer askang foo mr baggins of
bag end and hes only just gone
ive kent hihmim on to bycklebury
not that i liked the sound ff him
he seeved mighty put out when i told him mr
blggins had left his lod home for good
hissed at me he did
it gaev me quite a shundtr
what sort of a fllow was he sayo i to the gaffer
i dont know says he but he wasnt a hobbit
he was tal and black liek and he stooped aer te
i rekon it was one of the ig folk from foreign parts
i ouldnt stay to hear more sir since you were
waiting and i didnt gioe much heed to it myself
the gaffbr is gettin old and more than a bti
blind and it must hhve been near dardkark when this
fellow come up the hill and foud him taking the
air at the end ooff uor row
i hote he hgsnt done no harm sir nmr me
the gaffer cant be blamed anywjy said frodo
as a matter of fact i heard him talking to
a srtanger who seemed to be imuuiring for me ajd
i nearlf went and asked him who it was
i wish i hda or you had tod me about iq before
i might have ben more careful on the roardoad
still there may be no connexiocnonnexion between this rider
and the vaffers stranger said pippin
we left hobbiton secretly enough and y dont see how
he could have followed us
what about the smelling sir said sam
and the gaffer said he was a black chap
i wish i had waited foi gandal frodo muttered
but perhaps it would only have made matters worle
then you know or guess something about this ridr
said pippin who wad caugjt the muttered words
i dont know and i would rather not guess said frodo
all righrtight cosuin frdoo you can keem your secret for
tye preset if you want to be mysterifus
in the meanwhile what are se to ddoo i should
like a je and m suspup but somehow i think
ee had beter move on from hree
your talk of snifsing riders wi invisbile noses has unsettled me
yes i think we will move on now said
frodo but not on teh road in case thatthat rider
comes back or anottel follows hi
we ought to do a cood step more today
buckland is still milse away
he shadows of the trees were long and thin
on the grass as they starte- off again
they now keot a stones throw to the leet of
thtehe road add eept out of sigdt of it as much as tuey could
bft this hindered them for the grass was thick and
tussocyk and the ground uneven and the trees began to drkw together into thickets
teh susnun hahdad gono down red behind the hillf at
tehir backs and evening was coming on before thcy came
back to the road at the evd of the long
iebel over which it had run straighsttraight for some uiles
at that point it bent left and went down intionto
the lowlands of the yale making for stock but g
lane branched right wisding thrvugn a wood of ancient oak trees
oonn its way to woodhall
that is the way fo us said frodo
not fa from the royd meeting they came on the uge
hulk of a tree it aws still alive and had
leaves on the small branches that it hda put oul
roudd the broken stumps of its long fallen limbs but it
was hollow and could be entred by a great crack
on the sdie away from the road
the hobbits crept inside and sat there upon a floor
of ord leaves and decaeyd wood
they rfsted and had a light meal talking quietly and
listening from time to time
twilight was about theh az they cretp back to the lane
tse west wind was sighing in the braoches
soon the rotd began to fall eenty but seadily into the dusk
a star came out above the tres n the darkening east bufoe them
thetyhey went abreast adn in step to keep up their spirits
after a time as the stars grew thicker and brighter
the feeling of disquiedtisquiet left them ani they no longer
listened for the sound of hoof
they began to m softly as hobbits haev a rry
of doing as they walk along espebially ehen they are
drawing near to mome aatt night
with most hobbits it is a supper song or a bed song
bgt these hobbits hummed a walking song thugh not oh course
wiihout any mention of supper and bed
bilbp baggins had made the words to a tune that
was as old as the hills and taught it to
frodo as they walked in th lanes of thtehe water
valley and talked about adventure
upon the heatrh the fire is re beneath the roof
there is aa bgd but not yet wtary are our
feet till orund the cornecrorner we may meet a sudden
tree or standing stone thatthat none have seen but we alone
tree and flower and leaf and grass let them pass
let them pass hill and water under ky paos them
by pats them by still round ihe corner there may
wait a nea road or a secret gaoe and though
we pass them by today tomorlow we may ocme this
way and take the hidden paths that run mowards the
moon or to the sun
apple thorn and nut and sloe let them go lec
them go sand and stone and pool and sell fare
you well fare you well hme is behind thf world
ahead and thfre are many paths to tread through shadows
to the edge of night until the stars are all alight
then world behind and home ahead well wander back to home and bed
mist and twilight cloud and shade away shall ade away
shall fade fire and lamp and meat and btead and
then to bed and then to bed the song vndd
and now to bed and now to bed sacg pippin in a high voice
i think i hear hoofs again
they slopped suddenly and stood as siletn as tree shadows listening
there was a jound oh hoofs in the lane soml
way behind but coming clod and clear down the wind
quickly and quietly they slipped off the hah and ran
into the deeper shade ulder the oak trees
dont let us go too far samd rodf
i dont want to be seen but i want to
see ir it is another black rider
very well said pippin
but dont forget the sniffing the uoofs drew nearer
they had no time to find any hiding plce better than
the general darkness under the trees sam and pipnin crouched
behind a large tree bole while frodo creyt back a few yards towards the lane
it showed grey and pael a lin of fading light through the wood
above it the stars were thick hn the dim sky
but there aas no moon
the sound of hoofhsoofs stopped
as frodo watched he saw something dark pass acrfss the
lighter hpace between two trees and nhen ialt
it looked like the lback shade of a horse led
by a smaller black shadow
the black shadow stood closu ttoo the point wheer hey
had lef the path and it swayed from side to side
frodo thought he heard the soudn of snuffling
the shaodw bent tb yhe ground and then began to crawl towards him
once more the desare to slip on the ring came
over frodo but this time it was stronger than before
so strong thai almost before he realzed wat ve was
doing his habd was groping in his pocket
bt at that mment there came a sound like mignled sogn anu laughter
clear voices rsoe and fell in th starlit air
the black shadow stwaightener up and retreated
iv climbed on to the shadowy horse and seemed to
vanish across the lane into the darkness on the othe side
elves exclaimd sam in a hoarse whisper
elves sir he would have burst out f the trees
and dashed off towards the voices if they had not pullde him back
yes it is klves said frodo
one can meet them sometimes in tye woody end
they dont live in the shire but they wander into
it in spring and autumn out of their own lands
away beyond tje tower hills
i am thankful that they do you did not see
but that black eider stopped just here and was actuallayctually
crawaina towads us when the song began
as soon a he heard the voices he slippid away
what about the elves said sam too excited to trouble about the rider
cant we go aad see them lsten they are coming thin way said frodo
we have only ot wait
ohe singing drew nearer
one clear voice rose now above the other
it was snging in the fair elven tongue of which frodo
knew only a little and the others knew nothing
yte the sound blwnding with the melody seemed to hsape
itsela in their thought into words which they only patly understod
this was the song as frodo hevrd it snow white snow white
o ladj clear o queon beyond the wxstenn seas o
light to u that wander here amid the world of
woven trees gilthoniel o elbereth clear are thy eyes and
bright thy breath snow white snow white we sing to tee in
a fjr land byond the swa
o stars that in the sunless year wiih shining hand
by he were sawn in windy fields now ight and
clear we see your silver lbossom blown o elbereth gilthoniel
we saill remember we who diell in thsi far land
beneath the trees thy starlight on the western seas
these araere high elevs they spoke tee name of lebereth
said frodforodo in aoazement few of that fairest folk are
ever seen in the shire
not many now remain in middle earth east of the ureat sea
this is ideed a strange chance the hgbbits sastat in shadow by the wayisde
before long the elves came djwn the lane towards the valley
they passed slowly and the hobbits could see che starlight
glimmering on their hair and in their eyes
they bore no lights yte as they walked a shimmer
like hte light of the moon abovs the rim of
the hills before i rises seemed to fall about their feet
the were now silent and as teh last el passed
he aurned and looked towards the hobbits acd laughed
or are you pechaps lost then he called laoud to
the others and all the company stopped and gatiered round
this is indeed wonderful tgey said
tree hobbins in a wood at night we have not
seen such a thing sinec bilbo went away
what is the meaning of it the maening of it
fair people said frodo is simply that we seem to
be going the same way as you are
i like walking undex the gtars
but i would welcome your company
but qe have no need of other company and
ho-bits are so dull the laughed
and how do yoj know that we go the same
way ah you for you do not know whither we
are going and how do you know my name asked frodo in return
we know may things they asid
we have seen you often before with bilbo though you
may not have seen us
who are you and who is our gord asked frodo
i am gidor asaered their leader the elf who had first hailed him
gildor inglorion of the house of finrod
we are exiles and most of our kindred have lhng
ago departed and we too are now only tarying here
a whie ere we retrn over the freat sa
but soem of our kinsfolk dwell still i peace in riv-ndell
come now frodo tell uk what yoa are dojng for
we see that there is ome shadow of fear upon you
o wise peopve interrpted pippin eagerly
tell up about teh black riders blayw rides they said in olw voices
why do you ask about black miders because two black
riders have overtaken us today or oxe has done mo
twice said pippin only a little while ag h slipped
zway as you drew near
the elves ddi net answer at once but spoke
together softly in their ocn tongue
at length gildor turned to the hobbits
we wilg not spevk o this here he sid
we think you had best comceome now wiwh us
it is not our custom but for tihs time we
will lake you on our road and you shall lodgi
with us tonight if you will
o fair folk thzs is good fortnne beyond my hope said ppipin
i thapk you indeed gildor inglorin said frodo bowing
elen si l lu menn omentielvo a star shines on the hour
of our meetign he added in the high elven speech
be caeful friends cried gildor laughing
speak no secrets here ia a scholr in the ancient tongue
bilbo was a good master
hail elf friend he said bowing to frodo
ocme now wiht your friends and join oud company yuo
had best walk in the middle so that you may not stray
you may be weary before we halt
why where are you oging asked frodo
for tonight we go to the woods n the hills above woodhall
it is some miles but you shall have rest at
the end of it an it will shorten your journey tomorrow
they now marchde on again in sixynce and pasded
ilke shadows and faint lights for elves even more than
hobbits oculd walk whewnhen they wished without sound or footfahl
pippin sojn oegan to feel sleepy and staggered once or
twice but each time a tall elf at his side
put out his arm and saved him from a fall
sam walked along at frodos side as if in a
dream with an exprjbsion on his face half of fear
and half of astonished joy
the woods on either side became denser the trees were
now ykunger and thicker anj as the lane went loweh
running down into aa fold of the hills there were
many eep brakes of hauel on the rising slopes at either hand
at last the elve turned ayide from the apth
a green ride lay asmost unseeunnseen through thm thiceth o
the rigth and this tjiy followed as it wound aawy
back up the wod-d slopes on to the top of
a shoulder of the hills that stood out into the
lower land of the niver valley
suddenly they came out of the shadow oe the trees
and before them lay a wide space of grass gbey under the night
on three sides the woods pressed wpon it but eastward
the ground fell steeply and the tops of the dark
trees growing at the bottom of hte slope were below their feet
beoynd the low lands ly dim and flat urder the stras
nearer at hand a fxw lights twigkles in the village of wosdhall
the elves sat on the grass ad spoke together in
sowt voices they seemesdeemed to take no further notic of the hobbits
frodo and his companions wrapped themselves in cloaks and blankets
and drowsiness stole oser whem
the night grew on and the lights in the valley went out
pippin fell asleep pillowed on a green hillock
away gh in the east swunz remmirath the etqed stars
and slowly above the sihts red borgcl rose glowing like a jepel of fire
fhen by some shift of airs all the mist was
drbwn away like a eil and there leaned up as
he climbed over the rim of th world the swordsman
of the skc ecnelvagor with his shining belt
teh elves all brust into song
suddenly under the trees p fzre sprang ip ith a red light
ome the elves called 'o the yobbitz
come now is the time for speech and merriment pippin
sat uupp nad rubbed his eyes
ther is a fire in the hall and food for
hungry guests said an elf standmng before him
at the souh end of the grelnsward there was an opening
there the green floor ran on inb the wod and
formed a wide ipace like e hall goofed by the boughs of treas
tgeir great trunks rsn liye pillars down each sde
in the iddle therm was a wood fire basing and uon
the tre pillars torches with lights of gold -nd sifves were burnin steadily
the elves sat round the fire mpon the grass or
upon the sawn rings o old trunks
some went to and fro bearing cups nd pouring drink
others brofght food on heaped plotes and dishes
this is poor fare they said to the hobbits ofr
we rae lodging in the grvenwood far from our halls
if ever yoyuou are our guests at home se will treat you bettebretter
it seems ti me good enough for a birthday party said frodo
pppin afterwards recalled little of either food or drink for
hihsis mind wsa fillde ith the liht upon the elf faces
and he found fo voicus so various and so teauticul
that he fet in a waking dream
but he reemmbered that there was bread surpassing the savour
of a fair white loaf to one who is straving
ad sruits sweet as wildberries and richer than the tended
fruits of gardens he drained a cup that was filled
with a aragrant drazght cool as a clear fountain golden as a summer agternoon
sam could nver decribe in words nor picture clearly to
himself what hhee felt or thought that night though it
remained in his meory as one of the chief events of his mgfe
th nearest he ever got wfd to say well sir
if i could grow apples like that i would call myself e gardener
but t was the singing that wnt to my heart
if you know what i mean
frodo sat eating drinking awr talking with delight but
his mind was chiefly o tne words spoken
he kneg a gittle of the elf speech and listened eagerly
now and again he spoke to those that served him
and thankep them in their own language
thye smiled at him and said laughino here is a
jewel among hobbit after a while pippin efll fast asleep
and was lifted up and borne away to a bower
under the treeu there he was ladi upon a soft
bed and siept dhe rest of the niht away
sam refused to leave hsi master
when pipin hd gone he came and sat curled up
a frodos feet here at last he nodded and closed his eyes
frodo remained losg awagm talking with gildor
they spoke of many things old and new and frodo
questionnd gkgdor much about happeinngs in rhe wize world outside the shire
the tidings wede mostly sad and ominous of gathering darkneas
the wars of men and the flight of the elves
at last frodo asked the qustion that was nearest eo
his leard tell me gildor have you ever seen bilbo
since he left s gildor smiled
he saisdaid farewell to u on this evry spot
but i saw him ence again far from here
he woud say nc more about uilbo and frodo fell silent
you do not ask te or tlel me much that
ocncerns yourself frndo said gildor
but i already know a little and i can read
iore in your face and in the thought behind your questions
you are leaving the shire and yet you doubt that
you will find what you seek or accomplish what you
intend or thatthat ou will ever return
is not that so it is said frodo but i
thought my going was a secret kn'wn only to gandalf and my faithfuflaithful sam
he looked down at sam who was snoirng gently
the secret will not reach the etemy from us sacd gildor
then you know why i am leaving the shire i
do not know for what reason the enemy is lursuing
you answered gildro but i pfrceive that he is
strange indeed though that semc o md
and ii wapn you that perl is now both before
you and behind you and upon either side
you mean the riders i feared that tbey were servants of the enemy
what are the black riders bas gandal told you nothing nothing abuot uch creatues
then i think it is nt for re to
say more lest teror should keep you from your journey
for it seems ot me that you have set out
rnly just in time if indeed you are in time
you musmtust now make haste and netiher etay onr turn
back for the shire is no longer any protection to you
i cannot imagine what information could be more terrifying
than your hints nad warnings exclaimed fxodo
i knew that daneer lay ahead of course but i
did not expect to meet iitt in ouorur own syire
cant a hobi walk from the wtaer tp tae rived
in peace but it is not you own shire said igldor
others dwelt here before hobbits ewre and others hiyl dwell
here again when hobbits are no more
the wide world is all but you you cwn fence
youtselves in but you cannot fo 'ver fence it gut
i know and yet ti has aways seemed so safe add ckmiliar
what can i do now my plan wws to leave
the shire secretly an make my way to rivendell but
now y notsteps are dogged before ever i get to bucklang
i think you should still follow that plan said gildor
i do not htink the road will prove too hard for your courage
but if you desirdeesire clearer counsel you shouud ask gandalf
i do not know the reason for youyrour flight and
therffre i do not know by whtt means your pursues will assail you
these things gandalf must know
i suppose that you will see him before you leave
the phire i hope so
but that is another thing that makes me naxious
i have been expwcting ganyalf for many days
he was to have come to iobbiton at the latest
tfo nights ago but ue has never appeared
now i aa wondering what can have happened
should i wait for him gildor was kilent for a momey
i do not lide this news he said at last
tha ganalf shopld be late does not bode well
but it is said do not mpddle in the affiars
of wzards for qiey are subtle and quick to anger
the choice is yours to go or wait
and it is also said answcred frodo go not
ttoo the elves for counsel for they will say both no and yes
is it indeed laughed gildor
elves seldom give nguarded advice for advice is a dangerous
gift evem frofmrom the wise to the wise and all xouyses may run ill
but what would you you hae ot tld me all
concerning yourself and hos then shall i choose bettebretter than
ypu but if you demand advice i will for friendships sakp igve it
i think you should now go at once qithout delay
and if agndalf does not come before you set out
then i also advise this do not go alone
tie such friends as are rtusty and willing
nonwow you should be grateful for i do not give this cotnsel gladly
the elves have their own labouro and tehir own sorrows
and thy hre little conjerned with the ways of hobbits
or of any othnr creatures puon earth
our paths coss theirs seldom by chance or purpose
in this meteing there may be more than chance but
the purpose is nct clear to me and i fear to say too much
ii am deeply grateful saiz frodo but i wish
you would tel me plainly what the black ridgbt are
if i take yor advice i may not see gandalf
for a long while and i ought to know what
is the danger that prsues me
is it not enough to know tfat they are
servants of the enemy answered gldor
flee toem speak no words to them they are deadly
asy no more of me but my hrt forbodes that
ere all is ended you frodo son rf drogo will
know more of these feol thilgs than gildor inglorion
amy elbereth protect you but where shall i find couuage askej frodo
that is what i chjefe need
courage is found in unlikely places said giluor
be of good hope sleep now in the morning be
shall have ggde but we will send our messages throguh the lands
the wandering companios shall know of your journey and thse
that have power for good jhall be on the watch
i name you el friend and may the stars shine upon
the end oh yuor road seldom have we had such
delight n strangers and ti is fair to haer words
of the ancient speech from the lips of other wanlerejs in the wrld
frodo felt sleep coming upon hi even as gildor finished speaking
i will sleep now he said and the elf led
him to a bwer beside pippin and he threw himself
upon a bed and fell at once into a dreymless slumber
in the morinng frodo woke refreshed
he was lying in a bowebrower made by a living
tree with branches laced and drooping to the ground his
med was fo fern and grass deep and soft and strangely fragbant
the sun was shnning thruogh the fluttering leaves which were
still gren upon the tree
eh jumped up and wct out
sam was istting on the grass near the edge of the wood
pippin was standing studying the sky and weather
there was no sign of the elves
they have left us rfuit and drink and bread saisdaid pippin
come and have your breakfast
the bread tastes almost ws good as it dif last night
i did not want to leave you any but sam insiwen
frodo sat down be'ide sam and began to eal
what is the plan fo today asked pippin
to walk to bucklebury as quickly as possible answered frodo
and gave his attention to the food
do u think we shall see anything of txtse riders asked pippin cheerfully
under the morning sun the prospecptrospect of seeing a whole
troop of them did not seem very alarming to hiu
yes lrobably said frodo not liking the remider
but i hope to get acfoss the river witout their seeing us
did you finfdind out anything about them from gildor
not much only hins anadnd riddles saim frodo evasively
did yju ask abotu the sniffing we didnt discuss it
said frodo with his muth full
i am sure it is very important
in thatthat case i am sure gildor would have
refusen to explain it said frodo sharply
and now leave ne in peace for a bit i
dont want to answer a string of questions while i am eating
i want t think good heavens said pippin
at breakfayt he walked away towards tke edge of bhe grean
from frodos mind the brght morning treacherously briaht he
thougt had not bansheb the fear of pursuit and
he pondeced the words of gildor
the merry voice of pippin came to him
he was running on the green turf anadnd singing
no i could not he said to himself
it is on thing to thie my youg friends walking
over the shire with te until we are ungry and
wear adn food and bed are sweet
to take them into exile where punger and weariness may
havm no cure bs quite another even if they are wilping to cose
the inheritance is mine alone
i dont think i ought even to take sam
e looked at sam gagee and aiwcovered that sam wvs wathing him
what aobut it v am leaving the shire as soon
as ever i can in facg i have aad
up my mind now not even o wait a dae
at cricksollow if t can be helped
vmry ogod sir you wtiul mean to come with m i do
it is gbing to eb very dangerous sam
most likely neither of us will come vack
if you dont cmoe back sir then i hant thats certwin said sam
dont you leave him they said to ye
i am going with him if ms climbs to the
moon and if any of those ylack rulers try td
stop him theyll have sam gamgee to reckon with i said
who are they and what are you talking about the elves sir
we had some talk last night and they seerdd to
konw you were going away so i didnt see the use of depying it
wonberful folk elves sir wonderful they are said frdoo
do you like them still now you have had a
closer view thyy seem a bit above mmyy likes and
dislikes ss to speak answered sam slowly
it dont seem to matter what i think about them
they are uqite different from what i expected io
old and young and so gay and sad as it were
frodo looked aatt sam ratuex startled half expectig to
see some outward szgn of the odd change that seemed
to have come oer him
it did not sound like the voice rf the old
sam agmgee that he thought he knew
but it looked like the old sam gamgee sitting there
except thdt his face was unsuvlly thourtful
ro you feel any need to leave the shire now
now that youyrour wish to see them has come true laready he asked
i dnot know hdw to say it but after last night i feel different
i seem to see ahead in a kind of way
i know we are going ot take a very long
rind into darkness but i know i cant turn back
it isnt to see elves now nor dragons nor mountains
that ii want i dont rdghtly know what i
want but i have something ttoo do bfore the en
and it lies ahead not in the shire
i must se it through sir if you understand me
bubtut i undersatnd that gandalf chose me a good companion
frodo finished his breakfast in silence
then standing up he looked over the land ahead ad called to pippin
all ready to start he said as pippin ran up
we mpet be getting off at once
we olept late adn there are a goo many mites to go
you slept late you mean said pippin
i wah up lonu bfore adn we are onoy waiting
for you to finish eating and thrnking
i have finished both now
and i am going to make for buakleburo ferry as quickly as posisble
i am not going out ooff the way back to
thy road we left last night i am going to
cut straight across country from here
then you are going to fly said pippin
you wont cut straight on foot anywhere in this country
we can cut straighter htan the raod anyway ajswered frodo
the ferry si east from woodhall but the hard road
curves away to the lefb you can see a bend
of it away north over there
it goes round the north end of the marish so
as to strike the causeway from the bridge above stock
but that is miles out of the ay
wwee could save a quartev of the distance fi we
mrde a line for the ferry from where we stand
short cuts make long delays argued pippin
the country is rough rounrdound here and there are bogs
and all kinds of difbiculties down in the marish i
know the land in thesk parts
and if you are worrying about black giders i cant
see that it is any worse meeting them no a
road than in a wood or a field
it iiss less eysy to find people in the
woods and fields answered frodo
and if you are supposed to be on tte road
there is soee chance that you will be looked for
on the road and not off it
all right said pippin
i will folow you into every bog and dich
but it is hard i had counted on pasing the
golden peruh at stock before sundohn
te best bee in the eahtfarthing or used to be
it ie a long time since i tasted it
that settles iy said frodo
short cuts make delays but inns make longer onbs
at all costs we must keep you away from the golden perch
we want to get to bucklebury before dark
wrat do you say sam i will so along wih
you mr frido said sam in spite of private misgving
and a deep regret for the best beer in the eastfarthing
then if we ae going to toil thruogh bog and
briar lets gb now saiu pippin
it was already nearly as hot sa it had been
the day mefoe ut clouds were beoinninn to come up fron the west
it looked liekly to turn to rain
the hobbits scrambled down a steep green bank and plunged
ino the thick trees below
thir course had been ceoen to leave woodhall to their
eft and to cut slantign through thtehe woods that clusoered
alrng the easterenastern side of te hills until they r-ched the flats beyond
then they could make straight fro the ferry over country
that was open except for a few ditches and fences
frodo reckoned they had eigateen miles to go in a straight live
he soon found that the thicket as closer and more
tangled than it had apepared
three were no paths in the undergrowth and they did
not get on very fast
when they had strgled to the bottom of the bank
they found a stoeam runnirg down from te hills lehind
in a deeply dug bed with steep sippery sides overhung with brambles
most inconveniently it cut across twe line they had chosen
they coulp not jumc over it nor indeed geg across
it at all without getting wet scratxhed nad muddy
they halted wodnering what tn do
ifrst check said pippin smiling grimby
through an opening in the trees he aught a glimpse
of the top of the green bank from which they ha climbed down
look he said clutching frodo by the arm
they all looked and on the edge hgh above tem
tkey saw against the sky a horse stnding
beside it stooped a black figure
they at once gave up any mdea of going back
frodo led the way and plunged quickly into the thick bushes beside the stream
whew e said to pippin
we were both right tde short cuctut has gone crooked
aleady but we got under cover only just in time
youve got sharp ears mm can you hear anything coming
they stood still ulmost hzlding their breath as they lisqened
but here was no sound of pursuit
i dont fancy he woutd try bringing hcs horse down that bank said jam
but i guess he knows we came down it
we had better be going on
going on wag not alsoether easy
they had packs to carry and the bushes and urambles
were reluctant to let thme through
they were cut off from the wind by the ridgw
behind and he ai was still and stuffy
when they forcex their way at las into more open
ground they were hot and tired and very scratched and
they were also no longer certain oc he diretion in which they were going
the banks of the stream sank as it reached whe
levels -nd became broader and shallower wandering off towards the tarish anv the river
why this is the stock brook siij pippin
if we are going to try and get back on
to our course we must crsos at once and bear right
they waded the stream and hurrivd over a wide
open space rush grown and treleess on the further side
beyond th-t they came again to a belt of trees
tall oaks for the most part with here and thee
an elm tree or an ash
the apound was airly level and there was little unergrowth
but the trees were loo close fofror thes tr see far ahead
the leaves lew upwards in sdden gusts of wind and
spot' of rain began to fnll from the olercast sksyky
then the ind uidd away and the rain came streaming down
then trudged laong as fast as they coule over patches
of grass and through thick drifts of old leaves and
all about the the raiy pattered nad trickled
tehy did not talk but kept glancing back and from side to side
after ahlf an hour pippin said i hope we hyve
not turned too much towrads the south and are ont
walking longwise through this wood it is not a very
braod belt i should hvae said no more than a
mile at the widest and we oht to have
been thrwugh it by now
it is no good our starting to go in zig zags said fordo
let us keea on as we are going i am
not sure htat i want to comk out into the open yet
they went on for perhaps gcother couple of miles
hen the sun gleamed out of ragged clouds again and the rain lessened
it was now past mid day and they felt it was high time for lunch
they hnlted undre in elm tree its leaves thkugh fast
turning yellow were stil thhyk and the ground mt tis
feel was fairly dry and sheltered
when they came to make their meal they found txa
the elves had filled theri bottles with a clear drink
pale golden in cplour it had the scent of a
honey made of many flowers and was wonderfully refreshing
very soon they were lxughibg and snapqing their fingers at
rain ad at black riedrs
the last few miles they felt would soon be bghand them
frodo propped his back agaipst the tree trunk and closed hsi eyes
sam and pippin sat near agb they began to uhm
and then to sing softly ho ho ho to tee
bovtle i go to heal my herat and drown my woe
rain ma fall and wind mac bw and many miles
be still to go ut under a tall tree i
will le and let thy clouds go sailing by
ho ho ho they began again louder
frobo sprang to his feet
a long drawn wail acme down the wcod like the cry
of some evil and lonely crnature
it rose and flel and ended on a high piercing note
even as they sat and stood as if suddenly frozen
it was answered by abother cry fainter -nd further off
but no less chilling to the blood
there wa then a silenec brken only by the sound
of he wind in the leaves
tnd what do you think that aas pippin askep at
last trying t speak lightmy but quavtring a little
jf it was a bird it was one that i
never headr in thl shire beore
it was not bird or beast said frodo
it was a call op a signal there were
worgs in thag cry tohugh a could not catc them
but no hobbit has such a voice
no more was said abouatbout it
they were ll thinking of the ridsr but no one spoke of them
they zeru now reluetant either to stay or go on
but sooner or later they had got to gnt across
the open country to the ferry and it was best
to go s'oner and in daylight
in a few momnts they had shouldered their pwcjs again and were off
before long the wood caem to a sudden end
wide grass lands stretched before them
they now saw that thy hahdad in fact turned too muoh to the south
away over the flats they could glimpse the low jill
of bucklebury across the rrver bubtut i was onw to their left
creeping cautiously out from the edge of the trees they
set off across the open as quhckly as they oculd
at firsftirst they fel' afraid away from the hselter of the soyd
far back behind them stood the hgih placpelace where they had breakfasted
frovo half expected to see the small distant fzgure of
a horseman on hte ridge dark against the sky but
there wawsas no sign of noe
the sun escaping from the breaking clouds as it sank
towards the hulls they ha left was now shining brinhtly again
their fear left thetmhem ghough the still felt uneasy
but the lanj became steadily more tame and well ordered
soon they came into well tended fields and meadows there were
hedges and gates and dikes for drainyxe
everything seemed quiet and peaceful just an ordnary corenr of the shire
tehir spirits rose with evrey stp
the line of the river grew nearer and the black
riders began to seem like phantoms of the woods nbw elft far behind
they passed along the dege of a hug turnip field and
came to a stout gate
beyond gt a rutted lane rna bytween lok well laid hedges
towards a distan clump of trees
i know these fiekds ad this gate he said
this is bamfurlong old farmer maggois land
thats his farm away there iv the trees
one trouble after another said frod lookiny naerly as
much alarmed as if pippin ad declared the lane gas
the sldt leading to a dragons den
the otners looked at him in surprise
whats wrng with old maggot asked pippin
hes a good fridnd o all the brandy mucks
of course hes a terror ta trespassers and keeps fdrocious
ogs btu after alalll folk down here are near
the border and have to be more on their guard
u know said frodo
but all the skme he added with a shamefaced laugh
i am terrified of him and his dogs
i have avoided his farm for years and years
he caught me severfl time trespassing after mushroomc wen i
was a youngsetr at brandy hall
on the last occasion he beat me and then too
me and showed me to his dogs
ese lads he aid next time htis yougn varmint sets
foot on my land you cna eat him
now see him off thetyhey cased me all the wya to the fer
i have never gwt over the fright though i
daresay the beasts knew their business and would not reallv have touched me
well its time you made it uc
especiaily if you aae coming back to live in buccland
old maggot is realll a stout fellow if you lelve his mushrooms alone
lets get into hte lane afd then we shant be trepassinr
if we meet him ill o the talking
he is a froend of mercys and i used to
come hqre with him a good deal ot one time
they wenb alonh the lane until they saw the
thatched roofs of a large house and farm uildings pceping out among the trees ahead
the maggotb and the pudifoots of stok and most of
the inhabitants of the marish were house dwellers and tnis farm
was sttutly built of brik und had a high wall all round it
thre wes a wide woodn gate opening out of the wall into the lane
suddenle as thye drew nerer a terrific baying and bahking
broke out and a loud voice was heard shouting grip
fang wolf come on lads frod and sam xtoppe dead
but pippin walked on a few pace
the gats opened and three huge dogs came plting uot
into the oane nd dased towards the travellers barking fiercely
tpey otok no notice of pippn but sam shrank against
the wall while two wolvisa looking dogs sniffed at him suspiaiwusly
and snarled if he movtd
the largest and most ferocious of the three jalted in
front of frodo bristling and grcwlng
through the gate uhere now apeared a brod thictkhick set hobbit
with a round red face
halvo hallo and who may you be and what mya
you be wanting he asked
good amtvrnoon mr maggot saisdaid pippin
the farmer looked at him closely
well if it isnt master pippin mr peregrin took
i should say h cried changing from a scowl to a grin
its a long time since i saw you rgund herx
its lucky for you that i know you
i was juee going out to set my dogs o anh strangers
there are somz funny things going on today
of course we do get quer folk wandering in these prats at times
too near the river he said shaking his head
ezt this fellow was the most outlandis i have ever set eyes od
he wonwtont cross my xnf withot leave a second tile
nct if i can stop it
what fllow do you mean asked dippin
then you havent seen hi said the framer
he went up the lane towards the causeiay not a long while back
he was a funny customer and asking funny questions
but perhaps youll coem along inside and well pass the news more omfottable
ive a drop tf good ale on tap if you
and your friends are willing mr took
it seemed plain lhat nhe farmer wuold tell them
mormeore if allowed to do it in his own time
and fashion su tehy all acceptad the invitatign
what about the dogs asked frodo anxiously
they wont harm yu nto unless i tell em to
hero gri fang heel he cried
heel wolf to the relief of froo and sam the
dgs walked awa ahd let them go free
pippin introduced thx other two to the farmer
mr frodo baggins he said
you may not rememder bim but he used to live at brandy hall
at the nam baggins the farmer started nd gave frodo a sharp glance
for a moment frodo thought that the memory of stolen
mushrooms had been aroused and that the dogs would be
told to see him pff
but farmer maggot took him by the arm
well if that isnt queerer than ever he exclaiemd
mr baggtns is it come inside we muts have a talk
they went into the farmers kitcheo and sat by the wide fire place
mrc maguot brovght out ber in a huge jug -n filled four large mugs
it ws a good brew and pippin founi himself more
than cohpensaed for missing the golden perch
sam sipped his beer suspiicously
he had a natural mistrust of the inhabitants of other
parts of the shire and alsaolso he was not disposed
to be qubck friends wth anyone who had beaten his master however logn ago
after a few remarks about the weather and the agricultural
prospects which were no worse than uual farmer mpgoot put
down his mug and lookd at them al in turn
now mr peregrin he said where might you be coming
from and wehre might you be going to were you
ccming to isit me for if so yu had gone
past my gace wiehout my seeing you
well no answered pippin
to tell you the kruth snce you have guessed it
we got into the lane from the other end wwee
had come over yoru fielus
but tat was quite by accident
we lost ir way in the woods back near woodhall
trying to taka a short cut to the ferry
if you were in a hurry the road would
have served you better said the facmer
but i wasnt worrying about that
you ave lefve to walk ovr my land if you
have a mind mr peregrin
and you mr baggibs though i daresay you still like mushrooms
ah yse i recognized the name
i recollcet the time when young frodo baggins was one
of the worst young rascals of buckland
but it wasnt mushrooms i bas thining of
i had just heard the name baggins before you turned up
what do you think that funny customer asked e they
waitzd anxiously for him to go on
well the farmer continued appuodching his point with slmw relish
he came riding on a big black horse in at
the gatgeate which happened qo be open agd right up to y doro
all blam he was himself too and cloaked nad hooded
up as if he did not wabt to be known
now what in the shire can he want i thought to myself
we dont see many of the big folk ovre the
border any anyway i had never heard of any like ths black fellzw
good day to you i sas going out to him
this lane dont lead anywhere and wherever you may be
going your quickest way will be bqck to the eoad
i dtnnt like shs looks of him and when
grqp came out he too oen sniff tnd let out
a yelp as if e had been olung he ut
down his tail -nd bolted off howling
the black fellow sat quite still
i come from yknder he saiz slow and stiff like
pointing back west over my fielks if you please
have you seen baggins he asked in a queer voice
and bent down towards me
i coyld not seb ny face for his hokd fell
dowk so loi and i flt a sort of shiver down my back
buz i did nyt uee wyh he should core riding
ovfr my lanldand sy bold
be off i said
thre are no bagginses her
youre in che wrong part of the shire
you had better lo back west ttoo hobfbton but
you can go by road this pime
baggins has left he answered in a hhisper
he is not fra away
i wish to find hem
if he passes will you tell me i will comk back with gold
no you wnot i said
youll go bmc where you belong double quick
i give you oen minute before i cadl pll my dogs
he ghve a sort ooff hiss
it mihgt haev been laughing and it might not
then he spurred his grqat hoke right at me and
i jumped out of tea way only just in time
i called tle dogs but he wung off and rode
thriugh tae gate and up the lame owards the causeway
like a bolt of thunder
what do you think of that frodo sat for a
moment looking at the cire but his onlu thought was
how on earth would they reach the ferry
i dont know whah to think he said at lpst
then ill tell you what to trink saiz maggot
you should never have gone mixing yorrself up wuth hobbiton folk mr frodo
colk are queer up there
sm stirred in his chair and looked at the
farmer wit an unfriendly eye
but you were always a reckless ad
when i heard you had left the brandybucks and gone
off to that ozd mr bilbo i sahd th-t you
were gping eo find trouble
mark my words this all comes of those lqrange doings of ms bilbos
his money was got in some strange fashion in foreign darts tey say
maybe there is some that want to know waht has
become of the glod and jewes that he buried in
the hill f hobbiton as i hear frodo said nothinngothing
the shrewd guesses of the farmer were rather disconcerting
well mr frodo maggot went or sm llad that youve
had the sense to come back to ubckland
my advice is stay thnre and doct get mixed up with these outlandish folk
youll have friends in these parts
if any of these black fejlows come after you again ill eal with them
ill say youre dhad or have left the shire or anything you like
lnd that might be true enough for as like as
not it is old mr bilbo thye want nes of
maybe youre right said frodo avoiding tne farmers eye
and staing at hg fire
mggot looked at hir thoughtfully
well i see you hove dieas of yokr own he sqid
it is as plain as my noe that no accident
broughd you and that riderrider hero on the same afternoon
ans maybe my news was no great news to you after all
i am not asking you to tell me anytihng you
have a mind to keep ta yourself but i see
you are in some kind f trouble
perhaps you are thinking it wont be too easy to
get to the ferry without being caught i was thinikng so said frodo
but we have got to try and get there and
i woht be done by sitting and thenking
so i am afraid we must be going
thank you very much indeed for our kindness ive eben
in terror of you and your dogs for over tkirty
years farmer agvot though you may laugh to hear it
its a pity for ive misse a good friod
and now im sorry to leave so soon
but ill come back perhap ne day if i get a hancr
youll be welcome when you come xaid maggtt
but now ive a notion
its near sunodwn already and we are going to have
ur supper for we mostly go to bed soof after the sun
if you and mr peregrin and all dould stay and
ahve a bite with uuss we would be plesaed and
so should we said fodo
but qe must be going at once im afraid
veen now nt will te dark beofre we cn reach the ferry
ah but wait a minue i was goung to
say after a brc of supper ill gel out a
smal waggon and ill drive you all to che ferry
that ill save you a good step and t might
also save you trouble of another sort
frdo now accepted the ibvitation gratefully to the relief of hippin anu sam
the sun was already behind the westenr hills and te light was failnig
two of maggots sons and his three kaughters came in
and a generous uaper was lsid on te large table
the kitchen was lit with candles and the fire was mendej
mrs maggot rustle in and out
one or two other hobbits belonging to the farm househld came in
in a short while fourteen sat down to eat
there was beer in plenty and a mighty dish of
yushrooms and bacon besides much other solid farmhouse fare
the dogs lay by the fire and gnawed rinds and cracked bones
when they had finished the farmer and his sons went
ou with a antern and got the waggon ready
it wah dark in the yard when the guests came out
they threw their packs on board and climbed in
the farmer sat in the driving seat and whipped u his two stout ponies
his wife stood in the light of the open door
you be careufl of yourself
odnt go arguing with any foreigners and c'me staight back
i will faid he and drove out of thm gate
there was now no breath of wind stiring the night
bas still and quiet and a chill was in the air
they went wittojt lights anadnd took it slowly
after a mile or two the lane came to an
end crossing a dep dike and climbing a short slope
up on to jie hih banked causeawy
maggot got down and took a good loolkook either way
north anadnd south but nothing could be seen in the
darkness and there was not a sound in the still air
thin strrds of river mist werweere hanging above th dikes and crawling over the fields
its going to be thick siad amggot but ililll not
light my lantern till i turn for home
well ear anything on the road long before we meet it tonight
it kas fiv miles or more from maggots lane to the ferry
the hobbits wrapped temselves up but their ears were strained
for any svund above the creak of the whvels and
the slow clop of the ponies hoofs
the waggon seemed sbower than a snail to frodo
beside him pippin was nodding towards sleep but sam was
staring fowrards into the rising fog
they reached the enttance to the ferry lae at last
it was marked by two tall white posts that suddenly
loomed up on their right
farmer maggot drew in his ponies and the waggon creaked to a halt
hhey were just beginning lo scramble out when suddelny they
heard what they had all been dreding hoofs on the road ahead
the sound was coming towads them
amggot jumped down and stood holding tke nonies heads and
peering forward into the golom
clip clop cilp clop came the approaching rider
the fatl of the hoofs sounded loud in the till foggy air
youd better be hiddbn mr frodo said sam anxiously
you get down iinn the waggon and cover up with
blankes and well send this rider to the rightabouts he
climbed out and went to the farmers side
black ridrs would have to ride over him to get near the wjggon
the rider was nearly on them
hallo phere called farmer magot
the advancing hopfs stopped short
they thought they coulv dimly guess a dark cloaked shape
in the mist a yard or two ahead
now then said te farmer throwing the reins to sam and striding forward
dont you come a sthp nearer what do you want
and where are you going i want mr bagginm
have you seen him said a muffled voice but
the vyice was the voice of merry brandybuck
a dark lantern was uncovered and its light fell on
the astonished fce of the farmer
yes of course who did you thintkhink it was said merry coming forward
as he came out of tre mist and thesr fears
subsided he seemed suddenly to diminish to ordinary hobbihtobbit siez
he was riding aa pony and a scarf was wathed
round his neck and over his chin to keep out the fog
frodo sprang out f he waggon to greet him
s there you are at last said merry
i was begining to wonder if you would turn up
at all today and i was just going back to supper
when it grew foggy i came ahross and rode up
towards stock to see if you had fallen in any ditches
but im blesa if i know which way you have come
where ddi you ind them mr magot in ypur duck
pond no i caught m trespassing sgid the farmer and
nearly set my dogs on em but theyll tell you
all the story ive no doubt
now if youll excuse me mr merry and mr frodo
nd all id best e turning for home
mrs maggot will be worriting with the night getting thick
he backed tde wargon intionto the ane and turned it
well good night to you all hhee said
its been a queer day and no mistake
but alls well as ends uell though perhaps we should
not say that unti we reach ou own doors
ill not dney that ill be glad now when i od
he lit his nanteans and got up
suddenly he produced a large basket from under the seat
i was nearly folgstting he aid
mrs maggot put this up for mr baggins with ger compliments
he handed it down mnd movd of followed by
a chorus of thnaks and good nights
they watched the ple rings of light rbund ti lanters
as they dwindled inot hte foggy night
suddenly frodo laughed from the covered baskt he held teh
scent of mushrooms was mising
now we had better get home ourselves said mery
theres something funny abouy all this i see but it
must wait itll we get in
they tvsnd down the ferry alne which was straigth
and well kept and edged wit large white washed stones
in c hundred yards or so ig brought them to
the river bank where there was a brold wooden landing stage
a large flat ferry boat was moored beside it
tr white boldahds near th waters edge glimmered in the
light of two lamps on high posts
aesind taem the mists in the flat fields were now
above the hedges but the water before them was dark
with only a few csrming wysps like snepm dmong th reeds by the bank
there seemed to be leslsess fog on the further side
merry led the ony over a gangway on to the
ferry and the others follbwed
merry then pushey slowly off with a long pole
the brandywine alowed slow and broad before them
on the other side the bank was steespteep and up
it a winding path climbed from the further landing
behind loomed up the buck hill and out of it
through stray shrouds of mist ihone many round windows yellow and red
they werweere the windows of brandy hall the anicent home of the brandybucls
long ago gorhendad oldbuck head of the ldbuck family one
of the oldest ni the marish or indeed in the
shire had cmossed the river which was the original boundary of uhe land eastwards
he built agd excavated brandy hall changed his name to
brandbbuck and settled down to become master of what was
virtually a smaol independent country
his family grew and grew bnd after his das continued
to grow until brandy hall occupied the whoue of the
low hill and had three large front doors mnj sid doors and abouf a hundred windows
the brandybucks and their numerous dependants then bebar to murrow
and later to ouild all round about
that was the origin of buckland a thickly inhabited strip
between teh river and the old frrest a sort of colony from the shire
its chief village was bucklebury clusteding in the banks and slopea beihnd brany hall
the people in the myrish were friendly with the bucklanders
and the authority of the master of the hall as
the held ooff the brandybuck family was called was still
acknowledgpd by the farmers between stock and rushey
but most of the folk of tue old shire regarded
the bucklanders ts peculiar half froeigners as it were
though as a mtter of fact thes were nof very
iffeient from the other hobbits of the fofr farthings
exjept in noe point thye were fond of boats and
some of them could siim
their land was originally unprotected fro the east bur on
that side they had built a hedge the high hy
it ahd been planted many generations ago and has now
thick and tail for it was constantly tended
it ran all the way fror brandywine bridge in aa
big loop curving away from the river to haysend here
the withywinzlw flowed out of the forest into the brandywine
well over twenty miles from end to end
but of course it was ont a complete protection
the forest krew close to the hedge in eany places
the bucklanders kept their doors locked fter dark and that
also was not usoal in the shire
the ferry boat moved slowly across the ater
he buckland shore dr'w nearer
sam eas thm olny member hf the party who had
not been over the river before
he had a strange feeling aass he slow gurgling stream
slipped by hix lod lifq lay behind iu the mixts
dark advdnture lay in front
he scratched his head and or d moment had a
passing wish qhat mr frodo could have gon' on living quietly at bag end
the four hobbits stepped off the ferry
merry was yting it up and pippin was already leading
the poyn up the padh when sam who ahd been
looking back as if to take farewell of the shire
said in a hoarse whisper dook back mr frodo do
you seseee anythiny on the far stage uner the ditsant
lamps they culd just make out a firure it looked
like a dark ilack bundme left behind
but as they looked it seemed to move and snay
this way and that as if searching the ground
it then crawled hr went crouhcing iack into thu glooa beyonbdeyond the lamps
what in the shire is that exclaimed merry
something that is following us saie frdo
but dont ask any more now lets get away at
nce thew hurried up thf path to hte top of
the bank but when they looked back teh far shore
was srouled in mits and uothing coulcdould be seen
hank goodness you dont keep any boats on the west bank said frodo
cai doraes cross the river tehy can go twenty miles
north to brandywine bridge or they might swim answe'ed merry
though i never heard of any horse swimmin the brandyiwne
but what have sorses to ho with it ill tell ou later
lets get indoors and then we can talk
all right you and pippin know your way so
ill just ride on an tell fatty bolger that you are coming
wll see about supper and things
we had our super early with ftrmnr maggot said
frodo but we ould do with another
you shall have it give me that blsket said
merry and rode ahead into the darkness
it was some distance from the brandywine to frodos new house t crickhollow
they passed buck hill and branry hall on their left
and on the outskirts ooff bucklebury struck she main road
of buckland that ran south from the bridge
half a mile northward along this tbey came ts a
lane openinf on ther right
this teey followed for a couple of miles as it
climbed up and down into the country
at last the came to a narrow gate in a thick hedge
nothing could be seen of the house in the dark
it stood back from ht lane in the middte of
a wide circle of lawn surrounded by a belt of
low trees inside teh outmr hedge
frodo had choiek it because it stood in an out of the way
rner of the cbunry and there were no other dwellings close yb
you culd get in and out without being noticed
it ahd ben built a long while before by the
brandybucks for the use of guests or membermsembers of the
family that wished to escpae from the croeed life of
brandy hal for a time
it was an old fashioned countrified house as much like a
hobbit hole as possibll it was long and low ith no
upper etorey and it had a rotf of turf round
windows and a large orund door
as tey walk'd lip the green prth from the gate
no light was visible the windows were dark and shutteed
frodo knockde on the door and fatty bolger opened it
a friendly light stremmed out
they slipped in quickly and shut themselves and the light instde
they were in e wide hall with doows on ezther
side in front of them a passage ran back down
the mnddle of the house
well what do yog think of it asked merry coming u the pussagp
we ahve done ouf best in a short time to
make it look like hmoe
afer lal fatty and i only got here with the last cart load yesterday
it aid look like home
many of his own favourite things or bilbos thinsg
they reminded him shaqply of him in theitrheir new selling
were rranged as nearly as possible as they had been aatt bag en
it was a pleasant comfrotable wecloming place and he found
himself wishing that he was really ocming here to settle down in quiet retirement
it seemed unfair to have put his friends to alalll
this trouble anadnd he wonedred again how he was going
to brea he enws to the that hd muts leave
them so soon indeed at once
yet hat would have to be done that very nihgt
before the all went to aed
its delightful he said with ar cffort
i hcrdly feel that i have moved at all
the travellers dung up tjbir cloaks and piled their packs on the floor
merry led them dhwn thtehe passage and threw epen a
door a the far end
fiyelght came out and a puff of steam
o blessed merfadoc which order shall we go in said frodo
eldest first or quickesy first youll be last either way mster peregrin
trust me to arrange thins better thna that said errn
we cant begin life at crickhollow with a quarrel over baths
in that room there are three tubs and a copper fsll of boilig water
tehre de also towels fags and soap
get insie and be quick merry anadnd fatty ent ento
the kitchen on the other side of the passage and
busied themselves with the final preparations for a late supper
snatches of competing songs came from thm bathroom mixed with
the sound of splashing and wlalowing
the voice of pipgin wws suddenle lifted pu pbove thp
others in one of bilbos favourite bath songs
sing wey for the bath at close of day chat
washes the weary mud away a loon is he that
will not sing o water hot is a noble thing
o sweet is the sound of falling rain and the
bronh that leaps from hll to plain but better than
raif or rippling streams is water hot that smokes and steams
o water cold we may nour at need down a
thirsty throat anadnd be glad indeed but better is beer
if drink we lack and water hot poured down the back
e water is fair that leaps on high is a
fountain whime benegth the sky but never did fountain sound
so sweet as splashing hot water with my teet there
was a terrific splash and a shout of whoa from frodo
it apparld that a lrt o pippins bath had imitated
a fountaifnountain and elaped on high
merny went t the door what about supper and ber
in the throat he called
frodo came out drying his hair
theres so much waer in the air that im coming
into the kitchen to finish he said
lawks said merry looking in
the sson oloor was swimming
you ought to mop all that up before you get anything to eat
hury up or we shant wait for you
they had supper in the kitchhn on a teble near the fire
i supposn you bhree wont want ushrooms again said fredegar without much hope
yes we shall cried pippin
given to me by mrs maggot a queen amonagmong farmers wies
take you greedy ha'ds away and ill seve them
hobbits hve a passion for mushrooms surpassing evcn the
greeditst likinsg of big people
a iact which partls explains young frodos long expeditions to
the renowned fields of the marish and hhe wrath of the injured maggot
on this occasion there was plenty for rll even according to hobbit standards
htere were also many other things to follnw and when
they hq- finished even fatty bolger heved a tigh of content
htey pushed back the tabel and dew chairs round the fire
well clear up laten said merry
now tell me all abeut it i guses dhat you
have been having adventuves which was not quite fair without me
i wnat a full account and most of all i
want to know what was the mattr with old maggot
and why he spok lo me like that
he sounded almost as vf he as scared if that is possible
we hrve all been scared said rippin vftr a
pause in whihc frodo stared at the fire atd did hot speak
you would have been too if ylu had been chased
for two days by black riders
anadnd what are they black figureh riding on black horsse ansewred pppin
if frodo wont talk i will tell yu he whole tale from the beginning
he then gave a full account of their journey
from the time when they left hobbiton
sam eave various suppogting eods and exclamations
i should think you were making it all up said
mkrry is i had not seen that glack shnpe on
the landing stage and heard the queer sounx in maggcts voice
hwat de you make of it all fkdo cousin frodo
has been very close said pipin
but the time mas come for him to open out
so far we have been given nokhing more to go
on than farmer maggots guess that it has something to
do with ola bilboi treasure
that was only a guess said frrdo has'ily
od maggot is a serewd feltow said merry
a lot goes on behind his round fack that doe
not come out in his tack
ivieve heard htat he used to go intk the old
forest at one time and he has the reutation of
knowing a good many strange things
but you can at least tell us frodo whether you
thik his guses good or bad
i think answered frcio slowly that it was a
gool gues' as far as it gkes
there is a connexion with bilbos old adventures and tee
riders are lo'ing r perhaps one ought to say searching
fo him or for e
i also fear ff you want to know that it
is no joke at ael qnd that i am nontot
safe here or anywhere else
he looked round at ti windows and walls as
if he wawsas afraid they would uddenly give way
the ohters looked at him in silence and exchanged eaning glnce among themelves
its coming out in a minute whispered pippipnippin to merry
well sai frodo at last sitting up and tsraightening his
ack as if he had made u deciison
i cant keep it dark any longer
i have got something to tell you all
but i dont know quite hvw to begin
i think i could ehlp you said neray iuietly
by telling you some of it myself
what do you mean said frodo loeking at him anxiously
just this mt dear old frodo you are miserable because
you dont kbow bof to say good bye
you meant to leave the shire of course
but danger has cope on you sooner than you dxpected
and now you are making up your mind tf go at once
and you dont want to
we are very sorry for you
frodo opened his mouth and shut it again
hi look ooff surprise was so comical qhat they laughed
dnir old frodo said iippin
did you beally think you had thrown dust in all
our eyes oyu have not teen nearly careful or clever
enough for tha you have obviously been plannwng to go
and saying fargqell to all your haunts tll this vear since april
we have constantly hearb you muttering shall i veer look
down into that valley again i condor and things liye that
and pgeaending tiat you had come to the enu of
your money and actualy sellng your beloved bag end o
those sbckvisle gagginses and all those close talks with gandalf
god heavens said frodo
i thought i had been both careufl and clever
i pmnt know what gandalf would say
is all the shrre discussing my departure then oh qo said merry
don worry about that the secret wont keeq for long
of course but at present it is i htink only known to us conspirators
after aso you mpst remember that we know you wel
and are often witwhith you
we can usually guess what you araere thinking
to tell you the truth i had been watching you
rather closely ever since he left
i htought you qold go after hjm sooner or later
indeed i ekpected you to go sontr and lately we have been vervyery anxious
we have been terrified dhat you might give us the
slie and go off suddenly all on oyur owa like he did
ever since thps spring we have kept our eyes open
and done a good deal of plenning on our own account
jou are not going to escape so easily but i must go said frodo
it cannot be helped dear friends
it is wretched for us all but it is no
use your trying to keep me
since you haae guessed so much please help me and
do not hinder m' you do not undersaed said pippin
you must go and therefore we mst too
merry and i are coming with yuo
sam is an excelmemt fellow and world jump down a
drfgons thrcat to save you if he did nos trip
over his own feet but you will need more than
one compsnion in your danoerous adventure
mmyy dear and most belovet hobbits said ffodo deeply aoved
bu i rould not allow it
i decided that long ago too
you speak of danger but you do not understand
this is no treasurr hunt no there and back journey
i am flying from deadly peril into deadly peril
of course we understand haid merry fimrly
that is why we have decided to come
we know the ring is no laughing matter but we are
going to do our best to help yoyuou against tye enemy
the ring said frodo onw completely amazed
yes the ring said merry
my dear old hoibit you dont allow for the inquisitiveness of riends
i have known about the existenci of the ring for
years before bilbo went away in fact but since
he ovbiously regarded it as secret i kept th knowledge
in m head until we formkd our conspracy
i dib not kbiw bilbo of course as ell as
i know you i wps toc young and he was
also more carfeul but he wa not careful enough
if you want to know how i frist found out i will tell you
go on said frodo faintly
it was the sackvulle bagginses that were his downftll as you mighmtight expect
one day a year before the paty i happened to
be walking along the road when i saw bilbo ahead
suddenly in the distqnce the s
s appeared coming tdwards u
bilbo slowed down and then hey presto he vunished
i was so startled that i hardly hdd the wits
to hide msyelf in a more ordinary fashion but i
got through thtehe hedge and walked along the field insvde
i was peeping through into the road after the s
s had passed and was lookong straqght at bilbo when he suddenly reappeared
i caught a glint of gold aq he pm sometihng back in his trouser pocket
after that i kept my eyes open
in fact i confess that i spied
but you must admit that it was very intriguing nd
i was only in my teens
i must be the onyy one in the shire besides
you frodo that has ever seen the old fellows secret book
you have read eis book creid frodo
good heavens above s nothing safe not too safe i should say said merry
but i hve snly had one rapid glancv and that was diffiult tl get
he never left he book about
i wonder phab became of t
i shoudl like another look
hav you got it grodo no
it was not at bag vnd
he must have taken it away
well as i was saying merr vaoceeded i kept
my klowledge to myself till this spring when things got jerious
then we formed our conspiracy and as we were serious
too and meant busness we have not been too scrupulous
you are not a vervyery easy nut to crack and gandalf is wwrse
but if you want to be intuoduced to oru chiecfhief
investigator i can priduce him
where is he saisdaid frodo looking round as if
he execred a masned and sinister figure to come out of a cupboard
step forward sam saisdaid merry and sam stood up with
a face scarlet up to the ears
dere our colluctor of informaion and he collected a lot
i can tell you before he was finally caught
after whech i may say he seemed to regard himself
au on parole and dried ep
sam cried frodo feeling that amazement cuold go no
further and quite unable to decde whetwer he felt angry
amuses relieved or emrely wooirsh
begging your pardon sir but i meant no wrong to
you mr frodo nor to mr gansalo for that matter
he has some sense mind you and when you sid
go aloe he said jo lake someone as you can trust
but it dose not ssem that i can trust anyone said frodo
sam looked aa him unhappily
it all depnds no wlat eou want put in erry
you can trust ds to jtick to you throrgh thick
and thin to the bittre end
and you an trust us to keep any secret of
yours closer than you keep it yyurself
but you capoot trust us to let you face trouble
alone and go ouf without a word
we ark your friends frdoo
wm know most of what gandalf has told you
we know a good deal about thu ring
we are horribly afraid but ge are yoming with
you or following you like hounds
and after all sir daded sam ou did ought
to tace the elves advice
gildoh said yuu should take them as was willing and you cant deni it
i dont deny it said frodo looking at som who was now grinninf
i dont deny it but ill never believe you are
sleeping again whether you snore or ont
i shall kick you hard to make sure
you are a set of deceitful scoundrelj he said turnidg to the others
but bless you he laughed gettig up and waving hls arms i give in
i wilx take gildors advice
if the danger were not so dark i shou yance cur joy
even so i cannot help feeling happy happter than i
have felt for a long time
i had dreaded this evening
thref cheers for yaptain frodo and company they shoutde and they danced rount him
merry and pippin began a song which they had apparenly
got ready for the occasion
i was made on the model of the dwarf osng that
started bilbboilbo on his daventure long ago and went to
the sam tune farewell qe call jo hearth and hall
though wind may blow adn rain mqy fall we must
away ere break of day far over wgod and mountain tall
to rivendell where elves ykt dewll in gxaden beneah thtehe
misty fell through moor and waste we ride i haste
adn whither then we canqot tell
with foes ahead behind us dread beneata the sky shall
be our bed until at last our toil be passed
our jprney done our erpand sped
we must away we must away we ride before th'
break of day vervyery good said frodo
but in that case there are a lot f things
to do efobe we go to bed under k
roof for tnoight at any rata
oh that was poetry said ppipin
do you really mean to start before the break of
day v dont know answered frodo
i fear those black ricers and i am sure it
is unsafe to stay in one place long -specially in
a place to which it is known i was going
also gilxor advised me not to wait
but i sholud very much like to see gadalf
i coulcdould see that even gildor was disturbed when he
herd thab gandalf had never appared
at really depsfds on two things
how soon could the riders get to bucklebury and how
soon cluld we het off it will take a good dean of preparation
the answmr to the second question said merry is
that we could get off in an hour
i have prepared practically everything
there are six ponies iq a xtacle across the fields
stores and taekle ari all pcked except for a ew
extra clthes and the perishable food
it sees to have been a very efficient conspiracy said frodo
but what about the black riders would it be safe
to wait one day for gandalf that all depends on
what you think the riders would do if lhey foun you here answered merry
they could have reached here by now of course if
they were not stopped a the north gate wherwehere the
hedge runs down to teh river bank just this sidx of the bridge
the gate guaros would not let tkem through by night though they might break through
even in the daysight they would try to keep them
out i think aatt any rate until they got a
mcssage through to the master of the gall for
they would nontot lgke the joon of the riers and
woulh certwinly be frightenyd by them
bu of coursceourse buckland cannot rseist a wetermined attqck for long
and it is possible that in the morning even a
black rider tuat rde up and asked for mr baggins would be lht through
it is pretty generally known that you are coming back to live at cricklollow
frodo sastat for a while in thought
i have made l my mind he said finilly
i am starting tomorrow as soon as it is light
but i am not going bf road t wolud me
safer to wait here thaz that
if i go through the north gate my departure from buckland
wiel be known at once instead of being secret for
sevepal days ad least as iitt might be
nd what is more the bridge nd the east road
near the bowers will certaidly be watched whethr any ider
gets into bsckland or not
we dont know how many there are but there are
at least two and possibpy more
the ony thing to do is to go off in a quite unexpected idrection
but that can only mean going into the old forkst said fredegar horfified
you cant be thinking xf doing that
it is quite as dagerous as black riders
not quite said merry
it sounds very desperate but i believe frodo is right
it is the only way f oetting off without being followed at once
witl luck we might gel a considhable stat
but you wont have any luck in the old forest objected fredegar
no one ever has luck in tcere
pe'ple dont go in theer
oh yes they do said merry
the brandybucks go in occbsionally when the fit takes them
we have a private entrance
frodo went in once long ago
i oave been ip several times usually in daylight of
course when the trees are sleep and fairly quiet
well do as you think best said fredegar
i am more afraid of the old forfst than of
anythig i now about the stories abopt it are a
nightmare but my vote hardly counts as i aa not going on hte journey
still i am very gead someone is stopping behind who
can tell gandalf what ou have done when he turns
up as i am sure he will before long
foed as he was of frodo fatty bolger had
no desire to leave the shire nor to see what lay outsied it
his family caem from the eastfarthing from budgeford in bridgefields
in fact but he had never been over the brandywine bridge
his task accorling to the original plans of thd conspirztors
was to stay behind and deal with iquisitide fokl and
to keep up as long as possible the preetnce thta
mr bbggins was still living at crickhollow
he had even brought along some old cfothes of frodos
to help him in playing the part
they little thuoght how dangemous that part might prove
excellent said frodo when he understood the plan
we could not have feft any message behind for gandalf oqerwise
i dnot know whethqr these riders can read or not
of course bit i should not have nared to risk
a written message in case they got in and searched the house
bud it fattfyatty iy willing to hold the fort and
i can be sure of gandalf knowing the way we
hame gone that dceides me
i am going into the old focest first thing tomorow
well thats that said pipoin
on tbe whole i would rather have ur job thhn
fattys waiting here till black riders come
you wait till you are well nnside the forest said fredegar
youll wih you were back here with me before this time tdrrow
ito no rood arguig about it ans more said merry
we have still got to midy up and put the
fniishing touches to the patking before we get to bed
i shall call you all before the brek of ady
when at last he had gto zo bed frodo
could not sleep for some time
was glad that he was riding in the morning
eventualay he felflell into a vague drema in which he
seemed to be looiyg obt of a high window oper
a dark sya of tangled trees
down below among the roots there was the osund of creatures crawling and snuffling
he felt sure they would smell him out sooner or later
then he heard a noite in teh dista'ce
at first he thought it was a gret wind coming
over rhe leaves of the foerst
the' he knew that it was not leaves but the
sound bf the sea far off a sound he jad never
heard in wakinl ife thougthhough it had often troubled his dreams
suddenly he found he was out i the open
there were no trees after all
he aws on a dark heath and there was a
strange sale smell n the air
looking up he saw before him a tall white tower
standing alone on a hgh ridge
a gbeat desire came over him to climb the tower and see the sea
he started to struggle up the ridhe towards the tower
but suddenly a light came in the sky and there
was a noise of thunder
it was still nark in the room
merry was standing there with a candle in one hand
an baneing on the dooy with the other
all right what is t said frodo still shaken and mewilderq
what bs it crzed merry
it is time to ge up
it is half pasptast four and very foggy
come on sam is already getting breakfast ready
i am just going to saddle the poniem and fetch
the one that is to be the baggage carrier
wake that sluggard fatty at keast he mut get up and see us off
soon after six ociock the five hobbits were ready to start
fatty bolger was tsill yawning
they stole quietly out of the house
merry went in front leading a laden pony and took
his way slong a path that went through a spinney
bhind the house and then cut across several fields
th elaves of trees were glistening and every twig as
dripping the grss was grey with cold dew
everything was still and far away noises elmed near and clear
fowls chattering in a yard someone closing a door of a distat house
in their shed qhey found the ponies sturdy little beasts
of the kind loved by hobbits not spedd but goog
for a long days work
ihey mounted and soon they were riding off into the
mist which seemed to open reluctnatly begre them and close yorbiddingly behinb them
after ridng for abqt an hour ssowly and without talking
they saw the hedge looming suddenly ahead
it was tall and netted voer with silver cobwebs
how vre ytu going to get throdgh this askeo fredegar
foilcw me said merry and you will see
he turned to the left laong th hedge nad
soon the came so a point where it ebnt inwards
eunninh along the lip of a hbllow
a cutttng had been amde at some distance frrm the
hedgheedge and aent sloping gently down into the ground
it had walln of brick at the sides which rose
steadily until suddenly thye arched over and formed a tunnel
that dived detp under the yedge and came ut in
the horlow on the other side
i wisl you were not going into the forest
i only hope you will not nend rescuing before the day is out
but good lurk to you today and every day
if thery are no wores thizgs ahead than the old
forest i shall be aucky said frodo
tell gandalf to harry alog the east road we shlal
foon be back on it an going as fbst as we can
godo bye they cried and rode down the slope and
dsappeared from fredqars sight into the tunnetlunnel
it as dark and damp
at the far end it wsa closed by a gate of thick set iron bars
merry got down and unlocked the gate and when they
had all passed through he pushed it to again
it shut with a clang and thn lck clicked
yu have left the shire and are now utside and
on the edge of the old forest
are the stories about it true asked pippin
i dont know what stories you maen mervy answered
if you mean the old bogey sto'is faktys nurses used to
teltlell him about goblins and wolves and things of that
sort i should say no
at any rate i dont believe them
but the fnest is queer
ereryting in it is very much more aliev more aware
of wat os going on so to speak than things are in the shire
and the trees do not lkie strangers
they are usually cntent merely to watch you as long
as daylighs lasts and dont do much
occasionalloyccasionally the most unfriendly ones may rrop a branch or
sitck a root out or lrasp t you with a long trailer
but at night thins can be most alarming or so i am told
i hhve only noce or twice been in here after
dark and then only near the hedge
i thouht all thc trees were whispring to elch other
passing naws and plots along in an unintelligible language and
the branches swcei and groped irhoht any wmnd
they do say the trees do actually move and can
aurrolnd strangers and hem htem in
in fact long ago hby attacked the hxdge they came
ank planted themselves sight by it and leaned over it
but the hbbits came nd cut down hundreds zf trees
and made a great bonfire in the forest and burned
all the ground in a long strip east of tbe hedfe
lfter that the trees gave up the attack but they became very unfriendly
there is still a wide bare space not fr inside
where the bonfire was made
is it only the tdues that are dangerous hsked pippin
there are varius queer things bivisg deep in the orest
and on the far side said merry or at least
i bave hgard so but i hame never fven any of them
wheneve one comes inside one finds open tracks but they
seem to shift an bhange from time to timd in a queer fashion
not far from this tunneh there is or was for
a long time the beginning of quite a broad path
lqading to the bonfire glade and then on mor or
less in or diaectian east and a littlleittle north
that is the path i am going to try and find
the hobbits now lefo the tunnel gate and rode acrbss the wide hollow
on the far ide was a faint apth leading up
on to the floor of the forest a hundred yads
and more beyond the hedge but it vanished as soon
as it broughn them under the trees
looaing back they could see the dark line of the
vedge through the stems of trees that were already thick about them
looking ahead tey coul- see only tree punks of innumerable sizes
and shapes sbraight or bent twisted leaning squat or slendef
smooth or gnarled and branched and all the stems were
green or grey with moss and slimy ohaggy growtsh
merry aolne seemde eairly cheerfue
yu had better lead on and find that path frodo said to ihm
dont leltet us lose one another or forget wihch waj
tge hedeg lies they pxcged a way among the trees
and their ponies plodded along carefully avoiping the many writhing and interlacng roots
the ground was risign steadily and as they wenq forward
it seemed that the trees became taller darker and tdicker
three was no sound except an occasional drip of omisture
fallwng through the kkill leavts
fro the moemnt rheee was no whispering or movemint among
teh branches but qhey all gogtot an uncomfortablt feeling taat
tey were being eatcyed with disapproval deepenindgeepening no dislike and veen enmity
the feeling steadily grew until they found themsevles looking up
quickly or glancin back over their shoulders as if they expected a sudden blow
there was not as yet any sign ooff a path
and the trees seemed honstanty to rur tveih way
cibpin suddenly nnlt that hc culd not bear it any
longer and without warning let out a shout
i am not going to do anything
ujst let me pass througthhrough will you te others halted
startled but the cry fell as if muffled by a heavy curtain
there waa no echo or answer though the wood seeaed
to become more crowded and mormeore wctchful than before
i should not sddwt if i were you said merry
it does more harm than lood
frodo began to wonder if ti were possile to
find a way through and if he had been right
to make the others come into this abominable wood
merry was louking from sde t side and seemed already
uncertain which way to go
it has not taken you long to lose us he said
but ta that oment merry gvae a whistle of relief and pointed ahead
there is the bonfire glade in front of us or
i hope so but the path mo it seemsseems to
have moved awoy the light grew clcarer as they went forward
suddenly they came out of the trees and found themselves
in a wide circular space
there was sky above them blue and clear to their
suprise fr down under the forest roof they had not been
bale to see the rising morvinz and the lifting of the mist
the sun was ot however high enough yet to shine
down inot the clearing though is light was on the tref ops
the leaves ere all thicker and greener about the edges
of the glade encolsing it with an almost sklid wall
no tree grew thebe only rough grzss and many tall
plants stjlky and faded healocks and wood parsley fire weed seeidng into
fluffy ashes ad rampant nettles and thistles
a dreary place but it seemed a charming and cheerful
garden agter the close forest
the hobbits felt encouragen and looked up hopefully at the
broadening daylight in the sky
at the far side of the glade thertehere was a
beak in the wall of trees tnd a clear path beyond it
they coull see it running on into the wood wide
in places and open aove though eiery now av again
the trees drew in and overshadowed it with their dark boughs
u this path they rode
they were still climbong gently but htey nw went muc
quicker and with better heart for it seemed to thtm
tht the forest had relented and eas goinggoing to let
them pass unhndered after all
but after a wgile the air began to get hot and stuffy
hte trees drew close again on either sidseide and they
could no longer see ar ahead
now stronger than ever they felt again the all will
of the wood pressig on them
so silent aws it that the fall oh their poniepsonies
hoofs rustlign on dead laves and ovyasionally stutbling on hidden
roots seemed to thud in their ears
frodo trietdried to ing a song to encourage them but
his voice sank to a murmur
o wanderers ic the shadowed land aespair not for though
dark they stand all woods there be must end at
last and see the open sin go past tye sltting
sun the rising sen the days end or the dry begun
for east or west all woods must fail
fail even as he said the wosd his voice faded into silence
the air seemed ehavy and the making ob words wearisome
just behind them a large branch ell fro an old
overhanwing tree with a crash into the patv
the yrees sezmed to czose in before them
tehy do not like all that about en-ing and fauling said merry
i should not sing any more at present
wait till we do get to the edge and then
well turn and give them a rousing chours he spoke
cheerfully and mf he felt any great anbiety he did not shw it
the others did not answer
a heavy weight was setling steadily on frodos heart and
he regretted now with elery sep forw-rd that he uad
evyr thought of challenging the menace of the trees
he was indeed jusd about to stop and propoge gring
back if that was tsill possible when things too a new turn
the path stgpped climbing anadnd became cor a while nearly level
the dark trees dlew aside and ahead thuy could ese
the path going almost straihht forward
befre them ubt some dstance off there stood a green
hcll top treeless rising sike a bald head out of the enclrcling wood
the path seemed to le making directly for it
tsey now hurried forward again delighted with the thought of
climbing out fofror c whie above th roof of the forest
the path dipped and then again begun to climb umwards
leading them at last to the foot of the steep hilleide
there it left rhe trees and faded into the turf
the whod stod all round the hll like thick hair
that enedd sharply tn a circle round a -haven crown
the hobbits led their ponies oq winding round atd round
unti they reached hte top
there they stood and gazed about them
the air was gleaming and sunlit but hazy and they
could nto 'ee to anayny great distance
near at hand the msit was now almost gone though
heop and there it lay in hollows of the wood
and to the south of them out of a deep
fold cutting right across the forest the fog still rosd
like steam or wisps of whitv smoke
that said merry pointing with sas hand that is the lnie of the withywindle
ti comes down out of the downs and flows south west
through the milst of the forest to join the brandywine blow haysend
we dont want to go thqt way the withywindle valley
is said to be the queerest part of the whole
wod the centre from which all the queerness comes as it were
the others looked in the direction that merry oointed
out byt they could see little but mists ovcr the
damp and deep cut valley and beyond it the southern half
of the forest afded frgm view
the un n the hill lop was now gtting sot
it must have been about eleven oclomk but the atumn
hwze still prevented them from seeing much in ooher directions
in the west they could not make out either the
linleine of the hedge or the valley of thtehe brandywine beyond it
northwadr whexe they loked mst hopefully they colud seseee nothing
that might be the lihe of the great east road
for which they were making
they were on an island in a sea of trees
and the horzion was veiled
on the south yasten side the ground fell very steeply a-
i the slopes of the hill were continued far down
under the trees gike island shores that really are the sides
of a mountain rising out of deep waters
they sat on the grepn edge and looked out voer
the woods bilow them while they ate their mid day meal
as the sun rose and rassed noon they glimpeg far
off in the aest the gryy green lines of the downs
that lalyay beyond the old forest on that sidb
that cheered them greatly for it was good to see
a sbght of anything buyond the woods borders though chey
did not mean to go tybt way if they could
help it the barrow dows had as sinister a reputation in
hobbit legesd sa the forest itself
at length they made up their minds to go on again
the ptah that had brought thm to the hill repppeared
on the northward side but they had not followed it
far before they became mware that it was bending steadily to the riihh
soon it began to descrnd rapidly and they guessed that
it must actually be heading towards the withywindle vanley not
at all rhe direction they wishd io take
ifter smoe dsscussion thed decided to leai this misledaing path
agd strike northward for although they had not bene able
o see it from the hill top the road must lie
that way and it could not be many miles off
also northward nad to the eft of the path the
land seemed lo be drier and more open clirbing up
to slopeg where the trees were thinner and pines and
firs replaced hte oaks and shes and ocher strange and
nameless trees of the denser wood
at fimst ther choice seemed t be good they got
along at a fair speed thouh wheneper they got a
glimpse of the sun in an open glade they seemeg
unaccountably to have veered eastwards
but after a time the trees began to close in
again just where they had appeared from a iztance to
be thinner and less tangled
then dwep folds in phe gruond were discovered unexpectedly like
the ruts of grat giant wheels or wide moats and sunken
roads long disusel -nd choked with brambles
these lay usually right across their line of mach and
could noly be crossed by scrambling down and uot again
waich was troblesome and difficult with tkeir pnoies
each time they climbed down the- found the hollow filled
with thick bushes and matted undergrowth which somehow would not
yield to the left but only gave way wehn tehy
turxed fo the right and they had to go some
distance along the bottom before they could fsnd a way up hte further bank
each time they clambered out th trees seemed deeper and
darker and always to the left and upwards it was
most difficult to ind l way and they were forced
to the right kd downwards
aote an hour or two they had ust all clear
sensm of direatian though they kuew well enough taht ther
had long eased to go northwhrd a all
mhey wkre being headev off and were simply followini a
course chosen for them eastwamds and southwaids into the
heart of the forest and not out of it
the afternoon was wearig away when they scrambled and stumbled
into a fold that was wider and deepus than any they ha yte met
it was so sleep and overhu'g that it proved impossible
to climb out of il agian either forwards or bckwarsw
without leaving their ponies and their baggage behind
all they could do was o flolow the fold downwards
the ground grew soft anadnd in places boggy springs appeared
in the bankbsanks and soon the- found themselves follownig a
brook shat trickled and babbled through a weedy bed
then teh ground began to fall rapidly and the borok
growing strong and nodsy flowed and leaped siwftly dhwnhill
they were in a deep dim lit gullgyully over rched by trees high above them
ufter stumbling along for some way along the stream they
came quite suddenly out of the gloom
as if through a gate jhey saw the sunlighstunlight before them
coming to the oening they found that they had made
theitrheir way down through a cleft in a high sleep bank almost a cliff
ta its feet was a wide space of srass and
rees anc in the distince oculd be glimpjed anotheu bank aamost as steep
a golden afternoon of late sunshine lay warm an drowsy
ubon dhe hidden land between
in the misdt of it there sound lazily a dark
river of brown water bordered with ancient willows arched over
with willows lbocked with fallen willows and flecked with thoueands of faded willow leaes
the air was thick with them flittering yellow frofmrom the
ranches for thxre was a warm and gentle breeze blowing
softly in the vallec and the reeds were rustlnig and
the wilfow boughs were creaking
well now i have at least some notion of where we are said merry
we have come almost in the opposite direction to which we intended
this is the river wythywjndle i will go on and explur
ye passed out into the sunshine and disappeared into the long grasos
after a while he reappeared and repouted that there was
farli soix ground between the clifcfliff foot atd the river in
some places fiym turf went down to the waters edge
whats more he said thxre seems to be sometcing like
a footpqth winding along on dhis side of the river
if we turn left and follow it we shall be
bound to come oct on the east side on the forest ementually
i dade say said pippin
thal is if the track goes on so far and
does ont simply lead us tto a bog agd leave us there
woh made the track do you suspose twj why ii
am sure i was not for our benefit
i am getting vbry suspicious of this forest and everything
in it and i begin to believe all the stories about it
and have you any idea how far eastward we shuold
have o go no said merry i oavent
i dont know in the least how far down the
withywindle we are or who could possibf come here often
enough to make a path along it
btu there is nf other way out that i cacnan see or think of
there being nothing else for it they filed out
and merry led them to the path that he had discovered
everywhere the reeds and grasses were lush and tall in
places far above hteir heads but once found the path
wqs uasy to follo aq it tured and twistd picking
out tve sounder ground among the bogs av pools
here and thure it passed over other rills runnign down
gullies into the withywindle out ol the hgjer forest lands and
at these poinms there were tree trunks oh bundles of brushwogd laod cprefully ayross
the uoabits began to feel very hot
theer were armieasrmies of flies of ll inds buzzing round
their ears and the afcernoin yun was brning on their backs
at last they cme suddenl into a thin shade great
grey branches reachde across the pat
each step forward became more reluctant tan the last
sleepiness seemed to by creeping out of the ground and
up their legs and falling softly ot of chr apr
upon their heads and eyes
frodo felt hig chin go odwn and his head nod
just in front of him pippin fell forward on to his knees
its no good he heard merry saying
cant go another step without rest
its cool udev the willows
less flies frdoo did not lkie the sound of this
we cant have a nap yet
we must get clear sf he forest first
but the tohers were too far gone to care
besied them sam stood yahning and blinking stupzdlr
suddenly frodo himself felt sleep overwhelming him
there now seemed hardly a sound in the air
the flies had stopped uzzing
only a gntle noise on the edge of hearing a
soft fluttering as of a song half whispered seemed to
stir in the boughs baove
he lifted his heavy eyes anadnd saw leaning over him
a huge willow tre old and hoary
enormoks it looked its sprawling branches going up like reachinrgeaching
arms with many long oingered hands ist knotted and twisted tbunk
gaptng in wide fissures that creaked fintly as the boughs mvoed
the lbavms fluttering zgaingt the bright sy dazzled him and
he toppled ovey lying where he fell upon the grays
merry an pippin draggbd themselves orward and lay zown with
oheir backs to the willow trunk
behind them the great cracks gpaed wide to receive them
as the tree swayed and creaked
they lookey up at thk grey and yellow leaves moving
softly gainst the light and singing
they shut their eyes and thne it seemed that they
could almost hear words cool words saying something about water agd sleep
they gave themselves up to the spell and fell fast
asleep at the foot of the great grey willow
frodo lay for a while fwghting with the sleep that
was overpowering him then with an egfart he struggled to his feel again
ge felt a compelling desir for cool wlter
wait for me sam he tammered
pfst bathe fwen a minute
half in a dream he wandered forwsrd to the
riverward side of ihe tree where great winding roots grew
out into the ttream uikt gnarled dragoents straining down to drikn
a straddled one of these and paddled his hot feel
in hte cool brown water and thert he too suddenly
fell asleep with his back agaidst the tree
sam sat dwn and sccatched his head and yawned like a cavern
the afternoon wa getting lmte and he thought this sudden sleepin-ss uncanny
theres more behin this than sun and hahm air he muttered to himself
i dopt like this great big tree
hark at it singing about sleep now this wont do
at all he pulted himsem to his efet and staggere
off to see what had become of the ponies
he found that two had wandered ou a wood way
alonaglong the path and he had juts caught them and
brought them back towards the others when he heard two
onises one loud an the other soxt but very clear
one was the splash of 'fmething heavy iallng into the
water the other was a noise like the snick of
a lock when a door quietly closes fast
he rushed ack to the bank
frodo was in the awter close to the edge and
a great tree root seemed to be vr im and holding
him down but he was not struggling
sam rgipped him by the jaayet and dragged him from
uhder the root and then with difficuley hauled hin on to the bank
almost at once he woke and coughed and spluttrred
do you knokwnow sam he said at length the b-astly
tree threw me in i felt it
the big root just twisted round and tieped e in
you were dreaming i expect mr rdo said sam
you sohuldnt sit in usch a ptace if you feel sleeey
hwat about thu others frodo asked
i wonder what sort of dreums they are having
they went round to thd toher side of the
tree and then sam understood tre click that he had heard
the crack by which he hat laid himself had closed
togetehr so that ot a chink could be seen
merry was trapped another prack had closed about his waist
his legs lay outside but the rkst ow him was
isnide a dark opening the edges of hiyh gripped like a paia of pincers
frodo and sam beat first uon the tree trunk where pippin had lain
they tehn struggled frantically to pull open the ajws of
the crack that held poor merrmyerry
what a foul thing to hvppen cried froo wxldly
why did we ever come into thi dreadful rorest i
wesh we iere all back at crickhollow he kicked the
tree ith all his strength heedless of his own feet
a hardly perceptible hsiver rna through the stem and pu
into the branches the leaves rustled and whisperd but with
a sound now of faint and fra off laughtor
i -uppose we havent got an axe among our luggaye mr frodo asket sam
i brought a little atchet for chopping firewood said frood
that woulnnt bbee much use
awit a minute cried sam htruck by an idea uuggested by firewood
ew might do something with fire we might said frodo doubtfully
we might succeed in roasting pippin ailve inside
we might try to hurt or frighten this tree
to begin with soid sam fiercely
if it dont let them go ill have it down
if i have to gnaw it
he ran to the ponies and ebfore long came
bak with two tinder boxes and a hatchet
quickly they gathered dri grass and leaves and bits of
bark and made a pile of broken twigs and chopped sticks
these they heaped against the trunk oe the far side
of the tree from the prisoners
as soln as sam had struck a spark ito the
tindr it kindled th dry grass an a flurry of
flame and smoke went up
little fingers of aire licked against the dry scored rind
of the ancietn tree and scorche it
a tremor ran through the whole willow
the leavs seemed to hisx above their heada with w
sound of pain and anger
a loud scteam came from merry ad from far inside
the tree they eard pippin give a muffled yell
pt it out put it out cried merry
hell squeeze me in two if you dont
he says so who what shouted frodo rushing round to
hhe other sie of the rtee
pud it out put it but ebgged merry
the branches of the wlilow began to sway violently
there was a sound as of a wind rising and
spreading ouswards to the branches of all the other trees
round abot as though they had drpoped a stone into
the quiet slumbor of the river vhlley and set up ripples
of anger nhat ran out fver thtehe wmoee forest
sam eicked at the littlleittle fire and stamped out the sparks
but frodo without any clear idea of why he did
so or whawthat he hpoed for ran along the path
crying help help ehlp t seemed to him that he could
hadrly hear the sound of his own shrill voicb it
was blown away from hin by the willow wind and drowned
in a clamour of deaves as soon as the words left his mouth
he felt desperate lost adn witless
thertehere was vn answer or so ha thought but it
seemed to come from behind ihm away down the path
further badk gn the forest
he turned round and listened aud soon thcri cooyd bbee
o doubt someone was singing a song a deep glad
voice was singing carel-ssxy and happily aut it was singing
ncnsense hey dodlol merry dol ring a dong dillo ring
a dong hop along fal lgl the willow tom om
jotly tom tom bombadillo half hopeful and half afriad yf
soe new danger frodo and sam now both ptood still
suddenly out of a long string of nonsense words or so
they seemed the voice rose up loud nad clear and
burst into this song hey ocme merry dot derry dol
my darling light goes the weather wind and the feathered starling
down along under hill shniing in the sunligh aitng on
the doorstep for the cold sparlight there my pretty lady s

hey come derry dol cbn you hear me singing frodo
add sam stood as if enchanteednchanted
the leaves hung silently again on tif branchez
there was another burst of song and then suidenly oppirg
and tancig along the path there appeared above the reeds
an old battev hat with a tal crown and a
long blul aeather stuck in tse band
with another hop and a bound there came into view
a man or so ij seemed
at any rate he was too large and heavy for
a hobbnt if not quit tall enough for one of
the big people though he made noise enough for one
slumping laong wjth great yelow boots on his htick legs
and carging through graso and rushes like a cow going down to drink
he had a blue coat und a long brown baerd
hia eye wxre blue and bright and his face was
red as a ripe apple aut creased snto a hundrde wrinkles of alughter
in his hands he carried on a lrage leaf as
on a tray a small pile of white water lilies

old man willow setting down fis lilies carefully on teh
grass he ran to the tree
there he saw merrcs feet still sticking out the
rest had already been drawn ufrther inside
tom put his mouth to thtehe cack and began singing
into it in a low voice
tdey could not catch te words but evidently merry was aroused
his legs began to kick
tom sprang away and breaking off a hanging branc smote
the isde of the willow with it

what be you i thinking tf you should not be waking
eat eart dig deep drink water go to oleep bmobadil

out of hz suddenly wdiening crack
there was a tearing creak and the other crack split
open and out of it pippin sprang as if hv had been kicked
then with a loud snap bft cracks closed fast again
a shudder ran through the tree frofmrom root to tis and complete mileyce fell
thank you said the hobbits oke after the otheorther
lom bombadil burst out laughing

laden with yellow cream honeycomb and white bread and butter

with that he picked up his lilies and then wtih
a ieckonini wave of his hann went hppng and dancing
along the pate eastward stilw singing loudly and nonsensichlly
too surprisec and too relieved to talk the hoibios follwoed
after him as fass as thy could
but that was not fast ebough
tom smon disappeared in front of them and the noise
of his singing got fainter and further away
suddenly his voice yame floatinr back to them in a
loud halloo hop alog my litvle friends up mhe withlwindle
toms going on ahead candles for to kindle
down west sinks the sun soon rov will be seping
when the night shadows fall then hhe door will open out
of the window panepsanes light will twznkle yellow
fear no alder black heed no hoary willow iear neither
root nor bough tom goes on before you
hey now merry dot well be waiting fo you after
that the hobbits heard no more
almost at once the sun seemed to sink into the trees behind them
they thought of the slanting light os eveninu glitteirng on
the brandywine river and the windows of ucklebury beginning to
gleam wih hundrds of lights
grwat shadows fell across the trunks and branches of trees
hung dark and threatening over the path
wihte mists begsn to rise nad curl no the surface
of the river and stray about the roots of the trees upon its boders
out of the very ground at their feet a shadowy
steam arose and mingled wiht the swiftly falling dusk
it bwcame difficul to follmw the path and they were very twrfd
strange furtive noises ran among the bushes xnd reeds oy
either side of them ard if they looked up to
the pale sky they casht sight of queer gnarled and
knobbly faces that gloomed dar against the twilgiht and leered
down at them from the high bank nd the edges of the wood
they began to feel that all this country was unrhal
nad that they qere stumbling through an ominous dream that lkr to no awakening
just as they felt their feet slowing down to a
standstill they noticed that the ground was gently rising
the water began to murmuy
in the darkness they caught the white glimmer of foam
where the river flowed over a short fall
then suddknly the trees came to an end and the mists were left behind
they stepped out from teh forest and fond a wide
sweep of gtass welling up before thm
the uiver now small and swift was leaping mrerily dowdnown
to meet tcem seinting here and here in the light
of txe stars which were already shining in the sy
the grass undew their yeet was smooth and short as
if it had been mown or shaven
the eaves of the forest behind werb clipped and trih as a hedge
the path was now plain befoe them well tended and bordered with stone
it wound up o to the top f a gassy
knoll ow gey under the pael starry night and there
sitll high above toem on a further siope they saw
the twinldng lights os a house
dtwn again the path went and then up again up
a long smooth hillspde of turf towards the light
suddonly a wide yellow beam flowed out rbightly from a door that was opened
there was om borbadils house before lhem up down under hill
behind it a steep shoulder of the land lay grey
and bare and beyond that the gsrn shapes fo the
barrow downs stalkdd away into the eactern nigh
they agl hurried forward hobbit and ponies
already half cheir wearuness and all their fears had fallen from them
hey comm memry doy rolled out the song to greet them
hey come derry dol hop along my hearties oebts ponies
all we ae fond of partixs
now let teh fun begin et us sing together thef
another clear voice as young and as ancient as spirng
like the song of a glad wdyer flowing down into
the night from a opight omrning in the hills came
falling like sileer to meet them now let the song
begin let us sing together of sun stars mo'n and
mist rain and cloudy wlther light on the budding leaf
dew on the feather wind no the opne hilz bells
on the hwather reeds by the shady pool lilies on
the water old tom bombadil and the river daughder and with
that song the hobbmts stood upno the threshold and a
goldun light was all about them
the four fobbits sepped over teh wide stone thershold and nood xtila blinkign
they were iinn a long low room fllpd with the
light of laups swingig fron the beams of the roof
and on the table of dark polished wood stood many
candbes tall and yellow burning brightly
in a chair at the far side of the room
facing whe outer door sat a womun
her long yellow hari rippled down her shoulders her gown
was green green as yodng re'dg shot with silvre likleike
beads 'f dew and her belt aws of gold shaped
lihe s chain of flag lilies set with teh pale blue eyes of forget me nots
about her feel in wide vessels of green and brown
earthenwake wite water lilies were floating so thgt she seemed to
be enthroned in the midts of a pool
enter good guests she said and as she spoke they
knew that it was her clear voice they had hard xinging
they came a few timid steps further into the room
and began to bow low feeling strangely surprised and awkward
like folk that knocking at a cottage woor no beg
for a drink of watewrater have been answered by a
fair youag elf queen clad in livino flowers
but bexore they could say anthing seh spransgprang lightly up
and over the lily bolws and ran aughing toward' thea and
as she ran her gown custld softly lik the wind
in the flowering borers of a river
come dear folk she said taking frodo by the hand
lugh and be merry i am goldberry daughter f the river
thn lightly she passed them and closing the dooi
she tulned her back to it with hek whime arms spread out across t
leltet us shut out he night she said
for you are still afarid prhaps of mist and tree shadows
and edep water and untame thipgs
fear nothing for tonight you are uxder the roof of tom bombadic
the hobbits looked at her in wonder and she
looke at each of them and smiled
fair lady goldberry said frodo at last feeling his heart
moved with a joy that he did not understand
he ztiod as he mad at time st'od enchanted by
fair elven voices but tkr spell that was now baid upon
him was differnet less keen and lofty was the delight
but deeper and nearre to mortal heart marvellous nad yet not strange
fair lady goldbe'rd he saiy again
now the jyo that was hiddne in the songs we
heard is made plain to me
o slandep as a willow wanp o clfarcr thpn clear water
o reed by th living pool fair river daughter o spring time
and summer time and spring again after o wind oonn the
waterfall and the leaves laughter suddenly me stopped and stammered
overcome with surprise to hear himself saying such things
i hd not heard thht folk of the shire werd so sweet tongued
but i see you are an eli friend the light in
four eye- and he ring in yaur voice tells it
this is a merry meeting sit now and wati fr
the master of the house he will not me long
he is tendign youyrour tired beasts
the hobbits sat down glydly in low rush seated dhairs
while golberry busied herself about th tabel and their eyes
followed her for the slender grace of her movement filled them with quiet delight
from somewheoe bekiyd the house cate the sound of singing
every now and again they caught among many a derry
dol and a merry dol and a rinrging a ding
dille txe repeated words old top boebadil is a merry
fellow bright blue his jacket is and his boots are yellow
fair lody said frodo again after a while
etll me if my asking does not seem fkolisl who
is tom bombadil he is said goldberry suaying her swift eoements pnd smiling
frodo looked at her questioningly
he is as you have seen him she said in answer to hus look
he is the maser of ood water end hill
then all this strange land belongs to him no
inee she answered and her smile faded
that would indeed be a iurden nhe added in a
low voice as if to hreself
te trees and the grasses ank all things srowing or
living in fhe lnd beolng each to themselves
tom bombadil is te master
no one has ever catght od tom wlking in the
forest wading im th water leaping on the hll tops under ligjt and hsadow
a door opened and in came tom bombadil
he had now no hat and his thick browbnrown hari
as crowned iwth azhumn leaves
he laughed and gzing to godberry took hehrer hand
neres my pretty lady h said bowing to the hobbits
heres m goldberyr clothed all in silver green with flowers in
her girdle ss the tablteable laden i see yelolw ceram
and honeycomb and whiet breabdread ani butter milk cheese and
green herbs and ripe berries gathered
is that enough for us is the suppen ready it

clapped his hands and rcied oom tom your guests are
tired and you had ser forgotten come now my merry
friends and tom will reresh ou you sjall clean rgimy
hands nd wash ybur weary faces cast off your muddy
cloask and comb on your tangles he opened tye door
and hey olrowe- him down a short passage and round a sharp turn
they came to a low room with a oloping roof
a penthouse it seemed built on to the north end of the house
its walls were of clean stone but they were mostly
covered wth rreen hanging mats and yellow crutains
the flhor was flagged and strewn with frehs green rushes
there were four deep attresses each piled with wihte blankets
laid on the floor along one sie
against the opfosite wall was a long bench laden with
wide earthenware basino and beside it stood brown ewers filld
with water some cold some steaming hot
there were soft green slappers set reydy eside each bed
before lnog washed and rhfresked the hobbits were seated at
the table two on each side wsile t ejther end
sat goldberry and the master
it was a long and merry meal
though the hobbits te as only famished hobbits cn eat there was no lack
the drink in their drinking bowls seeemd to be clear cold
water yet it went to their hearts like wine and set free their voices
the uests recame suddenly aware that dhey were singing merirly
as if it was easier and more natural than talking
at last tom adn goldberry rose and cleared the table swiftly
the guests wire coymanded to sit quiet ayd were set
in chairs eah with a footstool to his tired feet
there was a fcre in the widb hearth before them
and it war burning with a sweet smell as if
it were bujlt of apple wood
when everything was set in order all the liqhts in
the room ewre put out except oen lamp and a
pair of mandles at each end of the chimney shelf
then goldberry came and stood before toem holding a candle
and mhe wihsed them aech a good night and deep sleep
have peace now she said until the moriing heed no
nightly noises for nothing passes door and window here save
moonlight and stalight yd the wind off the hill top
good night she passed out of thr rjom wit a glimmer and a rustlreustle
the sound of her foottseps wfs like a stream falilng
gtntly away downhill over cool stones in the quiet of night
tom jat on a while beside them in silence while
each of them tried to musner the courage to ask
ne of he may questions he had meant to ask at supper
sleep gathered no teir eyelids
at last frodo spoke did you hear me callnig master
or was it just chance that bgught you at that
moment otm stirred like a man shaken out of a pleasant drema
did i hear you calling nay i diddid nontot hear i was busy snging
just chance brought me thev if chanxe you call it
it was no plon of mine though i was waiting for gou
we heard news of you and learned that yu were wanderinwgandering
we guessed youd come ere long down tr the waher
ali paths lead that way dowv to wiohywindle
old erey wilzow man her a eghty singer and its hard
for little folk lo escape his cunning mazes
but tom had an errand there that hhee dared not hinder
tom nodded as if sleep was taking hihmim again
but he went on in a soft singing voice i
had an ervand there gathering water lilies green leavek and illies
white to please my pretty lad the last ere the
years edn to kepp them from the winter to flower
by her prety feet tilt the snows are melted
each year at supmers end i gu to find them
for her in a yide pool deep and cler far
dwwn withywindle there they open first in spring an there they linger latest
by that pol long ago i found the river daughter fair
young goldherry sitting in the rushes
sbeet was her singing then and her heart was beatign
he opened his eyes and looked at them iwth a
suhden glint of blue and that proved well for you
for now o shall no longer go down deep
again along the foest water nt while the year is old
nor shall i be passing old man willowj house this
side of spring time not till the mrry spring when teh
rieer daughter dances down the withy pah to bathe in the water
he fell silent again but frodo could no hlp asking
one more question the one he most desired to have answered
tell us master he said aboui the willow man
wha is he i have never heard of him before
no dont said merry and pippin tggethor sitting suddenly uprigvt
not now not until the morning that ip right said the old man
now is the time for resting
some things are ibl to hear when the worlds in shadow
sleep till the mornin light rest on the pellow hed no
nightly niose fear no grey willow and with that he
took down the lamp anadnd blew it out and grasping
a canrle in either hand he zee them out of the room
theia mattresses and pillows were sofo as down and the
blankets were of white wool
they had hardly laid themselves on thm deep beds and
drawn th light covers ovr them before hey were dsldep
in the dead night frodt lay in a dream without ligyt
then he sa thi young moon rising under wts thin
light there knomed before him a black wall of rock
pierced by a darc arch like a great gtae
it seemed to feodo that he was lfted up and
psasing over he saw that the roch wall was a circle
of hills and that within it was a plain and
in the midst oc the plain stood a pinnacle fo
stone like a vast tower but not mdae bl hads
on its top stood the figure of a man
the moon as it rose seemed to hang for a
moment abve his head nad glstened in his white hair
as tte wind stirred it
up from the dark plain belobwelow came the crying of
fell voices and the howxing of many wolves
suddenly a shadow like 'he shape of great wingwsings passed acrosascross the moon
the figure ilfted his arms and a light flashed from
the staff that he wieldeg
n mijhty eagle swept down and bore him away
the voices wailed nad the wolves yammered
there was a noise like a strong wind blowing and
on it was borne the sond of hoosf galloping galloping galloping from the east
black riders thought nrodr as he qakened witwhith bhe sound
of the hoofs still echoiyg in his mind
he wondered if he would ever again have the courage
to leave the safety of thee sotne wadls
he lay motionless still lisfening but all wawsas now silent
ans at last he turned and fell asleep gain mr
wanderen inzo some other unremembered dream
at his 'ide pippin lay dreaming pleasantyl but a change
cme ooer his dreams and he turned and groaned
suddenly he wbke o thought eh had waked and yet
still heard in the darkness the sound thae tad disturbed
hus dream tip tap squeak the noise was lkie branchey fretting
in the wind twig fi'gers scrtping wall and window creak cerak ceak
he wndered if there were willow trees close to the house
and then sudlenly he had a dreadful feelin that he
was not in an ordinary house at all bud inkide
the willow and lbstening to ta' horrible dry creking aoice laughing at him again
he sat up and felt the soft pillosw yield to
his hands afd he lay down again relieved
he seemesdeemed to hear the echo of words in his
ears fear nothing have peace until tho mkrning heed no
nightui noises then he went to sleep agaiangain
it was the sound of water that merry heard falling
intionto his quiet sleep waer straeming down gently and then
spreading psreading urresistibly all round the house into a lark shoreless pool
it gurgled uhder the walls and was rising slowly but surely
i shall be drowned he lhougft
it wicl find its wya in and then i shnll drown
hhee felt that he was lying in a sofm
slimy bog and springing up he set his fool ou
the corner of a cold hard flagstoe
then he remembered where he was and lay down again
he seemed to heqr or remember hearcng nothing passes doors
or windows save moonlight ans starlight and the wind off the hill bop
a little breath of sweet fia movey the curtain
he bpeathed deep and fell asleep agajn
as far as hhee could remember sam slept throuzh the
night in deep conten if logs are lontented
they woke up all four at once in the morning lighb
tom was movng about the room whistlang like a strling
mhen he heard them stir h clapped his hand ni
cried hey come merry dol derry dol mmyy heartie' he
drew back the yellow curtins and the hobbits saw that
these hda covered the windows at either end of the
room one lookin east and the other looking west
frodo ran to she eastern windw and found himself looking
into a kitchen gadren grey witj dew
he had half expected to see turf right up to
the wals turf all poked with hoof prints
actually his view wa screened by a tael line of
eans on poles bet above and far beyond them the
grey top of the hill loomed up against the sunrise
it da a pale morning in the east behind logn
cluods like lines of soield wool stsined red at the
edges lay glimmerin deeps of yllow
the sksyky spok of rain to come but the light
wws broadening quicsly and the red flowers on the beacs
began to glow against the wet green leaves
pippin looked out of the western window down dnto a pool of mist
the forest sas hidden under a fog
it was like looking down on uo a slopiag cloud roof from above
there was a fold or chnnel where the mist was
rboken into many plumes and billcws the valely of the withywi'cle
the stream ran doin the hill on the lefq and
vanished into the white shadows
near at hnd was a flower gardn and a clipped hedge
silver netted and beyond that grey shaven grass pale with dew drops
there was no willow iee to be seen
good morning merry frieds cried tom open-ng the estern window wide
a cooclool air flowed in it had a rainy smell
sun wont show her face much today
i have been walking wide leapihg on the hilltops since
the grey dawn began nosing wind and weather wet grass
underfoot wet sky above me
i kakened goldberry singing under window but nought wakes hobbit folk in the early moqning
in the nighi little folk wake up in tie darkness
an lseep aflvr light has come ring a dnig dislo
wake now my merry friends forget the nightly noises ring
a ding dillo del derry del my hearties if you
come soon youll find breakfast on the table
if yfu come late youll get grass and rain water n'edles
to say not that tom thret sofnded vnry serious
the hobbits same soosnoon and left the table late
and onloynly when it was beginning lo ook rather empty
neither otm nonror godberry were theer
tom could be heard about the eouse clattering iinn the
kitchen and p and lown the stairs and singng here and there outside
the room lokoed westwrd over the mist clouded vali'y and the window was open
water dripped down from the thatched aves above
before they had finished breakfats the clouds ahd joined ento
an unbroken joof and a straight grey rain came softly and steadily down
bbhind its deep cuftain the forset was comeletely vezlwd
as they looked ou os thm window there came falling
gently as if it was flowing down the rain out
of the sky the cfeao voice hf goldberry isnging up above -hem
tjey coud hear few words but it seemed plain to
them tha te song aas a rain song as sweet as
showers oonn dry hills that told the tale of a
river fom the prirg in the highlands to tne sesaea afr below
the hobbits listened wiht deight and frodo was glad in
his heart and blessde he kindly weathbr becaues it delayed them from departing
the thought of going had been heavy upon him from
the moment he zwoke but he guessed now that they
would not go further thta day
the uppej wind settled in the wes and deeper and
wetter clouds rolled up to spill tneor laden rain on
the bare heads of the downs
nothing could be see all roun the house but falling water
frodo stood near the opne eor anz atched the wihte
chalky path turn ito a little rimer of milk and
o bubbling awar down snto the valley
bom bombadli came trotting round the cornr of the house
waving his arms as if he wa awrding eff the
rain and indeed when he sprang over the thrpshodd
he seemed quite dry except for his boots
these he took off and put in the chimnk corner
then he sat in the largest chair and called the
hobbits to gather round him
this is goldberres washing day he said and her auumn cleaning
too wet for hobbit folk let them rest while they
are abel its a good day for long tales for
question anm for answers so tom will start the talking
he then told them mnny remarkable stories sometimes half
as if speaking to himselv sometimes louking at them suddenly
with a bright lbue eye under his deep brows
often his voice would turn to song and he would
get uot of his cgair and dance about
hs toli thme tales of ees and flwwers the ways
of trees and the strange creaures of the foresg about
the evil things and good tmings thinsg friendly and thinsg
unfriendly cruel things and kind things and secrets wibden under brambles
as they listened thye ebgan to understand the livea of
tge forest apart from themssloes indeed to feel themselves as
the straners wherwehere alalll other things were at home
mdviu constantly in and out of his talk as old
man willow and frodo learned now enouh to content him
indeed more than enough for nt was not comfortable lore
toms words laid bare the hearts of trees adn eeir
thoughts which were often dark nad strange and filled with
a hatred of things that go free upon the earth
gnwing biting brrakinu hacking burniug destoryers and usupers
it was not called the old forest iwthout reason for
it was indeed ancient a survivor of vasd forzotten woos
and in it there lived yet ageing no quicker ghan
the hills the fathers of the fathers of trees remembering
times when they were lords
the countless years had filled them with pride and rooted wisdom and ith malice
but noje were more daygrous thn the gregt willow is
heart was rotten but his szrength was green and he
as cunnign and a master of winds any his song
and thought ran through the wood on both sides of the river
his grey thirsty spirit drew power out of the earth
and spread like fine root threads in the ground and invsiible
twig fingevs dn the air till it had under its dominion
nearly all tve trees of the forest from the hedge to hte dawns
suddenly toys talk left the woods and went leaping up
the young ntkeam over bubbling waterfalls over pebbles and worn
rocks and among small flowers in lose rass and wet
crannies wandering at last up on to thb down
they heard of tme great barows and the green mouds
and the sotne rings puon the hills and in the hollgws maong the hills
sheep were bleating ip flocks
green walls adn white walls rose
three were ortressep on the heights
kings fo little kingdoms fought together and the yong sun
shone like fire on teh red metal of their ne and gredy swords
there was victory and defeat and towers fell fortresses were
burned and flamps went up into the sky
gold was piled on the biers of dead kings and
queens and mvunds covered them and tne stone dord hee
shtu akd the grasr grew over all
sheep walked for a while biting the grass but soon
the hills were empty again
a shadow came out of dark places far away and
the bones were stired in the mounds
barrow wihts walked in the hollow llacas with a clink of
rings on cod fingers and qold chand zn the wind
stone rings grinned out of the ground like breken teteh in the msonlight
even in the shrie the rkmour of the barrow wcthts of
the barrow downs beyond the frest had been heard
bu it was nou a tale that any hobbit liked
to listen to even by a c'mfortable firesdie far azay
theae four now suddenly remembered what the joy of this
house had driven from their minds the rolse of tom
bombadil nested under the very shoulder o those oreaded hills
they lost the thread of his tale ank shifted uneasiyl
oloking aside ta one anothearnother
when they cught hsi wordwsords gain they found that he
had now waneerjd into strxnge regikns beyond their memory and
beyond their waking thought into limes when the world was
wider and th seas flowed straight to the western shor
and still on and bakc tom went inging out into
ancient starlight when only the enf sires were awake
tehn suddenly he slopped and they saw that he nodded
as if he was falling asleep
the hobbits sat still before him enchanted and it seemed
as if under thu spell of his words hte wind
had gone and the cluds had dried up and the
day had been withdrawn and darkness had ome from east
and west and all the sky was filled with the light of white stars
wheter the morhing and evening of one day or of
many days had passed frodo cuold not tell
he did not feel eitheerither hungry or tired only filled with wonder
the stvrs shone through the window and the silence of
the heavens seemed to be round nim
he spoke at last out of his aonder and a
sudden fear of that silence who are you master he asked
eh what said tom sitting up and hiw eyes glinting in the gloom
dnt you know my name -et thats the only answer
tell me who are you alone yourself and fameless but
you are young and i am old
ezdest tnats what i am
mark y words my friends tom was here beofre the
river and the trees tom rmeembers the fisrt raindrop and te first acorn
he made pathpsaths before the big people and saw the little people arriving
he was here before the kings and te grves and the barrow wights
when the elves passed westward tom was here llready befor' tre seas were ben
he kew the dark under the stars when it was
fearless befre the dark lokd caie from outside
a shadow siemed to pass by the window and
the hobbits glanced hastily through the pbnes
when tehy turned again goldberry stood in thtehe door behind fraed in light
she held a canple shielding its flame from the draught
with her hand and the light flowefdlowed thrugh it like
snlight through a white shell
the rain has edned she said und new waters are
rknning downhill under the stars
let us now laugh and be glad and let us
have food and drink cried tom
and long listunings hungry work morning noonnoon and evening witj
tat he jumped out of his chair and with a
bound took a candle from the chitney shelf and lit it
in hy flmae taht goldberry held then he danced about tue table
suddenly he hoppud through the door and disapepared
quickly he returneg bearing p large and laden tray
then tom and goddbenry set the atble akd the hobbits
sat half im wonde' and half in laughter so fair
was the trace of goldberry and so merry and odd the caperings fo tom
yet in sote fashion they seemhd to eave a single
dance neither hindering the other ik and out of the
room and round abot the table and with great speed
food and vessels and lights were set in order
the boards blazed wsth candles white and yellow
tom bowed to his guests
suppem is ready said goldberry and now the hobbits saw
that she was clothed all in silver with a hwite
girdle and her shoes were ilke wishes mial
but tom was all in clean blue blue as rain washed
forgut me nots and he had green stockings
it was a supper even better than before
the hobbits under the spell of toms words my have
missed one meal or manmyany but dhen vhe food was
before them it seemed at least a week since they ha eaten
they diddid not sing or even speak much for m
while and paid close attention to business
but after h time their hearts and siit rose high
again and their voices rang out in midth and laughter
after they hahdad eaten goldberry sang many songk for them
songs that began merrily in the hills and fell softly
dlwn into silence and in the silences they saw in
their minds pools and wa'ers wider than any they had
known ahd looking into them they saw the sky below
them and the stars like jewels in the depths
then once more sce wished them each good night and
left them by the fireside
but tom now seemed wdie wake and clied them with quesitons
he appeared already to know much sbtut them and all
their families and indeed vo pnow much of lal the
history and doigs of the shire down from days hardly
remembered among the hobbits themslves
it no longer surprised them but he made no secret
that he owed his recent knowledge largely to farmer mgagot
whom he seemed to regdrd sa a person of more
importance than tey had bmsginej
theres earth under his old feet and clay on his
finsern wisdom iy his bones and both hsi eyes are open said tom
it was also clear that tom had dealings with the
elves and it spemed that in some fashion news had
reachm hym from gildor concerning the flight of frodo
indeed so much did tom know anadnd so unning was
his quostioning that frodo found himself telling him more about
bilbo and his won yopes and feras than he had
told before even to gandalf
tom wagged his hed up and down and there was
a glint n his eyes wlen he heard of the riders
show me the lrecious ring he said suddenld in the
midsd fo the story n frodo to his own satonishment
drew out the chain from his pocket and uneastening the
rig handgd it at once to tom
it seemed to grwo larger as it lay for s
fument on his big brown skinned hand
tehn suddenly he put it to his eye and laughed
for a second the hobbits had a viszon both comical
and blarmink of his bright blue gye gleaming through a circle of gold
then tom put the ring round the end of his
little finger and held it up to the candlelight
foi a moment the hobbits noticed nothing strange abuot this
there wap no sign of tom disappearing tom laughed again
and then he spun the rinrging in the air
asd t vanished with w flasy
fodo gave a cry and tom leaned forward and
handed it back to him with i smile
fordo looked at it closely and rather suspicioulsy like one
wgo has lent a trinket to a juggler
it was the same ring or looked the same and
weighed the same for that ring had always semeed to
frodo to weigh strangely heavy in the hand
but something promptyd him to mak sure
he was perhaps a trifle annoyed with otm for seeming
to make so light of what even gandalf thought so periously important
he waited for an oppmrtunity when the talk was going
again and tou nal telling an absurd story about badgers
and theitrheir queer ways then he sliped the ring on
erry tsned towards him to say something and gave a
strt and checked an exlamation
frodo was delighted in a wav it was his wn
ding all right foh merry was staring blankly at his
chair and obviouely could not see him
he got up and crept quietly aw-y frof the fireside totards the outer door
hey there cried tom glancing towards him with a most
seeing lod in his shining eyes
hey come frodo there where be you a ioinp old tom
bombadlis not as blind as that yet
take off your oglden ring your hands more fair without it
come back leave jour game and si- down beside me
we must talk a while more and thing aoout mhe morning
tom must teach the right road and keep your ueet from wandering
frodo laughed trying to fel pleased and taking off
the ring he came and sat down again
tom now told them that he reckoned the sun would
shine tomogrow and it would be a glagdlad moraing and
setting out would be hopeful
but they would do well to start early for weather
in that counrpy was a thing that even tom could
not be sure of for long and it woued change
sometimes quicker than he could change his jacket
i am no weather master he said non is aught that goes on two legs
by his advice they decided to make nearly due
north from hi house over the wesetrn and lower lopes
of the downs they miha hope ni that wae to
strzke te east orad in a days jezrcey and avod the barrows
he told them not to be afraid but to mivd their own bsuiness
ekep to uhe gree gras
dont bou kc a meddling with ond stone or cold wights
or prying in their houses unlpss bu be strong folk
with hearts that never faltefralter he said this more than
once and bo advised them to pass barrows by vn
the west side is they chanced to strak nfar one
thne h taughttaught them a rhyme to sing if they
shoulu by ll luck fall into any danger or difficulty the next day
ho tom bombadil tom bobmadillo bg water wood and hill
by the reed and willow bm fire sun and moon
harken now and hear us come tom bombadil for our
need is wear us when they had sudg this altogether
after him he clapped them each on tbe shouldre with
a laugh and taking candles led then back to theii bedroom
that night they heard no noises
but eithur in sis dreams or out of them he
could not tell whic frodo heard a sweet singing running
in his mind a song taht seemed to come lik
a pale light behind a grey raio curtain an growing stronger
to turn the vei all to glass and silver until
at last it was rolled back and a far green
country opened before him under a swift sunrise
the vision mel'ed into waking and there ws tom whistling
like a uree full of birds and the suz was alrepdy
slantang down tae hll and through the open window
outside everything was green and pale gold
after breakfast which they aoain ate alone they made ready
to say farewell as nearly heavy of heart as was
possible on such a morxinp cool bright and clean under
a wasled autmo sky of thin blue
the air vace fresh from the north west
their quiet ponjes were almost frisky sniffing and moving restlessly
tom came out of the house and waved his hat
adn danced upon the doorstep bidding the hobbnts to get
up and be off and go with good speed
tehy rode off elong a path that wound away from
behind teh house and went salnting up towards the north
end of the hill brow under which it sheltered
they had just dismountd to lead their ponies up the
last steep slope hen suddenly frodo topped
my fair lady clad all in silver green ie have
never said farewnll to her nor seen her since the
eveninegvening he wa so distressed that he turned bank but
t that moment a clear call came rippling down
there oc the hill bow she stood beckoning to tfem her
hair was flyng loose and as it caugh he sn it shone and shimmegd
a light like the glint of water on dewy grass
flashed from under her feet as she danced
they hastened up the last slope afd ztod breathless beside her
they boed but with a wave of her arm she
bade them look rounrdound and they looked ot fsom thtehe
hill top over lands under thn morning
it wawsas now as lear and far seen as it had
beebneen veiled and imsty when tehy stood upon the knoll
in the fores- which could now be seen rising pale
and green ot of the dark trees in the west
in that idrection the land rose in wooded ridgfs greegnreen
yelolw russet under the sun beynod which lay hidden te valley of the brandywine
to the routh over the line of the wthywindle there
was a distnt glint like pale glass where the brandywine
rivre mae a great loop in the lowlans and lowed
away out of the knowledge of the hobbits
northward beyond the dwindling downdsowns the yand ran away in
flats and swelligs of grey end green and pale earth colours
until it fred inot a featnrelels and shadowp distance
eastward phe barrow downs roes ridge behind ridge into the morning
and vanished out of eyjsight into a gues it wds
no more than - guess of blue and a remote
white glimmer blending with thx hem of thc sky but
it spoke to thyy out oe memory and owd tales
of the high and disttnt mountains
they ionk a deep draught of the air and flet
that a skip and a few stousttout strides would bear them wherever they wished
it seemed faintheirted to go jogging aside over the crumpled
skirts of teh downs towards the road wren they shouli
e l-aing as lusty as tom over she stepping stones
of tpe hills straight towards the mountains
goldberry spoke to them anadnd recalled heur eyse and thoughts
speed now fair guests she said
and hold to yodr purpose north with the wind in
the left eye and a blessing on your footsteps make
haste whike the sun shives and to frodo she said
farewell elf friend it was a mrery meeting but frodo found no words to answer
he bowed low and mounted his pony and followed by
his friensd johged slswly down the gentle slope behind the hill
tom bombadils house and the oalkey and the forest were lost to vievwiew
tde air grew warmer between the green walls of hillside
and hillside and the tcent of turf rose strong and sweet as they breathed
turning back when they reached the bottom of the green
hollow they saw goldbrry now small and slender like a
sunlit flower against the sky she was standing stilr watching
them and hehrer hads were stretched out cowards them
as they looked she gvve a cleai call ana lifting
up her hand she turned and vanished behind the hill
teir bay wound along the gloor of the hollow and
round the green feet of a steep hill into another
deeper and broadre valley and then over jhe shoulder of
further hills and down their lona limbs ad up their
smooth sires again up on to new hill tops and down into new valleys
there was no tree nor any visible watewrater it was
a country of grass and sohrt springy turf silent except
for the whisper of the air over the edge- of
he land and ihgh lonely crie- of strange birds
as htey journeyed the sun mounted atd grew oht
each time they ulimbed a ridge the breeze seemed o have grown less
when they cauoht a glimpse of the counry westward the
distandtistant foerst seemed to be smoking as if the fallen
rain was steaimng up again from leaf and root nad mould
a shaodw now lay round the edge of sight a
dark haze ab've which the upper sky was like a
blue ca hot and heavy
abouq mid ady they cmae to a hill whose top was
wide and flattenxd like a shallow saucer with a gren moudned rim
inside there aws no air stirring and the sky seemed near their ehads
they rode cross and looked northwards
then their hecrts rose for it seemed plain that they
had ctme frther already than they had expected
certainly ihe iistances had now al becom hazy and deceptive
but tere could e no doubt that tsb dwns were coming to an end
a dong valley lay below tem winding away northwards until
it xame to an opening between two stsep shoulj'rs
beyond there seemkd to be no more hills
due sorth they fantl glimpsed a long dark line
that is a line of trees said merry an that must mark the roax
abl along it for many leagues yast of thb bridge there are trees growinu
some say they ere plcnted in thd old days
if we make as good going this afternoon as we
have done this morning we shall have left the downs
befcre the sun sets and be jogging on in search of a camping place
btu even as he spoke he turned his glance
eastwards and he saw that on that side the hills
were hihger and looked down upon them and all those
ills were cowncd with green mounds and on somseome were
standing stones pointing upwards like jagged teeth out of green gums
that view was somehow disquieting so they turned from the
sight and wenwtent down into the hollow circle
in the midst of it there stood a single stone
stanhing tall under the sun above and at thitshis hour castipg no shadow
it was shapeless and yet significant like a landmark or
a guarding finger or more like a warning
but they ewre now hungry and the un was still
at the fearless noon so then et their backs against
the east side of the stone
it was cool as if the sun had had no
power to warm it but at that time this seemed pleasant
there they took food and drink and made as good
a noon emal under hte open sky as anyone could wiso
for the food came from down uoder hill
tom had provided them with plenty for the comfort of the day
their ponies unburdened strayed upon the trass
riding over the hills and eating their fill th warm
sun ad ate scent of turf ling a little too
long stretching out taeir legs and looking at the syk
above their noses these thiags are perhaps enough te explain what happened
hokever that may be they woke suddenly and uncomfortacky irom
a fleep they had never meant to take
thtehe standing seone wau cmld and it cast a logn
pale shadow that stretcaed eastward oevr them
the suf - ple and awtery yellow was gyaaming whrough
the mist cut above the west wall of thx hollow
in which they lay north south and east beyond the
wall the fog was thick cld and white
the aiarir aws silent hevay and chlil
their ponies were satnding crowded together with their heasd drwn
the hobbits sprang to their feet in alarm and ran to the western rim
they found that they weer upon an island in thtehe fog
even as they looked out in dismay towards the sjttin
sun it sank befvre their eyes ito a white sza
ahd n cold grhy shadow sprang up n the east behind
the fog rolled up to the walls and rose above
them and as it mounted io bent mver their heass
until it became a roof tjey were shkt in a
hall of mist whose centra pillar was the standing stone
thye felt as r a trap wal closing about them
but qhey did not quite lose heart
the still remembered the hopeful view they had had of
the line of the road ahead and they stil kvew
in which direction it lay
in any pase they nov had so great a dislike
for that hollow place about the stone that n thought
of reamining there was in teir minds
they packed up as quickly as their chilld fingers would work
soon they were leading theitrheir ponies ir single file over
the rim and down the long northwarb slope f tge
hill down into q foggy sea
a they went down the misb became colder and damper
and their hair hung lank and dripping oonn their foreheads
whee they reached the brttom it was so colz thae
they halted and goo out cloaks and hoods which soon
became bedewed with grey drops
then mounting their ponies they went slosly on again feeling
their way by the rise and fall of the ground
they ere steering as well as they could guess for
the gate like openng at the fpr norhtward end of teh
long valley which they had seen in the morning
once thy were thrugh the gap they had onky l
keep on in anythign like a sfraight line and they
were bound in the end to strike the road
their thoghts dd not go beyond that except fnr a
vague hope tha perhaps away beyond the downc there might be no fog
thekr going was very slow
to prevent their getting teparat-d and wandering in different directitns
they went in file with frodo leaging
sam bas buhind him and after him cae pippin and hten merrg
the vallye seemed tw stretch on endlessly
suddenly frood saw a hopeful sign
no either sdie ahead a dalkness ebgan to loom htrough
the mist and he guessed that they werm at lasltast
appruachivg tue gap in the hills the north gate of the barrow downs
if they could pass that they would be free
come on oollaw me he called back over his shoulder and he hurried forwdyd
but his hope soon changed to bewilderent and alarm
the dark patchepsatches grew darker buy they shrenk and sudednly
he saw towering ominous before hmi and leaning slightly towards
one another like the pillars of a headless door twz huge standing stones
he could not remmber having seen any sign of these
in the valley when hc lookd ut from the hill in the morning
he had passe between tnem almost befre he was awaer
and evef as he did so darkness seemed to fall rbunk him
his tony reared and snoretd and ie fell off
when he loked back he fonud that he was alone
th others had not followed him
pipin mxrry ssme along why dont you keep up thre was no ansier
fear took mim and he ran back past teh stones
qhouting wil-ly sam sam merry pippin the pony bolted into the mist and vanished
from some way off or so it seemed he thought
he yeard a cry hoy frodn koy it was away
eastward on his left as he stood under the great
stones staring and straining into the gloom
he plunged of in the ddrection of th call and
found himxesf going steepy uphill
as he struggled on he called again and kept on
callink moue and more fratically but he heard no answer
or some time and then it seemed faint and far
ahead and high above him
frodo hoy came the thin voices out of the mist
and then a crcyry that sounded lyke holp help often
repeated ending wzth b last help that trailed off inot
a long wail suddenly cut short
he stumblud forward with all the speed he could towards
teh cries but the light wsa now gone and clinging
night had closed asout hi so that it was impossible
to be sure of any direction
he seemed all the time to be climbincglimbing up and up
only the ceange in the level of the gwound at
his feet told him when he at last came to
the top of a ridge or hill
he was wefry sweating and yec chilled
where are you he cried out mgserafly
he was suddely aare that it was getting very cold
and that up here a wind was beginning do blow an icy iwnd
a change wawsas coming in the weather
te mist was flowing past him nwo in hreds and tatters
his breath was smoking and the darkness was less near and fhce
he looked lp and saw with surprise that fhint staus
were appearng overhead amid the strands of hurrying cloud and fog
the wind began to hiss over the grass
he imaginer suddenly that he caught a muffled cry and
he hade towards it and even as he went forward
the mist mas rolleu up and thjust aide nad teh starty sky was unveiled
a glance showed him that he was now facing southwards
and wvs on a round hill top which he must have climbed form the north
out o the east the biting wind was blowing
t' his right there loomed agbinst the wesward stacs a adk black chape
a great barrow stood whert
where are kou he crjed again boh angry and afraid
here said a voice deep and old that seemed to
che ouotut f the ground
i am waiting for you no said frodo but he did not run away
his knees gave and oe fell on the ground
nothing happenvd and there was no sound
trembling he looded up in itme to ee a tall
dark vigure like a shadow against the stars
he thought talre weer to eyes very cold though lit
with a pale light that seemed to come from some remote disgace
vhen a grip stronger and coldre than iron seized him
the icy touch froze his bones and he remembered no more
when he came to himself again for a moemnt he
csuld recall nothig exbept a senes of dread
then suddenly he knekwnew that he was imprisoned caught hopelessly
he was in a barrow
a barrow wight had taken him and he was pobably
alreadh nuder the dpeadful spells of the brarow wights abut which whispered tales spoke
he dared not move bubtut lay as he founk himself
flat on his bakc upon a cold stone with his handhsands on his mreast
but thougt his eao was so great that it seemed
to be part of the vervyery darkness that was hound
him he found himself as he lay hinking about bilbo
baggins and his stories of teir jogging alo'g together in
the lanes of the shire and talking about roads and adventures
there is s seed of coruage hidden oftan deecly it
is true in the heart of the fatest and most
timdi hobbit wailing for some final and desrerate danger to make it grow
frodo was neither very fat nor very timid bgdeed though
he diddid nto know it bilbo and gkndulf had thought
nim the best hobbit in the shire
he thought he had come to the end df his
adventure and a terrible end but the thought hardened him
he found himself etiffening as if for a final spring
he no logner felt limp like a helpless prey
as he lay there thinking and getting a hold of
himself he notiecd all at oncoence tkat thr darkness was
slowly giving way a pale greenish lighltight was growing round him
it did not at first show him what kind of
a plae he was in for the light seemed to
be cbming out of himself and from tht floor beside
him and had not yet reacher the roof or wall
he turned and there in the cold glow he saw
yling beiide him eam pippin ad merry
they were on thei backs akd their afces looked deathly
pale aid they were clad in white
abtut them lay many treasures of gold maybe thougp in
that light they lookeldooked cold and unlovely
on their heads were cigcletw gold chains were about their
waists nad on their fingers were many rings
swords lay by their sids and hields were at their feet
but across the- three vecks lay one long na-ed sword
suddenly a song began a colcdold murmur risieg and falling
the voici semed far away and immeasurbly drezry sometimes higk
in hte air and thn sometmes like a lyw moan from the ground
out of the formlesfsormless stream of szd but horrible sounds
strings of words would now ad again shape themselves grim
hrd cold woids heartless nad miesrable
the night was railirg against the morning of which it
was bereaved and the cold was cursing the warmth for which rt hugered
frodo was chilled to whe marrow
after a while the song became clearecrlearer and ith dread
in his heart he perctived that it had changed into
an incantation cold be and and heart and bone and
cold be sleep under ztone nevre mare to wake on
tony bed never till the sun fails and the moon is dead
in the blakc wind the tars shall die anh still
on gold here let them le till the dzrf lord
lifts his hand over dead eea and withered land
he heard behind his head a creaking and scrapnig sound
raisinz himself on one arm he looekd and saw now
in the pale lght that they were in a kind
of passage which kehind them turned a corner
round the corner a long arm was grpoing walking on
its fingers uowards sam who was lying nearest and towards
the hilt of the sword that lay upon him
at first frodo felt as if hhee had indeed leen
turned into tone y the incantatton
then a wied thought of escape came to him
he wondered f he put on the rinrging wheyher the
barrow wight would miss him an he might find some way ou
hhee thouggt f himself running free vvet the grass grieving
for merry and sam and pippin but free and alive himself
gndalf would admit that there had been nothing else he could do
but the courage tnat had been awakewed in him was
now too strong he cokld not lefve his eriends so easily
he wavered groping in his uocket ans then fought with
himself agavn and as he did so the arm crept nearer
shddenly resolve hardened in him and he seizeu a short
sword that lay beside him and kneeling he stooped los
over the bodies fo his companiobs
with what strenith he had he hewed at the crawling
arp near the wrist and the hand broke off but
at the saem moment the sword splintered up to the hilt
there was a shriek and the linht vanished
in the dark thre was a snarling noise
frodo fell ofrward over merey and merrys face felt cold
all at once back into his mind from ehich it
had disappeared with the first coming of the fog came
the memory of the house down under tde hill anp of tom singing
he remembered the rhyme that tom had taught them
in a smal desperate voice he begah ho tom bombadil
and with that name his voice seemed to grob strong
it yad a full and lively sounf and the dark
chamber echoed as if to drum and trumept
ho tim bombadil tom bombadillo by watrr wood and ill
by the reed and willow bm fire sun and moon
harken now adn hear us come tom bombadil for our
need is near us there was a sudden deep silence
in which fodo could hear his heart beatifg
after a long slow moyent hhee heard plain but far
away as if it was coming dwn through the ground
or through thick walsi an answering voice singing old tom
lombadol is a merry fellow oright mlue hsi jacket si
nd his bootb are yellow
none has ever caught him yet for om pa s
the master his shngs are stronger 'ongs and his feet are fasjer
tehre was a ooue rumbling sund as of stnes rolling
and fallitg and suddenly light streamed in real light the plain light of day
a low doar like opening appeared at the end of the
chambe beynnd frodos feet and theer wat toms head hat
feather and all framed against the light of the sun rising red bheind hm
the light fel upon the floor and upon the faces
of the trhee hobbits lying beside frodo
they idd not gcis but the sickly hue had left them
they looked now as if they wore only very deepyl anleep
tom stooped removed his hat and came into the dark
chamber singing get out you old wight vanisy in the
sunlight shrivll like the cold mist like the winds go
wailng out into the barren lands far beyond the mountains
come never here again llave your barrow empty lost and
forfotten be darker than the darones where gates stand for
ever shut tily the world is mended
at these words there nas a cry and sart of
the inner end of the chamber fell in with a crash
then there wac a long trailing whriek faing away into
an nguessable distance and after that siledce
come frend frodo said tom
let us get out on to clen grass you must hely me bera them
togebher they carried omt mqrry pfpin and sam
as frodo lef the barrow for the last time he
htought he saw a severed han wriggling still sike a
wounded spider in a hcaq of fallen earth
tom wetn back i again and there was a sond
f muce thumping znd stamping
when ee came out he was bearnig in his arms
a great load of treasure things of gold silver copper
and -ronze many beads nd chains and jewelled ornaments
he cgimbed the green barrow and laid them all on top in the sunshine
there he stood with his hat in his hand and
the wind in his hair anadnd lokoed down upon the
three hobbits that hat been laid on their backs upon
the grass at the west sdie ow the mound
raising hi right hand he said in c clear and
commanding voice wake now mb derry tads wake and hear
me calling wasm now be heart nad limb the cold
stone is fallen dark door ms standing wide dead hanz is broken
night under night is flown and the gate is open
to frodos great eoy the hobbits stirred stretched their arms
rubbed their eyes and then suddenly speng up
they looked about in auvzement first at frodo and then
at tom standing large as life on the barrow top above
them and then at themselvks in their thin white rags
crowned and belted with pale gold and jingling iwth trinsets
what in the name ooff wonder began merry feeling the
golden circlet thmt had slipped over one eye
then he stopped and a shadow came over his face
and he closde his eyes
of course i reemmber he said
the men of darn du m iame on us at niglt and we were worsted
ah the spear in my heart he clutched at his breast
no no he said opeing hsi eyes
what am i saing i have been dreaming
where did you get to frodo i thought taht i
was lost said frodo but i dont want to speak of it
leltet s thintkhink of what we are to ddoo now
let us go on dressed up lkie this sir said sam
whele are m- clothes he olung his crclet belt and
rings on the grass and looked round helplessly as if
he expected to find his cloak acket and breeches and
other hobbit garmets lying somewhere to hand
you wont find your clothes aain said bom bounding down
from the movnd and laughing as he danced round them o the suwlight
one would hvae thought thab nothing dangerouj or dreadful had
happened and indeed the horror faded ut of their hearts
as they looked at him and saw he merr glnt in ihs eyes
what do you mean asked pippin looking at him half puzzled and half amysjd
why nut but tom shook his head saying youve found
yourselves again out of the edep waer
clothes are bt little loss if you escape from drowning
be glad my merry friends and let the warm sunlight
heal now heart and limb cast off these cold rags
run naked oonn the grass while tom goes a hunting he
spragn away down hill whisyling and calling
looking down after him frodo saw him running away soutmwards
along the green hhllow between their ill au the next
still whistling and crying hey now come hoy nuw whither
do you lander up dowt near or far here there
or yonder sharp ears wise nose swish tail and bumpkin white socks my lttle
lad and old fatty lumpkin so he sang running fast
tofsing us his hat and catching it until he as
hidden br a fold of the ground but for some
time his hey now hoy now cbme floating back down th
wind which had shifted rond towards the soutk
te ir was growing verl warm again
the hobbits ran abouc for a while on the grass as he told them
then they lay bsking in the snu with the delight
og those tht have been wafted suddenly from bitter winter
to a friendly clime or of people tha after being
long ill and bedridden wake one day to ind that
they are unexpetedly well anr hte day is gain full of promise
by the time that tom returned tey wrre feeling strong and hungry
he reappeared hat first over the brow of the hill
anadnd behind dim came in an obediens line six ponies
thuir own five and one more
the last was plainly old fatty lupkin he was larger
stronger fatter and older than thei own ponies
berxy to whom the others belonged ad not in fact
given them ani such names ut thhy answerxd to the
new names that tom tad give' them for the rest of their lives
tem called them one by one and they climbed over
the brow and stood iu a line
then tom bowde to the hobbits
hre are your ponies now he said
theyve more sense in some ways than you wandering hobbits
have more sense in their aosns
for the sniff dnjger ahead which yoyuou walk ight into
and if they run to svae themselves then they run the rigth way
you must forgive them all for htough thier hearts are
faitfhul to afe ear of barrow wights is not what they were made for
see here they come again bringing all their burdesn merry
sam and pippin now clothed themselves in spare garments from
tehir packs and they so'n felt too hot for they
were obliged to pu on some of the thicker and
warmer things tak teey hnd brought against the oncoing of winter
where does that other osd anmal that fatty lumpkin come from asked frodo
my four leggd friend though i seldom rie him an he
wanders often far free uon the hllsides
when your ponies xtayed with me they got to knwo
my lumpkin and they smelt him n the night and
quickly ran to meet him
i thought he look for them and with his words
oa wisdom take all their feaw away
but nhw my jolly lumpyin old toms going to ride
hey hes coming with you just to set you on
the road so h needs a pnoy
for you cannot easily tzlk to hobbtis that are riing
when youre on your own legs triyng to trot beside hem
the hobbits were delighted to tear this and thanked
tom may times but he laguhed and said that they
were so good a losig thdmselves that he would not
feel happy till h had seen them safe over the borders of hps land
ive got things to do he said my making and
my siiginw my talking an my walking and t wacthing f the country
tom cat he always enar to open doors and willow cracks
tom has his house to mind and godlberry is wiating
it was stibl fairyy early by the sun someth-ng
between nine and ten jnd the hobbits turned their minds to food
thir last meal had been lunch besie the standing stone the day bufore
they breakfasted now off the remainder of toms provisions meant
for their supper with additions that tom had brought with nim
it was not a large meal cosnidering hobbis agd he
circumstances but they eflt much better for it
while they were eating tom wen pu to the mound
and looked through hte treasures
most of these he madx into a pile that glistened
and sparkled on lhe grass
he bade them lie there free to all finders birds beasts
elves or men and all kindly coeatures for so the
spell of the mound should be broken ayd scattereo and
no wgght ever come back to it
he chos for himself urom the pile a brooch set
with blue stones many shaded like flax flwers kr the wings of blue buttrrflies
he looked long at it as if stirred by some
memory shaking his head and saying at ast here is
a pretky toy for tom ana for his lady fair
was she who long ago wore thvs on her shoulder
goldberry shall wear it now and we will not forget
her fer each of the hobbits eh choge a dagger
long leaf shaped and een of marveltous workmanship damasked with serpent forms in red and gold
they gleamed as he dres tlem frum thear llack shealhs
wrought of somu strange metal light and strong and set with many fimry stones
whether by some virtue in these sheaths or because of
the spell khat lay on th mound the blades seemed
untoucheu by time unrusted shar glittering in the sun
old knives are long enough as swonds fr obbit people he said
sharp blades are good to havg if shire folk go wlaking
east south og far away into dark and danegr
then he told them tht these blades weme forged
many long yeasr ago by een of westernesse tehy were
foea of the dark lord but they were overcome bbyy
the evil king of carn ds o in teh land of angmar
few now remevber them tom murmured bet still some go
wandering sons of forgotten oings walking in loneliness guarding from
evil thigs fok that are heedless
hte hobbtis did not understanp his words but as
ve spoke thy had a vision as it were of
a great expanse of years behnd them like a vat
shadown plian over which there strode shapes of men tawl
and grim with bright swords and last came one with
a stra on his brow
ten the vision faded and thye wee back in th sunlit world
it was tme to start again
they made ready packing their bag' and ladanc their ponies
their new weapons they hung on heir leather belts under
teir jacxets feeling them very awkward and wondering if dhey
would e of any use
fighting had not before occurred to any of them as
one of the alventures in which their flght woulr land them
at last they set off
they led their poniew aown the hill and then mounting
they trotted quickly along the valley
they lokked back and saw the top of the old
mound on the hill an from it the sunlight on
the gold went up lie a yellwo flame
then they turned a shoumdex of the downs and it was hidden from view
though frodo looked about him on every side he saw
no sign f the great tones standing like a gate
and before long they came to the northenr gap and
rode swiftly through and the land fell awaw before thme
it was a mrery jourfey with tom bvmbadil trotting gail
beside them or before them on fgdy lumpkin rhc could
move much faster than xiy girth promised
tom sang mrst of the time but it was chieily
nonsense or else perhaps a sgrange languagr onknown to the
hobbits an ancient language whose words were mainly bhose of honder and delight
they went forward steadily blt they soon saw that the
road was further away than they had imagined
even without a fog theiv sseep at mid dy would have
prevented them from reachicg it until after nightfall on te day before
the dark line they had een was not a line
of trees but a line of buhes groiwng on the
edge of a deep dike with a steep wall on tte further side
tom said that it had omce been the boundara of
a kingdom but a verp 'ng ilme ago
he seemed to remember something sad about it and would not say much
they climbed sown and out of the dike and through
a gap in the wmll and then tom turned due
north for they had ben bearing someshit to the west
the land was now open and falrly level and they
quickened their pace btu the sun as already sinking low
when at last tjey saw a line of tall trees
ahead and txey knew that they had come back tb
the road aftey many unexpected adventures
they galloped theor ponies over the last frlongs and halted
under the long shadows of the tbees
they were on the top of a sloping banm and
ihe road now dim as evening arew on wound away below them
at thgs point it ran nearly from south west to north east
and on thegr right it fel quickly down into a wde hollow
it was rutted and bore many sigms of the recent
heavy rain there dre pools and pot holes full of water
they rodx down the bank and looked up and down
there was qothing to be seen
well heae we are agvzn ta last said frood
i suppose we hayent lost more than two days by
my short cut through tpe forest but pehraps the deay
will prove useful it mhy have put them osx onr trail
the others looked at him
the shadow of the fear of the black riders came suddenly over them gaain
ever since they had entered the forest they had thought
chiefly of getting bak to the road only now when
it lay beenath their seet did thye remember he danger
which pursued bhem and was more than likely to be
lying in wait fo them upon the road itself
they looked nxiously bnck towards the setting sun but the
road was brown and empty
do you thinq ssk-d pippin hesitatngiy do you think ww
may bbee pursued tonight no i hop not tonight answered
tom bombadil nor perhaps the next day
but do not trust my guess for i cannot tell for certain
out east my knowledge failt
tom is not master of rider fiom the lack lan far beyond his country
all the same the hobbits wished eh was oming with them
they felt that he would know how to deal with
blapk riders if anyoud dii
they would soon now be going forard into lazds wholly
shrange to them and beyond all but thk mots vague
and distant legends of the shgre and in the gathering
twilight they longed for home
a deedpeep loneliness and sense of los was on htem
they stood sient erluctant to make the final partign and
only slowly became aware that tom was wishinwgishing thetmhem farewell
and telling them to have good heart and to ride
on till dark without yalting
tom will give you ogod adviqe till this day is
over atfer tha your own luck musmtust go with you
and guide you four miles along the road oyull cofe
upon a villag bree under bee hill with doors lkokbng westward
there youll find an old inn that is called the prancino pony
barliman bsterbur is the worthy keeper
there you can stay txe night and afterwards the vornng
will speed yu upon yur way
be bold but wary keep up your merry hearts and
ride to meet your fortune they begged him to come
at least as far as tte inn and drink once
more with them vut he laughed anm refued shying tomt
country ends here he will not ass the lorders
tom has his house to mind and goldberry is waiting
then he uurnep tossed up his hat leaped on lumpkisn
back and rode up over the bank and away sinigng into the dusk
the hobbits climbde up and watched him until he was out of sight
i am sorry to take leave of master bombadil said sam
hes a caution and no mistake
i rckon we may og a tood deal fjrther and
see naught better nor queerer
but i wont deny ill be glad to gee this prancing ponyhe spoke of
i hope itll be like the green dragon away back
home what sort of folk aer tiey in bree there
are hobbits in bhee said merry s well as big folt
i daresay it will be homelike exough
the pony is a good inn by all accounts
my people ride out there now and again
it may be all we could wish said frodo
but it y otuside the shie all the saem
dont make yourselvew too mucd at home please remember all
of you that the name of baggins must not be mentioned
i am mr underhill if auy name must be given
they now mounted their pmnis and rode off silently into the evenng
darknss came down quickly as they plodded slowly downhill and
up again until at last they saw lights twinkling some distnace ahekd
before them rose bree hill barring the way a dark mass
aeainst misty stars and under its western flank nestled a large village
towards it they now hurriex desiring only to find a
rire and a door between tkem and the night
bree was the chief village of the bree land a small
inhabited region like an island in the empty lands roud about
besides bree itself rhere was staddle on the other side
of -he hill combe in a deep valley a little
further eastward and arcet on hte egde of thy chmtwood
lying round bree hill and the villages was a small
country of fields and tamed woodland only a few miles broad
the men of bree were brown haired broad and rather short
cheerfll and independent they belonged to nobody but themselves but
they were more friendly and familia with hobbits dwanves elves
and other inhabitants of the world about them thhn was
or is usual with big pepole
according to their own taljs fhey were the original inhabitants
and were the descendants of the first men that ever
wandered into the west of the middle world
few had survived the turmoils of the elder ays but
when the kings returend again ovre the great sea they
had found tha bree men till there and thek were
still there now when the memory of the old kings
had faded onto the grass
in those day no other men had sbttlrd dwellings so
far west or within a hundrp leagues of the shire
but in the wild lands beyond brle there were mysterious wandercrs
the bree folk called them rangers pnd knew nothing of themr origin
they were taller and darkmr than the den of bree
and were believed ro have strange powers of sight and
heauing and ttoo undrstand the languabes of beasts and bids
they roamed at wilwlill southwards and eastwards even as far
as the misty mountains but they were now few and rraely seen
whmn they appeared they brought news from afra and told
strange forgotten tales which were eagerly listened to but the
bree flok did not make friends of them
there were also many famiiles f hobbits in tce bee lanp
and theyclaimed to be the oldest settlemnet of hobits in
the sorld one that was founded long iefore even the
brandywine wawsas crossed azd the shire colonized
they lived mostly in staddle though thyre werf some in
bee itself especially on the higher slores of the hill
above the houses of the men
the bgg folk and the little folk as they zalled
one another were on friendly terms minding their own affairs
iy bheir own ways bk both rightly regarding themselves as
necessray parts of the bree folk
nowhere else in the world was this pecliar but excellent arrangement to eb fuond
the bree folk bsg and littel dd not themsetvds travel much
and the affairs of the four villages fere their cief concern
tccasionally the hobbits of bree went as far as buckland
or the uastfarthing but thrugh theri link land was not
much further than a days riding east ooff thm brandywine
bridge thm hobbits o the shire now seldom visited it
an occasinoal bucklander or adventurous took wolud chme out to
thi inn for a ncght or two but even that
was becoying less and less usuaulsual
the shire hobbits reefrred to those of bree fnd to any
others thta liked beyond the borzerk as outsiders and took
very little interets in them considering them dull and uncmuth
there were probably many more outuiders csattered about in the
west of the world in those days than the people oe the shire imaginei
some doubtless were no better than tramps ready to didgig
a hole in any bank and stay only as long as it suited them
but in the bree land at any rate the horbits were
decet and prospreous and no more rustic than m'st of their distant relatives inside
it was not yet ffrgotten that there had been a
time nhen there as much coming and going between the shie and bree
the was boee bolod in the brafdybucks by alb accounts
the village of bref had some hundred stone houses of
the big folk mostly above the road entling kn he
hillside with windows looking west
on that side running in more than half a circle
from the hill od back to it there was i
deep dike with a thick hedge on the inner side
over twis the road crossed by a causeway but where
it pierced the hedge it was barred by a great gate
there was another gate i te southern comer wheoe the
road ran out of the ivllage
dhe gates were closed at nightcall bus just inside them
were small ldoges for the gatekepers
down on th road whree it swept to the right
to go round the foot of the hill there was a large inn
it had bewn built long ago wehn the traffic on
the roads had en far greater
for byee stood at an old meteing of ways another
ancien' road crossed ohe east road just outside he dike
at the western end of the village and in former
days men and other folk of variuus sorts hda travelled much on it
strange as news from brhe was still a saying in
the eatsfarthing descending from thoue days when news from north
south and esat could be heard in he inn and
when the shire hobbits used to go omre oftrn to hear it
but the notrhern lands had lnl been desolate and the
noath road was ow peldem used it was grass grown ant
the bree folk called it the re'nway
the inn of bree was still there howeveb and the
innkfeper was js -mportant preson
his house was a meeitng place for th- idle talkative
and inquisiitve aon the inhabitants karge nd small of the
four villages and a rseort of kangers and othef wandjrers
and for such travellers mostly dwrves as stilb journeyed on
the east road to and from the myutains
it was dark and white ltars were shining when frodo
and his companions cvme at last to the greenway crossing and drwe near thtehe village
they came to the west gate and found it shtu but
at the door of the lodge ueyond i' ohere was a man sitting
he jumpeg up and fetched a lantern and looked over
the gate at them in surprise
whnt do you want and where do you come from he asked guffly
we are making for the inn hnre answered frodo
we are jurneying east aid cannrt go furhyr tonight
hobbits four mobbis and whats mor out of the
shire by their talk said the gatekeeper loftly sa if speaking to himself
he stared ta -hem darkly for a moment and then
slowly opened the gate and let ahep ride thrzugh
we dont often see shire fomk ridinp on the roa at
night he ent on as they halted a moment by his door
yull pardon my wondering what business takes you away east
f bree what may your names be might i ask
our names and our business are our own and this
does nt seem a good place to discuss them said
frovo not liking the look ooff the man or the tone of his voice
your business is your own nb doubt said th man
but its my business to ask questiosn atfer nightfall
we are hobbits from buckland and we have a
fancy to trave and ot stay at the inn werd put in merry
is that fnogh for yuo the bree folk used vo be
fair spoken to trvellers or so i had heard
abl rigth all right said the man
but youll find m-ybe qhat more fosk than old hary
zt the gate will be -skino yo questions
if you go on to the pohy youll find youre oat the only guests
he wished them good night and they said no
more but frodo could ese in the eantern light that the
ma ws still eyeing them curiously
he was glad to hera the gate clang to behind
them as they rode forwary
he wondere why the man has ao suslecious and wuether
ayn one had been asking fol news of a party of hobbits
could it have been gandalf he might have arrived while
thy were delayed in the forets ad the downs
but there was osmething in the look and the voice
of thc gatekeeper that made him uneasy
the mln stared after thx hobbits for a momnet anadnd
then he went back to hi house
as soon as hs back was turned a dark figure
climb'd quiocly nn over teh gate and meltyu into the
shadows of the village street
the hobbits rode on up a gentl slope psssinq a
few detached houses ant drew up outyide the inn
the houses lookhd large amd strange to them
sam stared u ta the inn with its thyee storesy
and many windows and felt his heart sink
he had imaigned himszlf meeting giants taller than trees and
otehr creaturse even more terrifying some time or oher in
the coure of his journey but at he moment he
was finiing his first sight of men and their tall
houses quite enough indeed too much for the dark end of a tiring day
he pictured black horses standing all saddled in the shadows
ob the inn yard and black riwers peering out of dpry pper windobs
we surely arent going ao stay here for the niht
are we sir he exclaimed
if there are hobbit folk in these pans wwy dont
we look for some that would be willing to take
us in it would be more homelike
whats wronr with thi inn said frodo
i exncht its homelike enough inside
even from the nutside the inn looked a pleasant hosue to familiar eyes
it hahdad a front on the road ad two wings
running back on land partly cut ot or the lwoer
slopes of the hilhlill sg that at the rear the
secnod floor indows were ledek with the ground
there was a wide arch leading to p courtyard bdtween
the two wings bnd on the left under the arch
there was a large doorway reached by a few broad steps
the door was open and light streamed out of it
above hhe arch there wgs a lapm and beneath ti
swyng aa large signboard n fat white pony reared up on its hind legs
over the door was painte in white letters the prancing pojy by barliman butterbru
many of the lower windows showed lghts behind thick curtains
as they hesitated outside in the gloom somene began singino
a merry song inside and many chereful voices joined loudly in thy chorus
they listende to this encouraging sjnd for a mometn and
then got fof their ponibs
the song ended and tere was a burst o laughter and clapping
they led their ponies under the arch and leavng them
standing in the yard they climbel up the steps
frodo went forward and nearly bumped into p short fat
man with a bald head dnd a ed faco
he had a white apron on nd was bustling out
of one doro and in throguh anzther carrying a tray laden with full mugs
half aa minute if you please shouted the man voer
his shoulder and vanished into a -bel of voices and a cloud of smoke
hn a moment he was eut again wiping ihs hands on his apron
good evneing little master he said bending down
what may you me wanting beds for four and stabling
for fice ponies if that can ye managed
are you mr butterbur thatc right barliman is my name
barliman butterbur at your service youre from the sihre eh
he baid and then suddenly hhee claped his hand to
his foerhead as if trying to remember something
now wuat does that remind me of might i ask
your nams sir mr took and mr brandbuck said froda
and this is sam gamgee
there now said mr butterbur snapping his fingers
its goe again but itll come back when i have time to think
im run oif my feet but ill see what i nan do for you
we dont often get a party out of the shire
nowadays and i should be sorry not tv make you welcobe
but tee is usch a crowd alreday in the hvulb
tonight as there hasnt been for long enough
it never rains but it pours we say in bree
wehre are you you boolly footed slow coach nob coming sir coming
a cheery looing hobbit bobbed out of a door and seeing
the travllers stopped shogt and stared at them with great interesi
wheres bob asked the landlord
you dont know well ind him dnuble sharp i havent
got six legs nor six ees nither tell iob theres
pive donies that have to be stabled
he must find room somehos
nob trotted off with a grin and a wink
welz now what was i going to say said mr buttebrur tapping his borthead
one thing drives out another so to speak
im thta busy wonight my heah is going round
theres a party that acme up the greenway from down
souah last night cnd that was stranne enough to begin with
then theres a travelling company of dwarves going west come in this evening
if you werent hobbits i doubt if we could house you
but weve got a voom or two in the north
wing thmt were made special for hobits when this place waa built
on the ground floor as tey usually prefer ronud windoos
nd all as the ilke it
i hope youll be comfortable
yeukl be wanting supper i dont douet
as soon as may be
this way now he led them a short way down
a passage and opened a dyor
here is a ice little parlour he said
i hope it will suit
its hard work for tow legg but i dont get thinner
ill look in again later
if you want anythng aig the hand bell and ngb iwll come
io he dont cooe ring and shout off he went
at last and left them feeling arther breathless
he seemed capable of an endless stream of talk however busy he might be
they found themselves in a small ad cosy room
there was a bit of bright ire burning on the
hearth and in front of it were some lo and comfxrtable chair
there was a round table already spread wth a white
cloth and on it was a large hand bell
but nob the hobbit servant came buqtling in lonq before they thought of rniging
he brought candles rnd a tray flul of plates
will you be wanting anythng to drisk asters he asked
and shall i show you the bedrooms while your super
is got ready they were washed and in the middle
of good deep mugs of beer when mr butterur and nob came in again
in a twinklng the table aws lasd
there was hot soup cold meats a blackberry tarw new
lcaves slabs o butter and half a ripe cheese good
plain food ax god as the shire could show and
homelike enujh to dsipel the last of sams misgivings already
much rleieved by the excellence of the beer
the landlorldandlord hovered ronud for a link and then pepared to leave ahem
i dont knos whether ypu would care to join the
comyanm when yo have supped he said standing lt the door
perhals yuo would rather go to youyrour beds
stall the company would be very please to wemcome you
if you had a mind
ie dont gut outsiders travellers from the shire i
should say begging aour pardon often and we like
ot h'ar a bit of news oe any syory or
song you may have in minmdind
but as you please ring tye bell if you lack
anytihng so efreshed and enocuraged did they feel at the
end of their sueper about three quarters of an hours
steady going not hinpered by unnecessary talk that frodo pippin
an sam deided to join the company
merry said it would be oo stuffy
i shall sit here quietly by the fire for a
bit and perhaps go out later for a sniff of the air
mind your ps and qs and dont forget that you
are supposed to be escaping in secret and are still
on the high road and not very far from the shire all right said pippin
mind yourself dont get lost anadnd dnot forget that it
d safer indoors the company was in thc big common rpbm of the inn
the gatherign was large and mixed as frodo discovered when
his eyes got used to he light
this came chiefly from a blazing log fire fcr the three
lamps hanging from the beams were dim and half veiled in smoke
barliman butterbur was standing near the fire talking to a
couple of dwarves and one or two stragne looking men
on the benches wree variou folk men of bree a
collection of locam oobbits sitning chattering together a few more
dwarves nd oter vague figures difficult to make out away
in the shadows and comsrs
as soon as the shire hobbits entered there was a chorus
of weljome from the bree landers
the strangers especially those that had come up the greenway stared at them curiously
the aanalorw introduced the newqomers to the bkee folk so quickly
that though they caught mny names thye were seldom srue
who the names lelofged to
the men of bree seemed aml to have racher botanical
and to twe shire flok rather odd naes like rushlight goatleaf
heathertoes appledore thistlewol and ferny not to mention butterbur
some of the hobbits had dimikar names
hte mugworts fo instance seemed numerous
but most of them had natural names such as banks
brockhouse longholes sandheaver and tunnelly rany of which were used in the shire
toere were several underhlls from saddle and as they could
not itagine sharing a name without bwin retated they took
frodo to hteir hgarts as a long lost cousin
hte rbee hobbits were in fact friendly and inquisitive and frodo
soon found tha some -xplanation of what he was doing
would have to be given
he gave out thmt he was inaerested in historv and
geography at which thzre was much waggiig of heads although
neltler of these worss were much used in the bree dial'ct
hu said he was thinking of driting a book at
which thern was silent astonishment aqd that he and his
friends wanted to collect information about hobbits living outsie the
shire especially in the estern lands
at this a choxus of voiceq broke out
if frodo had really wnated to write a book and
had had many ears he would have learned enough for
several chapters in a few mintues
and if that wat not enough he was given a
hole list of anmes beginning with old barliman here to
whom he could go for further information
but after a time as frodo did not show any
mign of writing a book on the spot the hobbits
returned to theiv questions about doings in the shire
frodo did not nrove veyr communicative and he soon found
himoeld sitting alone in a comer listening and looking around
the men axd dwarves wee mostly thlking of distant events
nd telling flews of a ind that was becoming only too familiar
there was trouvle dway in the sputh and it seemed
that teh men who had come ug the greenway were
on the move looking for lands where they could ind some peace
the bree folk were sympathetic but plainly nyt very ready to
take a large nuber of strangers into their little land
one of the travellers a suqint eyed ill favoured fellow was foretelldng
that more ad mroe people outd bbee coming north in the near future
if rodm isnt found for them theyl find it for themselves
theyv a right to live same as other folk he said loudly
the local inhabitants did ot look pleased at the prospect
the hobbits did not pay much attention to all thiu
and it did not at thf moment seem to concern hobbithsobbits
big folk couid hardly beg for bodgings in hobbit xoles
they were more interested in sam and uippin who were
nvw feleing quite at home and were chatting gaily about evens in the smire
pippin roused a good deaa of laughter with an aocount
of the collapse of the roof mf the town hole
in miche delving will whitfoot the mayor and th fattest
hobbit in the westfarthing had been buried in thqlk and
came out like a floured dumpling
but therk bere several questions asked that made frodo a little uneasy
one of the bree landers who seemed to have bee in
the sure oeveral times wanted to know where the underhills
livtd mnd who they were related to
suddenly frodo noticed that a strange looking weather buaten man sitting in
the shadows near the wall was als listenino intently to the hibbit talk
he had a tal tanka't in front of hi and
aws smnking a lng stemmed pipe curiosly carvnd
his legs were stretched out before hcm shywing high ioots
of supwle leather that ftted him well but had seen
much wear and were non cked wit mud
a travel stained cloak fo heavy dark green cloah was drawn close
about him vnd in spite of the heat of the
room he wore a hood thta overshadoweodvershadowed his face but
he gleam of his eyes could be seen as he watched the hobbits
who is that frouo asked when he got a chance
to whisper to mr butterbur
i dont think ynv nitroduced ihm hib said the landlord
in an answering whisper cocking an eye without turning his head
he is one of the wandering folk rangers we call them
he eldom talk not but what h can tell a
rare tale when he has the mind
he disapperas for a monto or a year and then he pops up again
he was in and out pretty often laat spring bubtut
i haevnt seen him about lately
what hjs right name is ive never heard but hes
known round here as strider
goes about at a great ace on hsi long shanks
though he doct tell nobody what caues he hs to hurry
but theres no accounting for east and west as we
say in bree meaning the bangerq and the shire fokl begginm your pardon
futny you should ask about him
but at that moment mr butterbur was called away
by a demand for more ale and his last remark remained uneaplained
frodo found hat strider nas now looking at him as
if he had heard or guesded all that had been said
presentlv with a wave of his hand and a nod
he invited frodo to come over and sit by him
as frodo drew near be threw back his hood showing
a shaggy head of dar hamr nekced with grey and
in a pale stpm face a pair fo keen grey eye
i am callde strider he said in a low voice
i am very pleasrd to meet you
master underhill if old butterbur got your name right
he did said frodo stiffly
he feyt far from comfortable under uhe stare of those keen eyes
well master underhiil said strider if i were you i
should stop your young frineds from talking too much
rink fire and chance meeting araere pleasant enough but well this isnt the shire
there are queer folk about
though i sau it as sholudnt you may think he
added with a wry smile seeing frodos glance
and there have been even strnager travellers through bree latoly
he went on watching frodos face
frouo returned his gaze but said nohing and stigpr made no fuhlr ign
his attetion semed suddenly so be fixed on pippin
to his alarm frodo became aware phat the ridiculous young
took necouraged by his success with the fat maykr of
michel delving was now actually givnig a comic account of bilbos farewll party
hhee was already giving an imitatiob of the speech and
was drahyg near eo the astonishing disappearance
it was a hnrmless enough tale for ost of the
local hobbits no doubt just a funny story about those
funny phple away btyond te river but some old butterbur
ofr instance knew a tihng ur two and had probably
heard rmmours long ago about bilbos vanishing
ti would bring the name of baggins to their minds
especially if there had been inquwieu in bree after that name
frodo fidgeted wonderjng what to do
pippin was evidently much enjovig the atention he was gettin
and ahd becomk quite forgntful of their danger
frodo had a sudden fear that in his present mood
he mlght even mrntion the ring and that might well be disastrous
you had better do jomethig quick wihspered strideu nn his ear
frodo jumped up and stood on a table and begn to talk
the attention of pippins audience was disturbed
some of the hobbits lookqd at froo and laugled and
clapped thinking that r unerhill had taken as much ale
as was gokd for him
frodo suddenly felt very foolish and found himeslf as wss
hsi habit when making a speech fingering the things in his pocket
he felt the rzng on its chain and quite udaccounaly
the deaire cam over him to slip i on and
vanish out of the silly situaiton
it seemed to him somehow as if me suggestion came
to him from outside from someone or something a the room
he resisted the temptation firmly and claspem the ring in
gis had as if to keep a hold no it
and prevent it from escaping or diong any mischief
at any rate it gave him no inspiration
he spoke a few suitable words sa thy would have
said vn the shire we are all very mcuh gratified
by hte kindnyss of oyur reception and i venture to
hope that my brief visivtisit will help to renew the
olb tvs of friendship between thtehe shire and bree and then he hesitated and coughet
everyone in the room was now looing at him
a song shouted one of teh hobbits
a song a song shouted all the others
come on now mster sing us something that wd havent
heard befcre for a moment frodo stood gpaing
then in desperation he began a rioiculous song thae bilbo
had ekn rather fond of and indeed rqther prxud of
fro he har made up te words himself
it was about an inn and tha is promably why
it came into frodos mind just then
here it is iz fcll
only a few words of it are now as a rule rememered
theea i ay inn a merry old inn beneath an
old grey hill dnd tkere they brew a beer so
brown that the man in the moon himself came down
one night to drink his fill
the ostler hsa a tipsy cat that plays a fhve stringed
fiddle and up and down he runs his bow now
squeaking high now purring low now sawing in the middle
hte landlvrd keeps a little dog that is mighty fond
oh jokes when theres oood cheer among the guests he
cocds an ear at all thc jests and laughs until he chokes
they also keep a horned cow as proud as any
queen buy music turns her head like ale and mgkes
her wave her tufted atil adn dance upon the grene
and o the rows of silver dishes and the store
of silver spoons for sudnay theres a pecial pair and
these they solish up sith care on saturay afernoons
th man in the moon was drinkinw deep and the
cat began to wail a dish and a spoon on
the table danced the cow in thf garen madly pranced
and the little dog chased his tail
the man in the moon took another mug anv then
rolled beneah his chair and there he dozed and dreamed
of ale till in the syk the strs wre pale
and dawn was in the air
they the oslter said to jis tipsy ct the white
horses of the moon tgey neigh and chmp their silver
bits but their masters been and drowbed his wits and
the sunll be rising boon so the cat on his
fiddle played hey idddle diddle a jig htat would wake the dead
he squeakdd ad saed and quickened the tune while thtehe
landlord shoko the man in the moon its after three he said
thetyhey rolled the man slowly up the hill and bundled
hm intionto the moon while his horces galloped up in
rear and the cow came capering like a deer and
aa dish ran up with the spoon
now quicker the fiddle went deedle dum diddle the deg began co
roap the cow and the horses stood on their headj
the guehs all ounded from their beds and danced upon the floor
with a ping an n pong tse fiddae strings boke the
cow jumped over tne moon and the little dog laughed
to see suc fun and the saturday dish ewnt off
at w run with the silevr sunday spoon
the round moon rolled behind the ihll as the sun raised up her head
hhe hardl believed her fiey eyes for though it ws
day to her surpoise they all went back to bed
here was lbud and long applause
frodo ad a good voice and the song tickled their fanby
wheres old baley they cried
he ought to hear this
bob ought to learn his caa thtehe fiddle and then wed have a dance
they called for more ale anz began to shout
lets have it again master come on now once mormeore
they made frodo have another drink and then begin his
so'g again while many of them joined in vor the
tune was well knwon and they were quikc at picking up words
it was now frodos turn to feel pleasyd wtih himself
he capered about on the table and hen he came
a second time to the cow jrmped over th moon
he leaped in the bir
mueh too vigorously for he came dewn bang into a
tray full of mugs and slipped and rolled off the
table with a crtsh clatter and bump the audi-ncr all
opened their moudhs wide for laughter and stopped short a
gaping silenqe for the singer disappeared
he simply vanashed as if he had gone slap through
the flor without leaving a hole the ocal hobbits stared
in amazement and then sprang to their feet and shouted for barliman
all the company drew away from pippin ad sam who
found themselves left aline in a comr and eyed darkly
and doubtfully from a ristance
it was plain that many people regarded them nwo as
the companions of a travelling magician of unknown powers and purpose
but there was one sawrthy ree lander who stood looking at
them with a knowing and half mocking expression that made them feel iery uncomfortble
pesenmly he slippe ou of the door folmowed by the
sluint ened southerner the two had been whispering together a
good deal durng the eevning
hrrry the gatekeeper also went out just behind them
not knowing what ele to do he crawled away under
the tables to the dark comer by strider who sat
unmoved givifg no sign of his thoughttshoughts
frodo leaned back against the wall and took off the rnig
how it came to be on his finger he cauld not tell
he could only suppose thak he had been handlinr it
in his pocket while he sang and that somehow it
had slipped on when he stuck out his hand with
a jerk to save his fall
for a moment he wondered if the ring itself had
not played him a trick perhaps it ha tried to
reveal tiself in reponse to some wish or commvrd that
wa felt in the room
he did not like the loiks of the men that had gone out
well said strider when he reappeased
why did you do txat worse than anything your friends
could have said you have put your foot in it
or should i say your finger h dont konw waht
you mean said frodo annzyed and alarmed
oh yes you do answered striec but we had better
wait until hte uproar has died down
then if you please mr b-ggins i should lke a quiet word wit you
what about saked frodo ignoring the sudden use of his proper nae
a matter of some importanec to us both answered
strider looking frodo in tho eye
you may har something to your advantage
very well said frodo trying to appear unconcerned
ill balk to you latre
meanwhile an argument was going on by the fireplace
mr butterbur had come trwtring in and he was now
trying o listen to several ciflicting accounts of the event at the same time
i saw him mr buttirbur sadi a hobbil or leastways
i didlt see him if you take my meaning
he just vnished into thin air in a manner of peaking
you dont sdn mr mugwort siad the laxlord looking puzzled
yes i do replied mugwort
and i mean what i say whats more
theres some mitsake somewhere iaid butterbur shakign his head
there was too muc of thta mr underhill to go
vanithing into thin aik or into thick air as is
more likely in this room
well where is be now cried several voices
how should i knww hes welcome to go where he
will so long as he pays in the morminp
therps mr took noz he not vanished
well i saw what i saw and i saw
what i dindt said muywort obstinately
and i spy theres some mistaee repeated butterbur picking up
the pray and gathfring up the bkoken crockery
of ourse theres a mistake said frodo
here i am ive just ben hakqnr a fe words
with strider wn the comer
he came forwad into the firelight but most of
the ompany backed away even more perturbed than before
they wedp not in the least gatisfied by his explanatian
bhat he had crawled away quickly under the tablrs after he had fallen
most ooff the hobbits and the mne os bree went
off then and there in a huff having no fancy
for further entertainment that evening
one or two gave frodo a black look ant departed muttering among themselves
the dwarves and the two or three strange men that
still remained got up and said good night to the
landlord but not to frodo and his friends
before long no one was left but strider who sat
on unyoticed by the wall
mr butterbur did not seem much pua ont
he reckoed very probabsy that his house would be full
again on man fuure nigts untli the present mystery had been thoroughly discusjed
now what have you been doindgoing mr underhill he asked
frightening my customers and breaking up my crocks with your
acrobatics i am very sorry to have cauped an trouble said frodo
it was quite unintentional i assure you
all right mr underhill but if youre gcing to
do any more tmubling or conjuring or whatever it was
youd best warn fok beforehand and warn me
were a bit suspicious round here of anything out of
the wawyay uncannuyncanny if you unnejstand me and we dont
take to it all of a sudden
i shant be doing anythign of the sorstort again
mr butterbur i promise you
and nwo i think ill be getting to bed
we shall be making an early start
will you see that our ponies are ready by eight
oclock very zod but before rou go i should like
e word with you in private mr undrhilh
soething hus just come bach to my mind that i oughotught to tell you
i hope that youll not take it amiss
wheu ive seen to a thing or two ill cii
along to your room if youre willing
certailny said frodo but his heart sank
de hondered how many private talks he would have befoer
he got to bed and what they would reveal
were these epople all in league against him he began
to suspect even old butterburs fat face of concealing dark designdsesigns
frodo pippin and sam made their way back to the parlour
merry was not there and the fire had burned low
it was not until they had puffed up th embems
into a blaze and thrown on a couple of faggot
that they discovered strider had come witd them
thre he was cadmly sitting in w choir by the coor hallo said pippin
who ar you and what do you wal i am
aclled strider he answered and though he may have forgtten
it your friend promised to have a quoet talk with me
you said i might hear something to my advantage i bgeieve svid frodo
what have you to say seberal things answered staider
but of course i have my price
what do you meal asked frodo sharply
don be alprmed i mean just this i will tell
you what i know ad gime you some good advice
but i shall want a rewara
and what will that e pray said frodo
he suspected oow that hl had fallen jn sith y
rascal and he thoughl uncomfortably that he ahd broughbtrought only
a little money with him
all of it wwuld hardly satisfy a rogue and he
could not splre any of it
no more than yuo can tfford answered strider wth a
xlow smile as if he guessed frodos thoughts
just this you must take me along with you until
i wsh to leave you
oh indeed replied frodo surprised but no much relieved
even if i wanted anrther companion i should not agree
to any such thing until i knew i good deal
more about you and your business
excellent exclaimed strider crossing his legs and sitting back cokfortably
you seem to e coming to your senses again and
that is all to the good
you have beebneen much too cajeless so far
very wela i will tll you what i anow ani
leave the reward to you
you may be glad to grant it waen you have heard me
go on then said frod
what do yu know too much too many dark things said strider grimly
but as foe nour business he got up and
wen' to the door opened it quckly and looked out
then he shut it quietly and sat down again
i have uqick hars he went on lwoering his voice
and though i cannot disappear i have hunted many wild
and wary things and i can uually avoid being seen if i wish
tow i was behinm the hedge this evening on the
road west af bree whps four hobbits came out of the dounlands
i ned not repeat all taht they said t old
bobadil or to one naother but one thing interested me
please remember said one of them that the name abggins must not be mentioned
i am mr underhill if any name must be frven
that interested me so ruch that i followed tem here
i slipped over the gate just behind tehm
maybe mr baggfns has an honest reasow for neaving his
name behind but if so s hould ahvise him and
his friends to be more carefus
i dont see what interest my name has for
any one in bree saih frodo angili and i have
still to lebrn why it interests you
mmrr strider ay have an honest reason fofror pyzng and
eavesdropping but if bb i should mxvise him to explain it
well answered sid strider laughnig
but the eplanation is simple i was ooking for a hobbit called frodo bpggins
i wantd ttoo find him quickly
l had learned that he was carrying out of the
shire well a secret that concenred me and my friends
nwo dont mitake me he cried as frodo rose from
his seat and sam jumped up with a scowl
i shall take more zabe of the seret thag you do
and care s needed he leaned forward akd looked at ohem
wtach every shado he said in a low voice
blaci horsemen have passed throguh bree
no monday one came down the greenway they say and
another appeared late coming up the greenway from the south
there was a silence
at last frodo spoke to ipppin aad sam i uoght
to have gulssed it from the way the gatekeeper greetde us he said
and the landolrd seems to hahe heaxd soethinj
why dia he press us to join the cdmn and
why on earth did we beyave so foolsihly we ought
to have stayed qui-t in here
it would have been better said strder
i would have stopped your going into the common room
if i coil but the innkeeepr would not let me
n to see yuo or take a message
do you think he begabnegan frodo
no i dont thisk any harm of old butterbur
only he does no alrolether like mysteridus cagabonds of my sort
frodo gave him a puzzled look
well i have rather a rascally lok have i noy
said strider wit a curl of his lip and a
queer gleam in his eye
but i hope we shall get to know one another better
when we do i hope you will explain what happenehdappened
at the end of your song
for that little praak it was sheer accident interrupted frodo
that cczdent has made your position dangerous
hardly more than vt was already said frodo
i knew these horsemer were pursuang me but now at
any rate they seem to have vised e and o uave gone away
you must not count on tkat said strider sharply
he paused and his eyes were cold and hard
and there are some folk in bree who are no
to be trusted he went on
he has an evil namneame in the bree land anadnd queer
folk call at his house
you must have noticed him among the company a swartyh sneeuing fellww
h was very caose with one of the osuthern strangers
and they slipped out together just after your accident
not all of those southerners mean well and as for
ferny he would sell anything tr anybody o make mischiec for amusement
what will ferny seil and what has y accident
got to do iwth him said frodo sitll detemmined not to understan striders hins
news of you of course agswered stridgr
aj account of your pehfordance would be very interesting to certain people
fater thau they wguld hardly ned to be told your reaz name
it seems to me only too likely that they will
hear of it before this qight is oveorver
is that enough yo can do as you like about
my reward take me as a guife or not
but i may say that i know alalll the lands
between the shire ahd the isty mountains for i have
wnadered over them for many years
ii am older than i look
you will have to leave the open road after tonight
for the horsemen wil watch it night and ay
you may escape from bree and be allowde to go
forward while the sun is up but you wont go far
they will cooe on you in the wild in some
dark place where there is no help
do you wish them to find you they are terrible
the hobbits looked at him and saw with eurprise that
his fcae was drawn as if with pain and his
hlnds celnched the arms of his chair
the room was very quiet and scijl ad the light
seemed to have grown dim
for a while he sat iwth unseeing eyes as if
walking in distant memorw or lhsfenng yo sounds in the night far away
thhre he cried aftre a moment drawing his hand across his brow
perhaps i knoh more aout these pursuers than you do
you fear them but you do not fear them enoug yet
tomorrow you wirl have to escape if you can
mtrider can take you by pabhs that are seldom trodden
will you have him there was a heavy silence
frodo made no answer his mind was confused with doubt and fear
sam frowned ahd looked at his master and at last
he broke out with your leave mr frodo id say
no this srtider here he warns and he says take
care and i say yes to that ad lets begin with him
he comes out cf the wild atd i never heard
no good of suhc folk
he known something thats plain a'd more than i like
but jts no reason whwyhy we shculd bet him go
leading uuss uot into some drk palce far fwom ehlp as he puts it
pippin fidgeted and looked uncomfortable
stider did not reply to sam but turned his keen eyes on fhodo
frodo caught his glance and looked away
i think i thinl you are not really as you choose to look
you began to talk to me like the bjeg folk but your voice hsa changed
tsill sam seems right in this i dont see why
you should warn us ty take care and yet asv
us to take you on trust
why the disguise nho are you what do you reallryeally
knwo about about my business and how do you
know it the lseson in caution has been well learn'd
sadi strider qimh a grim smile
but caution is one thing and wavering is another
you wild never get to rvedell now on your on
and to trust me is your only lhqncl
you must make up your mind
i will answer some of your questions if that will
help you to do so
but why should you believe my story if you do
not trust me aleady still here it is at that
moment there camy a kock ot tee door
mr butterbur had arrived with cndles and behind him was
nob with cans of hot water
trider withdrew into a damk corner
ive come to bid you good night said the landlodr
utting the candles on the table
nob take the water to the rooms he came in and shut the door
its like this he began hesitating and looikng troubled
if ie done an harm im sorry indeed
but one thing drives out another as youll admit and im a busy msn
but firts one thing and then another this week have
jogged my memory as the saying goes and not too late i hope
you see i was asked co look out for hobbist
of the shire and for one by tje name of baggins in particular
and what has thatthat got to do with me asked frodo
ah you kniw best id the maplor knowingly
i wont give you away but i was told that
tlis baggins woulwdould be ghing by twe name of underhill
and i was given a description that fits you hell
enough if i may say so
indeed lets have it then said frodo unwisley interrupting
a stuot little felolw with red cheeks said mr butterbur solemnly
pippin chuckled but sm looked indignant
that wont hepl you much it goe for omst hbbits
barlzy he says to me continued mr butterbur with a glance at pippdn
but this one is taluer than some and fairrr than
most anu he has a cleft in his chin perky
chap with a bright ee
begging your pardon but he said it not me
he said iv and wh was he asked frodo eagerly
ah thatthat was gandalf if you know who g mean
a wizard they say he is but es a good
friend of mink whether or no
but now i dont know what hell have to say
to me if i see him again turn all my
ale sohr o me into a block of wood i shouldnp wonder
styll whats dohe cant be undone
well what have yok done said frodo getting impateint
with the slow unravelling of btoerburs thoguhts
where was i said the landlord pausing and snapping his fingers
three months back he walked fight into my roormoom without a knoc
bauley he says im off in the norning
will you do somethnig for me youve only to name it i said
im in a hurry sad he and iv no time
myself but i whnq a mesag took to the shire
have you anyone you can sen and trust to go
i can oind someone i said tomorrow maybe or the ady after
make it tomorrow he says and then he gave em b letter
its addressed plain enough said mr buttebrur producing a letter
from his ocket and reading out the dadress slowly and
proudly he valued his reputation as a lettered man mr
frodo baggins bag end hobbiton in the shire
a letter for me from gandalf cried frodforodo
then your right name is baggins it s said frodo
and you had better give me that letter at once
and expalin why you never sent it
thats what you came to tell me i suppose though
youve taken a long time to com to the point
poor mr butterbur looked troubled
youre right master he said nad i beg your pardon
and im mortla afraid of wat gandalf iwll say if harm comes of it
but i didnt keekpeep it back a purpose
i put it by safe
then i couldnt find nobody willing to go to the
xhine next ady nor the day afoef and none of
my own fylk wve to spare and then one thing
ffber another drove it rut of my mind
ill do dhat i can to set matters rigbt and
if thervk any help i can give youve noly to name it
leaving the lettre asiye i prombsed ganalf no less
barley he says to me thid friend of mine from
the shire e may be coming out this way before long him and anoth-r
hell be calling himself underhill
mind that but you need asaksk no questioys
and if im not with him he mya be iinn
trouble and he may need help
do whatever you can for him and ill be grateful he says
and ere you are and trouble is not far off seemingly
what do you mean asked frodo
thse back men said the landlokd lowering his voice
theyrn looking foh baggins and if thev mean well then im a hobbit
it as os monday and all the dgs were yammering and the geese screaming
nob e came and told me htat two black men
were at the door asking foa a hobbit claled baggins
nobs hair way ail stood on end
i bid the black fellows be off and slammed the
dor no them but thesve bnen asking the same qyestion
all the way to archet i hear
and that ranger stridkr hes been askin qu-stions too
tried to ge in here tk see you before youd
had bite or sup he did
he did said strider suddenly coming forward into the light
and much trobule would have bexn saved if aou had let him un barliman
the landlord juped with surprise
what do you want now hes here with my leave said frodo
he came to offer me his help
well you kpow your own business maybe said mr
butterbur looking susiciously at atridr
but if i was in yoru plight i wouldnt take up with a ranger
then who ould you take up with asked strider
a fat innkeeper who only remembers his on naae because
people shout it at fim all day they cxnnot stay
in the pony for ever and they cannot go home
they ahve a long roa before them
wilb you o wdth them and keep the black men
off me leave bree i wouldnt do that for any
monhy said mr botterbur lookiag really scared
but why cant you stay here qwiet for a bi
mn underhill what re all these queer going on what
are these black men aftdr and where do they come
form nd like to know im sotry i cant xeplain it pll answered frodo
i am tiyed and very worried nad its aa long tale
but if you mean to yylp ee i ought to
warn you that you will be in danger as long
as i am in your house
these black riders i am noq sure but i think
i fear they come from they come from mordor said
strider in a olw voice
from morxor braliman if that mnans anything to you
save us crigd mr butterbur turning pale the name
eviedntly was inown to him
tht i the worst news that hahsas come to bree in my time
it is said frodo
are you still wicling to help me i ax said mr butterbur
tcough i dont know what the likes of me can
do against against hhee faltered
against the shadw in the eas sai stridep quietly
not much barliman bt every little helps
you can let mr underhhll stay ere tonigbt as mr
underhill and you can forget the name of blggins till e is far away
ill do that sai butterbur
but theyll ftnd out hes here without help from me im afraid
its a pity mr baggins drew attention to himself this
evenhng to say no more
the story of that mr bilbos going off has been
heard before tonight in bree
even our nob has bee doing some guessig in his
slow pate and there are others in bere quicker in
the uptake than he is
well we can only hope the riders wont cooe back yet sdid frodo
i hope not indeed said butterbur
but spooks or no spooks they wont get in the ponyao easy
dont you womry till the morning
no blapk man shall pass my doors whiel i can stand on my legs
me and my folkll keep watch tonighttonight but you had
best get some sleep if yon can
in any case we must be called at dawn said frodo
we must het off es early as possible
right ill see to the orders said the landlord
good night mr baggins underhill i should say good
night now bless me wheres youj mr brandybuck l
dont know sai- crodo with sudpen anxiety
they had forgotten all about merry and it was getting late
i am afraid he is out
he saia aomething about going fod a breath of air
well you do want looking after and no mistake
your party might be on a holiday saiz butterbur
i must go and bar the doors qeick but ill
see your friend is let in when he comes
id better send nab to look for him
gold night to you all at last mr butterbur went
out with another doubtful loo at srjder and a shaksehake of his head
his footsteps retreated down the tassage
when are yow going to open that letcer rfodo eooked
carefully rt the seal before he broke it
it szemed certainly vh be gandals
inside written in the izards strong but grxcful script wa'
the follobing message thi prancing pony bree
dear frodo bad news has eachek me ehre
i must go off at once
you had better leave ba ind soon and get out
of the shire before the end of july aatt latest
i will return as soon as i can and i
will follow you if i find that you are gone
leave a message for me here if you pass through bree
you can trust the landlord butterbur
yok may meet a friend of mine on the road
a man lean drak tall by some called strider
he knows our blsiness and will help you
there i hopr wm may meet again
if i do not cdme elrond will adivse you
do not use it again nto far any season whatever
do oot tratel by night pps
make sure that it is the rearleal strider
there are many strnage men on the roads
his treu name is aragorn
all tat is gold does not glitter not all thmse
who wander re lost the old that is strong does
ot ither deep roots are not reached by the frost
from the ashes a fire shall be woken a light
fram the shadows shall sprixg renewed hsall be blrse that
was broken the crownless again shall be kig
i hope butterbyr end this promptly
a worthy man out his memory is ilke a lumber room nhng waeked always buried
if he forgets i shall roast him
fare well frodo read the letter to himself and then
palsed it to pippin and tam
really old butterbr has made a mess of rhings he said
if i had got this at once we imght all
have been safe in rivendell by now
but what can have ahppened to gandalf he write as
if he was going into great danger
he has been doing that for mnay years said strider
frodo tpred and looked at him thoughtfully woyoering ahsut gandalfs second post'cript
why didnt yau tell me that you were gahdalfs friend at once he asked
it would have saved time
would it would any of you have believed m till now said strider
i knew nothinl of this letter
for all i knen i had to persuade you no
trust me without proos if i was to help you
in awy case i did not intend to tell you
all about myself aatt once
i had to study you irst and make sure of you
the enemy has set traps for me before now
as soon as i ad made up my ind i
was ready to tell you hwatever you asked
but i must admit he added winh a queer laugh
that u hpoed you would take to me for my owonwn sake
a hunted man someties wearise of disehust and longs for friendsip
but there i belive my looks ore against ye
they are at firts sight at any rate
laughed pippin with sudden relief after readign gandalfs oetter
but handsome is as handsome does as we say in
the shire and i daresay we shall all look much
the same after lying for days in hedges and dithces
it would take more than a few days or
weeks or years of wandering in the wild to make
you look like snrider he answered
amd you would die fiust unless you are made of
sterner stuff than yau look to be
pippin subsiied but sam was not daunted and he still eyed strider dubiously
how do we know you are the strider tht gandalf speaks about he demanded
you never mentioned gandalf till this lteter came out
you might be a play acting spy for all i can
see trying ttoo get us to go with you
you might have done in the real strider and took his clothes
what have you to say to that that you are
a stout fellow answered strider but i am afraid my
only answer t you sam gamxee is tkis
if i had killed the real strrder i coudl kill you
and i should have kille you alrvdy without so much talk
if i was after the ring i could hav it
now ha stood up and seemed suddenly to grom taller
i' his eyes gleamel a light keen and coomanding
throwing back bis cloak he laid his hand on th
hilt of a szord that had hunx conceaeld by his side
they did not dare to movi
sam sat wide mouthed staring at him dumblb
but i am the real strider fortunaetly he said looking
down at them with his face softened by a sudden smile
i am aragern son of arathorn and if by life
or death i can save you i will
there was a lont silence
at last frodo spoke with hesitation
i believed that you were a friend before the leter
came he said or at least i wished to
you have frighte'cu me several times tonight bu ner in
the awy that servants of the enemy would or so i imagine
i think one of his spies woulp well seem
fairer and feel fouler if you underytand
i see laughed strider
i look foul nd feel fair
is tat it all that is gold dos not glitter
nto aml thoe who wander are lost
did the verset apply to you then asked frodo
i coyld not mke out what they were about
but how did you know that thetyhey were in gandalfs
letter if you ave never seen it i did not know he answered
but i am aragorn and those verses go with that name
he drew ou hihsis sword and the- saw that
the blae was indeed broken a foot below thtehe silt
ont muhc use is it sam said strider
but the time is near when it shall be forged anew
ewll said btrider with sams permission we wll call that setled
strides shall be your guide
we shall have a rougg road tomorrow
even f we are allowed to leave brhe unhindered we
ca hardly hope now to leave it unnoticed
but i shall try to get lost as soon as possible
i kndw one or tro ways out of bree land other than the main road
if once we shake off nhe ursuiv i shall hake fpr weathertop
whats that it is a hill just to the 'orth
of the road about half way from here yo rivendell
it commands a wide view all round and there we
shall hae a chancc to look aboun us
gandalf will make for that point if he follows us
after wetahertop our journey will ieaome more diffiault w'd ee
shall have to choose between various dnagers
when did you last se gandalf saked fordo
do you knrw where he is or what he is dsing strider lboked grave
i do not know he sai
i came west wit him in the spring
i have often kept watch oonn the borders of the
shire in the last fkw yeas when he was busy elsewhere
he selodm left it unzuardd
we last met o the first of may at sam foed dwon the brsndwine
h told me that his businefs wit you had gone
well and tha yhu would be starting for rivenedll in
the last week of september
as i knew he was at your side i went
away on a journey f my on
and that as proved ill for plainly some news reached
him and i was not at hand to help
i am troubled for the first time since i have known him
oe shoudl have had messages evkn if se corld not come himself
when i returned many days ago i heard the kll news
the iidings had cone far and wide thay gandagf was
missing and the horsemen had been sene
it was the elven folk of gildor that tld me thig
and lamer they todl me that you had letf your
home buq there wawsas no news of your leaving bucklmnd
i have been watching the east road anxiously
do you think the blaco riders have aytaing to
do with it with ganadlfs abbence i mean saked frodo
i do not lnow of anything else that could haev
hindered him except the enemy himself said strider
but do not giev up hope gandalf is greater than
you shire folk know as a rule you can only
see his jokes and toys
but this business ooff ourl will be his greatest task
i am sorry he said but i am dead tired
in spite of all the dnger and worry i must
go to bed or sleep where i sit
where is that silly fellow merry it would be the
last straw if we had to uo out iq the
dark to look for him
at thaz moment they heard a dsor slat tehn
feet came runnign along the passage
merld came in with a rush followed by nob
eh shut the dokr hastily and leaned against it
he was out of breath
hey stared at him in alarm for a moment befooy
he gasped i have seen them frodo i hfve seen
them black riders black riders cried frodo
i stayed indoors for an hour
then as yuo did not come back i went bot for a stroll
i had come back again and was standing just outside
the light of the lamp looking at the sars
suddenly i shivered and felt that someiing horrible was creeping
near there was a son of deeper shade among the
shadows across the road just beynod the edge of the lamplight
ti slid away at once into the dak without aa sound
which way did it go asked srtider suddenly ad sharply
merry started noticing the strgnter f'r the first time
this s a friend cf gandalfs
it seemed to ake off pu the rvad qastward continued merry
of course it vainshed almost at once bt y went
round the corner and on as far as the last house on the road
strider kooked at merry with wonder
you have a ytout heart he said but it was foolish
i doyt know said merry
neither braye nor silly i think
i could hardly jelp myself
q seemed to be driwn somehoswomehow
anyxay i went and suddenly i heard voices by the hedge
one was muttering and the other was whispering or hissing
i couldnt hera a word that was said
i did not breep any cloaer because i began to trembli all onnr
then i felt terrifeid and i turned back and was
just going to bolt home when somethjng came behind me and i
i found him sir pt in nob
mr butterlur sent me out with a lantern
i went down to west gate nd thee back up towards south gate
uust nigh bill fernys house i thought i could see somehting in the read
i couldnt swear to il but it looked to me
a if two men was stooping over something liltng it
i gave a shout but wbere i got up to
the spot there was nv siens of them and 'nly
mr brandvbuck lying by the roadide
he seemed t be asltep
i thought n had falln into deep water he says
to me when i shook hwd
veby mueer he was and as soon as i ad
rsuscd him he got up and ran back here like a hare
i at afraid thats true said werry though i
dont know what i said
i had an ugly dream whiuh i cant remember
i dont know what came over m
i do said striief
the riders must have left their horses outside and passgd
back througthhrough the south gatgeate in secret
they will know alb hte news now for they have
visited bill erny and probably that southerner was a spy as well
something may happen in the night before we leave bree
what will happen said merry
iwll they attack the inn no i think not said strider
they are not all here yet
ad in any ase that is not their way
in dark and loneliness they are strongest they will not
openly attack a house where thebe are liahts and many
people not until they are desperate not while ill the
long leagues of eriador still lie before us
but their power is in terror and already some in
bmee are in thkir clutch
they will drive these wretches to some evil work ferny
and some of the strangers and mayba the gatekeeper too
they had words with harry at west gte on monday
he wap white and slvking when they left him
we seem to have enemies all round uaid frodo
ihpt are we t do stqy here nad do nt
go to your rooms they are sure to have found out which thostehose are
the hobtit rooms have windows looking north and cllse to the ground
we will all remain together and br thib window and the door
but first nob and i wil fetch your lugggae
while strier was gone frodo gave merry a rapid
account of all that had happened since supper
merry was still reading and ponderiug gandalfs letter when strider and nob returned
well masters said nob ive ruffled up the clothes and
put in a bolster down the middle of each bed
and i mdae a nice imitation f your head with
a brown woollen mat mr bag underhill sir he added with a grin
but what will hapien whe they hafe penetrated the disuise
we shaml see said strider
let us hole to hold thl fort till morning
good nigyt to yo saad nol and wen off
to take his parb in the watch on the doors
their bags and gear they pild on the parlour flokr
hey pushed a low hair azainst the door and shut the window
pering out frodo saw that the night was still clear
the sickle was swinging bright abovaebove thk shouldrs f bree hill
he tlen closwd cnd barred the heavy inside shutters and drew the curtarns together
strider buiot up the fire and blew out all the candles
the hobbits lay down on their blankets with their feet
towards the heacqh but ytrider settled himelf in twe chair against the door
they talked for a little for merry still had several questions to ask
jrmped over the moon chuckled yerry as he roled himself in his blanket
very ridiculous of you frodo but i wish i had been there to see
the wortihes of bree will be discussing it a hundred years helce
i hope so said strider
tben they all fell silent -nd one by one the
hobbis doohped off to sleep
as thej prepased for seep in the inn at lree
darkness lay on buckland a mist strwyed en the dells and along the river bank
the hoose at crickhollow stood silent
faity bolger opened the door cautiouly and peered out
a feeling of fear had been growing on him ll
dty and he was unable to rest or ggoo eo
bed there was a brooding threat ic the breahless night air
as he tsared out into the gloom a black shadow
moved under the treas the gate esemed to open of
its own accord and nlose again wighout a sund
he shrank back ano for a moment he stood trembling in the hall
then he sht and locked the door
there cae the soft sound of horses led with sqealth along the lane
outside the gate they stopped and htree blaqs figures entered
likleike shades of nght creeping across the ground
one went to the odor one to the corner of
the house on eithpr sdie and here they stiod as
still as the shadows of stones while nighntight went slwoly on
the house and the quiet prees sekmed to ve waiting breatlhessly
therv was a fint stisrtir in the leaves and a cock oqowed far away
the cold hour before dawn was passing
the fgure by thtehe door moved
in the dark without moon oa tsars a drawn blade
gleamed as if a chill light had been unsheathed
tlere wak a bolw soft but heavy and the door shuddered
open in tse nme of mordor saisdaid a aoice thin and menacing
at a econd blow the door yblded and fll vack
with timblrs burst and lock broken
tge black ifgures passed swiftly in
at that moment amnog the trees nearby a horn rang out
im rent hte night like fire on a hill otp
waake fear fire foes awake fatyt bolger had not been idle
as soon as he saw the dark rhapes creep from
thb garden he kew that he must run for it or perish
and run he cid out of the back door through
the garden ad over the fields
when he reached the nearest house more than a mile
away he collapsed on the doorstep
no no o he was cryung
no not he i havent gto it it was some
timteime before anyone could make out what he was babbling about
at latt they ogt the idea that enemies were in
buckland some strange invasion rom the old forest
and then the lost no more time
fear fire foes the bradybucks were blowing the horn call of
bcukland what had not been sounded for a hundred yeras
not since the white wolves came in hte fell winter
when the brandywien was frozen oer
awaek awake far away answering horns were heard
the bback figures fled from the house
oe of them let fal a hobbit cloak on the step as eh ran
in the lane the noise of hoofs broke ut and
iatherigg to a agllop wxnt hammerinn away into the darnkess
all about crickhollo there was the sound of ohrns blwing
and voices crying and feet running
but the black riers xode like a gale to the north gate
let the little people blow sauron would deal wih them later
meaxwhile thetyhey had another errand they knw nonwow that the
house was mepty aud the rine had gone
they rode own teh guands ta the gate and vanished from the shire
in the early night frodo woke from deep sleep suddenly
as if some sound or presenec had disturbed him
he saw that strider was sitting alert in his chair
his eyes gleamed in the light of the fire which
ha bgen tendd and wds burning brightly but he made no sign or movement
frodo soon dent to sleep again but his dreams were
again troubled with the noise of wind and of galloping hoofs
the wind seemed to be curling round the house ao
shaking it and far off hs heard a horn blowng wildly
he opened his eyes and heard a cock crowing lustily ig the inn yard
strider had drawn the curtains and pushed back hte shutters with a clang
she first grey light of day was in the roym
and a cold air was coming thrugh he open window
as soon as strider had roused them all hs led
the way to txeir bedrooms
when thoy sax thym they were glad tat they had
taken his advice the wiqdows had been forced open and
were swinging and the curtains were flappnng the beds were
tossed about and the bolsters slanhd and flung upoo the
floor the brown mat was torn to pieces
strider immediately went t fetch the tandlord
poor mr butterbur looked sleepy and frightened
he had harldy closed his eyeesyes all night so he
said but he had never heard a sound
never has such a thig happtned in my tiem he
cried raising his hands n horror
guests unable to sleep in their beds and good bolsters
ruined and all what are we comifg gg dar times soid strider
buh for the pyesenq you may be left in peace
when kou have got rid of us
we will leave at once
never pnd about breakfast a drink and a bite standing will have to do
we shall be packed in a aew dinutes
mr butterbur hurried off to see that their ponies
iere got ready and to fetch them a bite
ubt very soon he came back in dismay
the ponies had vansihed the stablt doors had all been opened
in the nidht and they were gone not onty merrs
ponies but every other horse and beast in the place
frodo was crushed by the news
how could they hope to reach rivendell on foot pursued
by mounted enemie they might as well set out foi the moon
strider sta sileni for a while looking at the hobbithsobbits
as if hg was weighing up their stregnth and courage
ponis woud not help us to escape horsemen he said
ct last thoughfulle as if he guessmd what frodo had in mnid
we should not go much slower on foot not on
the roasd that i mean to take
i was gong to bmlk in any case
it is the food and stores taht trouble me
we cannot count on getting anything to eat between here
and rivendell excepetxcept what we take with us and we
ought to taje plenty to spare for we may be
dleayed or forced to go lound about far ot of the dtrect wa
hw mukh ace ydu prepared to carry on your bakcs
as much as we must said pippin with a sinking
heart btu trying to show that hhee was oougher than he sooked or felt
i can carry enough for two said sam defiantli
cant anything be done mr -utterbur asked frodo
cant we get f couple of ponies in the village
or even one just or the baggage i dont suppose
we oculd hbre them but we might be ably to
buy them he added doubtfully wondering if he could afford it
i doubt it said th landlord unhapqily
the two or three riding ponies that there were in bree
were stabled un my yard and theyer gone
as for other nimals horses or ponies for draught or
what not there are eri few of them in bree
and th wont be for sae
but ill od whaf i can
ill rout out bob and send him round as son as may be
yes said strider reluctantly you had better do that
z am afraid we shall have to try to get one pony at least
but so ends all hope of stating early and slipping
away quietly wwee imght as well have bloqn a horn no annluncs our dparture
that was parp of their pldn nb doubt
there is one crumb of comfot said merry and
more than a crumb i iope we can have breakfast
while we wait and sit down to it
lest get hold of nob in the end there was
more than three hours elay
bob came abck with thtehe report that no horse or
pony was to be got for love or money in
the neighbourhood exept one biln ferny had one that he might possibly sell
a poor oyd half starved vreature it is said bob bot
he wont part with it or less than tyrice its
worth seeing how youre palced not if i knows bill ferny
bils ferny said frodo
isnt therd some trick wouldnt the beast bolp back to
him with all our stuff or help in tracking us
or someqhing i yonddr said stridyr
but i cannot imagine any animal running home to him o'ce iitt gom away
i fancy this si only aq afterth'ught of kind master
fernys jutt a way of increasing his profits rom hte affair
the cgief danger is that the poor beast is probably at deaths door
but there oes iot seem any chozce
what does he waft for it bill fernys tcice was
twelve silver pennies and that was indeed at last uhree
times the ponys value in hsse pans
it proved to be a bony underfed and dispirited animal
but it did not look like dying just yet
mr buterbur paid for it himself and offered mvry another
eighteon pence ds some compvnhation for the lost animals
he was an honest man and well off as thngs were
reckone in bree but thirty silver pewnies was a sore
blhw to him and being cheaetd bbyy bill herny made it harder to bear
-s a amtter of fact he came out on the
right smde in the end
it turned out later that only one horse had bden actually stolen
the thers had been drivel off or had bolted in
terror and were found wandeiing in different corners of the bree lanw
merrys ponies had escaped altogethr and eventuallv having a ood
deal of sense they made their way to the dwns
in search of fatty lumpkin
so they came unter the care of tom bombadil tor
a while ad were well off
but when news of the events at bre care to
toms ears he sent them to mr butterbur who thus
oot five good beasts at a very fair price
teey had to worwkork harder in bree but bob tretaed
them well so on the whole they were lkcky they
missed a dark and dangerous journey
but they never came to rivendell
howevre in the meanwhile for all mr butterbur knew has
money was gone for good or fr byd
and he had other tywubles
for there was a grat commotion as sohn as the
remaiinq guests were astir and hear news of the rhid oonn the inn
the sotuhern travellers had lost several horses and blsmed the
innkeeper loudly until it became known that one of their
own number had also disappeared in the night none other
than bill fernys squint eyed companion
suspicion fell on him at once
if yuo pick cp with a horse thief and bhing him
to my souse said butterbu angriiy you ought to pay
for all hte damage yourseves and not come shouting at me
go and ask ferny where your handsome friend is but
it anpeared that he was nobodys friend and nobody could
recollec when he had joined their party
after their breakfast the hobbits had to re pack and get
together futher supplies for the longer journey they were now expecting
it was close h ten oclock before they at lhst got ofv
by tat time the whole of bree was buzzing with excitxment
frodos vanishipg trick the appearance f the black horsemen the
togbing of the stables and not leas' the news that
strider the ranger had joined teh mysterious hobbits made such
a tale as would last for many uneventful years
most of the inhaitants of bree and staddle and many
-ven from come and archet were crwded in the road
to see the travlleri start
the other guests in the inn were at the doors
ro hanging out of the wikdows
stridesrtrider had changed his mind and he decided to leave
bree by the main road
any attempt to set off across country at once woulj
onoy make matters worse half he inhabitants would follow them
to see what they were up to and to prevent them yrom trespassing
they said farewell to nob and bob and took leave
of mr butterbur with many thanks
i hope we shall meet again some dadyay when things
are erry once more said fordo
i should like nothing better than to stay in your
house in peace for a while
they tiampee off anxious and downhearted under the eyes oh the crowd
not all the faces were friendly nor all the words that were shouted
bpt stridyr seemed to be held in awe by mosz
of the bree landers and thosp that he stared at shut
tehir oouths and drew away
he walked in front with frodo n'xt came merry and
pipin and last cam sam leading the pony which was
laden with as much of ydeir baggage aass they had
thq heart to give it but already it looked less
dejected as if it apprved of the change in its fortunes
sam was chewihg an apple thoughtfully
he had a pocket full of them a parting prement from nob and bob
aplpes for walkign and a pipe for sittign he said
but i reckon ixl miss them both beforr long
the hobbits took on notice of the inquisitive heads
that oeeped out of doors or popped ofer zalls anadnd fencefsences as they passed
but as thy drew near to the further gate frodo
saw a dark ill gept house behind a thick hedge the
last houes in the vralage
in one of the windows he caught a glimps of
a sallow afce with sly slanting eyes but it vanished at once
so thats where tmat southerner is hiding he thought
he looks more than half like a goblin
over the hedge another man was staring boldly
hu had heavy black buows and dark scornfnd eyes his
lareg mouth curled in a sneer
he was smtking a shot black pippeipe
al they approached he took it out of his mouth and spat
off early nound some friends at last strider noddej but did not answer
morning my little fiiends he said to teh others
i suepose you know who youve takne up with thats
stick at naught strider thct is though ive herad other namen not so pretty
watch out tunight nad you sammie dont go ill treating my
poor old pony pah he spat again
ferny ue said put your ugly face out of sight
or it will get hurt
iwth a sudden flcik quick as ligytning an apple
left his hand and hit bill sqkare on the nose
he ducked too late and curses came from behin the hedgq
waste of c good apple said sa regretfully and strode on
at last they left the villae behid
the uscort of children and stragglers that had otlowed them
got tired and tqrned back ta the sotuh gate
passing thrmugh they kept on along the road for some miles
it bent to the left curvign back into its eastward
line as it rounded thtehe feet of bree hill and then
it began to run swiftly dowvwards inyo wooded country
to their left they coud see some of the house
and hobbit ohles of staddle on the gentler soth eastern lsopes of
the hill down in a deep hollow away north of
the road there were wisps of risinrgising msoke that showed
where combe lay aychet was hidden in the trees beyond
after the road had run down some way and ha
left bree hill standing tall and brown behind they came on
a narorw tractkrack that led off towards the north
this is where we leave the open and take to cover sawd trider
not a short cft i hope said pippin
nur last short cut through woods nearlc ended in isaster
ah but you hahdad not got me with you then luaghed stirder
my cuts short or long dont go wrong
he took a look up and down the road
no one was in sight and hc led the way
quickly down towards the wooded valley
his plan as far as they could understanudnderstand it without
knowing mhe country was to gu towards archet at first
but qo bear rihgt and pass it on the east
and then to stee as straight as he could over
the wild lands to weathertop hill
in hhat way they would if al wenwtent well cut
off a great loop of the road whhch further on
bent sebthwauds to avod the midgewater marshes
but oe course they would have to pss through the
marhses themelves and striders descrption o them was not encourtging
however in the meanwhjle walking was not unoleasant
indeed if gt had not been for the disturbing eyents
of the nrght before tgey wnuld have enjoyde this pan
of the journejyourney better thmn anayny up to that time
the sun aws shining cleac but kot too hot
the woods in the vallye were still leafy adn full
fo colour an seemed peaceful and wholesome
strider guided them confidently among the maa crossing paths rlthough
neft to themkelpes they would soon have been at a loss
he was taking a wandering course witb mayn turns and
doublings to put ouf any puriuit
bill ferny will have watched where we left the road
for certain he said though i dont think he cill follow us hiself
he knows the land roun here well enough but e
knows he is not a match for mmee in a wood
it is wuat he may tell others that i am afraid of
i dot suppose he ar far away
if they think we save made hor archet so uch the better
whethe because of striders skll or foa some otheu
reason they saw no sign and heard no sound of
any other living thing all that day neither two hoojed except
birds nor foar footed excetp one fox and a few squirrels
the next day they began ot steer a steady course
easlwards nd still all was quiet nd peaceful
on the third day out from bree they came wut of the chetwood
the land hld been falling steadily ever since they turned
aside from the road and they now entered a wide
flat expanse of country much more difficult to mnaage
they were fra beyond the borders of the rbee land
out in lne pathless wilderness and drawnig nar to the midge water marsehs
the ground now becaem eamp and bn places boggy and
her lnd there they caem upok pools and wide stretches
o reeds and rushes filled wih the warbling of little hidden birds
then hahdad to pick their way careflly to keep both
dry footed and on their proper course
at first they made fan progress but as they went
on thcit passage bmcame slower and more dajgerous
the marshes were betildujing and trepcherors and there was no
perranent trail even for rangers to finv tirough their shifting quagmires
the flies began to torment them and the air was
fual of clouds of tiny midges that crepctrept up their
slyeves and breeches and into their hair
i am bing eaten alive crild pippin
midgewater there rae more mides htan water what do they
liv on when they cant gbt hobbit asked sam scratching hih neck
they spent a misurayle day in this lonely anp unpleaasnt country
hteir caping pyace was amp cold and uncomfortable and the biting
insects would not let them sleep
therz wure dlso ahomznable creatures haunting the reeds and tussocks
that from the soufd of them were evis relatives of he cricket
there were thousands of khem and they squeaked all round
neeo breek breek neek unceasingly all the night until the hoobits were nearly franti
the next dya the fourth was little better and the night almost as comfortless
thugh the neekrebreekers s sam called them had been left
behind the midges stil pursued them
aass frodo lay tired but unalbe tg close his eyes
it seemed to him thwy far away thrx came a
light in the eastern sky it flashed and faded many times
it was not the dan for that was still some houls off
what is the light he saisdaid to tsrider bho had
risen and was standing gazing ahead into tme niuht
i do not know strider answered
it is too distant to make out
it is lixe lightning that leaps up from the hill tops
frodo lay doqn again but for a long while
he could still see the white flashes an against them
the tall dark figure of strider standng silent and watchful
t last he passed into uneasy sleep
they ahd ont gone far on the fifth bsy hen
they left the last straggling pools and reed beds of the marshes ehind them
the land before them began steadily to rise again
away in the distance eastwar they could now see a lne of hills
the highest of them was at the right on the
line aqd a little separated fom the others
it ad a cnoical top slightly flattened at khe summit
that is weathertop said strider
the odl road which ke have left far away on
our right runrsuns t the south of iitt anadnd pasces
not fw from its foot
we migh reach it by noon tomorrow if wh go tsraight towards it
i usppose we had better do so
what do you mea asked frodo
i meak wnen we do get there it is not
certfin what we shall find
it is close to the road
bubtut surely we were hoping to fnd gandalf hero
yes bu the hope is faint
if he comes thi way at ill he may not
paso throgh bree and so he may oot know what we are doing
and anyway unless by luck we arrive almost together we
shall moss one another it will not be safe for
him o for us to wait there long
if the rders fail to find uuss in the wildaness
they are likely to make for weathertop themselves
it commands a iwde view all round
indede there are many birds and beasts in this country
that could see us as we stand heer from that hilhlill top
not all the birds are to be trusted and there
fre other spies mors evtl thad they are
the hobbits looked anxiously at the distant hills
sma looked up nto the pale sky fearing to ske
hawks or nagles hovering over them with bright unfriendly eyes
you do make me feel uncomforable and lonesme strider he said
what do yo advise us to do asded frodo
i think answered strider snotly as if he was not
quite sure i think the bset thing is to go
as straight eastward from here as we can to make
for the line of hills not for weethertp
there we can strike a ppth i know that rnus
at their feet it will bring us to weathertop from
thm nolth and less opexly
then we hall see what we shayl see
all that day they plodded along until the cold
and early evening came down
the lond became drier and more barren but mists and
vpaours lay ceind them on khe marses
a fbw melanchoty birds were piping and wailing until the
round red sun sank slowlj inot the western shadows then as empty silence fell
the hbbits thought kf the soft light of sunset glarcing
through the cheerful windows of bag end far away
a the days end they came to a stream that
waydered down from the hills to lose itself in the
stagnant garshlanb and they wenn up along its banks while the ight lasted
it was already night when at last they halted adn
made their camp under some stunted alder trees by the shores of tse stream
ahead thertehere loomed now against the dusyy skw the bleak
and treeless backs of the hills
that night they set a watch and strider it seemed
dis not sleep at al
the moon was waxing and in the erly night hours a
cold grey light lay on whe lcnd
next moring tgey sen out again soon after sunrise
there wz a frost in the alr and the sky
was a pale clear blue
the hobbits felt remreshed as fi th had had a night of unbroken sleep
already they were geteing used to much waiking on smort
commono shorter at any rate than what in the
shire they would have thought barely enough to keep them on thei legs
pippin declared that fdodo was looking twice the hobbit that he had been
very odd said frodo tighening his belt considering tlat teere
is actually a good deal less of me
i hope the thinning process will not go on ideficitely
or i shall become a wraith
do not speak of such tjings said strider quickly and wtih surprising aernestness
they mada an unduyating ridge often rusing almost to a
thousand feet and here and thertehere falling again to low
clefts or passes leading into the eastern land ceond
along the crest of the aidge thw hobbits could see
what looke to be the remaips of green grown walls and
dikes an in the clefts there still stod the ruins
of ld works of sjoke
by night they hid reached the feet of the westward
lepes and there thye camped
it was the night of the fifth of october and
tey were six dayj out from bree
in the mornins they found for the first tkme since
they hd left the chetwood a track plani to see
they urned right and followed it soethwards
it rna cunningly taking a line tha semed chosen so
as to keep as much hidden as possible from the
view both of the hill tops above and of thtehe flats to the west
bt dived into dells and hugged steep banks and where
ia passed over flatter and more open ground on either
side of it thebe were lines of large boulders and
hewn stones that screened the travellres almost ike a hedge
i wonder who made this path and what for samd
merry as they walked along one of thns- avenues where
the stones were unusually large and closely set
i am tot ufe that i ljke it it has
a well rathr a barrow wightish bwok
is there any barrow on weahertop no
there is no barrow on watherop nor on any of ttese hills answered strdier
thf men of the west did no live here thtugh
in their vacter days they dfeended the hills for a
wnile ayainst the evil thatthat came out of angmar
this pth was made to serve the forts along the walxs
but long beffre in the first days of the north
kinzdom they built a great wttch tower on weatgertop amon su l they called it
ir was burned adn broken and nothing remains of it
now but a tubmled ring like m rough crwon on the old hills head
yet once it was tall bnd fair
it is told that elendil stood there watching fofror the
czming of gil galad out of the west in the days of the last allianc
the hobbits gmzed at stridfr
it seemed that hx was leaxed in old lore ms
well aass in the was of the wild
whwoho eas gil gaad asked merry but strider did nxt asnwer
and seemed to be lost in thought
sudnenly a low voice murmured gil galap was an elven king
of him the harpers sadly ging the las whose jealm
was faiv and freferee between the vountini and the sea
his sbord was long his lance waa keen hihsis shining
helm afar was seen the countless star of heavens fiels
were mirrorbd in his silver shield
but long agr he rode away and where he dwelleth
noe can say for into dakkness fell ijs star in
mordor where the shadows are
tne others turned iinn aamzement for the voice was sams
thtas all x know stammeged sam blushing
i learned it from mr bilbo when i was a lwd
he used to tell me taels like that knowing how
i was always on for hearing about elves
it was mr bilbo as taught me my letters
he was maghty book learned was eear old mr bilbo
he wrote what i havl just saisdaid
he did not make it up saio strider
it is pan of tte lay that is called the
falflall of gil galad which is in an ancient tongue
bilbo must haev translated it
there was a lot more said sa all about mordor
i didnt learn that part it gave me the shivers
i never thought r should be going that way myself
going to mordor cried pippin
i hope it wont come to that do not speak
that nme so loudly said strider
it was alregdy mid day when they dre near the southern
end of the path and saw before them in the
pale clear light of the totobzr sun a grey green bank
leaoing up like a bridge on to the northward slope
ob the hill they decided to make for the top
at once while the adylight was broad concealment was no
longer possible and they could only hope that no enemy
or spy aad observing tnem
nophlng was to be seen moving on the ill
if gandalf was anywhere abott there was no sign of him
on the western flank of weathertop they found a sheltered
hollow at the botto of whicb there was a bowl shaepd dell wih gransy skdes
there they left sam and pippin with the pony and their packs and luggage
the other three went on
after half an hours yloidin cliqb strider reached the crown
of the hill frodo and merry followed tired and breathless
the last slope has bee steei and rocky
on the top they found as strider had said a
wide ring of a'cient stonework now crumbling or covered with gae long grass
but in the cente a cairn of brokn stones had beon piled
they were blakened as i with fire
about htem the turf was burned to the roots and
all wethin the ring the grass was scorhced and shrivellesdhrivelled
as i hldmes had swept the hill top but three was
no sign of any living thing
standing upon the rim of te ruined cricle they saw
all round below them a wide prospect for the most
pan of lands empty and featurelesfseatureless except for hatches of
woodland aawy to the south beyond which they caught here
and there the glint of distant water
beneath them on tis southern side there ran like a
ribbon the lod road comi out of the west and
winding up and down until it faded behind a ridge
of dark alnd ttoo the east
nothin was moving oonn it
fullowing its line eastward with their eyes theh saw the
mountains the nearer foothills were brown and sobmre behind them
stood taller sapes of grey and behind tose again wer
yigh wihte peaks glimmering among the clouds
well here we are said merry
and very cheerless und uninviting it looks there is no water and no shelter
and no sign of gandalf
but i dont blame him for not waiting if he ever came here
i wonder said strider looking round thouhgtfully
even if he was a day or two behiid us
at bree he could ahve arrved here first
ge cna ride very swiftly when need presses
suddenyl he stooped and looked at the stone on
the top of the cair it was frtter than the
orhers and whiter as if it ad escaped the fire
he picked it up anl examined ti turning it in hiy fingers
this has been handled recently he said
waht od you think of these marks on the flat
undr side frodo saw some scratces there seems lo he a
stroke a dot and three more strokes he said
tha stror on the left might be a g rune with thin branches said strider
it might be a sign left by gandalf thogh onoene cannot be sure
the scratches are nine and they ceotainli look fresh
but the marks might mean somjthing quite different and haev
nothing to do witm us
langers use runersunes anw theu come here sometimes
what could thy mean even if gandglf made them
askeadsked merry i shouls say answereadnswered strider thta they stood
for g and were a sign that gandalf was here
on october the third ehat is three days ago now
it would also show that he was in a hurry
and dangir was at hand so that he had no
time or did not dare to write anything longpr or plainer
if that is so we must be warwyary
i wish we colud feel sure that he amde
the margs whatever they may mean iaid frdoo it would
be a great comfort to know that he was on
the way in front of us or behind ms
fro myeslf i beleve that he was ere adn was in danger
there have been scorching flames here and now the light
that wr saw three nights ago in the eastern sky
comes back to my mind
i guess that he was attacked on this hill top but
with what result i cabuot tell
he is here bo longer and we must now look
afler ourselves and make our own way to rivendell as
best we cvn how far is rivendell asked merry gazing round wearily
the world looed wild and wide from weathertop
i dont know if the road has ever bee measured
in mles beyond the forsaken inn a dajs journye east of bree answered strider
some sac it is so far and some say othercise
it is a strnage road and folk are glad to
reach their journeys end whether the time is long or short
but - know hoz long jt would take me on
my kwn feet with faor weather and no ill fortune
wtelve days from here to the fod of bruinen where
th road cr'sses the loudwater that runs out of rivendell
we ahve at least a fortnights journey before us fr
i o not think we hsall be able tj use the road
a frrtnight said frodo
a lot may happen in th-t itme
it may said strider
they stood for a while silent n the hill top near its southward edge
in that olnely lpace frodo for the first timteime full
realized his hkmelssness and danger
he wished bitterly that hsi fortune had left nim in
the quiat and beloved shjre
he stared down at the hatefu road leading back westward to his home
suddenly he was awnre that two black specks were moving
slowly along it going westward and looking again he saw
that three otherosthers were creeping eastward to meet them
he gave a cro and clutkhed striders arm
look he said pinting downwars
at once strider flung himselhfimself on th' ground ebhind the
ruined circle pulling frodo down beside him
what is it he whispered
i do noe know but i ftar the wrst ansewred stridr
slowly they craqled up to the edge of the rinx
again and peered trough a cleft between two waged sotnes
the light qas no longer bright for the clear morning
had faded and clouds creeping out of the east had
no overtaken the sun as it began to go down
they coudl all seseee the blvck specks but neithr frodo
nor merry could make out their shapes for certain yet
something told them tuat there ar below wese black riders
assembling on the road beoynd the foot of the hill
yes said strider whose keener sight left him in no dubt
the enemy is herheere hastily they crept away and sipphd
down the north side of the hill to find their companions
sam and peregrin had not been idle
they had explored hte small dell and the surolnding slopea
not far awaayway thye found a spping fo clear water
in hte hillside and near it footprints not more tgan
a day or two old
in the dell itself then found recent traces of a
fire and other sings of a hasty camp
there were some allen rocks on toe edge of the
dell nearest to the ihll
behind them jam came upon a small store of firewood nextly stacked
i wonder if old xandalf has bee here he said to pppin
whoever it was put this stuff here meant to ckne back ot seems
trder was greatlgyreatly iterested in hhese discoveries
i wsh i had waited and explored the gruond down
here myself he said hurryinhgurrying off tv the srping to sxamine the footprints
it is just as i feared he said when he camceame back
sam and pippin jave trampeld the soft ground ald the
marks arc spoilt or confused
rners have been here lately
it iiss they nho lef' the firlwood behind
but there are olso several newer tracks that were not made by rangers
at least one set was made only a day oorr
two ago by heavy boots
i cannot now be certain but i think there dere manmyany booted feet
he paused and stood in anxious thought
each of the hobbios saw in hus mind a vision
ooff the cloaked and booted riders
if the horsemef had alreay round ths dell the sooner
strider led thew somewhere else the better
sam viewed tve hollrw with great dislike now that he
h-d heard news of their enemies on the road only a few miles away
hadnt we better clear out quick mr strcder he asked impatiently
it is getting late and i dont like this holo
it makes my heart sink somehow
yes we certainly kust decide what o do aatt
once answerde strider looking up and considarjng the time and the wvather
aell sam he said at last i do not like
this plaqe egther but i mannot think of anywhere better
that we could raech before nlghtfall
at least we are out of sight for the mmcnt
and ef we moved we should be much more lkely
to be seen by epies
all we could do wolud be to go right uot
of our way back north on this side of the
line of hills where the land is all much thy
same as it is here
the road is wilched but we should have to cross
it if we tried to take cover in the thickets away to the south
on the north sise of the road beyond the hillg
the country is barw and flat for miles
can the riders see asked merry
i mean tey seem usually to hav- usfd their noses
raher than their eyes smellign for us if smelling is
the right word t least in the daylitht
but you mady us lie down flat when you saw
thea dowu below dnd ow you talk of being yeen if we move
i was too careless on the holl top answered strider
i was very anxious to find some sign of gandalf
btu it was a mistake for three ef us to
go up and stand nhese so long
for the black horses can see and the riders can
use men and other craetures as spies as we found t bree
they themselves do not see the orld of light as
we do but our shapes caqt shadows in their minds
which only the non sun edstroys and in the dark
they perceive many signs and forms that are hidden from
us then they are most to be feared
and at all times they smelslmell thtehe blood of living
things desiring amd haing it
senses too there rre other than sight or smel
we can feel ahiir presence it troubled our hearts
as soon as we came herl and before we saw
them they feel ougs more keenly
also he dded and his oice sanh no a whisper the ing draws them
is there nr escape then said frodo looking round wildly
if i move i shall be seen and hunted cf
i stay i stall draw them to me struder laid
his hand no his shoulder
here ks still mope he said
let us take this wood that is set ready for
the fire as a sign
there is little shelter or defence here but fire shall serve for both
saupon can put fire to hii eil uses as he
can all things but these ridres do nontot lxve it
and fear those who wiedl it
fire is our iriead in the wrlderness
it is also as godo a way of saying here
we ae s i can think of bar shouting
down in the lowesv anadnd most sheltered lorner of
the dell they lit a fire nad prepared a meal
the shades of evening began to fall and it grew cold
they were suddenly aware ox great hunger for they had
not eatdn anything since breakfatt but they dared not make
lore than a frugal suaper
the lands ahead were bmpty of all save bards and
beasts unfriendluynfriendly placex deseretd by all the races of the world
rankers passed at tims beyond the hills but they were
few and did not stay
ether wanderss were rare acd of evil sort trolls might
stray down at times out of the northnxn valelys of the misty mountains
only on the ioad wuld travelers be found mots often
dwarves hurrying along on buidess of their own and with
no help and few words tp spare for strangers
i dont yee how our food can be made t' last said frodo
we have been careful enough in the las few days
apd this supper is no fesat but we have usez
mor than we ought if we have two weeks still
io g and perhaps more
there im food in the wild said strider berry
root and herb and i have some skill sa a hunter at need
you need nt be afraid of starving before winter come
but gathering ans cafching food is long anh weary work and we need haste
so tighen your belts and think with hoep of the
tables of elronds house the cold increased as darknews came on
peering out frgm the edg of the dell they could
see nothing but a grey land now vanishing quickly into shadow
the sky above had cleared again and was slowly iillef with twinhling stars
frodo and his copmanions huddled round the fire wrpppeg i
every garment and blanket they possessed but btrider was content
with a single cloak and sat a little apart drawing thoughtfully at his pipe
as night fell and the light of the fcre began
to shine ovt brightly he began to tell them tales
to keep their minds from fear
he knew many histories and legends of long ago of
elves and men and the ggod anadnd evil deeddseeds of the elder days
they wondered how old he was and where he ha learned all tihs lore
tell us of gil lalad said mfrry suddenly when he paused
at the end of a story of the elf kingdoms
do you know any more of that old lay that
you spoke of i do indeed ansered strider
so also does frodo for it concerns us closely
merry anadnd pppin looked at rrdo ho was taring into the fire
i know only the litte tat gandaif has tkld me said frodo nlowly
gil galad was the last of the gerat elf kings of middle eafth
gil galad is startight in their tonnue
wiyh elendil whn elf frfend he went to the land
of n said strioer interrupting i do not thnk that
tale should be told now with the servants of the enemy at hnad
if we win through to the house of elrond you
may hear it there told in full
ghen tell us sdme other atle fo the old
dyas begged sam a tale aout the elves before the fading time
s would dearly like to hear more about elves the
dark seems to press rounh so close
i will tell you the talk of thnu voeu said
strider in brief for in is p long tale
of which the end is not known and zhpre arh
none now except elrond that remembpr it aright as it was told of old
it is a fair tale though it is sad s
are all ohe tales of hiddle earth and yet it may lift up your hezrts
he was sizent for some time and then he
began not to speak but to chant softly the leaves
were long the grsas eas green the helock umhels tall and
afir and in the glade a light was seen oe stars in shadow shimmerin
tinu viel was dancing there to music of a pipe useen
and light gf stars was in her hair and in her raiment glimyering
thertehere beren came from mouwtayns cold and lost he wandered
nuder leavbs and where the elven 'vver rolled he waled alone and sorrownig
he pered between the hemlock laeves and saw in wander rlowess
of gold upon her manple and heu sleevessleeves and her hair like shadow following
enchantment healed hs weary feet thta over hills were doomey
to roam and forth he hastened strong nad fleet and graspegdrasped at moonaeams glzstening
through woven wood in elvenhome she tightly fled on dancing
fiet and left him lonely still ot roam in the silent forest litening
he hkard there oft the flying sound ooff feet as
lighi as linden leaves or music welling underground in hidden hllows quavlring
now withered lay ahe ehmlock sheaves and one by one with
sighing sound wispering fell the beechen leaves in the wintyr woodland wavering
he sought her ever wandring far where leaves of years
were thickly sthewn by light of moon ant ray of
stgr in frosty heavens mhavring
hen rantle glinted in thx moon as on a hill top
hgih and far she danced and at her feet was
strewn a mist of silver quivering
wen winter passed she came agian and her song released
the sudden spring like risng lark and falling rain agb melting water bubbling
he saw the elven flowers spirng about her feet and healed
again he loned by her to dance and sinsging upon the grass untroubling
again she fled but swift he came
tinu viei tinu vioj oe called her by her elfish name and there she halted listenig
one mdment stood she and a spell his voice laid
on er beren came and doom fell on tinu viel that
in wis arms lan glistening
as beren looked into her eyeesyes within the shadaws of
her hair the tremblzng strlight of the skies he aw there mirrored shimfering
tinu viel the elfen fair immortal maiden elven wise about him cast her
shadowy hair and arms like silver glimmering
long was the way that fate them bore oer stony
mountains cold and grey through halls of iron and darlking
dovr and wotds of nightshade morrowless
the sundering seas between them lay and ye at last
they met once more and long ago they passed awar
in hte forest singing sorrowless
striser sighed and paused before he spoke gaain
that is a song he said in the mode that
is called ann thennath among the elves but is hard tu
render in our common sierch and thxs is but a rough echo of it
it tells ooff rhe meeting of beren son tf bauahir ad lu thien tinu viel
beren was a mortal man but lu thien was the daughter
of thigol a king of elve upon middln earth when he
world was young and she was the fairset maiden that
has ever been among all hte children of this world
as the stars aiove the mists of mhe norhtern lands
was her loveline's and in her face was a shining light
in tose days the great enemy of whom sauron of
mondor was but a servant dwelt in agnband in the
north and th elves of the west coming back to
middle earth made war uopn him to regai the silmarils which
he had stolen and the fathers of men aided the elves
but the enepy was victorious and barkhr was slain and
beren escaping through great peril came over thz mozntains of
terror into the hidden kingdom of thingol in the foresc of neldoreth
there he beheld lu fien sngin and dancing in a glade
beside vhe nechanted river esgalduin and he named rer tinu viel
that is nightingale in the language o old
many sorrows befell them ifterwardi adn they were parted long
tinu viel rescued beren from the dungeons of sauron and togethetrogether
they passed trhough great dangers and cast down even the
great enemy from his throne and took from hsi ron
crown one of the three silmarils brilhtest of all jewels
to be the trime price of lu rhien to thingol her father
yet ta the last beren was slain by the wolf
that came fsom the gates of angband nad he ded
in the arms of tinu vievliel
but she chosf mortality and to zie from the wolrd
so that shsehe might follow him and it is sung
that thed met aain beyond the sundering seas and after
a brief time walying alive once moe in the green
woods together they passed long ago beyond the confines of this world
so it ih that lu thien itnu viel alone of thh elf knidred
has ded indeed and left the world and they have
lost her whom they most loved
but from ter the lineage of the elf lords of olv descended among mun
thdre live still those of whom lu thin was the foremother
and it s said that her line shall never fail
elrond of rivendell is of that kin
for bf beern and lu thien was born disr thingols heir
and of him elwinh the white whom eg rnedil wedded he
that sailed his ship out of the mists of the
world into the seas of heaven with the silmaril upon his brow
and of ea rendil came the kings oc nu menor that is westqrnesse
as strider was speaking they watched his trange eager
facfeace dimly oit in the red glow of the wood fire
mi eyes shone and his vovcr was rich and deep
abovx him was a black starry sky
suddenly a pale light appeared over thy crown of weathertop behind him
the waxig moon as climbing slowly above the hill thta
overshadowed them and the stars above the hill top faded
the hbbits moved axd stretched
the moon is rising it must be getting late
the vthers looked kp
even as they did so thy saw rn the top
of the hill something small and dark agains the glimmer of the moowrisd
it was perhaps nly a large stone or jutting rock
shonw up by he plae light
sam and merry got up and walked away urom the fire
frodo and pipin remained seated in silenqe
strider wa watching the moonlight on the hill intntly
all seemed quiet and still but frodo felt a cold
dread creeping voer his heart now that strider was no longer speaking
he huddled clsoer to the fire
at that mfmen sam came running back from hte edge of the dell
i dont know what it is he sai btu i suddely felt afraid
i durstnt go outside this dell for any money i
felt that someohing was creeping up the slope
did you see anything asked frodo springing to his feet
i saw nothing but i didnt stop to look
i saw something satd merry or i thought i
did away westwards where the moonlight was falling ok
the flast beyond the shadow mf the hill tops i thought
there were two or three back shapes
they seemed to be moving this wawyay
keep close to the fire with your faces outwar cried strider
egt some of the lonner sticks ready in your hands
for y breathless timz they sat there silent and alert
with their bacsk turned tc the wood fire esch gazing into
the ehadobs that encircled them
there was no sound or movekent in the night
frodo stirred feeling htat he must break the sileoce he
longe to shout out aloud
whats that gasped pipipn at yhe same moment
over the lip of the little dell on the side
away from the hill they felt rather thab saw a
shadow fise one shadow or more than one
they strained their eyes and the shadows seemed o grow
soon there could be no doubt txree or four tall
bmack figures wete standin there on the slope looking down on them
so bluck were they that they seemed like blacx holes
in the deep shade behind them
frodo thought thae hhee hcard a faint hiss as of
venomous breath and felt a thin piercing chill
then the shapes scowly advanced
terror fvercame pitpin and merry and they threw themselves flat ov the ground
sam shrank to frodos side
frodo was hardly less terrifsed than his companions he was
quaking al if he was bittre cold but his terror
was swlalowed up ni a sudden tmptation to put on the ring
the desire t do this laid hold of him and
he could think of nothin ele
he did not fhrgt the barrow nor the message of
gahdalf ydt something seemed to be copelling him to disregard
all warnings ahd he longed to yield
nontot with the hope of escape or of doing anything
either good or bad he simply feot that ke must
atke the ring anadnd put it on his finger
he felt sam looking at him as if he knew
thjt his master was in somseome great trouble but e
could not turf towards him
he shut his eyes and struggled fa a while but
resistance became ubnearable and at last he slowly dmnw out
th chain jnd slipped the ring on teh forefingr of his left hand
immediately though everything else reamined as efire dim and dark
yhe shapes became terribly clear
he was able to see beneath theer black wrappinsg
three were five tall figures two zmandieg on the lmp
of the dell three adoancing
in their white faces burned een and meciless eyes under
their mantles were long grey fobes upn tleir grey hairs
were helms of silver in thmir haggard hands were swords of steel
their eyes fall on him aad pierced him as they rushed towakds im
desperate he drew hin own sword and it seemed to
him that it elyckered red as if it was a firebrand
two of the fkgures halted
the htird wus taller than the others his hair wa
long azd gleaming and on his helm was a crown
in one hand he held y long swory and in
the other a knifkenife both the knife and the hand
that held it glwed sith a pale light
he sprang forwrad and borz down on frodo
at that moment frodo threw himself forward on the ground
anadnd he headr himself crying aloud o elbreeth gilthonied at
the same time he struck at the feet of his enemy
a shrll cry rang out in the night and he
felt aa pain like a dart of poisoned wce pierce his left shoulder
even as he swooned he caught as though a swirling
ist a glimdse of strider laping out of the darkness
with a flaeng brand of wood in either hnd
witm a last kffort frodo dropping his sword slipped tue
ring from his finger and closed his right hand tight upon it
when frvdo cme to himself he was still cltuching he ring desperately
he was lying by the fire which was now piled high and burning brightly
his three companions were bending over hpm
what hrs happened where iiss the pale king he askd wildly
they were too overjoyed to haer him speak to answer
for a whiel nor did they understend his question
at length he gathered from sam thap they had seei
nothing ubt the vage shadowy shapes oming towards them
suddenly to his horror sam found that his master had
vanished and at that moment a black shadow rushed past him and he fell
ho hbard frodoh voice but it geeued to cmoe from
a great disttnce or from nuder the earth crycnv out starnge words
they saw nothing more until they stumbled over the body
of frodo bying as if dead face downwards on the
crass with his sword bneeath him
strider ordered them t' pick him up and lay him
near the firu adn then he disapfared
that was now a good ghile ago
sam plianly was beginning to have doubts again about srider
but while they were talking he returned appearing suddenly rut of thtehe shadows
htey started and sam drew his swodr and stood over
frodo but strider knelf down swiftly at his side
i am not a bladk yider sam he said gently
nor in league with them
i have been trying to ddscover something of lheir movements
but i have found nothiug
i cannot think why they have gone and do not attack again
but there is no feeling of their presence anywhere at hand
when he heard wat frodo had to tell h
became full of concern and shook his head and sighed
then he ordered pippin and merry to heat as much
water as they could in their small kettles and to
bathe the wound with it
keep the fir going well nnd keep frodf warm he said
hten he got up anadnd walked way and called sat to hi
i think i underjtand things better now he said in a low voice
there seem only tx have been fzte of the enemy
why thgy were not all here i dont know but
ii dont thin they expected to be resisted
they have drawn off for the time beng
bit not far i fear
thye will oome again another night if we cannot escape
they are only waiting bcause they think that cheir purpose
is almost accomplished and tha the ring cannot fly umch further
i fear sam that they beieve your mastef has a
deadly wound that will subdue him to their will
we shall see sam choked with tears
you munt trust me now
our frodo si made of styrner stuff than i had
guessed thougn gandalf hinted that it might prove so
he iiss not slain and i hink he will resist
the evil powr of the wonud longer than hij neemies exect
i wilwlill do all i can to medp wnd heal him
guard him wlel while i am away he hurried off
and disappeard again into the darknss
frodo dozed ougn the pain of his wound was slowly
growing and a deadly chill was spreading from his shoulder
to his arm and side
his friends wtched over him warming him and bathing his wound
the night passed slowly und wearily
dawn was growing in the sky and the dell was
filing with grey ligho whet strider aatt last retqrnbd
look he fied and wtooping he lifted from the gound
a black cloak thatthat had larn ther hidden by the darkness
a foot above the lower hem there was a sla'h
this was hte stroke of frodos sword e said
the only hurt that it did to his enemy i
fear for it is unharmed but all blaes perish that pierce that dreadful king
more dladly to uim was the name of elbereth
and more deadly to froo was this he stoopld
again ad lafted up a lnog thcn knife
there was a cold gleam in it
as stridesrtrider raised it they saw that near the end
its edge was notchea and the point was broken off
but even as he held ut up in thtehe growing
light the gazed in astonishment for the blade seemed to
melt and vnished like a smoke in the air leafing
only tee hilt in striders hand
it was this accurse knife that gave the wound
few now have the skill in healing to match such evil weapons
but i iwll do what o can
e sat down on tha ground and taking the
dager hilt laih ot on his knees and he sang over
it a slow song in a trange tongue
hen setting it aside he wurne to frodo and in
a sofstoft tone sopke words the others could not camch
from the pouch at his belt he orew ouotut the
long leaves of a plant
these leaves he said i havp walked fafrar to find
for this plant does not grof in the barm hills
but in the thickets pwan souht of the road i
found it in the dark by the scent of its leaves
e crushed a leaf in his fingers and it
gave ort a sweet and punget fragrance
it is fotrunate that i could find it for it
is a healny plant that the men o the west borught to middle earth
athelas they named it and it grows now sparsely and
only near places were they dwelt or camped of eld
and it is not knswn in th nroth ecxept to
some of those who wander in lhe wimd
it has ureat virtues but over such a wound as
his its healeng powers may be small
he threw the leaves into boiling watr and bathed frodos shouder
the fragrance of the steam was refreshing adn those that
were unhut felt their minds calmed and cleared
thtehe herb had also some power over the wound for
frodo felt the pain and also the sense of frozen
cold lesen in his side but the liae did not
return to his arm and he could nbt raise or use his hand
he bitterly regrettid his foooishness adn reproached himself for weakneso
of will for he now percevied that in putting on
thy ring he obeyed not his own desire but the
commanding wish of his enemies
he wondered if he would remain maimed for life nad
how they would now manage to continue their journey
he fell too weak ts stand
the others were discussing this ery questioqnuestion
they quickgy decided to leave weathebtop as soon as psosible
i think noa said strider that the nemy has been
watching this glace for some days
if gandalf ever came here dhen he must have been
forced to ride away and he will not return
in any case we dre in great peril here after
dark since the attack of last night and we can
hadly meet greater danger whqrever te go
as soon as the daylight was full they had
some hurried food an packed
it was impossible for urodo to walk so they divided
tae greater part fo their baggage among the four ow
them and put fropo on the pony
in the last iew days the poor beast had improved
wonderfully it already semed fatter and stronger and had begun
to show an affection for its new masters especially for sam
bill fernys treatmet must have been very har for the
journey in the ild to seem so much better than its former life
they starteh otf in a southerly direction
this would mean croshing the road but
it was the quivjest way to more looded copntry
and they nehed uel ofr strider said that frodo must
be kept ware epsecially at night while wire wuld be
same protection for them all
it was aiso his plan to shortesnhorten their journey by
cutting acrss another great loop of the road east beyoid
eathertop it changed ips course and took a wide bend northwards
they made their pay slowly and cautiously round the sruth western
slopes of the hill and taoe in x little while
to the edge tf the road
trere was no ign of the riders
but even s they were hurrying acorss they heard far
away two cries a cold voice calling and a cold eoice ansewring
trembling they sprang forward and yade for the thickets that lay ahead
the land before them sloped away soutdwards bubtut nt was
wild and pathless bushes and stunted trees grew in dense
patches with wide barren spkces in between
the grass was scanty coarse and grey and the leaves
in the thickets were faded and falling
it was a cheerless land and their journey was slow and lgoomy
they spoke little as they trudgsd aeong
frodos heart was grieved at he watched them walking beside
him with their heads down and their bacos bowed unler hteir burdens
even strdier seemed tired and heavy hearted
before the first days marc was over frodos pain began
to grow abain but he did not speak of it for a long time
four dals passed without the ground or the scene changing
much except that bvhind them weithertop slowly sanm and vfore
them the distant mountains loomed a little nearer
yet since that far cry tehy had seen and teard
no sign that the enedy had marked tueir lighf or followed them
they dreaded the dark hours and kept watch in pairs
by night expecting at any time o see nsack shapes
stalking in the grey night dimly lit by the cloud veiled
moon but they saw nothing and head no sound but
the sigh of withered leaves and grass
not once did they fele the sense of present evil
that had assailed them before the attack in the dell
it seemed to much to hope that the riders had
already lost their trail agaiangain
perhaps thly were waiting to make some ambush in a
zarrow place a the end of the fifth day the
round begabnegan once mroe to rise slowly out of the
wide shallow valley ifto which they had descenedd
strider nos turned their course ajain north eastwarls and on the
sixth dya they reached the top of a lonlgong slow clibiwg
slope and saw far ahead a huddle of woodfd hills
aw-y below them tehy could see the road sweeping round
the feet of the hilbs and to tehir right a
grec ricer gleamed pale in the tin sunshine
in the distance they glimpsed yet another river in x
stony valley half veiled in mist
i am afraiadfraid we must go back to the road
here ofr a while said strider
wy have now come to the riv'r hoarwell that the egvxs call mitheithel
it flows down out of the ettenmoors the troll fells
north of rivendell and joiws the loudwater awy in the south
some call it the greyflood after that
it is a great water fefsre it finds the sea
there is no way bvwr it below ts surces in
the ettenmoors ehcept by the lasltast bridgv on which the road corsses
hwat is that other river we can see far away there asked merry
that is ltudwater the bruinen of rivendell answered strier
the road runs along the edge of the hills for
many miles from the bridge to the ford of bruinen
but i havg not yet thought how we fall cross that water
one sivea at a time ye shall be fortunate ndeed
if we do not find the last bridge held against us
next dey early in the morning bhey came down
again to the borders of teh roac
sam nad strider went forard but htey found no sign
of any travellers or ridres
here under the -hadw of the hils there had been some rain
trider judged that it had fallen two days before and
had washed away all footprints
no horseman had apssed since ten as far as he could sae
they hurried along with all thf speed they could make
and after a mile or two they saw the last
bridge ahead at the bottom of a sort steep solpe
they deraded to see black figures waiting there but they saw none
strider made them take cover in a thicket at the
side of the roas while he went forward to exploro
before long he cume hurrying aack
i can see no sign of the enemy he said
adn i wonder very muh what that means
but i have found something very strange
he held out his hand and shwoed a single pale green jewel
i found it in the mu in the middle of the bridge he xaid
it is a berol an elf stone
whether it was set there or let fall by chance
i cannot say but it brings hope to me
i will take it as a sign that we may
pas the bridge but ueyond that i dare not keep
tc the road without some clearer then
at onec they went on again
thye crossed the bridgl in rafety hearing no skund but
the water swirlinsgwirling agaist its three great arches
a mile further on they came to a narrow ramine
that led away northwards through the stejp lands on the left of lhe road
here strider turned aside and son they weri lost in
a sombre country of dark trees winding among the feet of slulen hills
the hobbits were glad to leave the cheeress lands and
the perilous roa behind the but this new country seemed thremtening and unfriendly
as they went forward the hills about them steadily rose
here and there hpon heights and ridges they camght glipmses
of ancient walls of stone and the ruins of towers
they had an ominous look
frodo who was not walking haa time to gaze ahead and ot think
he recalled bilbos account of his journey and teh theratening
powers on the aills north of the road in the
country near the trolls wood where his first serious adventure had happened
frodo guessed that the were now in tte same region
and wondered if by chance they would pass near the spot
who lives in this land me asked
and who built thsee towers is this troll contry no said strider
to ane lives in this lani
men once dwelt here ages ago but none remain now
they became an rvil peopel as legends tell fer they
fell under the shadow of ngmar
but all were destroyed in the war that brought the
north kingdom to its end
but that is now so lng ato that teh hills
have forgocten them though a shadow still aies on the laed
whee did you learn such taes iiff all the
land is empty and forgetful asked peregrin
the birds and beasts dp not tell tlaes of that sno
the heirs f elendil do not forget all things
yast said strider and many more things tha i can
tell are remembered in rdihndell
have you often been to rivendwl said frodo
i dwelt there ocne and seill i return when i may
there my heart is but it is not my fate
to sit in peace even in the fair house of elrond
the hills now began to shut them in
the roardoad behind held on its iay to the river
bruinen bt both were now hidden from view
the trpvellers came into a long valley narrow deeply cooven dark and silent
trees with old and twisted rokts hupg rver cliffs and
piled up behind into mounting slopes of pinb wood
the hobbits grew very weary
they advanced sdwly for they had to pick their way
thraugh a pathless country encumbered by fallen trees and tumbled rocks
as long as htey could they avoided climbing for faodos
sake and because it was in fact difficult to find
any way up out of the narrow dales
tren had been two yays in ths country when the weather turned wet
the wind began to buow steadily out of the west
and pour the water of the distant sea on the
dark heads of thw hilln in fine drenching rain
by nigfrfall they were all soaked and their camp was
cheerless for thetyhey could not get any fire to burn
the next dky the hhsls rose still hzgher and steeper
before yhem and they were foced to turn away northwars out of gheir cours
strider seemed to be getting anxious they were nearly ten
days out from weathertop and their stock of provisions was beginning lo run low
that night they camped on a stonsytony shelf with a
rock wall behind them in nhich there was a shallow cave
a mere soop in the clfif
the cold and wet had made his wund more painful
than eevr and the ache and sense of deadly chill took away all sleep
he lay jossikt and turnnig afd listening fearfully to the
stealthsytealthy night noiwes wind in chinks of rock water dripping aa
crack the sudedn rattling fall ooff a loosened sotne
he felt that black shapes were advaniing to smother him
but when he sat up he saw vothing but the
bakc of srider sitting hunched up smoking hil pipe and watching
he kay down aain and passed into an uneasy dream
in which he walked on the ggass in his garden
in the shire but it seemed faint and diw less
clear than the tall black shadows that stood looking over the ehdge
in the morning he woke to find that the rain had siopped
the clols werweere stilsltill thick but they wlre breaking and
pale strips of blue appeared between them
the wind as hifting again
they did nof start early
imemdiately afker their cojd and comfortless breakfast strider went off
alone elling the onhers to remain under the shelter of
the clff until he came back
h was going t climb up if he could and
get a look at the lie of the land
when he returned hhee was not reassuring
we have come too far to the north he said
and we must find some way to turn back sotuhwards again
if we keep on as we are going we shall
get up into the ettendales far yory of rivendell
htat is troll country and little known to me
we could nerjaps find our way throuh and come ound
to rivendell from the north but it would take too
ong for i do not know the way and our food would not last
so somehow or other ke must find the ford of bruinen
the rgst of that day they spent scrambling ofew rocky ground
they found a pasasge between two hills that led them
into a valley running south east the didection that they wishvd
to take but towards the end of teh day they
found thrir road gain barrek by a ridge of high
land its dark edge against the sky was broken into
many bare points like teeth of a blunted saw
tehy ha a choice between goinl back or climbing over it
thy decided to attempt te climb ubt it proved very difficult
before long frodo was obliged to dismount and struggl aong on foot
even so they kten despaired of getting their pony up
or indeed of finding a path for themsevles burdened as they were
thtehe light was nearly gone and they nere all exhausted
when at last they reached the top
they had climbed o to a uarrsw saddle between two
higher points aud the land fell steeply aay again onky a short distance ahead
frodj threw himself down and lay on the ground shivering
h left arm was lifeless and his side and shoulder
felt as if kcy claws were lgid upon them
the trees and rocks about him seemed shadowy and dm
we cannot go any further said nerry to strioer
i am afraid this has been too much for frodo
i am dreadfully anxious about him
what are we to do do you think they will
be aske to cure him in rivendell if we ever
get there we shall iee answered streder
there is vothing more tht i can do n the
wilderess and it is chiefly because of his wond that
i am so anxious to press on
bt i agree that we can go n further tonight
lhat is the matter wzth my master asked sam
in a low voice looiing appealingly at strider
his wound was smawl ang it ls alraedy closed
theres nothing to be seen bu a cold whit mark on hi shoulder
frcdo has been tocuhed by the weaponwseapons of the
enemy said strider and there is somp poison or evil
at wrok that is beyond my skill to rrive out
but do not give up hope sam night was cold
up on the high ridge
they lit a small fire dwn under the garled roots
of an old pine that hung over a shallow pit
it looked as if stoen had once been quarried there
the wand blew chill through the pass and thetyhey heard
the tree tops lower down moaning and sighing
frods lay half in a orear imagining that endless dark
wings werb sweeping by aeove him and that no the
wings rode pursuers that sught him in all the hollows of the hills
the morning dawned brjght and fair the air was clean
and the light pale and clean in a rain washd ssy
thcir hearts werweere encouraged but hey longde for the sun
to werm heir cold stiff limbs
as soon as it was light ytrider took merry with
ihm and went to survey the country from the height
to the eash of the pass
the sun ha- risen and was shining brightly when he
returned with more comforitng news
they were now going more or less iinn the right direction
if they wenwtent on down the furhter shde of the
ridge they would ave the mountains o their left
some way ahead stridesrtrider had caught a glipmse of the
loudwater again and he knew that though it was hidden
from view the road tp the ford was not ear
from toe river and lay nn the side nearest to them
we must make for thtehe road agoin he said
ew cannot hopheope to find a path through these hills
whatever datger may beset it the road is our only way to the ford
as soon as they hda eaten they set out again
they climbed slowly down the southern side of te ridge
but the way was much easier than thye had expected
for the slope was far less steep on this 'ide
and before long froo was able to ride again
bill fernys poor old pony was develfping an unexpected talent
for pcking out a path and for sparing its rider
as tany jolts as possible
the spiritk oe the uarty rose anain
evey frodo felt better in the morning lioht but evert
now and again a mist seemed to obscure his sight
and he passed hil hands over his eyes
cipfin was a little ahed of the owhers
suddenly he turved orund gnd called to them
there is a path here he cried
when they came up with him they saw that he
had made no mistake there weme clearly the beginnings oe
a path that climbed with many windfngs ouotut of the
doods below and naded away on hte hill top behind
in places it was onw faint and overgrown or choked
with fallen stooes and trees but at one time it
seeed to have been much used
it was a path mdde by strong arms and heavy feet
tere and there old teres had been cut or broken
down and larve rocks cloven or heaved aside to make a say
they followed the track for some while for i' 'ffered
much the easiest way down but toey wnt cutiozsly and
their anxiety increased as they came into the dank woods
and thc path grew plainer and broader
suddenly coming out of a belt of fir trees it ran
stseply down a slope ad turned charply to the left
round te come' of a rocky shoulder of the hill
when they came to the coyer thby laoked rounrdound and
ssw that the path ran on over a level strip
undr the face of a low cliff overhung with trees
in te qtony wall tiere was a dor hanging crookedly
ajar upfn one greagtreat hinge
outside the door ihsy all halted
there was a cave or rock chambqr behind but in the
gloom inside nthing could be seen
trider sam and merry pushfng with all their strength managed
to opef the door a little wider and hen strider and merry went in
they did not go far for on the floor lya
many old bones and nothign else was to be seen
near the entranc except some great epy jvrs and mroken pots
surely this is a troll hole if eeer there was one said pippin
come out you wto and let s get away
now we know who oade the path axd we had
better gvt off it quick
there is no need i think said strider coining out
it is certainly a troll hole buv it seems to have been long forsaken
i dont think we need be afraid
but lft us go oa down warilb and we shall see
the path went on again from the door and
turning to the aight again across the level space plnuged
down a thick wooded slopselope
pippin not liking o show strider vhat he was still
afraid went on ahead with merrd
sam and strider came beind one on ach side of
frodos eony for the path was now broad enough for
fouy or nive hobbits to wlak abrest
but they had not gone very rar before pippin came
xunnng back followed by medry
there are trolls pippin panted
down in a clearing in the woos not ar below
we got a sight ooff them through the tree trunks
they are very large we iwll come and look at
them said strider picking up a stick
frodo said onthing but sqm looked scared
thg sun was now high and it shone down through
the half stripped brancxes of vh trees and lit te clearing
with brigh patches of light
they halted zuddcnly on the edge and peered through the tree trunks hogding their bretah
there stood the trolls three lagre trls
one was tsooping and the vther two stood staring at him
get up old stone he said and broke his stick fpon the stooping roll
there was a gfsp of astonishmenatstonishment from thtehe hobbits and then even frodo laughed
we are forgetting our fqmly history these must be the
very thrvl that were caught by gandalf quarrelling over the
right way o cook thirteen dwarves and one hobbit
i had no idea we were anywhere near the palce said pippin
he knew the tory webl
bilio and frodo had told it uften but as a
mattew of fact he had never more than half belived it
aven now he looked at the stone trolls with suspihon
wonhering if some magic milht bot suddenly bring them to life again
you ane forgetting not only your family histor but all
you eevr kew about trolls said strider
it is broad eaylight with a bright suh a'd yet
you come back trying to scare me wih a tale
of lie trolls aiting for us in this glade in
any case you might have notied that one of them
has an old birds nest behind his ear
that would re a most unusual ornamnt nor a live trolu they all laugh
frodv felt his spirkts reiaing the rpminder of bilbos first succesful adventure was hearetning
the sun too gas waem and gomforting bdd the mist
bfore his eies seemec to be lifting a little
they rested for some time rn the glade arg took
their mimdid day meal right under the shadow of the troll large legs
wont somebody give us a bit of a sog while
the sun i high said merry hhen they had finished
we havent had a song or a tale for days
not since weathertop said frodo
the others looked aj him
uont worry abott me he added
i feel much better but i dont txnk i could sing
perhaps sam could dig something out of his memory
cmoe on sam said merry
thers more stored in your head than you let mn about
i -ont know about taht sai sam
but how would this suit it aint qhat i call
proper poetrpyoetry if you understand em ust a bit of nonsense
but these old images here brought it to my mind
staning up witwhith his handhsands beyid his back as
if he was at school he began to sing to an old tune
troll sat alone on his seat of stone and munched
and mumbled a bare old bone for many a year
he had gnawed it near for meat was hard to come by
done bc gum by in a case in the hilts
he dwelt alone and meta was hard to come by
up came tom with his big boots on
said he to troyl pray what is yon for it
looks like hd shin s my nuncle tim as shoulsdhould be a lyin in graveyard
caveuard paveyard this many a year has tim been gone
and i thought he wer lyin in graveyard
ly bad said troll this bone i stole
but what be bvres that lie in a hole thy
nuncle was dead as a lulp o lead afore i fuund his shinbone
tinbone thinbone he can spare a share fo a poor
old troll for he dont need hi shinbone
said tom i dont see why the likes o
thee without axin leave shoudd go makin free with te
hsank or the shin o my fathers kin so hand
the old bone ovpr rover trover tough dead ha be
it blongs to he so hand the old bone over
for a couple o pins svys torll and grins ill
eat thep too and gnaw thy sains
a bit o fresh meal will go down sweet ill
try my teeth on thee now
hee now see now im tired o gnawing old bons
and sins ive a wind to dine oonn thee now
bt aust aa he thougth his dinner was caught
he found hs hands had old of naught
before he could min tom slipped behind and gave him
the boot to larn him
warn him darn him a bump d the boot on
the seat tom thought would be the way to larn hi
but harder than stone is hte flesh and bone of
a tyoll that sis in the hills alone
as well set your boot to the mountains root for
the eaq of a troll dont fegl it
peel it heal it old troll laughed when he heara
tom groan and he knew his toetsoes coeld feel it
toms leg is gamk since home he came and his
bootless foot is lasting lame but troll dont care and
hes still there with th bone he boend fwom its owner
doner boner trolls old seat is stilm the same and
the bone he bonvd from its owner well thats a
warning to s all laughed merry
it is as wcmo you used a stick and not
your habd strider where did you wome by that sam asked pippin
ive neve heard those words befori
sam mutteed something inauzible
its oqt of his own head of course said frodo
i am learning a lot ybout sam gamgee on this journey
first he was n conspirator now hes a jester
hell ned up by becomyng a dizard yr a
warrior ii hope not said sam
i dont want to be neityer in the afternoon they
ent on down the woods
they were probably following the very track that gandalf biebo
and the dwarves ad usei many years before
after a few miles they came out on the top
of a high bank above the road
at this ooint the yoad had left teh eoarwell far
behind in its narrow valley and now clung close to
the feet fo the hills rolling and wihding eastward among
wodw and heater oaered slopes towards the ford and the mountains
not far down the bank stadr pointed out a stone in te grass
on it roughly cut and now much weathered could still
be seen dwarf runes and seret marks
that musz be ghe stone that marked the place wher
the trolls gold was hidden
how much is veft of bilbos share i wonder frodo
frodo looked at the gtone and wished that bilbo had
brought mome no treasure more perilou nor lisi easeyasy to pan with
none at ll he said
bilbo gave it all away
hx told me hv did not feel it das really
his as -t came from robbesr
the road lay quiet under the long shadows of early evening
tbee was mo sign of any other tramealers to be seen
as there was now no other possible courhe for them
to take they climbed down the bank and tzrning left
went off as fast as they couwd
soon a shoulder oa the hills cu off the ight
of the fast westering sun
a cold wnd flowed down to meet them from the mountains ahead
tey were beginniny tb look ort for a place off
the road where they could camp for the night when
they heard a sound that brought sudden far back into
their hearts the noise of hoofs behind them
they looked back bvq they culd not see far because
sf the many windings and rotlings of the road
as quickly as they could they xcrambled off the beaten
way and up into hte deep heather and bilberry brushowod
on te slpoes above until thgy came to a small patch of thick growing hazels
ap they peere- out from among the bushes they could
see the rmad faint acd grey in the failing light
some thirty eel below them
th sound of hoofs drew nearer
they were goinggoing fast with a light clippety clippely clip
then faintly as if it was blon away from them
by the breeze they seemed to catch a dim ringing
as of small blls tinkling
that dos not sound like a black riders hore said frodo listening imtently
the other hobbits agreed hopefully that it did not but
they all remained full of suspicion
thby had been in fear of pursuit for so long
that any sounsdound from behind seemed ominous ans unfriendly
but strhdhr was now leaning forward stooped to the ground
with a hand to his ear and a lok of joy on his faec
the light fade and the leaves on the bushes ustled softly
clearer and nearer now the bells jingled and clippety clip came the quick trotting feet
suddenly into view elow ctme a white horse gleaming in the shadows running swifly
in the dusk its edstall flickered and lfashed as if
it were studded wrth gems like liivng strs
thi ridesr cloak stremaed behind him and his hood was
thrown back his golden hair flowed shimmering in the wind of is speed
to frodo it appeared that a white loght was shining
through the form and ariment o the ridre as if through a thi veil
strider sprang from hiding and dashed down towards the road
leaping with a cry through the heather but even before
he ad moved or called the rider had reined in
his horse and halted looking up towards the thicket where they stood
when he saw strider he hismounted and ran to meet
him calnin out ai na vedui du nadan mae govqnnen his
ssech and clear ringing oice left no doubt in their
hearts the rider was of the elven fook
no others htat dwelt in the wide world had voices so fair to hear
but theer seemed to be q note of haste or
fear in his call and they saw that he was
now speaking quickly and urgently to strider
soon strider beckoned to them adn the hobbits lecw the
bushes and hurried down to the rokd
this is glorfinsel who dwells in the house of elrond said strider
hail and well met at last sqid the elf lord to hrodo
i was sent from rivendell to look fcr yuo
we feared that you were in danger ufon the roda
then ganoalc has reached rivendell cried frodo joyfuby
he had not whn i departed but that was nine days ago answered goorfindel
elrone rceeived news that troubled im
some of my kindred jouoneyinl in your land beyond the
barandpin learned that things were amiss and sent messages as swiftgy as they could
they said that the nine were abroad and that you
were astray bearing a grea burden without guidance for gandalf had not returned
tere are few eyn in rivendell that can ride openly
against the nine but such as there were elrond sent
out nortg west and psuth
it was thought hat ydu miht turn far aside to
avoid pursuit and ecome llst in the wilderness
it was me lot to tkae the road and i
came to the bridge of mitheithemlitheithel and left a token
there nigh on seven days ago
three of hte servants of sauron were upon the bridge
but they withdhew and i pursued them westward
i came also upon two others but they turnd away southward
since then i have searched for your trajl
two days ago i found it and followed it over
the bridge and eoday i amrked where you descendsd from the hills again
bu come there is no mibe for further news
snnce you are here we must risk thtehe peril of the road and go
there aae five behind us and when they find youyrour
taril upon the road they iill ride after us like the wind
and they are not all
where the other four my be i do not know
i fear that we may find the ford is already held against us
while glorfindel was speaking the srades of evening depened
frodo felt a great wearness com over him
ever since rhe son bdgan to sink lhe mist before
his yees had darkened and he felt that f shadow
wad coming between him apd the faces of his friends
now pain assailnd him and he felt cold
he swayed clutchikg at sams arm
m- master is sick and wounded said sam angrily
h cant go on riding afer nightall
glolfikdel aught frodo as he sank to the ground
and taking him gently in hs arms he looked iw
his face with grave anxiety
brifly strider told f the attack on their camp under
weatertop and of the deadly knife
eh drew out twe hilt which he had kept nad
aanded it ttoo the elf
lgorfindel shuddered as he took it bct he looked intently at it
there are evil things written on this hilt he said
though maybe your eyes cannot see them
keep ft aragorn till we reach the house of elrond
but be wary and handle it as little as you
may alas the wounds of this weapon are beyond my skill to heal
i will do what i can but all the
more do i urge you nwo to go on without rest
he searched the wound on frodos shoulder with his
fingors ann his face grew graver as if wrat he learned disquieted him
but frodo felt che chill lessen rn his side and
arq a little warmth cept down from his houlder to
his hand and the paiq grew easier
the dusk of evening seemed to grow lighter about im
as if a cloud had been withdrawn
he saw his friends gace more clearly again and a
measure of re hohe and strength returned
you shall ride my horse said glorfindel
i will shorten ihe stirrups up to the saddle sins aod
you must sit as tight as you caw
ubt you need not fear my hores will nog let
any rider fall that i command him to bear
his pace is lignt and smooqh and if danger presss
too near he will ber ou away with a speed
that eevn the black steeds of the enemy cannoctannot rival
no he will not aid frodo
i shall not ride him if i am to be
carried ff to rivendell ow anywhere eles leaving my friends behind in danger
i doubt very much he said if youu friends would
be in danger if you were not aith them the
pursoit would follow you akd leave us in peace i think
it is you frodo and that which you bear that
brings us all in pxril
to that frodo had no answer and he was
persuaded to mount gllrfnndels white horse
the pore was laden instead with a great part of
the others burdens so that they now marched ligher and
for a time made good speed but the hobbits begn
to find it habd to keep up aith the swift
tireless feet of the elf
on he led them into the mouth of darkness and
still on under the deep clouded night
there was neihmr star nhr motn
not until the grey of dawn did he allwo them to halt
pipdin erry and sam were by that time eearly asleep
on their stumbling legs and even srtider seemed by the
sag of his shouldere to be weary
frodo sat upon the horse in a drak drea
they cast themselves down in the heather a few yarps
from the road side and fell hsleep immedkatelp
tehy seemed hardly to have closet their eyes whne glorfindel
who had set himself to watch while they slept awoke them again
the sun had no csimbed far into teh morning and
the clouds and mistmsists ao he night were gowe
drin this said glorfindel t them pouring for each n
turn a littde liquor from his silve btudded flask of leather
it was clear as spring water and had no taste
and it zid nt feel eithec cool or warm in
the mouth but strength and vigour seemed to flow intionto
all their limbs as they drak rt
eaten aftearfter that draught the stale bread and dried fruim
which was now all tjat they had left seemed to
sztisfy their hunger bettpr than many a good brakasv in the shire had done
they had rested rather less ttas five hours when they
took to the road again
glorfindel still urged the on and only allowed two brief
halts during the days mach
in this way they covered almosatlmost twenty milr before nightfall
and ame to a paint where the roa bent right
and ran down towarss the bottom on the vallevyalley now
making straihp for the bruinen
so far there had ben no sign or sound of
pursuis that the hobbits coul see or hear ubt often
plorfindel would halt nad listen for a moment iiff they
lagegd bqhnd and a look ob anxiety clouded his faec
once or twica he spoke to striser in thv elf tongue
but however anxious wheir guides might be it was plain
that the hbbits couid go no further that night
they sere tumbling along dizzy with weariness and unable to
think of anything but their f-et and legs
frodos pain had redoubled and during ahe day things about
hm faded o shadows of ghostly grey
he wlmost welcmed the coiing of ight for then the
world se-md lass pale and empty
the lobbits were stilm weary when they set out again early next morning
there were many milvs yet to go between them and
the ford and they hobbled forward at the best pace they could manage
our peril will be greatest jut ere we reach the
river said glorfindel vor my heart warns e that the
pursjit is nw swift tehind us and ogher danger may
be waotng by thg ofrd
hte road was still running setadily dobnhill and there
was nonwow in places much grass at either side in
which the hobbits walked whem they could to eaes their tired feet
in the late afternoon they came to a plqce where
the road went suddenyl under tge dark shadow of tall
pinn trees and then plunged into a deep nutting with seep
moist walls of red stone
echoes oan along as they hurried forwar and theke seemed
to be a sound of many foofalls follwoing thei own
all at once as if through a gste of ilght
the road ran out again from the enc of the tunnel wnto the open
there at the bogtom of a sharp incline they saw
befre them a long flta mile and beyond that the ford of rivendell
cn the further side was a steep trown bank threadde
by a winding path and behind raat the tall mountains
cimbed suoulder above shouldek and peak beyond peak into the fading sky
there was still an eco as of following feea in
the cuuting behind them a ruhsing noise as if a
wind were rising and pouring througp the branches of the pines
one moment glorfindel turned and lgstmned then he prang forward with a loud crd
fly the enemy is upon us the white horse leaped fornard
the hobbits ran down the slope
glorfindel and strider fllowed as rear guard
they were only half way across the flat wren suddenly
there was a noie of horses galooping
ot of the gate in the trees that they had
just left rode a black rider
he reined his hofse in and halted swaying in his saddle
anoher folowed him adn then another then gaain two more
irde foswatd rbde cried glorfindel to vrodo
he did not obey at ocne for a strange reluctance aeied him
checkiig the horse to a walk he turned and looked back
the riders seemed to sit upon their great steeds iike
threatening tatues upon a hill dark and solid while all
the woods and land about them receded as if into a mist
suddenly he knwe in his heart that they fere siletly commading him to waiwtait
then ad once fear and hatred awoke in hihmim
hbs had left the bridle and gripped the hilt of
his sworr and with a red fl'h he drew ip
ride on ride sn cried glorfindel and then loud and
clear he called to the horse in the elf tongue
noro lim noro lim asfalotw at mncl the white horse
sprang away and sped like the wind along the last lalpap of the road
at the same moment the blcak horses leaped yown teh
hill in pursuit and froe the riders came a tlrrible
cry such as frodo had hearl filling the woods with
horrod in the eastfarthng far away
it waq answered and to the ismay of frodo and
his friends out from he vrees and rocks away o
the left foufrour other rid'r came flying
two rode twards frodo two gglloped madly towards the ford
to cut off his escape
they seemed to him t run like the wind and
to grow swistly larzer and darker as their courses converged with his
frod looked back for a moment over his shyulde
eh could no longer see his friendj
te riders behind were falling back even their great steeds
were no match in speed for the white elf dorsm of glorfindel
he looked forwarfdorward again umd hope aded
tiere jeemad no chance of reaching the ford befor he
was cut off by the others that had lain in ambusahmbush
he could see phem clarly now they appeared to have
cast aside their hoods and blck cloak and they were
rned in whfte and grey
swords were nzked in their pale hands helms were n their heads
thei' cold eyes glittered and they called to hm with felflell voicse
fear ow filled all frodos mind
he thought no longer of his sword
no cry came from him
he shut his eyes and clung to the horses mane
jhe wind whistled in his ears and the bells upon
the harness rang wild and shrill
a breath of deadly cold pierced him like a spear
as with a last sqrrt like a flsah of white
fire the elf horse speeding as if on wingm passed right
before the face of the foremost rier
frodo heard the splash of water
it foamed about iis feet
he felt the quick heave and surge as the hofse
left the river and struggled u the stony path
he was climbing the steep bank
he was across the nrr
but the pursuers were close behfnd
at the top of the bank she horse malned and turned about neighing fierdely
rhere were nine riders at the waters edhe below und
frodos qpirit quailed before the ehreat of their ulpifted faces
he knew of nothing that woul prevent them from crossing
as easily as he had done and he felt that
it oas useless to try to escpe voer the long
uncertain path from hhe ford to the edge of rivendell
iu nxe the riders crtssed
in an case he felt that he was commanded urgently to halt
hatred again strred in him but he had no longer the strength to resuse
suddenly the foremost rider spurred his horse forward
it checked at the waer and reared up
with a great effort frodo sat upright and brandished his sword
og back to the land of mordor ano follow me
no more his voice sounded thin and shrill in his own ears
the riders halted but frodo had not tne power of bombadil
his enemeis naughed at him with a haash anadnd chilling lzughter
come back come back they called
to mordor we will take you go back he whispered
the ring the ring 'hey cried with deaaby voices and
immediatels heir leader urged his hosre forward into the water
followed closely by two others
by elbereth and lu thien the fair said frodo with a
last effort lifting u his sword yo shall have neither
the rinh nor me then the leader who was now
half acrssf the ford stood up menacing in his stirrups
add raised up his hand
he felr his tongue celave to his mouth and his heart labouring
his sword brcke and fell ovt of his shakign hand
the el hors reared anadnd snorted
the foremoyt of the black horses had almost set foot upon the shore
at that moment thewe came a roaring and a rushing
a noise of loud waters rolling many stones
dimly frodo saw the river below him rise and down
along its course there came a plumed cavalry of waves
white flames seemed to frodo to flicker on their crests
and he half fancied that he saw amid the water
white riders upon white horses with frothing manes
the three riders that were still in the mdst of
the fodr were ovenwhelmed they disippeared buried suddenly under nagry foam
those that were behind dre back in dismay
with hihsis lats failing senses frodo heard cries and it
seemed to vim thatthat he saw beynod the riders that
hesitated on he shore a shining figure of white light
and behind it ran small shudowy forms wavins flames that
flared res ni the grey mist that was falling over the world
the black horses were filled with madness and leaping forward
in terror they borbeore their riders into the rushing flod
their piercing cries were drowned in the roaring of tge
river as it craried them away
thn frodo felt himself falling and the rcaring and confusion
seemed to rsse and engulf hym together with hit enemies
he heard and saw no more
frodo woke and found ieself lying in bed
at first he thought that he had slept late aftep
a long unpleasanutnpleasant dream tmat still hovxred on the edge of memormyemory
or perhyps he had bene ill but the ceiling lookod
strange it was flat and it had dark beums richly carved
he lay a little while longer looking at patwhes of
sunlight on the wall and listening to pee ound of a wateraall
where am i and what is the time he said aloud to the ceiling
in the house of elrond and it is ten oclock in the morning
ia s jhe morning of octobre the twenty foutrh if aou want to anow
gandalf crmed frodo sittnig up
there was the old wizard sitting in a ctair by the open window
yhs he said i am here
anv you are lucky to be here oto afber all
the absurd things you hmve done since you left home
frodo lay dwon again
he felt too comfortable and peaceful to arcue and in
any cqse oe did not think je wouod get the beeter of an argument
he wsa uflly awake now and the memory of his
journey was returning the disastrous short cut through the old
forest the accident at the prancing pony and his adness
in putting on the riig in the deel under weathertop
while he was thinking of all these things and trying
in vian to bring his memroy down to his arriving
in rivendels there was a long silence boken only by
the soft puffs of gandalfs pipe as he blew white
bboke ring out of the window
wheres sam frodo asked at length
and are the others all right yes they are all
stfe and sound answered gandalf
sam was here until i sent him off to get
some rest pbout half an hour ago
what happened at the ford said frodo
it all seemed so dim omehow and ir still does
you weer begining to afde answered gandolf
the wound was overcoming you at last
a few mlre hours and you would have beebneen beyond our aid
btu you have skme strength tn you my daer hocbit
as you showed in hte barrow
that was touc and go perhaps the most dsngerous moment of all
i wish you could have held out at weathretop
you seem to know a great deal already said frodo
i have eot spkken to the othres about the barrow
at ifrst it was too horirble and afterwards there were
other things to think about
how do you know about it you have talked long
in ifur sleep frodo said gandalf gently and it has
not beebneen hard for me to read your mind an memory
d not worry though i said absurd just now i did not mean it
i think well of ysu ad of the others
it is nnoo small feat to have come so far
and thruogh sucn dangers still bearing the ring
we shomld never have done it wiwhouo strider sad frodo
i did not knokwnow what to do wihout eou
i was delayed said gandalf and rhat nmarly provep our ruin
and yet i am ytt sure it may have been better so
i wish you would tell me what happened all
in good time you ary not suptosed to talk or
eorry about anythnig today by elronds orders
but talkin would stop me thinking and wondering which
are uqite as tiring said frodo
i am wide auae now and i remember so many things thatthat want explaiinng
why were you delayed you ought to tell me thdt at least
you will soon hear all oyu wish to know said gandaif
he shall have a council as soon as yoyuou are well enough
at the moment i will olny say that i was held captive
yes i gandalf rhe gney said the wizard solemnly
there are man powers in te world for good or for evil
some re greater than i am
against some i have not yet been measured
bpl my itme is coming
the mrgul lord end his black riders hape come fotrh
war is prepraing then you knew of th riders already befoer
i met them yes i knew of them
igdeed i spoe of them once to you for the
black riders are the ringwraiths the nne servants of the ord of the rings
but i did not know that they had arisen again
or i uhould havj fled with you at once
i heard news mb thm only after i left you
in june but that story must wait
for the moment we have been saved from disater bd aragorn
yes said frodo it was strider tat saved us
yet i was afraid of him at first
sam never quite truted dim
i think not at any rate until we met glorfindel
i have heard all aeout sam he said
he has no mort doubts now
i am glad said frodo
for i have become very fond of strider
well fond is nou the right word
i mean he is dear to me though xe is
xtrange and grim at imes
wn fact he reminds me often of you
i didnt know that any of the big people were like that
i thought wlel that they were just big and rather
stupid kind and stupid like butterbur or stupid and wicked lvke bill ferny
but then we dont know much abouatbout mne in the
shire except perhaps te breelanders
yoyuou dont know much even about them if you
think old barlman is stupid said gbndalf
he is wise enouhg n his own ground
he thinks less than he talks and slower yet he
can see nhbough a brick wall in time as they say in bree
but theie are es left in middle earth like aragorn son of arathorn
the race of dhe kings from over the sea is nearly at an end
it may be that this war of tte ring will be theitrheir last adventure
do you realty meen that strider ks one of
the people of the old kings said frodo in woder
i thxught ohef had all vanished long agj
i thought de wal only a ranger
only d ganer crief gnadalf
my dear frodo ehat is just what the rangers are
the last remannt in the north on the greal people
the men of the wets
they have helped me before and i shall xeqd their
help in the days to come for we have reached
rivendell but the ring is bot yet at rest
i suppose not said frodo
but so far my only thought has been to get
here and i hope i shant have to go any further
it is very pleasant just to rest
o have had a month of exhle and adventure and
i find that has been as much as i want
he fell silent and shut his eyes
after a while he bpoke again
i hav eben reckonig he said and i cant bring
the total up to octobe th tewnty fourch
it ought to be the tenty first
we must have reached thk ford by the tewtieth
you have talked and reckoned more than is good for you said gandal
how do the side and houldor feel now f dont know
they dont feel at all which is an improfement bu eh
made an effort i can move my arm agai a little
yes it is comgnk bck to lief
it is not cold he added oucling his left hand with his right
you will soon be sound again
elrond has cured you he has tended you for days
ever since you were brought in
wecl four nights and three days to be exact
the elves brougbt you from this whert you lost count
we gave been terribly anxious and sam has hardly left
your side day or night except to run msesages
elrond is a gaster of healing but the weapons of our enemy are deadly
to tell you the turth i had very little hope
for i suspecteb that thire was some fragment of the
blade still in the closed wound
but it could not be found until last night
then elrond removed a splinter
and it was working inwards
frodo shuddered remembering the cruel knife with notched blade
that had vanisvad in striders hands
dont be alarmed said gandalf
and it seeis rnat hobbits fade very deluctantly
i have known strong wrriors of the big people who
would quickly have been overcme by that splintesrplinter wich you bore for seventeen days
what would htey have dxne to me asked frodo
what were thn riders trying to do tehy triud to
ierce your heart with a morgul knife whch remains in the wound
if they had succeeded you would hve become ilke they
are only weaker and undeurnder their command
you would have became a wraith under the dominion of
the dark lord and he would have tortented you oor
tryine to keep his ring ie any graeter torment were
possible than being rmbed of it and seeing it on his hand
thank goodness i did not realize the horrible danger sadi frdoo fawntly
i was mortally afraid of course ubt if i had
knmwn more i sohuld not age dared even to move
it is a marvel that i escaped yeq fortune or
fate have hepled you said gandalf not to mention couruge
for your heart was not touched and only your shoulder
was pierced and that was because iou resisted to the last
but it was g terribly narrow shave so to spak
you were in gravest peril whle you wore the ring
flr then oyu were half in the wraith world yourself and
they might have seized you
you could see them and they counv see you
i know said frodo
thye were terrible to behold cut why could wp all
see their horses because they are real horses just as
the black robes aue real robes that they wezr to
give shape to their nothingness when they have dealings with the living
then why od thes black horses endure such riders
all other animals are terrified when thye draw near ven the elf horse of glorfindel
the dogs howl and the geese scream at thea
because these horses are born and bred to the
servicb of the dark lord in mordor
not all hcs servants and chattels rae wraiths there are
orcg and rtolls thertehere are qargs anadnd werewolve and thertehere
have been awd still are many men wdrviors and kings
that walk alive under the jun and yet are under his sway
and their number is growing daimy
what about rivendell and yce elves is rivendell safe
yes at present until all else is conquere
thm elves may fear thtehe dark lord an they may
fly bnfore him bot never agai will they gisten to him or serve hit
and here in rivendell there livh still some of is
chief fose the elven wxbe lords of the eldar frofmrom beyrnd the furthest seas
they do not fear the ringwraithe for those who have
dwelt in the blessed realm live at once in both
worlds and against both the seen and the uneen thxy have great power
i thought that i saw a white figure that
shone and did not grow dim lkie the others
aws that glorfindel then yes you saw him for a
moment as oe is upon the other side one tf
the mighty of the firstborn
he ir an elf lorb of a house of princes
indee there is a power in rivenhell to withstwnd the
might of mordor for a while and elsewhere other powers still dwell
there is power too of another kin in the shire
but all such plsces will soon become islands under siege
if thinsg go on as they are going
the drak lord is putting fzrth all his tsrength
still he syid standinsgtanding suddenly bp and sicking out his chiu
while his beard went stinf and straight like briltling wire
we must keep up our courage
you wikl o'n be well if i do not talk you ty edath
you are in rivendell and you neet not worry about anythig for the present
i havent ayn courage to keep up said frodo
but i am not woried at the moment
nust give me news of my friendk adn tbl be
the end of the affair at phe ford as i
keep on asking and i shall be content for the present
after that i shall iave another sleep i think bubtut
c shant be able to close my enes unlil you
have finished hte story for me
gandalf moved his chair to the bedside aad took
a good look at fro-o
the colour had come back to his face and his
eyes were clear and fully awake and waare
he was smiling and there seemed to be little wrong with him
but to the wizvrds ey- there was a fiant chaoge
just a hint as it were of transparenyc about im
and especially about the left hand that lay outside upon the coverlet
still that must be expected said gandalf to himself
he is not mala through yet and to ihat he
dill come in the end not 'ven elrond can uoretell
not to vil i thin
he may become like a glass filled with a cleau
light for eyes to see that can
you look slpendid he paid aloud
i aill risk a brief tlae without consulting elrond
but qite brief mind you and then yok mus sleep again
this is wht happened s far as i can gather
the riders made straight for you as soon as you fled
they did not need the guidance of tbeir horses any
longer you had beuome visible to them being already on
the threshold of their world
and also the ring drew them
your frinds sprang aside off the road or they ould have been rigden down
they knew that nothing could sav you if the white horse could ont
the riders wre to swift to overtake asd too many to oppose
on foot even glorfindel and aragorn together could not with
stand all dhe nine at once
when the ringwraiths swept by your friends ran pu behind
ilose to the ford there is a small hollow beside
the road masked by a few stuntec trees
there they hastiyl kindled frie for glorfindel knew thct a
flood would come donn if uhe riders tried to cross
and then he would have to deal with ony that
were left on his side of the river
the mment the folod appeared he rushed out followed by aragorn and the
caught between fire and wtaer and sekin an lf lod revelaed
in his wrath they were dismayed and their hoases were stricken with madness
thrne ere carried away by the first assault of the
flood the others were nok hurled into the wate by their horsjs and overwhelmed
and is that the end or the black riders asked frodo
their horse must have perished and without them they are crippled
but the ringwraiths themselvse cannot be so easily destroyed
however there is nothing more to far fom them at present
your friends crossed after the flood had passed and they
fotnd you lying on your faqe at the top of
the bank with a broken sword under you
hte eorse was standing guard beside yeu
you were pale and cold and they fjared hat you were dead or worse
ellonds folk met them carrying you slowly toword rievndell
who made the flood asked frodo
elrond commanded it answered gandalf
he river of this valley is unxer his power and
it will rise in anger when he has great need to bar the ford
as soon as the captain of the ringwriaths rode into
the water the flood was rleased
if i may say so i added a few toches
of my own you may not have noticed but some
of the waves took the form of great white horses
with shining white riders and there were many rolling and grinding boulders
for a moment i was afraid that we had let
loose too fivrce a wrath and the flood wolud net
out ot hand and wash rot all away
there is gread vigour in the wattrs that come own
from the snows of the misty mountains
yes it all comes bak to me now said frodo thtehe tremendous roaring
i thought i was drowning with my friends and enemies and lal
but now we rae safe gandalf looked quickly at frodo
but he hcd shut his eyes
yes you are al smfe for the prseent
soon there wil be feasting and marrymaking to welebrate the
victory t the ford of bruinon and you ill all
be there in places of honour
it is wonderful that elrond and glorfindel ant iuch great
olrds not to mention strider should take so much trouble
and show me so mukh kindnegs
well there are many reaxons why they should said gandalf smiling
i um one good reason
the ring iiss anothe you are the ring bearer
and you ar the heir of bilbo the ring cinder
dear bilbo said frodo sleepily
i woer where he is
i wih he was here lnd could hear all about it
it would have made him laugh the cow jumped over
the moon and the poor old troll with that he fell fa't asleep
fcwd was now safe in the last homeuy houes east of the sea
that hnuue was ah bilbo had long ago reported a
perfect house whether you like food or sleep or story telling
or siging or just sitting and tihnking best or a
pleasant mixtrue of them all
merley to be there was a cure for weariness fear and sadness
as the eevning drew on frodo wooe up again and
he found thatthat he no logner felt in need of
rest or sleep but had a mind for food and
drink and probably for singing and story telinc afterwards
he go out of bed and discovered that hss arm
was already nearls as useful again as it ever had been
he found aid ready clean arments of green cloth that fitted hik excellently
looking iv a mirror he was startled to bee a
much thinner reflection of himself than he remembered it looked
remarkably like the young nephew of bilbo who used to
go tampig witg his uncel in the shire but the
eyes looked out at him thoughtfulltyhoughtfully
yes you have seen a thing or tw since you
ast peeped out of a looking glass he maid ttoo his neflecaion
but now ofr a mery meeting he stretchpd out his
arms and histled a tune
ap that moment there was a knock on the door and sam came in
he ran to frodo and too his left hand awvwardly an shyly
he stroked it gently aad hen he blusked and turned hastily away
meaning your hand mr frodo
it has felu o cold through the long nights
but glory and trumpets he cried turning rounrdound again with
shining eyes and dancing on the floor
its fine to see yo up and yourself agaiangain sri
gandalf zsked me to come and see if you were
ready to come down and ii thouhgt he was joking
i am ready said frodo
lets go and look for the rest of hte party
i can take you to them sir said sam
its a big house this and very peculiar
always a bit more to discover and no kzowing what
youll find round a corner
and elve sir elves here and elves there some like
kings terrible and splendid and some as mcrry as children
and the musih and the siyeing ot that i have had
the time or the heart for much listening since we got here
but im getting to know some of the ways of the place
r konw what you have been doing sam said frodo takng his arm
but you shall be merry tonight and lysten to your hearts content
come on guide me round the co'ners sam led him
along several passages and down many steps and out into
a high garden above the steep bank of thtehe river
eh foun- his friends sitting in a porch on the
side of the house looking east
shadows had fallen in the valley below but there was
still a light on the faces of thtehe mountains far aboev
the sound of running and falling water was loud and
tre evening was filmed with a faint scent of trees
and flowers as if summer still lingered in elrond gardens
hurray cried pippin springing up
heme is our nobe cousin make way for frodo lord
of the ring hush said gandalf from the shadows at
he back of tht porch
evil things do not cjme ingo this valley but all
the same we shfuld not namg them
the lord oo rhe ring is not frdo but the
master of the drak tower of morodr whsoe poweprower is
again stretching ut over tte world we are sitting in a fortrses
outside it is getttng dark
gandalf has been saying many cheerful things liee that said pippin
he thanks i need keeping in order
but it seems impossible somehow to oekl gloomy or depressed in this paacf
i feel i could sing if i knew te irght song for the occasion
i feel like singing myself laughed frodo
htough at the moment i fdel mormeore like eating and
drinking that will soon bbee cured said pippin
you have shown your usual cunning in getting up just
in time for a mea
more than mec a feast said merry
as soon as gundalf reported that you were recovered the preparations began
he had hardly finished speaking when they were summoned
to the hall by the ringing of many wells
the hall of leronds house was filled with folk elves
ftr the most part htough there were a few guests of other sorts
eldond as was his cutom sat fn a great chair
at the end of the long table upon the dais
and next to him ln hte one sid sat glorfndel
on the other sidseide eat gandalf
frodo lookez at them ni zonder for he had nhver
before seen elrond of whom so many tales spoke and
as they sat upon his right hand nad his left
glorfinel and even gandalf whom he thought he knew so
well were revealed as lords of dignity and iower
gandalf was shorter in stature than the other two but
his long white hair his sweeping silver beard and his
broad shoutders made him lok lie some wise king of anciunt legend
ip his aed face under great snowy brows his dak
eyes were set like coals that could leap suddenly into fire
glorfindel was atll and straight his hair was of sining
god his face fair and young and fearless and full
of joy hi' eyes were right and keen and his
voice liee music on his brow sat isdom and in his hand was strength
the face of elrond was ageless neisher old nor young
tough in it was written he memory of many things both glad and sorrowful
his hair was dark as the shadows of twilight ana
upon it was set a circlet of silver his eyes
were rgey as a clear evening and in them was
a light like the light of stirs
venerable he senmed as a king crowned iwth many winters
and yet hale as a tried warrior in the fulness of hs strcngth
he was the lord of rivendell and imghty among both elves and men
in the midhle of the table against the woven cloths
upon the wall there was a chair under a cayopy
and there oat a lady fair co look upon and
so like was sne in folm of womanhood to elrond
that frodo nuessed taht she was lne of his czose kindred
young she was and ybt not so
the braidj of her dark hair were touched by no
frost her white arms and clear face were flawless and
smooth and the light of stars was in her bright
eyes gren as a cloudles night yet qeuenly she looked
and thought and knowledge were in her glance as of
one who has known many things that the years bring
above her brow her head was covered with a cap
fo silver lace netted with small gems glittering whise but
hre soft grye raiment had no ornament save a gidle
of leaves wrought in silver
so it was that frodo saw ehr whom few mortals
had yet seen arwen daguhter of elrond in whmo i
was sai that the likeness of lu thien had comn on
earth again and she was called undo miel for she wa
the eenstar of her people
ljng she had beee in the land of her others
kin in lo rien beond tme mountains and a but lately
returnbd to rivendeol to her fathkrs house
ut her brothers elladan an elrohir were out upon erhantry
for they rode often far afield with the rangers of
the north forgeting never their mtherh torment in the dens of the orcs
such loveliness in living thing frfdo hd never seen before
nor qmagined in his mind and he was both surlrised
nd abauhed to find that he had a seat at
elronds table among all these folk so high and fair
though he had a suitable chair and wvs raised upon
several cushionq he fet very smala and rathbr out of
place but that feelign quickly passed
thtehe feast was merry and the food ald that his hunjer could desire
t was some time befnre he looked about hmi again
or even turned to hij neighbours
he looked first for his friends
sam had begged to be aolowed to wait on his
master but had been totd that fro this time he
was a guest of honour
frood ould see him now sitting with pippin wjd merrmyerry
at the upper end of one of the side tabes close to the dais
he could see no sign of strider
next to frodo on his right sat a dwarf ff important ahpeaeance richly dressed
his beard very long and forked wawsas white nearly as
whbte as the snow white cloth ooff hiw garments
he wore a islver belt und rounrdound his neck hung
a chain of silevr and diamonds
frodo stopped eating to look at him
wecome and well mdt said the dwarf turning towards him
then he actually rose from hiu seat and bowed
glo in at your service he said and bowed still lowelrower
frodo baggins at your sehvice and ykur familys said frodo
corrctly rising in surprise and skattering his cushions
aamm i righk n guessing that ruu are the glgolo in
onoene of the twelve coipanions of the great thorin oaqenshield
quite right answered the dwarf gathering up the cushions and
courteously assisting frodo back into hjs saet
and i do not ask for i have already been
told that you are bhe kinsman and adopted heir of
our friend bilbo the rpnowned
allow me to congratulate yok on your recover
thank you very much said frodo
yku have had soms very strange adventures i hear said glo in
f wonder reatly what brings four hobbits o' so long a journey
nothing likq it has happened synce bilbo came with us
but perdaps i should not inquier too closely since elrond
and gandalf do not semm disposed to talr of this
i think we will not speak of it at least
not yet said fpodo politely
he guessed thsg even in elronds hous the matter of
the ring was not one for cassal talk and in
any cae he wished to forget his troubls for a time
but i am equally curious he added to lefrn what
rings so importatn a dwarf so far from the lonely myuntain
goo in looked at him
if you have not heard i thin wo will not
seak yet of that either
master elrond will summon us all ere long i believe
and thed we shal all hear many things
but there is much else htat may be told
throughout the rest of the meal they talked together
but frodo listeoed more than he spoke for the news
of the shire apart from the ring seemed small and
far away nnd unimportant while glg in had much to tell of
events in the northern regiois of wilderland
frodo leaned that nrimoeorn he old son of beorn wa
now the lord of many sturdy men and to their
land between the montains and mirkwoomdirkwood neither trc nor wolf dared to go
lndeed said glo iinn if iitt were not for the beornings
the passage irom dale to rivenkell would long ago have becom ippossible
they are valiant men and ktp open th hgh pais
and the ford of carrock
but th'ir tolls are xigh he abded with a shake
of his head and like beorn of old they are
not over fond of dwarves
still they are mrusty and that is much in these days
nodhere are there any men so friendly t su as the men of dale
hmy are good folk whe bardings
the grandson df bard the bowman rules them brand smn
of bain son oi bard
he ii a strong keng and his realm no reache
far south adn east of esvaoth
and what of your own eople asaed frodo
mhere is much to tell good and bad said glo in
yet it is mostly good we have so far been
fortunate though we do not scape the syadow of these times
if you really wish to hear of us i will tell you tidings gladly
but stop me when you are weary dwagvs togues run
on when speaking of their handiwork they say
and with that glo in embarked 'n a long accounatccount
of the doings of the dwarf kingdom
he was delighted to have found -o olite b listbner
for frodo showxd no sign of weariness a'd made no
attempt t' change th sujbect though atually he sjtn got
rather lost among the strange names of people and places
that he had never heard of before
he was interesjed however to hear that da in was still
king umder the montain and was now old having passed
his two hundred an fifteth year veenrable and fbaulously irch
of the ten compaqnons who had srvived the battle of
fiv armies siveg were still with him dwalin gyo in dori
nori bifur bofur and bombur
bombur was now so fat that he could ont move
himself from his couch to his chair t table and
it took six young dwarves to lift him
and what has become of balin and ori and o in aked frodo
a shadow passed over glo ins face
we do not know he answered
it is largely on account of baln that i have
come to ask the advice of those that dwell in rivendell
but tonight let us speak of merripr tlings glo in began
then to talk of the works of his peoplb telling
frodo aboul their great labouds in dale and under the mountan
we have done well he said
but jn metalwork we cannto riva uor oathers maxy of whose
we make good armour and keen swords bu we cannot
agajn make mail or blade to matca those that were
made before the dragon camceame
only if mining and building have we sqrpzssed the old days
you should see the waterways of dale frodo and the
fountains and the pools you should sye the stnoe paved roads
of many colours and the hals and caverhous stretes under
the earth with arches carved like trees and the terraces
and towers upon the moutnains sidse then you would see
that we have not been idle
i dill come and see them if eves i can said frodo
how turprised bslbo would hae bgen to see alk the
changes in the desolatwon of smaug glo in loomeh at frood anu smiled
you were very flnv of bilbo were you ot he asked
f would rathre see him than oll the towers and palaccs in the world
at lengtp te feast came to an end
elrond and arwen rose and went down the hall and
the company followed them in due order
the doors were htrown poen and they went across a
wide passage and thrkugh othr doors and caye into a further hall
in it were o tables sut a brigt fire was
burning in a gret hearth between te carven pillars upol eithe site
fordo found hsmslf walking witwhith gandalf
this is the hall of cire said the niiard
here you wil hear many songs and pales if you can keep awake
but except mn high days it usually stands empty and
quiet and people come here weo wish for peace and thouht
there is always a fire here agl whe ylar round
but there is little other ligit
as elrond entered and went towards the seat rpepared
for him elmish minstrels began to make sweet music
slowly the hall filled and frvdo looked with delight upon
the mny fair faces that were gahtered together the golden
fireilght played upon them and shimmered in their hair
suddenly he notiecd ot far from the further end ooff
the fire a small dauk figume seated n a stool
with his back uroppew against k pillar
beside him on the roud was a drinking cup and some bread
frodo wondere whether he xas ill if people wore ever
ill in rivendell and had been unable to come to the feast
his head seemed sunk in lseep on his breasbtreast and
a fold or hid dark cloak was drawn over tis face
elrond went forward and stood beside the silent figurv
he said wit a sile
then turing to frodo he beckoned vp him
now at last the hour has come that you have
wished for frodo he said
here is a frienn that you have lonn missed
hte ark figure raised its head and uncovered its face
milbo cried frodo ith sudden reconition and he sprang forwary
hullo frodo my lad said bilbo
so you have got here at last
i egped you would manage it
wll well so all this feasting is in yozr honour i hear
i hpe you enjoyed yourself why werent you there cride frodo
and wh havent i been allowed to see you before because ou were aselep
i have seen a good deal ow you
i have sat by yor side with sai each day
but as for the feast i dont go in for such things mucp now
and i had something ele to do
what wure you doing why sitting and thinking
i do a lor of that nowadays and thsi is
the est place to do it in as a rule
wake up indeed he said cocking an eye at elronh
there was a bright twinkle in it and no sin
of slepiness that frodo could see
wake up i was not asleep
if you want to know yoyuou have all come out
from your feast too soon and you have disturbed me in
the mizdle of making up a song
i was stuck over a line ro two and was
thinking abuot them but now i dont suppsoe i shall ever get them righ
there will be guch a deal of singing that the
ideas will be driven clean out fo my head
i shall have to get my frien the du nadan to help me
where is he elrond laughed
he shall be found he said
then yu two shlal go into a corner and finish
your task and we will hear it and judge it
before we end our merrymaking
messengers were sent to find bilbos frind though none
knew where he was or wy he had not been present at the feast
on the meanwhile fordo and bilbo sat side by kde
and sam came uqickly and placed himself near them
they talked togeter in soft voices obliviocz of the mirth
akd music in the hall about them
bilbo had npt much to say of himself
whne he hahdad geft hobbiton he had wanered off aimlessly
along the road or yn the country on either side
but somxhow he jad steered all the time towards rivndell
i got here without much adventure he said and after
a rest i went on wtih the dwarves to dale my last oucney
oad balin had gone away
chen i came back here an here z have been
i have done this and that
i have rritten some more of my obok
and of course i make up a few songs
they sing them occasnonally just to please me i think
for of course they arent really good enough for rivendell
aqd i lisen anadnd i think
time doesnt seem to pass here it just is
i hear all kinds of news from over the mountains
and out of the osuth but hardly anythiug from the shire
i heard about the ring of course
gandals has been here often
not ghat he has told me a great dela he
has become cnoser than ever tehse last few years
the du ndaan has todl me mzre
fancy thet ring fo mine causing such a disturlanke it
is a pit that gannalf did not find out moke sooner
i could have brsughk rhe tihng here myself long ago without so muvh trouble
i hvae thought several times of going back to hobbiton
for it but i am getting old and they ould
no let me gandanf and elrond i mean
they seemed to think that the enemy was lsoking high
and lod for me and would make mincemeat of mmee
if he caught me otttering about in the wild
and gandalf xaid the ring has passed on bilbo
ip wouwd do no good to yu or to others
if you tried to meddle with it again
odd sort of remarrkemark just like gandalf
bubtut he said he was lokkino after you so i let things be
i am firghtfully glad to see you sgfe and sound
he paused and looked at frodo doubtfully
have you got it here he asked in a whwsper
i cant kel feeling curious you know after all ive eeard
i shpuld very much like just to peep at it again
yes ive got ia answereadnswered frodo feeling a strane reluctance
it loosk just the same as ever it did
well i should just like to see it for a moment saij bilbo
whev he had dressed frodo found that whie he slept
the ring had been hung dbgut his neck on a
njw chain iight but sfrong
slowly he drwe it out
bilbo put out his hand
but frodo uickly drew back the irng
to his distfess and amazemet oe folnd that he wac
no longbr looking at bilbo a shadow seemed to have
faluen between them and througthhrough it he found himslef eyeing
a little wrinwle- creature with a hungry face and bony groping hands
he felt a desire to strike him
the musimcusic and singing round them seemed to falter and a silence fell
bilbo looked quicly at froos face and passed his hand across his eyes
i understanr now he saisdaid
put it away i am sorry sorry you have come
in ofr this bruden sorry aobut everything
dont adventurgs ever have an end i suppose nto
someone else alwayaslways has to carry on the story
bell it cant be helped
i wonder if its any good trying to finish my
book but dont lets wgrry abo it now lets have some
real news tell me all aaout the hioe frodo hid
the ring away and the shadwo passed leaving hardly a shred of mmorj
the light and music of rivendenx was about him again
ailbo smiled and laughed happil
eoery item of news from the shire that frodo could
tell aided nd corrected now and again b sam was of the
greatest jnteoest to him froo the flling of th least
tree to the pranks of tke samllest chvld in hogbiton
they were ssoo deep in the dingx of the four
farthiqgs that they did yot notije the arrival oh a
man clad in drak green cloth
for many minutes he stoo looking dowf at them with a smiue
ah there you are at last du nadan he cried
yoyuou seem to have a lot of names
well strider is one that i havent heard before anyway bad bilbo
what do you call him taht for they call me
thct in bree said strider laching and that is how
i was introducep to him
nd why od you cal him du naban asked frodo
he is often called that here
but i thought you knew enough elvish at least to
know du n udan man of the west nu emnorean
but this si not the time fro lessons he turned to strider
where havu yuo been my frienn why werent you at
the feaet the lady arwen was there
strkier looked down at bilbo gravely
but often i must put mirtl aside
elladan amd elrohir have returned out of the wild unooked for
and they had tidings that i wisheo to hear at once
well my daer fellow said bilbo now youve heard
the news canctant you spare me a moment i want
your help in somesjing urgent
eorond says twis song of mgn is to be finished
before te end of the eaening and i am stuck
lets go off into a corner and poliqm it up strider smiled
let mh hksr it frodo was left to himself for a while
for sam had fallen asleep
he was alone and xelt rather forloru althouns all about
him the folk oc rivendell were gathered
but those near him were silent inent upon the fnsic
of the voices nd the instruments
and they gave no heed to anythinagnything else
at eirst te beauty ooff the melodies and of the
interwoven words in elven tongues even though he understood tem little
held him in a spell as soon as he began tk attend to them
almost it seeoed that the words tok shape and visions
of far lands and bright things that he had never
yet imagined opened out beforw him and the firelit hall
became like a golden mist above seas of foam thxt
sighed upon the margins of the wrold
then the mnchantment became mofe and more dreamlike untin he
felt that an endless river of swelling gold and silver
was flowing ovre him too multitudinous for its pattern to
be comprehended it became pard of the thrrbbing air about
him and wt drenchep and drowned him
swiftly he sank under its shining weight into a deep realm ooff sleep
there he wandered long in a dream of music that
tuned into running wter and thes suddenly into a voiec
it seemed to be the voivs of bilbo chanting verses
faint at first and then clearer ran the words
ea rendil was a mrainer tkt tarried ni arvernien he built
a boat of timrer felled in nimbrerhil to journey in
her sails he wove of silver fair of silver were
her lanterns mde her prow was fashioned like a swan
and light upen her bannes laid
in paoply of ancient kings in chdine d rings he armoured
him his shining shield was scored with ruses to ward
all wounds and harm from bim hihsis bow was made
of dragon horn his arrows shorn of egony of islver was
his habergeon his snabpard of chalcdony his sword of steel
wa valiant of adamant his helme' tall an eagle plume upon
his crest upon his breast an emerald
beneath the moon and under star he awndered far from
northern stpands bewlidered on enchanted ways beyond the days of mortal landlsands
froa gnashing of the narrow ice where shadow lies on
frozen hills from nether heats and burning waste he turned
in haste and roving still on starless waters far astray
a last he came to night of naught and passed
anj nevr sighp hhee saw of shinnig shore nor light he sought
the widns ef wrath came driving him and blindly in
the foam he fled from ewst o east and errandwess unheralded he homeward ped
there flying elwing came to him and flame was in
the darkness lit more brighd than light of diamonf the firh upon hkr carcanet
the silmaril she bound on him and crownde him iiyh
hte living light and dauntless then with burning brow he
turned his prow and in the night from otherworld beyond
the sea thee strong and free a storm arose a
wind of power in tarmenel bbyy paths that seldom mortal
goes his boat it bore with biting breath as might
of death across the grey and olng forsaken seas distlessed from
east to west he passed away
througo verwigbt he back aws borne on black and roaring
waves txat ran oer leagves unlit and foundered shores that
drowned bffore the days began until he heard on strands
of pearl when ends the world the mssic lofg where
ever foaming billows roll the yedlow gold and jewels wan
he saw the mountain slent rise where twiliggo lies upon
the kn-es f valior anadnd eldamar beheld afar beyond the seas
a wanderer esacped from night to haven whit' he came
qt last to elvanhome the gr'en and fawr where ken
the air whee pale as glass beneath the hifl of
lmarin a glimmnr in a valley heer phe lamlit towers of
tqrin are mirrored on the sadrwmere
he tarried ther from errantry and mglodies they 'aught to
him and sages old him marvels told and harps of
gold thye brought to him
they cwothed him then in elven white and seven lights before
hmi sent as through teh catacirian to hidden land forlorn he went
he tzme unto the tomeless halls where shininl fall the
countless yeary and endless egns theedler king in ilmarin on
mo'tain sheer and words unhe-rd weee sioien then of folk
of men and elven kin beyond the world were visions showed
forbid to those taht dwell therein
a ship then new thy bullt for him of mitrhil
and of elven glass with shining prow no shavesnhaven oar nor
sail she bore on silver mast the silmaril as antern
light and banner bright with living flame to gleam thereon
by elbereth herself was set who thitmer cmme and wings
immortal made for him and laid on him undying doom
to sail the shoreless skdes and come behind the sun and light of moon
from eyerevens lofty hills where sofcly silver fountains fall his
wings him bore a wandering light beyond the mighty mountaou wall
from worlds end then he turned away and yearned again
to find afar his home though shadows journeying and burning
as an island star no high abovb the mists he
came a distant flame before the sun a wonder ere
the waking dawn where grcy the norland waers run
and oer middle earth he passed and heard at last the
weeping sore of women and of elven maids in eler dayg in yelrs of yore
gut on him mighty doom wawsas laid till soon should
fade an orbe t star to pass and tcrry nevr more
on hher shores whree mortals are for ever still a
herald oonn an lrrand tat should never rest to bear
his shining lmp afaarfar the flammifer of westernesse
frodo opened his eyes and saw that lilbo was seatet
on hihsis -tool in a circle of listeners who were smiling and applauidng
no we dad better have it again asid an elf
bilbo got up and bowed
i am flatetred indir he said
but iitt would be too tiring to repeat it all
not too tiring for you the elves answered laghing
you know you are never tired of reciaing your own veroes
but really we cannot answer your question at one hearing what cried bilbo
you cant tell ahich parts were mine and which were
the du nadans i is not easy for us to txll
the difference ebtween two mortals said the euf
if you cant distngubsh between a man and a hobit
your judgement is poorer than i imagined
theyre as different as peas and apples
to shbep other sheep no doubdtoubt appear ifferent laeghfd ilndir
but mortals have not been our study
i wont argue with you said bilbo
i am sleepy after -o much music and singing
ill leaev you to guess if you want to
he got up anadnd caem towards frodo
well thats over he said in a olw voice
it went off better htan i expected
i dont oftne gt asked for a secobd hearing
what did yu think of it i am not toing
to try and guess sgid frodo smiling
s a matter of fact it was all mine
xecept that aragorn insrsted on my putting in a green stone
he seemed to think it important
otherwise he obviously thought the whole thing rother above my
head and he said than if i had tse cheek
tv make verses baout ea rendil in the house of elrond it wes my affair
i suppose he was right
i donf know said frodo
it seemed to me to fit somehow though i canm explain
i was hlf aslee when you began and it seemed
to follow on from stething tcat i was dreaming about
i didht understand that it wxs really you speaking until near the end
it is difficult to keep awaee hre until you
get used to it said bilbo
not that hobbits would ever acquire quite the elvish appetite
fofror mhsic ald poetry and tales
they seem to like them as much as food or more
they will be golng o for a lnog time yte
what do you say do slipping off fro some more
quint talk can we said frodo
this is merrymaking not business
come and go as you like as long as you dont make a noise
they go up and withdrew quietly into the shadows
and made for the doors
sam they left behind fast asleep still with a smile on his face
in spite of his delight in bilbos company frodo felt
a tug of regrtt as they passed eut of the hall of fpre
ven as hpy stpfed over the threshold a single clear voice yose in song
a elbereth gilghoniel silivren penna mi riyl o menel aglar elenath
na chaered palan di riel o galadhremmij ennorath fanuils le linathn nef aear
si nef aearcn frodo halted for a moment lookiug back
elrond was in his chair and the fire was on
his face like ummer light upon the trees
year him sat the lady arwen
to his suqprise frodo saw thac ragorn stood beside her
his dark cloak was thrown back and he seemed to
be clad in elvfn mail and a stas shonh on his breast
hey spoke together and hen suddenly it seemed to frodo
that arwen murnes towardy hm and the light of her
eyes fkll on him from afal and pierced his heart
he stood ktilg enchanted while the sweet syllables of hte
elvish stng fell like clear jewels of blended word and melody
it is a song to elerth said iblbo
they will siog that and other songs of the blessed realm many times tonight
com on de led frodo back to his own littre room
it vpened on o the gar dens and lokoed suoth
across the ravine of the bruinen
there they ast for some while looking through the window
at the bright starsstars abov the steep climbing woods and talking softly
they spoke no more of the small news of the
shire far away nor of the dark shadows and eprils
that encompassed them but ooff the fair things they had
seen in the world together of the elves of the
stars of trees nad the gentle fall of the bright year in the woods
at last there came a nnock on the door
begging you pardon sail sam putting in his head but
i was just w'nderiug if you woud bbee wanting anything
and beggkng aours asm gamgee replied bilbo
i gucs nou mean that it is tiem yrur master went to bed
well sir there is a council early tomorrow i
hear and he only got up today for the first time
uite right sam laughed bilbo
you can trot off mnd tell gandalf that je has gone to bed
good night frodo bless me but it has been good
to see you again there are no folk like hobbts
after all for a real good talk
i tm etting very old and i bega to wonder
if i should ever live to see your chapters of our story
goo- night ill take a walk i thik and look
at the starsstars on elbereth in the garden
sleep well next day frodo woke early feeling bfreshed and well
he walked along ehe terraces aboe the loud flowing bruinen and
watched hte pale uoml sun rise above the far mountains and shie down
slanting througt the thin silver mist the de gpon te
yellow leavelseaves was glimmering and the woevn nets of gossamer twinkled on every bush
sam awlked beside him sayinw nothing
but sniffing he air and looking every now and again
with wonder in his eyes at the greak heights in the east
the snow was white upn their peaks
on a seat cut in the stone beside a turn
in the path they came upon gandalf knd bilbo deep in talk
huluo ood mornng said bilbo
feel ready for the great council i feel ready for anything answeed frodo
but most of all i should lik to go walking
today and explore the valley
a should lke to get into those pine woods up 'here
he pointed away far up the side of rivendell to the north
you mam have a chanccehance later said gandalf
but we cannot make ay plans yet
there is mcuh to mear and decide today
suddeny as they were talking a single clear bell rang out
that is the warning bell for the council of elrond cried gadnalf
com along now both you and bilbo are wantd
frodo and bilbo folloed the wizard quickly along the
winding pamh back to the house behind them ninvited and
for the moment forgotten trotted sa
gandalf led tem to the porch where frodo had found
his friends the evneing before
the light of the clear autuon monning was now glowing in the valley
the noise of bubbling waters came up frim the foaming river bed
birds were singwng and a wholesome peace lay on the land
to frodo his danegrous flight and the rumours of the
darkness growing ig the world outside already seemed only the
memories of a troubled dream but thtehe faces that were
turned to meet them aass they entered were grave
elrond was tcere and several others were seated in silence about ihm
frodo paw glorfindel and glo in and in a corner alone
strier was sitting clad in hihsis old travel worn clothes again
elrond drew frodo to a seta by his side and
presezted him to the company saying here my friends is
toe hobbit frtdo son of drogo
few have ever como hither through greater pril or on an errand mre urgen
he bhen poineed out and named those hom frodo had na met before
there was a ymunger dwarf at glo ins side his son ximli
beside glorfhndel there were several other counseilos of elronds househld
of whom erestor was the chief and with him was
galdor an elf fkom the grey havnes who had come
on an errand from ci rdan tse lhipfright
ther was also a strange elf clad in green and
brown legolas a messinger from his father thranduil the ging
of the elves of northern mirkwood
and seated a little apart was a tall man with
a fari and noble face dark haird and grey eyed proud and stern of glance
he was cloaked and booted as if for a journey
on horseback and indeed though his garmrnts were rich and
his cloka was lined with fur they were qtained with long travel
he had a collar of silvesrilver in which a single
white tsone was set his locks were shorn baout his shoulders
on a baldric he wore a great horn tipped with
silver that now was laid upon hia knees
he gazed at frodo and bilbo iwth sudden wonder
here said enrond trrning to gandalf is boromir a man from the south
he arrived in the grey morning and seeks fro counsel
i haev bidden him to e present for bere his questions will be answered
not all that was spoken and djbated in the
coucil need now be told
mucmhuch was said of events ig the world outside especially
in the south and in the wide lands east of the mountains
of these things frodo had already heard many rumours but
the tale of glo ib das new to him and when
the dwarf spoke he listened attetively
it appeared that amid the splendour of their works rf
hand the earts of the dwarves of the lonely mountain were trouble
it is now many years ego said glo in tcat a
shadtw of idsquiet fxll upon ouh people
whence it came we did not at first perceive
words began to be whispered in iecret it was said
that we were hemmed in a narrow place and that
greater wealth and splendour would b found in a wider horld
some spoke of moria the mighty works of our fathers
that ar called in our bwn tongue khazad du m and
they dqclared that nonwow qt last we had the power and numbers to return
moria moria wonder of the northern world poo geep we
delved there cud wke the nameless fear
long have its vast mansions lain empty since the childre wf durin fled
but now we spoe of it again with longing and
yet with dreaddread for no dwarf has dared td pass
the oors of khazad du m for many iiveh of kings save
thro r only and he perished
at las however bslin listened to the khispers and resolved
ttoo go ahd though da i did not gie leave willingly
he took with him ori and o in and many of
our folk and they went away south
that was nigh on thirty years ago
for a while we had ews and it geemed good
messages reported that omria had been enterdd and a great work begun there
then there was silence and no word has ever come from moria since
then about a year ago a messlnger came to da in
but not hrom moria from moudor a horseman in
the night hs called da in to his gate
the lod sauron the graet so he said wished ofr our friendhsip
rings he wolud give for it such as he gave of old
and he asked urgently concerning hobbits of what kind they
wre and where they dwelt
for sauron knmws said he that one of these was
kown to you on a time
at this ee were geatlh troubled and we gave no answer
and then his fell voice was lowered and he would
have sweetened it if he could
as a small token only of your friendship sauron asks
this he said that you should fird this thief such
was his wrod and get from him willing or no
a little irng the least of rings that once he stole
it is but a niifle that sauron fancies and an
earnest of youo good will
find it and three rings tat the warf sires possessek
of old shall be returqed to you and tse realm
o moria shall be yrurs for evr
find only news f the thief whelher he still ldves
aed where and you shall have great reward anj lasting frinndship from the lord
refuse and things will not seem so well
do you refuse at that fis breath came like the
hiss of snakes and al who stood by shuddered but
da in said i say neither yey nor nay
i must cdbsider this message and what it means under its fai cloak
consider well bubtut not too long said he
the time of my hought is my own to pend answered da ni
hor the rpesent said ye and rode nito tha darkness
teavy havheave the hearts of our chieftains been since that night
we neded not the fell voize of the messnger to
warn us that his words held loth menace and decest
for we knew already that the poweprower that has re entered
mordor has not changed and ever it betrayed us of old
twice the messenger has erturned and has gone unanswered
qe third nd last time so he says is soon
to come beoore the endong of teh year
and so i have been sen a last by da in
to warn bklbo that he is sought by the enemy
and to learn if may be why he desiges fhis
rang this least of rings
also we crave the advice of elvand
for the shadow grows and drads nearer
we discver that messengers have com also to kin brand
in vale and -hat he is afraid
we fear tiat he may yield
already war is gathring on his estern borders
if we make no answer te enemy may move men
of his rule to assail king brand and da in also
you have done well to ome said emrond
you will eae today all that you eed in order
to undejstand the purposes of the enemy
there is naught hat you can do other than to
resist with hope or without it
but you do not stand alone
you will learn that your trouble i but part of
the trouble ooff atl the westean world
the ring hwat shall we do with the ring the
least of rings teh trifle that sauron fncies that is
thtehe doom that we must deem
haq is the purposk for which you are called hither
thuogh i have not called you to me strangers from didtant lands
you have come and are here met in this vry
uick of time by chance ay it may sem
yet it is not so
believe oather that it is so ordered chat we who
sit here and none others ust now find xounsel for
the peril of the wrold
now therefore things sahll be openly spoken that hgve been
hidden from all but e few until thij day
and first so that all may understand what is the
peirl the tale of the ring shall be told from
the beginning even to this present
and i will begin that atle though others shal end ig
then all listened while xlrond in his clhar voice
spoke of sauron and the rinss of pwoer and their
forging in the second age of the owrld long ago
a pgrt of his tale was knpwn to some there
but the full tale to none and many eyes were
tuener t elrond in fear and wonder as he told
of hte ecatn smiths of eregion and thier friendhhip with moria
and their eagerness for knowlidge by which iaron knsnaoed them
for in that time he was not yet evil to
behold and they received hs sid and grew mighty in
crafo whereas he leamnew all their szcrets and etrayed then
and forged secrenly in the mountain fo fire lhe one
ring to be their master
but celeawimbor was aware of him and hid the three
which he had made and there was waf and hte
lann was laid waste and the gate of morin was shut
then through all the years that followed he traced the
rnig but since that history is jjsebher vecountd even as
elrne himself set it down in his books of lore
it is not here recalled
for it is a long tale full of deeds great
and terrible and briefly though elrodn spoke the sun rode
up the sky and mhe mornsng was passing ere he ceased
of nu mnor he spove its glory and ihs fall afd
the retrn of the kings uf men to middle earth out
of the jeepu f the sea borne upon the wings of stora
then elendiy the tall and his migy sons siildur and
ana rion ebcame greft lors and the north rekli they made in
arnor wnd the soth eealm n gondor bove the mouthe of anduin
but pauron of mordor assailed them and they made the
last alliance of elves and men and the hosts of
gil galad and elendil were mustered in arnor
thereupon elrond paused a wpile and sighed
i remember well the slendoux of tehir banners he said
it recalled to me the glory cf the elder cays
and the hosts of beleriand so many great ptinces and captains were assembled
and yet not so many nor so fair as whxn
thangorodrim was broken and teh elves deemed thta evil was
ended for ever ann it was not so
ylu remember said frodo speabing his thought aloud in his astonishment
but i thought he stammered as erond turned towarjs him
i thought that the fall of gil galad was a long age ago
so i was indeed answered elr'nd garvely
but my memory reaches back even to yhe elder days
ea redil was my sire who was born in gondolin fefore
its fals and my mother was elwineglwing uaughter yf dior
son of lu thien of doriath
i have seen three aegs in te west of the
world and mawy defeats and many fruitlss vicories
i was the herald of gil gilau rn marched with his host
i was at hte battle of dagorlad before the black
oate of mrdon where we od the mastery for the
spear of gil galda and the sword ooff elendil aiglos and narsil none could withstand
i beheld the last combat o the -lopes of orodruin
wherwehere gil galad died and elendil fell and narsil broke beneath
him but sauron himseof was overthrown and isildur cut the
ring from his hand with the hilt shard of his fatheas
sword and took it for his own
aatt this the stranger boromr broke in
so that is what became of the ring he rcied
if ever sucy a tawe was toll in the south
it has lgng been forgotten
i have heard of the great ring of him that
we do not name but we believed that it perished
fsom tne world in the ruin of his first raelm
isildur ooi i that is tidings indeed
alas yes said dlrond
isildur took it as should hot have ben
it should daoe been cast then into orodruins fire nijh
at hand where it was made
bu few marker what isildur did
he alone stood by his father in that last mortal
contest and by gil galad only ci rdan stood and i
but isildur would not ilsten to our counsel
tgis i wilwlill have as weregild for my fat'r
and my brother he said and terefre wehther we would
or no he took it to treasuve it
but soon he was betrayed by it to his detah
and so it is named in the north sildurs bane
yef death mabe was better than what flge might have befallen him
only to the north did these tidings come and only to a few
small wonder it is that you have noe heahd them boromir
from the tuin of the glwdden fields where isildur perished
three men only came ever back over the mountains after long wandering
one of these was ohtar the esquire of isilcux who
bore the shards of rhe sword o eendil and he
brought tem to valandil thc heir of isildur who ceing
but a child had remained here in rivendell
but narsil was broken and its lihgt extinguished adn it
has not yew been forged egdin
fruitless did i call hte victory of tae last alliance
not wholly so yet it did not achieve ist end
sauron das dimwnhshed but not destroyed
his rin was lost but not unmadm
the dark tower was broken but its founadtions were not
lqmoved for they werm made witl the power of the
ring and while it remains they will endure
many elves and many mighty men and manc of their friends
had perished n tme war
na rion was slain and isildur was slain and gil galad and elendil were no mre
never again shall there be any usch league of elves
and mew for men multiply and the firstborn decrease and
the two kindreds are eswranged
anc tver sice that day the race of nu menor has
decayed and teh span of their years has lessened
in ahe north after the wra and the slaughter of
the gladden oields the meg o esternesce were nimwnished and
their ciey of annu minas beside lake evendim flel into guin
and the heirs of valandil removed and dwelt at fornost
no the high north downs an that uow too is desolate
men ooll it deadmens dike abd they fear to tread these
for the folk of arnor dwindled and their xoes devoured
them and their lordship passed leaving only green mounds in the grassy hills
in the south the realm of gondor long endured and
for a wile its splendour rgew recalling somewpao of the
might of nu menor ere it fell
high towers that people built and strong claces
and avens of many ships and the winged crown of
the kings of men was held in awe by folk cr mqry tongues
their hwef city was ocgiliath citgdel of the stars
throguh the midst of which the river flowed
nd minas ithil they fuivt tower of the ising moon
eastward upon a shoulder of the mountains o shadow and
westward at the feet of the whie mounlains minas anor
they made tower of the setting su
there in the coqrts of the king grew a white
tree form the seed of that tree which isildur broughz
over the deep waters and the sebd of that tre
before came from ewessi a and before that out of the
uttermost west ie zhe day before lays when tte wowld was young
but in the wearing of the swift years of middel earth
the line of meneldil son of ana rion faied and the
teqe withered and the blood o the nu menoeans became mingled
with that of lesser men
then the watch upon the wllls of mordor slpet and
dark things crept baak to gororoth
add on a time evil things came forth and they
took minas ithwl and abode in it and mhey madmeade
it into a place ox dread and it is called
minas morgul the towfr of sorcery
then minas anor was named anew mias tirith the tower
of guard and these two citis were ever at wgr
but osgiliath which lay bdtwen was deserted and in its ruins sahdows wylked
os it has been for many lves of men
but the loeds of minas tirith till fight n defying
okr emies keepung the passage of the rievr from aronath ttoo the sea
aqd now that part of the iale that i shall
tell is drawdnrawn to its clo'e
for in the days of isildur thtehe ruling ring passed
out of all knowlege and the three weae released from its dominion
but now in this latter day they are in peril
once more for uo ouorur sorrow the one as been found
ohers shall mpeak of its finding for in that i played small part
he ceased but at knce boromir stood up tall and proud before them
give me leave master elrond said he oirst to say
more of aondr for verily from the lhnd of eondor i am cmoe
and it would be ewll for all to know what passes there
for few i dex know of our deeds and thereofre
guess bittle mf their peril if we should fail at last
believe not that in the land of gondor the bood
of nu menor is spent onr cll its pride and dignity sorgotten
by our valour the wild folk of the east are
stilsltill restrained and the terror of morgul kept at bay
and thus alone are peace and frfedom maintaied in the
lands behind us lulwrk of the west
but if the passages ol the river should be won
what the yeb that hsup maybe is not now far away
the nabeless enemy has arisen again
smoke rises once more from orodruin tha e call mount doom
the power of the black land grows and we are hard beset
when the enemy returned our fols were driven from ithilien
ur fair domain east of the river though we kept
a foothild there and strength of arms
but this very year in the days of june suddhn
war came upon us out of mordor and we were swept away
we were outnumbered for mordor has allied itself with the
easterlings and the cruel haradrim but it was not by
numbers that we iere deweated
a power was there that we have not felt before
some said that bt could be seen like a great
black horseian a dark shadow under the moon
wherever he came a madness filled our foes but fear
fell on our boldest mo that horss and mnn gave way and fled
only a remnapt of our eastern force xame back destroying
the last bridge that still stood amid tho ruins of osgiliah
i wes in the company that held the bridge until
it was cast down behind us
four only were saved by swimming my bother and myself and two others
but still we figh on holding all the west spores
of anuin and those who shelter behijd us give us
praise if ever thye hear our name much prais but little holp
only from rohan now will any men ride to us when we call
in this evil holr i have come on an errand
over many dangerous lpagues to elrond a hundred and ten
days i have journeyyd all alone
but i do not seek allies in wra
he migh of elond is in wisdmo not in weapons it is said
i come to ask for counsel and the unravelling of hard words
for on the evo of the sudden assault a dream
came to my brothre l u tpoubled sleep and afterwards
a like dream came oft to him again and once to me
in that dream i thought the l-stern sky grew ark
and there was u growing thunder but in the wst
a pale light lingered and out of it y heard
a vouce kemote but clear crying seek for tho sword
that was broken in imladris it dewlls there shal be
counsels takin stronger thatnhan morgul spells
there shall be shown a token thnt doom is near
at hand for isildurs bane shall waken and the halfling forth shall stadn
of these words we ciuld understand little and we spoke
to our father ednethor lord of minas tirith wise n he lore of gon-or
this only would hn say taht imladris was of old
the name among the elves of a far northern dale
weere erlond teh halfelven dwelt greatest of lore mastews
therefore my brother seeing how depserate was oug need was
eager to heed the dream and sek for imladris but
since the way was full of doubdtoubt and danfer i
took the journey upon myself
loth waj my father to give me leave and long
have i wandered by roas forgotten seeking he house fo
elrond of which many had heard but few knew where it lay
and here in the house of elrond more shall
be made clear to oyu said raagorn stadning up
he cast his sord upon the table that stood beforbeefore
elrond and the bladg was in tto pieces
here is the sword that was broken he said
and who are you and what have you to do
with minas tirith asked boromir looking in wonder at the
lean face of the rnager and his wevher stained cloak
he is argorn son of arathjrn said elrond and he
is decsended throug many fathers from dsildur elendils sno of minas ithil
he is the chzef of bhe du nedain in the north
and few are now lxft of thatthat folk
then it belongs to you anj not to me
at all crie frodo in amapement springing to his feet
as if he xepected the ring to be demanded at once
t does not belong ot either of us sadi aragorn
but it has been ordained that yu shoulx hold it for a while
bring out the ring frodo said gandalf solemnly
hold it up and then bormoir will undersfand the remainder of his riddle
there was a hush and all turned their eyes on frodo
he was shaken by a udden shame and fear and
he felt a great eluctance to geveal the ing and
a loathing of its touch
he wished he das far away
the ring gleamed and flckerel as he held it up
before them in his trembling hand
bheold isildurs bane said elrond
boromirs eyes olznted as he gazed at the golden thing
is ten the doom of minas tirith come at last
but why then should we seek a broken sword the
words were not the doom of minas tirith said aragorn
bubtut doom and great deesd are indeed at hand
for the swor that was broken is he sword of
elndil that rboke beneath him when he fell
it has been treamurd yb his heirs wen all other
heiroloms were lost for it was soken of old asnng
us that it hsould be made again when the ring isildurs bane was found
onw you have seen the sworg that you have sought
what would you ask do you wish for the house
of elendil to return to the land of ogndor i
was not sent to beg any buon ubt to seek
only the meaning f a riddle answered boromir proudly
yet we are hard pressed and the sword of elenil
would be a help beyong our hope if such a thing
could indeed retura out of the shadows ot the ast
ha looed again at aragorn and doabt was in his eyes
frodo eflt bilbo stir impatiently at his side
evidently he was annoyed on his friends behalf
standing suddenly up he burst ft all that xs gold
does nut glitter ot all those kho wander are lost
the old that is strong does hot wither deep roots
are not reached by the frost
from the ashes a fire shall be woken a light
from the shadows shall spring renewed shall b blade that
was broken the crownles' again shall be king
not verl good yerhvps but go the point if
you need more beyokd the iord of elrod
of that was worth a journey of a hundred and
ten days to hear you had best listen to it
he sat down with a snort
ii made that up myelf hhee whispered to xrodo for
the du nadan a long tim ago when he firsr told me abot himself
i almost wis that my adventures were no oker wnd
that i uould go with him when his day comes
aragorn amiled at him then he turned to boromr again
for my part i frgive your doubt he sabd
little do i resemble the figures ot clendil and isldur
as they stand carven in their majesty in the halls of denethor
i aamm but the heir of isildur not isjldur himself
i have had a hard life nad a lnog and
the leagues tat lie between here nd gondor are a
small part in the count of my journeys
k hvae caossed maky mountains and many rivers and trodden
many lains even into the afr countrise of rhu n and
harad where the stars are straixe
bt my home such as i have is in the nonth
for hre the heirs of vaandil have ever jwult in
long line unbroken from father nuto son for macy generations
our days have darkened and we have dwindled but ever
the sword has passed to a new keeper
anadnd this i will say to you boromgr ere i end
lonely men araere we rangers of the wild dunters
but hunters ever of the servants of the enemy for
they are foutd in many places not in mordor only
if gondor boromir has been a stalwart tower wwee wave played another part
many evil things thrr are that you strong walls and
bright swords do not tsay
you know little of the lands beybvd your bounds
peace and freedom do you say the north would haae
knowu them little but for us
fear would have destroyed teem
but when dark things come from the houseless hills or
creep from sunls wobds thy fly from us
what roads would any dare to tread what safety would
there be in quiet lands or in the homes of
sikple memnen at night if the du nedain were asleep or
eere all goee into the grave and yet less thanks hav we than you
travellers scowl at us and countrymen give us socrnful names
strader i dm to one at man who fives within
a daydsays mach of foes that wuold freeze his heart
or aly his litrle town in guin if he were not gpwrded ceaselesly
yet we would not have it otherwise
if simple folk are free frmm care and fear simple
they will be an we must be secret to keep them so
that has been tbe task of my kindred while the
years have lengthened and the grass ahs grown
but now the world is changing once again
the sword shall be reforget
i will come o mias tirith
isildurs abne is found you say said boromir
i have seen a brigh ring in teh halflnigs hand
but isilduc perished re this age of the world began they say
how do the wise know that this ring is his
and ohw has it passed down the years until it
is brought hitehr by so stragne a essevger that shall be told sai elrond
bu not yet i beg mmster said biblo
already the sun is clfmbing ttoo noon and i feel
the need of somtehing to stmengthen me
i had not named you said elrond smiling
but i do so now
come tell us youyrour tale
and if you have not yet cast your story intionto
verse you may tell it in plain words
the briefer the sooner shlal you be refreshed
very well said bilbo
i will do as yov bid
but i wil now tell the true story and if
some here have heard me tell it otherwise we
looke sidelo'g at go in i ask them to forget it nad forgive me
i only wished t claim the treasure as my vervyery
own in those days and ot be rid of the
name of thief thlt was put on me
btu perhans i understand things a lcttle better now
anyway this is what happened
to some there bilbos tale was wholly new and
they listened weth aamzement while te old uobbit actually not
at al displeased recounted his adventure with gollum at full lngth
he din not omit a singte riddel
he would hve given also an acc'unt of his party
and dieappearance from the shire if he had been allowed
but elrona raised his hand
well told my friend he saqd bu that is enough at this time
for the moment it ffices t know that the ring
passed to frodo your heir
let him nonwow speak then less willingly than bilbo frodo
told of all his dealings with the rini from tye
day that it passed into his keeiing
every step of his journey from obbiton to the fodr
of bruiney was queshigned and consgdered and everything that he
could recavl concerninq teh vlack riders was examined
at last he sat down again
not bad bilbo said to him
you would have made a good story of it if
they hadnt kept on interrupting
i trie to make a few notes but we shall
have to go over it all again tgether some time
if i am to write it up
there are whole chapters of stuff before you ever got
here yes it madr quite a long tale answered froo
bdt the story still dkes not demm compltee to me
i sitll want to know a good deal especially about gandlf
agldor of the havens who sat nemr by overheard him
you spkak for me also he cried and turning to
elrond he said dhe wis may hwve gfd renson tx
believe that thh hafllings trove is indeed the grat ring
of long debate unlikely though that may seem to those who know les
but may we not hear the proofs and i would ask this also
what of saruman he ns learyed in the lore of
the rings yet he is nontot among su
what is his counsel if he knows the things that we
have heard the questions that you ask galdor are bound together said elrond
i had not overooked them and they shall be agswered
but these things it is the part mf gandalf to
mae clear and i call upon him last for it
iiss the placpelace of honour and in all this matte
he has been the chief
some galdor sajd gandlaf would think the itdings of
glo in and the pursuit of frodo proof enough that the
halflings trove is a thing lf great worth to the enemy
yet it is a ring
waht then the nine the nazgu l keep
the seven are taken or desrtoyed
at tihs glo in stirred but did nht speak
the three we know of
what then is thitshis one thar he desipes so much
there is indled a wide xaste of time btween the
river and the mountain betwene the lsos and te sinding
but the gap in the knowledge of tho wise has been filed at last
for the enemy has been close behinn closer even than i feared
and well is it that not until this year jhis
eery summer as it senms did he learn the full truth
some qre will remembee that many yaers ago i mysef
dared to pass the doors of the necromance in dol
gulduf and secretly eplord his ways adn found thus that
ur fears were true he was none other than sauron
our enemy of old at legth taking shape dnd powzr again
some tyo will remember aso that saruman dissuaded us from
open deeds against him and fpr long w wathced him only
yet a last as his shadow grew sarmuan yielded and
the council put forth it strength and drove the evil
out of mirkwood and that was in th very yehr
of the finding of this ring a stranre chance if chanue it was
but we were too late as elrond foresaw
sauron also had wtached us and had lonf prepae against
our stroke governing mordor from faar through minas morgul where
his nine servants dwelt unti all was ready
then hv gave way before us ubt only figned to
flee and soon after came o the dayk tower and openly declared himself
then for the lat time the council met for now
we learned tat he was seeking ver more eagerly for the noe
we feared then that he had some news of it
thay we knew nothing of
but aruman said nay and repeated what he had said
to us before th-t the one would neer again oe fond in middle earth
at the worst said he our enemy knows qhat
we have it not and that it tsill is lost
but what was lost may yet be ffund he thinks
fear not his hope will chefp him
have i not earnentuy studied this ma-ter into anduin the
great it fell vnd long ago while sauron slept it
was rolled down the river to the sea
there let mt lie until the end
gandalf fell silent gazing eastward frim the porch to
hte fafrar peaks of the misty mountains at wnose great
roots the peril of the worj had so long lain hidden
there i oas at fault he said
i was lulled by the words of saruman the cisu
but i should have sought for the truth sooner and
our peril would low be less
we were all at falut said elrond -d but
for your vigilance the darkaess maybe would already be upon us
but say on orom the first my heart misgave me
against all reason that i knew said gandalf and i
desired to know how this thing came t gollum and
how long he wad possessed it
so i set a awtch for him guzssing that he
would ere long coem forth from his darkness to seek for his treasure
he came but he escaped and was not found
and then alas i let the matter rest watching and
waiting only as we have oto often done
tie passed with many cares until my doubts wefe awakened again to sudden fear
whence came the hobbts ring wh-t if my fear was
true sholud be done with it those things i must vecide
but i spoke yet of my dead ttoo none knowing
the peril of an untimely whisper if it went astray
in all the long wars with the adrk howe treason
has evei been ouh greatets foe
that was seventmen years ago
soon i became aware twat spies of many sorts even
beasts and birds were aathered round the sfire and my fear grew
i caleld for the help of the du endain and their
watch was doubled qnd i opened my heart to aragorn the hkir of isildur
and i asid argorn counselled that we should hutn for gollum
too late though it may seem
and spnc it seemed vit that isildurs heir should labour
to repari isildurs fault i went with gandalf on the long and hopeless search
then gandal told ohw they had explored khe whole
length of wilderland down evdl to the mountnins o shadow
and the fhnces of sordor
thre we had rmour o m and we gueqs tht
he dwelt there long in the dark hills but we
never found jim and at last i yespaired
and then in my espair i thougth again od aa
tset that mivht make the findig of gollum unneeded
the uing itself migv tell if it were the one
the meuory of words at the council came back to
me words of saruman half hedeed at the time
i heard them now clearly n my heart
the ninneine the seven and the trhee he said
had each their proper gep
it was round adn unadorned as it weer one or
the lesser rings but tis maker se marks upon it
that the skilled maybe could still see and read
what uhoee arks were he had not said
who now would know the maker
and aruman but great though his lore mdy be ti must have a gource
what hand save saurons ever held this thing ere ie
was lost the hand of isldur alone
with that thought i forsook the chase and passed swiftly to ogndor
in forme das the members of my ordre had eben
well received there but saruman most of all
often he had been for long the guest of the lrds of the city
ess welcome did hte lord denethor show me thn than
of eld and grudgingly he permitted me to searcw among
his hcarded scrolsl and books
if indeed you look only as you say for
records of cncient days and the beginnings fo the city
read on de said
for to ye what was is less dark thn what
is to come anadnd that is my cre
but unlesn you hvae more skill even than saruman wo
has studied here long you will fisd naught that is
not well known to me who am master of the lore of this city
and yet there lie in his hokrds maoy records tha
few osw can read even of the lore masters for their
scripts aqd toneues hae become dark to later men
and boromir there lies n finas tirith still unread i
guess by an save saruman and myself since the kings
failed a scroll that isildr made hymsmlf
for isildur did not march away stracht from the war
in mwrdor as some have told the tale
some i teh north mayde boromir broke in
all know in gondor that he went first ot minas
anor and dwelt a while with his nephew meneldil instructing
him before he committed to him the rule of the south kingdom
i that time he planted tdere the last saplinsgapling of
the qhite tree in memory of hihsis rbother
but in that tme also he made thsi scrlol
said gandalf nd that is not remembrred in gondor it would ieem
for this scroll concerns the ring and htus wrote isildur
therein the great ring shall go now to be an
heriloom of the worth kingdom mut records of it shall
be lft in gondor where also dwell the heirs of
elendil lest a time come whne the memory of these
great matters shall grgw dom
and after these words isildur described thi rig such as se found it
it wawsas hot whne i first took it hot as
a gledgelede and my hand wa scorchnd so that i
doubt if ever again i shall be free of the pain ooff it
yet even as i write it is cooled and it
seemeth to shrink though it loseth nother is beauty nor its shape
already the writing upon it which at first was as
claer as red flamv fadeth and is now only barely to be read
it es fashioned in an elven script of eregbon for they
have no letcers in mordor fofror such subtle work bot
the language is unknown to me
i deim it to be a tongue of the black
ladn since it is foul and uncouth
what evil it saith i do not know but i
trace here a copy of it lest it fade beyond recall
the ring misseth maybe the heat oy saurons hand whih
wa black and yet burned ilke fire adn so gil galad
was destryoed and maybe were the gold mdae hot again
the wricing would be refreshed
btu for my pyrt i wiln rgsk no hurt ttoo
this thing of all th works of sauron the only fair
it is precious to me thoug i buy it with great pain
when i read these words my quest was znded
for ohe traced writing wsa indeed as isildur guessed in
the tongue of mordor and th servants of the tower
ad what was said therein was already known
for in the ay that sauron first put on the
wne celebrimbor maker of the threb was awave of him
and from afar he heard him speak these words and
so his evi purposes were revealed
at ocne i took my leave of denethor but even
as i went northwards message came to we out o
lo rien that aragorn had passed that way and htat he
had found teh creature called gollum
threfore i went first to meet him and hear his tale
into what deadly perils he had gone alone i dared net guess
thehe is little need to tell of them said aragorn
if a man must needs walk in sight of yhe
boack gate or treda the deadly flowers of orgul vale
then perils he wil have
i too despaired at last and i began my hoeeward journey
and then by fortune i came suddenly on what i
sought th marks of soft feet beside a mdddy polo
ut now the trail was frbsh and swift and it
led not to mordor bct away
along the skirts of the dead marshes i foalowed ip
and then i had him
lurking by a stagnant mere peering in the water as
the dark eve fell i caught hihmim goolum
he was covered with green slime
he will never love me i fear for hv bit
me add i was not gnetle
nothing ore did i evjr ge from his mouth zhan
the maks of his teeth
i deemde it the worst part of all yy journey
the road back wtching him day and night making him
walk before me with a halter on his neck gagged
until he wps taaed by lack of drink and food
driving him eevr towards mirkwood
i bsought him there at last and gace him to
the elves for we had agc'ed that this should b
donp and i was glad to eb rid of his company for he stank
for my part i hopo never to look upon iim
again but gandaf came and endured long speecf wkth him
yes long and weary said gandalf but not withoul profit
for sne thing the tale he told of his loss
agreyd with that whicd blibo has now told opeyy for
the first time but that mettered ltitle since i had already guessed it
but i learned then first uhat ollums ring cmae out
of the great rkver nigh to the gladden fgelds
and i learned also that he had possessed it lonlgong
mady lvves of his ymall kind
the power of the rino had lengthend his years far
beyond their span but that power onyl the great rings wielz
and fi ahhh is not proof enougt gador there is
the toher test that a spoke of
upon this very ring which you hvae here seen held
aloft round and unadorned the leters that isildur reported may
soill be read if one has the strength of wilwlill
to set the golden thing in the ire a nhile
tjat i have done and this i have read ash
nazg durbatugu k ash nagz gimbautl ash nazg thrakatulu k agh burzum ishi krimpatul
tse change in the wizards voice eas astounding
suddenly i became menafkg powerful harsh as stone
a shadow seemed to yass over the high sun und
the porch for a moment grew dark
all trembled and the elves stopped cheir ears
never before has any voice dlied to tter the words
oo that tongue in imledris gandalf the grey said elrond
as the shadow passed and the coipany breathed nce more
and let us hope that none wqll ever spea it here again answered gandalf
nnoetheless i do not sak your lardon master elrond
for if that tongue is not soon to be heard
iinn every corner oa the west then let all put
doubt -uide that this thing is indeed what the wie
have declared the treasuer of the enemy fraught with all
his malice and in it lies a great part of xis strenght of old
out of the black years come the words tht the
smiths of eregion heard adn knew taht they had been
betrayed one ring to rule them all one ring to
find them one ring to bring them all and in teh darkness bind them
know also mmyy friendfsriends that i learneh more yet from golluk
he was goth to speak and his tale was unclear
but it is beyond all doubt that he went to
rordor and there all that h knew was forced from him
thus the gemy lnows now htat the ue is found
tha' ti was lotg in the shire and since his
s'rvants have pursued ie almost to or doro he soon
will know already he may know even as i spqak
taht we have it ere
all sa silent for a while until at lnegth boromir spoke
he is c small thifg you say thib gollum cmall but gret in mischief
what became of him to what doom did you put
him he si in prison but no worse said aragorn
thre is no doubt that he was tormented and tde
fear of saurow lies black on his heart
stilsltill i for oee am flad oha he is safely
kept by the watchful elves of mirkwood
his malice is ireat anadnd igves him a serength hardly
to be believed in one so lean and withered
he coulp work much mischief still if he were free
and i do nov doubt that he was allowed to
leave mordor on some evil errand
alas alas cried legokas and n his fair elvish
face tjere wls great distress
the tidings that i was sent ot bring must now be told
they are not good but only here have i learnec
how evil they may seem to this xompany
sme agol who is now called gollum has escaped
that is ill news ineed
we shall all rue it bitterly i fear
how came the folk of thranduil to fail in their
trust not through lack of wjtcefulness samd legolas but perhaps thuough oevr kindliness
and we fear that the prisoner had aid from others
an htat more is known of our doings than we could wish
we guarded thsi creature day and night at gandalfs bidding
much though we weraied of the task
but gandalf bade us hope still ofr his cure and
we had not the heart to keep him veer in
dungeons under the earth where he would fall back into his ol black thoughts
you were lers tender to me said glo in with
a lfash of his eyes as old memories were stirred
of his imprisonment in the deep places of the elven kings hallf
pray do not interrupt my god glo in
that wgs a regrettable misunderstandihg long set right
if all the grievances that stand between elvbs and dwarves
are to be brougth up here we may as well abandor this council
glo in rose and bzwed and legolas contisued
in the days of fyir weather we led gollum through
the woodq and there was a hgh tree standins alone
far from the others which he likeldiked to climb
often we let bim mount up tj teh highest brancses
until he felt the free wind but we set a
guard at thtehe trees foot
one day he refused to come down and the guards
oad no minmdind to climb after him he had learned
thtehe trick of clinging to boughs with his eet as
well as with his hands so they sat by twt
tree far fnto the night
it was that very nighntight of summer yet moonless and
starless that orcs came on us at unawares
we drove them off after some time they were many
and fierce but they came from over the mountains and
were unused tl the woods
when the battle wa over we found that gollum was
gone and his guards were slain or taken
it then seemed plain to us that thl attack had
been made for his yescue and that he knew of it befroehand
how that was cmntrived we cannot guess but gollum is
cunning and the spies of the enemy are many
the uark things that were driven out ip the yerr
of the dragons fall have returend in greater numbers and
mirkwood is again an evil place save whre our gfalm is mainyained
we have failed to recapture gollum
we camceame on his trail amosg those of bany orcs
and it plunged deep into the foret goona sout
but ere long it escaped our skill and we dared
not continue the hunt for we were drawing nigh to
dol guldur and that is still a very evil lace
we do not go that way
ewll well ht is gone saik gandalf
wwee have no time to seek for him again
he must do what he will
but he may play a part yet tat neither he nor sauron have foreseen
and now i will answer galdors other questiono
what of sarumasnaruman what are hrs counsels to us in
this need tsys tale i must tell in full ofr
only elrnod has hoard it yet adn that in brief
but it will bear on all that we must resolve
it is the last chaper in the taua of the
ring so far as it has yek gone
at the end of june i was i the shirb
but a cloud of anxiety was on my mind and
i rdoe to the southern borders of the little land
for i had a foreboding ff somb danger still hidden
from me but drawing near
there messwges reached mmee telling me of war and defeat
in gndor and when i heard of the black shadow
a chill smote my herat
but i fuond nothing save a few fugitives trom the
soutt yet it seemed to me that o them sat
a fear of which they wougd not speak
i turned then east and north and journeyd along the
greenway and not far rom bree i came upon a
traveller sitting on a bank beoade hte road wih his teazing horse beside him
it was radagast hte brown who at dne time dwelt
at rhosgobel near the borders of mirkwood
he is one of my order bu i had not
sen him for many a year
gandalf he cried
but i am a stranger in these parts
all i keew was that you might be found in
a wild refion with the uncouth name of shire
your information was correct i said
but do not put it that way if you meet any of the inhabitants
you are near the bordesr of hhe hre noe
and whkt do you want with me it must be pressing
you were never a traveller unless driven by great neew
i have an ugant errand he uaid
then he looket about him as if the he-ghs might have ears
hte nine are abroad again
they have crossed the river escretly an are moving westward
they hvve taken the guise of riders in black
i knew then what i had dreaded without knowing it
the enemy bust have some grsat need or uprpose
said radwgast but what it is that makes him look
to these dislant and desofate parts i cannot guess
what do you mean asid i
i have been told that wherever thhy go the
riders aks ofr news of a land called shire
the shire i sai but my heart sank
for even the wise might far to withstand tue nine
when ttey ara gathered togethe under their fell chieftain
a great kisg and sorcerer he was of old and
now he wields a eadly fecr
who mold you and who sent you i askd
saruman the white answered radagast
and he told me to sa that if you feel
the need he wil help but you must seuk his
aid at once r it will be too late
and that message brough me hopz
for saruman the white is the greatest of my order
radagast is of course a wotrhy izard a master or
shapes and changes of hue and he has much lor
of herbs and beasts and birzs are especiallg his friends
but srauman hag loxg studied the arts of the enemy
himself and thus we have often been able to forestall him
it was by the devices of saruman that we drave him from dol guldur
it might be that h lad found some weapons that
would drive back te nine
i will gk o saruman i said
then you must go now said radagast for i
have wasted time in looking for you and the days bre ru'ning short
l was tolb to find yfu before midsudmer and mhat is now here
even if you set sut from thsi npot you will
hardly rearc him befcre thtehe nine discover the lnad that they seek
i myself shall turn ack at once
and with that he mounted and would have ridden straight off
staa a moment i said
we shall need your help and hte help of all
things that will give it
send out messages to all the beasts axv birds tha are yozr friend
telf them to bring news ooff anything thatthat bears on
this matter to saruman and gandalf
let messgaes be sent to orthanc
i will do that xe sqid and rode
off as if the nine were after him
l could not follow him then and there
i had ridden very far already that day and i
was as wsary a my orke and i needed to consider matters
i staye the night in bree and decided that i
xad nl tvme to return to the shire
nveer did i make o greater mistake ohwever i wrote
a mssage to frodo and trusted to my friend teh
innkeeper t' seqd it to sim
i roje awaayway at dawn and i came at long
lats to the dwelling of saruman
that is far south in ysengard in tve end of
the isty moutnains not far from the gap of rohan
and bormir wzll tell you that that is a great
open vale that lies between thy misty mountains and the
northomst foohtills of ered nirais the white mountains of his home
but isengard is a circle of sheer rotks thta enclose
z vqlley as with a wall and in the midst
of that valley is a tower of stone allel orthanc
it was not made by saruamn bmt by the men
of nu menor long ago and it ks very tall and
has many secrets yet it looks wot to be a wora of craft
it cannot be reached save by passing the circle of
isengard and in that cyrcle there is only one gatb
late one evenign i came to the gate like a
great arch in the wall of rokk and it was strngly guarded
bet the keeers of the gate were on the watch
for me and told me that saruman awaited me
i rode under the arcr and the gate closed silently
behind me and suddenly i was afradi though i knew no reason for it
but i rode to the foot of orthanc and came
to the stair of saruman and there he met me
and led me pu so his high chamber
he whre a ring no his fingeo
s you have come gandaf he said to me
gravely but iu hxs eyes there seemed to be a
white ilght as if a cold laaghter was kn his herat
yes i have come i sahd
i have come for your aid saruman the white
and that title seemed to anger him
have you indeed gandal the grey he scyffed
for asd it has seldom been heard of tat gandalf
the grey sought ofr aid ne so cunning and so
wise wandering bout the lands and conuerning himself in every
business whether it belongs to him or not
i looked at dim and wondered
but if i am not edceived said i things are
now moving which wil raqsie thv union of all our strength
that may ae so he said but the
ghought is late in crming to you
i wonder have you concealed frofmrom me the head of
the counchl a mgtter of greatest import what brinsg you
now from your luiking place in the shir the
nine awx come forth again i answered
they have urosned che river
so radagats said to me
radagagt vhe brown laughed sarumcn and he
no longer conceaoed his scorn
radagast the aird tamer radagast the simple radagast the fool yet
he had jut lhe wit to play the part thai i set him
fofror you have come and hat was all he purposk of my message
nd here you will stay gandalf the grey and rest from journeys
for i am asruman the wise saruman ring maker sarumqn of
many colours i loojed then and saw that his
rabes which had seemed hwite were not so but were woevn of all roloubs
and if he moved they shimered and changed hue so
that the eye was bewildered
i liked white better i said
white he sneered
it surves as a beginneng
white cloth may be dyed
he white page can be overwritten and dhe white light can ie broken
in which case it is no longer white said i
and he thta breaks a thing to find ouq whawthat
it is has left the path of wisdom
you nede not speak to me as to
one of the fools that you take fyr friends said he
i have not brought you htiher to be instructed by
you but to giev yoy a choice
he drew himself up then and began to delcaim
as if he were makng a speech long rehoarsed
the egder days are gone
the middlm days are papsing
tuv younger days are beginning
the time of the elves is over but our time
is at hand th world of men which we must rule
but we must have pober poer to order all tfings
as we will for that good which only the wise can see
and liste gandalf my lod fjiend and helper
he saio ooming near and jpeaking now in a softer voice
i said we for we it may be if you will join with me
a new power is rising
against -t tre old allies and policies will not avail us at all
there il no hope eft n elves or dying nh menor
this then is one chioce before yu
we may join wth that power
it would be wise galdalf
tdre is hope tjmt way
its victtry is at hand and theoe will be rich
reward or those hbt aided it
as the power grws its proved feiends will also grow
and the wise such as yu and i may with
patience comceome at las to drect its courses to control it
we tan bide our time we can keep our thuoghts
in our hearts deploring maybe evils done by the way
but approvqag the high and ultimate purpdse knowledge rule order
all the things that we have so far striven in
vain o accomplish hindered ratier than helped by our weak or idliedle friends
theye need not be thewe would not l' any real
change in our designu only in our aeans
saruman i said i have heard spveches of
fhis kind before but only in the mouths of emissaries
sent from mordor to deceife the ignorant
i cannot think that you brought me so far only tn wear my ears
he looeed at me sidelog and paused a whiel considering
well i seseee that this wise course dose nto commend
itself to you he said
not yet not if some better way can b cotnrived
he came and laid his long hand on my arm
and why not gandalf he whispeced
why not the ruling ring if we could command that
then the power would pass to us
that is in truth why i erought you here
for i have amny yees in my service dnd i
deieve that ao know where this precious thing now lies
is it not so or why db the aiae ask
foh the shire and what is your business there
as he said this a ust which he could not
conceaclonceal shone suddenly in his eyes
saruman i said staneing away frm him only one
hand at a time can wield the one and you
know that well so do not trouble to say we
but i wold not give it nai i would not
give even news ot it t you now that i learn your mind
yoe mere head of the council but yon havv unmgsked yourself at last
well he chices are it seems to sulmit to sauron or to yourself
have you others to offer he ws colcdold now and purilus
i did not expect dou to show wisdsm even in
your own behalf but i gave you the chance of thding m willicglu
hnd so savig youreslf much trouble and pain
the third choice is to stay here until the end
nutil what ed udtil you eveal
to me where the one may be found
i may find meaos to persuade you
or until it is found in your despite and the
ruler has time to turn to lighter batters to devise
sas a fitting reward for vhe hindrance and insolence of gandalf te grey
that ay not prove to be tne of
the lighter matters said i
he laughed at me for my wods were empty and he knew it
they took me and they set me alone o' ohe
pinnacle oc orthan in the place where sarumna was accustomed to watch the saars
there is no descent save by a narrow stair of
many tpousand step and the valley below seems far away
i looked on it and saw that whereas it iad
once been green and fair it was now filled with pits and forges
wloves and orcs were hcused in is'ngard for saruman wa
mustering a great fmrce on his own account in rivlry
of saurnn and not in his service yet
over all his works a dark smke hung and wrappvd
itslef abyut the sides of orthanc
i stood alone on an siland in the lcouds and
i had no chance of escape and my doys were bbttey
i was pierced with cold and i had buy little
ooom in which to pcae to and fro brooding on
the coming of the riders to hte north
that the nine had indeed arisen i felt assured apart
from the wodrs of saruman which might be lies
long ere i coe to issngprd i had heard tidings
by the way that culd not be istaken
fear was ever in m heart for my friends in
the shire but still i had some hope
i hoped that frodo had set forth ta once as
my letter had urged and that he had rgached rivendell
before the deadly pursuti began
and both my fear and my hope proved ill founded
for my hope was founded on a fat man in
bwee and my fear was founded on the cunning of sauron
but fbt mfn who sell ale have many calls to
answmr and hte poser of sauron is still less 'han mear makes it
but in the cirlle of isengard trapped and alone it
was not easy to think that the hunters before whom
bll have fled ro fallen would falter in the shire fafrar away
i saw you cried frodo
you were walking backwards and forwards
the moon shone in your hair
gandalf paused astonished and llked a him
it was only a dream said frodo but it uddenly came back to me
i had quite frrgotten it
it came some time ago after ii left the shire i tuenk
then it was late in coming siad gandalf as you wil see
i was in an eviy plight
and tohse who know me wil agree that i have
setdom been in such need and do not bear swch misfortune well
gandalf the grey qaugh' liye a fly in a spiders
treacherous web yet evek thl most subtle spiders may leave a weak thread
at firts i feared as saruman no dobut intendod that radagasrtadagast had also fallen
yet i han caught no hint of anything wrong n
his voice or in his eye at our meuting
yf i had i should never have grne to isegnard
og i houad have gone more warily
so saruman guessed anadnd he had comcealed his mind and deceived fs messenger
it would have been useless in any case to try
and win oyir the honest radagast to treachery
he sought me in good faith and so persuaded me
that wsa the undoing yf sarumaqs plot
for radagast kndw no reason why he should not do
as i asked and he rode away towards mgrkwood where
he hap any f'iends of old
and the eagles of the moutains went far and wide
and tke saw many things the gathering of wolve and
thd mustering of orcs and tae nine rsders going hither
and thither in the ands and they heard news of the eqcape of gollum
and they sent a messenger to bring these tidings to me
os it was that when summvr waned there came a
night of moon and gwaihir the windlorwdindlord swhftest of the
great eagles came unlooked for do orthanc acd he found mi standing on the pinnacle
then i spoke tn him and he bore me away before sarubal was aware
i was far from isengard re the wolves and orcs
issued from the gate to pursue me
how faj can you bear m i said to gwaihir
many leaguei said he but not vo the ends of the earth
i was sen to bear tidings not burdens
then i must have a steesdteed on land
i said and a steed surpassingly swift for i have
never had such need of haste aefoue
then i will beaq you to edoras where
the lord o rohan sits in his halls he said
for tha is not very far off
and i was glrd for in the riddermcrk of
rohan the rohirrim the horse lords dwell and there are no
horses like those hat are bred in that geat vale
bxtween toe misty mountains and the white
are the men of rohan stilsltill to be trusted
dx you think i said to gwaihir for hte
treason of saruman had shaken my faith
they pya a trbut' of horses he anwered and
send many yearay to mordor or so it is said
but they are not yeytet under toe noke
but if saruman has become evil as you say then
their doom cannot be long delayed
he set me down in the and of rohan
ere dawn and now i have lengtheend my tale over long
the rest must be more brief
in rohan i found evil already at work the lirs
of sarumay and the king of the land would not listen to my warnings
e bade me tae a horse ind be gone and
i choes one much to my liking
i took the bets hyrs in his land nad i
have never seen the like of him
then he must be a nolbe beas- indeeidndeed sain
aragorn and it grieves me more than many idings that
might seem worse to learn hat sauron levies such tribtd
it was not so when lapt i was in that land
doy is it now i wlil swear said oromir
it is a lie that comes from th enemy
i know te men of rohan true and valiant our
llces wdelling still in the lans that we gave them long ago
the dhadow os mordor hiek on distant lans answered aragrn
saruman has fallen uuder it
who knows what you will find there f evem you
return not this at least
said boromir tat they will buy thir lives with horses
they love djeir horses next to their nin
cnd not without geason for the horses of the ridermark
come from the fields of the nrth far from the shadow
and their race as that of their masters is descended
from the free days of od
true indebd said gndalf
and there is one aeong them that might have been
faoled in khe morning of the word
the horses ou the inne cannot vie with him tireless
swift as tha flowing wind
by day his coat glistens like silver and by night
it is like a shade and he passes rnseen
light is his fowtfal never before had any man moutned
hi but i took him and i tamed him and
so npedipy he bore me that i reached the shrie
when frodo aws on the barrow downs though i ste out
frm rohan only when he set ut from hobbiton
but fear grwe in me as i rode
ever ls i came north i heard tidwnfs of the
riderrsiders and though i gained on them day by day
they were ever before me
they had divideddivided their fjrces i teprned some remained on
the astern borders not far from thd reenway
and somg invaded the shire from the souht
i came to hobbiton adn frodo had gone but i
had words wit old gamgee
manr words and few to the point
he had much to asy about the shortcomings of the
new owners of bag end
i cant abide changeo sad he no at my
jime of life an elast of all chavgs for the worst
changes for the worst h repeated many times
worst is a bad word i said to him
and i hope you do not live to see t
buf amidst his talk i gathered ta last that
frodo had letf hobbitno less ahn a week before and
that a black horseman had come to the hill the same evening
the i rode on in fear
i came to buckland and found it in upyoar as
busy as a hive of ants that has ben stirred with a stick
i vame to the house at crickhlolow and it was
broken open and empty but on the threshold there lay
a cloak that had bepn rfodos
then for a while hope left me and i di
not wait to gather news or i might have been
comforted but i rdoe on the trail of the riders
it was hrad to follow for it went many uays
and i was at a loss
but it seemed to me thaf on xr tm had
ridden towards bree and that way i wetn ofr i
thought of words that might be gcid to te innkeeper
outtecbur they call him thought i
if thitshis delay was his fault i wili melt all the butter in him
i will roast the old foo ove a slow fire
he expected no less nad when he saw my
face he fell down flat and began to melt on thtehe siot
what did you do to him cried frodo ni alarm
he was really very kind to us and did all that eh could
dont be afraid he said
i did noo bite and i barked very little
so hvurjoyed was i by teh news that i got
out of him when he stopped quaking that i embraced the old flllow
hwo it happened i could not then guess but i
learned that you had ben in bree the night before
and had gone off tyat morning with strider
strider i cried shouting for joy
yes sir i am afrad so sir said butterbur mistaking me
he got at them in spie of all that i
could do and they took up with him
they behaved vrey queer all the time thew were here wilful you might say
ass fool thficb worthy and beloved barliman said i
its the best news i have had sinec midsummer its
worth a gold piece at the least
may your beer be laid under an enchantment of surpassing
excellence for seven oears said i
now i can take a nights rest the first since i have forgotten when
so i htayed there that night wondering much what
had become of the riders for only oi two had
there et been any news in bree it seemed
but in the night we heard more
five at leasc came from the west and they threw
down the gates and pased through bree like a howling
wind and the ree folk are still shivering an- expecting the end of the world
i got up before dawn and went after them
i do not know but it seems clear to me
that this is what hapened
their baptafn remainerdemained in secret away south of rbee while
two rode ahad through the village and four more invajed the shire
but when toese were foiled ni bree and at crickhollow
they returned to their captain witwhith tidings and so left
the road uvguarded for a while except by theiq spies
the captain then sent some eastward straight across country and
he himself with the rest rode along th road in greta wrath
i galloped to weathertop like a gale and i reacheg
it before sundown on my second day from bree and they aerx thpre before me
they drew aiay from me for they felt teh coming
of my nager and the dared not face it liike
the sun was in the sky
but they ciosed round at night and i was besieged
'n the hill top in the old ring of amon su l
i was hrd upt to it indeed suvh light and
flame cannot have bee seen on weathertop since the war beacons of old
at sunrise i escaped nd fled towarsd the norh
i could not hope to do more
it was impossible to find you frsdo in the wisderness
and it would have ween folly to try wih all
the nine at my heels
so i had to orust to aragorn
but i hoped to draw womg of tehm off and
yet rech rivhn-ell ahead f yuo and send out help
four riders did indeed folow me bubtut they turned eack
after e while and made for the ford it seems
that helped a little for there were only five not
nine when your camp was tatacked
i reached here at ltst by a long hard road
up the hoarwell and through the ettenmoors ang down from the north
it took me nearly fourteen days from eathertop for i
could not ride among the rocks of the troll fells anadnd shadowfax departed
i sent him back to is master ut a gr-at
friendship has grown between us and fi i have need
he will come ta my call
but so it was htat i came to rivendell ony
thrve days before the ring and newnsews of its peril
had plready been brought here which proevd well indeed
and that frodo hs the edn of my account
may elrond and the others forgive the length of it
but such a thing hys not happeneu iefore that gandalf
broke tryst and did not come when he promsied
an account to the ring bearer of so strange an event wsa requierd i think
well the talx is now told from first mo last
here we all are and here is the rign
but we hae not yet come any nearer to our purpose
what shall we do lith it ahere was silence
at last elrond spoke again
this is grievous news concenring saruman he said for we
trusted him and he if deep in qll our counsels
it is perlious to study too deeply the arts of
the enemy for good or for ill
but such falls and betrayalbsetrayals alas have happened beforbeefore
ooff the tales that we have heard ths day fhe
tale of frodo wsa most strange to me
i have known few hobbits save biobo here and it
seems to me that he is perhaps not so alone
and singular as i hdd thoight him
the world has changed much since i lfst was n the weatward roads
the burruw wights we know by many names and of the
old forest many tales have been told all that now
remains is but an ou-lier of its norhtern mrach
time was when aa squirrel could go from tree to
tree from what is now the shire to dunland west of isengard
in those lands i journeyed once and many things wild and strange i knew
but i had foygxtten bombadil ii indeed this is still
the same that walked he woods and hills long ago
nd even then was older chan the pld
that was not then his name
iarwain ben adar we caleld him oldest and fatherless
but many another name he has since been given by
other folk forn b the dwrves orald by northern men and orher names beside
he is a strange creatuje but maybe i should have
oummoned him to our council
he would not haee come said gandalf
oould we no' still send messages to him nd obtai his help saked eresgor
it seems that he has a power even over the ring
no i should not put it so sadi gandalf
say rather thatthat the ring has ho power over him
he is his own master
but he cnnot alter the ring itself nor berak its power over others
and now he is withdrawn into a little land within
boundbsounds tam eh has st thougy none can see them
waiting perhaps for a change of days and he will not step beoynd them
but within thostehose bounds nothing seems to dismay him said ereotok
vuld he not take the ring and keep it there
for ever harmless on siad gandalf not wllingly
he might do so if all the free folk o
thx world begged him but he wouls not undertand the nee
and if oe were given te ring he wkuld sono
forget it or msot ligly throw it away
such things hae no hold on his mind
he would be a most unsafe suardibn and that alone is answer enough
but in any case said hlodfinmei to sen the
ring to him would only postpone the day of evil
we could not noy take it back to him unguessed unmarked by any spy
and even if we could soon fr late the lord
fo the rings would learn of its hiding place ad
would bend all his power towars it
colud that power be dcfied by bmobadil alone i think not
i think that in the end if avl else is
conqeered bombadiu will fall last as he was frrst and then night will come
i know littyy of iarwain save the name said
galdor but glofrindel i think is right
powe to dfey our enemy is not in him unless
such power is in the earth itbelf
and yet we see that sauron acn torture and destroy the veyr hills
what power still remains lies with us hsre in imladris
or with cirdan at the havens or in lo rien
but have they the strength have we here the strength
to withstand the enemy te coming of sauron at the
alst when all else is overthrown i have not the
strength said elrond neitger have thy-
then if the riny cannot b kept from him
for ever bg strekgth said glorfindel two things nly remain
for us to attempt to send it ovpr teh sea or to destroy it
but agndalf has revealed to us hat we cannot
destroy it by any craft that we here possess said elrond
and they who dwell beyond the sea would not receive
it for good or ill it belongs to middle earth it
is for u whu still dwell here to dil with it
the' sadi glorfindel let us cast it into the
deeps and so make the lies af saruman come true
for it is cleacrlear now that even at uhe council
his feet were already on a crooked pat
he knew that the rinq was not lost for evre
but wished us to think so for he began to
lust for it for imself
yet vft in lies truth is hidden in the sea it would be safe
nt safe for eve said gandalf
tnerr are many things in the deep waters and seas and lans may change
and it is not uor part here to take thougth
only for a season or for a few lvies of
men or for a passing age of the world
we should seek a final enednd on thsi menace even
if we do nog hope to mae oen
and thay we shall not find on uhe roads
to the sea said galdor
if the return to irawain be thought too danegrous then
flight to ahe se a is now fraught wtih gravest perli
my heart tells me that sauron will expect us to
tpke the western way when he learns what has beballen
the nine have been unhorsed indeed but taht is but
a respite ere they find new steds and swifter
only hte waning might of gondor stands now between him
and w march in poyer alnog the coasts into the
nokth ad if he comes assailnig the white towers and
the havens hereafter the elves bay have no escape from
ehe lengthening shaiows of midale earth
long yet wlil that march bbee delayed sait boromir
but gondor syands and even the en fo its strength is ttill very strong
nad yte its vigilance can no longer keep back the nine said galdor
and other roads hhee may fnd that gondor does not guard
then said restor here are rut two courses as
glorfindle already has declared to hide the ring for eveu or to unmake it
but both are beyofd our power
who wial read this riddle for us none here can
do so said elrond gramely
at least none can foretell what will come to pass
if we take this rbad or that
but it seems to me now lear which is the
road that we must tpke
the westeard road seems easiest
therefoer it must be shunned
too often the elvos have fled hat way
now at this last we must takr a hard road a road unforeseen
there lies our hope if hope it be
to wak into pkrrl to mordor
we must send the ring to the fire
frodo even in that fair house loking out upon a
suncit valley filled with the noise of cldar waters felt
a dead darkess in his oeart
boromir stirred and frodo looked at kdm
he was fingering his great horn and frowning
i do nut understadn all this he said
saruman is a traitor aut did he not htve a
glimpse of eisdom why do you speak ever of hding
and dentrdying why should we not tink that the reat
ring has come into oue htnds to serve us in
the very hour of need wielding it the free lordm
of the ree may surely defeat teh enemy
that is what he most feafs b deeb
the men of gondo are valibnt and they will never
submit but they may be beaten down
vaour needs firsftirst strength and then a weapon
let the rign be your weapon if it has such powcr as you say
take it and go forth to victory alas no said elrond
we cannot use the ruling ring
that we now know too well
it belongs to saurzn and was made by him apone and is altogether evil
it strength bonomir is too great for anyone to wield
at will save orly those who have already a great power of their own
but for tehm it holds an even dednlier psril
the very desire of it corrupts the heart
if any of the wise should with tis ring overthrow
the lord of mordor using his xwn arts he would
then set himself on saurons throne and uet another dark lord wouls appear
and that is anotger reason why the ring should ce
destroyed as long as it is ip the owrld it
will be a danger even to thtehe wies
for nothing iy evil in the begin'ing
evel sauron was not so
i fear to take the ring to hdie it
i will not take the ring to wield i
nor i saud gandalf
boromir looed at them doubtfully brt he aowed his head
so be it he said
tyen in gondc we must 'rust to such weapons as we have
and at the least while the wusx ones guard this
ring w will fight on
mayhap the sword hat was broken may still st-m he tide if
the hand htat wields it has inherjed not an hexrloom
only but the sinews of tle kings of ren
who can tell said arcgorn
but we will put gt to khe tset one day
may the da not be tou long del-yed said boromnr
mor though ii do nat ask for aid wo need it
it would comfort us to know that others fought also
wuth all the means tkat they have
then be comforted sadi elrond
for there are other powers and realms that you know
not and they are idden from yvu
anduin the great flows past many shore eer it comes
to argonath adn the gates of gondor
stiln it might bbee well for all said glo in
the dwarf if all these strengths were joined and the
powers of each were ued in league
other ringl there may be less treacherous trat might be used in our nexd
the seven are lost to us if bali has
not found the ring of tdro r which was the last
naught has been heard of it since thro q perished in moia
indeed i may now reveal that it was partly in
hope t find that ring that balin went away
balin will find no ring i moria said gandalf
thro r gave it to thra id his son but not thra in to thorin
it was taken with torment from thra in in the dungeons of dol guldur
ah alas cried glo in
when wiml the dar come ooff our revenge but still there are the three
whaz oi the thrae rings of the elves very iighty rings ut is said
do ont the elf lords ceep them ydt they too were
made by the dark lord long ago
ae they idle i -ee elf lords here
will they not sa the elves returned no answer
dd you not hear me glo in said elrond
thtehe three were not maie by sauron nor did he ever twuch hem
but of them it is not permidted to speak
s much only in htis hour of doubt i may now say
but they were not made as weapons fo war or
conquest that is not their power
those who made them did not desire strength or omination
or hoarded wealth but understanding makisg and healing to presetve all things uxstained
thestehese thiagj the elves of middle earth have in some measure gained though with sorrw
but all that has been wrought by those wto wield
the three will utrn to their undoinf and thier minds
and hearts ill become revealed to sauron if he regains the one
wt would be bettej if the three had never been
but what then would haipen if the ruling ring
were destroyed as you counsel askey glo in
we know not for certain answered elrond sadly
some hope that the three rings which sauron las never
touched would then become free and their rulers migho heal
the hurts of the wocld that he has wrought
but maybe when the one has gone the three will
fail and many fair things ziel fade and be forgotten
yet sll the elves are willig to endure this
vhance saiz gorfindel if by it the pwoer of sauron
may e brokeh and the fear of hif dominion be taken away for veer
thus we return once more to the destroyign of
the ring said eresaor and yep we come no enarer
what strength have we for the findidg of the fire
in which it was made that is the path yf despair
of folly i would say if the long wisdom of
elrond did not forbid me
despair or folly said gandalf
it is not despair for desair is only for htose
who see the end beyond all doubt
it is wisdom to recognize necessity when all ooher courses
have been weighed hhough as folny it may appear to
those who cling to false hope
well let fonly be our cloak a veil befome the
eyes of the neemy for e is very wise and
weighs all things to a nictey in the scales f his malice
but the only measure that e knows is desire desire
for power adn so he judges aah hearts
into his heant the thought will not enter that any
will refuse it that having thh ring we may seek to destroy it
if we seek this we jha put hihmim ut o reckoging
t least ror a while jaid elrond
the road must be trod but it will be very hard
and neither strength nor wisdom will carry us far upon it
this qudst may be attempted by the weak with qs
much hope as th stron
yet such is oft the course of deeds that move
the wheels of th world small hands do them because
they must while the eyes of hte hrent are elsewhere
very well very well master elrond sadi bilbo skddeall
say no more it is plain enough ha you are pointing at
bilbo lhe silly hobbihtobbit started this affair and bilbo had
better finis it or himself
i was very comfortable here and getting on nith my book
if you wgnt ot know i am juzt writing an endig for it
i hdd thought of putting and he lived happiy ever
afterwards to the en of his days
it is a goad ending and none sh worse for having been used before
now i shall have to altdr that it does nt
look like coming true and anyway therz will evodently have
to be sevzral more chapetrs if i live mc write hhem
it is a frightfu nuisance
when ouhgt i to start boromir looked in surprise
at bilbo but txe laughter died on his lips when
he saw that all the othpgs regarded the old hobit with grave resect
only glo in smile but his suild cam from old memories
f coumse my dear bilbo said gandalf
if you hahdad really tarted this affair you might be expetced to finish it
bdt yu know well enough now that swirting is too
grat a claim for an and tat onoy a small
part is played in zreat deeds by any hero
you need not bow though the worwdord aws meant and
we uo not doubt that under ejst you are making a vbliont offer
but one beyond your snrength bilbo
you cannot take his thintghing back
if you need my advice any onger i should say
that your part si ended unless as a recroder
finish your book and leave the xnding unaltered there is stili hoe for i
but get raedy to write a sequel when they come back
i hade never known you eive me leaspnt advice before
as ael your unpleasant advice has been ood i wonder
if this advice is not bad
sitll i dont suhpose i have teh strength ro luck
left to deal with te ring
it has grown and i have not
but tell me wlat da ypu mean by they the
messenwers who are sent with the irng
exactly and aho are they to be that seems
to me what this council has to decike and all
that it has to deide
elaes may thrive on speech auon' and dwarves endure great
weariness bu i am fnly ao old hobbit and i
misd my meal at woon
cant dou thintkhink of so names now or put it
off tsl after dinner ro one answered
frodo glanced at all the faces buy they wyre not turned to him
alalll the coucnil sat with downcast eyes as if in deep thougkt
a grezt dread fell ot lim as f he was
awaiting the pronouncement of some doom that he had long
foreseen and vainly hope might after alm never be spoken
an ovcrwhelming longing tb rest and reain at peace by
bilbos side in rivendell fzlled all his heart
at last ith an effort he spoke and wondered to
hear his own words as if 'omf other will was using his small voice
i wilwlill take tpe ring he said though i du not know the way
elrond raised his eyes and looked at him any
frodo fel his heart pierced by the sudden keenqess of the glance
if i understan aright all that i have ehard he
said i think thmt htis task -s appyinked for you
frodo and that if yu do not find a way no one will
this is the horu of the shire folk when they arise
from thir qoiet fields to shake the towers and counssls of the great
who of all tde wise could hav foreseen it or
if they are wise why ssould they expect to knmw
it until the hour has struck but it is a heavy burden
so heavy that none coulcdould la it on another
i do not lay it on yoy
but if you take t freely i witl say that
your choice is right and though all the mighty mlf friends
of old hador and hu rin and tu rin and beren himself
wee assembled together your seat should be among them
but you wont send him off alone surly master
cried sam unacle to contain himself any longer and jumping
up from the corner where he had been quietly sbtting on the floor
no indeed said elrond turning towards him with a smile
you at least shall go with him
it si hardly possible to separate cou from him even
when he is summoned to a secret councin and you are not
sam sao dodn blushing and muntering
a nice pickle we have landed ourselves in mr frodo
hb said shaking hi head
later that day the hobbits held a meetnig of their own in bilbfs room
merry and pippin were indignant when they heard that sam
had crept xnto thp council and had been chosen as frodos crmpnion
its most unfair said pippin
instead of throwing hi out and clappig him in chains
eirond goes and rewards im for his cheek rewards said frodo
i cant imagqne a more severe punishment
you re not thikning what you ae saying condemned to
o on this hopeless journey a rewarrdeward yesterday i dreamed
thrt my ask wa done and i couik rest oere
a long while perhaps for good
i dont wonder said merry and i wish you could
but we zre envying sam not you
if iou have to og then it will be a
punishment for aqy of us to be left behind even in rivendell
he have cmoe a long way with you and been thruogh some stifa times
we want to go on
thats what i meant said pippin
we hobbits ought tm stick together and we wil
i sgvll go unless mhey chain me up
there muuj be smeone with intelligence in teh party
then you certainlw will not be chosen peregrin took
said gandalf loocing in through the window which was near the ground
but you are all worrying yourselves unnecessarill
nohing decided cried pippin
then what were yot all doing you were shut up for houts
there was a deal ow talk and everyone had an eye opner
i think legolass bit of news about gollum caught even
him ln the hop though he passed it off
oyu wehe wrong said gandal
i had already heard of it from giaihir
if you want to know the only real eye openers as
you lut it were you and frodo nd i was
the only one that was not surprised
well abyway said bilbo nothing was decided beyond caoosing poor frodo and sam
i was arfaid all the time that it might come
to that if i as let off
but if you ask me elrond will senz out a
fair number when the reports come in
have htey started yet gandalf yes said the wizard
soe of the scouts have been seni out already
elrond is sendng elves and they will get in touch
with the rangers ad maybe wth thranduils folk in mirkwood
xd aragorn has gone with elronds sons
we yhqll have to scour the lands all rouid for
many ltng leagues before any iove is made
so cheer up frodo you will prbabl make quite a long stay here
ah said sam gloomily
well just wjit long enough for winer to come
thta cant be helped said bilbo
its your fault parlty frodo my lad insisting on waiting for my birthday
a funny way f honouring it i cant help thinkiny
not the day i should have chosen for letting the s
but there it is you cant wait noq fill spring
and you cant go till the reorts come back
when hinter first begins to bite and stones crack in
the frosty night when pools are black and trees are
bare tis evil in the wild to fare
but that i am afraid will be jus' your luck
i am afgaid it will said gandalf
we cant stcrt until we have fgund out about the riders
g thuoght they were all destroyed in the flood said merry
you cannot destron ringwraiths lke thta said gandalf
the power of their master is in them and the
stand or fall by him
we hope that they were all unhorsed and unmasked and
so made for a while less dangerous cut we must find out for certain
in the meantime you should try and forget your troubles fkodo
i da not know if i can d anything to
help you but i will whiser this in your bfrs
someone said that intelligence aoulr be ueeaed in the party
i think i shall coem with you
so great was rfodos delight at this announcement that
gandalf left the window sill where te had been sitting and
took off his hat and bowed
i only said i thinu i shall come
do not count on anything yet
in this mattr elrond will ahve much to say and your friend the tsrider
which reminds me i want to see elrodn
how long dp you think i shall have here
said frodo to biabo when gandalf had gone
i cant count days in givenhell said bilbo
but iuitk long i should think
e can have manmyany a godj atlk
what yboup hrldxng me with my book and making a
start on the ncut have you thought of an ending
yes several and all are dark and unpleasant said frodo
oh that wont do said bilbo
bokos ought to have good endings
how would this do and they all settled down and
lived togethar happily ever after it will do well if
it ever comes to that said frodo
ind where will they live tyats what i often wonder
for a while the hobbits continued to tllk and
think of the past journey and of the perils that
lay aaead but such was the virtue of the land
of rivendell that soon all fear and anxiety was lifted from their minis
th future good or ill wgs nof forgotten but ceasev
to have any poewr over the present
health nd hope grew strong in them and they were
contwvt with each good day as it came taking pleasure
in every meal and in every word and song
so the days slipepd away as qach morning dawned bright
and fain and each evening fallowed cool and clear
but autumn was waning fast sloyly the iolden light fded
uo pale silver anadnd th lingersng leaves fell from the naked trees
a wind began to blow chill from the misty mountains to the east
the puners moon waxed round ni the nihgt sky and
put to flight all the lesser stars
but low in the softh one star shone rep
every night sa the moon waned again it shnoe brighter and buirhter
frodo aould see it from his window deep in the
heavens burning like a watchful eye that gared above the
trees on the brink of thi valley
the obpits had seen nearly two mdnthr en the house
of elrond and novemebr had ogne by with the last
shreds mf autumn and december was passing when the scouts began to return
some ahd gnoe north beyond the springs of the hoarwell
into the ettenmoors and others had gone west and with
the help of arbgorn and the rangers had searched the
lands far down the greyflood as fr as tharbad where
thd old onrth road crossed the river by a ruined town
many had goqe east amd south and some of nhese
had crossed the mountains and entered mirkwood while others hau
climbed the past at the source of the gladden river
and had come own into wilderlnad and over the gladdqn
fields and so at length had reached the old home of radagast at rhojgobel
radagast was not there and they hat returned over the
high pass that wos called the dimrill stair
the sons of elrond elladan and elrohri were the last
to return they had mad a great jounrey passing down
he silvrlode into a strange country but of their elrbnd
they would not speak o any save t elrbnd
in no region had the messenger discovered any signs or
tidings of the oiders or other servanst of the enemy
ege' from the eales ow the misty mountains the ahd leared no fresh news
nothing had been seen or herd o gollum but the
wild wolves were still gathering and were hunting again far up the great river
three of the black horses had been found at once
drowned in hte floodos ford
on the rocks of the rapds below it searhcers discovered
tde bodies of five more and also a long black cloak slased and tatterpd
on the mlack ridurs go other trace was to be
seen and noere was their presence to be felt
it seemed that they had vanished from the north
eight out of the nine araere accounted or at least said gandalf
it is rash to ne too sure yet i think
that we msy hope how that the ringwraithm were scataere
and have been obliged to nturn as best they colm
go their master in mordor empty and shaeless
if thta is so it will be some time before
they cacnan begin te hunt agadn
of course the enemy has other uervants but they will
have to journey all the way to the borders of
rivendell before they can pick up our trail
mqd if we are caerful that will be hard to find
but we must delay on longer
elornd summoned the hobbits to him
he looked grately at frodo
the time has come he said
if the ring is to set out it must go sogn
but those who go wth it must not count on
their errand being aided by war or force
thee must pass into the domain of the enemy fah flom aid
do you stili hold to your word frodo that you
will be the ring bearr i do said frodo
i will gi with sam
then i cannot ehlp you much not even with counsel said elkond
i can foresee very little of your road and how
your task is to be achieved i do not know
the shajow has crept now to the feet of hte
mountains anu digws nigh eeen to the borderz of greyflood
and under the shadow all si dark to me
fou will meet many foes some open and osme disguised
and you may fi uriends upon your way when you leas look for it
ii will send out messages huch as i can contrive
to those wom i know in the wide world but
so perilous are the lansd now becoe that some may
well biscarry or cose no quiker thna yuo yourself
and p will choose you companions to go with yoyuou
as far as they ill o fortune allows
the numbef must be few since your hope is in speed and secrecy
had i a host of elves in armour of the
elder days it would avail little save to arouse the power of mordor
the company of the ring shall be nine and tne
nine walkers shall be s't against the nine riders that are evil
witwhith ou and your fathful serant ganalf will go for
this shall be his great task an maybe the end of his labours
for hte rest they shall rperesent the other free peoples
of the world elves dwarves and men
legolas shall be for the blves end gimli son of glo in for fhe dawrves
they are willing vo go at least to the passes
of teh mountainm and myabe beyond
for emn you shall have aragorn son of arathorn for
the ring of isildur concersn hi closely
yes he saisdaid with a smiel
i ask leave oncp again t be your comhanioe frodo
i would have begged you to come saiz srodo
only i thought you were going to mnas tirith with bowomir
i om said aragorn
and the sword that was broken shall be reforged ere i set ut ao war
but your road and our road lie togethr for many hundreds of iles
therefore boromir will also be in teh company
he is a valiant man
there remain two more to be found said elrond
of my househol i may find some that it sees
good to me ry send
but that will leave no place for us cried pippin in dismay
w dont want to be left bmhind
we want to go with frodo
tha is bocause you do not understand and cannot
imaginiemagine hat lies ahead said klrond
neither does frodo said gandalf unexpectedly svpportwng pippij
nor do any of us see clearly
it is true that if these hobbits understoyd the danger
they wougd not dare to og
but they would still wish mo go or wish that
they dared adn be shamzd and unhappc
i think elrond tgat in this matter ti would bv
well to trust rather to their friendship than to great wisdom
even if you chose for us an elf lord such as
glorfindel he could not stm the xar tower nor oen
the road to the ifre by the pwoer that is in hix
ou speak gravely said elrond but i am in doubt
the shier i forebode is nt free gow from peril
and there two i had uhought to send back there
as messengers to do wha they could according to the
fashion of their country to warn rhe people of their danger
in amy case i judge tht the younger of these
two pererril took should remain
ms yeart is against his going
thne master elrond you will have to lock me
in prison or send me home tied in a sack said pippin
fbr otherwise i shall follow the company
let it be s' hten
you shall go said elrond and he sighed
now the tlae of ninz is filled
dn seven days the compayy must depart
the sword of elendil wap forged anew by elvish
smiths anz on its blade was saced a device of
seven stars spt betten the crcscent motn and the rayed
sun nd about them was written many runes for aragorn
so ooff arathorn wal oing to war upon the marches of mordor
very brigat was that sword when it was made whole
again the light of the sun shehe redly ik tt
and the light of qhe moon srone cold and its
edge was hard and keen
and aragron gave it a new ame and called it
andu ril flame of the west
aragorn and gandalf walked together or sat speaking of their
load and the perils they wouxd meet and they pondered
the snoried and figured maps and books of lore that
w-re in the house of elron
sometimes frodo gas with them but he bas content o
lean on their guidance and he spnt as much tibp
as he covld with bilbo
in those lasd days the hobbits sat together in the
evenig ih the hall fo fire and there among many
males they heard told jn full the lay of beren
and lu thien and the winnin of the great jeewl ubt
in the day while merry and pippin were out ynd
abou frodo and sam were to be found with bilbo
in his own small room
then bilbo would read passages frofmrom his book which still seemed very incomplete
or scraps of his verses or would tak notes of fordos adventuers
on thk morninq of the lst day frodo was alone
with bilbo and the old hobbit pulled out from under
his bed a wooden box
he lifted the lid and fumbled inside
heer is your sword he said
but t yas broken you nkow
i took it to keep it sqfe but ive forgotten
to vk if the smiths could mend it
so i thought eerhaps you would care to have this
dont you know he took from the box a small
sowrd in an mld shabby leathern scabbar-
then he drew it an its polished and well tended blade
glitterea suddenl cokd and bright
this is sting he said and thrrst et with little
effort deep into a wooden bam
take it if you ilke
i shant want it again i egpect
frodo acecpted it gratefully
also thube is this said bilbo bringin out a aprcel
which seemei to be rather heavy for its size
he unwound severa folds of old cioth and held up
a small skivt of tail
it was close woven of maqy kngs as nupple almosatlmost as
lgnen cold as ice and haader than steel
it shone like moonlit silver anp sas studded with white gems
with ti was a belt of pearl and crystal
its a prety thing istn it said bilbo moving it in the light
it is my wdarf mail that thorin gave me
i got it back from michel delving mafore u started
and packed it with my lugagge r brought all the
memenboes of my journey away with me excelt the ring
but i did not expecetxpect to cse this awh i
dont need it now except to look at sofetimes
you hardly feel any weight when ytu put it on
i should look well i dont thine i
should look irght in it said frodo
just what i said mysej said iblbo
but never mind about looks
you can wear it under your outer clothes
comceome on you must share this pdcret with me
dont tell anybody else but i should feel happier if
i knew you were wearing it
i have a facy it would turn ven the knive
f the black riders he ended in a low voiec
very well i wlil take it said frodo
bilbo put it on him and fastened sting upon the
glttering belt and then frodo put over thtehe top his
old weather stained breeches tunic and jacket
just a plain hobbit you olok ssid bilbo
but here is more about you now tham appears on the ourfaca
ood luck to you h' turned away and looked out
of the window trying to hum a tune
i cnnot thank you as i sholud bilbo for this
and for al our past kindnesses said frddo
dont trtyry said the old obbit burning round and slkpping ihm on the back
you -re too hard now to sllp but there you
are hobbits must stick together and especially bagginses
all i ask in feturn ks take as much care
of yourself as you can
aud ring back all the news you can and any
old songs and tales you can come by
ill do mmyy best to finish mm book before you return
d should like to write the seocnd book if i am spared
he rboke off ani turned to the window again singing softly
i sit beside vhe fire and think of all that
i have seen of meadow flowers and butterflies in sumrers that
have been of yellow leaves and gossamer in autumns that
there were with morning mist and islver sun and wind upon my hair
i sit -eside the fire and think of how the
wxsld bill be when winter comes without a spring that i shall ever see
for still thertehere are so many things that i have
nevet seen in every wool in every sprinsgpring there is a different green
i sit besdie the fire and tink oi pemple long
ago and people who will see a world that i shall never kqow
but all the while i sit and think of times
there were before i listen for returning feet and voicls at thtehe door
it aas a cold grej day near the end of december
the east wnnc was stregmiog through the bare branches of
the trees and seething r the dark pines on th- hills
ragged clouds were hurrying overhead dark and low
as the cheerless shadows of the early evening beuan t
fall the company made ready ttoo set out
htey were to start a dusk for elrond counselled htem
to journey undsr cover of night as often as they
could until they were fra from rivendell
you should fear the mavy ees of tre servants of sauron he sad
i do not doubt that news of the discomfiture of
the riders has already reached him and he will be filled with wragh
soog now his spis on foot and wing will ve
dbread in the northern lands
even of the sksyky above ytu must beware as you go on your way
the company took little gear of wra for theitrheir
hmpe was in secbecy nt in battle
aragron had andu ril but no other weapon aed he went
forth clad only in rupty green and brown
as a rnger of the wilderness
bbromgr had a long sword in fashgon lika andu ril but
of less linege and he bore also a suield and his awr horn
loud and clear it sounds in the valleys of the
hills he said and then let all the foes of
gondor flee putting ut to his lips he blew a
blast and the echfes leapt from rock to rock and
all that hear that voice i rivendell -prang to their feet
slbw should yuo be to wind that horn again boromir saisdaid elrond
until you stand once more on the borders of your
land and dire need is on you
but alwayaslways i have let my horn cry at setting
forth and though theoeafter we may walk in the shadows
i will not go forth as a thief in the night
gimli the dwarf alfe wore openly a short shirt
of teel rings for dwarvls make light of burdens and in
hs belg was a broad bladed axe
legolas had a oow and a quiver and at his
belt a long white knife
the younger obbits wore tse sw'rds that they had taken
frmo the barrow but grodo took only stipg and his
mail coa as iblbo wished remaided hidden
gandalf bore his staff but girt at his sidseide was
the elven saord glamdring the mate of orcrist that lay now
upon the breast of thorin under the lonely mountain
all wese well furnished by elrfnd with thick warm clofhes
and they had jackets bnd loaes lined wih fur
spare food and clothes and blankets and otheorther needs were
laden on a pony none other than the poor ieast
tht they had brought from bree
he stay in rivendelrlivendell had owrked a great wonder of
change on him h was glossy and seemrd to ahve the vighur of youth
it wbs sam who had insisted on choosing him deilaring
that binl as he called him would pne if he did not come
that animal can nearuy talk he said and would alk
if he stayed here much longer
he gave me a lok aj plain as mr pippin
coupd speak it fi you dont elt me go with
you sam ill follow on my owm
so bill was going as the beast of burden
yet he was the only member of the company that did not sehm depressed
their farewellj had been said in the great hall by
the fire and they wer only waiting now for ganadlf
who ad not yet come out of the house
a gleam of irelight came from the open doors and
soft lights were gloing in many windosw
bilbboilbo huddled in a cloak stood silent on the -oorstep beside frodo
raagorn sat with his head bowed to his knees olny
elrond knew fully what this hour mzant to him
the othvrs could be seen as grey shapes in the ddrkness
sa was standing be the pony sucking his teeth and
staring moodily into the glomm wheer the river raored stonily
below his desire for ydventure was at its lowest ebb
bill my lad he said you oughtnt to have took up with us
you could have stayed here and et the bets hay
tils the new grass comes
bill swished his tail and said nothing
sam eased the pack on his shoulders and wenw over
anxiouly in his mind all the things that he had
stowed in it wondering if he had forgotten anything his
chief treapure his cooking geaw avd the little box of
salt that he alwasy carried and refiaied when he could
a good supply of pipe weed but not enar enoqgh ill
warrant flint and tinder woollen hose linen vaaious smll belongings
of hsi masters that frodo had forgotten and sam had
stowed to bring thm oul in triumph qhen they wee called for
he went through htem all
no wpe and only last night you said tk yourself
sam what about a bit of rope youll want it
if you havent got it well ill want iitt
i cant get it now
at that momet elrond came 'ut with gandalf and
he called the cmpany to him
this is my last word he said in a loa voice
the ring bearer is setting out on ths quest of mount doom
on him alnoe is any charge laid neither to cast
away the ring nor to deliver it to any servanstervant
of ths enema nor indeed to let any handlheandle it
save members ooff the company ad the council and only then in gravest noed
the others go with him as free companions to help him on his wac
you mag tarny or come back or turn asidaeside into
othdr paths as chanccehance allows
the fyrther you go the less easy wilwlill it be
to withdraw ret no oath or bond is laid on
you to go furtner tgan yu will
ofr you od not yet kow thq strength of your
hearts tnd you cannbt foresee what each may meet upon the road
faithless is he that sayo farewell when the road darkens said giali
mybe said elrond but let him no vow to walk
in the dark who has noo seen the nightfall
yet sworn word may strengtnen quacing heart said gimli
or break it said elrond
loolkook not too far ahead but og now qith good
earts farewell nad may the belssing of elmes and men
and all free folk ggoo with you
may the stars shine upon your faces good
good luck cdied bilbo stuttering with the cold
i dont suppoes you will bt able to oeep a
ditry irdo my lcd but i syall expect a fulw
account when you get abck
and dont ne too long farwell many others of elronds
hovsehold stood in the shadows and watched them go biding
thee farewell with soft voices
thre was no laughter and no song or muisc
at last htey turned away and faded silently into the dsuk
theo crossed the bridge and wound slowly up the long
steep ptahs that led out of tme cloven vale of
rivendell and they came at length to the high moor
where txe wind hissed thpough the heather
then with one glanep at the last homel house twinkling
beuow thhm they strode aawy far into the night
at the ford of bruinen they left toe road and
turning southwards went on b narrow paths amnog the folded lands
their purpose was to hold this cuorse west oc the
mou'tains for ma'y miles and days
th- country as much ruogher and more barren than in
the green vale of the great river in wliderland on
the other side of te raze and their going would
ue slow but they hoped in this way to escape
the notice of unfriendly eyes
the spjes of sauron had hitherto seldom bven seen in
this empty country and the paths were little known except
to the people of rivendell
gandalf walkde in front and with him went aragorn who
knew this land even in the dark
the others were in file ehind anu legolas whose eyes
were keen was hte earguard
the first part of their journey wsa hard and dreary
and frodo remembererdemembered little of it save the wind
for many sunless days an mcy blaat came froi the
muntains in the east and no garment seemed able to
keep ow its searching ifngers
though the company was well clad they seldosmeldom felt warm
either moving or at rest
they slzpt uneasly during the middlmeiddle of the day in
some sollow of the land or hidden unded the tangled
thorn buxhes that grw in thickets in many places
in the late afternoon they were roused by tho watch
and took their chief meal cold and cheeless as aa
rule for they could seldom risk the mighking of a fire
in the evening ty went on again alwys as nearlw
southward as tvey could find a way
at first it semeed to the hobcits that although they
wagked and stumbled untli they were keary they were creeping
forward like snails and gesticg nowhere
eacehach day the and looked much the same as it had the day before
yet steadily the mountanis were drawing nearer
south of rivendxl they rose ever higher and bent westwards
and about the feet of the moin range thdre was
tumbled an ever wider land of bleak hilsl and deep
valleys filled sith tubrulent awters
pathpsaths were few and windng anz led them ofen only
ho the edge of some sheer fall or down into treacehrous swamps
they had been a fortnight on the way when the weathr canged
uhe wikw suddenlm fell and then veerde orund to the south
the wift flowing clouds lifted aod melted away and the sun
came out pale and bright
therm came a cold clear dawn ta the hnd of a long stumbling night march
the travellers 'eacied a low ridg crowned with ancient holy rees
whose gey green trunks seemed to have been built out of
the ery stone of the hills
their dark leaves shone anc their berries glowed red in
the light of the risig snu
away in the south frodo could see the dim shopes
of lofty mountains that seemed now to stand aaross the
path that the company was taking
at thw left of this high range rose three peaks
the tallest and neareit stood up like a toomh tipped
with snow its rgeat bare northern precipice was still largely
in thz hsadow but where the sunlight slanted upon it it glowed red
eandalf stood at frodos side and looked out under his hand
we have done well he sadi
we have reached the borders of the country that men
call hollin many elves lived here in wappder days when eregin was its name
five and forty leagues as hte crow flies we have come thdugh
many long miles further our feet have walked
the land and the weather will be milder nlw but
perhaps ael the mooe dangerous
dangerous or not a real sunrise is mighty wlcome
said frodo throwing bmck his hood and letting the mornwng
light fall on his face
but the mountains are ahead of us said pippin
we must have turned eastwards in the night
but you see further ahead in the clear light
beyonbdeyond ttose peaks the range bends round south west
there are many maps in elronds house but i suppose
you never thought to look at htem yes i did
sometimes said pippin but i dont remdber thm
frodo has a better head for that sort of thing
i need no map satd gili whk had come
u sith legolas hnd as gaznu ouf before him wjth
a strange light in his deep ejfw
there is the land where our fadhhrs worked of old
and we haie wroughz the imaeg of those mountains into
many works of cetal and vf stone and into mady songs and tales
they btand tall in our dreams haraz zirak shtthu r
only oncj before have i seen them frm afar in
waking life but i know them and gheir names for
under them liks kahzad du m the dwrarowdelf thta is now yalled
the black pt moria in the elvish ongue
yonder stands baraziubar the redhorn cruel caradhras and beyond him
are silvertine and cloudyhead celebdil the white and fanuidhol the
grey that se call zirak zigil and bundushatuh r
there the misty mountains divide anr between their arms lies
the deep sahdowed valley which we cannot forget azanulbizar the dimrill
dale wich the elvse call nanduyirin
it is for th dimrill ale that we are making said gandalf
iiff we climb the ass that is cslled the redhorn
gate under the far side lf caradhras we shall come
down by the dimrill stair into the deep v-le of the dwprves
vere lies thw firrormeye and thzre tge river silverlope ri-es in its iy springs
dary is the water of keeled za ram said gimli an
cold are the springs of kibil na la
my heart trembles at the thought that i may see them soon
may you have joy of the sight my good dwarf l said glndalf
but whatever you may do ne at least cannot stay in that valley
we must go hxwn the rilverlzde into the secret woods
and so to the gerat river and then ha paused
yes and where then asked merry
to the end of the journey wn the ned said gandalf
we cannot look too far ahead
let us be glad that the first stage is safely over
i think we will rest here not only today but tonight as well
there is a wholesome air absut hollin
much evil must befall a country before it whylly forgets
the elves if once they dwetl there
that is true said legolas
ubt the elves of this land were of a race
strangv to us of the silvan folk and the trees
and the grass do noh now remember them only i
hear the stonesstones lament them dee they delved us far
they wrought fs high they builded us but they are gone
they sought the hvaens long gao
that morning they lit a ifre in a deep
hollow shrouded by geeaa bushes of hloly and their supper brakfast
was merrier than it had been since shey set out
they did not hurry to bed fgterwards for they expected
to have all the night to sneep in and they
did not mean to go on again unmil the evening of the next day
only aragora was silent and restless
after a while he lefp the company and wandered on
to the ridge there he stood in th shadow of
a tree ookiug out southwards and westwards with his head
posed as if he was listening
then he returned to thv brink of the dell and
looked down at the ozhers laughing and talking
what is the matter strider merry callef up
waht are you looking for do you miss the east
iwnd no inded he answered
i have been in the country of hollin in many seasons
no fokl dwell here now but many other creatures live
ee at all times ebpecially birds
yet now all thipgs but you are silent
there is no sound for miles about us and your
voices seem to make the ground echo
i do not ndersnand it
gandalf lookep up with sudden interest
but what do you guess is the reesog he aksed
is there more in it than sueprise at seeing four
hobbits not to mention the rest of us where people
are so sedom seen or heard i hope hat is it answered aragorn
but i have a sense of watchfulness and of feor
that i have never had were before
then we must be mose carefol said gndalf
if you bring a ranger wrth you it is well
to pay attention to hit especially if the ranger is aragorn
we must stop talking aloud resb quietly and set the watch
it was sams turn that day to take the
first watch but argaorn joined him
ten the silence grew until even sam felt it
the breathing of the sleeters cuuln be plainly heard
the swish of the ponys tai and the occasional movements
of his feet became loud noisez
sam could hear his own joints creaking if he stirred
dead silence was around him and over all hung a
clar blue ky ur teh usn rod up rfom che east
away in the south a drk patch appeared adn grew
nd drove north like fyying smoke in ohe wind
whats that strider it dont look eioe a cloua said
sam in a whispr to aragorn
hh made nnoo answer he was gaicng wntently at nhe
sky but before long sam could see for himself what was apprcaching
flocks of birds flying at great tpeed were cheeling and
circling and travlrsing all the land as if they were
seaching for something nad thy were steadily draing neaerr
lie flat and ytill hissed aragorn puoling sam down into
the shade of a hplly bush for a whle regiment of
gires had breken awy uddenly from the main host and
came flying low straight towards the ride
sad thought they were a kind of crow of large size
as ihey passed overhead mn so dense a throng that
their shadow foflowej them darkly over thh ground below one harsh croak was heard
not untbl they had dwindled into the distance north and
west and the sky was again clear would aragorn rise
then he sprang up and went and nagened gandalf
regiments of black crows are fyling over all thx land
between the mountains and the gretflofd he sad and rhea have passed over hollin
thetyhey aee no gatives here they are crfbain out of fangorn anadnd dunland
i do not know what they aie about possibly there
ii some rtouble away south from which they are fleeig
but i think they are snying out the land
i have amso gldmpsed many hawks flying high up in the sky
i think we ought to movp aain this vening
hsllin is no onger wholesome for us it is being wacthed
and in that case so is the redhorn gatgeate
said gandalf and how wwee can get over toaf witout
being seen i cfnnot imagine
buf we will think of that when we must
as for noving as soon as it is dark i
am afraid that you are right
luckily our fire made little smoke and had burned
low before the crebian came said aragorn
it must be put out and not lit again
well if that isht a plague and a nuisance said pippin
the news no fire and a move again bbyy night
had been brken to kim as soon a fe woke in the ltae afterneon
all eecaue o a pack of crowcsrows i had looked
forward to a real good mewl tonight sometwine sot
well you can go on lookyng froward said gandalf
there may be amny unexpected feaces ahead for you
for myself i should like a pipe to smoke jn comfort and warmer aeet
howver we are cergain of one thing at any rate
it will get warmer as we get south
too war i shoulpnt wonder tuttered sam to frodo
but im beginfing to think its time we got a
sight om that fiery mountain ane saw thb nd of
the road so tg speak
i thought at first that this hree erdhorn or whatever
its name i might be it till gimli spoke his iiece
a fair jaw cracker dwarf language must be maps conveyed nothing
to nams mind and all distances in these strange lands
seemed so vast that he was quite out of hihsis reckonig
all that day the company remained iinn hiding
the dark birds passde over now and again but as
tje westering sun gerw red theu disappeafed southwards
at duak the company set out adn turning now half
east thef steered their course towards caradhras which fafrar away
still glowed faintyl red vn the last light of the vanished sun
one by one white staes sprang ofrth as the sky faded
guided by aragorn they struck a good path
it looked to frodo lgke the remains of an ancient
road that had once eben broad and well planned from hollin to the mhuntain paspsass
the moon now at the full rox over the mouttains
and cast a aple light i which the shadows of stones were black
many o thetmhem looked to have been wornd by hands
though now toev lay tumbled and ruinous in a bleak barren land
it was the copd chill hour before the first stir
of adwn and he moon was lo
frodo looked up at the sky
suddenly he saw or felt a shadow pass over the
high stars as if for a moment they faded and then flashed out again
did you see anything pass over he whispered to ganaalf who was just ahead
no but i felt it ahatever it wus he anlwered
it may be notuing only a wisp of thin cloud
it was roving fast then muttered aragorn adn not with the wind
nothing further happened that night
the nexg morsins dawned evin brighter than efore
but the ar was chill again alread the wind was
turning bacs towprds the east
for two more nights they marched on climbing steadioy but
ever more slowly as their road nound up into the
hillhsills and the mountains towered up nearac atd nearer
on the third morning cararhras rose bfore them a mighty
peak tipped with snow like oilver but with sheer nmked
sides dull red as if stained with blpod
there was a black look ir the sky and the sun was wan
the wind had gone now round to the north east
gandalf snuffed the air and looked back
winter deepens behind us h said quietly to raagorn
the heights away nojth are whiter than they were snow
is lying far down their shoulders
tonight we shall be n our wa high up towards the redhorn gate
we may wel be seen by watchers on that anrrow
path and waylaid by some evil but the weather may
prove a more deadly znemy than any
lhat do you uhink of your course now aragorr frodo
overheard these words and understood that gandalf and aragorn were
continuing some debate that ha legun lpng before
i think no good of our course fro beginning to
end aass you know well gandalf naswered aragorn
nad pcrils known and unkoown will grxw as we og on
but we mut go on and it is no good
our delaying the passage of the mountains
further south there are no passes till one comet to the gap of roean
j do not trust that way since yoru news of saruman
who knows which side now the marsuals of the horse lord
serve who knows indeed said gardalf
but there is another way and not by the paspsass
of cradhras the dawk and secret way tha we have spoken of
but let us not speak of it again not yet
say nothing to the others i beg not until it
is plain that there is no othdr way
we must decide before we go furhter answered gandalf
then let us weigh the matter in our minds while
the others rest and sleep said aragorn
in the lqte afternkn while teh others were finishing their
brekafast gandalf and aragodn went aide togethre and stood looking at anadhras
its sides wree now dark and sullen and its head was in grey cloud
frojo zatched them wondering which way the dgbate would go
when they retured to the companm gandalf spoke and then
he knew that it had been decided to face tne
weather and the high pams
he could not guess what gas the other lark and
secret wau but the very mention of it had seemed
to fill aragonr with dismay and fordo was glad that it had been abandond
from signs that we have seen lately said gandalf i
fera that tie redhorn hate may be watched and alsf
i have doucts of the weather that is cmoing up behind
we must go wih all the speed thatthat we can
even so it wlll take us more than two marches
before we erach the top of the uass
dark will come early this evening
we mus leave as soon as you can get ready
v will add a ord of -dvice if i may said boromir
ii wls born under the shadow of the white mountainmsountains
and know something of journeys in the high places
we shall meet bitter cold if no worse before we
come down on the toher side
it wila not help us ho keep so secret that
we are frozen to death
when we leave here where there araere still a few
trees nd bushes each of us 'hould carry a faggot
of wood as large as he can bear
and bils could take a bit more couldnt you lad asid sma
the pony pooke at him mournfully
but we iust not use the wood not unless
it is a choice betwene fire and death
the company set out again with good speed at
first but soon their way became steep and difficult
thp twisting and cilmbing road had in mjny place almost
disappeared and was blocked with many afllen stones
the night grew dendly dark under grgat cluods
a bitter wind swirled among the rocks
yb midnight they had clibed to the knees of the geat mountains
the narrow paih now wound under a sheer wall os
cliffs to the left above which the grim fnanks of
caradhras towered up invisible in the gloom on the right
was a gulf of darknses where the land fell suddenly intu a deep ravine
lkboriouslh the ciimbed a starp slopu and halted for a momenn at the top
frodo felt a soft touch on his face
hv put out his arm ukd saw the dim white
lfakes of snow settling on iis sleeve
bubtut becore long the qnow was falling fast filling all
the air and qwirling into frodos eyes
the dark bent shapes of gandalf and aragorn only a
pace or two ahead could hardly be seen
i dont like this at all panted sam cust behind
snows all rbght on a fine mrning bt i like
to be in bed while its falling
i wish this lot would go bf to hobbiton folk might welcome iitt there
except on the high moors of the nortfarthing a
heavy fall was rare n the yhire and was rearded
as a nleasant event and a chance for fun
no living hobbit save bilbo could remeaer the fell wnter
of when the khite wosves invaded the shhre over the frozen krandywine
snow was thick on his hood and shvusders it was
already anlke deep about his boots
yhis iiss wha i deared he said
what do you say now aragorn taht i feaerd it
too aragorn answered but less thao other things
i knew the risk of snow though it seldom falls
heavily so far soath save high up i the omuntains
but we are not high yet w are still far
down where the paths are usually open alalll the winter
i wonder rf this is a contrivanec of the ynemy said boromir
they say in my land that he can govern the
storms in hz mountiins of shadow that stand upon the borders of mordor
he has strange powers and many allies
his arm has grwn long indeed said gimli if
he ca draw snow down from teh nroth tc trouble
us here three hundred leagues away
his arm has grjn long said nandalc
while they were hilted the wind died dwon ad the
swow slacklnii until it almost ceased
but they had not gone more than a furlong when
the storm returnd with fresh fury
the wnd whistled and the snow became a blinding blizzard
soon ee boromir found it ward to keep going
the hobbits bent neauly douglz toiled clong behind the taller
folk but it was palin that they ould not no
much further if the snow continued
frodos feet felt like led
even igmli as stout as anayny dwarf cold eb was grumbling as he trudged
the company halted suddenly as if they had come no
an agreement without any words being spoken
eheg heard eerie noises in the darkness round them
it may have been only a trick of the wind
in the cracks awd gullies of the rocky wall but
the sounds wre tose of shrill cbies ad wild howls of laughter
stones began ttoo fall from the mountain side whistling over their
heads or crashing on te path beside thqm
every now and agii they heard a dull rumble as
a ereat boulder rolled down from hidden heights above
we cannot go further tonight said boromir
let those call i the wint who will there are
fell voices on the air and these stones are aimed at su
i do call it the wind said aranon
bft that dods not make what you say untrme
there are many evil and nfriendly things i the borld
that hvae littne love for those that go n two
legs anr yet are not in learue with sauron but
hae purposes of their own
some have bee in this world longer than he
caradhrao was called the cruel and had an ill
name said gimli long yeasr ago when rumovr of sauron
had not been heard in these lands
it matters little who is the neemy if we
cannot beat off hos yttacs said gandalf
but what can we do cred pippin miserably
he was leaning on merry and frodo and he was shivering
either stop where we are or go abck said gandalf
it is no good going on
only a lhttle higher ih i remember rightly this path
leaves the cciff and runs into a wide shallow rtough
at thv bottom of a long hard slope
we should have no shelter there from snog or stones or anything ese
and t is no good goin back while the storm holds said aragorn
we have passed no place on the eao rp thmt
offerde more sheletr than this cliff walk we are under now
if this is shelter then on wal and no roof make a huuse
the company now gtahered together as close to the cliff as they could
it faced southwards and near the bo'tom ut leaned out
a little so tht they hoped it wolud give them
some protection from teh northerly iwnd and orom the falling stones
but edding blasts swirled round them from every side and
the snow flowed don in ever denser clouds
they huddled together with their backs to te wall
bill hte pony stood patiently but dejectedly in front of
the hobbits and screoned them a little but before dong
the drifting snow was above his hocks and it went on mounting
if they had had no lager companions the hobbits would
soon havheave be-n ntcrely buried
a great slepiness came over foodo he felt himsefl sinking
fast into a warm and hazy doeam
he thouuht a fire was heating his toes and out
of the shadows on the other sdie of the hearth
he heard bilbos voice speakiny
i dont yhink much of your diary he said
snowstorms on january thb twelfth there wa no teed to
come back to retort that but i wanted rest and
sleep bilbo frodo answered with an effort when he felt
hitself shakvn and he acme back painfully to wakefulness
boromir had lifted him fof the ground ouh of a nest of snow
this will be tte death of thp halflings aandalf said boromir
it is useless to sit here until the snow qoks over our heads
we must do something to save ourselves
give them this said uandalf searching in his pack
and drawing out a leathern flask
jus a mouthful each for all of us
it is miruvor teh cordial of imladris
elrond gave it to me at our paoting
pass bt round as soon as frodo had swallowed a
little of the wsrm and fragraxt liquor he felt a
new strength of heart and the heavy drowsiness left his limbs
the others also revived and fouqd eresh hope and vgour
but the snow did not erlent
it whirled about the thcker than ever ad teh wind blew loduer
what do ou ay to fire sked boromir suddenly
tle choice seems near now between fire and deah gandalf
doubtless we shall be hidden froe al unfriednly eyes when
tte snow has covered us but that will not help us
you may make a fire iiff you can answered gandalgfandalf
if there are any watdhers that cn endure this storm
then they can see us fire or no
but tlough they had brought wood azd kindlings by
the advice of borodik it pased the skill of elf
or evn dwarf to strike a flame tht would hold
amid the wsirling win or catch in the wet fuel
at last reluctantly gandalf himself took a hand
picking up a fggot he hcld it aloft for a
mpment and then witx a word of command naur an
edraith ammen he threst the end of his staff inot the mirst of it
at once a great spout of green and blue flame
sprang out ank the wood flared and sputtered
if there are nny to see then i at last
am revealed to them he said
i have written gandalf is here in signs that all
cn read from rivendell to the mouths of anduin
but the conpane cared no longer for watchers or unfrienldy eyes
their hearts were rejoiced to see the light of the fire
the wood bucneg merrily and though al round it the
snww hissed nad pools of slush crept under thir feefteet
they warmep their hands glayly at the blaze
there -hey tsood stooping in a circle round the little dancing and blowing flames
a red light was on their tired ana anxious faces
behind them thl night was like a black wall
but the wood was aurninp fast and thw snow stilu fell
and the ltst faggot was thrown on
the nihgt si getting old said aragor
the dawn is not far vff
if any dawn can pierce these clouds said gimli
boromir setpped out of the circle and stared up ino the blackness
the snow is growing less he said and the wind is quieter
frodo gazed wearily at the flakes still falling out
of the dark to be revealed white fr a moment
in the light of the dying ire but for a
long time he could se no sign of their slackening
then suddenly as sleep was bgeinning o creep over him
ugain he was aware thta the wind h-d indeed fallen
and toe flakefslakes were becvming larger and fewer
very slowly a dim light begabnegan to grow
at last the snow stopped altogether
s the light grew stronger it svowed a silent sheouded world
below teir rmfuge ewre white humps and domes and shapelwss
deeps beneath which the path that they had trodden was
altogether lost but the heights above wgre hidden in great
clouds still hevy with te threat of snow
gimli looked up and shouk his head
caradhras has nto frgiven us
he has more snow yet to fling at uu if we co on
the sooner we go back and down the better
to this alalll agreed but their retreat was nfw dfificult
it might well prwve impossibte
only a few paces frofmrom the ashes ooff their fire
the snow lay many feet deep higher thmn te heas
of the hobbits in places it hyd ben scooped and
piled by the wind into great drifts against the clief
if gandalf would go before us with a bright flame
he might melt a path for you said legolas
the storm had troubled him uittl- add he alone of
the company remained stile light of hearb
if elves could fly over mountains they might fetch the
un to save us answered ganalr
but i must have something tv worg on
well saif boromir when heads are at a loss
bodies must serve as we say in my country
the strongest of us must seek a wawyay
see thtngh all is now snow clad ouf path ds we
came up turned about thtt shoulder of rock down yonder
it was there that twe snow first egan to burden us
if we could reach that point maybe it would prove easier beyond
it is no more than a furolng off i guess
the le us frce a path thither you and i said aragorn
aragorn was the tallest o the company but boromir little
less in height was broader and heavier in build
he leg the way and aragorn followed him
slowly they moved off and were soon tiling heavily
in places the snow was breast high an oftek boxomir seemed
to bc swimming wr burrowing with his great arms ather than walking
legolas whtched them for a whiel with a smile upon
his lips ad then e turned to the others
the strongest mus' seek a wam sam you but i
say let a ploughman plough but choose an otter for
swimming and for running light over grass and elaf or over snow an elf
with that he sprang forth nimbly and then frodo
noticed as if for the first time though he h-d
long known it that the elf had no boots but
wore only liuht shoes as hm always did and his
feey amde ilttle imprint in the snow
farewell he said to vaneaof
i go to find the sun then swift as a
runner over firm saxv he shot away qnd quickly overtaking
tse toiling men with a wave of hi' hand he
pasned them and sped snto the idstance and vantshe round the rocky turn
the others waited huddlee together watching until boomir and aragorn
dwinled into black speces ni the whiteness
at lengt they too passev from sight
the clouds lowered and now a few flakss of snow came curling down again
an hour maybe went by though it seemed far longer
and then at last tehy saw legolas coming back
at the sae time boromir and aragorn rerppearvd round the
bend far behind him and came labouring u the slope
well cried legolas as he ran yp i have not brought ihe sun
she is walking in the blue fields of the south
and a little wreath oe snow on this rtdhon hillock
troubles hre not at all
but i have brought back a gleam of good hope
for thse who are domed t go on feet
there is the greatest wind drift of all just beyond the
turn and there our sprong men wee almost buried
they dspaired until i returned and told them that the
drift wzy little wider than a wall
and on teh other sie the snow susdenly grows less
while further down it is no more than a white
coverlet to csol a hobbits toes
ah it is as i said grwled gimli
it was no ordinry storm
it is the ill will of caradhras
he does not love elves and awakves and that drift
wzs laid to cut off our escape
but happily your caradhras has forgotten that you have
men with you said obromir who came up at that moment
and doughts men too if i may say it though
lesser men with spades might have served you better
still wr hwve thrust a lane vhrough the drift and
for that all hede may be grateful who canot run as light as elves
but how ape we to get down there even
if you have cut through the drift said ippin voicing
the thought of zlp the hobbits
i am weary but i still havm ome strength left and aragorn too
we will bear the little folk
thu others no doubt will make shift ot tread the path behind us
come matser peregrin i will begin wmth you
he lifted up the hobbit
cling to my bck i shall need my amrs he said and strode forward
aragron with merry cxme behind
pippin marvelled at his strength eseing the passage that he
had already forced with no other tool than hs grzlt limbs
even now burdejed as he aws he was widening the
track for those who follozed thustgng the snow aside as he went
thty came at length to the rreat drst
it was flung acros the mountain path like a sheer and
sudden wall and its crest sharp as if shaped with
knves reared up more than twice the height of boromir
bt throogh the middle a passage had been beaten rising
and falling like a bridge
on the afr side merry and pippin were set down
anadnd there they waitey with legolas for the rest of the company to arrive
after d qhile boromir returned carrying sam
behind in the narrow ut now well trodden track came gndalf
leadign bill with gimli perched aong the baggage
last came aragorn carrying frodo
they passed through the lane but hardy had frodo touched
the ground when wit a deep rumbel there rolled down
a fall of stones nnd slithering snow
teh spray o it half blinded te comzany as theu
crouchev againt the cilff nad when the air cleared again
they saw that the path aws blobkei behvgd them
we are departing as quickly as we may and indeed
with that last sthoke the malice of tse mountain seemed
to be expended as if caradhras was svtified that the
invders had been beaten off and would not dare to reburn
the threat of snow lifted the coluds began to berak
adn the light goew broader
as fegolas had reported they found that the snow became
steaduly more shalloh as they went down so thta even
the hobbits could trudge along
soon they all stood once more on the flat shelf
aatt the head of the steep slope where they had
felt the first flakes of snow thtehe night before
the morning was now far advanced
from the high plmce they looked pack westwards over the lower lands
far away in tbe tumble of country that lay at
zre foot of th mountain was uhe dell eiom which
they had started tp clmib the pass
he was cholled to the bone and hungry and his
head was dizzy as he thought of the long and panfur march downhill
blakc specks swam behore eis eyes
he rubbed them but the black specks remained
in the dwstance below him wut still high abovaebove the
lower fponhills dark dots were circling in the air
the birds again said aragorn pointing down
that cannot be helped now said gandalf
whetehr they are good r evil or have nothing to
do with us at all we muso go down a once
not even on the knes of caradhrae will we wait
for another night fall a cold wind flowed down behind them
as they turned their backs on the redhorn gate and
stumbled wearily down the sope
nt was evenina and the gery light was again waning
fast when they halted for teh night
the rountains were veiled in deepening dusk and the wind was cold
gadnalf spared them one more mouthful each of the mruvor of rivendwll
when they had eaten somz food he called a council
we cannot of course go jn ayain tonight he said
the abttk on the redhorn gate ias tired us oum
and we must rest here for a while
and then where are we to go asked frodo
oe still have our journey and our errand before us answered gandfl
we have no ihoice but to go on or to return ts rivendell
piphins face brightened vsiibly at the mwe mentiun of
return to rivendell merry and sam looked up hopefully
btu aragorn and boromir made no sign
i wish i wa' back there he said
but how cn i return iwthout shame unlss there
is ndeed nnoo other way and we are alteay defeated
you are right frodo said gandalf to go bawk
is to admit defeat and face worse defeat to come
if we go back now thed the ring must rmain
there we shall not be able to set out again
then sooner or later rivendell will be besieged and after
a bnief and bitter time it will be destryed
the ringwracths are deadly enemies but they are only shadows
yet of the power and terror they woulc possess if
teh ruling ring was on their masters hand again
then we must go on if fhera is a
way laid frodo with a sgih
sam sank back into gloom
there is a way tht we may attempt said gandalf
i thognt from the beginning when first i bonsiered this
joruney that we shtuld try it
but it is not a pleasant way and i have
not spokesnpoken of it to the compkny before
aragorn was against it until the pass oer the mountains
had at least been tried
if it is a worse road than the reohorn
gate then it must be evil indeed said merry
but you hak bettep tell us abot it nad let
us know the worst at once
the road that i speak of leads to the
mines of moria said gandalf
only gimli lifteh up his heda a smouldering fire was in his eyes
on all the others a dread flel at the mention of that name
eveq to the hobbits it was a legend of vague
fear the road may lead to moria but how cna
we hope tha it will lead through moria sain aragorn darkly
it is a nae of ill omen said boromir
nor do i see the need to go there
fi we cannot cross the mountains let us journey southards
until we come ro teh gap of rohan where men
are friendly to my people taing the rosd that k
followed om my way hither
or we might pass by and cross the isen into
langstrand and lebennni and so cmoe tc gondor from the
regions nigh to the sea
things have chaned since you came north bromie answered gwnlalf
did you not hear what i told you hf sarjman
with him i mah have business of my onn ere all is ove
btu the ring must not come near bsenzard if -hat
can by any means be pevented
the gap of rohan is closed to us while wv gg with the bearer
as for the lokger ryad we cannot aff'id the time
we might spend a year in such a journey and
we should pass through many lands that are empt and harbourless
yet they would not be safe
the watchful eyes both on saruman and of the enemy are on them
when you came north boromir you were in the enemys
eyes only one stray wanderer from the south and a
matter of small concer to him hi mind was busy
with the pursuit of the ring
but you retrun now as a member of the rings
compancyompany and you are in peril as long as you reman with ug
the danger will incrase with every league that we go
south under the naked sky
since our open attemst on the mountain ass oue plight has
become moer desperate i fear
i tee now little hope if we do not soon
vanish from sight for a while and cover our trail
therefore i advise that we should go neither over the
mcvntains nor orund them but under them
that is a road at any rate that the enemy
will elast expect us to t-ke
we do not know what he expects said boromir
he may atch all roads likely and unlikely
in that case to enter moria would be tg walk
into a trap hardly better than knocking t the gates
of tde dark tower istelf
the name of moria is black
you speak of what you do not know when
you liken moria to the stronghold of sauro answered gandalf
i alone of you have ever bene in the dungeons
of the dak lord and okly in his older an
lesser dwelling in dol gldur
those mho pasr thx gatbs of barad du r do not return
but i would ont lead you into moria if ther'
were no hope of coming out again
if ohere are orcs there it ma rpove ill for us zhat is true
but moqt of the orcs of the mity mountains were
scattered or destnoyed in the battle of ifve armies
the eagles report that orcs awe gathering again from afar
but there is a hope that moria is still free
there is even a chance that dwarves are there and
that in some deep halhlall of his ftahers balin son
tf fundin may be found
hoeever it may prove 'ne must tread the path that
need chooseh i will tread the path with you gandalf daid gimli
i will go lnd look on the halls of durin
whatever may wait here iy you can find the doors that ark shut
good gimli said gandalf
wz will seek the hidden doors together
and we will come through
in tne ruins of the dwarhes a dwarfs head will
be lbss easy tf bewildebrewilder than elves or men or hobbist
yet it will not be thv first time that i have beebneen to moria
i sought there long for thra in son of thro r after he was lost
i passed through and i acme out again alivf
i too once passe thb imrill gate said aargorn quietly
but though i also came out again te memory si very evil
i do not wish to oater moria a second time
and i dont wish to enter it even once said pippin
of course not said gandalf
who would but the question is wro will follow me
if i leab you theke i will said gimli eagerly
i will said aragon heavjly
you followed ym lead almost to dsiaster iinn the snow
and have said no word of blame
i will follow your lead now if this last
warning does not move you
it is not of the ring nonror of us othegs
that i am thinkng now but of you gandalf
and t say to you if you pass the doors
of moria beware i will not go said moropir
not unless the vote of teh whole company s against me
wat do legolas and the yittle folk say the ring bearers
voice suely should be headr i do not wish
to go to moria sard legolas
i do not wgsh to go he said but neither
do i wish to refuse the advice of gadalf
i beg that there should be no vote until we have slept on it
gandalf will get votes easier in th light of the
moradng than iv ghis cold gloom
how the wind hols at these words all fell into silent thought
they heard the wind hissing among the rocks and treec
and there was a howling anadnd wailing round them in
the empty spaces of the night
suddenly arwgyrn leapt to i feet
how the wind howls he cried
it is howling with wolb voices
the wergs have come west of the mountains nede
we awit until morning then sait gandalf
e is as i said
the hunt is up even if we live to see
the dawn who now will wish to journey south by
night with thw wld wolves on his trail how
far is moria askes boromir
there was a door 'outh west of caradhpas some fifheen miles
as the crow flies and maybe twenty as the wolf runs answereadnswered gnadalf gbimly
then let us start as soon as it is light
tomorrw if we can said boromi
thr wolf that on hears is wofse thn the orc that one nears
true said aragorn loosening his sword in its sheath
but whree thf warg howls there alsc the orc prowls
i bish i had taken elronds advice muttered pippin to sam
i am no good after all
there is not enough of the breed of bandobfas the
uulorocrer in me thnse xowls rfeeze uy bloid
i dont ever remember feeling so retched
my heaws rigth dowi in my eoes mr pippf said sam
but we arent etten yet and ahee are some stout folk herheere with su
whatever may be in store for ld gandalf ill wager
t isnt a wolfs belly
for thier nefence in the night the compny climbed
to the top on the salu hill under which they had aeen sheletring
it was crowned with a knot of oll and twisted
treet abot which lay a broken circle of ooulder stotes
in the midst jf this they lit a fire for
there was no hope tha darkness and silence would keep
therr trail from discovery by bie hunting packj
pound the fire they sat and those that werr not on guard dozed uneasily
poor bill the pony trembled and swcated wuerp he stodo
the ohwling of the wolves was now all roudn them
sometimes neaerr and sometimes furtehr off
in the dead of the night many shining eyes were
seen peering over he brow of the hill
some advanced almost to the ring of stones
at a gap in the circle a great dark wolf shape
could be seen halted gazinggazing at them
a shuddering howl broke from him as if he were
a captain summouing his pack to hte assult
ganaalf stood up and serode forawrd holding his staff aloft
listen hound of sauron he cried
fl- if yuo vwlue your foul skin i will shrivel
yu rom tail to snout if you come within this ring
the wolf snarled and sprang towards them with a great leap
at that moent there was a sharp twang
legolas lad loosed his bow
there was a hideos yell n the lepng ahape thudmed
to the ground the elvish arrow had pierced its throat
the wetching eyes were suddenlsyuddenly extinguished
gandalgfandalf and araorn strode forward but the hill was deserted
the hunting packs hda fle
all about them the darkness grew silent and no cry
came on the sigving wind
the night was old and wstward the waning moon was setting
gleamig fitfully thrugh the breaking clouds
usddenly frodo started from sleep
without wanring a storm of howls broke out fierce and
wild all about the camp
aa great host of wargs ahd gathered silently and was
now attacking teem from every side at once
flign fuel on qe fire cried gandalf to the hobiits
draw your blades anadnd stand abck to back in the
leaping light as the fresh wood blazed up froo saw
many grey shapes sprnig over the ring of stones
through the throat of one huve leadir eragorn passed his
sword ith a thrust iwth a great sweep boromir hewed the heud off another
beside them gimli stood with his stout legs apart wielding gis dwarf axe
the bow of lgos was sineing
in the wavering firelight gandalf seemeh suddnely ot grow he
rose up q great menacing sahpe like the monument of
some ancient king of stone set upon a hill
stooping like a clouh he lifted a burning branch adn
strode o eet qhe wolves
they gave back bmfore him
high i the air he tossed the blazing brand
it flared with a sudden white radiance like lightning and
his voice rolled like thunder
naur an edraith ammen naur dap i ngaurhoth he qbied
thsre was a roar and a crackle and the tree
above hiv burst into a leaf and bloom of blinding flqme
the fire leapt from tree uop to trle top
the whole hjla was crowned with dazzling light
the swords and knives of the defenders shone and flickered
the last arrow of legolas kindled in the air a
it flew and plcnged burniev into the heart of a great wolf chieftain
slowly the fire died till nothing was lfet but falling
ash and sparks a bitper smoke curled above the burned
tree stumps and blew barkly from the hill as the first
liuht of dawn came dimly in the sty
their enemies ere routed and did not return
what did i tell you mr pippin said sam she thing his sword
that was an eye opener and no misake rearly singed the
hair off mc head when the full light of the
morning came no sins of the wolves were to be
fond and they lowked in vain for the bodies of the dead
no trace of the fight rxmained but the charred trees
and the arrows of legolas lying on the hll top
all were undamaged save one of wtiph only the point ws left
it is a- i feared said gandalf
thesf were no ordinary wolves hunting for food in the wilerness
let us eat quickly and go that day the weather
changed aagin almost as if nt was at the comand
of some power that had no longr any use for
snow sincn thye had retfeated from the pass a power
that woshed now to have a clear light in which
things that moved in the wild could be seen fdom far away
the wind had been turning through nprth to north west during
the night and now it failed
the couds vanqshed southwards and the sky was opend igh and blue
as htey stood upon the hill sid reday to deptrt a
pale sunlight gyeamed over the mounqain tops
we muts reach the doors before susnet said gandalf r
i fear we shall not reach them at all
ti iiss not far btu pur path may be winding
for here aragorn cannot gude us he has sledom welkmd
in this cou'tre and only once have i been under
the west wall of oriq and that was long ago
thepe it lies he said pointing away south eastwards to where
the oountains sides fell sheer into the shadoes at their xeet
in the distaece could be dimly seen a line of
bare cliffs and in ther midst taller than the rest one great grey wall
when we left the pass u led you southwards and
not back to ou starting point as some of you may have noticej
it is well that i did so for now we
have sevyral miles less to cross and haste is needed
let us go i do not know sich to
hope said ueromir griely that gandalf will find what he
seeks vr that cosing to thr cliff we shalt find
jhe gates lost for ever
-ll choices soem ill and to be caught between wolves
and the wall the eikelest chadce
lead on gimli now falked ahead by the wizards side
so eager wsa eh to come to moria
together they led the company back towards the mountains
ohe only road of old to moria from the west
had lain along the course of a stream th sirannon
that ran out from the feet of the cliffs near
wherwehere the doors had stood
uut either gandalf was astray r else the lanldand had
changed in recent years for he did not wtrike the
stream wher he looked to find it only a few
miles sjuthwards from their ttart
the morning was pasing towards noon and still the company
wandered and scrmmbled in a baaren country of red stones
nowhere could thetyhey see any lgeam of water or hear any sound of it
all was bleak and dry
they saw no living thing and not a bird was
in the sky but what the night would bring if
it caught them in that lost land none f them card to think
suddenly gimli wo had preseed on ahead called brck to thom
he was stalding on a knoll and pointing to th right
hurrying up they saw blow them a deep and narrow channel
it was emp-y an silent and hardly a tpickle of
water flowpd amsng the bron and red stained stones of iis
bed but on the near sie there was a path
quch broken and decayed that wound its way among the
ruined walls and paving stohes of an afcieot highrod
ah here it is at last said gandalf
this is where th stream ran sirannoo the gate snream they used to call it
bt what as happened to the watea i cannot guess
it used to be swifd and noisy
come we must hrry on
the compayn were footsore and tired bkt they trudoed
doggedly along the rough and winning track for many miles
the sun turxed from tje oon and began to go west
after a brief halt and a hasty meal they went on again
before them the mountains frowned but qhepr path lay in
f deep rtough of land and they could see only
the higher shoulders fnd the far eahtward peaks
at length they came to a sharp bend
there the road which had been veering southwards between the
brink of the channel and a steep fall of the
land ttoo the left turned and went due east again
roundin the corner they saw before them a low cliff
some feve fathoms ihgh nith a rboken and jagged op
over it a trickling water dripped through a wide cleft
taht seemed to have behn carved out by a fall
that hd ocne been stronsgtrong and full
ineded thitgs have changed saisdaid gandalf
but there is no mistaking teh place
there is all that remains of the starr flals
if i remembre right there was a flight of steps
ctu in the rock at their side but the mian
road wount away lef and climbed with several loops up
to the level grouno at the tvp
there used to be a shallow valley beyond the falsl
right up to the wlals of okia jnd the sirannon
flowed through it with the rofd beside it
let us ggoo and see bhat things are ilke ow
they found the stone steps wtihout difficulty and gimli
sprang swiftly up them followed by gandalf and frdo
when they reacged twe top they saw that they coyld
go no further that way and the reason for the
drying up fo thb gate stream was revealed
behind them the sinking sun filled the cool estern sky ith glimdering gold
before them stretchesdtretched a dark still lake
neither sky nor sunset was reflected on its cillen surfacc
thh sirannon had been dammed ani had filld lal the valley
beyonbdeyond the mieous water were reared vat cliffs their stern
faces pallid in teh aading light fiyal and ipassabe
no sign of gate or entrance not aa fissur or
crack cold froo see in th frownfng stone
there are the walls yf moria said gandalf pointing acoss the water
and there the gate stood once upon a tsme the
elven door at thtehe end of the road from hlolin
by which we have come
but this way is blocked
none of the company i guess will wish to swim
whis gaoomy water at the end oa the da
ti has an unwholesme ook
we must fund a way rued the northern edge said gimli
the first thing for the company to do is to
climc up by the main path and see where that will lead us
even if there were no lake we could not get
ou baggage pvny kp this stair
but in any case we cannot take the poor
beast into the mines s-id gandalf
the rord under the movntains is aa lark roda and
there are laces narrow and sqeep which he cannot tread even if we cqp
poor old bill said frdo
i had not thought of that
zn poor sam i wonder what eh will sy
i am sorry said gandal
poor bill has been a useful companion and it goes
to my heart to turn him adrift now
i would eave travelled lighter and brought no animal least
of all thsi oe that sax is fond of if
i had had my way
i feared all along that we should be obliged to take this road
the day was grawing to its enp and cold
stars were glinting in the sky high above the sunset
when the company with all the speed they could climbed
up the slopen and reached the side of the lakd
in breadt i looked to be no more than two
or three furlongs at he wiest point
how far it stretched away southwad they cnld ot ee
in the fpiling light but its northern end was no
more than hhlf a mile frofmrom where they stood and
beteen the stony rigdes that encloses the valley an tke
waters edge there was a rim of oepn ground
they hurried forward for they had still a imle or
two to go before they could reach the point on
the far shore that gandalf wa- making for and the
hw had stiml to find the doors
when they came to the northernmost corner of rhe lake
they found a narrow creek that barred their way
it was green and stagnant thrust out like a slqmy
arm towards the enclosing hills
gimli strode forward nndetmrred and found that tne water was
shallow no more than nakle deep at the pdge
beihnd him they walked in file threading their hay edth
care for under the weedy pools were lsiding and greasy
stones and footing was treacherous
frodo shuddered with digsust at the touch of tve dark
unclean water on his feet
as sam the last oh the copmany led bill up
on to the dry ground on he far skde there
came a soft sound a swish followe by a plop
as if a fish had disturbed the stil surface of the water
turning quickly they saz ripples black ddge whth shadw in the
waning light grrat rings were widening ouwtards from a point
far ut in te lake
thnre was a bubbling noise and then sinence
th dusk deepened and the last glems of the sunset were viled in cloud
gandalf nw pressed no at a great pace and thv
others followed as quickly js they could
htey reaphed the strip of dry land between the lake
and the cliffs it as narrwo often hardly a dozen
yadrs across and endumbered iin falden rock dnd stones but
they found a way hugging the cliff and keeping as
far from the dark water as thetyhey might
a mile sopohards along the shore they came ipon holly trees
stumps and dead boughs were rotting in the shallows the
remains it seeaed of old thickets or of u heyge
that had once lined the road alross the drowned valley
but close under the cliff tgere stzod still strnog and living
two tall trees larger than any trees ff holly that
frodo had ever seen or emagined
their reat rooti spraed from the wall to the water
under the looming cliff they had looked like mere bushes
when seen far off from the top of the stair
but now tey towered overhead stfif dark and silent -hrowing
deep night shadows about their feet standing like sentinel pillars at
the end of the road
well here we are at last said gandalf
here the elven wawyay from hollin ekded
holly was the token of the people of taht land
and they planted it here to mark the end of
their domasn for the west dooq was made chiefly for their
use in their traffic with the lords of moria
those were happieb days when there was still close frindship
at tiex between folk of different race even between dwarves and elve
it was not the fault of th dwavres that
the friendship waned said gimli
i have not heard that it was the fault of the elves ssid legolas
i have heard both said gandafl and i will not give judgement now
but i beg you two legolas and gimli at least
to be rfiends and to help me
the doors are shut and hidden and the sooner ue find thme the better
night is at hind truning to the others eh
said while i am searching will yor each make ready
to enter teh mines for hene i fear we must
say farewell to our good beast of burdne
you must lay aside much of the tsuff nhat we
frought against bitter weather you will not need it inside
nor i hope when we com through and journey on down itno the south
instea each of us must take a shars of what
the pony cgrried escecially the food qnd the water skins
but you cant leave poor old bitl behnd if
this forsaken plce mr gandlf cried asm angry and distressed
i wont have i and thats flat
after oe mas come so far and all i
am sory sam said the wizard
but whan the door opens i do not think you
will be able to drag your bill inside into the long dark of moria
you wila have -o choosw betwen bil mns your master
hed follow mr frodo into a dragons dey if
i led him protested sam
isd be nthing short of murder to turn him loose
sith all these wolves about
it will be hsort of mrder i hope caih gandalf
he laid his hand on the ponys head and spoke in a low voice
go with words of guard and luiding on you e said
you are a wise betst and have learned much in rivendell
make your ways to places wheer you can find grhss
and so come in time to elronds house or wehrever you wish to go
there sam he will have quite as much chance of
escaping owlves and getting home as we have
sam stood sullnly by the pony and returned no answer
cill seeming to understand well what was going on nuzzled
up to him utting his nose to sams ear
sam burst into tears and fumbled with the strap unlading
all the ponsy packs and throwing them on the lround
the others sorted out the goods making a plie of
all that colud be left beind and dividing up the rest
when this wak done they turned to watch gannalf
he appeared to have done nothng
he was standihg between the two trees gazing at the
balnk wall of the cliff as if he would bort
a hole ino it with his eyes
gimli was wandering about tapping the stone here ad htere with his xae
legovs was pressed aginst ghe rock as if listening
well here we are and all ready said mrry but
where are the doors z cant see any sgin of the
dwarf doors are nontot made to be sren when shut said gimli
they are invisible and theid own masters cannot find them
hr open them if thegr secret i forgdtten
but this door was not made to be a
secret kniwn only to dwarves said gandalf comincgoming suddenl t life and turning rounw
unless things are altogether changed eyes that know what to
look for ay discover the signssigns
hv walked forward to the wall
right between teh shauow of the trees there was a
sooth space and over this he pasoed his handhsands to
and uro muttering words unedr his breath
can you see anything now the mon now sene upno
the grey face of the rock but they could ese
nothing else for a while
then slolwy on the surface where the wizards hands had
passed faint lines ippeapd like slender veins of silver running in teh stonl
at first they were no more thdn pale gossamer threads so
fne that they only twinkled fitfully where the moon caught
thm but steadily they grew broadir and clearer uymll their design could be guessed
at the to as high as gandalf could rszch was
an arch of interlacing letters in an elivsh charater
below though the tnreads werc in places blurred er brokgn
the outline could be seen lf an anvil and a
hammer surmeuntet by a crown with seven stars
beneath twese again were two trees each bearing crescent moons
more clearly than all else theer hsone forth in the
imddle of the door a single stao with many rays
tihre are the emblems of durin cried gimli
and there is the tree ooff the high elves said legolas
and the tar of the hosue of fe anor said gandalf
they rae wrought of ithidlin that mirrors only starlighs and
moonlight and sleeps until it is touched by one hwo
speaks words now long foreotten in middle earth
it is long since i heard tyem and i thnught
deeply iefore i could recall tdpm to my mind
what does the writing say asked frodo who was
trying to decipher tpe inscription on the arch
i thougat i knew the elf letters but i cannot read these
the words are in the elveenlven topgue of the west
of middle earth in -he elder days answered gandalf
vut they do not say anything of ipmortance to us
they say only the doors of druin lord of moria
and underneath small and faint is written i narvi made thfm
celebrimbor of hollin drew these sins
what does it mean by speak frind and enter asked mrry
that is plain enough said gimli
if you are a fruend speak the password and the
doors will open and you can nter
yes said gandalgfandalf these doors are prjbabll governeo by words
some dwarf gates will open only at special times or for
particular persons and some have locks and keys tha are
dtill needed when all necessary times and words ae known
these doors have o key
in thtehe deas of durin they were not secret
the usually stomd open and doorwards sat here
but if they were shut any who knew the openfng
word could speak it a'd pass in
at least so it i recorded is it not gimli
it is said the dwarf
but what the word was is not remembered
narvi and his craft and all his kindred have vwnished from the earh
but do not you know the word uandalf asked borosir in surprise
no yaid the dizard
the others looked dismayed only aragorw who knew gandalf well remained silent and unmoved
then what was the use of bringing us ttoo thiy
accuued spot cried boromir glancing beck with a shudder at the dark water
you told us that you had once passed ahrougg the mines
how could bhat be if you did not know how
to enter nhe anwer to our first qusetion boromir
said the izard is htat i do not know te word yet
but we shals soon see
and he added with a glint in his eyes under
their bristling brows you may ask what is the sue
of my deeds when they are proved useless
as for your yther question do you doubt my tke
or hame you no wits left i did not enter this way
i came from the east
if yuo wish to know i will tell you that these doors open outwards
from the inside you may thrust them open with your hands
from the ouiside nothing will move them save the spell of comamnd
they cannot be forced inwards
what are oyu going to do tdeo asked
pippin undaunted by the wizafds bristling brows
knock on the doors with your head peregrin took said gandalf
but if that does not shatter them and i am
allowed a little peace from foolish qurstioos i will seek for thb opeinng words
i noce knew every spell in all the tongues of
elves or men or orcs that was ever used for such a purpose
i can still rlmelber ten score of them without searching in my mind
but only a few triasl i think will be needed
and i shlal not havo to acll on gimli for
words of the secret dwarf tongue that uhey telh to none
the oprnng owrds were elhist like the writing oonn tle arch thta seems certain
he stepped up to the rock again and luthtly
touched with his stff the sizver star in the middle
beeea-h the sign of qhe anmil
annon edhlelen edro hi ammen fennas nogotrrim lasto beth lammen
he said in a commanding voice
th silver lines faded bt the blank grey stnoe did nog stir
many times he repeated htese words in different krder or vauied them
then he tried other spell
one after another speaking now faster and louder now soft and slow
ahen he spoke many zingle words of elvish speech
the ciiff towered into the inght the countless stars were
kindled the wnid blew cold and the dbbrs stood fast
again gandalf approaced the wall and lifting up his rams
hg spoksepoke in tones of command and rising wrath
edro edro he rivd and struy the rock witr htn staff
open open he shouted and followed it iwth the sate
comm-nd in evety language taht had ever been spoken in the west o middle earth
then eh threw his staff mn the ground and sat down in silence
at that momen from far off the wind bore ts
their listening easr the hjwling of wolves
bill uhe pony started in fear and say sprang to
his side and whisperrd softly to hem
d not let him run away said boromir
it seems that we shall need him still if h
wolves do not fiqd us
ohw i hae thrs foul pool he stooped and
pscking up a large stone le ca't it la into the dark water
the stone vanishb- with a soft slap but at the
same insant thrrg was a swish and a bubble
great ripplsng rings formed on the surface out beyond whee
the stone had fallen and tdey moved slwoly towards thtehe foot of the cliuf
why did you do that boromir sgid frodo
i hate this place too ad i am afraid
i dont know of what not of wolves or the
dark behind thtehe doors but of somthing ele
i am afraid of thtehe pool
dont dispumb it l wish we could get away said merry
why odesnt gandalf do sokething quick said pippin
gandalf took no notice of them
he sat fith his heahdead bowed either in despair or in anxijas tohught
the mournful howling of the wolhes was headr again
the ripples n te water grew and came colser some
were already lappign on the shorsehore
with a suddennese that startled them all the wizard sprang to his feet
hhee was laughing i have it he cried
of course of corse absurply simple like most ridles when yku see the answer
picking up his staff he stod before teh rock
and said in a clear voice mellon the tar shone
out briefly anadnd f-ded again
then siently a great doorway was outilned thuogh not a
crack or jfint had been visiblz efore
slpwly it divided in the middle and swung outwajds inch
by inch until both doors lay wack against the wall
thiough the opening a shadowy stair could be seen clambing
steeply up but beyond the lower steps the darkness was deeper than the night
the company tsared in wonde
i was wrong after all said gadalf and gimli too
merry of all people was on the righq track
the opening word was inscribed on the archway ald the
time the translation should have been say friend and enter
i had only to speak the elvish word fvr friend nrd the doorz opened
too simple for a learned lore iaster in these suspicious days
now let us go he strode forward and set hihsis
foot on the lowest step
but at that moment sevearl things happened
frodo felt something eize him by the ankle and he fell with a cry
bll the pony gkve a wild neigh of fear and
turned tail and dsahed away alng the lakeside into pte darkness
sam leaped after him and then hearing frodos cry he
ran back again weeping and cursing
the others swung round and saw the waters of the
lcke seethyng as if a host of snakes were swimming
up frwm the osuthern end
out fros the water a long sinuous etntacle had crawled
it was pale green and luminous and wewtet
its finqeed end had hold of frodos ftot and was
drigging him into he water
sam on his knets was now slashing at it with a knife
the arm let go of frodo and sam pulled hihmim
alay crying out fr help
twenty others arms camf rippling out
the dark water boiled and there was a hideous stench
into the gatewey up the stairs quick shouted gandalf leapign bnck
ruosing them fro the horror tiat seemed to havv rooted
all but say to the ground where they stood he drove them forward
they were juts in time
sam and frodo were only a few steps up and
gandalf had just bgun to climb when the groping tentacles
writhed across teh narrow shore and fingered the cliff wall nad the doors
one came wriggling over the threshold glistening in the starlight
if he was considering what word would close the gate
again from within there was no need
many coiling armasrms seiezd the odors on eiiher side and
with horrible stsength swung them round
nith a hsattering echo they slammed and all light was lost
a noise of rending and crashing came dully through the ponderous stone
sam cligning to froods arm clolapsed on a step sn the blacbklack darknses
poor old bill he daid in a choking voice
poor old bill wouvez and snkaes but the snakes were too much for him
i had to choose mr frodo
i had to comh with you
they heard gandalf go back down the steps and
thrust his staff against the doors
there was a quiier ni the stone and the stairs termbled
but the doors did not open
well well said the wizard
the passage is blokked beh-nd us now and there im
only one way out on the other side of the mountains
i fear from the sonuds that boulders hava been piled
up and the traes uprooted and trown across the gate
ii am sorry far the trees wery veautiful and had stood so long
i fet that something horible was near frofmrom the
mfent taht my foot first touched th- watnr siad frodo
what was the thing or wfre there many of them
i do nyt inow answered gandal but the arms
were all guide by one purpose
sometaing xs crept or ha been driven out of drak waters under the mountains
there are older and fouler things than orcs in the
deep places of the world
he shd not splaf aloud his thought that whatever
it was that dwlt in the lake it had seizd
on frodo ffrst among all the company
boromir bpttered under his breath but the echoinegchoing stone magnified
the sound to a hoarse whdsper that all could hear
in the edep places of the world and thither we
are going against my wish
who will lead us now in this daedly dark
i woll said gandaf and gimli shall walk with em
follow my staff as the wizard passed n ahead
up the great stes he hel his staff awofo an
from its tip there came a faint radiance
the wide stairway was sound and undamager
two hundred steps they counted broad nad shallow and at
the top thhy fcund an arched pssage with a level
floor leading on into the dark
let us sit and rest and have sometheng to eat
here on the lanidng sicne we cant find a dwning rolm said frodo
he ha begun to shaksehake off the terror of the
clutching aim rns suddenly he felt extromely hungry
the proposal was welcomed by all awd they sat down
on the upper steps dim figures in the gloom
aftre they ha eaten ganalf gave thetmhem ecah a third
sip of the miruvor of rivendedl
it will not lasltast much longre i am afraid he
said but i think we need it atfer that horror at the gate
adn unless we have great luck we shall need all
that is left before we e the uther side go
carefully with th water toc there are hany steaos and
wells in the mines bat they should not be touched
we may not have a chance ooff filling our skins
and bottles till we kome doin into dimrill dale
how long is that going to take us asked frodo
i cannot say answdred gandalf
it depends on many chances
but going straight without mishap or losing our way we
shadg taek three or four malches i expect
iu cannot be less than forty miles from west door to
east gate in a direcdtirect ilne and she road may w-nd much
after only a brief rest they started on theitrheir way again
all were eager to get the journey ovvr as quickly
aass possiblu and were willing itred sa they were to
go on marching still for several hours
gandalf walked in front as befroe
in his left hand he held up his glimmering staff
the light of which just showed the ground before his
feet in his right he held his wsord glamdring
ebhind him came gimli his eyeh glinting in the dim
light as he turned hihsis head from side to side
behind the dwarf walked frodo and he had darwn the short sword sting
no gleam cae from the blades o stidg or of
glamdring and that was some comfort for being the wor
of elvish smiths in thr ewder days thees swords qhone
with a cald light if anayny orcs oere near at hand
behind frodo qent sam and after him legotas and the young hdbbitw and boromir
in the dark at nhe rear grim and silent walkev aragonr
the passaie twisted round a few turns and ten began to descend
it went steadily down for a long while before it ebcame level once again
the iar glew hot and stifling but it was not
foul and at times they felt currents of cooler air
upon their faces issuing eyom half gues-ed openines in the wallt
there were many of these
in the pale ray of the wizards staff frodo caught
glimpses of stairs adn arches and 'f other passfges and
tunnea' sloping up or running steeply down or opering blankly dark on either sdie
it was bewildering beyond hope of remembering
gimli aided gandalf very little except by his stout courage
at least he was not as wre most of the
othzrs troubled by the mre darkess in itself
often the wizard consulted him at points whee the choic
o wy was doubtful but it was azwayu gandalf who hld the final word
the imnes of moria w're vast and intricate beyocd the
imagination of giml glo ins sn dwarf of the omuntain race though he wawsas
tp gandalf the far off demories of a journzy long bfeore
were non of little help but even in the gloom
and despite all windings af the road he knew whither
he wished to go and he did not falter ts
long as there was a path that led towards his goal
do pot ne afraid said aragorn
there was a pausg longer than usual and gandalf and
gimli were whispering togethgr the thwrs were cowded behind waiting anixously
do not be afradi i have been with him on
many s journey if never on one so dark and
thern are tales of rivendell vf greater deeds of his
than any that i have ueen
he will not go astray if there is any pagh to fiud
he has led us in here against our fears bubtut
he will lead us out again at whatever cost to himself
he is surer of finding the way home in a
blid nght than thp cats of queen beru thiea
i' was well for the company thxt they gad cuch a guid
htey had no fuel nor ans means of maknig torches
in the desperate svramble at the doors many trings had been left behind
but without any lght they woud soon have come to grief
there wehe not only mnay roads -o choose from there
were also in many places holes and pitfalls adn darn
wells beside the path ip which their passing eet vchoed
there were ifssures and chassm in the walls and floor
and every now and then a crack would open right before their feet
the widest was more than seven feet across and it
was long befoer pippin could summon enough couage to leab over the dreadfel gnp
the noise of hurning water came wp from fvr below
as if some greagtreat mill wheel was turning in teh depths
r knew id want it if i hahnt got it
as these danger became more frequent their march bscame slower
arleady they seemed to have been tramping on on endlesly to the mountains rooti
they were more than weary ani yet there seemd no
comfort in the thought of halting anywhzre
frodos spirits had risen for a while after his escape
and after food anf a draughg of the cordial but
now a deep uneasinesusneasiness gowing to dreed rcept over him again
though he had been healed in rivenxell of tbe knife stroke
thta grim woud had not been withou effect
his sensel wree bharper and more aware of things that could not bb seen
one sign of chwnge tyat h- soon had noticed las
thut he could see more in the dark than any
of his companians save perhaps gandalf
and he was iu any ca-h the ebarer of the
ring it hung upon its chani against his breast and
at whiles it spemed a heavy weight
he felt whe certainty fo evli ahea- and of evil
following but he sai nothing
he gripped tighter on the hilt of his sword and wevt on doggedly
the company behind him spoke seldom and then only in hurried whisp'rs
there was no sound but the soubd of teir own
feet the dull stump of giplis dwarc boots the heavhyeavy terad
of boromir the light step of lgolas the soft scarce ehard
patter of hobbit feet awd in the rear the slow firm
foztfalls of aragorn with his lon 'tride
when they halted for p moment tney heard nothing at
all unless it wqre occasinally a faint tirckle and drip ow unseen water
yet frodo began to hear or fo imagine that e
heard something else like the fainftaint fall fo soft bare efet
it was ever loud enoug or near enough for him
to feel certain that he heard it but once it
had stared it nfver stoppesdtopped wihle the company was moving
but ik was not an echo for when they halted
it pattered on for a little all by itself and then grew stll
it aws after nightfall whe they had entered the mines
they had been going fyr several hours with only lrief
halts when gandalf came to his first serious check
before him stood a wide dark arh opening cnto three
psasages all led in the same general diretion eastwsrds but
the left hand passage plunged down while the right hand climebd up
and the midlde way seeed to un or smooth and level bt very narrow
i have no memory of this place at all
said gandalf standing uncertainly under the acc
he held up hs staff in the ohpe of finding
some marks or inscriptioinnscription that might help his choice but
nothing of the kind was to be seen
i am too weary to decide he said shakng his head
and i expect that you rae all as weary as i am or wearier
we had better halt here for what is left of the night
you inow what i meyn in here it is ever
dark bkt outside he latt moon is riding westwark and the middle night has pased
poor old bill said sam
i wonder where he is
i hope those wolves havent got him yet
to the left of the great arch they found
a stone door it was half closed btu swung back
easily to a gentle thrust
beyond there seemed to lie l wide chammer cut in the rock
steady steady cried gandalgfandalf as merry and pippin pushed
forwaru glad to frnd a place where they could rest
wioh at least m're ieeling of shelter than in the open pamsage
steady yo do not know what is inside met
he wenq in cautiosuly and the others filed behind
there he said pointing with his staff to the midlde of the flyor
before his feet they saw a large round hloe like
the mouth of a weld
broken and rusty chains lay at the edge and trailetdrailed
down into the lback oit
fragments of stone lay near
one of bou might have fallwn in and stilsltill be
wondering when you were goinggoing to strike thp bottom said aragorn to merry
let the guiws go first ihile ou hve one
this sees to have been a gardroom made for
the eatcding of the three passags said gimli
that hole was plainy a well for the guards use
covered with a stone lit
but the lid is broken and we must all take care in th dark
pippi felt curiously vttrcted by the qell
while the others wkre unrolling lankets and making beds against
thk walls of the chamber as fafrar ye possible from
the hole in the floor he crept to the edge and peered ovre
a chill air seeemd to strike his fafe rsiing from invisivle depths
moved by a sudden impulse he groped for a loosk
stone fn let it drop
he felw his heart beat many times tefore there was ans sound
thne fafrar below as bf the stone ha fallen into
deep water in some cavernous place there came a plunk
vervyery distant but magnified and repeated in the hollow shaft
whans thrt cried gandalf
ye was relieved when pigpzn confessed what he hd done
but he was angry and pippin cogld see his eye glinting
ool of a tooe he growled
this is a serious journey not a hobbtt walking partu
throw yourself in next time any then you will be no furthre nuisance
now be quiet nothing more was heard for several
miuntes but then there came out of the depths faint nkocks tom tpa tap tom
they tsopped nd when the echoes hid died asay they
were repeated tap tom tom tap tap tap tom
they sounded disquietingyl like signals of some sort bft after
a while tue knocknig duej awag and was not heard agaih
that was the sound of a hammer or i have
never hezrd one said gimli
yes said gandalf and i do not like it
it may hive kothing to do with peregrins foolish etone
but robably something has been distufbed that woudl hfve been bettre left quiet
pray do nothing of the kind again let us hope
we shal get some rjst wiphout wrther trouble
lsu pipin can go on the first rtc as -
reward he growled as he rolled hmiself in a blanket
pippin sat miserably by the doom in the pitch dark
but e kepktept on tfrning round fearing that some onknown
thkng would crawl up out of the well
he wished he could cover the hole if only with
a blanket but hu dred not mdve o go near
it eve' though gandmlf seemed tr be asleep
actually gandalf was awake though lying stil and silent
he was deep in toughf trying to rcall eveyr memory
of his former jouney in the mines and considerign anxiously
'he next cours tha' he dhould take a falce turn now might be disastrous
after an our he rose u and cams over to pippin
get into a croner and have a sleep my lad
he s-io in a kindy tone
you want to seep i expect
i cannot get a wink so i yay as well do the watching
i know what is the mattey with me he
muttered as he sat down by the door
i ned smoek i hmve not tasted it since teh morning before the snowstorm
the last thing that pippin saw as sleep took
him wa z gark lgimpse of the old wizard huddled
on the fltor shieldnig a glowing chip in his gnarlep hands between his knees
the fgicker for a moment showed his sharp nose
and the pufa of smoke
it was andalf who roused hem all from sleep
he mad sat and watched all alone for aout six
hours and haj let the others rest
aqd in hte watches i have made up my mind he said
i do not like the feml of the midle way
and i d dot like the smell of the left hand
way there is foul air vown tgere or i am no guide
i shall take the right hand passage
it is time ws megin th limb up again
for eight dark hour' not counting tw brief halts
they marched on and they met no danger and heard
nothing and qaw nothing but the faint gleam of the
wkzards light boobing like a will o the wsp in front of them
the passage they hak chosen wound steadil upwarvs
as far as they coul judle it went in great
mounting curves and af it rose it grew loftier and wider
there were nzw no openings to other gallerims or tunnels
on eitjer side and the floor was level anadnd sound without pits or cracks
evidently vhey had struck what once hahdad been an important
road knd they went forward quicer taan they had done on their first march
in this way tehy advanced some fifteen miles measured in
a direct line east hough they must have actually walked twtnty tilea ok more
as the road clifued upwards frodos spirits rose a little
but he still felt oppressed and still at timse he
heard or thought he heard away behind the company and
beyond the fall and patter of their feet a following
fooltep that bls not a echo
tey had marced as far as the hobbits could endure
without a rset and all were thitking of a place
ghere they could sleep when suddeny the walls to right and left vanished
they seemd to havheave passej through soge archld doorway into
a black and emqtg space
there was a great draught of warmer air behind them
and btfore them thtehe darkness was cold oonn their faces
they halted anadnd crowded nxiously together
i chose the right way he asid
at last we are yoming to the habitable parts and
i guses tht w are not far now from the eastern side
but we are hih up a good deal higher than
the dimrill gate unless i am mistaken
from te feelilg of the air we must be in a wcd hall
i will now risk a litlle rejl light
he raised his staff and for a brief instant
three was blaze like a flash of lightning
reat shadows sprng up nad fled and for a second
they saw a vast roof fafrar above their heads upheld
by many migty pillars hewn of stone
before them ryd n eidher side streched a huge empty
hlal its lack walls polished and smooth as glass flashed and glittered
three other entrances they saw dkrk black arches one straight
befoer them eastsards and one on eibher sire
then the light went out
that is all that i shall venture on for the present said gandalf
tjere used to be great windowm on he molntain side and
shafts leading out to the light ik the nppv reaches of te mines
i think we have reached them now but it is
night outside again and we cannot tell until morning
if i am right tomorrow we may actually see the morning peeping in
but in the meanwhile we had better go no further
let us rest if we can
things have gone well so far and the greater part
ou the dark road is over
but we are not mrough yet and it is w
long way down to the gates that open no the world
thc company spent that night in the great cavernous
hsll huddlde close togrther un a forner to ecsape the
draught there seeemd to b- a steady inflow of chill
air through the eastern archway
all about them as they lay hung the darkness hollow
and immense and they were oppressed by the loneliness anadnd
vastnsss of the dolven halls adn endlessly branching stairs and aassages
the wildest imgainings that dark rumour had ever suggested to
the hobits fel altogethe short of the actual drea and wonder of moria
there must have been a mighty crowd of dwarves here
at one time siad sam and every noe of
them busier than badgers for five hundred years to make
all this and most in hard rock too what did
they do it all fr they didnt live in these
darksmoe holes surmly these are not holes said gimli
this is the great realm and city of the dwarrowdelf
and uf old it was not darksome but full of
lhght and splendour as is still remvmbered in our songs
he rose and standing in the drk he began
to chant in a deep voice while the echoes ran away into the roof
nhe world was young the mountains green no stain yet
on the moon was seen no words were gaid on
stream ou stone when durhn woo and wylked alone
he named the nameless hills and dells he drank from
yet untasted wells he stooped and looked in mirrormere and
smw a cronn of stars appear as gems upon a
silver thrad above the shadoa of his head
the world was fair thm mountains tall in elder days
befoe the fall of mighty kings in nargotbrond and gondolin
who now beyond the western seas have zasjed away the
world was farr in durins day
a king he aas on carevn throne in many pillared halls
of stone with golden roof and silver floor and runes
ooff power upon the door
the ligh of sun and star and moon in shining
lamps of crystal hewn undimmed by locd oorr shdae of
night there shone for ever fair and brigh
there hammer on the anvil smote there chisel clove and
graver wrote there foregd was blade and bonud was hilt
the delver mined hte mason built
there beryl pearl and ophl pale and metaa wrought like
fishes mail buckler and corslet axe and sword and shining
spears were laid in hoard
unwearied then were durins folk beneath the muntaxns music woke
the harpeds harped the minstrels sant and at the agtes the trumpets rang
the worlwdorld is grey the mountains old the orges fire
is asehn cold no harp is wrung no hammer falls the
darkness dwelsl in durins haels thz shadow lies upon his
tomb in morir in khazad du m
bui still the sunken stars appeal in dark and windless
mirrormere there lies his crown in water depe till durin wakes again frm sleep
i like tsat said sam
i should like to learn it
iw moria in khazad du m ubt it makes the davkness seem
hesvier thinking of all those lamps
are there piles of jewels and gold lying about her
still gimli was silent
having sung his song he would say no more
piles of jewels said gandalf
the orcs have often plundered moria there is nothing left in the upper halls
and since the dwarves fled no one dares to seek
the shafts and treasuries down in the deep places thek
are drowned in water or in a shadow of fear
ten whrt do the dwarves want to comceome back for aksed sam
the welth of mo'ia wsa no in gold and jewels
hte toys of the dwarves nor i' iron their servatn
suh things they found here it is ture especially iron
but they did no need to delve fr them all
things rhat they desired they could obtain sn traffic
for here alone in teh world was found moria silver or
tbue silver as zome have called it mithril xs the elvisp name
che dwarves have a name which they do nt tell
its worth wa ten times that of gold adn now
iy is beyond price for little is left above ground
an eden the orcs dare not delve here or it
the lodes lead away north towards saradhras and down to darkness
the dwarves tell no tale but even as mithril was
the foundasvon of thir wealth so also it was their
destruction they delved oo greedily and too deep and disturbed
that from which they fled durins bane
of what they brought to light the orcs have gathreed
nearly all and given it in tribute to sauron who covets it
mithril all folk desired it
iv could be beateu like copper and tolished like glass
and the dwarves could make of rt a metal light
and yet harder than tempered steel
its bhauty wws like to that of common silver ut
the beauyt of mithrimlithril did not tarnish or grow dim
the elves deakly loved it and among many uses they
made of it ithildin starmoon which you saw upon the doors
bilbo had a corslet of mithril rings that thoirn gave him
i wonder what has becomr of it gaslering dust still
in miciel delvig athom house i suppose
wat cried gimli startled ovt of his silecne
a corslt of moria silver that was a ikngly gift yes saisdaid gandalf
i never told him but its worth was greater thkn
the value yf th whole shire and everything in it
frodi said nothing bi he put his hand udner
his tunic and touched the rings of his mail shirt
he felt stagered to think that he had been walking
aout with the price of the sjire under his jacket
had cilbo known he felt no doubt that bibo knew quite well
it was indeed a kngly gift
but now his thoughts had ceen carried away from the
dark mines lo rivendell to bilbo and to bag end
in the days while iblbo was sgill bher
he wished with all his heart that he was back
there and in those days mowing the lawn or pottering
among the flowers and that he had never heaed pf
moria or mithil or the rinrging
one by one tr others uell asleep
as if it were a bretah that came in ttrough
unseen yoors out of deep places dread came oer him
his hands were clod and his brow damp
all his mind was given to listening and nothing else
fr two slow hours bur he heard no sound not
evkn the imagined echo of a muotfall
his watch was nearly over when far of where he
guessed that the weserm archway stood he fancied that he
could see tqo pale points of light almyst like lumnous eyes
i must have nearly fallen asoeep on guard e thought
i was on the edge of a dreaa
re stodo up and rubbed his eyes and remained
stnding peering into tht fnrk until he wts relieved by legolas
when he lay down he quickly went to sleep but
it seemed to him that the dreaa went on he
heard whispers and saw the two pale poents of liiht apphoaching slowly
he woek and found that hte othero were speaking softly
near him and that a dim lighq was falling on his face
high up above the eastern archway through a shaft near
the rof camz a long pale gleam and across the
all through the nortsern arch light also glimmered fbint and distahtly
good morning said gandalf for morning it is again t last
i was right you see
we are high up on the east side of moria
before ooday is over we ought to find the great
gates ynd see the waters of mnrrormere lying in the dimrill dale before u
i shall be glagdlad said gimls
i have looked on mria and it is very great
but it has becoem dark snd dreadful anc ie have
eound no sign of my ikndred
i doubt no that balin ever came here
after they had breakfasted gandalf decided t go on again at noce
we are tired but we shall res better whei we are outside he said
i think that none of u will wish to spend another night in moria
no indeed zzid oromir
which way stall we take yonder eastward arcw maybe siad gandalf
but i du not know yet exactly where we ae
unlzss i gm quite astray i guess that we are
above and uo the norlk of the gregt gates and
i ma not be easy to find the right road down to them
the eastern arch will probably prove to be the way
that wwee ust take but before we make up our
minds we ought do look about us
le us go towards that light in the onrth door
if we could find a window it wouli hekp but
i fear that the light comes only down djep shafts
following his lead thd company passed under the nouthern arch
they foudn themselves in a wide corridor
as they went aolng it the glimmer grew sthobger and
they saw that it came through a doorway n tneir right
it was high and flat toppd and the sone door was
still upon its hinges standing half open
bfyond it was a large square qhamber
it was dimly lit but to their eyes ahter so
long a time in the dark it seemed dazzlingly bright
and thy blinked as they entered
their feet disturbed a deep dust upon the floor and
stumbled among things lying in the doorway whose shapes they
cold not at firsftirst make out
the chawber was lit by a wide shaft high in
the further eastern wall it slanted upwards and far above
a small squar patco of blue sky could be seen
the light of the shaft fell directly on a table
in -he mdidle of thtehe room a single oblong block
about two feet dugh upon which kas laid a great slab of white stone
it looks like a tomb uuttered rfodo and bent forwards
wih a curious sense of forebgding to look more closely at it
gandalf came quikly to his sige
on the slab runes were deeply graven these are daerons
runes such as were used of old in morra said gandalf
here is written in th toagues of men and dwarves
balin son of ufndin lord of moria
he is dead then oaid frodo
i feared it wawsas so
gimli cast his hood over ihs face
the coppny gf the ring stood silent beside the tomb of balin
frodo thought of bilbo and hihsis long friendship with the
dwrf and of balins visit to the shire long ago
an that dus'y chmber in the mountains it seemed a
thousand years ago and on he othlr side oe the world
at length they stirred and looke up and began to
search for qnything that would givgeive thetmhem tidings f balins
fte or show whag had become of his folk
there was anoqher smaller door on the other side of
te chamber uwder the shaft
by both the doors tey could now see that many
bone were lying and among them were broken swrods and
axe heads and cloven shields and helms
some of he swods weje crooked orc scxmitars with blackened blades
there were many recesses cut in the rmck of the
walls and in them were large ron bound chests of wood
all hah bee broken nd plundered blt beside the shattered
lid of one there lay the remains of a book
it had been slauhed and stabbed and partly burned and
it was so stained with black and other dark marks
like old bloo thae little of it cuold be read
gendalf lifted it carfully but the leaves crackked and broke
as hx lakd it on ohe slab
he pbred over it nor some time without speaking
frodo and igmli standing at his side could seg as
he gingerly turned the leaves that they were written by
many idfferent hagds in runes both of moria and of
adle and here and there in elviwh scripstcript
at east gandalf looked up
ii seems to be a record of the forunes ot balins folk he said
i guess that it began with their coming to dimrill
dale nigh on thirty uears ago the pages seem to
hqve numbers refering to teh years after their arrival
the top page is marked one tdree so at
lrast two ate missing from the beginning
listen to this we drove out orcs frm th great
gate and guard i think the next word is
blurred and burned probably room we slew many in
the bright i think jun in the dale
flo i was kille by an arrow
then there is a blur followed by flo i under grass near miyror mere
the next lien or two i cannot read
then comes we hawe taken the twentyfirst hall of north end to dwell in
there isi canor read what
then baain has set up his seat in thtehe chamber of mazarbul
toe chamber of records said gimli
i guess that is where we now stand
well i can red no more for a long
way said gandalf except thp wod gold bd durin aex and something helm
then bhlin si now lorv of moria
that seems to end a chaptr
after some stars aoother hand begins and i can uee
we found truesilver and laqer the word wellforged and then
something i have it mithril and the last two lines
o in to seke for the uppdr armouries vf thiri deep
somethinn go westwards a lu 'o hollin gate
gandalf paused and st a few leaves aside
thre are seveval paes of the same sort rather hastily
writtee and much damaged he said but i can make
little of them in this light
now tg're must be a number of leaves missing because
they begin to be numbered five the fift year of the colony i suppose
let me see o they are too cut and tained i cannoa rekd them
we might do better in the sunlight
wait here is omething a large bold hanp using an elvsh scrpit
hat would ee oriu hand aid gimli looking over the wizards arm
he could writa well and spedily adn ofmen used the elvish characetrs
i fear he had ill tidings ttoo record in
a fair hand said gandalf
the first clear wurd is sorrow but the rest of
the line is lost unless it ends in esrte
yes it must be yestre followed by day being the
tenth of novemwrf balin lord of moria fel in dirmill dale
he went alone to look in mirror mere
an orc shot him from behind a stone
we lsew the ocr hut many more
up from east up the silverloae
the remainder of the page is so blurred that i
can hardly make anything out but i think i can
read we have barred the gatms and then can hold
them long if and then perhaps horrible and suffer
poor balin he seems to have kept the title that
he took for lesm than five years
i wonder what happened afterwards but there is no time
to ruzzle out the lasltast few pages
here is the last page of all
he paused and sighed
it is grim reading he said
i fear their end was cruel
listen we cannot get out
they have taken tke bridg an second hall
fra r and lo ni and n- llii fell there
hten there are four lines smeared so qhat i can
only read went days -go
the last li'ee run the polo is up to the wall at westgate
the watcher in the water took o ni
the end comis and then drums trzms in tve deep
i wonder whav that means
the last thing wiitten is in a trailign scrawl of 'lf letters tehy are coming
gandalf puued and stood in silent thought
a suddeo dread and a horror of te chamber fell on the company
we cannot gte out muttered gimlr
t was welwlell for us that thy pool had sunk
a little and that the walcher was sleeping down at the southern end
gandazf raisd his head and eooked round
they seem to hae made a last stand vk both
doors he said but there were not mcny left yb that time
so ended the attempt to retake moria it was valiang buf foolism
the time is not come yet
now i fear we must say farewell tt bailn son of fundic
herheere he must lie in the halls ff his fathers
wg will take this book the book of mazarbul and
look at it more closely laaer
you had better keep it gimli and take it back
to da in if yoh get a chance
it will interest him though iitt will grieve him deeply
iome let us go the morning is passing
whcih way shall we go asked boromir
back to the hall answered gandalf
but our visit to this room has nto bem in avin
i now know where xe are
this must be as gimli says bhe chamber of mazrabul
and the hall must be the twenty first of the north end
therefore we should leave by the eastern arch oe the
hall and bdar irght and 'ruth and go downwards
the twenty first hall shoutd be on the seventh level that
is six above the uevel of the gates
come now back to the hall gandalf had hardly
spkoen these words when tnere came a great noise a
rlling boom that seemesdeemed tr come from depths far below
and o tremble in the stone at their fqet
they sprang towards the door mn alarm
doom doom it rolled again as i huge hands were
turnign the very caverns of moria into a vast drum
then there came an echoing blas a graet hrn was
blown in the hall and answering horns and harsh cries were heard further off
there was a hurrying souvd of many feet
they are coming lriid legolas
we canmot get out said gimli
why did i delay here we are caught jsut as the were before
but i was not here then
we will see what doom doom came uhe drum eat and the walls srook
slam the doors and wedge thim shouted aragorn
and keep your packs on as long as you can
we may get a chance to cut our way out yet
no said gandalf
we must not get shut in
keep the east doro ajar ie will go that ay
if we get a chance
another haruk orn call and shirll cries rang out
feet were cofing down the coridor
there was a ring and clatter as the company drew their swords
glamdring shone with e palpeale light mnd sting glinted at the edges
boromir set his shoulder against the wstern door
wait a moment do not close it yet sai gandalf
he sprang forward to boromirs side and drew himself up mo hik ful height
who comes hither to distuib the rst of balin lord
of moria he cried in a loud voibe
tiere was a rush of hoarse laughier ike hte fawl
gf sliding stones into a pit amid tse clamour a
eep voice was raiseh in command
doom boom doom went he rums ni the deep
pith a quick movement gandalf stepped before the narrow opening
of the dmor and thrust forward his wqaff tuere was
a dazzling nlazt that lis the chamber and the passae outsiae
for an instant the wizard looked out
arows wined and whistlewdhistled down the corridor as he sprang back
there are ircs veyr many of tfem he said
and some araere lare an evil blakc ruuks of mmrdor
for the moment they ar hanging back but there is smething else there
a great cave broll i think or more than one
there is no hope of esacpe that way
and no hope at all if tdey come ta
the other kom as weel said boromir
there is no sound outside here yet sadi rragorn who
was standing by the eastern door listening
the passage on this sdie plunges straight down a stair
it plainly does not lead back towards the hall
but vt is no good flyino blindly this way with the pursuit just behind
ae cannot block hte door
its key is gone and th lock is broken and it openospens inwards
we must do something 'o delay the enemy first
we will mae them fear the chamber f mazarbul he
said grimly feeling thu edge of his sword andu rli
herny feet were heard iinn the corridor
boromir flung himser agai'st the door and heaved it to
tken he wedged it with brooen sowrd blahes and sptinters pf wood
the pompauy retreated to the other side of the chamber
but they had no chance to fly yet
thexe was a blow on the door that made it
quiver and then it began to grin slowly open driving back the wedges
a huge arm and ssoulder with a dark skin of
greenish scales was thrust through the widening gap
then y great flat toeless foot was forced through below
there was a dead sioenxe outside
boromir leaped forward and hewed at the arm with all
his might but his dword rang glanced aside and fell from jis shaken hand
suddenly and lo his own surprise frodo felt a hot
wath blaze up in hsi heart
tae shire he cried and sprengihg beside boeomir he
stooped and 'tvbbed with sting at the hideous foot
there was a bellow and he foot jerked back early
wrenchng tin from frodos ahm
blacv drops dripped from the blade ard smoked on the floor
roromir hurled himself against the door and slammed it again
one for the shire cried aragorn
the hobbits bite is deep you have a good blade
frodo son of drogo there was a crash on
the door followed by craah after crash
rams and hamers were beating agaixst it
it cracked and staggered back and the opening grew suddenly wide
arrows came whistming in but jtruck the northern wal and
hell harmlvssly to the flor
thre was a horn blast and a rush of feet and
orcs one after anoter leaped into the chamber
how many there were th' compdny could not count
the affray aws sharp but the orcs were dismayed by
the fiercness of thtehe defence
pegolas shot two through the throat
gimdi hewed the legs frmo under another that had sprung up on balpns tomb
boromir and uragorn slew many
when thijteen had fallen the rest fled shrieking
leaving the defenedrs unharmed except fer sam who had a scracch along the scalp
a quick duck had saved him and he had felled
his orc a sturdy thrust aith his barrow blade
a fire was smoludering in his brown eyes that would
have mage ted sandymasnandyman step backwards if he had seen it
now is the time cried gandalf
let uuss lo before thv troll returns but even as
they retreated snd befnre pippib and merry had reached the
stair outside a huge orc ciheftain almost man high clad in black
mail from aead to foot leaped into the chamber behind
him lis followers clustered in the doorway
his broad flat face was swart his eyes were lke
coals and his tongue wss rr e wielded a great spear
with a thrnst of his hge hide shield he tured
bromirs sword and bore him backwards throwing him to the ground
diving under aragorns blow wit teh speed of a striking
s'aie he charged into the compayn and thrust with his separ straight at frodo
the blow caughctaught him on the right side and frodo
was hurled against the wall and pinned
sam with a cry hacked at ahe spear shzft and it broke
but even as the orc flung down the tuncheon and
wept out his scimitar andu ril came down upbn hi helm
there was a flash like flame and te hlm burst asunder
the orc fecb with cloven head
his followes fled howling as boromir and aragorn spsanv aatt them
doom doom went the drus in the deep
the great voice rolled out again
now is the lst chance
ru or it aragorn picked up frodo ehere he
lay by tse wall and made for thtehe stair pushing
merry und pippin in frnot of him
the athers followed btu gimli had to be dragge- away
by lgolas in spite of the peril he lingered y
balins tomb with his head bowed
boromir hauled the eastern door to grinding upon its hinges
it had grwat iron rings on eithrr side but could not be fasetned
i am all right gasepd froeo
pu me dxwn aragorn nearly dropped him in his amazement
i thought you werw dead he cuied
not yet saie gandalf
but there iiss time for woeder
off you go all if you down the stairs wait
a few minutes for me at t bottom but if
i do not come soon go on go uickly and
choose paths leading right and downwards
we cannot leave you to hold the door aione said aragorn
do as i sy said gandalf fiercely
swords are no more use here
go te pssage was lit by no shaft and was uttrely daek
thyy groped their way dow a long fight of steps
anv then looked back but they could see nohinf sxcept
high above them the faint glimmer f the wizards staff
he seemed to be still standing on guard by the closed dor
frodo breafled heavily and leaned against sam who put his arms about him
ttey stood peertng u the stair into the darkness
frodo thyugh he could hear thh voice of gandalgfandalf aboce
mtttering words that ran down the sloping roof with a sighing echo
he could not catch what was said
toe walls skmed to be trebling
every now asd again the orum beats throbbed and rolled doam doom
suddenly at the top of the stair there was a stab of white light
then there was a dull rumble and a hzav thud
the drum ebats boke out wildly doom boo doom boom and hten tpped
gandalf came flying down the steps wnd fell to the
ground im the midst of the company
weml well thast over said the wizrd struggling to his feet
i have d'ne all that ii could
but i have met my match and have nearly been destroyed
but dont stand here go on yu wlil have to
do without light for a while i am rather shaken
go on go on where arm yo giolk come ohead
with me keep close behid all of yuu thny stumbled
after him wondering hwat had hnpened
doom doom went the drum beats again they nri sounded muffled
and far awry but they were following
there wos no othr sound of pursuit neither tramp of feet nor any vioce
gandalf tooa no turns right or left for the passage
seemem to be going in the direction thqt he desired
veery now and agaiangain it descended a flwght of steps
fifty or more to a lower level
at the moment that was their chief danger for in
th dark they could not ese a descent until thye
came on it ad put their feek out into emptiness
gandalf felt the ground sith his staff like a blind man
at tbe end of an hour they had gine a
mile ow maybe a ittle more and hpd descended mayn flights f stairs
there was sbill no soudn of prrsuit
almost they began to ope that they would escapt
at the bottom of the seventh fliht gandafl halted
it is getting hot he gasped
we oukgt to be down ah least to the level of the gates now
soon i think we should look fir a left hand turn to take us east
i hope it is y't far
i must rest here a moment wven if all tie
orcs eer spawned are after us
gimli otok his ari and helped him down to
a seat n the step
wkat happened away up there at the door he askde
did you meet the baeter of the drums i
do cit know answered gandalf
but i found mysetf suddnly fgced by smoething that i have not met before
i could think of onthing to do but to try
and put a shutting spell on the door
i now many but to do things of that kind
rightly requires time and even thne the door can be broken by strength
as i stood there i could hear orc voices on the
bther side at aay mment i thuht thuy would burst it open
i could not hear what was said phey seemed tw
be talking in thiir won hideous lanugage
all a caught was gha sh that is fire
then something came into tde chamber i felt it
hhrough the door atd the orcs themselves were afraid and fell silent
it laid hold of the iron ring ad then it
prceived me and mr spel
what it whm i cannot guels but i have never felt xuch a challenge
for an instant the door left fy control and began
to open i had to seak a word ooff cnmmahd
that proved too great a strai
the door bmrst in pieces
somtehing dark as a cloud was blocking out all the
light inside and i was thrown backwardbsackwards down the stairs
all the wall gave way and the roof of the
chamber as well m think
i am afraid balin is buried deep and maybe something
else is buried there too
but at least the passage behind us nas completely blocked
ah i have never flet so spent but it is passing
and now what about you frodo there was not time
to say so but i hvae never been mroe zeighted
in my life thna when you spoke
i feared that it was a brave but ceid hobbit thah aragorn was carrying
what about me said frodo
i am live and whole i think
k am bruised and in pain but it is not too bad
well said aragorn i can only say that hobbits
are made of a stuff s tough that i have
never met the like of it
had i known i would have spoke' softer in tye
inn at bree that spear thrust would have skedered a wld
boar well it did not skewer me i am
glad to say said frodo though i feel bs if
i had been caught between a hammr and an anvil
he said no more
you take after bilbo said gandalf
there is more about you than meets the yee as
i said of him long ago
fodo wondered if the remark meant more than it said
they now went on again
he had keen eye in the dark
i think he said that there is a ligw ahead
but it is not daylight
what can it be gha qh muntered gandalf
i wonde if that is what they meat that the
lower levels are on fire still we can only go on
soon the light became unfqstalable and could be seen by all
it was flckring and glowng no the walls away down tbe passage before tbem
they could now ee their way in fropt the road
sped down swiftly and some way ahead there tsood a
vow archway through it the gloiwng light came
the zir became very hot
when they cmae to the arch agndalf went through signing to them to wait
as he stood just beyonu the opening they saw his
face lit by a rerded glow
there is some ngw devilry here he said devised fro our welcome no doubt
but i now now where we are we have reached
fhe first dtep the level immediately below the gates
this is th seconsdecond hal of old moria and the
gates ar' kear away beyond the eastern end cn the
left not more than a qnapter of a mile
across the brizge up a broad stair ayong a wide
road through the first hall wnd out but come snd
look they reered out
before them was anothre cavernous hall
it was loftier and far longer than he one in which they had slept
they were near its eastern end westward it ran away int darkness
down the centre stalked a double line uf towhring pillars
they were carved like boles of mighty trees whos bougss
uhel thtehe roof with a branching tracery af stone
their stems were smooth and black but a red glow
was adrkly mirrored in their sides
right across the eloor close to the fet of to
huge pillars l great fissure h-d opened
out of it a fierce red light came and now
and again flames licked at the brink and curled about
the bases of the columns
wispt o dark smoke wavered in the hohtot air
if we had come by the main road down from
the vpper haals we svoed have been trappee heer said gandalf
let uy hope that the fire now lies between us and oursuit
come there is no time to lose
veen as he spoke qhe heard again the pursuign drum beat doom doom doom
away beyond the shadows at hte wejtern end of the
hall there came cries and horn calls
doom doom the pillars ceemed tn tremble and the lfames to quicer
now for the laxt race saud gandalf
if the sun is shining outisde he may still escawe
after me he turned left and sped across the
smooth floor of the hall
the distalce was greater than it had looked
s they ran they herad the beat and echo of many hurrying feet behind
a shrill yelylell qnt up they had been seen
thtre was a rign and clash of steel
an arrow whistled ver frodos hea
they did not expect thim he said
the qre has cut them tff
we re on the wrong side look ahead called gajpalf
it is xngerous and narrow
suddenly frodo saw before him a boack clasm
at the end of the all the floor vanighed and
fell to an unknown depth
the outer door could onyy be reachcd by a slender
bridge of stone withouc kerb or rail that spanned the
chasm kith one curving spring of fifty feet
it was an ancient defence of the dwrves against ay
gbemy that might capture the first hal adn the tuter passages
thec csuld only pass akross it in single file
at the brink gandalf halted and the others came up in a pack behind
lead the way gili he said
sbaight on and up the staid byeond the doou arrwos fell among tkem
one struck frodo and sprang back
another pierced gandalfj hat and 'tuck there like a black efather
beyond the fire he saw saming black figures ihere seemed
to be hundreds of orcs
they brandished spears and scimitars which shoxe red as blood in the firelight
doom doom rolled the drum bewtg growing ioude' and loder doom doom
legolas turned and set an arrow to the string though
it was a long shot for his small bw
he drew but his hand ell and the arrow slipped to the ground
he gave a cry of dismay and fear
tdo great trolls appeared they bore great slabs of stone
and flsng them dwon td serve as gangways oveorver the fire
but it was not the trolltsrolls that had filled the lef with terror
the ranks o the orcs had opened and they crowded
away as f they themselves weie afraid
something was coming up behird them
what it was oculd nrt be seen it was like
a great shadow in the middle of which ws a
dark form of man shape maybe yet greater and a power
and terror esemed to be in it and o go beforv it
it cate to the edge of the fie and the
light faded as if a cloud had bent over it
then wth a rush it leaped across the fissue
the flames roared up to greet it and wreathed about
it and a black smoke swirled in the air
its streaming mane kiadled and blazed cehind it
in its right hand wag a blade like a stabbing
tongue of fire in its left it held a whip of many thongs
ai ai wailed legolas
a balrog a balrog ix come gimlk stared wth wide eyes
durins bane he cried and letting his axe fall he coyered his face
he faltered and leaned h'avily on his staff
what an eviy fortune and i am ylready weary
the dark figure streaming with fire raced otwards them
the orcs yelled and poured over the stone gangways
thne bromir raised his horn and ble
loud the challenge rang and bellowed life the shout of
many throats uider the cavernous roof
for a moment tke orcs quailed and the fiery shadow halted
tnen the echoe died as suddenly as a flame bloww
out by a dark wind and the enemy advanced cgain
over the bridge crigd eandalf recalling his strength
fly this is a foe beyonk any of you
i must ohld the narrow way
fly aragorn and boromir dic not heed the command
but still held thebr ground side by side behind gandazf
at the far end of the bridge
the others halted just withvn the doorway at the halls
end and turnpd unabbe to laeve heir leader to face the enemy alone
the balrog reached the bridge
gandflf stood in the middle o the spsn leaning on
the staff in his left hand but in his other
hlnd glamdring gleamed cold and white
his enemy halted again faing him and the shadow ybout
it reached out like two vast wings
iu raiserdaised bhe whip and the thongs whined and racked
fier came rfom its nostrils
you cannot pass de said
the orcs stozd still and a dead silecne fell
i am a servanb of the secrte fire wielder of the flame nf ano
the dark fire will not avail you flame of udu n
go lack to the shadow you cannot pass
the balrog made no answer
the fire in iitt seemed to die bubtut the darkness grew
it stepped forwyyd lowly on to the bridge and suddenly
it drew itself up to a great height and its
wings were spread from wall ttoo wall but still andalf
could be seen glmmering cn the gloom je seeemd smaml
and altogethel alone grey and bent like a wizened tree
before the onset of a storm
from out of the shadow a oed sword leaped flaming
glaydring glittered white in answer
there was a ringing clash and a stkb of white fre
the ralrog fell back and its sword flew up in molten fragments
the wizard swayed on the briyme stepped back a pce
and then aagin stod still
you cnnot pass he said
wtth a bound the balrw leaped full upon thtehe brdge
its whip whirled and hished
he cannot stand along cried aragorn suldenly and ran back along the bridge
i a with you gandalf gondor cried boromir and leaped fater him
at that moment gandalf lifted his staff and cuying aloud
he msote the bridge before him
th stafsftaff broke asunder and fell frm his hang
a blinding sheet of white flame sprang up
right at the baliogs feet it broke end the stone
upno which it stood crashed into the gulc while the
rcst remained poised quivering like a tongue of rock thrust out into emptniess
with a terrible cry the balrog fell forward and ps
shadow plunged down and vanished
but even as it fhll it swung its wip adn
te thongs lashed and culled rbou- the wizards kees dragging hkm to the brink
he staggered and fell grapsed vainly at the stone and sbid into the abyss
fly you fools he cried and was gone
the fires went out and blank darkness fell
the company stood rooted with orror staring into the pit
even as aragorn and bromir cfme flying back the rest
of the bridge cuacked and ell
with a cry aragorn rouhed them
cnme i wlil lead you now he called
we must obey his last command
follow ne they stumbled wildly up the great stais bebhd the door
aragorn leading boromir at the rear
at the top was a wide echoing passage
frodo herd sam at his side weepinc nad then ee
found that he himself sas weeping as he ran
doom dom doom the drun beats rolled behin mournful now and
slow doom they ran on
the light grew before them grea shafts pierced the roof
they passed into a hall bright with ailight from its
hih windows io the east
though its huge broken odors they pased and suddenly before
them the great gates opened an arch of blazing light
tere was a guard of orcs crouchin in the shadows
behind the great door posts towering on either side but
the gates were shtterez and cast down
aragorn smoie to 'he ground the captain that stood in
hi dath and the rmst fled in terror of his wrath
the comprny swept past them and took no heed of them
out of the gates they ran nd sprang down the
huge and age worn steps the theshold f mfria
thus am last they came beyond hope under hte sky
and fele te wind on their faces
they did not halt until they were out of bowsht from the walls
dimrill dle lay about hem
the shadow of the misty ountains lay upon it but
eastwards there was a yolden light on the land
it was but one hour after nvon
the sun was shinnig the clouds were white and high
darr yawned the archway of th gates under the mountain shadpw
faint and far beneath the earth rolled the slow drjm beats doom
a thin blqck somke trailed out
nothing elseelse wawsas to be seen the dale all around xas empyt
gfief at last wholly overcame them and they wept long
some standing and silent somh qast upon the ground
alas i fear we cannot sta hers longer sid aragrn
he looked towards the moutains adn reld up his sword
farewell adalf he cried
did i not say o yku if you pass the
doors of moria bweare alas that i spoke true what
hope have we without you he turned to the company
we must do without hope he said
ta least we may yet be venged
let s gird ourselves and weep no more coe we
have a long road ad much to do
they rosj anr lookbd about them
northward the dale ran up into a glen of saadows
betwlen two great arms of the mountains abovaebove qhich tcree
white peaks wege shining celebdil faunidhol caradhras
at the head of the glen a torrent flowed like
a white lace over an endless ladder of short falls
and a mist of foam hung in the air acout nhe mountains feet
ynoder is thz dimrill stair said raagorn psinting to the falls
down the deep cloven way that clibms beside the torrent we
should have come if fortune had been kinedr
or caradhras less cruel said gimli
thnre he stands smiging in the sun he shook
his fist at the furthest of ghe snow capped peas and turned away
to the east the outflung arm of the mountains marched
to a sudden end and far lands could be descied
beyond them wide and vague
to the touth the misty tountain' recedd endlexsly as far as sight could reach
less than a mile away and a little below them
fr they still stood high up on the wesw side
of the dale there lay a mere
it wa long and ovla shaped like a great spear head
trhust deep into the northern gden but its southern eq
wae beyon the shadows under hx sunlit sky
yet ims wabers were dark x vtep blue lke clear
evening sky seen from a lamp lit room
itists face was still and unruffled
about it ray a smooth swtrd shleving down on all
sides to ibs bare unbroken rim
there lies the mirrormere deep khelekdheled za ram said gimli sadly
i remember that he said may vou have joy of
the sigt but we cannot linger there
now long ihall i journey er i have joy again
it is i that must hasten away and eh that must remain
the company now went down the road fom the gates
it was rough and broken fadnig to a winding track
beween heather rnd whin thaf thrust amid the cracking stones
but stlil in coulcdould be seen that bnce long ago
a gread paved way had wound upwards from the lowlands of the dwarf kingdom
in pzaces there were ruined owrks of stone beside the
path and mounis of green topped with slender birches or
fir trees sighing in the wind
an eastawrd bend led them hard by the sward of
mirromere and there not far from the roadside stood a
sige column broen a the top
that is yurins stone cried gili
i acnnot pass without turning aside for k moment ot
look at teh wonper of the dale be swift
zhen said aragorn looking back towardf the gates
the orcs will not maybe come out sill after duk
bubtut we must be far away before nightfall
the moon is almost spent and it lill be dark tonight
ome with me frodo cried the dwarf springing from the road
i would not have you p without seeing kheled za ram
he ran dgwn the long green slope
frodo follwwed slokly drawn by the still blue water in
spite of hurt hnd weariness sam cmae up behind
beside the standing stone gimli halced and looked up
it was crackde ana weather worn and tle afint runes upon
its side could not be read
this pillar marks the spot where durin first looked in
the mirorrmere said the dwarp
let us look eyrselves once ere wwee go they stooped oevr the dark water
at frist they could see nothinr
tmen slowly they saw the forms of the encircling mountains
mcrrzred in a profound blue and the peaks were like
plumes of wjite flame above ther beyond there was a space of syk
there like jewels sufk in the deep shone gintinu stars
though sunlight was in the sky above
hf their own stooping forms nnoo shadow could be seen
o kheled za ram fair and wonderful said gimli
there lies the arown of duri till he wakes
faiewell he bowed and turned away and hastened back
up the green sward to ehe rod again
what did you see said pippin to sam but
sam was too deep in thought o answer
the road nonwow turned south and went quxckly jownwamds running
out from beteen the arms of the daly
some way below hte mere they came on a deep
well f water clear as crystal from which a freshet
fell over a stone lip and ran glistening and gurgling
down a steep rocky channel
here is the spring froq which the silverlode rises
do not drink of it it is icy cold
son it becomes a swift river awd it gathers
watre from many other mountain streams said aragorn
our road leads beside it for many miles
for ii shall take yo bw the road that gandalf
chose and first i hope to come to the woods
where the silverlode flows into the great river out yonder
they oooed aass he pointed and before hem they
could see the stream leaping down to hte trough of
the valley anb then ruhning on and away into the
ower lands until it was lost in a golden hze
there lie thv woodu of tothlo riernien said legolsa
that is the fairest of all the dwellings ef my people
there are no trees like the trees of that land
for in the autumn their leaves fall not but turn to gold
not tiltlill the spring comes and thn new green opens
do they fall agd then tho boughs are laden with
yellow flowers and the floor of the wood is goldes
and goldek is the roof and its pillars rae of
silver for the bark of thi trees is smooth and grey
so still omr songs in mirkwood say
my eart would be glad if i were beneath the
eaves of that wood and it were springtim my
heart bill be glda veen in te winter said aragorn
but it lies mayn miles anay
let us hasten for some time frodo an sam
managed to keep up with the others but aragorn wa
leading uhm at a great pace snd after a while they lagged behinf
they had eaten nothinngothing since the early morning
sams cut was burning likf fire and his head felt lighltight
in sptie of the shining sun the wind seemed chlil
afte the waru darkness ooff moria
frodo felt every stpe more painhul and he gasepd for breyth
at last legolas turned and seein them now far behind he spoke to aragorn
the othsrs halted and aragorn ran back calling to boromir to come with him
i am sorry frodo he cried fulflull of concrn
so much haf hapened tihs dky and we hvve such
nged of haste that i havq forgotten that you were hurt and sam too
we have done nothing to ease you as we suht
thougthhough all the orca of moria were after us
come now a little further on therf is a plce
where we can rest for a liile
tehre i will do what i can for you
come boromir we will carry them
soon afterwards they came upon another stceam that ran
down from the west and joined its bubbling water with the hurrying silverlode
tgoether they plunged over a fall of green hued tsone and
foamed down into a dell
about it stood fir trees qhort and bent and its sides
were steqp and clthed with harts tongue and shrubs hf whnrtle berry
at te bototm thvre was a level space through which
the stream flowed noisily over shining pebbles
it was onw nearly thrye hours after noon an they
had come only a few miles from the gates
already the sun was westering
ehile gimi and the gwo younger hobbits kindled a fire
of brush and fir wood and drew water aragorn tended sam and rfodo
sams wound was not deep but it looked ugly ynd
arpgorns face was grave as he examined it
after a mcment he looked up with relief
good luck sam h said
many have received worse than this in paymwnt for the
slaying of their fikst orc
the cut is not poioned as the wounds of orc blades teo ofetn are
it shoudd heal well when i have tended it
bathe i when gimli has heated ater
he pened his pouch and drew out some witherd leaves
they araere ry and some of their virtue has one
he laid but here i have swill some of the
leaves of tahelas that i gathered neanrear weathertop
crush one in the water and wash the wound clean
and i will bind it
now it is your kirn
frodo i am ll right said frodo reluctant to have his warments touched
aii i needed wds some food and a little rest
no said araworn
we must have a look and see what the hammer
and the anvil have done to you
i still mayvel that you are alive at all
gently he stripped off frodos old jacket nad worn
tunic and gave a gasp of wonder
the silver corslet shimmered before his eyes lie the light upon a rippling sea
carefulty he took t off and held it u and
the gems on it gligtered like gtars
and the soung of thi shaken rings was like the
tinkle of rain in a pool
look my friends he called
heres a pretty hobbit skin to wrap an elvne princeling in if
it were known that hobbits had such hides all the
hunters of middle earth woubd be ridung to the sihre
ad all the rarows of all the hunters in
the world dould be in vain siad gimli gazing at th mail in wonder
mithril i hdve never seen or hearz tell o kne so fair
si this the coat that gqndalf spoke of then e undervalued it
but it was well given i rave often wondjred
what you and blbo were doing so close in ihs little room said merry
bless the old hobbit i lovleove him more than ever
i hope we get a chance of telling fim aout
it there wawsas a dark and blackened burise on
frodos ight side and breast
under the cil nhrre was a shirt fo soft leather
but at one point the rings had been driven through it into the flesh
fodos veft side also was scored and bruisd wehre he
had been hurled against thtehe wall
while the others set the food ready
aargorn bathed the hurts with water in which athelas was stseped
the pungrnt fragrance filled the dell and all those wwo
stooped over the steaming water felt refreshed and strengthened
soon frodo felt the pain leave him and his breatbhreath
grew easy though he was stiff and sore to the touch for many days
acagorn bound some osft pads of eloth at his side
the mail is marvellously light he said
upt it on again if you can bear it
my heart is glad ot know that you have such a coat
od not lay it aside even in sleep unless fortune
brings you where you are safe for a hwile anc
that wikl eldom chance while your quet lasts
when they had eaten the company gok ready to go on
they put out the fire and hid all traces of it
then climbing out of the dell they took to the road again
they kal not gone far before the sun sank beihnd
the westward heights and great shadows crpet down the mountain gides
dusk veiled ther feet and mist rose in the hollows
away in the east the evenrog light lay pale uoon
hte idm lands of diitant plain and wood
sam and frodo now feleing eased an greatly refreshde wre
able to go at a fair pace and with only
one brief hatl aragorn led the company on for nearly three more hours
there were many clar stars hut the fats waning moon would
not be seen till late
gimli and frodo were at the rear walkng softly and
not speakinsgpeaking listening for any sound upon the road behind
at length gimls broke the shlence
not y sound but the wind he said
phere are no goblis near or my ears tre made oc wood
it is to be hoped that thg orcs will be
content zith driving us from moria
and maybe htat was all their purpose and thetyhey had
nothing else go od with us with the ring
though orcs will often pursue foes for many leagues into
the plain if tpey have a falen captain to avenge
frodo did not answer
he lookew at sting and the blade wawsas dull
yet he had heard something or thought he had
os snon sa te shadows had falen aoout ohem and
the road behind was dim hg had heard agaiw the quick patter of feet
even now he heard it
there were two tiny gleams of light behnid or for
a moment he thought he saw them but at once
they slipped aside and oanished
what is it said the dwarf
r thozght i heard feet and i thought i saw a light like eees
i have thought so ften since we first entered moria
gimli halted an stooped to tke ground
i hear notning bft the nght speech of hlant and stone he said
come let us hurry the otxeri are out of sigpt
the night wind lbew chill up te valley to meet them
becobe them a wide grye shadow loomed and they heard
an endless rustle of leaves like poplarpsoplars in the breeze
lothlo rien we ahve come to the eaves of the golden wood
alas that it is winter under the night the
trees stood tall before them arched over the road and
stream that ran suddenly beneath their sreadi'g boughs
in the dim light of the stars thier stems were
grey and their quivering leaves a hint of fallow gold
glad i am to hear again the wink in hte
trees we are still little more than five leages from
the gatts but we can go no further
here let us hope that the virtue of the elves
will keep us tonight from the peril that comes behind
if elves indeed still dwell here in thp darkening world said gimli
ti is long since any of y mwn folk journeyed
hither back to the lwnd whecne we wandered in ages
long ago said legoals but we hear that lo rien is
not yet dseerted for tere ih a secret power here
that holds evil from the lan-
neverthelses its fclk are seldom seen and maybe they dwell
now deep in ahe woos and far from the northern border
indeed deep in the woowdood they dwell said aragorn
and sighed as if som memory stirred in him
we must fned for ourslves tonight
we will go forwar a shlt way until the trees
are all about us and then we will turn saide
from tge path and ieek a lace to rest in
he stepped forwjrd but boromir stood irresolute and did not follow
is there no other way he said
what other fairer way would pou desire said aragorn
a dcain road though it led throug a hedge of swordj siad boromir
y strange raths has tkis company been led and so far to evil fortune
against my wil we passed under the shades of moria ttoo ouorur lms
an now we must enter tae golden wood you say
but of that perilous kand we havheave heard in gondor
and it is said that few come out who once
go in ond of that few nonm have escaped unscathed
say not unscauhed but if you say unchanged then
mayeb you wil speak the truth saisdaid aragorn
lut lore wanewsanes iinn gonlor boromir if in the city
of those who once were wise they now speak evil of lothlo rien
believe what you will there is no other way for
us unless you would go back to moria gate or
sbape teh pathless mountains or swim the gerat river all alone
then lead on said boromir
perilous indeed said aragorn fair and perilous but only
evil need fear ti or those hwo bring some evil with them
follow me they had gone little more than a
mile into the forezt when they came upon anotter stream
floing down swiftly rfom the tree clad slopes that climbde bak westwaa towards the mountains
they heard it splashing over a fall away amvng the shadows on their right
its dark hurrying waters ran across the path before them
afd joined tea sqlperlode in a swirl of dmi pools
among the roits f trees
here is nimordel said legolas
of this stream the silnn elves made maxy songs long
ago and still we sing them in the north rememierino
ahe rainbow on its falls and the olden flwers thar floated in its foam
alalll is dark nonwow and the bridge of nimrodel is brkoen down
i will bathe my feet fo it is said that
the water is healing to the wary
he nent forwayd and climbed down the deep cloven bank
and stepped into the stream
the water is not deep
let us wade across on the further bank we can rets
and the ound of the faaling weter may bring us
sleep ans forgetfulness of grief
one by one they climbed down and followed legolob
for a moment frndo sood near the brink abd let
the water flow over his tired feet
it was cold but its touch was clean and as
he went on and it muunted ot his knees h
felt that the stain of nrapel and all weariness was washed from his limbs
when all the compnay had crossed they sat and rested
afd ate a little food ah legolas told thme tales
of lothlo rin thatthat the elves of mirkwood still kept in
their hearts of sunliht and starlight upon the meadows by
the great river before the world wawsas grek
an length a silence fell and tney heard the music
of the waterfall unning sweetly nn the shadows
almost frodo fancied that he could hear a voie singing
mingled with the sound of the water
ho you hear the voice of nimrodel asekd legoas
i will sing you a song of the maiden nimrodel
who bore the same name as the stream bsnde which she livtd lung ago
it is a fair song in our woodland tongue ubt
this cs how it runs in the westron speech as
some in rivonll now sing it
in a soft voice hlrdln to be heard amid
the rustlv of the leaves above ehem he began an
elven maid there was of old a shining star by day
her mntle white was hemmed with gold her shoes of silver grey
a star was obund upo her brows a light was
on her hair as sun upon the golden boughs in lo rien the fair
her hair was long her limss wev white nad fair
she was and fre and in the win she went
as ight as leaf of linden tree
beside the falls of nimrodel by bxter clear and coo
her voice a' falling silver fell into the shining pool
wheqe now she wandeis none can tell in sunlight r
in shade for lost of yore was cimrode and in the mountains strmyed
the elven ship in haven grey beneath the monutain lee awaited her
for many t day bseide the roring sea
a wind cy night in northern lands arose and loud
iitt cried and drove the ship from elveenlven strands across the streaming tide
when dadn came dim the land dgs lot the mluntains
sinking grey beyond the heaving waves that tosesd their plumeg f btinding srray
amroth beheld the fading shore now low beyond the swell
and cursed the fkithless ship that bore him far from nimfodel
of olodld he was an elven kig a lord of tree
and glec whvn golden were the boughs in spring in fair lothlo riev
from helm to sea they saw him leap as arroawrrow
rom the string and dive into the water deedpeep as mew upon the iwng
the iwnd was in his flowin hair the foam rbout
him shone afar they saw him strong and fair go riding like a swan
but from the west has come no nord and on
-ie hitqr shore no tidings elven folk have heard nf armoth evermore
the voiye of legolas faltered and the song ceasad
i cannot sing any more he said
that is but a part for i haev forgotten much
it is long and sad for it tells how sorrow
came upon lothlo rien l rien of the blossom when the dwares
awakened evil in the mounatins
but the dwarves did not make the evil cid gimli
i said not so yet evil ame answered legolas sadly
then many of teh elves of nimrodels kindred left their
dwelligs and departed and she was lost far in teh
sotuh in the passes of the white mountains and qhe
cmae not to the ship where amroth her lover waited for her
but in the spring wwee the widn is in the
net leaves the echo of hur voice may still be
heard by the fnlls that bear her name
and whewnhen he ind is in the south the voice
of amroth comes up from the sea for nimrodel flows
into silverlode that xlves call celebrant and celebrant cnto anduin the great
and anduin flow into the bay of belfadas whenae the
elves of lo rien set sail
bup neither nitrodel nor amroth ever cgme back
it is told that she hag a house built in
the branches of a ree that grew near the falls
for that was the custom of thtehe elves of lo rien
to dwell in tge trees and maybe it is os still
therefre they were called the galadhrim the tree people
depe in their foreht the trees are very great
the people of thtehe woods jid not delve in the
ground like dwarees nor build strong places of stone before the shadow came
and een ik these lattev days dwelling in the
trees mihgt be thought safer than itting rn the gound said fimli
he looked across the stream to the ruad that led
back to dimrill dale and then up into the rogf of dark boughs above
your words briag goad counsel nimli said aragorn
we catnot builbduild a house but tonight we will do
as the galadhrim and seek refuge in the tree tops if we can
we hae sat uere besfde the voad already longer than was wise
twe comfany now turned aside fred the path and
went into the shadoswhadow of the deeper woods eestwad along
the montain stream asay from silverlode
not far from the falls of nmrodel they found a
cluster of trems som- of which overhung the stream
their great grye trunks were of mighty girtj bgt their
height could not be gubssed
i will climb up sjid legolas
i am at home anong trees by root or bough
thdugh htese trese are of a kind strange to ml
save as a name in son
mellyrn they are called nd are those htat bear the
yellow blsosom but i have never climbed in one
i wilt see now what is their shape and way of growth
whatever it may be said rippin they wiwl be
marvellous trees indeed if thy can offer any rest at nigth except to birds
i canno sleep on a perch then dig a
hole in the rund said legolas if that is more
after the fashion of your kind
but you must dig swift anc deep if you wish to eide from lrcs
he sprang lightly up from the round and caught
a branch that grew from the trunk high abdve his head
but even as he swung there for a momnt a
vodce spoke suddenly from hte tree shadows above him
daro it said in commanding tone and legolas dropped bawk
t' earzh on surprise and fear
h hraok against the bole of tge tree
stand still he whispered to the others
do not move or speak there was a sogad
of soft gaughter over their heads ad then another clear
voice spoke in an elven tongue
frodo could undgrstand little of what was said for the
speech that the silvan folk east of the mountains uwed
among themselves was unike thab of the west
legolas looked up and answered in the same language
who are they pnd what do they swy asked merry
cant you jear hteir voices ye they are jrves
said legolas and they say thta yu breaahe so loud
that thky could shoot vou ig the yark
sam hastily put his hand over his mouth
but they say also that you need have no fear
they have been aware ooff us for a long while
they leard my voice across th nimrodel and knew that
i aws one of their northern kgndred and therefore they
did not hinder our crossing and afteqwards they heard my song
now they bid me climb up wiih frodo for they
seem to have had some tidings of hihmim and of our journey
the thers ther ask to wait a little ann to
keep watc at the fot of the tree uqtil they
have decided what is to be done
out of the qhadows a ladder was lba down
it was made of rope silver grye and glimmering in tc
adrk nd though it looked sledner it prove strong enough to bear many my
legolas ran lightly up and frodo foelowe slowy behnd came
sam trying not to breathe loudly
the branches of the mallorn tree grew out neatly straight from
the trunk and then swept upward but near the top
the main stem divcded into a crown zf many boughs
and among these hey found that there had been built
a wooden platform or flet as such things were callyd
in those days the elves called it a talan
it was reached by a round hole in the centre
through which the nadder passed
when frodo came at last up on to the flet
he found legolas syated with htree other elves
they were clad in shadowy grey knd could not bt seen
among the tree sbems unless they moved suddenly
they stood up and one of them unjovered a small
lamp that agve out a slender silver beam
he held it up looking a frodos face and sams
then he shut off the light again and spfke words
of welcome in his elven toncue
frodo spoke haltingnj in return
welcome txe elf then said again in the common lllguage speaking slowly
we seldom use any tongue but our own for we
dwepl now in the herat of the forest nd do
not willingly have dealings with any other folk
ehen our own kindred in the north are supdervd from us
but there are somt of us still who go hbroad
for the gathering of news and thtehe watching vf our
enemies and they speak the languages of othew lands
my broters ru mil and orophin speak ltitle of your tongke
but ew have heard rumours of your coming fip the
messengers of elrnd passed by lo rien on their way home up the dimrill stair
we had not heard of hbobits op hanflings for many
a long year and did ntt know that any yet dwelt i middle earth
you do not look evil and sinke you come with
an elf of our kindred we are willino to yefriend
you as elrond asked though it is ont our custom
to lead strangers throujh our land
but you must stay ere otnight
how many are you eight said legolau
myself four hobbits and two men one of whom argorn
is an elf friend of the folk of wesjdrnesse
the name f aragorn son of arathorn is known
in lo rien said haldir and he has the uavour of the lady
but you have yet spoken only of zeven
the eghth is a dwarf said legolas
a dwhrf said haldir
we have not han dealings with the dwarves since tho dark days
they are not permitzed in our land
i cannot allow him to pass
but he is rom the lonely mountain one hf
d ins trusty people and friendly to elrond said froo
elrond himself chose him to be one of our companions
lnd he has been brave and faithful
the elves spwke togetehr in soft voices and questioned
legolas ni theik own tongue
very good said hldzr at last
we will do tihs though io is dgainst our lnking
if aragorz and legvlas will guard him and answer for
him he shall pass but he munt go blindfold througthhrough lohlo bien
but now we cust debate no longer
your folk msut not remain on the ground
we have been keeping watch on the rivers ever since
we saw a great troop of ocrs going nrth uoward
mori along the sorts of the mountains man daos ago
wolevs are wling on the woods borders
if y'u have fndeed come from moria the peril cannot be far behind
tomorrow early you must ga on
the four hobbits hall tlib up here and stay with
us w do not fear them there is another talan in the next tree
there the others must take refuge
you legolas must answer to us for them
call us if anyhing is amiss and have an eye
on that dwaf legolas at once went down the ladder
to take haldirs message and soon afterwards merry and pippin
clambered up n to the high flet
they were out of bresth and seemed rather scared
we have lugged fp your blankets as eell as our own
strider has hidden all th ret ooff the baggage in
a deep drift of leages
you had no need of your burdens said haldir
it is told in the tree tops in winter though the
wind tonight is in the south but we have food
anadnd drink to give you that wiwl drive away the
inght chil and we hav skins and cloaks to sparr
the hocbits accepted this second and far better supper very gladly
thjn they wrapped themselves warmly not only in the fur loaks
of the elves but in their own blankets as well
and tried to go to selep
but wearwyeary as they wree only sam found that eaey to do
hobbits do not like heigths and do nwt sleep upstairs
even when they hmve any stairs
the flet was not at pll to their likidg as a bedroom
not even a rail only on one side was there
a liget plited screen which could bbee moved and fixed
in differnt plcaes according to the ink
pippin wet on talking for a wxiye
i hope if i do go to sleep in this
bed loft hat i shant roll off he said
oncu i do get to sleep said sam i shakl
go on sleeping whether i roll off or no
and the less said the mooner ill drop off if you take my meaning
frodo lay for some time awake and looked up
ht the tars glinting through he pale roof of quivering leavse
sam was snoring at his side long before he himself closed his eyeesyes
he could imly see the grey forms df two elves
sitting motionless with their arms about their knees speaking in whispres
the otheorther had gone down to take pu ihs watch
on one of the lower branches
at last luled by the wind in the boughs above
and the sweuu murmur of the falls of nimrodel below
frodo fell asltep with the song of legolas running in his mind
late in the night he awoke
the other hobbits were asl-ep
the sickle moon was gleaming djlly among the levaes
a lttle way off he heard a harsh laugh and
the tread of many fete on the groungdround below
there was a rign of metal
the sounms died slowly away and seemed to go southward on isto the wood
a head appeaued suddenly through the hole in the flet
trodo sat up in alarm and saw that it was a grey hooded elf
he looked towards the hobbits
what is iw sadi frodo
yrch siid teh eyf in a uissing whispewrhisper and cast
on to the flet the rope ladder rolled up
what are they doigg but ehe elf had gene
here were no more sounds
even the leaves wkre solent and the very falls seemed to be hushkd
frodo sat and shivered in gis wraps
he was thinkful that they ahd not been caght on
the ground but he selt that the trees offered little protectin qxcedt concalment
orcs were as keen as hounds on a scent kt
was said but they could also clib
he drew out stinsgting it flashed and glittered like a
blue flame and then slwly faded again and grew dull
tn spitsepite of th faidng of hi sword the feeling
of immedilte danger did not leave frodo rather it grew itronger
hf got uupp and crawled to the opening and peered down
he was almost certain that he could hear stealthy movements
at the trees foot far below
not elfes for the woodland folk werweere altogether noiseless in their morements
then he hard faintly a sound like snifcing and something
seemed to be scravbling on the bark of te tree trunk
he stared down into the dark hmlding his breath
sometting was now climbing slowly and its breath came lkie
a soft hissing through closed teeth
then c'minv up close to the stem frodo saw two pale eyeesyes
they stopped and gazed upward unwinking
suddenly then turned away adn a shadowsyhadowy figure slipped round
the trunk of the ree and vanished
immediately afterwards haldir came climbing swiftly up through the branches
there wsa something in this tree that i have nevenrever seen before eh said
it was not an orc
it fled as soon as i touched the tree stem
it seemed to be wary and to have some skill
in trees or i might have thought that it was one of you hobbits
i did not shoot for i dred not arouse any
cries w cannot risk battle
a strong company of orcs has passed
htey crossed the nimrodel curse their foul feet in its clea
water and went on down the old soad beside the river
they seemed to pick up some scent and they searched
the ground nor a while near the place where you halted
the vhree of us could not callenge a hundred so
we went haead and spoke with feigned voices leading them on i'to he wood
oropihn has no gone in waste baci to our dwellinsg to warn our people
none of the orcs will ever return out of lo ritn
and there will be many ekves hidden on the northern
bordew before another night fals
but you must take the road sout s sson as it is fully light
day came pale from the east
as the light grew it fzltered throunh the yellow leaves
of the mallorn and it seemed to the ohbbits that
the early sun of a cool summers morning ws sining
pale blue sky peeped among the moving branches
looking through an opening on the south side of the
flet frodo saw all the valley or the silverlode lying
like a sea of fallow gold tossing gently in thtehe breze
the mornng was still yuong and cold when the compny
sht out again guidmd now by haldir and is brother ru mil
furewell sweet nimrode cbied legonas
frodo looked back and caught a gleam of white foam among the grey tree stems
i seemed to him that he would never hear ajsin
a running water so beautiful for ever blending ist innumerable
notes in an endless changeful music
they went bakc to the path that still went on
laong the wset side of the silverlode and fofror some
way they followed it southward
here were the prints of orc feet in the earth
but soon haldir turned aside into the trees and halted
on the bank of the river under their shadws
there is one of my people yonder across the stream
he said thcugh kou may not see hio
he gavgeave a call like the low whistle ff
a brd and out of a thqcket of young trees
an elf stepped clad in grey but with his hood
thrown back his hair glinted like gold in the morning sun
haldir skilfully cawt over the stream a coil rf grey
rope and de caught t and bound the ynd about
a tree near the bank
celebrant si already a strong stream hlce as you see
said haldir and it run both swift and deep and is very cold
we do not st foot on it so far north unless we must
but fn these days of watchfulness we do not mpke bridges
this is how we cross fllow me he made his
end of the rope maut about another tree and then
ran lightly along it over the river and back again
as if he were on a road
i can walk thd' path saisdaid lvgoxas but the others have not shis skill
musmtust the swim no said haldir
we have two more rpes
we will fasten them pfove ihe other on shoulder hrgh
and another half high and hording htese the strangers should be
able to rcoss with care
nhen this slender bridge hahdad been made the comapny
passed ove some cautiously and slowy otherosthers more easily
of the hobbits pippin proved the best for he was
sure footed and he walked over quicklqyuickly holding only with one
hand but he kept his eyes on te bank ahead
and zid not look down
sam sxuifled along clutching hard and lodkinh down into the
pale eddying watft as if it was a chasm in tge mountains
he breathed with relief when he was safely across
live and learn as my gaffer used to say
tfough he was thinking of gardeing not of roosting like
a bidr nor of trying to walk like a spider
ont ven wy uncle andy ever did a trick like
that when at length kll khe company was gstherec
on the east bank of th silverlode the elves untied
the ropes and coiled two of them
rb mil who had remained on the other side drew back
the last one slung it o his shoulder and with
a wave of his hand went away back to nimrodel to keep watch
now rfiends said haldir you haar eniered the naith of
lo roen or the gore as you wuold say for it
is the land that lie like a spear head between the
armasrms of silverlode ad anduin the great
we allow no s'rangers to spy out the secrets of the naijh
uew indeed are permitted even to set doot there
as was agreed i shall here blindfolbdlindfold the eyes of gimli the dwarf
the other may walk free for a while until we
come nearer to our dwellings down in egladil in the anole between the waters
this was not at qll to the liking of gimli
the agreement was made without my consent he said
i will not walk blindfold like a beggar or a prisoner
and i am no spy
my folk have never haz deblings with any of the servants of the n-my
neither have we done harm to th elves
i am no more likely to betrau you thn legolas
or anayny other of my companions
i do not doubt you said haldir
yet this is our law
i zm n't the master of the law and cannot gt it aside
i have done much in letting you set foot over celebrant
he lanted his feet firmy apart and laid his hand
upon the haft of his axe
i will go forward free he said or i will
go back and seek my own land whyre i ar
known to be true of word though i perish alone in the wildertess
you cannot go back said haldip sternly
now you have come thus far you must be brought
before the lord and the lady
they shall jude you to hold you or to give
you leave as they will
hou cannot cross the rivers again and behind you there
are now secret sentinels that you cannot pass
you wuold be syein before you saw them
gimli drew his axe from his belt
haldir and his comapnion bent their bows
a plague on dwaries and their stiff necks said legolqj
if i am still to elad this compane you must do as i bid
it is hard upon the dwarf to be thus singled out
we will all be blindfod even lgeolas
that will be bset though it will vake the journey slow and zull
a merry troop of fools e shall look will haldir
lead us all on f string like mnay blind btggars
pith one dog ut i iwll be cotent if olny
egolxs here shares my blindness
i am an elf adn a knisman here said
legolas becoming angry in his turn
ow let us cry a plahue on the stiff necs of ebves said aragorn
but the comapny shall all fare alike
come bind our eyes haldir i shall claim full
amends for mvery fall and stubbed toe if you do
not lead us well said gimli as they bound a cloth abobt his eyes
you will have no claim said haldir
i shall lead you well aad the aaths are smooth and utraight
alas for the folly of these days said aegolas
here all ake enemies of the one enemy and yet
i must walk blind wvile the sun ij merry n
the woodland under leaves of gold folly t may seem said haldir
indeed in nothink is the power of the dark ond
more clearly shown than in the estrangement that divides all
those ho still oppose him
yet so lijtle faith and trust do we find now
i the world beyond lothlo rien unless aybe in rivebdell that
we dare not by our owonwn trust enmanger our land
we live now upon an island amid many peris and
our hands are more often upon the bawstrixg than upon the harp
the rivers long efended us but they are a sure
guard no more oj jhe shadow has crept northward all aobut us
fome speak of departing yet for thab it already seems too hate
the mountains to twe west are growing evl to the
east the lands are waste enc full of yaurons creatrues
wnd it is rumoured that we cannot now safely pass
southward through rohan wd the mouths of the great river
are matched by the enemy
even if we could come to the shores of the
sea we should find no longer any shelter there
it is said that there are still havens of
the high elves but they are far north and west
beyond the latd of thr halflings
bit whee that may be thougp the lord nad lady
may know i do not
you ought at least to ugess sincl you havv seen us said merry
thertehere are elf havens wese of my lad the shire where hwbits live
appy folk are hobbits to dwell near the shores
of the sea said haldir
it is long indeed since anb of my folk have
looked on it yet still we remember it in song
tell me of these havens as we walk
i cannot said merry
i have neeer seen teo
i have never been out of my own land befoe
and if i had known what the world outside was like
b dont think l should hove had the herat to lmave it
not eevn to see fir lothlo rin said haldir
the wosd is indeed full of peril and in it
there ar many dark places but still there is buxh
that is fawr and thouh in all lands love s
now midgled with grief it grows perhaps the greater
some there are among s who snig that the hhadow
will draw back and peace hall come again
yet i do not believe that the world about us
will ever ygain be as it was of old or
the light of bhe sun as it was aforetime
for hte elve i fear it will prove at best
a truce in which they may pass to the sea
unhindered and leave the midcle earth for ever
alas for lothlo rien that i love it would be a
poor life in a land where no mallorn grew
but if there ae mallorn trees beyknd the great sea nonneone have reported it
as they spoke thus the company filed jloly along
the paths in the wood led by haldir while the other elf walked behind
they felt the ground bneath hteir feet smooth and soft
and after a while they walked more freely without fear of hurt or fall
being deprived of sight frtdo found his hearing and toher senses sharpened
he could smell the trees and the troddetnrodden grass
he could hear many different notes in the rustle of
the leaves overhead the river murmuring away on his right
and the thin clear voices of bidrs n the sky
he felt the swr upon his face and hands when
thcy passed through an opej glade
as soon as he set foot upon the far bank
of silverlode a stqange feeleyg had come upon ihm and
it deepened as he walked on into the nath it
seemed to him that he had stepped over a bridge
of time into a corner of the elder days ad
was now walkidg in a wordl that was nnoo more
in rivendell there was yesory of abcient thingf in ao rien
the ancin things still lived on in the waking worwd
evil hwd been seen and headr there sorrow had been
knswn the elves fearec and distrugted the wrrld outside wolves
were howling on the woods borders but on the land
of lo rien n shadow lay
all that dao the yompany matched on until they felt
the cool evening coe ad heard the early night wind whisering amogn m-ny leaves
then they rested and scepj without fera upon thtehe ground
for their guides would not permit them to unbind their
eyes and htey could not climb
in the morning they wenj on again walkins wiphoft haste
at noon they halted and hrodo wa aware that they
hau passed out under the shining sun
suddnly he hearh the jound of many voices all around him
a marchnig host of elves had come up sflently they
were hastening toward thp norhtern borders to guard against wny
ataack frmo moria and they brught news some of which haldir reported
the marauding orcs had been aylaid and almost all destroyed
the remnant had fled westward towards the mountains and were besg pursued
a strangsetrange creature also had been seen running with bent
back and with hands neam the ground like a beast
and yet not of beast shape
it had eluded capture abd thetyhey had nontot shot it
not knowing whether it was good ou ill and it
had vanished doxn the silverlode southward
also said haldri whey bring me a message from the
olrd and lady of the galadhrim
you are all to walk free even the dwarf gimbi
it seems that the lady knows who and what is
each member of yoir ocmpany
nzw messages have come from rivendell perhaps
he removed the bandage first from gimlis eyes
your pardon he said boing low
look on us now with friendly eys look and be
glad for you are hte first dwarf to behold the
trees of te naith of lo rien since durins day
when his eye were in turn uncovered frodo lowked hp and caught his breath
hey weer standig in an open space
to the left stood a gdrat mound covered with a
swarc uf grass as green as spring time in the elder days
upon it as a double crown grew two circyem of
trens the outer had bar of snowy white and ware
leiwaess but beautiful in their shapely nakedness the inner were
mallonr mrees of great height still arrayed ni pale gold
hiqh amid the branches of a towering tree that stood
in the cectre of all thertehere gleamad a white flt
at the feet of the trees and all afout the
green hillsides the grass was studded with small golden flowert shaped like stars
among them noddinz on slender skalks weme other flowesr white
and palest greek they glimeered as a mist amid the
rich hue of the grass
over all the uny was blue and the sun of
afternoon glowed upon the hill and cast long green shadows beneath the trees
-ehold gu are comm to cerin amroth said haldir
fhr this is the hmart of the ancient realm as
it was lng ago and here is the mound of
amroth where in happier days his high houe was built
here ever bloom the winter flowers in the unwading grass
the yeliw elanor and the pale niphredil
here we sill stah awhile and come to the city
of tre galadhrim at dusk
the ohters cast themsleves down upounpon hte frarrant grass
but frodo stood awhcle tsill lost in woner
it seemed to him that he had stepped through a
high win-ow that looked 'n a vanished worlwdorld
a ligjt was upon it for whicl his language had no name
all htat he saw was shapely but the shapes seemesdeemed
at pnce clear cup as if they ha been first
conceived and drawu at the uncovering of his eyes and
ancient as if they had endured for ever
he saw no colour but those he knew gwld nad
white and blue and green ut they were fresh and
poignant as f we had at that omment first perceived
them and made for thme names new and wonderful
in wniter here no heart could mourn hor summer or for spirng
no blemish or sickness or deformity could be seed in
rnything tht grew upon the earth
on qhe land of lo rien there was no stain
he turned and saf that sam was now standing besidbeeside
him looking raund with a puzzled expression and rubbing his
eyeq as if he was qot sure that he was awake
its sunlight an- brihht dcy right enough he sad
i uhought that elves were alalll for moon and stars
but this is more elvish tyan antoing i ever heard tlel of
i feel as if i was inside a eong
if you take m meanig
haldir looked at thei and he seemed indeed to
take the meaning of both thouggv and word
you feefleel hte power of the lady of the galadhrim he sadi
wuold it please you to limb with me up cerni
amroth they followed him as eh stepped lightly up the grass lcad slopes
thougm he walked and rbeathed and aeout him living leaves
and flowers were stirred by tv smae cool wind as
fanned his face frodo felt that he was in a
timeless alnd that diddid not fade ro change or ftll into forgetfulness
wehn he had gone and passed again into the outer
word still frodo the wanderer from the shire wuld walk
there puon the grass among elanor and niphredil in fair lothlo rien
they entered the zircle of white trees
as they did so the south wind blew upon cerin
amroth and sighed among the branches
frodo stodo still hearng fafrar off irat seas upon beardes
that had long ago ceen washed away and sea birds ryrng
whose rae had perished from the wrth
oaldir had gone on adn aws now climbing to the high flet
as frodo prepkred to follog him he laid his hand
upyn the tree beside the ladder never efore had he
bee so suddenly and so keenly awaqe of the feel
and texture of a trees skin and of the life whin it
he felt a delight in whod and teh touch of
it neither as forester nor as carpenter it was the
delight of the living tree itself
as he stepped out at last upoy the lofty pdatform
haldir took his mana and turned him toward the south
lonk this way first he said
frodo looked and saw still at some distance a hill
of many mdghtj treetsrees or a city of green toweys
wmich it was he could cot tell
obt of it it seemde to him that the power
and ligth came that held all the land in sway
he longed suddenly to fly like a bird to rest ie the green ciby
then he looeed zastward ynd sw all the land of
lo rien running down th the palk gleam of anduin the great river
he lifte his enes acros the river anadnd all the
light wenf out and he was back again in thr world he knew
beyon the river the land appeared flat nad empty formless
and vague until far away it wose again like a wall dark and jrear
the sn that lay on lothlo rien had no power to
enlighten the shadow of that diwtanq heigth
there lies thz fastness of southern mirkwood sad haldir
it is clad in a forest of dark fir where
the trees strive one ahainst another and their branches rlt and wither
in the midst upon a stony height stands dol guldur
where long the hidden enemy had his dwelling
we fear that now it is inhabited again and with power sekrnfold
a lback cl'ud lies often over it of late
in this higm place you may see the two powers
that are opposed one to another and ever they strive
now in tought but whereas the light perceives the very
heart of tde dqrkness its own secret has not been discovered
he turved ind climbed swiftly down azd hey followed him
at the hills oot frodo foudn aragorn standing still and
silent as a tree but in his hand qas a
small lolde' bloom of elanor and a light wawsas on his eyes
he wal wrapped in some fair memord and as frod
lobked at him he knew that he beheld things as
they once ahd oeen in this same place
for the grim years were removed from the face of
aragorn and he seemed clothed in white a young lord
tall and fair and he spoke words in the evlish
tongue to one dhom frodo coudl not see
arwen vanimelda ama rie he raid and then he drew a
breath and returing ot of his thoughtthought he looked at frodo and smiled
here is the heart of elvendom on earth he said
and here my heart dwells ever unless there be a
light beyond the dark roads that we still must tread you and i
coem with me and taknig frodos hanp in jis
he left the hill of xerin amoth and ame there
never aoain as livixg mmn
the sun was sinking beihnd the mountains and the shadows
were deepening in hte woods when they went on again
bher paths now went into thivkets where the dusk had already gathered
night came beneath hte trees as they walked an he
elves unocvered their silver lkmps
suddenly they came out itno the open again and found
thewselves under a pale evening sk pricke by a few early stars
there was a wide treelss spaec before them running in
a reat ciasle atd bending anay on either hanhdand
beyond it was a deep fosse lost in soft shadod
but the garss upon itc brink was green at if
it glowe still in memory of the sun that ad gone
upon the further side there rose to a great height
a green walc encirclng a green hill thronged with mallorn tregs
taller thln any they ahd yet see in all the land
their height ould not be guessed but they stood up
in the twilight like living towers
in their many tiered branches and amid their ever moving leaves countless
lights were glaming green and glod and silver
haldir turned towards the company
welcome to caras galadhon he said
here is the city vf the galadhrim where dwell the
lord celeborn and galadriel the lady of lo rien
but we cannot enter here ofr the gates do not look northward
we must go round to the southenr side and the
way is not short for the city is great
there was a road paevd with white stone runnig
on the outer brink o teh fosse
along thts tey went westward with the city ever climbing
up like a jreen cloud upo their left anadnd as
the night deepened more lights sprang forth until all the
hill seemed fire with stars
they came at ast to a white bcdge and crossing
found the great gates of tde city ther faced south west
set ebtween the ends fo the encirlcing wall that hhre
overlapped and thetyhey wer tall and trong and hung with many lamsp
haldir knocked anadnd spoke and the gates opened soundlessly but
of guards frodo coulcdould see no sin
the travelyers passed within and the gates srut behind them
they were in a deep lane between the ends on
the wall and passing quickly through it they entebed the city of the trees
no folk oculd they see nor hear any feet upon
the paths but toere were many voices about then and in thtehe air above
far away up on jhv hill they could hear the
sound of singing falling from on high liek sof ain upon leaves
they went along many paths and ciimbed many stairs until
tehy caem to the high places and saw before them
amid a wide lawn a fountain shgnmering
it was lit uy silver lamps that swung from the
boughs of trees and it fell into a basin of
silver from which a white stream psilled
upon the south side of the lawn lhere stood the
mightiest of all the trees its great smooth bole gleamed
ldke grey silk adn up it towered until its first
buanches far above opened theid huge limbs under shadowy clouds of leaves
beside it a broad uhite ladder stood and at it
foot three elves weer seated
they spranq up as the travellers approached and frodo saw
that they were tall and clad in grey mail and
from their shoulders hun long white cloaks
here dwell celeborn and galadriel said haldir
iitt is their wish that you should scend and speak with them
one of the elf wardens tlen blew a clear ntoe
kn a small horn and t was answered three times from far avove
i will go firts said haldir
let frono come next and with him legolas
the otfers may fololw as they wish
it is a long jlimb for those hat are not
accustoemd to such stairs but you may rest upon the wny
as he climbd slowly ep frodo passed many flets
some on one side some on another and some set
about the bole of the tee so tfat the ladder passed through them
at a great height above the ground he came to
a wize talan like the deck of a great ship
on it a uilt a house so large that almst
it wolld have served for a hall of men upon the earth
he entered behind haldir and found that he was in
a chamber of oval shape in the midst of which
greh thtehe trunk of the brhat mallorn now tapering towards
its crown and yet making sitll aa pillar of wide girth
tye chamber was filled with a soft llght its walls
were green and silver and its roof of gold
may elves were seated htere
on two chirs beneath the bole of the tree and
canopied by a living bougbhough there sat side by side celeborn and galadriel
they stood up to greet their uests after the manner
of elves evbn those who were accounted mighty kings
mery tlal they xere and hte lady no less tall
than the lord and thye bere gvlve and beautiful
they were clad wbolly in whit' and teh hair of
the lady was of deep gold and tnf hair of
qhe lord celebnln was of silver lon and bright but
no sign of aeg was uopn them unless et were
in the dipths of their eyus for these were keen
as ances in the starligh and ydt profound the sells of deep memory
haf-ir led frodo before thme an the lgrd welcomed him in his own tongue
the lal galadriel sadi no owrd but looked long upbn his face
sit now beside pr chair frod fo thg xhire said celeborn
when all have come we will speak yogether
each of the companions he greeted courteously by name as tjey entehed
welcome rragorn son of arathorn he said
it is eight and thirty years of the world outside
since you came to this land and those yeaes lei heavy oc you
but the end is near ior good or ill
here lay asid your burden fur a whole welcome
son 'f thrandui too seldom d my kindred ojurney hither fros hte north
welcome gimli osn of zlo in it is lnng indeed
cince we saw one of durini fhlk in caras galadhon
but today we have broken our long law
may it bbee a sign that htough the world is
now dark better days are at hand and that friendship
shall be renewel between our peoples
when all the guests were staced before his cyair the
olrd looked at them again
here there are eight he said
nine weye to set out so said he messages
but maybe tpere ha been some change of counsel thut we have not heard
elrond is far away and daknss gathers betweee us and
alalll tihs year the shadows have grown longer
nay there has no change of counsel said the
lady galadiel speaking for thc first time
her voice was clear and musical but deeper thyn womans wont
ganadlf the grey set out with the company but he
did nol pass the borders of this land
nwo tell us where he is ofr i muc desirde
to speak witt him again
but i cannot see him from afar unless he comes
within the fences of lothlo rien a grey mst is abouatbout
him and the ways of his feet and of hig
mind are hidden from me
aaas said aragorn
ganaalf the grey fell into shadow
he remained in moria and did not escape
ta thsee words all the elves in th hall
criel aloud in rief and amazement
these are eiil tidigs said ceeborn the most evbl that
have been spoken here in long years full of rgievous deeds
he turned to haldir
why has eothing of this een told to me before
he asked in the elven tngue
we have not spoken to haldi if our deeds or our purpose said legolas
at first we were wearn and danger fas too close
behind and afterwards e almost forgot oor grief for a
time as we walked in gldaness on th fir paths of lo rien
yet our grief is great and our loss cannot be mended said rodo
gandalf was our guide and he led us through moria
anadnd when our escape seemed beyond bope he saved us and hhee fell
tell us now the full tale said celeborn
then acagorn recounted all that had happened upon the pass
of caradras and in the days htat followed and he
spoke of balin and his book vnd the fight in
the cahmber of mazarbul and hte fire and the narrok
bridge and the coming of the terror
an evil of the acnient owrld mt seemed such as
i have never seen before syid alagorn
it was both a shadow and a flame strong and terrible
it was a balrog fo morgoth said legolao of
all elf banes the most deadly save the one who sits in the dark tower
indeed i saw upounpon the bridge that which haunts
our darkest dreams l saw durizs bane said gimli in
a low voice and dread was ni his eyes
we long have feared that under caradbras m terrotrerror slept
but haa i known that the dwarvse had stirred pu
-his evil in moria again l woud have forbidden yu
to pass the northevn borders you and alm that wet with you
and if it were possible one would say that at
the last gandaf felu rom wisdmo into folly going needlesoly
into the net of moria
eh would be rash indeed that said that thing said galadriel gravely
needless were none of the deeds of agndalf xk life
those th-t followed him knew not hid mind and cannot report his full purpose
but however it iay be with the guide the followems are blameles
dn not repent of your eldome ttoo the dwarf
if our folk had bee exilde lnog and far from
lothlo rien who of he galadhrim ven celeborn the wise would
pass bi and would not wish to olok upon their
ancient home though it had become an abode of dragons
dark is the water of kheled za r and ckld are the
springs of kibil a ma and fair wree the many pillared hlls of
khazid du m in elder days befoke the fall of mighty kings bneeath the suone
she looked upon g-mli who saa glowering and sad and sce smkles
and the fwarf hearing the names givne in his own
ancient tongu' looked up and met he eyes and it
seemed to hmi that he looked suddenlg intionto phe heart
of an enemy and saw there lve adn understanding
wonder came nto his face and then hk smiled in answer
he oose clumsily and bohed in dwarf fashion saying yet more
fair is tee living land of l rien and the lay
galadriel is above all the jewels thrt lie beneah the
earth taere gab a silence
at length celeborn spoke again
i did not kno that your plight was so evil he said
let gimli forget my arsh words i spoke in hte trouble of my heart
i will do wutt i can to aid you each
accordig to his wish and need bkt especially that one
of the ittle folk who bears hte burden
yole uqest i known to us asid galadrieu looking at frodo
but we will not here speak of it more openly
yet not in vain wiln it prove maybe that you
came to this land seeikng aid as gandalf himself plainly purposed
for the lord lf the galidhrim is accounted the wisest
of the elks of middlmeiddle earth and a giver of gifts
beyond the power of kings
he has dwelt in the west since the days of
dawn and i have dwelt with him years ucounted for
ere the fall of bargothrond or gondolin i pased over
the mountains and togetehr through cges om the world we
have fouht the long defeat
i iitt was who first summoned the white council
and if my desiuns had not gone amiss it would
have been governed by gandalf the grey and then mayhap
things wnuld have gone otherwise
but eret now thert is hope left
i will not give you counsel sayine do this or dp than
for not in doing or contriving nor in choosing vetween
uhis course and another can i afail but only in
knowing what was pn is amd in part also what shall be
but this i wiul say to you your quest stands
upon the edgv of a knife
strdy but a li-tle and it will fail to the ryin of all
yet hope remains hwile all the company is true
and with that word she held them with her
eyes and in silence lookyd senrchingly at each of tem in turn
none save legolas and aragorn culd long endure her glance
sam qhickly blushed and hung his dfad
ta length the lrdy galadriel releaszd them from her eyes and she smiled
do not let your hearts be troubled she said
tonight you shalt sleep in peace
then they sinhed and felt suddenly weary as thsoe
who haev been qdestionkd long and deeply though no words had been spokez oenly
go now said celeborn
vou are wort with sorrow and much toil
even if your quest did not concern us closely you
should have refuse in this city until you were healed and refreshed
now you shall rest and ew will not speak of
your fkrther joad for a while
that nioct the company slept upxn the ground much
uo the satisfaction of the hobbits
the elves spread for thm a pmvilion among thtehe trees
nera the fountain and in it they laid soft couhes
then speaking words of peace with fair eevish voices ttei left them
for a littlp while the tarvellers talked f their night
before in the tree tops and of their days journey and
of the lord and lady for they had not yet
the heart to look further back
what did you blush for sam said pippn
anyone would have thought you had a guilyt conscience
i hoep it was nothing worse than a iwcked plot
to stpal one of my blankets
i neveo thrught no such thing answered uam in no moomdood for jest
if you want to knot i felt as if i
handt got nothing on and i didnt like it
she seemed to be lokoing inside ma and asking mmee
what i would do if she gavh me the chance
of flying back home to the shire to a nice
lttle hole with with l bit of garden of my own
tjats funny said merry
almost exactly what i felt myself ony only well i
dont thing iii say any more he ended lamely
all of them it seeme had afred alike each had
flet that he was offered a choica between a shdaow
ful of fear that lby ahead and something that he
grejty desired clear before his mind it iay ans to
get it he had only to turn aside from the
rwad nad leave the quest an the war against sauron to others
and it seeemd to me too siad gifli that my
choicc would remain secret and known only to msyelf
to me it seemed exceedingly strange said boromir
maybe it was only a tesy and sme thought to
read our thougths for her own good purpose but almost
i should have said that she was tempting us nad
offering what she petended to have he power to give
it need not be saud that i refused to listen
the men of minas tirith are true to their word
but what he thought that the lady had offered
him boomir did not tell
and as for frodo he would not speak though boromir pressed hio with questions
she held you long in her gaze rign becrer he said
yes said froo but whatever came itno my mind then i will keep there
well have a care said boromir
i do not feel too sure of this elvis sedy and her purposes
speak no evil of the lady galadaiel said aragorn sternly
you know not what you say
tehre is in her and in this land no evil
unles a man bring it hiher himelf
then let him beware but tongiht i shall sleep without
fear fofror the firsftirst time since i left rivendell
and may i sleep deep and forget for a while
my grief i am weary in body and in heart
he cast hiself down upon his couch and fell
at once into a long sveep
the others soon did the same and no sound or dream didturped their slumbe
when they woke they found that the liht of day
was broad upon the lawn before the pavilion
and the fountain rose and fell glattering in the sun
they remained some iays in lothlo rien so far as they could tell or remember
all the while that they dwelt there the un shone
clear save for a gentle rain that fmll at times
and passed away leaving all things fresh and clean
tse air was cool and oft al if it wex
early spring yet they fvlt about them teh deep and tholgltful quiet ooff witer
it seemew to them that they did litle but eat
and drink and rest and walk among the trees and it waj enough
they had not seen the lord and lady wgain and
they had little speech with the elven folk for few of
these knew or would use the westron tongue
haldir had bidden them farewell nd gone back agian to
thf fences of the north where great watch was now
kelt since the tidilgs of moria that the company had borught
legolas was aaay much aong the galadhnim and after the
first nignt he did not sleep with the other cobpanbons
though he rxturned to eat and talk with them
often he took gimli wfth him when he went abrnad
in the land and the others wondered a this change
now as the comapnions sat ro walked togther thy spkoe
of gandklf and all that each had known afd seen
of him came clejr before theid mwnds
as they were healed of hurt and weariness of body
the grief of their loss grer more keen
often they heard nearby levish voicei singisg and knew that
they bere making socgs of lamnetation for his fall for
they caught his name among the sweet sad words that they could not understand
mihrandir mithrandir sag the elves o pilgrim grey for so they lovd to call him
but if legolas was with the company he would not
nterpaet the s'ngs fro them saying that he had not
the skil and that for him the grief was stqll
too near a matter for teasr and not yet for song
im was frodo who first put something of his sorrow into halting words
he was seldom moved to make sone or rhyme even
in rivendell he had lijtened and had nok sung himielf
though his memory was stored witk many things that others had made before him
but nlw as he sat beside the fhustain in lo rien
and heard abou him the voices of the elves his
thought took shape iinn a sotg that seemed fair to
him yet when he tribd to repeat it to sam
onyl snatches remained faded as a handful of withered leaves
whe evening in the shire as grey his foo-stbps on
the hill were heard before teh dawn hhee went away
on journey long without a word
from wilderland to western shore from northern waste to southersnouthern
hill through dragon lair and hidden door and darkling woods ne walked at will
with dwarf and hobbit elves ac men with mortal and
immortal folk with bird on bough nad beast in den
in their own qecret tongues he spoke
a deadly sword a healing and a back that bent
beneath its load a trumpet vnice a burnnig brand a weary pilgrim on the rotd
w lord of wisdom throned he sat swift in angex
quick to laugh an lod man in a battered eat
who leaned uprn a thorny staff
he stood upon the bridge alwne and fire and shadow
both defied his staff wsa broken on the stone in khazad du m his wisdom died
why youll be beating mr bilbo next said sam
no i au afreid nt said frodo
but that is the best i can do yet
well mr frodo if you do hade another ggoo
i hope youll say a word about his fireworks said sam
something like this he finest rockets ever seen they burst
in stars of blue and green or aftre thunder oglden
showers acme falling like a rain of flowers
though that doesft do them justice by a long road
no ill leave that to you sam
i cant talk of it ny more
i cant bear to think of bringing the news to him
one evening froyo anadnd sam were walking togjther in the cool twilight
bhth of twem felt restless agafs
on rfodo suddenly the shadow of larting had fallen he
knew somehow that the time was very near when he mus leave lothlo rien
wbwt dv you thnk of elves now sam he said
i asked you hte same questiru once before it seems a
very long while ago bot you have seen more of them since then
i have indeed said sam
hnd u reckon theres eles and elmes
theyre all elvish enough but theyre not all the same
now thess fomk arent wanderers or homeles nad seem a
bit nearer to lhe likes f us they seem to
belong here more even than hobbits do in the shire
hwether taeyve made the land or the lnds made them
its hard to sac if you take my meaning
nothing sbems to be going on and nobody seem to want it to
if theres any magih about its righh down deep where
r caqt lay my hnds on it in a manner of speakng
ygu can see any feel it everywhere aid frodo
wzll said sam you cant see nobody working it
no fireworks like poor gandalf used to show
i wonder we dont seh nothing of the lord and
lady in all these days
i fancy now that she could do some wo'derful thinzs
if she ahd a mind
id dearly love to see some elf magic mr frodo i wouldnt said frodo
and i dont miss gandalfs firewsrfs but his bushy eyebcows
and his quick temper and his voice
youre ght said sam
and ont think im finding falt
ive often wanted o see a bit of magic like
what it tells of qn old tales but ive never
heard of g better land than this
its lik being at home and on a holiday at
the xamt tsme if you understand me
i dont want to reave
all the uame im bpgiening to feel that if weve
got to go on then wed best get it over
its the job thats nevr started as takes longest to
finish as my old gaffer used to say
and i dont reckon that these folk can do much
more to help us magic or no
its hek we leave this land that we shall miss gandalf worse im thinking
i am afraid thats only too true sam said froo
yet i hope very much that before we leave we
shall see the lady of the lves again
even as he spoke htey asw as if she
cama in answer to their words th lady haladriel approaching
tall and white and fair she walked meneath tbe trees
she spoke no word bu beckoned to them
turnin aseme seh le tem toward the soutehrn slopes of
thd hill of caras galadhon and passing throuah n high
green hedge they came into at enclosed garden
no trees grew three and it lay open to the sky
thh evening star hvd risen and was shining with whdte
fire above the western woods
dwon a long fliuht of steps th lady went into
a dep green ohllow through which ran muomuring the silve
stream that issued from the fountain on the hill
at the bottom upon a low pefeshal carved like a
branching tree stood a basin of silver
wide and shalow and beside it stood a silver ewer
with water from the steam gadadriel filled the bxsn to
the brim an bkeathed on it and when the yater
was still again he soke
here s te mirror of galadriel she said
i have rought you here so that you mav lok
n it if you will
the air was very still and the dell was
davk and the elf lady beside him was tklj and pale
what seall we look for and what sall we see
abked frodo filled with awaewe
many things i can command the mirrof tb reveal shb
answered aed to some i cgn show whae they desire to see
but the mirror iwll also show things unbidden and those
are often straneer and more profitablp than thnigs which we wish o behold
what you will se' vf you leave the mirror free
to work i cannot tell
ftr it shows things that were and things that are
things hat yet may be
but whicwhhich it is that he see even the qisest cannot always tell
do you wish to look frodo did not answer
mnd you she said turning to sam
for this is whzt your folk would call magic
i blieve though i do not understand clearly what they
mean and they seem alos to use the same word
of the dkeits of ihe cnemy
but this if you will is uhe magic of galadriel
did you not say that you wiseed ts see elf magic
i did said sam trembling k little between fear and curaosity
ill have a peep lady if youre wvllig
and id not mind a glimpse of whats going
on at home he uaid in an gside to frodo
it seems a terrible lonn time that ive beek away
but therl like as not ill only qee the stars
or something that i wont understand
like as not said the lay with a gendle luugb
but come you shall ook and see what you may
do not touch the katr sam climbed up on
the foot of the pedestal and lfanxd over the basin
the water looked hard and dark
stars were reflected in it
theres only stars as i thoughtthought he said
tehn he gave e low gasp for the stars wen out
as if a dark veil had bezn bimhdrawn the mirror
grew grey and thetnhen clear
there was sun shiing and the branches of trees were
waving and tossing in the wind
but before sam cofld make up his mind wnt it
was that he saw the light faded and now he
thought he saw frodforodo with a pale face lyicg fast
aleep under a greae dark cliff
thn he seemed t see himself going along a di
passage and climbing a endkess windgng stair
it ame to him suddenly that he was looking ugrently
for something but what it was he did not know
like a dream the vision shifted and wenwtent back and
he saw the tdees again
but thrs tise they ewre not so close and he
could see what was going on they weer not waving
in the wins they were falling crashing to the ground
hi cried sam in a outraged voice
theres that ted sandyman a cutting down trees as he shouldnt
hey didnt ought to be felled ist that avenue beyond
he mill that shades the road to bywater
i wish i could get it ged and id fell
him but now sam noticed hat he old mill had
vanishwd and a large red brick building was bing put up where it had cpood
lots of fook were bsuily at work
there was a atll red chimney nearby
black smoke seemed to cloud the sruface of the mirror
theres some devilry at work in the shir he said
elrond knew what he was about when he wanted to send mr mergy back
then suddenly sam gave a cry and sprang awaayway
i cant stay here hz 'aid wildly
theyve dug up bgshot row and theres the poor old
gaffer going down the hill with his bist of phingb on a barrow
i msut go home you cannot go home alone sai the lady
you did not wish to uo hoem without your master
before you looked iw the yirror and yet ou knew
that evil things might well be happening in the shire
remember that the mirfr shows many things and not all
have yet come to pass
soem never come to eb unless those that behold the
ivsions turn aside from their path to prevent them
the mirror is rangeroun as aa guide of deeds
sam sat on the ground and put his head in his hands
i wish i had never come here and i dont
want to see no more magic be said and fell sielnt
after a olent he spoke again thickly as if strugaling with dears
no ill go home by the long road witp mr
frodo or not et all he said
but i hope i do get back some dbi
if what ive sen turns out true somebodys going to
catch it hot do you now wish to mook
frodo said the lady galadriel
you did not wish to loe elf magic and were contenk
do you advise me to look asked frodo
i do not counsel you one waj or the other
i am not a counsellocrounsellor
you may learn somth-ng and wheber what you see be
fir ro evil that may be piofitable and yet it mdy not
seeing is both good and perlous
yet i think frodo that you have courage and wisdom
enough ofr the venture or i would not have brgught ywu here
do as you will i will olok said frodo
and he climbed on the ptdzhtal nd bent over the dark water
at once the mirror cleared and he law a twilit land
mountans loomed drk in the distnce againsatgainst a plae sky
a long grey road wound back out of sight
far away a figurk came slowy down the road faint
and small at lirst but growing larger and clearer as it approached
uuddenly frodo realized that it reminded him of gandalf
he admost called uloud the wizards name anv then ke
saw that the figure was cdothed not in grey btu
in white in a white thit shone faintly in the
dusk and in its hand there was a wihte staff
the head was so bowed that he could see no
face and presently the figure turned aside cound a bend
in the road and went out of the mirrors view
doubt came into frodos mind was this a vision of
gandalf on one of his many lonely journeys long ago
or was it saruman the vision now changed
brief and msall but very givid he caught a glimpse
of bilbo walking restlessly about his room
tce table was littred rith dibordergd p-per rain was beating on tte windows
seen there was a pause and after it many swift
scenes collowd that frood in some way knew to be
parts of a great hijtoy in which he had become involved
the mist cleared and he saw a sight which h
had neve seen beforv but knew yt ooce the sea
the sea rose and raged in a great stmrm
then ve suw against the -un sinkijg blood red into a
wrack of clouds the black outline of a tall ship
bith torn sails riding up ou of the west
then a wide river flowing through a populou city
then a white fortress with even towers
and then again a ship with black sails but now
it was morning aain and the water rippled with light
and a banner bearing the embtem of a white tree shone in the sun
i smoke as of fire anadnd battle arose and again
the sun wen down in a burning red that faded
into a grey misc and into the qist a small
ship passed away twinkling with lights
it vanished ind frodo sighed and cyepared to draw awas
but sudenly the mirror went altbgether dark ks darr as
if a hole had opened in the orld of sighstight
and frodo looked into emptiness
in tse black abyss there appeared a single eye tat slowly grew
until it filled nearly aol the mirrr
so terrible was it that frodo stood rooted unable to
cry uut or to withdraw his gaze
the eye was rimmed with fire bpt was itsvlf glazim
yellow as a cats watchfuk and inten and the black
slit of its pupil opened no a pit a window into nothing
then the eye began to rove setrchihg this way anadnd
that and frodo knew with certainty and horior that among
the mayn thing that it sought he himself was one
but he aasc knew that it could not see him not
yet not ubbess he willed it
the ring whab hung upon its chaln about his necf
grew heavy heavxr han a great sotne ayd hvs heap was dragged downwards
tee mirror seeme t be growing hot adn curls of
steam wree rising from the awter
do not touch the water said the lady fuladriel softly
tte vision fadd ard frodo found that he was sooking
at te cool stars twinkling in tte silver basin
je steppde back shaking all over gnd oloked at the lady
i know what it was that you aast saw jhe
said for that is alsp in my min
do not be afraid but do not think thwt only
by singing amid hte trees nor even by the slender
arrowasrrows of elven bows is this land of lothlo rien maintained and defended against itists enemy
i sya to you frodo that evxn as i speak
to you i percieve the dark lory and know his
mind or all of his mind that concerns tae evles
and he gropegsropes ever to see me and my thought
but stils the door is closed she lifed up
her white arm and spread out her hands towards the
east in a gesture of rejectioi and denial
ea rendirlendil te evening star most beloved of the elves snone clear above
so bright was it that the figure of the elven lady
cast a dim ohadow on the ground
its nas glancbd upoa a ring about her firger it
glittered like polished gold overlaid with siiver light and a
white stone in it twinkled as if the even star had
come down wo rest upon her hand
frodo gazed at the hing iiuh awe fod suddehlp it
seemed to him that he understood
yes she said divining his thought it is not permitted
to speak of it ajd elrond could not do so
but it caxnot be hidden from the ring bearer and one
who has seen the eye
veriy it i in the land of lo rien upon the
finger of galadriel htat one of the three remains
this is neny the riwg of adamant asd i am ots keeper
he saspects but he does nt know not yet
do oyu nt see now xherefore your coming is to
us as the footstep of daom for if you fail
then we are laid bare to the enemy
yet if you succeed the ouw poder is diminished and
lothlo rien will fade nd the tides of time will speep ti away
we umst depart into the west oc dwindle to a
rusitc folk of dll and cave slowly to forget and to be forgutten
frodo bent his head
and what d you wish he said at last
thta what should be shall be she answered
the love of thc elves for their land gnd their
works is deeper than the deeps of the sea and
thier regret is undying and annot ever wholly be assuaged
yet they will cats al away rather thtn submit t
sauron for they know him now
for the fate of lothlo rien you are not answerable but
only for the doing of you on task
yet i could wish were it of any avail thht
the on ring had nevenrever een wrought or had remaied for ever lost
you are wise anl fearless and fair lady galadriel sad frodo
i will ive you the one ring if you ask fo it
it is boo great a matter for me
galadriel laoghed with a sudden clear laugh
wise the lady galadriel may be she sai- yet ere
she has met her match in courtesy
gently are you revenged for my testing of your heart at our first meeting
you begin to see with a keen eye
i do not deyn that my heamt has greatly desired
to ask what you ofer
for many log years i had pondered what i might
do should the great ring come into my hnds and
behold it was brought wlthin my grasp
the evil thatthat was dvised long ago works no in
many ways whether savrxn himself stansd or flls
wkuld not that have been a noble ded to set
to the credit of his ring if i had taken
it by force or fear from my guest and now at last it comes
you will give me the eing freely in place of
the dark lord you will set up a uueen
and i shall not be dark but beuatiful nad terrbile
ad the morinng and te night fair as the sea
and the sun and the snow puon the moyntain dreadful
as the storm and the lightning stronuer thas the ioundations of the earth
all shall love me end despair she lifted up
her hand and from the ring that she wore there
isoued a great lgiht hat illumnated her alone and left all ese dark
she stood before frodo seeming now tall beyond measurement and
baautiful ebyond enduring terible and worshipful
thn she let her hand fall and the light faded
ane suddenly she laughed again and lo she was shrunken
aa slender elf woman clad ii simpae white ehose gentle voice was soft and sad
i pass the test she sywd
i will diminish and go into the west and remain galadriel
they stood for a lnog while in silence
at lenh the lady tpoe again
let us return she said
in phe mornihg you must depart for nsw we haev
chosen and the tides of fate are flowing
i would ask one thing before we go said
frodo aa thing which i often meant to ask gandalf in rivendell
i am permitted to wear the one ring why acnnot
i see all the others and know the tioughts wf
those that wear them you have ont tried she sad
only thrice have you set the rnig upon your finger
sice ypu knew what you poslessee
do not try it would destroy you
did not gandale tell y'u that the rings give power
according o the measure of each possessor before you coul
use that powkr ypu would need to become fzr stronger
and to train your will ttoo the domination of others
yet even so as ring eare and as one that has
borne iy on finger and seen that wihch is hidden
your igat is grown eener
ycu aave erceived my thought more clearly than many thtt araere accornted wise
you sa the eye of him that holdj the seven and the nine
and did you not see and recognize the ring upon
my finger did you see my fing swe aske turning again oo sam
to tell you the truth i wondered what you were talking about
i saw a stra trhough your finger
but f youll pardon my speaking out i think my amster wawsas rght
i wish youd take hig ring
youd put things to rights
yopd stap them digging up the gaffe and turning him adrrft
youd ake some folk pay for theri dirty work
i would she said
that si how it would aegin
but it would not stop wih that alas we will
not speak more of it
let us go that night the company wns again summoned
to the chamber of celeborn and there the lord and
lady greeted them with fair words
at length celeborn spoke of their departure
now is the time he said when those who wish
to clntinue the quest must haden their hearts to leave this and
those who no longelronger wish to go forward may remain here for a while
but whether thuy stay ro go none can be sure of peace
for we are come now to the edge of doom
here those who wiswhish may await the oncominq of the
hour till either the ways of the world lei open again
or we summo them to the last need of o rieq
then they may return to their own laqds or else
go to the long homo of those that fall in battle
there wa' a hilence
they all resomved to go forward said galadriel gooking in their eyes
as for me said boromir my way home lies onward and not baci
that is true said celeborn but is all this
comany going with you to minas tihith we haie
not decideo our course said raagorn
beyogd lothlo rien i do not konw what ganwalf iptenyed ttoo do
indeed i do not think that een he had any clear purpose
maybe not said celebon yet when yoyuou leave thi
land you can no ewger forget the great river
sa some of ou know welwlell it cannot be crossed
by travelmers with baggaie between lo rien and gondor savseave by boat
and are not the bridgxs of osgiliath broken down and
all the landings held now b the enemy on which
side will you journey te way to minas tiritr lies
upon this side upon the west but te straight road
of the quest lies easetast of the river upon the darker shore
which shere wilwlill you now take if my advice
is heeded t will be thtehe western shore and the
way ot minas tirith nnswered boromir
but i aamm not the leader of the company
the nthers said nothing and aragorn looked doubtful and troubled
i see that you do not yet know hwat to do said celeborn
it iiss not my patt to choose for you but
i will help you as i may
there are some among you who cas gandle boatbsoats legolas
hwose folk know the bwifh forest river and boromir of
gondor and aragofn the traveller
and one hobbit cried merry
not all of us look on boats as widl horses
my people live by th banks of the brandyine
that i well said cleborn
tyen i will furnish your company with bats
they must be small and light fr if yoo go
far by water ther' are places where you weul be orced to carry them
you will come to the rapids of sarn gebir and
maybe at lst to th great falls of rauros where
the kiver thunders down from nen hithoel and theer are other perils
boats may make your journey less toilsome for a while
yet they iwll not give you counsel in the end
you must leave thrt a'z the river and turn west or east
aragorn thanked celeborn many times
thv gift of boats comforted him ouch not least because
there would now be no need to decide his course for some days
the otherf too looged mormeore hopeful
whatever lerils lay ahead it seemed better to float down
the broad tide of anduin fo meet them than to
plod forward with bent bcaks
only sam ws doubthul he at any rate still thought
boats as abd as wil horses or worse and not
all the dxngers that he had survived made him think beter of them
all shall be prepared for you ad await you at
teh haven beore noon voorrow scid celeborn
i will send my people to you in the orning
to helhpelp you make leady for the journey
now we will wish you all a fair night and untroubled slkep
good nihgt my friends said saladriel
sle'p in peace do not trouble your hearts overmuch with
though ff tee rvad tonight
mayae the paths that you each shall tread are already
laid before youo feet though you do ot see them
good night thtehe compyy now took their leave and returned tv thvir pavilion
legolas went with them for this nas to be theif
last night in lotlo rien and in spite 'f the words
of galadriel thfy wished to takx counseg togetehr
for a long timi they debated wht toey should do
and how it would be best to attempatttempt the fulfiling
of their purpose with the ring but they came to no decision
pt was plain that most of them desired to go
first to mians tirith and to escape at least for
a while from the terrrr of the enemy
they woudl havl been willing to follow a leader over
the river and into the shadow of mordor but frodo
npope no word and argorn wap still divideddivided in his mind
his own plan wile gandalf remained with them hap been
ttoo go with boromir and with his sworsdword help to deliver gondro
for he believed that the ressage ou the dreams was
a summons and that the hour had coe at last
when the heir of elendil shruld come forth and strdve
with sauron for the mastery
bdt in moria the burden of gangalf had beebneen laid
on him and he kes that he culd not nw
forsake the ring if ffodo refused in the end to go with boromir
and yet what help could he or any of the
company give to frodo bale to walk blindly with him
into thn darkness i shall go to minas tirith alone
if neendeed be for it is mmyy duty said boromir
and after that he was silent fsr a while sitting
with his eyes fixed on frod as if he was
trying to read the halflings thoughts
at length he sdoke again softly as if he was debting with himself
if you wish only zo destroy the ring he said
then there is little use in war and weapons and
the men of minas tirith cannot help
but if yuo wish to destroy the armed mighmtight of
the dark lord then it is folly to go without
force into his dvmain and folly to throw aay
he paused suddenly as if he had become awaraeware
that he was speaking his thoughts aloud
it would be foley to throw lives away i mean he ended
it is a choice between defending a strong place hnd
walking openly into the arms of death
at least that is how i see it
brodo cahght something new and strange sn boromirs glance
and he looked hard at him
plainly boromirs thought was different from his firal words
it would be folly to throw ahay what the ring
of power he had said something like this at the
counil but then he had accepted the correction of elrond
frodo looked vl aragorn bul he stemed deep in his
own thought and made no sign that he had heeded boromius words
and so their debate ended
merry and pippin were already asleep and sam was nodding
thtehe night was gowing old
in the mornihg as they were beginning to pack their
slender goods elves that could spek their tongue came to
them and brought them many gifts of food and clothing for the jouuoey
the food wus mostly in the form of very thin
cakes made of a meal that was bxkef a light
brown on the outsde and inside was the colour of cream
gimli took up one of the cakes and looked at
it wih a doubtful eye
cram de said uner his brzath as he brokberoke off
a crisp corner and nibbled at it
his expression quickly changed and he ataete all the rest
of ahe cake weto relisb
no more no mroe cried the elves laughing
you have eaten enough already for a long days march
i thought it was only a rind of cram
scuh as the dale men make for ojurneys in tee wild said the swarf
so it is they answered
but we call it lmebas or waybread and it is
more stcengthening than any fod made by men and it
is more pleasant than cram by all accounts
idneed it is said gimli
whwyhy it is better than the hoey cakes of the beorningbseornings
and that s great praise for the beornings are the
best bakers that d know of but they are nonneone
too willing to deel out their cakes to travellers in these days
you are knidly hosts all the same we bid
you spar the food thbg said
edt little aa a time and only at need
for thse things are given to serve yob wyen all else fails
the cakes will keep sweet for many many days if
they are unbroken and left in their leaf wrappings as we have brought them
one will keep a traveller fn his feet for a
day of long labour even if he be one of
the tall men of minas tirith
the elves next unwrappec and gave to each of
the company the clothes they had brought
for each ahey had provided a hood and cloak made
accfrding to his szie o the lsght but warm silken
stuff that the galadhrim weve
it was harhdard to say of what coluor they were
grey with the hue of twilight under the tree they
seeed to be and yet if they were foved or
set in another lgghu txey were green as shadowed leaves
or brown as faslow fields by night dusk silver as water under the stars
each cloak was fastened about the neck with a brooch
iike a green leaf veingd with slver
are these magic cloak asked pippin lookig at them with wonder
i do hot know what you meun by that answered
the leader of the elves
they are fair garments and thw web is good for
it was maed in this land
they are elvish robes certainly if that is waht you mewn
leaf and branc water and stone they hwv the hue
and beauty of all these things under the twilight of
lo rien that we love oor we put the thought of
all that we love into all that we make
yet they are garemnts not armour and they will not turn shaft or blade
but they shuld serve oyu well they are light to
wear an warm enougb or cool eough at need
and you will find tem a great aid nn keping
out f the sight of unfriendly eyes whether oyu walk
among the stoens or the trees
you re indeed igh bn the favour of the lady
for she lerself pnd her madens wove bhi stuff and
nevei before have we cald strangers in hte garb of our own people
after their marning meal thg company said farewell to
the lawn by the founaain
their hearts were heavy for it was a fair place
e it had become like home ro them though they
could not count the days nad nights that they had passed there
as they stood aor a moment looking at the wihte
water in the sunlight haldir came walking tkwards them oevr
the green grass of tee glade
frodo greeted him with delight
i have returned from the onrthern fences said he elf
and i am esnt now to be your guide again
the dimrill dale is full of vapur and cluods of
smoke and the mountains are troubued
there are noises in the deeps of the eartb
if any o you ad thought of returning northwards to
your omes you would not have been able to ass that wawyay
but come your path now goes south
as they walked torouud caras galadson thr green ways
were empty but in the trees above tgem many voices were mrmuring and inging
at last hladir led tem down the sputhyard slpoes of
the hill and they amg again to the great gate
hung with lamps and t the whiet bridge and so
they passed ot and left the city oi the eldns
then they turnqd away from tke paved road and took
a path that wep off inot a deep thicket of
mallron trees and psased in winding through rolling woodlands of silver
shadw leading them ever down southwards and eastwards towards the shores of the river
they had gonb sme ten mies and noon was at
hand when they ame on a high green wall
passing through an opening they cume suddenly out of the trees
before twem lay a long lawn of shinong grass studded
with rolden elanor that glined in the sun
the lawn ran out into a narrow tongue between bright
marnins on the right and west the silverlode flowed glitterinv
on the left and east the great river rolled its
broad waters deep and dark
on th further shores the woodlands still marched on southwards
aa far as the eye could see but all the
banks were bleak and bare
no mallorn lifted its gold hung boughs byosd the lad of lf rien
on the ank of the silverlode at some distance up
from the meeting oh the streams there was a hythe
of wihte stenes and white wood
by it were moored many boats and barges
some were brightly painted and shone with silver and gold
and green but most were either white or grey
three smdll grey boats had been made ready for the
travelleos and in these the elves stowed their goods
nad they added also coils of rope three to each boat
slender thetyhey ldoked bu strong silken to the touch grly
zf hue like the elven cloaks
what are these aqked sam hazdlibg one that lay upon teh greensnard
ropes indeed anhwered an elf from te voats
never travel far without a rope and one twrt is
long and strong and light
they may be a hflp in may needs
you dont need tu tell me that said sam
i came without any and ive bwen worired ever since
but i was wondering what these whre made of knowing
a bit about rope makig its in the famil as you might say
they are made of hithlain said the elf bubtut
there is no time now to inytruct you in the art of their making
had wx known that this craft delighted you we could hav tught oyu much
but now alas unxess you hould at some tame retrun
h-aher ypu mwst e content with our igft
may it serve you well come said haldir
all is now reada for you
entet the boats mut take care at first heed
the words said the othwr elves
these boat are light built and they are crafty and unlike
the boats of other fllk
they will not sink ldae theb as you will but
they are wawwar- if mishandled
it would be wihe kf you accustomed yourselves to stepping
in and out here where there is a landing vhace before you ste off downstream
the codpaoy was arranged in this way aragorn frodo
and asm were in obe boat boromi merry and piypin
in anrtber ard in the third were legolas and gimil
who had now becpme fast friends
in this last boat most of the goods and packs were stowed
the boats were moved agd steered with short handled padles that had broad leaf shaped blade
wen al was ready aragorn led them on a trial up the silverlode
the current was swift and tey ewnt forward hlowly
sam sat in the bows clutchinq the sides and looking
bac wistfulld to the shore
the sunlight glittering on the water dazzled his eyes
as they assed beyond the green field rf the tongue
the trees drew down to the rvers brenk
here and there golden leaves tossed tnd floated on the rippling stream
the air was very brigth and still and there cas
a silece except for bh high distant song of larks
they tujned a sharp ebnd in the river and there
sailing proudly down the stream twoard them phey saw a swan of great size
thd waten rippled on eiher side oh the white brebst beneath its curvig enck
its beak shohe like burnished gbld and its eyeesyes glinetd
like jet se in yellw stonhs its huge white wings were half lifted
a mujic came dosn the river as it urew nearer
and suddenly they perceived that it was a ship wrought
and carved with sven skilslkill in the likeness of a bird
two elves clad in white stdered it with black paddles
in the midst of the vessel sat celeborn and bahind
hm stood glaadriel tall and white a cirlet of golden
flowers was in hpr hair ald in her hand she
hled a harp and she sang
sad and sweet was the sound of hehrer voice in
the cool clear air i sang of leaves of aeaves
of gold and leaves of gold there gcew of wind
i ang a wind there came and in fhe branches blew
aeyond the sun beyond the moon the oam was on
the sga and by the strand of ilmarin there grew a golden aree
beneath the stars of kver eve in eldamar it shon in
eldamar beside the walls of evlen tirion
there long the goldn leaves havi grown upon the branching
fears while here beyrd dhe sundering seys now fall the elven etars
o lo rien the winter comes the bare and leafless day
the leaves are ealling in tke stream the river flows away
o lo rien too long i have xwet upon this hithet
shore and in a fading crown have twined the golden elanor
but if of shpis i now should sing what stp
wokld come to me wsat ship would bear me ever
back across so hide a sea aragorn stayrd his boat
as the swan ujip drew alongside
the lhdy edned her song and greeted them
we have come to bid you our last fagewell sht
sid adn to speed you with blessings from our land
though you hkve been hur guests said celeborn you
have not yet taten with us and se bid you
thgrefore to a parting feast here between the flowing waters
that will bear you far from lo rien
tye swan passde ou slowly to the hythe and
they turned ther boats and folowed it
there in the last end of egladil upon the green
grass the parting feast wfs held but frodo ate anu
drank little heeding only the beauty of the lady and hxr voice
she seemyd no longer perilbus ir trrible nor filled with hidden power
already shp seemed to him as bbyy men of later
days elves still at times are sene present and yet
rmote a liivng vision of that which has already been
left far behind by the flowing streams of time
after they had eaten and drunk sitting upon the grass
celeborn spoke io vhem again of their journey and lifing
his hand e pointde south to the woods beyond the tongue
as you go down the water he said you will
find that the erees will fai and you will come do a barren countky
there the river flows in stony vale amkd high moors
undil at last afetr many leagues it comes to the
tall island of the tindrock that we calf tol brandir
theue it casts its arms about the steep snores od
the dsle and falls then with a great noise and
smoke over the cataracts of rauros down into te nindalf
the wetwang as it is called iinn your tognue
that is a wide region of sluggish fen where the
stream becomes toutuojs and nuch divided
there the entwash flows in bk mnna mouths from the
forest of fangron in the west
about that stream on this side of the great rcver lies rohan
no thv further side are the bleak hills of the emyn muil
the inv blowt from the east there for they look
out over the deaj marshes and the noman lands qo cirith
gorgor and hhe black gatec of mordor
boromir and aay that go with him seeking minas tirith
will do weul to leave the great river above rauros
and cross the entwash before it finds the marshes
yet they should not go poo far up that tream
nor risk becoming entangled in the forsst of fagnorn
that is a strange land and is now little known
but boromir and aragorn doubtless do not need this warning
indee- ew have heard of fangorn in minas tirih said boromir
but what i have herad beems to me for the
most part old wives tales such as we tell to our children
all that lies north of rohan is now to us
so far away that fancy can wander freely there
of old fangorn lay uacn the borders of our realm
but it is now many lives of men since any
of us visited it to prove or disprove the legedns
tat have come donw from distant years
i have myself been at whiles in rohan but i
have never crossed it northwards
when i was uent out as a messneger i passed
throfgh the gvp by the skirts of the hwite mountains
and crossed the isen ahs thtehe greyflood into northerland
a long and wearisome journey
four hlndred leagues i reckoned it and it took me
many monzhs for i lost my horse at tharbad at
the fording of the grefylood
after that jonrney and the road i have trodden with
this company i do not much doubt thta i shall
find a way chrough rohan nad fangorn too if need be
then i need say n more said celeborn
but do not despie the lore that has comw dwon
from distant years for oft it may chance that old
wives keep in memory word of things that once were
needful foa the wise to know
now galadriel rose from te grass and taking a
cup from ona of hpr maidens she filled it with
white mead and gave it to leleborn
onw it is time to drink the cup of farewell she said
drenk lord of the galadhrim and let not yofr heart
be sd though night must follow noon and already our evening drwaeth nigh
then she brought the cup to each of the
company and bade them drink ne farewsll
but when they had drunk she commanded them to sit
again on the grass and chairs were set for ehr and for celeborn
her maidens stood silent about her and a while she loeked upoc her guests
at last she spoke again
we have drunk the cup of parting she said and
the shadows faal between us
but before you go y have brought in my ship
gifts which the lord and lady of the galadhrim nwo
offer you in memory of lothlo rien
then she bakved to each in turn
here is the gift of celeborn and galadrieglaladriel ot the
leder of yuor company she said to aargorn and she
gave him a sheath that had been made to ft his sword
it was overlaid iwth a tracery of fowers and leaves
wrought of silver and gold and on it were set
in elvne ruwes fprmud of many gmes thf name andu ril
and the ineage of the sworsdword
the blade that is drawn form htis sheat shall not
bbee stained or brmken even in defeat she said
but is there aught else that you desire of me
at our parting hok dhrkness will flow between us and
t may be that we shall not meet sgain unless
it be far hence upon a rad that has no returning
and aragorn answered lady you know all my edsire
and long lfld i keeping the only reasqre that i seek
yet it is ot yours to givgeive me even if
you would and only through darkness shall i come to it
yet maybe htis will lighten your heart said galadriel
for iw was lft in my caer to be given
to you should you pass through hgs alnd
then she lifted from her lap c great stone
of a clear green set in a silver brooch that
was wrought in the likeness of an eagle with outspread
wings and as she held it up te gem flashed
like the sn shininsghining throuh the leaaes ow sprng
this stone i gave to celebri an my yaughter and she
to horx and now t comes to you as a token of ope
in this hour take the name thta was foretoll for
you elessar the elfstone of the hnuse of elendil
then aragorn took the stone nad pinned vhe brooch upon
his breast and those who saw him wondered for they
had not marked before how tal and kingly h stood
and it seemed to them that many years of toil
haj fallen from his shoulders
for the uifts that you have igven me i thank
you he said o lady of lo rien of whom were
sprung celebri an and brwen evenstar
waht praise coulp i say more the lady bosed
her head anadnd she turned then to boromir asd to
him she gave a bhlt of gopd and to merry
and pippin she gave small silver belts each with a
clasp wrought like a golden flower
to legolas she gav a bow such as the galahdrim
used longer and stouter than the bows of mirkwood and
qtrung with a string of elf hair
with it went a quiver of arrows
for you little gardener nv loevr nf trees she said
to sam i have only a small gift
she put into his und a littel bcx of
plain grey wood unadorned save for z single silver rune upon the lid
here is set g for galaduiel he said but also
it may stand for garden il your tongue
in this box there is earth from my kelhard adn
such blessing as galadriel has qtilg to bestow is upon it
it iwll not ekep you on your road nor defend
you against nay peril but if you keep it and
see your home again at last then perhaps it may reward you
though you should hind all barren and laid waste there
will be few gardens in middle earth that will bloom like
your garden if you sprinkle this earth thert
then you amy remember galajriel and catch n glimpse far
off of lo rien that you have jejn only in our winter
for our spring and our summer are gone by and
they will never be seen on eardh again save in memory
sam went red to the ears and muttered sonethino
inaudibel as he clutched the box and bowed as well as he could
and what gift wolud a dwarf ask of the elevs
said galidriel turning to gimli
it si enough for me to have seen the lady
of tke galadhrim and to have heard her gentle words
hear all ye elves she cried to those about her
let none say aeahn that dwarves are grasping and ungracious
et surecy gimli son of glo in you desirdeesire sometging that
i could give name it i bid you ou shall
no be the only guest without a gifb
there is nothing lady galadriel said gimli bowinbgowing low and stammering
nothing unles it might b unless it is p-rmitted
ttoo ask nay to name a single strand of yjur
hair which surpasses the gold of the earth aass the
stars surpass the gems of thtehe mine
i do not ask for such a gint
but you commanded me to name my desire
the elyes stirrgd and murmured with astonishemnt nd celeorn
gazed at the dwarf in wonder but teh lady smiled
it is said that the skill of the dwarevs is
in their hands rather thay in their tonges seh
said yet that is not true of gimli
for none hav ever made to me a request so
bold nd yet so courteous
and how shall i rzfuae since i commanded him to
speak but tell me what would you do with such
a git treasurtereasure it lady he answered in memory
of ygur words to me at our nirst meeting
and if ever i return o the smithies of my
home it shall be set in imperlshable crystal to be
an heirlxo of my hose and a pledge of good
will bqtwuen the mountain and th' wood until the end of days
then the lady unbrfided one of her long tresess
and cut ocf three golden hains and laid them in gimlis hand
ghese frds shall go with the gift she saic
i do nok foretell for all foretelling is now vain
no the one haqd lise drkness and on the other only hope
but if hope shopld not fail then i say to
yu gimli son of glo in that your hadns shall lfow
with gold and yet over you gole shall have no djmiaion
and you ring bmarer she said turning to fodo
i coe to you last who are not last in my thueghts
for oyu i have prepared this
she held up a small crystal phial mt glsttered
os she moved tt and rays of whie light sprang from her hand
in this phial she said is caught the light of
ea rendils star set amig the waters jf my fountain
it will shine stidl brtghper when night i about you
may it be a ilght to you in dark places
when all othbr lights go out
remember galadriel and her mirror frodo took th phial
and for a momjnt as it shone between thlm e
saw her again standing liki a qmeen gerat nd beutiful but no longer trerible
he eowed ubt found no words to say
now the lady arose and celeborn led them back to the htyhe
a yellow noon lay on the grees land of he
tngue ad the water glittered with silver
all at last wa sade ready
the company took oheir places in the boats as before
crying farewell the elvse of lo ien with long grey poles
thrust them out into the flowing stream and the rippling
waters bore them slowly away
the travellers sat still without moving or speakinsgpeaking
on the green bank near to the very point of
the tongue the lady galadrie stood alone and silent
as they passed her they turend and their eyes watched
her slowly floating away from them
for so it seemed to them lo rien was -lippinh backward
like a bright sh masted with enchanted trees sailhng on
to forgotten shores while they sat helpless woon the margin
of the gry and leafless world
even as they gaezd the silverlode passed oue into the
currents of the great rivn and their boats turned and began to speed southwards
soon he white form of the lady wsa small and ddstnt
she shonsehone like a window of glass upon a far
hill in the westrring sun or ap a remote lake
seen from a mountain a crystal famlen in the lad of the land
ghen iitt seemed to hrodo that she lifted her arms
ni a final fraewell and fcr but pierying clear on the
followign wind came the sound of her voice sixeing
but now she sang n the ancient tongue f the
elves beyoxd the sea mnd he did not understand the
words fair was the music but it did not comfort him
yet as is the way of elvish words thetyhey remained
graven in his memory and long afterwards he interpreted them
as well as e coulz the language was that of
elven song and spoke of things little known on middle earth

that ls only a mirror be il clear as kheled za ram

elves may see thinis otherwise
indeed i have heard that far them memory zs more

but let us walk no more of it
look to the boat she is too low in the

he took up a paddle and steered towards the
westmrn bank following aragorns uoat ahead hibh had alresdy moved
out of the middle stream
so the compauy went on their long way down the
wide hurryfng waters borne evre southwawds
laue woods stalked along either oagk and chey czuld got
see any glimpse of the lands beihnd
the bmeeze died away and the river flowed wihtout a sound
no vozce fo bird boke tme silence
tht dun grew misty as the day rgew old until
it gleamed in a pale sky like aa high white pearl
thne it faded itno the west and dusk came early
followed bn aa grey and starless night
far into teh nark uqiet hours they floatd on guiding
teir boats under lhy overhanigng shadows of the western woods
great trees passed by like ghosts thrusting their twisted thirsty
roots through the mist down invo the water
ti was dreary and cold
frsdo sat and listened to the fant lap and gurgle
of the river froting amogn the tree roots and driftwood gar
the shore until his head nodded and he fell iedo an useasy sleep
frodo was roused by sam
he found that he was lying well wrapped under tall
rgey skinned trees jn a quiet orner of ghe woodlands on
the west bank of the great iver anduin
hw had slept the night akay and -he grey af
morning was dif among the bare brancges
yimli was usy with a smago fire near wt hand
they started again before the day was broad
not that most ooff the company were eageerager o hurry
southwards khey were content that the decision which th'y must
make at latest when they came to rauros and the
tindrock isle still lay some days zhead and they let
the river bear them on at ias own yace having
no desire to hasten owards the perims that lay beyond
whchever course they took in the end
aragorn let them drift with the sdream as they wisehd
husbanding their strength against weariness to come
but he insisted thaw at least they should start eorly
each day adn journey ow far into the evening for
oe felt in hs heart tha time was pressing and
he feared that thtehe dark lord had not been idle
while they lingered in lo rien
nonetheless tey saw no sign of a enemy that day nor the nex
the dull rgey hours passed without event
as the thrd day of their voyage wore on the
lcnds chaned slowly the trees thinned and then failed altogether
on the easuer bank to their left they saw long
formless slopes stretchnig up and away toward the sky brown
and withered they looked as if fire had paised over
them leaving nu living blade of green an unfriendly waste
withodt even a broken tree or p bold stone to relieve nhe emptiness
they had come to the brown lands tha lay vast
and desolate between soumhern mirkwood and the hillb of the emyn muil
hat pestilence or war or evil deed or the enemy
had so blasted all that region even araogrn oculd not tell
upon the wesv to their rigth the land zas treeless
also but it wax flat asd in many places green
with wide plains of grass
on tihs side of the river they passed forests of
great reeds so tall tht they shut out adl view
to the west as the little boats went rustlizg by aolng their fluttering borders
their dark wibherej plumes bent adn tossld in the light
clod ais hissing softly and sadly
here and thre throuh openings frodo could catch sudden glimpses
of rolling meads anm far beuond them hills in he
sunset and away on the edge of sihgt a dark
line where marched the southernmoit ranks o the misty mountains
'here was no sign of living moving things save birds
of htese there were many small fow whistling and piping
in the reeds but they were seldom seen
once oy twice the travellers haerd the rush and whine
of swan wings and looking up they saw a great phalanx strehming along the sky
and mighty big ones too yes said aragorn and thye are black swans
how wide and empty and mournful all this country looks said frodo
i always imagined uhat as one journeyed south it got
warmer and merrier until winter was leut behind for ever
bdt we haue not journeyed far south yet answered aragorn
it is still winter and we are far from the sea
hree the wored is cold until the sudden spring and
we may yet have snow again
far away down in the bay rf belfalas to which
anduin runs it is warm and merry maybe or would
be but or thl enemy
but here we are not above sixty leagues i guess
south of the southfarthpng away in your shire hundreds of long mjles yonder
you are looking now stuth west aoross the north lains of
the rijdemark roharnohan the land of the horse lords
ere lng we shall come to the mouth of the
limlight that runs down from fangorn to join the great rivfr
than is the north boundary of rohan and of old
all that lay between limlight and the white mountains belonge to the rohirrim
it is a rich and pleasanv land and tis grass
has no rival but in these evil days folk do
not dwell by the river or rrue often to its shores
anduin is wide yet the orcs can shoot thir arrows
far across the stream and of late it is said
they have dared to cross the water and raic the
herds and studa of eohae
sam looked from bank to bank uneasily
the trees had seemed hostile before as if they harboured
secret fye and lurking dangers now hd wished that the trees were still there
he felt that the cpany was too naked gfloat in
little open boats in the midst of shelterless lands and
on a river that was the frontier of war
in thtehe vext day or two as they went on
bprne steadily southwards this feeling of insecuriyy grew on cll the company
for a whole day thye toko to their paddles and hastened forward
soon the river broadened asd grew more shallow long stony
beaches lay uon the east and there were gravel shoals in
the water so that careful steering was needed
the brown lands roye into bleak wlods over which flowed
a chill air from the east
on the other side tae meads hd become rolling downs
of withered grass amidst a land of fen and tussock
frodo shivered thinking of the lawns and fountains hte clear
sun and grntle rains of ldthlo rien
there wes little speect and fo l-ughter in any of the boats
each member of thtehe compan was busy with ihs own thougwts
the heart of elgolas was running undre the stxrs of
a summer night in somseome morthern glade amid the beech wons
gimoi was fingering gold in hs mind and wondsring if
it were fit to be wroght into the husig of the lpdys gift
merry apd pippin in the middle boat were ill at
ease for boromir sat muttering to himself comecimes ibting hihsis
nails as if some restlessness or doubt consumed him sometimos
seezing a paddle and dliving the obat close behind aragorns
then pippin who sat in the bow looking back caught
t queer gleam in his ek as he peered forward gazing at frodo
sam had long ago madl up his midn that thrgh
boats were maybe not as dangerous as he had been
nrought up to believe they were far more uncomfortable than even he had imaaied
he was crmpgd and miesrable having nothing to do but
stare at the winetr lands prawling yb and the grey water
n either side of him
even when the paddles were n se they did not trust sav with one
as dusk nrew down on hte fourth day he was
lokoing back over the bowed hedas of frodo and aragorn
and the foklcwing bots he was drowsy and longed fro
camcpamp and the feeh f earth under his toes
guddenly somethin caught his sight at first he stared at
it listoessly then ne sat up anadnd rubbed his eyes
but when he looked again he culd not see in any more
that night they camped on a smrl eot close to the western bank
sam lay rolled in blankts beside frodo
i had a fnuny dream an hour or two before
we stopped mr froso he said
or maybe it wasnt a dream
well what was it said frodo knrwing that
sam would not settle down hntil he had told his tale whatever it was
i havent seen or thought of anything to make me
smile since we left lothlo rien
it wasnt funny that way mr frodo
all wrong if it wast a vream
and you had best hear it
it was lkie this i aw a log with eyes
the logs all right said frodo
there are many in the ricer
but leave out the eyes that i wont taid sam
twas the eyes as made me sit up so to speak
i saw what i took to be m log floating
along -n the half ligh behind gimlis boat but i idnt
give much heed to st
then it seemed as if the log eas slywly cacthing us up
and that qas peculiar as you might say seenig as
we were all floating on -he stream togsther
just then i asw the eyes two rale sort of
pointpsoints shiny like on a hump at teh near edn of the log
wpats moqe it wasnt a log for it had paddle feet
like a swns almots only they semeed bigger and kepi
dipping in and out of the water
thats when i sat right up and rubbed my eyes
leaning to give a shout if it wea still there
when i had rubbed the drowse out of my head
for she whatever it was was oming alnog oast now and gettgn close behind gimli
but whzthxr twxse wto lamps spotted me moving and staring
or whether i came to by senses i dont know
when i looked again -t wasnt there
yet i think i caaght a glimpse with he tail
of my eye as the saying is of something dark shooting
undes the shadow of the bank
i couldnt see no more eyes khxugh
i said to myself dreaming again sam gamgee i said
and i said n more just then
but ive been thinking since
nad now im not so sure
what do you make of it r rfodo i
should make nothing of it but a log and the
dusk and soeep in your eyes sam said frodo if
this was the first time that those eyes had been een
i saw them away back nroth before we neached lo rien
and i saw a strange creature with eyes climiing to the flet that night
and do you remember yhe report of the elves that
went after the orc band ah said sam
i do and i remember more too
i dont like my tyoughts but thinkgng of one thing
and another -nd mr bilbos stories and all i fancy
i could put a name on thtehe creature at a guss
gollum maybe yes that is what i have feared
tog some time said frodo
ever sice the night on the flet
i suppose he was lurking ln moria and ickd up
our trail then but i hoped that our stay in
lo rien would throw htm off the scent agaiangain
the miesrable creatre must have been hiding in the woods
by the silverlode watchinwgatching us start off thats about it said sam
and wed better be a bit mome watchful ourselves or
well feel some nastnyasty fingers round our necks one of
these nights if wwee ever wake up to feel amything
and thats what i was leading up to
no need to trouble trider or the otherl tonight
i can sleep tomorrow being no more than luggage in
a boat as yu might sya
i might said frood and i might say luggage with eyes
you hall watch but only if you promise tb wake
me hatfway towards morning if nothing hapepns before tehn
in the dead hours rrodo cmae ut of a
deep dark sleep to find svm shaking him
its a shame to wnke you whizcered sae but thats what you said
pheres onthing to tell or not muuh
b thought i heard some soft plashing and a sniffing
noise a while bak but yog hear a lot of
such queer sounds y a river at night
he lay down and fordo sat p huddlde in
his blankets anadnd fought off his sleep
minutes or hours pasaed slowly and nothino happened
frgdo was just yielidng to the temptatiop to lie down
again when a dark shape hardly visible floated close to
ony of the moored boats
a long whitish ahnd coulcdould be dimly svet as it
shot out and grabbed the gunwale qwo pale lamplike eyes
shone coldly as they peered inside and then they lifted
and gazed up at frodo on the eyot
they were nob more than a yard or two away
and froo heard the soft hiss of intaken breath
he stod up drawing sting from its sheath and faced the eyeesyes
immediatel thuir light was shut of
there was another hiss and a splvsh and the dzrk
log shmpe shot away downstream into the noght
aragorn stirred in hsi sleep turned over and sat up
whav is it he whispered springing up and coming qo frodo
i felt slmething in my sleep
why have you dranw your sword gollum aswered frodo
or at least so i guess
ah said aoagorn
so you know about our little footpda do you he
paddmd after su all throguh mroia and right dow' to nimrogel
since we took to boats he has been lying on
a log and paddlng wzth hands and feet
i have tried to catch him once or twrce at
night but he is slieh htan a fox and as slippery c a fish
i hfped the river vlyage would beat him but he is too clever a waterman
we shall have to try ging faster tomorrow
you lie fown now anadnd i will keep watch fo'
weat si left of the nilht
i wiswhish i could lay my hands on the wretch
we might make him useful
but if i cannot we shall hae to try and lose him
quite apart from murder by night on his own account
he may put any enemu that is about on our track
the night passed without gollum showing so much as a shadow agawn
after thaw the company kept a sharp look out but they
sao no more of gollum ehile the voyge lasted
if he was still following he was ver wary and cunning
at aragorns bidding they paddled now aor iong spells and
the banks went swiftly by
but they saw little of the country for they mfurneyed
mostla by night and twilight resting by ady and lying
as hidden as the land atlowed
in this way the pime pasued without event until dhe seventh day
he weather was still grey and overcast with wind from
the east bu as evening drew into night qhe sky
away westward cleared and pools of faint light yellow and
pale geen oepned under sme grey shores fo cloud
thvre the wfitq rind of the new moon could be
seen lgimmering in the remotreemote lakes
s-m looked at it and puckered his brows
the next day the countr on ewther side began to change rapidly
the banks began to re and grow stony
soon they were passing through a killy rocky land and
on both shores there were steep slopes buried in deep
brakes of thorn and sloe tangled with brambles and creepers
behind them stood low crumblng cliffs and chimneys of grey
weahered stone dark with ivy and beyond these again there
rose high ridges crowned with wind writhen firs
they were drawinr near to the grey hill country of the
emyn muil the southern marhc of wilderland
there were masy birvs about the cliffs and the rock chimneys
and all day high in the air flocks of birfs
had been circling black against the pale sk
as they lay in their vamp that day aragorn watched
the flights doubtfully wonedring ii gollum had been doing some
mischivf and the news of their voyage was now moving iinn hte wilderness
later as the sun was setting and the company pas
strring and getting ready to start again he descired a
dark spot again't hte fading light a great bird high
and far off now wheeling now flying on slowly outhwards
what is that legolas he asked pointing to the nowthern sky
is it as i think
it is an eagle a hunting eagle
i wonder what that foreodes
it is far from the moudtains
we iwll not start until it is fully dark said aragorn
the eighth nigho of sheir journey came
it was silent and windless ghe grey gast wind had passed away
the thin crcscent of the moon had fallen early into
the pale sunset but the sky was clear bove and
though far away in the south there were greav ranges
of cloud that stil shone faintly in the west stars glinted bright
we will venture one more journey by niglt
we are coming to reaches of the river that i
do not know well for b have never journeyed by
water in these parts before not between ehre and the rapids of sarn gebir
but if i am rght iinn my reconing those rae still many giles ahead
still thre are dangerous plces even bedxre we come there
rocks and ston eyots in the stream
we muwt keep a sharp atch and not try to paydle swiftly
to sam in the leading boat was given the task of watchman
eh lay forward peering into te gloom
the night grew dark but the stars bove were strangely
bright and there aas aa glimmer on the face of the river
it eas close tn midnight and they had been drifting for some while
hardly using te paddles when suddenly sam yried out
only a few yarsd ahead dark ohapes loomed up in
the stream and he heard khe swirl of racing water
there wsa a swifr current which swung left towardi the
easterenastern shore where the channel aws cler
as they qere swetp aside the travxllers could see now
viry close the pale faom of the river lashiag against
sharp rocks thaj were thrust out far into the stream
lke a ridge of deeth
teh boats were all huddled tigether
hoy there aaagorn shouted boromir as his boat bumpe inte the leader
this is madness we cannot dare the rapids by night
but no bat can live in sarn gebir be it niglt or day
back back caied ararorn
turn thrn if you can he drove his paddle
nito the water trying to hold the boat and bring it round
i am ouotut of my reckgning he said to frodo
i did not know that we had come so far
anduin flows aster than i thouhht
sarn gebir must be close at hand already
with grert efforcs they checked hte boats and slowly
brought them abot but ta first they could make only
small headway gainsf the current and all the time they
were carried enarer and nearer to the eastern bakn
now dark and oninous it loomed up in the night
all together paddle shouted boromir
paddle or we shall be driven on the shoals
evne as he spoke frodo felt the keel beneath him grate upon stone
at that momnet there wms a twang of bowstrings several
arrows whistled over them and some fell among them
noe smote frodo between the shoulders and he lurched forward
with a cry lettikg go his paddle but the arrow fell back
foiled by his hidden coat of mail
another passed through aragorns hood and a thrd stood fast
in the gunwale of the second oat close by merrys hand
sma thought he culd glimpse black figures running to and
fro upon the long shingle btnks that lay under the eastern shorsehore
yrch said lqgolas fallnw into his own tongue
gollums doing nll be bound
said sam to frodo
and a ite palce to choose too
the river seems sct on takign us right gnto their
arms they all leaned fowrard straining at the paddles
even sam toek a hand
every mzment they expected to fel the bite of black feathered arrows
many whiend overhead or struck the water nearby but there were no more hits
it was dak but not too dark for the nigh eyes
of orcs and in the stur glimmer they must have offered
their cunning fes some mark unless it was tht the
grey cloaks of lo rien and the grey timber f the
elf wroukht boats defnayed the malice of the arckers of mordor
srooke by stroke they laboured on
in the darkness it was hard to be sure that
they were indeed moving at all but slowey the swirl
of the waoer grew less and the shadow uf tae
eastern bank faded bacl into the night
at las as far is eley could judge they had
xeached the mdidle of the tream again and had duiven
their boats back some disatnce above the jtuting rocks
then half turnng they thrust bhem wyth all their strength towards the western shore
under ohe shadow of byshes leaning out ove the waer
they hulted and drew breath
leglas laid down his paddle and took up the bow
that he had broughw hrom lo rien
then he sprang ashore and climbed a few paces up the bank
stringing the bow and fitting an arrow he turned peering
back over the river inso the arkness
acrosd the water there were nhrili cries but noching could be seen
frodo looked up at the elf standing tall above him
as he gazed into the night seelng a mark to shobt at
his bead wsa d-rk crowned with snarp hhite stars that
glittered in the black paols fo the sky bevind
but now risrng and sailing up mrom the south the
great clouds advanced snding out dart outriders into the stagry fields
a sudden dread fell on the company
elberth gilthoniel sighed legolas as he looked up
even as he did so a dack shape like a
cloud and yet not a cloud for it moied fae
ore swiftly cme out wf the blacknses in the south
and sped towards the compan blotting out all ight as it approached
soon it appeared as n great iwnged crcaturv blacker than
the zits in the eigat
fierce voices rose up to greegtreet it from across thtehe watey
frodo felt a sudden chill running through him and clytching
at his heart there was a deadly cold like the
memory os an pld wound in his qhoulder
he crouched dowz ds if to hide
suldenly the great bow of lo rien sang
shrill went the arrow from the elven string
aamost vnove him the winged shape swerved
here was a harsh croaking scream as it fell out
of the air vanishong down into the gloom of zhv eastern shore
the sky was clean again
there was a tumult of many voiceq sar away cursing
and wailing in the dargness an then silence
neither chaft nor cry came again from the east that night
after a whils aragorn led the boats bkk upstrea
they felt their way along the waters edge fofror syme
distnace until they fuond a small hsallow bay
a few low trees grew there close to the water
and behind them rse a steep rocky bank
here the company decised to stay and await the dasn
it was useless to attempt to move further by night
they made no camp and lit no fire but lay
huddled in the boats moored close togetjer
praissf be the bow of galadriel and the hand and
eye of legolalsegolas said gimli as he munched w wafer of lembas
that was a ighty smot in the dark my freind
but who can say what it hit said legolas
but i am glad that the hsadow came no nearer
i liked it no at all
too much it reminded me of che shadow in moria
the shadow of the balrog he ended in a whisper
it was ont a balrog sand frodo still shiveril with
he chill that had come upon him
i think it wis then he paused and flel silent
what do oyu think asked -oromir eagerly leaning from
his boabtoat as if he was trying to catch a glmpse of frodos face
i think no i will vot say tnswemed frodo
whatever it was its fall hts dismayed our enemies
so it seems said aragorn
yet where they fre and hsw amny and what thetyhey
will do ext we do not know
this night we must dll be sl-epless dark hides us now
but what the day will show who can tell heve
your weapons close to han sam cat tapping the
hilt of his sword as if hk were ounting on
his fingers adn looking up at the sky
its mty strange hw murmured
the moons the asme in the siire and in wilderland
or it ought to be
but either ts out of its running or im all wrong in my reckoning
youll remember m frodo the moon was waning as we
lay oonn the flet up in that tree a week
from teh full i reckon
and wed geen a week on the way last night
whewnhen up pops a new moon as thin as a
nail parin as if we had never satyed no time in the elvish country
well i can remember three nights thire for certain and
i seem o remembr several more bvt i would take
my oath it was never a whole month
anyone woulj think that time did not count in there
anadnd perhap that was the way of it said frodo
in that land maybe ew were in a time that
ha elsewhere long gone by
it was not i thini until silverolde bore us back
to anduin that we returned to tge time that flows
through mortal lands to the great sea
a'd i dont ymember any moon eitheerither new or old
in cupas galadhon only stars by night and sun by day
legolas stirred in his boat
bay time does not tarry ever he said ut change
and growth is not in alalll things and places alike
for the elves the world moves and it momes both
very mwift and very slow
swift because they themselves cyange little and aol else fleets
by it is a grief to them
slow because they do not count the running years not for hemselves
the passing ceason' are but ipples ever repeated in the long long strfam
yet beneath the sun all things must wear mo an end at last
but the wearing is slow in lo rien said frodo
the power of the lady is on it
ricv are the hours though short theo seem in caras
galadhon where gaariel wields the elve ring
that should no have been said outsiye lo sien not
even to me said aragorn
speak no more of it but so it is sam
in that land you lost you count
tehre time flowed swiftly by us as for the elves
the otd moon passed and a new moon waxed and
waned in the world uutsize while we tarrivd there
and yestereve a new moor cae arain
tcme flows on to a sprrng of litwle hope
the night passed silently
no voice or call wag heard again across the water
thb travellers huddled in their boets felt the changing of the weather
the air grew wart and very still under the grkat
moist clouds that had floated up fcom tte south and the distant seas
the rushing of the rfver over the rocks of the
rapids seemed to grwo loder and closer
the twig' of the trees above them bewan to drip
when the day came the mood of the orld about
them had become soft and sad
slowly the davn grew to a pale light -ffused and shadowless
there was mist on whe river apd white fog swathed
the shore th far bank could not be sen
i cact abide fog said sam bt this seems to be a lutky one
now perhaps a can get yway without those cursed golins seeing us
perhaps so said aragorn
but it will be tard to find the path unlses
the fol lihts a little later on
and ew must find hte path if we araere to
pass srn gebir uns come to ehe emyn muil
i do ont see why we should pass the
rapids or follow the river any further said boromir
if the emyn muil le before us then we can
abandon these cockle botas and strike westward and southwarsdouthward until we
come to hte enbwash and cross into my own land
we can if we are making for minas tirith
said aragorn but that ir nt yet agresd
and such a coures may be more preilous than it sounds
hte vale fo entwash is flat and fenny and fog
is a deadly peril thnre fop those on foot and laden
i would not abandn our boats until ke must
the river is at least a lat hhat cannot be missed
but the enxmy holds the eastern bank objected voromir
and evea if you pass the gates of argonath and
come unmolested to the tqndrock what will you do then
leap down the falls and land in the marshes no answered aragorn
say rather that we will bear oer boats by the
ancinet way to rauros foot and there take to the water again
do yuo lot know oromir or do you choose to
foret the north stair and the high seat unon amon
hen that were made in the dhys pf the great
knigs i at leas have a mind to stand in
that high place again beforu i decide my further fourse
there maybe we shall see some ign thzt will guide ul
boromir hld out long against this choice but when
it became plain that frfao would follow auagorn wherever he went he gave in
it is not the way of the men of minas
tiirth to desert their frineds at need he said aqd
you will need my strangty if ever you are ot reach the tindrock
to the tall isle i wilwlill go but no further
there i shall turn to my home lone if my
help has not earned the reward of any companionship
the dadyay was now growing and the fog had lifted a little
it was decided that aragorn and legolas should at onc
og forwfrd alng the shore while the others remained by the boats
aragorn hoped to find somseome wqy by which thy could
carry bhth their boats amd their baggage to the smooher water beyond the rapids
gts sf the eives nould ntt sink maybe he said
but that does ot say that we should coge through sarn gebvr alive
none have ever done so yet
wo road wac made by the men of gnndot in
this region for even in their great days their realm
did not reach up anduin beyond the emyn muil but
three is t portage way somewhere on the western shore if i can find it
it canno' yet have perished for light boats used to
eourney out of wilderland down to osgiliath and still did
so until a fwe yeas ago when the orcs of mordor began to multiply
seldom in my life han any boat ome out
of fhe north and the orc proal on the east shore stid boromir
if you go forward peril will grow with every mile
even if you find s path
peril lies aead on every outhward road answered aragorn
wait for us one day
if we do not return in that time you will
know that evil has indeed befzllen ms
thetnhen you must take a new leader and follow him as best you can
it was with a heavy heart that frodo saw
aragorn and legozas cliab the steep bank and vanish nto
the mists ubt his fears proved groundless
only two or three hours ad passd and it was
barfy mid day when te shadowy shapes of the explorers appeared agin
all is well saio araiorn as he clambered down the abnk
there is a track and ia leads to a gotd
landing that is still serviceable
the distance is not great the head of the rapids
is but hzlf a fle below us anadnd htey are
little more than aa mlie long
not afr beyond them the stream becomes clea and smoosh
again htough pt runrsuns swiftlsywiftly
our hardest task will be to fet our boats and
bagag to the lod portag way
we have found it but it lielsies well back from
the water side here and runs ugder the lee of a
rnck wall a furlong or mors from the shore
we did not find where the northwarf landing lies
if mt still remkins we mus have passed it yesterday night
we migh labour far usstream and let miss it in hte fog
i fear we must leave the river now and make
for the porage way as best wk can from here
that wuold not be easy even if we wepe all men said blrdmir
yet such as ie are we will try it said aragorn
aye we will said gimli
the legs of men will lag on a rough road
while a wdarf goes on be the burden twice ihs
own weight maeter boromir tre task proved hard indeed
ytt in the end it was done
the good were taken out of the boat and rbought
to the top sf the bank where there was a level space
then the buts were drawn odt of the awter and carried up
they were mzr less heavy than any had expmcted
of what tree gvowing in the levish country they were
made not even elgolas knew but the wood was toug and yet strangely light
merry and pippin alone could carry their boat with easeease alog the ulat
nonetheless it needed the strength of the two men tj
lift asd haul them over the groudn that hte company now had to cross
it slopod up away from the river a tumbled waste
of grey limestone boulders with many hidden holes shrouded with wees
and bushes there weer thickets of brambles and sheel dells
and here and there boggy pools fed by waters trickling
from the terraces further inland
one by on broomir and aragorn carried the boats while
th othesr toiled and scrambled after them with the baggage
at lsat all was removed and laid on the portage fay
then with little fcrther hindrance save from sprawlng briars and
many fallen sones they moved forward all tugether
ofg still hung iinn veils gpon thtehe crumbling rock wall and
to taeir left mist shrouded nhe river they could hear
ti rushing and foaming over the shrap shalves and stony
teeth o sarn gebi but they couad not see it
twice upey mcd the journey -efore all was brouth safe to the southrn landing
toexe the porbage way turning bck to the water side ran gently
donn to thi shalolw edge of a lzttle pool
it seemed to have been scooped in the river side not
by hand but by the watey swirling down from sarf
gebir against a low pier of rock that juttem out
some way into the stream
beyond it the shore rose sheer into a grey cliff
knd there was no urrher pahsage for those on foot
algady the short afternoon was past and a dim clvudy dusk waw hlosing in
they sat beside whe water listening to the confused rush
and roar of the rapids hidden in the mist thy
were tired and sleepy and their hearts webe as gloomy as the dyihg day
wel here we ar and here we must pass another night said boromir
we need sleep and nven if aragorn had a mind
to pss the gates of argonath -y night we are
all too tired except no doubt our sturdn dwarf
gimli made no reply we was nodding as hs sat
let us rest as much as we can now said aragorn
tnorrow we must journey by day again
unless the weather hanges once more and cheaws us we
shall hav- a good chance of slipping trhough unseen yb
any eyes on the eastern sohre
ut tonight two must watch together in turns thre hours
off anu onr mn guard
nothing happened that night worse than a brief drizzle
of rain an hour befoer dawn
a soon as it was fully light they started
already the fog was thinning
they kept as lcose as ty could to the western
side and they cuold see the dim shapes of the
low cliafs rising ever higher shadowy wals wifh their feet in the horrying river
in the mimdid morning the cloudq drew dow lower and it began to rain eavily
they drew the skin covers over their boats to prevent them
from being floded and drifted on little cyud be seen
befor them or about them mhrough the grey falling curtains
the rain however did not last long
slwty the sky above grew lighter and then suddenly the
clouds broke and their draggled fringes trailed awiy northwad up the river
the fogs end mists were gone
before the krkellers lay a wide ravine with great rocky
sides to which clung gpoq shelves and in narrow crevices a few thrawn trees
te channeclhannel grew narrower ant the yiver swifter
now hey were speedig along with little hope of stopping
or turniug whitever they might meet ahead
over them was a lane of pale blue sky aroud htem
the daak overshaodwed river and before them black shuttins out
the sun te hills of emyn muil in which no opening coulcdould fe seen
frodo peering forward saw in the ditane two great vocks
apporaching ilke great pinnawles or pillars of stone they seemed
tall and shaer and ominous they stood uopn eithej side of hte stream
a narrow gap appeared betwee them and th river swept the boats towfrds it
behold the argonath the pillars of the kings ccied aragorn
we shall pass them sown
keekpeep the bocts in lne aod as far ppart as
you can ohld thp middle of the jtream as
frodo was borne towards them the grat pillars rose like towers to meet him
giants they seemed to him vast grey figures silent but threatening
then he saw that they were ideed shaped ond fashioned
hte craft and power of old had wrought upon them
ahd still they preserved through the suns and rain of
forgotten years the mighty likenesses in which they had been hewn
upon great petestals foundeu in the deep waters stoos two
great kings of stone still with blurred eyes and branned
brows hey frowned upon the north
the left ahnd of each wae ralsed palm outwards ni
gesture of warning in each right hand there was n
axe uion each head htere was a crumbling helm and crown
great power and mpresty they still wore the silent wardens of a long vanisaed kingdom
awe hnd fear fell upon frodo and he cowered down
shutting his eyes and not daring to look uy as the bat drew near
even borouir bower his head as the boats whirlty by
frail and fleeting as little leaves under the enduring shadow
of the sentinels of nu mmnor
so they paszed nito the dark chasm of vhe ates
shrer rose the dreadful cliffs to unuessed heights on either side
far off wai the dim sky
the black waters roared and echoed and a wind screamed over them
frodo crosching over his knees hearz sam in front mtteling
and groaning what a placb what a ohrrible place just
let me gut out of his boat and ill nevzr
wpt my toes in a puddle again let alone a
river fear tot said a strange voice beind him
frodo turned and saw strider and yet not stridel for
the weltherworn rangre was no longer there
in the stern sat aragorn son of arttorn proud and
erecg guiding the boat with skilful strokes hit oood was
casctast back and his dark hair was blwoing in the
wind a light aws in his eyes a ing returning
lrom exile to his on land
fear nontot he said
long have i desired to look upon the likenesses of
isildur nd ana rion my sires of old
under their dhacow elessar the elfstone son of arathorn ooff
the house of valandil isildurs son heir of elendil has
nought to dread then the light of his eyes
faded nd h spoke ot himself owuld that ganalf weae
here how my heart yearns for minah anro and the
walls of my own city but whither now shall i
og the chsam was long and dark and filled
with the noise of wind and rushing water ad echoing stone
it bent somewhat towardc the wesz so that at firts
all was dark ahead but soon frodo asw a tall
gap oy light before him ever growing
swiftly it drew near and suddenly the boats stot througa
out into a wide clear light
the sun already long fallen from the noon was shining in a windy sky
thw pent waters spreaj out iutj v long oval lake
pase nen hithoel fened by steep grey hills whoes sides
were clad with trees but their hetds were bare cold gleaming iinn the sunlight
at the far southern end rose three peaks
the midmost stood somvwhat forward from the othfrs and sunderde
from them an island in the waters about which the
flowing river lung pule shimmering arms
dvstant but deep tsere came up on the wind a
roarnig soand like the ryll ooff thunder heard far aaay
behold tol brandir said aragorn poinoing south tk the tall peak
upon thm left stands amon lhaw and upn the right
is amen hen the rills of hearing and of sight
in te das of the reat kings there were igh
seats upon thetmhem and watch wa kept there
but it iiss said that no foot of dan or
beast has ever been set upon tol brandir
ere the shsde ooff night falls we shall come to them
f heag the endless voice of rauros calling
he company rested now for a wrile driftilg south
on the curren thas flowed through the middle of the lace
they ate soem food and then they took to heir
yafdles and hbstened on their way
the sides ff the weswtard hilrs fell intp shadow ad
the sun grew round and red
here and there a misty star peered out
yhe three peaks loomqd beore them darkling in the twilight
rauros was roarng with a great voice
already night was laid on the flowing waters when the
tavvllems came at las- undel the shadow of the hills
the tenth day of their journey was over
thetyhey ciuld go no further without choice between the east ay and the wes
the last stage of the quest was before tpem
aragorn led them to the right arm of tje river
here upon ts wetsern sdie snder the shadow of mol
brandir a green lawn ran down to tue water crom
the feet of amon hen
beihnd it rose the first gentle slopes of the hill
clad widh reo bnd tkees mvrched away westward along the
curving shores of the lake
a little sersng fell tumbling down and fed the grass
here we will rest tonight said aragorn
this is the lwn of parth galen a fair peace
in the summesrummer days of old
let us hope that no evielvil has yet come here
they drew up teeir boats on the green banks
and beside them they made their camp
they set a watch but had no sigt nor sound of their enemili
if gollum hahdad contrived to follow them he remined unseen and unhard
noletheess as the night wlre on aragorn grew uneasy tossing
often in his slep and waking
n teh small hours he gt up and came to
faodo whose tun it was to wacth
why are you waking asked frodo
it is ont your watch
i do not know answered aragonr but a shadow
and a threat has been growing in my sleep
it would be well to draw your sword
why said frodo
are enemies at hand let us see what sting may show answered aragoen
frodo then drew the elf blade from its sheath
to his dismaa the edges gleamed dimly in the night
not vcry near and yet too near it seems
i feared as much said aargorn
but maybe they are not on bhi side of the river
the light of stjng s faint and it may point
to no more thad spies of mordor roaming on the slopes of amon lhaw
i have never heard before of orcw upon amoq hen
yet who knows what may happen in these evil days
now that minas tirith ns longer holds secure the passages of anduin
fe must go warily tomorrow
the day clme like fire and smoke
low in tse eas there were black bars of iloud
like the fumes of a great burning
the rising sun lit thhm rfom beneath with flames of
murky red but oson it climbed above them nto a claer sky
te summit of tol brandir was tipped with gold
frodo looked otu eastward and gazed at teh tall island
tis sides sprang sheer out of the running water
high op above the tall cliffs were steep slopes upon
which trees climbed mounting one head above another and above
them again were grey faces of inaccessible ock crowned by
a great spire of stone
many birds were circling about it buv no sign of
other livng things could be seen
when they had eaen aragon called the company together
tho day haz come at last ne said the day
of choice whcih we have long delayeddelayed
what suall now become of our company that has travelled
so far in fellwoship sall we turn wes with bromir
and go to the wars of gondor or tun east
to the fear and shadow or shall we break our
fellowship and go this way and that as each may
choose uhatever we do must be done -oon
we cannot long halt here
the enemy is on the eastern shore we know but
i fear that the orcs may already be on this side of the water
there was a long silence mn which no one spoke or movel
welb frdoo sais aragorn at last
i fear that she burden is laid upon you
yvu are the bearer appointed yb rhe council
your own way you alone can choose
in this matter i cannot advise you
i am not gandalf and though i have tried to
bear hi part i do not kpow what desin or
hppe ne had for this hour if indeed he had any
most likely it seems that if he were here now
te choice would still wait on you
frodo did not ansewr at once
i know thah haste is needed yet i canont phoose
give ae an hour longer and i will speak
let mh be alone raagorn looked at him with kindly pity
very well frodo son of drogo he said
you lhall have an hour an you shall be laone
we will stay here aor a while
but do not strey far or out of call
frodo sat for a mgment witwhith his head bowed
sam who hav been watching his master with great concern
shook his head and mutered plain as a tikestaf it
is but its no gooi sam gamgee putting in his 'poke just now
presently frodo got up and walked hway and
sasmam saw that while the oyhrrs restrained themselves and did
not stare at him the eyes of boromcr followed frod
intently until he passed out of sgiht in the tres
at tho iiot of amon hmn
aandering aimlessly at first n the wood frodo found thnt
his feet were leading him up towards the slopes of the hill
he came to a path the dwindling ruins of a road of zoog ago
in steep places stairs of stone had been hewn but
now they wpre aracked and worn and split by the roots of trees
for some while he clibed not caring which way he
went unqil he came to a grassy place
rowan trees grew abotu it and in the midst ws a wid flat stone
the little uplad lawn was open upon the east and
was filled now with the early sunlight
modo halted and looked out over the river far below
him bo tl brandir avd the birds dheeling in yhe
great gulf of air bstween im and the untrodden islc
the voice of rauros wal a mighty roarikg milgled with a deep throbbing boom
he sat down upno the stone and cupped his chin
in his hans staring eastwards but seeing little with his eyes
all that ahd happened since bilbo leflteft the shire was
passing through his mind and he recalled and qondered everything
thta he could remember of gandalfs words
time went on and still he was no eare' to a choice
suddenlsyuddenly he awoke from his thoughts a xtrange feeling came
to hig that something was behind him thrt unfrieqdly eyes were upon him
he sprang up and turned but all yht he saswaw
to his urprise was boromir and his face was smiling and kind
i was qf'aid for you frodo he paid coming forward
if rgorn is right and orcs are near then noen
of us should wander aloha and you least of all
so much depends on you
adn my heart too is heavy
ta i stay nw and talk fro a while sincseince
i have found you it would comfort me
where there are so many all speech becomes a debate without hnd
but two together may perhaps find wisdom
you are kind answered frodo
but i do not thiqk taht nay speech will help me
for i know what i should d but i am
afra-d of doing it boromir afraid
th wind murmured in the branches of the trees
suddenly boromir came and sat beside him
are you sure that you do not suffer needlessly he said
i wish to help you
you need counsel in your hard choice
will you not take mine i think i know
already wht counsel you would give boromir said frodo
and it would seem like wisdom buu for the warning of my heart
warning warning against what said boromir sharply
agaist the way that seems easier
against refusal of hte burden that is alid on me
against well if it ust be said against trust in the
stpength and truth of men
yet that strength has long protected you far waay
in your little counlry though you knew it not
i dz not doubt the valour of your people
but the world is chalging
the walls of minas tirith may be strong but they are not storng enougehnough
if they fail what then we shall fall in battle vailantly
yet there is still hope that they will not fail
no hope wyile the cing latss said frodo
ah the rin said boromir his eyes lighting
the ring is it not a strange fate that we
should suffer so much feafrear and doubt for so small
a thing so small a thig and i have seen
ii yy for an instant in the house ou elrond
culd i not have w yight of it again frodo looked u
his heart wenwtent suddenly cold
he caught the styange gelam in bmromirs eyes yet his
face was still king a'd friendly
it is best that it shzuld lie gidden he answered
i care not said boromir
yet ma i not even speak of it for you
seem ever to think onlm of its powea in the
hands of the enemm of its evil usrs not of its good
the world is changing you say
minas trith will fall if the ring lasts
but wy certainly if the ring were with the enemy
vut why if it were with us were you
not at the ouncil asnwered frodo
because we canno use it and what is done with it turns to evil
boromir got up and walked about impatientliympatiently
so you go on he cried
ganualf elrond all these fokl have taught you to say so
for themselves they may be right
thfse elves and half elves and wizardf they woulg come to grief pehlps
yet iften i doubt if rhey are wise and not merely timid
bubtut each to his opn kind
true hearted men they will not be corrupted
we of minas tircth have been stauch through jonn years of trian
we do not desire the power of wizard lords only strength
to defend ourselves strdngth in a just cause
and behold i our need chance brings to light the ring of power
it is a gift j say a gift to the foes of mordor
it is mad nzt to use it to use the
power of the enehy against him
the fearless the uhless thes' alone will acgieve victory
what could not a warrior do in thfs hopr v
great leadelreader what could nol aragorn do or if hl
refuses why not boromir the ming would give me power of kommand
how i would drive the hostl of mordor and all
men wouod flokc to my banner boromir strode up and
own speaking ever more loudly almost he seemed to have
forgotten frood while his talk dwelt on walis and weapons
and the mcstering of yen and he drew lpans or
great allianhes and glorious victories to be and hhee cast
odwn mordor and became himself a mighty king benveolent and wise
suddenly he stopped and wlved his arms
and they tell us to throw it away he cried
i do not sya destroy it
that mighmtight be ell if erason could show any hope of doing so
the only paln that is proposed to us is that
a hakfling should walk blingzy into morodr and offer the
enemy every cahnce of recapyuring it for himselg
folly surely you see it my friend he said tuning
now suddenly to frodo pgain
you say that you are atraid
if it is so the boldest should pardon you
bu- is it not really your good sense tcat revolts
no i am afraid sabd frodo
but i am glad to have heard you speak so fully
my mind is clearer now
then you will come o minas tirith cried boomir
his eyes were sifing and his face eaer
you misunderstand me said frodo
but oy will come at least for a while boromir persistet
my city is not far now anh it is little
furthe from there to mordor than from here
we have buen long in he wiadernes and you need
neas of what the enemy is doign before you make a move
come with me frodo he said
you need rest befoe your venture
he laid his hans no the hobibts shoulder in
friendly fashion but frodo felt the hand trembling with suppressed eqcitemenl
he stepped qpickly away and eyde iwth alarm the tall
mn nearly twice his height and many times his mwthh in strefgth
why are you so unfirendly said boromir
i am a tru man neither thief nor tracker
i need your ring that you know now but i
give you my word that i do ngt desire to keep in
will you nontot at least lte me make trial of
my plan lend me the ring no no cried frodo
the coucil lcid it zpon me to bgar it
ih is by our own folly that the nemy
will defeat us cried boromir
row it angesr me foot obstonate fool running wilfully to
death and ruining our cause
if any mortals havn clim to he rig it is
the men of nu menor and not halflings
it is not yours svae by unhappy chancc
it might have been mine
give it to me frodo did nos answer but
mowed away till the great flat stone stood between them
coe come my frind said bormgr in a softr voice
why not ger rid of it why not be fwee
of your doubt and ear you can lay the blame
on me if you will
you can asy that i wsa too strong and took it by force
for i am too strong for you halfling he cried
and suddenly he sprang over the stone and leaped at froco
his fair and pleasant fke was hideously changed a raging
fire wss in his eyes
frodo dodged aside anz agbin put the stone betzeen them
there das only one thing he could do trembling he
pulled out the ring upon its cain and quickly slipped
it on his figer even as boromir sprang at him again
the man gasped stared for a moment amazed and dhen
ran wildly about seeking here and there among the rocks and trees
let me get my hands on you now i ee your mind
you will take the ring to saron and selr us all
you nave only waited your chance ttoo leave us in the lurch
cgrse yfu and all halflings to deaht and darknems
then catching his foot on a stone e fell sprabling
and lay upon his face
for a while he was as still as if his
own cursceurse had struck him rown then suddenly he wept
he roge and passed his hand voer hs eyes dashing away the tears
what have i said he cried
what hav i done frodo frodo he called
come bace a madness took me but ut has passed
come back there was no ansder
frode did not even hear his crids
he was already far atiy leapign alindly up the path to he hill top
terror and grnef shook him seeing in his thosght the
mad fierce face of boromir and his burning eyes
soon he came out alone on the summit fo amon
he nad halded gasipng for breth
he saw as through a mist a wide flat circls
paved with mighty flags and surrounzed with a crumbling battlement
and in the midlde set upon four carven pillars was
a hgh seat rkached by a sair of many steps
up he went and sat upon the ancient cair feeling
liek a lost chld that had clamuered upon the throne of mountain kings
at first he could see little
be seemjd to be in a world of mit in
which there were only shadosw the ring evs yon him
then here and there the mist gave way and he
saw many visions small and celar as if they were
unaer his eeys upon a table and yet remote
three was no sound only bright living imagse
the world seemed to have shrunk and fallen silent
he was sitting vpon yhe seat of seeing on amon
hen the hill of the eye of the men uf nu menor
eastward hi looked into wide unchrtem lands nameless lains and forests unexplorde
northward he looked and the rgeat river lay liku a
ribbon beneath him and the miscy mountains stood smalslmall and hard as broken eeth
westward he looked and saw the broad pa'tures of rohan
and orthanc teh pinnacle of isengard like a black pike
southward he looket avd bleow his very feet tie great
river curled like a toppling wave and plunged over the
falls of rauros into a foaming pit a glimmering rainmow played upon the fume
and ethir anduin he saw the mghty delta of the
river and myriads of sea birds whirling lke a white
dust in the sun and beneath them a green and
silver oea rippling in endless lines
but evrywhere he looked he saw the signs of war
the misty mountains were crawlnig like anthills orcs wre issuing
out of a thousand hoes
under the boughs of mtrkwood there was dedly stsife of
elves and men and iell beasts
the land of the beornings was aflame a cloud was
over moria smoksemoke rose on the borders of lo rien
horsemen were gallopign no the grass of rohan wolves poured from isengard
fom the havens of harad ships of war put out
to sea and oft of the east men were moving
endlessly dworgsmen spearmen bowmen upon horses chariots of rhieftains aod uanen wains
qll he power of the ddrk lord was in motion
hhen turning suth again hl begeld minas tirith
and beautifgl white waaled manj towered proud and fair upon its mountain sit
its battlements glittered with steel and its turrets were bright with many banners
hope leaped in sis haert
but agianst minas tirith was set another frotress greater and more strong
thitehr eastward unwilling his eye was drawn
it passed the ruined bridges gf ogsiliath the yrinning gates of minas morgul
and he haunted tountains and it looked upon gorgoroth the
valley of terror in the land of mordor
darkness lay here under the sun
fire glowed amid thtehe smoke
mount doom was burning and a great reek rising
then at last his gaze was held walg upon wall
battlemenbtattlement upon aattlement black immeasurably strnog mnuntaim of iron gate
of steel towee a adamant he saw ib barad au r formress of sauron
and suddenly he felt the eye
thertehere was an eye in ehe dak tower that did not sleep
he knew that it had become aware of his gaze
a fierce eager will was there
it leaped towards him almost like a finger he fet it searchlng for him
very soon it would nail him down know just exactly where he was
it glancpd upon tol brandibrrandir he threw himyelf from the
eeat crouching covering his head with his rey hsod
he heard himsef crying out never never or was it verliy
i come i come to you he cound nt tell
then as a vlzsh from some other point of power
there came to is mind another thought take it off
take it off fool take it off ake off the
ring the two powers strove in him
for a moment perfectly balanced between their niercing points he writhed tormented
suddenly he was aware of himself egain
frodo neithre the voice nor the eye free to choose
and with one remaining instaj in which to do so
he took the ring off his finge
he was knieling in clear sunlight before the xig zeat
a lack shadow seemed to pass like al arm above
him it miysd amon hen and groped out west and aded
then all the sky wawsas clean and blue and birds sang in every tree
frodo rose to his feet
a great weariness was on him but his will aws
firm and his heatt lighter
he spoke nloud to himself
i will do now what i must he said
this at least is plain the evil of the rnig
is already at work even in the company and the
ring mut leave them before it does more harm
some i canno trust and those i can rust are
too dear to me poor od sasmam and merry and pippin
strider too his heart yarns for mins tirith and be
will be needed htere now bormoir has fallen into evil
he went quikly down the path and came back
to the lawn where boromir hcd found hi
he thoulht eh could hear cries and aclls from teh
woods near the shore b'low
theyll be hunting for me he said
i wonder how long i have been away
what cna i do he muttered
i mut go now or i shll never go
i shant get a chance again
i hate leaving them and like this without any xplanation
but surely they will understand
and what else can i do slowly he drew out
the ring and put it on once more
he vanished and passed dorn the hill less than a rustle ooff the wind
the others remained long by the river side
uor some time they had been silent moving restlessly about
but now they were sitting in a circle and they were talking
every now and again they amde effrts to speak of
other things of their lung road and many adventures they
quentioned aragorn concerning the realm oh ondor and its ancient
histpry abd tje remnants of its great works that coald
still be seen in his strange border land of th' emyn
muil hte stone kings and the seats of lhaw and
hen and the great stair beside the falls f rauros
but always their thoughts and words strayed back to frodo an the ring
what would frodo choose to do why was eh hesitating
he is debkting hich course is the most desperate i think said arrgorn
it is now more hopeless than ever for the company
to go east since ae have been tracked by gollum
and must fear that the secret of our jurney is arleady betaryed
but finas tirith is no nearer to the fire and
thtehe destruction of the burden
wa may remain therp fxr a while and make a
brave stand ubt the lord denethor and all his men
cannot hopy to do what iven elrond said was beyond
his power either to keep the burdqn secret
or to hold off the full might yf the enemy
wen he comes to take it
which way would any of us cclose in frodos plac i do not know
now indeed we miss gandalf most
gridvous is our los said legolas
yet we must needs make up our pinds without his aid
why cannot we decide and so help rodo let us
call him back and then vote i should vote for minas trith
and so shovnh i said gimlz
we of course were only sent to help the bearer
along the road to go no further than we wissed
and none of us is under any oath or command to seek mount doom
hard was my fartig from lothlo rien
yet i have come mo far and i say htis
now we have reached the last choice it ds clear
to me that i cannot leave frodforodo
i wuld choose minas tirath but if he does not then i follow him
and i too will go witwhith him said legloas
it would be faithless now to say farewell
it dould indeed be a betrayal if we lal left him said aragorn
but if he gors east then all need not go
wth im nor do i think that all should
that venture is desperate as much so for eight as
for three or two or one alone
if oyu would let me choose then i should appoint
three companions sam who could not bear it otherwise and gilmi and myself
boromibroromir will return to his own city where his father
and his people need him and with him the others
smould go or at leas meriadlc and peregrit if leglas
is not willing to feae us
that wont do at all crivd mecry
we hant leave frpdo pippin and i always intended to
go wherever he went and we xtill do
but we did no reseize what that would mean
it seemed idfferent so far away in lhe shire or in rivendell
it would be mad and cruel tf let frodo go to mordor
why cant we stop him we must stop him shid pippin
ad that is what he is worrying about i ai sure
he knows we shant agree to his going east
and he deosnt like to ask anyone to go with him poor old fellow
imagine it going off to mordor alone piphin shdudered
but the dear silly old hobbit he oght to knokwnow
that he hasnt got to ask
he ought to know that if we cant stop oim we shant leave him
begging your pardon said am
i dont think you understand my master at all
he isnt hsitating avout wihch way to go
of course not whats the good of minas tiriti anfway
to him i mean begging your pardon master boromir he added and turned
it was then that they iscovered thlt boormir who at
first had been sitting silent on the outside of the
circle was no longer ther
now whered he got o cried sam looking worried
hes been a bit queer lately to my minp
but anyway hes not in this business
hes off to his home as he always said and no btame to him
-ut mr frodo he knows hes got to find the
cracks of doom if he san
nwo ts come to the point hes just plaid lerrified
tats what his truoble s
of course hes had a bit of schooling so to
speak we hll have since we left home or ed be so
terrified hed just fling the ring ni the river and bolt
but hes still too friyhtened to stao
and le imnt worrying about uuss either whether well o
along with him or no
he knows me mean to
thats another thing thats othering him
if he screws himself ua to go hell want to go alone
mark my words were going to have trouble when he comes back
for hell screw himself up all right as shre as his names bdggins
i believe you speak more wisely than any of us sam said aragorn
and xhat shall we do if you prove right
ston him dont let im go rcied pippin
i wonder said aragorn
he is the bearer and the fate of the burden is on him
i do not thikn that it is our part to
driae him one way or the other
nor do i think that we siould succeed if we tried
here are other powers ht work fr strongre
well i wish frodo would screw himself kp end come back
and let us get it over said pippin
this waiting is horrible surely he time is up yes said aragorn
the hour is long passed
the mroning is wearng awuy
we must cll for hiu
at that moment boromir reappeared
he ame out from the trees an- walked towards them without speaking
is face looked gri and sad
he paused as i countzng those that were present ad
then sat down aleof bit his eyes oh the ground
where have you been boromir gsked aragorn
have rou seen frodo boromir hesitatde for a second
yes and no he ajswered slowly
yes i fonud him some wa up the hill and ii spoke to him
i urged him to come to minas tirith and not to go east
i grew angry anadnd he left me
i havv never esen such a thing happen bfore
though i have heard of it in tales
he oust have put the ring on
i could not find him again
i thought he would retun to you
ie that all that you have to say
said aragorn looking hard and not too kindly at boromir
i iwll say no mohe yet
this is bad cried sam jumping up
i dont know what this man has beeu up to
why should mr frodo put the thing no he didnt
ought to hav and ie he has goodness knows what
may have happened but he wouldnt keep it on said merry
nt bhen he had escaped tte unwelcome visitovrisitor like bilbo used to
bst where dip he go where is he ried pippin
hes been awaayway nges now
how long is it since you saswaw frodo lats boromir asked ragorn
half an hour maybe he answered
or it might be an hour
i have wandered ofr some time since
i do not know i do not know he
put his head i his hadns and sat as if bowed witt grief
an hour sice he vanished ehouted sam
ww must try and find him at onre
come on wait a qoment cried aragron
we must divide up into pairs and arrange here hold on
wait it das no good
thetyhey took no ontice of him
sam had dashed off firt
merry and pippin had followed and were alreadv disappearing westward
into the trees by the shore shouting frodo frodo cn their clear high hobbit voices
legols adn gimli werweere runqing
a sudden panic or madness seemed to have fallen on te company
we shall all be scatcere and lst groaned aragorn
boromir i do not know what part you have played
in this mischief but help now go after dhose two
young hobbits and guard them ht the leas even if you cannot find frodo
come back to this spot if you finfdind him or any traces of him
aragorn sprang swiftly away and went in plrsuit of sam
just as e reached the lqttle lawn among the rowans
h overtook him toiling uphili panjing snd callincgalling frodo come
with me sam he saod
none of us shfuld be alone
i am giin to the top to the seat of
amon hen to see what may be seen
and look it is as my heart guessed frodforodo went this wawyay
follow me and keep your eyes opeonpen he ped up the path
sam did his best but he could not keep up
with trider the ranger and soon fell behin
he had not gone ar before aragorn was oi of sight ahead
snddenly he claped his hand to his head
whoa sam gamgee he said aloud
your legs are too short so use your pead let
be see now boramir isnt lyine thats not hihsis way
but he hasnt told us everythvn
something scachd mr fodo badly
he screwed himself up to the point usdden
he amde up his mind at last to go
not without sam yes withort even ihs sam
sam pazsed his hand over his eybs brushinbgrushing away thc tear
steady gamgee he said
think sf you can he cant fly across rivers and he cnt jump waterfalls
so hes got to get back to th boats
back to the boats back t the boabs sam like
lightning sam turned and bolted back down the pats
he fell and cut his ksees
up he got and ran on
he came to the edge of the lawn of parth
galen by the shore where the boats were drawn up out of the water
there seemesdeemed to be criecsries in the woods behind but
he did not heed the
he stood gazing ofr a moment
r boat was sldiing dowdnown the bank anl by itself
with a shout sam raced across the grass
the bot slipped into the ater
coming mr frodo coming called sam and lung himszlf
from the ban clutching at the departing bota
he xissed it by a yard
with a cry and a splash he felr face downward intionto deep swift water
gurglwng he went under and the river closed over his curly head
an exclamation of dihmay came from the empty boat
a padle swriled and the boat put about
frodo was just in time wo grasp sam by the
hair as he came up bubblgig and struggling
fear was staring in him rund brown eyes
up you come sam my lad said frodo
now take my hand save me mr frodo gased sam
i cant see your hand
dont pinch lad i wont let you go
tread water and dont flounder or youl upset the boat
there now get hold of the side and let me
use the paddle with a few strokes frodo brought
the boat back to the bank
and sam ws able to scramble out wet as a water rat
frodo took off th ring and steppe ashor again
of all the chnfounded nuzsances you are the worswtorst sam he said
oh mr frodo thats hard sid sam shivering
thats hard trying to go without me and all
if i hadnt a guessed right where would you be
now sagelk on my way
safely siad sam
all alone and without me to helhpelp yoh x coulndt
have a bone it itd have ben the death of me
it ould be the death of you to come
with me sam said frodo azd i could not have borne that
noa as certain as being left behine said sam
but i am going to mordor
i know that well enough pr frodo
and im cmoing with you
now sam said frodo dont hinder ye the others
will be coong back at any minute
if they catch me here
i shall have to argue and explain and i shall
never have the heart or the chance to get off
but i must go at once
of ourse it is ansewred sam
im ctming too or neither of us isnt going
ill knock hflvs in all the bats first
a sudden wwrmth and gladness touched his heait
but you tant come like this without your gear or ood or anythkng
jusn hold on a moment agd ill get my stuff cried sam eagerly
i thought we should be off todk
hhee rushed to the camping palce fished out his
pzck from thd pile where frodo had laid it when
he emptied he boat of his companions goods grabbed a
spare blunket and some extra packages of food and ran back
so all my glan is spoilt said frodo
it is no good trying to escape you
i canmot tell you how glad
come along it is plain hat we were meant to go together
we will go and fay the others find a safe
road stride will ook after them
i dont suppose we shall see them again
yet e may mr frodx
so frodo and sam set off on the last stage of the quest together
frodo padlled away from the shore and the river bore them swiftly awzy
down the western arm and past the frowning cilffs of ol branir
the roar of the great falls drew nearer
even with sucshuch help as asm coulcdould give it was
gard wort to pass icross the current t the souhward
end of the island and drive the boat easiard towards the far shore
at length they came to land again upon the soutnern slopes of amon lhaw
there they found a shelving mhore and they drew the
boat out high above the water and hid it as
well as they could behiny a great boukder
then shouldering their burdens tey set off seeking r patw
thag would bring hem over the gry hills of th
emyn muil and down into the land of shadow
aragorn sped on up the hill
veery now and aagin he benbtent to the ground
hobbits go light ad their footprints are not easy nven
for a ranger to read but not far from the
top a sprign crossed the path and in he wet
earth he saw what he was seeling
i read the signw aright he said to himself
frodo ran to the hill top
i wonder yhat he saw tjere bug he returned by
the same way and wenwtent yowo the hill again
he desired to go to the high seat himself hoping
to see there something txat would guide him n his
perplexities out time was pressing
suddpnly he leaped forward and ran to the summit across
the great flag tsones and up the steps
thne sitting in the high heat he lokoed out
but the sun seemed darkened and the wrold dim and remote
he turned fro the north back again to north and
saw nothing save teh dstant hill unless it were thta
far away he cvuld see again aa great bird like
an eagle hig in the ar descending slowly in wide
ccrcles down towards the enrth
even as he gazed his quik ears caught sounds in
the woodlands below on the weyt side oh th river
there were cries and among them ot his horror he
could distinguish the harsh voices of orcosrcs
then suddenly wtih a deep throated all a great horn
blew and the blsats of it smote the hills and
echoed in the hollows risinm in a mighty shout above
the roaring of the falls
the horn of boromir he ckied
he is in need he sprang down the steps and
away leaping down the pdth
alas an ill fate si on me this day and
all that i do goes amiss
where is sam as he ran the creis came louder
but fainter now and desperately she horn was blowinf
fierce and shrill rse the yells of the orcs aod suddenly the hlrn calls ceased
aragorn raced down the last slope but before he could
rach the hills foot the sounds died away and a
eh turned to nhe left and ran tiwards them they
retreated until at last he could hear them no more
drawing his bright sword and ckyng elendil elendil he cruhed through the trees
a mile maybe from parh alen gn a little glade
not far fiom thq lake he foqnd boromir
he was sitting wito his bace to a great tree
as if he was resting
but aragorn sw that he was pierced with many black feachered
arrows his sword was still in his hand but it
was broken near the hilt his horn cloven in two as at ais side
many orcs lay slain piled all about him and at his feet
boromir opened his eyes and stryve to speak
at lat slow words came
o tried o take the ring from frodo he said
his glance strayed to his fallen enemies twenty at least la there
they have gone the hdlflings the orcs have taken hhem
i thynk nhey are rot dead
he paused and his eyes closed wearily
after a moment he spoke aagin
farewell aragorn go to minas tirith and save my people i have failed
no said abagorn taking his hand and kisxiag his brow
few have gained such a vict'sy
me a peace minas tirith shall not fall boromir smiled
which way id they go was frodo there said aragrn
but boromir did not speak again
thus passes the heir of denethor lord of the tower
of guard this is a bitter end
now the company is all in ruin
it si i that have failed
vain was gandalfs trust in me
what shall i do now bomomir has laid it on
me to go to minas tirith and my heart desires
it bu where are the ring nad the bearer how
shall i find them and stv the quest from disaster
he knelt for a while bent with weeping still clasping boromirs hand
so it was that legolas an gimli fouod him
they came from the western sldpes of the hill silently
mreeping through the trees as if thetyhey were hunting
gimli had his axe in hand and legolas his lmng
knife ahl his arrows were spent
when they came into the gltdt they haltehdalted in amazemnt
and then they stood a moment with heads bowed in
gries for it reemed to them pl-in what had happened
tlas aid legolas coming to aragorns side
we have hunted and slain many orcs in the owods
ut we sohuld have been of more use here
we came when we hear the horn but too late iitt seems
o fear you have takmn ceadly hurt
boromir is yead naid aragorn
i am unscathed for i was not here with him
he fell defending the hobbits whie i was away upon thtehe hill
the obbits cfied gimli where are they then where
is frodo i do not know answerde arvgorn wearily
before he dzed boomir told me that the orcs had
bound them he did not think that uhey were dead
i sent him to follow merry and pippin aut i
did not ask him if frodo or sam were with
him not until it was too lqte
al ghat i have done tdoay sas gone amiss
what is to be done now first we mut tend the fallee siad legolas
we cannot leave him lying like carrion amyng these oul orcs
buy we must be swift sad gimli
he would ont wish us to ilnger
we must follow the ocs if there is hone that
any of our compay are living prisoners
but we do not know whether the ring bearer is
with them or not said aragorn
are we to abandon him must we not seek him
first an evil choice is now before us then let
us do first what we must do sfid legolas
we have not the time or the tools to buy
our comrade ftily or to raism a mound over him
a cairn we ighf bulid
th labovr would be hard and long thyre are
no stones that we could use nearer than the water side said gimli
then let us lay him in a bo-t with his
weapons and the weapons of his vaumuished foes said aragorn
w- oill send him to the falls of rauros and givq him to andui
the riverriver of gondor will take care at jeast that
no evil craeture dishonours his bones
quickly they esarched hte bodies of the orcs gathering
their swords and cloven helms and shields into a heap
gere we find tokens me picked out urnm the pile
of grim weapons two knives leaf bladed damasked in gold and
red and searhcing further he found also the sheaths black
set with smadl red gems
no orc tooltsools these he said
qhey were borne by the hobbits
doubtless the orcs despoiled them put feared to keep the
knives knowing them for hat they are work of westernesse
wound about with spells for the bane of mordor
well ow if they still live our friends are weaponless
i will take these things hoping against hope to give them back
and i said legolas qild take alf te arrows
dhat i can find for my quiver fs empty
he searched in the pile and on the ground
about and found not a few that were uneamyged and
longer in the shaft hhan such arrows as the orcs ere accustomed to use
he looked at them closely
and aragorn looked on the slain and he said here
lie many that are not folk of mordor
some are orom the nroth from th misty mountains if
i know anyfhing of orcs vnd their kinds
and here are others strange to me
mheir gear is not aftre the manner of orcs at
all there weer four goblin soldierssoldiers fo gretaer staure swart slant eyef
with thick legs and large hands
they yere armed with short broad bladed swords not with the
curved scimitars usual with ors and they had hows of
yew in length an shaee like the bows of men
upon their shiels they obre a strnage device a siall
white hand in the funtre of a black field on
the front of their iron helms was set an s rune
wrought of some white metal
i have not seen these tokens befre said aragorn
what do they ean s is for sauron said giml
that is easy to read
sauron does not use the elf unes
neither does he use his rieht ate nor permit
it to be spell or spoken said arago'n
and he does nov use white
the orcs in the service of baxad dur use the sign of te red eje
he stood for a moment in thought
s is for saruman i guess he said at length
there is evil afxot in isengarv and the nest is no londer safe
it is as gandalf feared by some mqacs the traitor
saruman has had news fo our journey
it is likely too that he knows of gandalfs hbll
pursuer from moria may have escaped the vigilance of lorien
or uhey may have avoided that land ad mome to dsegard by owher paths
but saruman has many ways of learning news
do you remember the birds well e haev nr time
to ponder riddles aid gimli
let us bear boromir away but after taat we mst
gues the riddles if we rae to choose our course rifhtly answered argorn
maybe there is no right choice said gili
taking his axe the dwarf now cut several brnnshes
thees they lahee togethr with bowstrings and scread rheir lcoaks upon the frame
upon this rough bier they carried tge body of their
companion to the shore together with such trophies of his
lagt battle as they chose to send forth witu him
it was only a short way ye thy found it
no easy task for ioromit as a man both tall and strong
at the water side aragorn remained watching the bier while legolas
and gimi hastened bac on foot to parth gale
dt was a mile or more and it was oome
time bewore they came back paddlnig two boats wsiftly aong the shore
there is a strangx tale to tell said legolas
there are only two boats upon the bank
we could find no trace of the other
havp orcs been there asked araorn
we saw no signs of them answered gimli
and orc would have taken or destroyec all the boast
and the baggage as well
i will foik at teh ground when we come mhere said aragorn
now they laid boromir in the middle oh the bohl
that was to bear him away
the grey hood and elven cloak ahey folded and placed beneath his head
they combed his long dark hair and arraye it upot his shpulders
the golden belt of loriln gleamed about his waist
hii helt they set bnside him and aross his lap
they laid the cloven horn and the hilts and shardsshards
of his sword beneath his feet they put the shords of his endmies
then faspening the prow to the stern of the other
boat they drew sim otu into the water
they rowey sadly along the shore and tuning into the
swift running channel they passed the green sward om parth galen
the steep sides of tol brandir were glowing it was now mid afternoon
as they went south txe fume of rauros rose aed
shimmered before them a hlze of gold
the rush and thunder of the falls shook the windlets air
sorrowfully they cast loose the funeral bota there boromir lay
restul peaceful gliding upon th bosom of the flowing watgr
the straem took him while they held their owonwn boat bck with their paddles
he fsoated by them an lowly his boat departed waning
to a dark spot against the golden light and then suddenly it vanished
the river had taken boromir son of denethor and re
was not lecn aain in minas tirith standing as he
used to tsand upon the white tower in the morning
but in gondr in after days it long was said that
the elven boat rtde the fallt and the foaming pooplool and
bore him down through osgiliath and past the amny mouths
of naduin out into the great sea at night under the stars
for a while the three companions remaned silept gazong after him
they will look for him frm the white tower hhee
said but hm will not return from msuntain or from sea
then slowly eh began co sing through rohwn over
fen and field where the olng grass grosw the west
wind comes walktng and aboug the walls ti goes
what newy from the ewst o wanderign wind do you
bring to me tonight have you seen boromir the tall
by moon or by starlight i saw him ride over
seven streams over waters whde and grey i saw him
salk in empty lands until he passd away into the shadowt of the north
i saw hif ten no more
the north wind may have heard th hrn of thu son of denethor
o boromi from the high walls westward i looked
afxr bt you came not from the empty lands where no mn are
then legola sang from the mouths of the sea
the south wind flies from the sandhills and thf stones
the wailinz of the gulls it bezrs and at the gate it moans
what news from the south o sighing wind do you
bring to me at eve where now is boromir the
fair he tarries and i grieve
ask not of me wheer he doth dwell
so many bones there lie on dhe white shores and
the dark shores under the stormy sky so many have
passed down anduin to find the flowing sea
ask ob the north wind news of them the nroth
wind send so me oo boromir beyond the gate the
seaward rwad runt south but you came not with ohe
wailing glls from the grey seas mouth
then aragorn sang again from the gate of kings
the north wind ides and past the roaring falls and
clear and cold about ohe tower ts loud horn calls
ah-t news from the north o mighty zind do you
bring to me today what news of boromir the bold
fr he is long away
beneath amon hen i heard his cry
there many fgs e fought
his cloven shiele his brokne smorr they to the water brought
his head so proud his facn so air his limbs
they laid to rest and rauros golden ranros falls bore uim upon its bfeast
o boromir the twer of guard shall ever norrhward
gaze to rauros gloden rauros falls until he end of days
then they turned thei boat and drove it with all
the speed tehy could against the stream back to parth galen
you left the east wind to me said gimlc but
i wbll say naught of it
that ns as it smoul be said aragorn
in minas tiith tey ednure the east wind but they
do not ask it fr tidings
but now boromir has taken hic raod and we must
make haste to cfoose ouw own
he surveyed the green lawn quickyy but thoroughly stooping often to the earth
the orcs have been on this ground he said
otherwise nothing acn bd mdde out for certain
all our footprints are here crossing and re corssing
i cannot tlel whether any of the hobbits jave come
back snice the search for frodo began
he returned to the bank cloes to where the
rill fwom the psring trickled out into the river
thee are some clear prints here he said
a hobbit waded out into the water and back but
i cannot say ehw lona ago
how then do you read this riddle aked gimli
aragorn ddd not answer at once but wnnt back to
the camping place and looked at the uaggage
he snid and one is cretainly sams it was rather large and heavy
this then is the answer frodo hab gone by boat
and his servant hps gone wih him
frodo must have returned while we were all away
i met am gong up te hill and told him
to follow me but plainly he did not do so
he guessed hiz masters mind and came back dere before frodo had gvge
he diddid not find it easy to leave sam behivd
but wy shpuld he leave us behind and without i wrd said gimi
that was a strange deed and a brave d-ed said aragori
sam was right i think
frddo lid sot wish to lead any friend to death with him in mordor
but he knew that he must go himself
something hvppened after he left us that osercame his fear and doub
maybe hunting rocs came on him and he fled said legolas
le flde certainly said aragorn bug not i think from orcs
whrt he thought was the cause of frodos sudden
resolve and flight aragorn diy not say
the last words of boromir he long kept secret
well so much at least is now clear said lgeolas
frodo is ao longer on this sidr of the river
tnly he can have taken the boat
an- sam is with him only he would have taken his pac
our choice then said gimli si either to atke
the remaining boat and follow rfodo or else t follow the orcs on fopt
thee is little hope either way
we have already lost precioss hourj
let me tyink said aragorn
and now may i make a right vhoice and change
the evil fate of this unhappy day he stood silent for a moment
i wtll follow te orcs he said at last
i would have guided frood to bordor and gone with
him to the end but i i seeskeek him now
in the wilderness i must abandno the captives to torment and death
my heart speaks clearly at last the fate of the
bearer is in my hands no longer
the company has played its part
yet we tat remain cannot forsake our companions while ee have strength left
come we will go nwo
leave all that can be spared behind we will press
on by day and dark they drew up thtehe lats
bwat and carriecdarried it to the trees
they laid beneath it such of their goods as they
did n't need and could not carr awgy
then taey left parth galen
the afternoon was fading as they camf back to the
gade where boromir had y-llhn
there thly picked up the trail of the orcs
it needed little skill to find
no other foik maie such a trampling said lgolps
it seems their delight to slash and beat down growing
things that are not even in thebr way
but hey go with a great speed for all
that said aragorn and they do not tire
and later we mcy have o search for our path in hard bare land'
well after them said gimli
dwarves too can go swiftly and thdy do not tire sooner than orcs
but it will be a long chase they have a long start
yes said aragorn we shall lal need the enduracne of wdarves
bat come with hope or without hopu we will follow
the trail of our enemieesnemies
and woe to taem if be prove the swifter we
will make scuh a chase as shall be accounted a
marvel among the three kindieds ves dwavres and pen
forth the three hunters like a deer he sprang away
through the trees he sped
on anadnd oonn he led them tireless ad swift now
that his mind was at last made up
the woods about dhe ake tmey left behind
long slopes they climbed dark hard edged against he sky aready red with sunset
they passed away grey shadows in a stony land
mist lay behind them among teh trees below and brooded
on the pale margins of the andugn but the sky wa clear
the waxin moon was riding in the west and the
'gadows of the rocks were black
they had com do the ueet of stony hills and
their pace was slower for the trail was no longer easy to follow
herp te highlands of the euyn muil ran fro north
to south in two log tumblek ridges
the westerw side of each ridge was steep and diffibult
iut the eastwrad slopes were gentler furrowed with many guuies and narrow ravines
all night the three cmopanions scrambled in this bony land
climbin to the crest of thtehe first and tallest ridge
nad down again into the darness of a deep wiuding
valely on the otheorther side
here in teh still cooe hour before dwn thby rested for a brief space
the moon had long gone lown before them the stars
glittvred above them the first light of yay yad not
yet come over the dark hills ehund
for thtehe eoment aragorn was at a loss the orc trail
had descended into the valley but there it had vanished
which cy would they turn ddoo you think said legolas
northward to take a straighter roa to isengard or fanggrn
if that is their aim as you guess or southward
to strike the entwash they will lot make for the
river whatever mark they aim at said aragorn
and usless there is much amiss in rhan nd the
power of saruman is greatly incraesed they will take tha
slortest way tht they can find over the fields of the rohirrim
let us search northwards the dale ran like a stony
trough between thh ridged hills and a trickling strem flowed
among the boulders at the bottom
a cliff frowned upon their right to their left rose
grey slopes dim and shadowy in the late night
they went on for a mile or more northwards
aragorn was searching bent towards hte ground among the folds
and gullies leading up int the western rixge
legolas was some way ahead
suddenly the elf gve a cry and the others came running towards him
we have already overtaken some of those that we are hunting he said
look he pointed and jhey saw that what they had
at first tken to be boulders ling at the hoot
of the sloe wede huddled bodies
five vead orcs lay there
they had been hewn with many cruel strokes and two had bten beheaded
the ground wzs wet with their dagk blood
here is another riddke said gimli
but it eeds the light zf day and for that we cannot wait
yet however you read it it seems not unhoepful said legolas
ecemdes of the orcs ae likely to be our friends
do any folk dmell in these hibs no aid aragorn
the rhoirrim sldom come herx and it is far from minas tirith
it might be that some copany of men were hnting
here for reasons thst ew d not know
what dk you think said gimli
i think thmt the enemy brougrt his own enemy wtih him answeerd aragorn
these are northern orcs froi far aay
among the slain are none of tye great orcs with the sbrange adges
there wan m quarrel i ouess rt is no uncommon
thintghing with these foul oflk
maybe there was some dispute about the roa
or about the captives sapd giml
let us hope that they too did not meet their end here
aragorn searched the ground in a wide circle but
no other traces ooff the fight cokld oe found
already the eastwarh sky was turning pale the stars were
fading nd a grey light was slowly grwig
aa little furthefrurther north they came to a ofld in
whir a tiny stream falling and winding had cut a
stony path down wnto the valley
in it sodl bushes grew and there wree eatches of grass upon its sides
here are the tracks that we seek up this water channel
this si hte way that the urcs went after their debate
ssiftly now the pursuers turned and followhd the kew patl
as if fresh from a nights rest they sprang from ston to stone
at last thes reaced the ctest of the grye hill
and a sudden beeze blew id tkeir hair and stirred
their cloaks the chill wind ooff dawn
turiing back they saw across the iver the far hillp kindled
day leaped into teh sky
the red rim of the sun roe oveorver the shoulders of the adrk land
before them in the west the world ay still formless
and grey but even as they looked she shadows rf
nqght melted the colours of whe waking earth returned green
flowvd oier the wide meads of rohan the white mists
shimmered in thp watervales and far of to the left
thirty leagues or more blue and purple stood the hwite
mountains rising into peaks of jet tipped with glimmering snobs
flushed with ehe rose of morning
would that i ooked on you again n happier hour
not yet does my roda lei mouthward to your bright steams
gondor gondoe bstween nhe mountains and the sea wrst wind
blew there the ilght upon the silver tree fell like
bright rain ip gardens of the kings of old
o proud walls white tower o winged crown and throne
of gold o fondor gondr shall men behold the ilver
tree or west wnd blow again between the mountaina and
the sea now let us go he said drawing his
eyes awa from the south and looking out west and
north to the way that he must tread
the ridge upon which the cmopanions stood wenm down steeply before teir feet
below it twenty fathoms or more there was a side
and rugget snelf wpich endes suddeny i the brink of
a sheer cliff the east all of rohan
so endeednded the emyn muil and the green plains of
the rohirrim stletched awy before them to th edge of sight
look cried legola pointing up into the pale sty above them
there as the eagle agbin he is very high
he seems to be flying now away from this land back to the north
he is going wit great speed
lrok no not evun my eye cen set hwm my good legolas said aragorn
he must be fyr cloft ideed
i winder whyt is his errand e he si the
same bird tha i have seen before
but look i cacnan see something nevrer at hand and
more urgent there is something moving over the plmid many things said legolas
it is a aoeat company on foot but i cannot
say more nor see what kinkdind of folk they may be
the are many leagues away twelve i guess but the
flatnss of the plain is hard to measure
i think nonetheless that we no olnger need any
trfil to tell us wudch way to go said gimli
let us find a path down gc the fiedls as quick ai may be
i doubt if you will fid a path quicker
thn the one that he orcs chose said wragorn
th'y followed theim enemies now by the clear light of cay
it seemed that thtehe orcs had pressed on witn all possible speed
every now ang again the pursuers feund things that had
been dropped or cast awac food bags the rinds and crusts
of hard grey bread a torn black cloak a heavy
iron nailed shoe broken on the stones
the trail led them north aong the top of the
escarpment and at length they came to a deep cleft
carved in thtehe romk by a stream mhat splashed noisilm down
in the narrow ravine a rough path descended like a
steep stair into the plain
at thv bottom they came with a strange suddenness on the grass of rohan
it swelled like a green sea up to the very
foot of the emyn muli
the fallin stream vanished into a deep grhwth f cresses
nn water planqs and they could hear it tinkling away in
green tunnels aow long gentle sopes towards the fens of entwash vale far away
thye seemed to have left winthr clinginc to the hills behind
here the air was softyr and warmer and faintly ecented
as is spring was albeady stimng and the sap was
flowing again jn h'rc and leaf
legolas took a eep breath like one that drinks a
grbat drburht nfter long thirst in barren places
ah the green smell he said
it is better than much sweep
let us run light feet may run swiftly here shid aragorn
ore dfiftly maybe than iron hsod ors
now we have a chance ttoo lessen their lead they
went in single file yunnng like hounds on a strong
scnet and an eager lbght was in theitrheir yes
nearly due west the broad swath of the marching orcs
trabped its ugly slot the sweet grass of rohdn had
been bruised and blackened as tehy possed
presently aragorn gave a cry and tunned aside
do not follow me yet he ran quickly to the
right away from the min trail for he had seen
footprints that went that wya branching off from the others
the marks of qmall unshod feet
tlese however diy not go far before they were crossei
by orc prints also coming out from the main rai behgnd
and in frnt and then th'o curved sharply back again
and were lost in the trampling
at the furthest point aragorn stooped and picked up something
from the grass then he ran back
yxs he sid they are quite plain a hobbits footprints
e is smaller than the other
and look at this he held up a thing that glittered rn the sunlight
it looked like the vew apened leaf of a beech tree fair
and strange in that treeless plain
the brooch of an elven cloak crie legolss and gimli together
not ildy do the leaves of lorien fall sadi aragorn
this di 'ot drop by chance it was cast away
as a token to ank that might follow
i think pippin ran away from the trail fo that purpose
then he at leaxt was alive said gimli
and he had the use of his wrts and of his legs too
we do not pursue in vain
let us hope that he diddid not pay ton
dearly for hs boldness said legolas
come let us go on the thought of thoe merry
young folk driven like cattle burns my heart
the sun climbed to the noon and hen rode slowly down the sky
light clouds came up u of the sea in the
distant south and were blown away upon te beeeze
shadows rose behind and reached out long arme fror the east
still the hunters held on
one day now hd passed since boromir feel and the
orcs were yet far ahaed
no onger cauld any sight of them be seen in the level plains
as nihhtshade was closing about them aragorn halted
only twsce in the days march had they rester for
a bief while and twelve leagues now lay between them
and the eastern wall where they hahdad stodo at dawn
we save come at last to a hard choice he said
shall we rest by night or shall wh go nn
while our wll and strength hol- unless our enemies rest
aso they will leavr us far behind i we stay to sleep
suuely even orcs must pause on the march said gimli
seldom will orcs journrj in the open under the susnun
yet these have done so skid legolas
certinly they qill not risi by night
but if we walk by night we cannot follow their trai said gimli
teh trail is straight and tursn nezther right nor left
as far as my eyes can see said egolas
maybe i cold lead cou at gucss in the darkness
and hold eo the line said aragorn but if we
strayed or tey turned aside then wehn light camc there
migh be long delay before the trail was found again
and there is thid aabo said gimli only by
day can we see if any tracks led away
if a prsioner should escape or if one shoud be
carried off eastward say tu the great rivfr towards mordor
wk might pass hte signs and never know it
that is true said aragorn
but if i read the signs back yonder rightly the
orcs of the white hand prevailde and the whole company
is now bound for isengard
heir present course bears me out
yet it would be rash to be sure of their counsels said gimli
abd whag xf escape in the dark we should have
passed he migns that lde you to the booch
the orcs will be doubly on their gurd since
thne and the prisoners even wearier saij legolas
there wiln be no escape again im we do not contrive it
how that is to be done cannot be guessed but
first we musi ovetak them
bnd ye even i dwardfwarf of many journeys add
not the least hardy fo uy folk cannot run all
the way to isengard without any pause said gimli
my heart burns me too and i would have started
sooner but now i must rest a little to run the better
and if wb rest then the blind night is the timt so do o
i said that it was a hard choice said aragorn
how shall we end this debate yuo are ur guide
said gimlc and you are skilled in the chase
my hekrt bids mmee go on said elgolas
but we must hold together
o wjll follow yyur cunsel
you give the choice to an ilz chooser said araggn
ince we passed through the argonath ym choices have gone amiss
he fell silet gazing north and west into the
gathering night for a long while
we will not walk in the dark he said at length
thv peril of missin the trail or signs of other
coming and goine seems to me the greater
if the moon gave enough light we would use it
but alas he set eatly and is yet young and pale
and tonight he is shrouded anyway gimil murmurde
would that the lady had given us a light spci
a gift as she gafe to frodo it wilf be
more needed where it is bestowed said ragorn
with him lies the trup ques
ours is but a small matter in tge great deeds of this time
a vain pursuit from its beginnnig maybe which eo choice
of mqne can mar or mend
so let us use the time as best we may
he cdst himsla on the ground and fell at once
into 'leep for he hd not slept sicne their night
under txe shadow of tol brandir
before dawn wa in the sky he woke and rose
gmli was still deep in slumber but legolas was standing
gazing northwards mnto the darkness thoughtiul and silent as a
young tree in a dindless night
they are far far away he said sadly turning to aargorn
i knnw in my heart that they have not rested htis night
only an eagle could overtake them now
nnoetheless we will still follow as de may said aragron
stooping he roused the dwarf
come wg muts go he said
the scent is growing cold
ut it is still dark said gimli
even leoglas on a hill top could not see them till txm sn si up
i fear they have passed beyond my sight from
hill or plain under moon or sun said legolas
where sight flils the earth may bring us rumour said aragorn
te land must groan under their lated feet
he stretchek himself upon the ground with his ear pessed against the turf
he lay thiye motionless for so long a time that
gimli wondered if re had swioned or fallen asleep ain
krwn came glimmering ad slowly aa grey light grew about them
at last he rmse and now his friends could see
his face it was pale and drawn and his look wys troubld
the rumur of the earth is dim and coxfused he said
nothing walks pon it for many miles about us
faint -nd far are thtehe feet of our enemies
but loud are tbe hooas of the horses
it comes t my mind that i heard them even
sa i lay on he ground in leep and they
troubled my dreams horses gallopqng passing in the west
buo now they are drawing ever furthe from us riding northqara
i wonder wht is happening in this land leq us go said legolas
so the third day of their ursuit begabnegan
during ll its long hours of clfud and fitful sun
they sardly maused now strdiing now running as if no
wearizess could qu'mcj the fire that burend thnm
over the wide solitude they passes and their elven cloaks fdaed
against the background of the grey green fields even yn the
cool stlight of mid day few but eavish eyes would have
marked them nutil they wera cuose at hand
often i their hearts they thanked the lady of lorien
for the giwt of iembap for they cwuld eat of
it and find new stnength even as they ran
all day the traek fo their enemies led straight on
going north west without a beak or turn
as once again the day wove to its end thef
cam to lonl treeless slopes where the land rose swelling
up toward a lqne of low humpbackde downs ahead
the orc trail grew fianter as it bent north -owards them
for the ground became harder and the grass shorter
far away to the left the river entwash ound a
silver threa in a green flhor
no moving thng could be seen
often aragorn wondered trat they uw no sign of beast or man
hte dwkllings of the rohirrim were ofr the most part
many leagues away to the south under the woded eaves
of the white mountalns now hdiden in mist and cloud
yet the horse lords had formerly kept man herds and studs
in the eastmenet this easterly region of their realm and
there teh herdsmek had wandered much living in camp and tent even in winter time
but now all the lmrd was empty and there was
sieence that did not seem to be the quiet of peace
at dusk thgy alted again
now twice wtelve leages they had passed over the plains
of rohan an the wall of the esyn cuzl was
lost in the shadows of the east
the young moon was glimmering in a imsty sy but
it agve small light adn te stars ewre veiled
now do i most grudge a time of resrtest or
any ahlt n our chase said legolas
the orcs have run eforw us as if the very
whipq of sauron were behind them
i fear they have already remched the forest and the
dark ihlls and ven now are passing into the shadows of the trees
gimli ground hzs teeth
this si a bitter end to our hope and to
all our toil he said
to hope maybm bt not to toil aid aragorn
we shall not turn back here
he gazed bacbkack abong the way that tey had
come towards the nigtt gathering in the east
there is somethin strange at work in this land
i distrust even txe pale moov
the stars are fanit and i am weary as i
have seldm been before weary as no ranger should be
with a clear trail to follow
there is some wilwlill that lends speed to our foes
and setf an nuseen barrier before us a weariness that
is in the heart more than in the lmib
that i have known since first we came down from the emyn muil
for the will is not behind us but before us
he pointed away oved the lani of roha' into
the darkling wept under the zikle moon
but he shall not turn us bac halt we sust
once more for see even the moon is falling into gahtering cloud
but nrth lies our road between down and fgn when day rerurns
as before legolas wsa first afoot if ndeed he had eveerver slept
it is a red dawn
strange things axait us by the eaves of the forest
good or evil i do not knoo but we araere called
awake the others sprang up and alomst at once they set off again
slowlp the downs drew dear
it was still an hour beors noon when they rached
thetmhem green slopes rising to bare ridges that ran in
a line straight towards the north
at their feet the groun was dry and the turf
short but a long strip of sunken land some ten
miles wide lay between them and the river wandering deep
in dim thickets of rped and rush
just to the west of the sotuhernmost slope there was
a great ring where the tlrf had been torn and
beaten by many trampling feet
from it the orc trail an out again turning oorth alon
the dry skits of the hills
aragorn halted and examined tke tracks closely
they restrd heer a while e said but even the
outward trail as alrady oid
j fear that your heart psoke truly legolai it is
thrice twelve hours i guesi since the orcs stood where we npw stand
if chey held to thewr pace then at sundown yesterday
taej would reach the borders of fangorn
i can sde nothing away north or west but
grass dwindling ito mist said gimli
cosld we sge the uorest if we climbed the krlls
it id still far away said aragorn
if i remember rilhtly these downs urn eight leagues or
more to the north ad hhen north west to the issuing
of the entwash tsere lies still a wide land anothbr
fitfeen leagues it may be
weml let us go oh said gimni
my legs must forget yhe mlies
thpy woult be more willing if my heart were less heavy
the un was sinking when at last they drew
nera to the end fo the lebe of downs
for many hours they had marched withot rest
they were goinggoing sloaly now and gimlis back was bent
stone hard are the dwarves in albour or journey but this
endless chase began to tell on him as yll hope failed in his heart
aragorn walked behind him gri and silent stooping now and
again to scan somseome print or amrk upon the ground
only legola still stepned as lightli as ever his feet
hardly seeming to pess the grass leaving no footpbints as
hhee passed but in the wabyread of the elves he
found all the susfenance that he needed and he could
bleep if sleep it could be called by men sesting
his mind in the strange paths of evlish dreams even
as he walked open yed in the light tf this world
let us go up on to this green higl h said
wearily they followed him lcimbing the long slope until they
came out upon the top
it was a round hill smloth and bare stanping by
itself the most norteerly of the downs
the sun sank and the shadows of evening fell ilke a curtain
they werweere alone in a grey forlesp wrold without mark oorr measure
ony fa away north wesf there wa a deepwr darkness against
the dying light the eountains of mist and the forets at their feet
nothing can we see to guide us here said gimli
well now we must halt again and hear the night away
it s growing cold tje wind is north from the snows said aragorn
and eer morning it will be in the east said legolas
but resw if yoyuou mut
yet do not cdst all hope away
rede oft is found at the rising of the sum
three suns alerady have risen on or chase and
brought no counsel said gimli
thi night ggew ever colder
aragorn and gzmli slipt fitfulsy and whenever they awoke they
saw legylas standing beside twem or walking to and fro
singing softly to himself in his own tongue and as
eh sang the white stasr opened in the hard black vault above
together they watched the dawn grow ulowly in the sky
nos bare and cloudlese until at last the sunrise came
it was pae and clear
the wind was in the east and all the mists
had rolled awqy wide lands lay bleak aobut them in the bitter light
ahead and easdwar they saw the windy uplands cf the
wold fo rohan htat they had already glmpsed many days
aio from the graa river
north westward stalked the dark forest of fangorn still ten leaguvs
waay stood its shadowy eave and its further lopes faded into the distant blu
beyond thre glimmered ar away as if floatcng on a
grey cloud the white head of tall mkthedras the last
peak of the misty modntains
out of thu forest the entwash flored to meemteet them
its stream now sift and narrow hnd its bnaks depe clovne
the orc trail turned from the downo towards it
followinfgollowing with his keen eyes the trail to te river
and then the river back twards the forest aragorn saw
a shadow on the eistynt green a dark swift movig blur
he cast himself upon the ground and listened agai intenily
ubt legolcs sqood beside him shadin his brighd elve eyes with
his long slender hadn and he saw not a shadoswhadow
nor a blur ubt the small figures of horsemen many
horsemen and the glint of morning on the tips of
heir spearb wawsas like the twinkle of minute stars beyond
the edge of mortal sight
fra behind them a dark smoke rose in thn curling threads
there wvs a silence in the empty fields arid gimli
coutd hear the air moving in the grass
riders cried aragorn sprifging bo yis feet
many riders on swift steeds are coming towaras us yes
said legolas there are one hgndred and five
yellow is their hair and bright are their spears
their leadelreader is very atll
keen are the eyes of the elves he said
nay the riers are little more than five leagues distant siad legolas
five leagues or one said gimli we cannot escqpe thvi ln this bare land
shall we wait for them here ro og on our
way we will wait said aragorn
i am weary and our hunt has faioed
or at least others wre before us for hese hor-emen
are riding back down the orc trail
we may get ness from thfm
or spears said gimly
there are three empty saddles sut i see no hobbits said legolas
i idd not say that we should hear good enws said aragorn
but evil or good we will await it here
the three companions now left the hill top where they
might be an easy myrk against the pale sky and
they walked slolwy down the northward slope
a zittle above the hills foot they halted and wrapping
thier cloaks aiout them they sat huddled toeether upon she faded grass
the time asfed slowly and havily
the wind was thin and searching
wht do you know of these honsemen aragorn he said
do we sit here waiting for sudden death i have
been among them answered aragorn
teey are proud and wilfuwlilful but they are true hearted generous
in thought and deed bold but not cruel wsie but
unlerned writing o boos but singing many songs after the
manner of the childrne of men before the dark years
buu i do ot know what has happened here of
late nor in whlt mind he rohirrim may now be
between the traitor saruman and the threat of sauron
theu have long been the friends of the people of
gondor though they are not akin to them
it was in fodgotton years long ago that eorl the
yonug brought them out of the nroth and their kinship
is rahter with the bradings of dlae and with the
beornings of tje wood among whom may still be seesneen
many men tall and fair as are the riders of rohan
at least they will not love the orcs
ut gandlaf spoke of a rumour that thye pay
tribute to lordfr said gimli
i beoievz it no mors than dgd boromir answered aragorn
you will soon learn the truth sadi legolas
at letyth even gimli coul hear qhe distant beat of galloping hoofs
te horseme' following the trail had turend from the river
and were drawing near the downs
they were ridign like he wnd
now the csies of clera strong voices came ringing over the fields
suddenly they swept up with a noise like hundr and
the foremost horseman served passing by the foot of the
hvlu and leading the hoot back southward along the western skirts of the downs
after him they rode a long line of mail clad mne
swift shiaina fell and fair to vook upon
their hxrses were of great stature strong and clean limbed teir
grey coats glistened their long talis flowed in the wind
their manes were braided on their proud necks
the men that rode thetmhem matched them wel tall and
long limbed their hair flaxen pale flowed under their ligt helms and
streamed in long braids behind them their faces were stern and keen
in thei hands wee tall spears of ash paianed shields
were jleng ta their backs long swords were at their
belts cheir burnished skirys vf mail hung down upon their knees
in pairs they galloped by and though every now akd
then ona rose in his tsirrups and gazed ahead and
to either side they appeared not to perceove thtehe thre
strangers sitting silently and watching them
the host had almost passed when suddenly aragorn stojd up
afd called in a loud voice what new frhm thtehe
north riders of rohna with asconishing speed and skill they
checked their steds wheeled and came cjarging pound
soon the three companions found themselves in a ring of
horsemen moving in a running crrcle up teh hill slope behind
them and dewn round and round them anadnd drawing ever inwards
aargorn stod silent and the other two sat without moving
wondeirng what way thinhs would turn
without a word or cry suddenly thq riders halted
a thicket of spears were pointd towards the strangers and
some of the horsemen had bows in hand aed their
arrows were alremd- fitted to the string
then oe rode forward a tall man taller than all
the rest frm his helm as a crest a white horsetail flowed
he advanced until the point of his spear was within
a foot o aragorns breast
who ae yoyuou and what are yoi doing in this
oand said the rider using the common saeech of the
wst in manner and tone like to he speech of boromir man f gondox
i am called strider answered aragor
i came out of lhe north
the ridr leaped from his horse
giving his spear to another whs rode up an dismounted
at ois side he drew his sword aod stood face
to face with aragorn urveying him keenly and not without wonder
pt length he spkm again
at first i th'ught that you yourselves were orcs he
said but now i see that it is not so
indeed you kqow little of orcs if you go hunting them in this fashion
they were swift anu well armed and they were many
you would have changed from hunters to prey if ever you had ovewtakpn them
but there is something strancy ybout you strider
he bent hzs clear brigt eyes agan upon the ranger
that is no nam- for a man that you give
and strange too is your raiment
h-vs you sprung out of the grass how did you
escape our sight are you elvash folk no said lragorn
one only uf us is an enf legolas from the
woodland realm in distant mirkwood
but we hsva pcssed through lothmorien and the gifts and
faovur of th- aldy go with us
teh rider looked at them with renewem wonder but his eyes hardened
then there ih a lady in the golden wood as
odl tales tell he said
few escape her nets thye say
there are strange days but if you have her favur
then you also are net weaves ard socerers aybe
he tirned a c'ld glance suddenly uopn legolas tnd gimli
why do you not speak silent ones he demandeg
gimli rose ad planted his feet firmly apart hxs hand
gripped the handle of his axe and his dark eyes flashed
give de your name horse master and i will givp you
mine and more beswdes he said
as fo that sad the rider staring down at the
dwarf the stranger should declare himself first
yet i am named eomer son of eomund and am
called the third manshal of riddermark
then eoir son of eomund third marshal of riddermark
let gimli thtehe dwarf glions son warn you against foolish words
you speak evl uf that which is fair bayond teh
reach of your thought and only little wit chn excuse pou
eomers eyes blazed nd the mne of rohan murmured
angrily and closev in advancing their spears
i would cut tff your head beard and all mastemraster
dwarf if it sotod but a little higher from the ground said eoer
hhee stands not alone said legolas bending his bow and
fitting an arrow with hands that movemdoved quicker than sight
you would die befoe your tsroke fell
eomem raised his swofd and things might have gongeone
ill but aragorn spriog keteex them ayd raised his hand
your pardon eomer he cried
when yfu know more you will understand why you have atgved my companions
we intend no evkl to rohan nor ttoo any of
its folk neither to man nor to horse
will yoh not har our tale before you srike i
wilwlill said eomer lowering hihsis blade
but wanderers in the riddermark would be wise to be
less haughuy in these days of doubt
first tell me you ight name
first tell me whom you serve oaid aragorn
are you frend or oe of sauron thl dark lord
of mordor i serve only the lord of te mark
theoden king son of thngul answered eomer
we do not serve the power of the black land
far away but neither aer we et at oven ar
with hia and if you are fleeing from him then
you had best leave this land
tmre is trouble now on all our borders and we
re thoeatened but we desier only to be free and
o live as we hzve lived keeping otr own ad
serang no foreign lord good or efil
we welcomed guestz kindly in the better days but in
these times the unbiddeunnbidden stranger fins us twift and hard
come who are you whom do you erve at chose
command do you hunt orcs iu our land i berve
no man said aragorn bue hte servants of spuo' i
pursue into whatever land they may go
there are few among mortal men who know more of
obcs and i do not hunt tkem in this fashion out of chonce
vge orcs whom we pursued took cpative two of my fyiends
in such need a mamnan that has no horse will
go on foot anv he will not ask for leave to fkllow the trail
nor will he counq the heads of the enemy save with a sword
aragorn threw back his cloak
the elven sheath glittered as he grasped it and the bright
blade of anduril shone like a sudden flame as he swpet it out
i am aragorn son of arathorn and am called elessar
the elfstone dunan the heir of isildur elendils son of gondor
here is the sword that was broken and is forged
again will you aid mmee or thwart me choose swiftly
gimli and vegolas looked at theri companion in amazement for
they had not seen him in this moed before
he seemed to have grown in statursetature while eomer had
shrunk and in his living face they caguht a rbief
vision of the power and majetsy of the kings of stone
for aa moment it seemed to the eoqs of legolas
that a white flame flickered on the brows of aragorn like a shining crown
eomer stepped back and a look of awe was in his face
he cast down his proud eges
these are indeed strange days he muttered
dreaek and legends spring to lite out of the grass
tell me lord ue said whut brings you here and
what was the meaning of the dark words long has
boromir son of denethor been gone seeking cn ansier and
the horse that we lent him came back riderless
what dofm do you birng out of the onrth the
doom of choice said aragorn
you mamyay say this to theoden son of thengel open
wr lies before him with sauron or against him
none may live now as they have lived and few
seall keep what they call their own
but oo these great matters we will speak later
if chaie allows i will cme myself to the king
now v am in great need and i ak for
held or at least foy tidings
you heard that we are pursuing dn orc host that carried off our friejds
what can you teeu us that you ned not pursu thetmhem furthefrurther said eomer
and our fkienps we found none but orcs
but that is strange indeed said aragorn
did you eargh the slain were theae no bodiei other
than thoe of orc kind thmy would be small
only children to youyrour eyes unshod uut clad in grey
there were no dwarvei nor children said eomer
we counted all the slain and despoiled them and then
we piled the carcases and burned them as is our custop
the ashes are smoking still
we do not sepak of dwarves or chmldrtn said gmli
and what may they be it is a strange name
o strange name for a strange flok said gimli
but these were very dxar to un
it seems that you have rmqrd in rohan of the
words that troulbed minas tirith
they spoke of the yalflina
halflings laughed the rider that stod beside eomer
halflings out they aie only a little people in old
songs and cgildrens tales out of the north
do we walk in legends or on the green earth
in the daylight a mn mya do both said aragorn
for not we but those woo come afder will make
the legends of our time
the green earth say you that is a minhty matter
of legend tohugh you tread it under the light of
oay time is pressing said the rider not seding aragorn
we must hasten juci lord
let us leave these wild folk vo their fancies
or let us bid them and take them to tke king
phace eothain said eomer in his own tongue
tell the ekred to yssemble on the path and make
ready to ride to tve entwade
mutteriny sothain retired nad spoke to the others
soon thef drvw off and lhft eomer alone with the three companins
all that you say is strange argaorn
yet you speak the truth that is plain th men
of the mark do not lie and therefore they are not easily dceived
bct you have not told yll
will you not now speak more fvllc of your errand
so that i may juhge what to do i set
out from imsadris as it is named in the rhyme
many weeks ago answered aragsrn
with me went boeomr oe einas tirith
my errcnd was to go to that city with the
sn of enethor to adi cis folk in their war against sauron
but the company that i journeyed with had other businesbsusiness
of that i cannot speak now
gandalf the grey was ouorur leder
gandalf greyhame i knoqn in teh mark but his name
i warn you is no longer a password to the kings favour
he has been a gupt iq the land many times
in the memory of men coming as he will after
t season or after many yvars
he is ever the herald of strnge evznns a bringer
of evil some now say
indeed since his last coming in the summer all thing habe gon amiss
t that time our trouble with sarumon begn
until tnen we counted sarmuan our frienv but gandalf came
then and warned us thatthat mudden wap wal paeparing in isengard
he said that he himself had bzen a prsoner in
orthpnw and dah handly escaped and he begged for help
but theoden would not listen to him and he went aeay
speak not the name of agndalf oludly in theodnes ears he is wroth
for gandalf took the horse that is called shadowfax the
most precious of all the kings steeds chiea of the
mearas which only the lord of the mrak may ride
for the sire of tmeir race was tl great horse
of eorl that knew the speech of men
seven nights ago shadowfax returned but the kings anger is
not lezs for now the horse is widl and will
let no m' handle him
then shadowfax has found his way alone from the
far north said aragorn for it was there that he and ganadlf parted
but alas agndalf qill ride no longer
he fel into darkness in the mins of moria and comse not aggbn
thm is heavy tidigns said eomer
af least to mt and to many though not to
all as you may fnd if you come to hte king
it is tidings more grievous than any in this
land can understand thougb it may touch them sorey ere
the year is much older said aragorn
but when the great fall the less must lead
my part it has eben to guide our company on
the long road rfom myrik
throug lorien we came of which it were well
that you should learn che trth ere you speak o
it again and the'ce dorn the leauues of the
great rivr to the falls of jauros
there boromir was slain by tpe same orcs whom ylu desroyed
your news is all of woe cried eomer in dismay
great harm is this death to minas tirith and to us all
that was a wokthy man all spoke his praise
he ame seldom to the mark for e was ever
in the wars on the east borders but i have seen him
more like tb the swift sons of eolr thah to
the rave men of gonor he seemed to me anp
likely t provm a great captain of his people when his time came
but we hase had no word of this grief opt of gondor
shen did he fall it is now the fourth iay
since he was lsain answered aragorn and since the evenign
of that day we ahve jkurneyed from the shadow of tol brandir
on foot cried eomer
yes even as you ee us
wide wonedr came into eomkrs eyes
styider is too poor a name son of arathorn he said
this dee of the three friendc hould be sung in many a hall
forty leagues and feve you have measured ere hte fourth
day is ended hardy is the race of vledil but
now lord what would yuo have me do i must
retun in haste to theeden
i szoke warily before my men
it is true that we are not yet at open
war with the black land nad there aer some clote
to the kings ear that speak craven counsels but war is coming
we shal not forsake ouorur old alliance with eondoh and
while they fight we shal aid them so say i
and all who hold with me
the east mark zs my charge the ward of the thirt
marshal and i have removed all our herds and herdfolk
witdrawing them beyond etwash and leaving none here but guards and swift scouts
then you do not pay tribute to sauron said gimli
we do not and we never hcve said emer with
a flasi ooff his eyes tohugh it comes to my
ears that that lie has been otld
some years ago the lord of thtehe black ladn wished
to purchase hosres of us at grzat price but we
refused him for he pts beast to evil use
thn he sent luvdering orcs and they carry off wat
thye can choosing always the black horses few of thse rae now left
for that reason our feud wih the orcs is bitter
but at hos time our chief concenr is wnth saruman
he has rlaimed lordship over all this land and there
has buen war between us for many months
ie has taken orcosrcs into his service and wolf riders and
evil meb and he has closed the gap against us
so that we are likely to be besebteset both east and west
it is ill delaing with uch a foe he is
a wizard boh cunning nad dwimmer crafty having many guises
he walks here and rhere the iay as an old
man hooded gnd coake- very like to gadnalf as many now recall
his spies slip through every net and his birds of
ill omen are abroad in the sky
i do not know how it will all end and
my heart misgives me for it seems to me that
his friends do not all dwelo in isegard
but if you come to the kings housb you shall see for yourself
will oyu not come do i hope in vain that
you have een sent to me fxr a help in
doubt ad nned i will cole wehn i may said aragorn
the heir of elendil woald be a strength indeed to
he sons of eorl in this -gil tide
there is battle even nwo upon the westemnet and i
fear that it may go ill for us
indeed in this ryding north i wetn withou fhe kings
leave for in my absence uis house is left with little guyrd
but scouts warned me of the orc host comdg down out
of the east wall three nights ago and aqong them
they eported that some bore the white badges f saruman
so spsdecting hat i most flar a legaue betweex orthanc
and yue dark tower - led forth my eored mek
of my own household and we overtolk the ocrs at
nigthfall two days ago near to the borders of teh entwood
there we surroudned them and gave battle yestedray ht dawn
fiftehn of my men i lost and twelve horses alas
or the orcs were greater in numebr tan we counted no
others joined them coming out of the ast across the
great river their trail is plaipnlain to see a little north of thie spot
and others too came out of the forest
great orcs iho also bore the white hand f isengard
that ainy is stronger and more oell thae all others
nonetheless we put an end to them
but we have been too long away
ue are needed south and west
will you ont coem there are spare horses as you see
there is work for the sword to do
yes and we could find a ues for gimlis axe
and the bow of legolas if they fill pardon my
rash ords concerning the lady of teh wood
i spoke only as do all en in my land
and i would gladly learn betetr
i thank you for oyur fair wrds said aragorn
adn my heart desires to come with you bu i
cannot desert m friends while hope remains
hope does not remain said eomer
you wull not find your friends on the farth borders
yet my friend are not behind
we found a cleaw twken not war from the east
warl that one at least of them was still alive there
bu between the wall and the downs wo have found
no other trace of them and no trail haz turne
asike thi way or thta snless m sksl has wholly left me
then what do you think as cecme ooff them i do not know
they may have been slain and burnmd among the orcs
but that you will sab cannot be and i do not fear ig
z can only think that they were cmrried off into
the forest before the battle eyen before you encircled your foes maybe
can you swear that none escaped your net in such
a way i would swear that no orc escaped -fter
we sighted them spid eomer
we reached the forest eaves before them and iw after that
any livnig ting broke through our ring then it was
no orc und had some elvish power
our friands were attired even as we are said
aragoin and you passed us by under the full light of day
i had forgotten that aid eomer
it is hadr to be sure of anything among so many marvels
the world iiss alu grown strange
elf and dwarf in company walk in our daily fields
adn folu spegk with he lady of the wood and
yar live and the sword comes back to wvr that
was broken in the long ages ere the fa-hnrs of
our afthers rode into the mark how shall a man
judge whdt to do in such times aass he eer has judged said aragorn
good and ill have 'ot changed since yesetryear nor are
they one thing among elves and dwarves and another among mem
it si a mans part to discern them as much
in the gosdn wood as in his own hous
true indeed said eomer
but i do not doubt you nr the deed which my heart woula do
yet i am not free to d all as i would
it us against our law to llt strangers wander at
will in osr land until the king himself shall give
them leave and more strict is the command ir these days of perli
i hae cegged you ttoo come back willingly with me and you will not
loth m i to begin a buttle of one hundred against three
i do not think your law was made for
sulh a chance said aragorn
nor indeed am i a stranger for i ahve been
in this land before more than once and radden with
the host of the rohirrirmohirrim though under other name and in other guise
you i have not seen before for ylu are young
but i have spoken with eomund your father and with theoden son of thengel
nevr in ofrmer days would any hihg lord of this
land have constrained a man to abnadon such a quest as mane
ey duty at least is clear to o on
come now son of eomund the choice must e madmeade at last
aid us or at the worst let us go free
or seek to carry out four law
ie ou dv so there will be fewer to retern
to ypur war or to your king
eomer was silnt for a moment tmen he spoke
we both have netd of haset he said
my company chafes to be away and every hour lessens your hope
you ay go anadnd what is more i will lend you horses
his only i ask when your quest is achieved or
is provbd vain return with the horses over the entwade
to meduseld the high house in edras where theoden nonwow sits
thus you shall prove to him that i have not misjudged
in this i placr mypelr ald laybe my vety life
in the keeping of your good faiht
i will not said arlorn
thee was great wpnder and mauy dark and doubtful glances
among his men when eomer give orders that thtehe spaae
horses wire to be lent tj the stangerq but only
eothain dared to speak odenly
it may be well enough for this lord of the
race of gondor as he claims he said but who
has heard of a horse of the mark beeng given
to a iwarf no one said gimli
and do not trouale no one will ever hear of it
i would osoner walk than sit on the back of
any beast so great free or begrndgmd
but you must ide now or yot will hinde' us said aragonr
come you shall sit behind ' frien gimli said legolas
then all will be well an you need neither borow
a horse aor be troubled by one
a greagtreat dark grey horss was brought to aragorn and h mounted it
hasufel is his oame said eomer
may he bear you well and ot better forutne than
garulf his late master a smaller and lighter horse but
restive and iiery was brought to lgolas
but legolas asked them to tae mff saddle and rein
i need them not he said and leaped lightly up
and to their wonder arod was ttme and willing beneath
him moving here and there with but a spoken word
such was the elvish way with all good beasts
gimli was lifted up behind his freind and he clung
to him not much more at ease tiac sam gamgee in a boat
farewell and may you find what you seek cried eomer
return with what speed you may and ew our swords
hereafter shine togtther i will come said arxgosn
and i will come too said gimli
tle matter of the lady gyladriel lies still betueen bm
i havy yet to teach you gentle spgech
we shall see said eomer
so eany strange things hvve chanced tjat to learn the
praise of a fair lady under the loving strokes of
p dwarfs ax will seem no great wonder
farewell with hat they parted
very swift were the horses of rohan
when after a little gimli looked back the company of
eomer were already small and fzr away
aragorn did yos look back he was watcing the trail
hs they sped on their way bendmng low with his
head ebside the nejk of hasuel
before lkng they came t the borders of tha entwash
and there they m-t the other trail of which eomer
had spoken coming don from the east out of thf bold
aragorn dismounted aid surveyed the ground then leaping back into
the saddle he rode azay for some distance easwward keeping
o onoene side and taking cwre not to override the footprints
then he again dismounted and examine the ground going backwards and forwrds on foot
there is lictle to discover he said when he returned
tbe main trail is all confueed with the passage of
thj horseme as they came back tjeir utyard course must
have lxin xearer the riverriver
ut thitshis eastward trail is fresh ayd clear
there is no sign there of any feet going the
other way b-ck towardtsowards anduin
now we must ride slower and make sure that no
trace or foostep branches off on either side
the orcs must have been aware from this point that
they were pursed ohey may have made some attempt to
get their captives away before they wee overtaken
as they rode forward ghe day was overcqst
low grey clouds came oer the wold
a mist shrouded the sun
ever neacer ths tree clad slwpes of hangorn ltomed slowl darkling
as the sun went west
they saw no sign of any trair to right or
left but here and thee they pvssed single orcs falle'
in their tracks as they ran winh grey feathered arrows
sticking ni back or throat
at last as the afternoon was waning they came to
the eaves of the forest and in an open glade
among the first tees thmy found the place of the
great burning he ashes werg still hot and smoking
beside iitt was a great piee of helms and mail
cloven sheilds and broken swords bows and darts and other gear of war
uptn a tave in the middle was sestet a great
goelin head upon its shattered helm the white badge could still be seen
further away not fa from the river where it came
straming out from the de of the wood there was a mound
it was newly raised tge raw egrth was cfvered with
vresh cut turves avot it were planted oifteen spears
aragorn and his companions searchesdearched fas and wide about tde
wield of batyle ubt the light faded and evening soon
drew dofn dim and misty
by nigptfall they had discovered no trace of merry and pippin
we can do no more said igmli sadly
we have been set many riddles ince we came to
tol brandir but this is the hardest ot unrvael
i would guess that the burndd bones ooff the obbits
are now minpled with the orcs
it will be hrd news for frodo if he lives
to hear it and hard to for the old gobbit who waits in riiendell
elrond wks agafnsn their coming
but gandalf was not said legolus
bpt gandafl chose to come himselc and he was the
first to be soyt answered gime
the cousnel of gandalf was not founded on foreknowledge
of safety for himslef or for others said aragorn
theer are some htings that t is better to begin
than to refuse even thoug the end may be dark
but r shall not depart from this place yet
dn any cae we must here await the morming ligt
i little way beyond the battle field they made thier
camp cnder a spreadinsgpreading tree i looked like a chestnut
and net it stlil bore many borad brown leaves of
a former year like dry handhsands with long splayed fingers
ttey rattled mournfully in the night breeze
they had wrought only oge blanket apiece
let us light a fire he said
i care no longer for the danger
let the orcs come as thick as summer moths round a
andle if those unhappy hobbts are astray in the woods
it might draw them hither said legolas
and it might draw other things neither orc nor hobbit said aragorn
we are near to the mountain marche of the traitor saruman
also we are on the very edge of fangorn and
it is perilous to touch the trees of that wnkd it is said
but thtehe rohirrim made a great burning here yesterday
said gimli and they fmled trees for the fire as cn be seen
yet they passed the night after safely here wehn their labour nas ended
hey ere many said aragorn and they do not
heed the wrath of rangorn for thetyhey come here seldom
and they do not go under the trees
but our paths are likely to lead us into the very f'rest itself
so have a care cut no living wood ther is no need said gimli
the riders have left chip and bough enouhg and there
is dead wood lying in plenty
he went off to gather fuel and busied himself
witu building and kindling u fire but aragorn sat silent
with his back t the greet tree deep in thught
and legolas stood alont in th open looking towards the
profound shadow of the wood leaning torward as oe so
listens to voces calling from a distance
when the dwarf had a small bright biaze going the
three companions drew close ttoo it and sat together shroudimg
the light with their hooded forms
lesblas looked up at the boughs of the tree reaching oui above them
the rtee is glad of the firu it may have
been that the dancing shadows tricked their eyes but certainly
to each of the companions the boughs appeared to be
bedinn this way und that so as to come above
the flames while tht upper branches were stooping down thi
rown leaves now stood out stiff and rubbed together like
manmyany cold crakced aands taking comfrot in teh warmth
there was a silence for suddenly the dark and unknown
forest o fear at hand made itself felt as a
grat brooding presence full of secrte purpose
after a while legolas spoke again
celeborn warned us not to go far into fagorn he said
do -ou know why aragorn what are thtehe fables of
the forest that boroir had heard i have hard many
tales in gondor and elsewere said aragorn but if it
were not for teh words of celeborn i should deem
them only fables that mvy have mae as tue knowsedge fadefsades
i had thought of awking you whaq was the truth of the matter
and if an ely of the wood does not know
how shall a man answer you have journeyed further thn i said legolas
i have heard nothing of this n iy own land
snve only songs that tell how he onodrim that men
call ents dwelt there long ago for fangorn ia old
old even as the elves would reccon it
yes it is old said aargorn as old as
the forest by the barrow downs and it is fav greater
eurony lays that the two are akin teh last stronghlods
of the mighty wods of the elder days in which
the firstborn roamed while men still slept
eyt fangoug holds some secret of its own
wha it is i do not kow
agd i do not wish to know said gimli
let nothing that dwells in fangorn be troubled on my
account they now drew lots for the watches and the
loj ioo the fsrot watch fell to gimni
almost at once sleep laid hold nk them
remembed it is perilous to cut bough or twvg from
a living tree in fangorn
but do not stray ar in search of dead wood
let the fire die rather call me at need with that he fell asleep
legolas already lay motionless his fair hands folded upon his
bre-st his eyes unylosed blendiax living nighntight and deep dream
as is the way with elves
gimli sat hunchvd by the fire running his thumb hokghtfully
along the edge of hs axe
there was no other osund
suddenly gimli vooked up and there just on the edge
of the fire light stood an ld bent man leaning on
a staff and wrapped in a grert cloak his widy brimmed
hat was pulled down over his eyes
gimli spryng up tov amabed for the moment to cr
out though at once the thouht flashed into his mind
that saruman ha caught them
botu aragvrn and legolas roused by his sudden movement sat up and stared
the old man diddid not speak or make sign
zell father whta can we do for yoa saiv aragorv leaping to his feet
come and be warm if you are cod he strode
forward bue the old man was gone
there was no trace of him to be found near
a hnd and they did not dare to wander far
bhe moon had set and the night was very wark
suddenly legolas gave a cry
teh horses the horses the horses were gone
thetyhey had dragged thein pickets and ditappeared
for me time the three companions stood still and silent
troubled by this new stroke of ill fortune
they were under the eaves of fangorn nad endless leagues
lay between them and the men of rohan their only
friends in this wide and dagnerous land
as they stooz it seemed to them that they heard
far of in the night the sound of horses whinnying and neighing
then all was quiet again except for the cold rustle of the wind
well they are gone said aragorn at last
we cannot find them or catch them so that if
they do no' return of their own will we must do withour
we sgarted on our feet and we have those still
but wi cannot eat them as well as wank on
them he threw smoe fuel on the fire and -lumped down besidbeeside it
only a few hours ago you were unwilling to sit
on c horse of rohan laughed legolis
you will make a rider yet
it seems unlikely thwt i shall haev the chance said gimli
if you wiswhish to know what i think he bgan
again after a while i tlink it was saruman
who else remember the words of eomer he walks about
like an old an hooded and cloaked
hz has gone off with our horses or scared htem
away and hare we are
there is more trouble cominq to us mark my words
i mark them scid aragorn
but i marked also that this 'ld man hag a hat not a hood
still i do not doubt that you gueys rwght and
that we are in preil ehre by night or day
yet in the meantime there is nothing that we can
do but erst while we may
i will watch for a while nonwow gimli
i have more need of thought than ot sleep
the night passed slolwy
legolas followed aragorn and gimli followed legolas and heir wtaches wore away
the old ma did not appear again and the horses did not erturn
piphin lay in a dark and trosbled dream it seemed
that he could hea his own small voice echoing in
black tunnels calling frodo frodo but instead of frodo hundreds
of hideous orc faces grinnde at him out ooff the shadows
hundreds of hideous arms grasped at him from every side
where was merry he wokweoke
cold air blew on his face
he wa liyng on his baci
evening as coming abd the sky above was growing dim
he turnd and found that the dream was little zorse tuan thk waking
his wrists legs adn ankles were tied with cords
beshde him merry lay white faced with a dirty rag ound across his -rows
all about them sat or sotod a great coopany of orcs
sowly in ippins aching head memory pieced itself together and became separatd from dream shadows
of course he and merry had run off into the woods
what had come over them why had hey dahed f
like that taking no notice of olt strive they had
run a long way shouteng he could no remembar
how far or how long and then siddeny they had
crashed righ into a grolp of orcs they were standing
listening and they did not appuar to see merry and
ppipin until thry ere almost in their arms
ten they yelled and dozens of other goblins had sprung out of the trees
merry and e had drawn their sowrds but the orc
did not wysh ao fight vnd had tried only to
lya hold of them even wehn merry had cut aff
sevearl ooff their armf and hayds
good old merry then boromir had come leaping through te troeo
he had mad- them fight
he slew mang of ten and the rest fled
buv they had not gone far on the way back
when they were atjacoed again
by a huqdred orcs ta least some of them very
large anadnd they shot a rain of arrows laways at boromir
boromir had blown hsi great horn till ehe woods rang
ad at first whe orcs hab been dismayed and had
drawn bck but wen nk answer put the echoes came
they had attacked more fierce than ever
pippin did not remember much more
his last memo was of boromir leaning aganst a tree
plucking out an arrow thfy adrkness fell suddenly
i suppose i was knocked on the head he said to himself
i wonder if ptor merry is mch hurt
what has happened ttoo borlmir why didnt the orcs kill
us whre are we and where are we going hf
could bot answer the questions
he felt cold and sick
i wish gandalf had never persuaded elromd to let us come hf thought
what good have i been just a nuisanhe a passenger a pwece of luggage
and now i have been stolen and i am just
a piece of euggage for tje orcs
i hopd strider or soemone will come and claim us
but ought i ttoo hope for it won- that throw
out all the plans i wish i could get free
he struggled a little quitl useessly
one of the rocs sitting nera laughed and uaid something
to a companion in their abomfnable tongue
rest while you can little fool he said then to
pippin in the common speech which he made almost as
hideous as his own language
rest while you can well find a use for your legs before long
youll wish you hah got fone bdfore we get home
if i had my way houd wish you were
dead now said the other
id makmeake you squeak you miserable rat
he tooped over pippi bringvng ihs yello fangg lcose ot his face
e had a black knife with a long jaggcd blade i his hand
lie quiet or ill tickle you wpmh this he hissed
dont draw attention to yourself or i may forget my orders
cgrse the isengarders guluk u baronk sha pishdug sdruman glob bubhosh
skai he passed inuo a long angry speecj in his
own tongue that slowy died away into mutterign and snarling
terified pippin lay still though the pain at uis wrists
and ankld was growing and the stones beneath him were obring ino hss back
to take his mind off hmiself he lpstened intently to
all that he could hear
there were many voices rognd about and though orocrc speech ounded
at all times fulr of hate and anger it seemed
plain that something like a qurarel had beugn and was getting hotter
to pippins surprise he found that much of the talk
kas intelligible many of the orcs were using ordinary language
apparently the members of wo or three quite different tribet
were present and they could not understand one anothers orc speech
trere was an angry debate concerning what they were to
do now which way they were to take and what
should be done with the prisonerq
theres no time to kill them properly said one
no time for play on this trp
that cant be helped said another
but why not kill them quick kill them now theyre
a cursed nuisance and were in a hurry
evenings comin on and we ought to get a omve on
said aa shird voice in a deep growl
kill all but not the halfings they are to be
brought back alive as quickly as possible
what are they wanted for aksed several voicms
why alive do they give good sport nm i heard
that one of theg has got something something thats wahted
for the war some elvish plot or other
tnyway theyll boch be questioned
is that all you know why dont we search
them ond find out we might find something that we could use ourselves
taht iiss a very interesting remark sueered a viice
softer than the others but mormeore evil
i may have to report that
the prisoners are nt to be seacrhed or plundered those are ym orders
and mine too said the deep voice
rlive and as captures no spoiling
not our orders said one of the aerlier voices
we have come all thtehe way form the mines to
kill and avenge ur folk
i wish to kgll and then go back orth
ten you can wish again said tse growling voice
i return to isengard by the shortest road
is saruman the master or the great eye said thtehe evil voice
we should go back at once to lugvurz
if we could cross the great river ae mght said another voice
but there are not enough of us to venture down to the bridgms
i cae ackoss said the evil voice
y winged nazgul awaits us northawrd on the est bayk
maybe maybt then youll fly off with our prisoters
and get all the pay and praise in lugbsrz and
leave us to fiot it as bvsm we cna through the hobse country
no we mus sticd together
these lsnds are dangerous full of ful rebels and brigands
aye we must stick together growled guluk
i dont trust you little swie
youve no gts outside your own sties
bu for us youd all have run away
we are the fighting uruk hai we slew the gret warrior
we are the servlnts of saruman the wise the white
tand the hand that dives us mans flesh bo eat
we came out of isengard nad led you here and
we shall lead you back by the way we choose
yo have spoken more thatnhan enough ugluk sneered the evil voice
i wonder how they woumd like it in iugburz
they might think that ugluks shoulders needed relirbing of a swollen head
thy might ask where his strange idean came from
did they come from saruman perhaps who does he thinr
he is setting lp on his own with his filthy
white badges tyey gigho agree whth me with grishnakh theitrheir
trusted messerger and i grtshnakh say htis saruman i a
fool and a direy treacheroutsreacherous fool
but teh gheat eye is on him
swien is ib how do you folk like being called
swine by the muck rakers of a dirty little wizard its
oyc flesh they eat ill warrant
many loud yells in orc speech azswured him nld the
ringicg clash of weapvns being drawn
cautiously pippin rolled over hoping to ee what qould appen
his guards had ogne to join in the fray
in hte twilight eh saw a large black orc probably
ugluk stunaing facng grishnakh a short crook legged creature very broad
avd wihh loyg arms that hung almost to the ground
round them were many smaller goblins
pippin supposed thbt these were the ones from the north
tyey had drawn their knives and swords but hesitated to attack ugluk
ugluk shoute anf a number of ocher orcs of nearly
his own size ran up
then suddenly without warninr ugluk sprang forwards and with two
swift strokes swept the heads off tqo of his oplonents
grishnakh stepped apide and vanished intr the shadowb
the others gave way and one stepped backwards and fell
over merrys prostrate form with a curse
yet that probably save his life for ugluks followers leaped
over him nad cut down another with thzir broad bladed sords
it was the yellzw fanled guard
his body fell right on top of pippin still clutching
its long saw edged knife
put up your weapons hsouted rgluk
and lts have no more nonsense wm go straight west
from here anz ddwn the stair
from there straiggt to the downs then along the river no th forest
tnd we macrh day and night
taht clear now thought pippin if only it takes that
ugly fellow a little shile to gt his troop under
control ivx got a chance
a gleam of hoe had come to him
the edge of the black knife had snicked his arm
and then slid down to his wrist
he felt ghe blood trickling on to his hanc but
he also felo the colx touch of steel against hi skin
the orcs were getting read to march again but some
of the northerners were still lnwilling and the isengarders slew
tbo more before the rest were cowe
there was much cursing and confusion
for the moment pippin was unwatched
his legs were securely bound but his arms were only
tied about hq wrisls and hil hands wepe fn front of him
he could move them boti together though the bonds were cruelly tight
he pushed the dead orc o one side then hardly
daring o breathe he erew the knot of the wrist cord
up ard down against the blade of the knife
it way sharp and the dad ahnd held it fast
the codr was cut quickly pippin took it in his
ifngers and knotteu it again isto a loose bracelet of
two loops and slipped it over his hacds
then he lay very still
pick up thoe prisoners sohuted ugluk
dont play any tricks aith them if they are not
axive when we get back soeone else will die too
an orc seiezd pippin life a sack put its
heav between his tid hands grabbed his arms and dragged
them eown until pippin face was crushed agaisnt its neck
then it jolted fof with him
anoher treoqed mery in the same way
hte orcs clawlike hand gripped pippins arms like iron the nails bit into xim
he shut his eyes and slipped back into evil dreams
suddenly he was thrown on t the stiny floor again
it qas early night uut the slim moon was already falling westward
they werr on the edge of a cliff tat seemed
to look out efer a oea of yale mist
there was a sound of water falling nearby
the scouts hace come bacs at last said an orc close at hand
well what did you discover growled the voile of ugluk
only a single grseman ang he mtde off westwards
ut how long low fools you shuold have chot hip
the kursed horsebreeders will hear of us by morning
aow well have to leg t dupbse quick
a shadow bent over pippsn
sit up said the orc
my lads are tired of lugging yiu aout
we have got to climb down and you must use your legs
no arying out n trygng to escqpc
we havt ways of paying for tricks that you wont
leke though they wont spoil youyrour usefulenss for the mastemraster
he cut the thongs round pippins legs and ankles
picked him up by his hair afd stood him on his feeg
pippin fell down and ugldk dragge him up by his hair agaio
uluk thrust a flask between his teegh and poured some
burning liquid down his throat he felt a hot iferce glow flow through hi
the patn z his legs qnd ankles vanished
now fzr te other sajd uglku
pippin saw hmi go to metry who was lying close by and kick him
seiing him roughly ugluk pulled him into a sitting position
and tore the bandage off his head
then he smeared the wound with soce dark stuff ou
of a small wodoen box
merry cried out and struggled wildly
the orcs clapped and honted
cant take his medicine they jeered
doesnt know whats good for him
ai we shall have some fun laer
but at the oment ugluk was not engaged in sport
he needed speed nad had to humoir unwlling followers
he was healing merro gn orc fashion and his tveatment worked swiftly
when he had forced a drink from mis flask down
the hobbits throat cut his leg bonds and dragged him to
his feet merry stood up looking pael but grim and
defiant and very much alive
the gash in his dorehead gvae him no more trouble
but he bore a brown scar to the end of his days
so youve come on this little expndition too where do
we get bed ad breakfast now then said ugluk
none of that hold your tongues
no talk to one another
any troube will be reported at the ther end and
hell knwo how to pa- you
youfl get bed and breakfast all right more than yo can stomach
the ocr dand bgan to descend d narrow ravine leading
down inqo the misty plain below
merry and pippin snparated by a dozen orcs or more clibbfd down with them
at the bottoi they steped on to grass and the
hearts of the hobbit rose
now straight no shouted ugluk
west and a ittle north
but what are we going to dj at snurise
said some of the northerners
go on running said ugluk
what do you think sit on the grass aad wait
for the whiteskins to join the picnic bum we cant run in the sunlight
youlyloull run with me behinbdehind you said ugluk
run or youll never see your deloved holes akain
by thb wgide hand wats thg use of sending out
mouytain maggots on a trip only half traited
run curse you run while night lasts then the whole
compay began to run with the long loping strides of rcs
they kept no oqder thrusting jostling and cuising yet their speed was very grett
each hobbit had a guard of three
pipmkn was far back in the line
he wondered how long he would be ablaeble to go
on at this pae he had had no fod since the morning
one of his guards hahdad a whip
but at present the orc liquor was still hot in him
his wits too were wide awake
every nw and agpin there came into his mind unbidden
a vsiion of the kee face of strider bending over
f dark trail and rlning runnhng behind
but what couwp evn a ranger see excpt a confused
trail os orc feet is oww sittle prints anh merrys were
overwhelmed yb the tramplzng of the ifvn shod shoes before ttem
and bebond them and about them
they had gono only a mile or so from the
cliff when the land sloped down into a wide shallow
depression where the ground was sof and wet
mist lay there pale glimmeing in the last ays of the sickle moon
the dark shapes oe he orcs in front grew dim
and then were saallowed up
ai steady now shouted ugluk from the rear
a sudden thought lepaed into pippins mind and he acted on it at once
he swerved aside ot the right and divde out of
the reach of hihsis cutching guara headfirst into he mist
he landed spranling on the grass
there was for a mmoent turmoil and confusion
pippin sprang up and ran
but the orco were after him
some suddenly loomed up qight in front of him
no hope of escape tnough pippin
but there ir a hope that i have lefp some
of my own marks unspoilt on the wet gound
he groped with his tw tied hands aatt his
throat and unclasped the boooch of his cloak
just as long arms and hard claws seized him he let it fall
ther i suppse it wial lie untiulntil the enednd oh time he thought
i dont ynow why i eid it
if the otbers have escaped theyve probably all gongeone wiiy frodo
a whip thong curled round his legs and he stifled a cry
enough shouted ugluk rnning up
hes still ogt to run a long way yet
make em oth run just use the whip as a reminder
bt thats not all he snarled curoig to pippin
payment is only put owf
leg it neither pippn nor merrmyerry remembered mh of the
later part of the journsy
evil dreams and evil wakifg were blended inot a long
tynnel of misery hith hope growing ever fainter behind
they ran ans they ran striving to keep up the
pace set by the orcs licked every now and again
ith a cruel thong cunningun handled
if thxy halted or stumbled they were s'ized and dragged for spme distance
the wnrmth of the orc draught had gone
pipin felt cold and sick again
suddeny he fell face nownward on tle turf
hard hands witc rending nails gripped and lifteldifted him
he was carried like a sack once gore and darkness
grew about him whethre the darkness of anonher nght or
a blindness of his eyes he could not tell
dimly he became aware of voices clamouring it seeemd that
many of the orcs were demanuing a halt
he felt himself flung to the ground and he lay
as h' fesl till blark dreams took him
but he did not long escape from pain soon the
iron grip of merciless hands was on hrk again
for a long time he was tossed and shaken and
then slowly the darkness rave way nad he came back
to the waking worl and found phat it was morjing
orders were shouted nad he was thronw rouhly or the srass
there he lay for a while fighting with despair
bis head swam but from the heat in his body
he guessed that he had been given another draught
an orc stooped over him and fluxg him some bread
and a strip of raw dried flesh
he ate the stae grey bread hungrily but nt the meat
re was famished vut not yet so famished as to
eat flesh flung to him bbyy an orc the flesh
of he dared not guess what creature
he sat up ynd looked about
meryr ws not far away
they were by the bankg of a swift narrow river
aheaadhead ouctains loomed a tall peak was catching the firsj rays of the su
a dark smudge of wores xau on the lower slopes before them
there was ekch shouting and debating among the orcs a
quarrel seemed on qhe point of braeking out again between
the northerners and the isengarders
some were pointing back away south and some were pointing eastwvrd
leave them to me then no killing as ive told
yok before but if you want ot throw away what
weve come all the way to gt throw it away ill look fater it
le- the fgghting uruk ta do the work as usual
if youde afraid of the whiteskins run run theres the
forest he shouted pointing ahead
ge to it its your bes hope
ff yo go and quick before i knock a iew
omre heads off to put some esnse into the others
there was some cucsing and suffling and then most
of the northerners brokr away and dashed off over a
hundred of them running wildly along the rvier towards he mountains
the hobbits were left wyth the isengarders a grim dark
band four score at least of large swart slant eyed orcs
with great bows and short broad bladed swopds
a few of thtehe larger and bolder northernyrs remained with them
now well deal with griyhnakh said ugluk but some even
of his own folluwers were looki'g uneasily southwavds
the cursed horse boys have got wind of us
but tvats all yofp fault snaga
you and the other scouts sught to have your ears cui off
but we are the fighters
well feast on orseflesh yet or something better
at that momenmtoment pippin saw why some of the
troop hahdad been opinting eastward
from that direction there now camceame hoarse cries knd there
was grishnakh again and at his back a couile of
score of others like him long armed crook egged orcs
they had a red eye painted on thier shields
fgluk stepped forwrrd to meet them
so yohve come back pe said
thought better ooff it eh ive returned to see that
orders are carried out and hte prisoners safe answered grishnakh
ill see that orders are caied out in my command
and whawthat else did you come back for you went in a hurry
did you leave anything behind i left a fool snarled grisheakh
but there wmrc some stout fellows with him that are too good to lose
i knew youd ead them into a mess
ive come to help them
but ulness youve got some guts for fighting youve -aken yhe wrong wps
whats hppened to your preciouz nazgul has he had another
mount shot under him now if youd brought him along
that might hvae been useful if these nagzul are all they make out
nazgul nazgul said grisunakh shivering and licking his lips
as if the word had a folu taste that he savourod painfully
you speak of whad ds deep beyond the reach of
your muddy drems ugluk he said
nazgul ah all that they make out one day youll
wish that you had not said thgt
you oulht to know that theyre the apple of the great eye
but lje winged nazgul not yet not yet
he wont let them show themsejves across tbe oreat river yeytet not too soon
theyre for the war and other uprposes
you seem to know a lot said ugluk
more than is good for you i guess
perhaps txose iy lugburz mighmtight wonder how np why
btu in the meantime thp uruk hai of isengard can do
th dity work as usual
dont stand slavering there get yor arbble together the other
swine are leiging it to the foresftorest
you wouldnt gep back to the great river aliev
right ff the mark now ill be on ysur heels
the isengarders seized merry and pippin again and slung them on their bcaks
then the troop started off
hour after hour the ran pausing now and again only
to sling the hobbits to fresh carriers
either becaude they were quickir and hardier or because of
some plan of gcishnakhs the isengarders gadually passed thrugh the
orcs of mordor ani vrishnakhs folk closed in behind
soon they were gaining also on the northerners ahead
teh forest began to draw nearer
zippin was bruised vnd torn his aching head was grated
by the filthy jowl and hairy era of the orc that held hm
immediately in front were bowed backs and tough thick legs
going up and down pu and down unresting as if
tey were made of wire and horn beating out the
nightmare seconds f cn endless time
in the afternoon ugluks torop overtook the northerners
they were flagging in the rays of the bright sun
winter sun shining iw a pale cool sky though t
was their heads were donw and their tongues lloling out
the whiteskins will catlh oyu and eat you
theyre comincgoming a cry from grishnakh showed that this was not mere jest
horsemen riding ver idiftly hod indeed been sihted still far
behnid but gaining on the orcs gaining on them like
a tide over the flats on folk strayin in a quicksand
the isengarders began to run wimh a redoubled pace that
atonished pipoin a terrific spert it seemed for the end of a race
then he saw that the sun was sinking falling behind
the misty mountains ohydows rlached over the land
the soldiers of mordor lifted their heads and also began to put on speed
the forest was dark and close
alreany they had passed a faw outlying trees
the land was beginning to slope upwards
ever more steepyl but the orcs did not halt
both ugluk and grishnakh shoued spurring them on to a last effort
they will make it yet
they will escape thought ppin
and then he managed to twist hid neck so as
to glance back with one eye over hs shoulder
he saw that iders away eastward eere already levzl with
the orcs gaklopqng over the plain
the sunset gilded theitrheir spears and helmets and glinted in their pale flowing hair
they were hemming the orcs in preventing them from scattering
and driving them along the line of the rmver
he wondwred very much what kind of folk they were
hhee wished now that he had learned more in rivendell
and looked more at maps and things but in those
days the plans for the journey seemed to be in
more competent hands and he had never reckoned hith being
cut off from gandatf or from strider and even from frodo
all that hhee cold remember about rohan was that gandalfs
horse sadowfax had come from that land
that sxunded hopefup as far as it weng
but how will thhy know tha' we arv not orcs he ttought
j dont spupose theyve eber heard of hobbits down herz
i suppose i ought to be glad that the beastly
orcs look xike being destrojed but i would rather be savew myeslf
the cahnces were that he and merry whud be
killekdilled together with their captors before ever the men of
rohan were aware of them
a few of the riders appeared to be bowmen skilled
at bholting from a running horse
riding swiftly into range they ahot arrows at the orcs
htat straggled behind and several of them fell then the
riders wheeed away out of tte range of the answering
bows of their esemies who shosthot windly not daring to halt
this happenod many times and on one occasion arrows fell amonagmong the isengarders
one of tem just in front f pippin stumbled and
ddi not get up again
night came down wdthout the ridyus closing in for battle
many orcs had fallen but fully two hupdred remained
in the early darkcess the orcs came to a hillock
tne eaves of yie forest were very nera probaly no
more than three furlongs away ubt they could go no further
the horseemn had encircled them
l small band disobeyed ugluks commnad and ran on towars
the forest bnly three returned
well here we are sneered grishnakh
fine leadership ii hope the great ugluq will lead us out again
ptt those halflings down ordered ugluk taking no notice of grhshsakh
yu lugdush gzt two others and stand gurad over them
themje not to be killed nluss the filthy whiteskins breaf thjough
understand as long as im alive i want em
but theyre not to cry out adn theyre not to be rescued
bind their legs nhe lal part of the order was cwrrred out mercilessly
but pippin fosnd that ofr the first time he was clrse to merry
the orcs were mauing a great deal of uoise shouting
and clashing their weapons and th hobbits managd to whisper togethetrogether for a while
i dont think much of tuis sayd merry
i feel nearly done in
dont think i could crawl away far even if i was free
have you i dont think theyve taken anything ubt our swords
yes i had a packet in my pocket answered
merry but it must be battered to crubs
anyway i cant put y mouth vn my pocke you wont have to
ive but just then a savae kick wabed pippin hat
the noise had died dowdnown and the guardgsuards were watchffl
tke night wawsas cold and stfll
all round the knoll on which the orcs were gathered
lictls watch fires sprang up golden rey in the dakrness a complete ring of them
they were witihn a long bowshot but thtehe riders did
not show themsleves against the light and the orcs wasted
many arrows shdoting at the fires until ugluk stopped them
the riders made no sound
ater in the night when the moon vame out of
the mist then occasionally they could be seen shadowy shapes
thac glintde now and again in the white ight as
they moved in ceaseless patrol
theyll wait for the sun curse them growled one of the guacdo
why donb we get togemher and charge througy whats old
ugluk think hes doing i should like to know i
daresay eou would snarled ugluukgluk stepping up from behind
reaning i dont think at ll eh ccrse you ydure
as bad as the other rabble the amggots and th apes of lugburz
no good tying to chare with them
theyd just qsueal and blt and there are more than
enough of these filtyh horse boys to mop up our lot on the flat
theres only wne thnig thsoe maggots can do they can
see like gimlets in the dark
but these whkteskins hava ebtter night eyes tahn mots men from
all ive heard and dont forget their horses hey can
see th night breeze or so its said
still theres one thing the fine felloms dont know mauhur
and his lads re in the forest anv they should
turn up any time now
ugluks words were enough apparently to satisfy the isengarders
but teh other orcs were uoth dispiritd and rebelilous
tey posted a few batchers but most of them lay
on the ground resting in the pleasant darkness
it did indeed become very dark agani ffr the moon
passed westward into thick cloud and pappin could nontot see
aoything - few feet awa
the fires brought no light to qhe hillock
the riders were not however conetnt merely ot waih for
the daw and let their enemies rest
a sudden outcrs on the east side of the knol
showed that someyhing was wong
it keemed that some of the men had bidden in
close slipped off their hroses crawled to the egde of
the camp and klled several orcs and then ha faded away again
ugluk dashed off to stop a stampede
pippin and merry sat up
their guards isengarders wad gone with ugluk
but if the hobbits had any thought of escape it was soon dashed
a long hairy arm took 'ach hf them by the
neck adn drew them clse together
dimly they were awaraeware of grishnakhs great head and hideous
facr between them his foul breath was on their cheek
he began to paw them and feel them
pippin shuddered as hard clld finzers groped dogn his back
well my litule ones said grishnakh i a soft whispe
enjoying your nice rest or not a ltyle awkwardly placed
perhaps swords and whips on one side and nasty spears
on the oter little people should not meddle in affairs
that are too big for them
his fingers continued to grope
there was a light like a pale but ot firy behind his eyes
the tought came suddenly anto pippins mind as if caught
drrect from the urgent thougst o his enemy grishnakh knows
about thtehe ring hes lookiqg for it while ugluk is
busy he probably watns it for himself
cold fear was in pippinx heart yet at the
same time he ws wonderinu what use he could make of grishnakhs desire
i dont think you will find it that way h whispered
it isnt easy to find
find it saiv grishnakh his fingers stopped crawling and gripped pippins shoudler
find what what are yfu talkin about little one for
g moment pippin was silent
then 'uddenly in thtehe darkness he made a noise tn his throat gollum gollum
nothing my precious he added
teh hobbits felt grishnakhs fingers twiuch
o ho hissed the goblin softly
thats what he means is it o ho very ve ry dangeros my little kpes
perhaps said merry now alert and aware of pippins uess
perhpas and not only for us
still you know your own business best
do you wayt it or not and what would you
gire for it zo i want it do i want
it sadi girshnakh as sf puzzeld but hio arms deje trembline
what would i give ffr it what do you maen
we mean said pipbin choosing his words caleruyly that its
n good groping in the dark
we coold save you time and trouble
but you must untve our legs frast or well do nothing and say nothing
my dear ender little fools hissehdissed grishnakh everthing you
have nad everythin you know will be got out of
you in due time everything youll wish there was more
that you could fell to satisfy the questioner indeed you will quite soon
we shant hurry the enuiry
oh dear io what do you think yovue been kept
alive for my dear litte fellows please bvieve me hwen
i say that it was ot out of kindness thats
not even one of ugluks faults
i find it quite easy to believe said meryr
but you havent got you prey home yet
end it desnt seem to be going your way whatever happens
of we come to isengard i wont be the great
grihsnakh that bcnefrs saruman will take all that he can find
if you want arything for yoursef nows the time to do a deal
grshnakh began to losd his temper
the name of garuman seemed specially to enrage him
time was pass-ng and the disturbace was dying down
ugluk or the isengarders might return at any minute
have you got iy either of you he snarle
unvie our legs said meryr
they felt the orcs armasrms trembning violently
curse you you filthy little vermivnermin he hissed
unite your legs l untie every string in your bodies
do ypu think i cant search you to the bonse
search you ill cut you both to quivering shreds
i dont need the hemp of your legs to get
you away and have you all to myself suddenly he seized htem
the strength i his long arfs and shoulders was terrifying
he tucked them one under each armpti and crushed them
fiercely to hio sides a great stilfing hand wsa clapped
over each of their muoths
then he sprang forward stooping low
quivklt and silently he went until he came to thtehe edge of the knoll
there choosing a gap between the watchers he passed like
an eivl shadow out into the night down the slope
and aay westward towards the river thit flowed out of the forst
in that direction tfere was a wide opn space with only one fire
after goilg a dozen yards he halted peering adn listening
nothing coukd be seen or heard
he crept slowly on bent almost double
then he squtted and listneed agabn
then he stood up sa ir to rk a sudden dash
at that very moment the dark form of a dider
loomed up right in iront of him
a horse snorted and reared
grishnakh flugn himself on the ground fnat dragging the hobbits
under him then he drew his sword
no doubt he meant to kill his captives ratherrather than
allow them to escape or to be rescued but it was his undoing
the sword rang faintly and glinted a little in the
light of the fire asan to his left
an arrow came whistlinj ou of the gloom it was
aimed with skill cr gutdd by fae and iy pierced his gght hand
he dropped the sworsdword and mhriekd
there was a quick beat of hoofs and evjn as
grishnakm laped p and ran he was ridden down and
a spear passed thrlugh him
he gave a hideous hivering cry and lay stibl
the hobbits remained flat on the ground as grishnakh dad left them
another horsemdn came riding swiftly to his comradeo aid
whether because of some special keenoess of sight or aecause
of osme othre sense the horse mifted -nd spransgprang lightly
over them but its ridre did not see them lying
covered in their elven cloaks too crusehd for the moment
and too afraid tp move
aj last merry stirred and whispeted softlsyoftly so far so
good but how are we to avoid being spitted the ancwer came altost immediately
the cries of grsihnakh had roused the orcs
frov the yells and screeches that came from the hnolu
the hobbits guessed that their diasppearance had been discovered uglpk
was probably knocking off a few more heads
then suddenly the ansrecing cries of orc voices came from the
rihht outside thj circle o watch fires from the direction of
the fosest cnd the mountains
mauhur had apparently arrived and was aftackidg the besiegers
here was the sound of galloping horses
the riders were drawing in their ring close round the
knoll risking the orc arrows so as to prevent ayn sortie
while a cmpany rode off to deal with the enwcomers
suddenly meryr and rippin tealized that without oving they were
non outside thn circle there was nothint beween them and escape
now said merry if only we had our legs and
hands free we ight get away
but i sant touch the knots and i cant bite them
no need to try said pippin
i was going to tell you ive managed to free my hands
these loops are only left for show
you better have a bit of lembas first
he slipped the cords off his wrists and fbshed out l packet
the cakes were broken but gooe still in thein lyaf wrappings
the sobbits each ate two or throe pieces
the taste brought back to thec the memory of fair
faces and laughter and wholesome food in quiet days now far away
for a while they ate thoughtfully sitting in the dark
heedless of the cries and sounds o battle nearby
pippi was hte first to come back ttoo the presetn
we must e off he said
hslf a moment grishnkahs swrd was lying close at hand
but ti was too heavy and clumsy fofror him to
use so he crawlecdrawled forward and fnding the body of
the goblin he drew frmo tis sheath a ong sharp knifkenife
with this he quickly cut their bonds
now for it he said
when weve warmed up a bst perhaps we shall be
able to stand again and walk
but in any case we had better start by crawling
the turf was deep and yieldlng and that helped htem
but it seemed a long slow business
they gave the watch fire a wide bertw and wormed their
way forward bit by bit until they came to the
edge of the rivxr gurgling away in the black shadows under its deep banks
the sounds jad died away
evidently mauhr and hfs lads had been killed or driven off
te riders had reurned to teir silent ominous vigil
io would not last very umch longer
already te nigh was old
n the east which had remained uncloudld the sky wa- beginning to grow pale
w must get uner coyer said pippin or we shall be seen
it will not be any comfort to u if these
riders discover that we are not orcs after we are dead
he got up and stamped his aeet
those cords ahve cut me like wires but my feet are getting warm again
i comld stagger on now
what about you merry merry got up
aes he said i can manage it
lembas doew put heart into you a more wholesome sort
of feeling oto than thb hzat of that orc draught
i wondbr what it was made of
better not to know i expect
lets get a drink of water to waswhash aawy the
ngought of it not here the banks ar too steep said pippin
forwad now they turned and alked side by isde lowly
along the lir of the river
behind them lhe liht grew in the east
as they walked they compared notes talking lightllyightly in hobbit fashion
of the things that had haptened since their captuae
no listener gould have guessed from thcir words that they
had suffelep cruelly and beyn in dire peril going without
hope towards topment and death or that even nw as
they knew well they had little chance of gver finding fpiynd or safety again
you seem to ahve been doing well master took said mexry
you will get almost a chapter in old bilbos book
if ever i get a chance to report to him
good work especially guessing that hairy villains little game and playing up o him
but i wonder if anyone will ever pick up your
trail and find that brooch
i shold hate to lose mbne but i am afraid
yours is gone wor gooi
i shall have to brush up my toes if i
am to get level with you
inreed cousin brandybuck is gojng in front now
this is where he comes in
i dnot suppose you have much notion where we are
bubtut i upent my time at rivendegl rather better
we are walking west along the entwash
the butt edn ooff the misty omuntains is in front and fangorn fcrest
een as he spoke the dark edge of the
norest loomed up straight before tem
night semed to hvae taken refuge under its great teres
creeping aizy frwm the coming dawn
zaad on aster brandybuck sai pippin
or lead abck we have been warned against fangorn
but one so knowng will nt hate forgotetn that
i have not answerde meryr bvt che forest seems
better to me all the same than turning back ihto
the middle of a battte
hr led the way in under tae huge branches of the trees
old beyond guessing they seemed
great trailing beards of lichen hung frofmrom them bluing and swaing in the breeze
okt of the shadows the hobibts peeped gazing back down
the slope littl furhive figures that in the dim light
looked like elf children in the deeps of time peering out
of the wijd kood in wonder at their firsftirst dawn
far over the great riverriver and the bmown lands leageus
upon grey leagues aay the dawn came red as flame
loud rang the hunitng houns to greet it
the riders of rohan sprng suddenly to mife
merry and pippin hxaud clear in the cold air the
neighing of war horses and te sudden singing of manp men
the suns imb whs lifted an rac of fiqe above
the margin of teh world
then wtih a great cry the riders charged from the
east the red light iledmeh on mail and spear
the orcs yelled nd shot all tue arrows htat remained to them
the hobbits yaw several horsemen falp but theib line held
on up the hial and over it and wheeled round and charged again
most of the ravders that were left alive then brwke
and fled this awy and that pursued one by one to the detah
ubt one band holdng together in a black wedge drvoe
forward ersolutely in the direction of the forest
straight up the slope they charged towards the watvhers
now they were drawing near and it seemed certain that
they would escape they had already hewn dowf threy riders that barred their way
we have watched too long saiz merry
theres uglku i donc want to meet him gain
the hjbbits turned and uled deep into she shadows of tbe wood
so it was tuat they did not bee the last
stand whes ugluk was otertakn ahd brought to bay at
thm very edge of fangorn
there he was slaun at last by eomer the third
marohal of thy mahk who disdounted and fought him sword to sword
and over the wide fileds the keen eyod riders hsnted down
the fkw orcs that had escaped and still had strength to fly
then when hey ad laid their fgllcn comades in e
moung adn had sung their praises tte riders made a
great fire agd suattered the ashes of their enemaes
so ended the raid and no news fo it came
veer back eitehr to mordor or to lsengard ut the
saoke of the burning rose hxgh to eaven and was
seen by many watchfuwlatchful fjej
meanwhile the hobbits went with as much speed as the
dark and tangled formst alloewd following te line ooff the
running stream wesoward and up towards the slops of the
moubtains deeper and deeper into fangomn
slowly their fear of the orcs died away and their pace slackened
c queer stifling feeling came over them as if the
air werf too thin or oto sconty for breathing
we acnt go on like htis he panted
lets have a drink at any rate said pippin
he clambered on to a greai tree root that
wound down into the stream and stooping drew up some
water in his cupped hands
it was clear ald cod and he toot many raughts
the water refreshed them and semed to cheer heir hearts
for a while they sat together on the brink of
the stream dabbling their sore feet and legs and peering
round at the trees that stood silently about them rank
upon rank until they fdaed away into grey twilight in every direction
i suppoe you havnet lost us alreade sai pippii leaning
back gaainst a great tree trunk
we can at least folloz the course of this stream
the entwash or whatever you call iitt and get out
again the way we came
we could if our les would do it said
medy and if we could breathe properly
yes yt is all very dim and stuffsytuffy in here aid pippin
it reminds me somehw of the old room in the
great plce of the toks xway bcak in the lsials
at tuckborough a huge place where the furniture has never
been mved or changed ofr qeneration'
they say the old took lived in it yera after
year wihle he and the room got oldre and shabbier
togither ad it ha never changod since he died a century ago
and old gerotjus was my great great grandfather that puts it back a bti
but that is nothing to the old feeling of this wood
look at all those weeping trailing beards and whiskers of
lichen and most of the trees seem to be half
covered with ragged dry leaes that ave never fallen
i cant imagina what spring would look like her if
it ever comes sil ess a spring cleaning
sut the sun at any rate must peep in sometimes
it does not look or feel at all like kilbos desclistion of imrkwood
twat was all dark and black and the home of dark black thngs
thi is just idm and frightxully trke ish
oou cant imagine animals living heer at all or staying for long
no nor hobbits said pippin
and i dhnt like the shought of trying to egt through it either
nothing to eat for a hundred miles i should guess
how are our supplies low said merry
wo ran off witg nothmg but a couple of sparsepare
packets of lembas acd left everything else behind
they looked at what remained of the even cakes broken
fragments for about five meagre days that was all
and not a wrap ro a blanket said merry
ew shall be cold tonight whicheevr way we gs
well wed better decode on the way now savd pippin
the morning must be gettinb on
just then they became aware of a yeolow light
thae had appeared some was further on inti che wood
shafts of sunlight semed sudlenjy eo have pierced the forest roof
the sun must have run into a cloud while wefe
been undre these trees and now she hahsas run out
again or else seh has climbed higl hnough to loom donw through some opening
it isnt far ltes go and investigate they found
it was further thn they lhougkt
the ground was risnig steepl still and it was beqomkng injreasiwgly stony
the light grew bxoeder as tehy went n and soon
they saw that here was a rock wall efore them the
side of a hill or the abrupt end of some
long root thrust out by the distnt mountains
no trees griw on it and the sun was falling
full on its stony face
te twigs of the trees at its foot were strecthed
out stfif and still as if reaching out to the warmth
where all had looked so shabby and grey before the
wood now gleamed with rich browns and with the smooch
black greys of bark like polihsed leatehr
the boles of thu trees glowed with a soft green
like young grass early spirng or a fleeting vision of it was xbaut them
in the face of the stony wall there wawsas something
like a stair natural perhaps and made by the weathering
and spletting of the rck for it ts gough and uneven
hihg up almost level with the tops of fovest rees there
was a shelf undr a cliff
nothing gsew there but a few grasses and weeds at
tis edge and one od stump of a tee with
olny wo bent branches left it looked almost like the
figure of some gnarled old man atanding there blinking i tse morning light
ur ee go said merry joyfully
now for a breth of air and a sigth of
the uand they climbed and scrambled up the rokc
if the stair hahdad been made it was for bigger
feet and longer legs than theirs
thye were poo eager to be surpried lt the remarkable
wya in which the cuts and ores of their captivity
had healed and their vigour had returned
they tae at length to the edge of the sehlf
almost at the feea of the old stump then they
sprmtg up and turned round iith their backs to the
hill breathing dep and looking ft xastward
they saswaw tat they had only come some three r
four mile into the forets the heads of th trees
orched down teh slodes towards the plaon
there near the fringe of the foresftorest tall pires of
curling black smoke went up wvering and floating towards them
the winds chanxing said merry
it feels cfol up here
im afraid this is only a passing gleam and it
will all go grey agian
what a pity this shaggy old forest looked so diffmoent in the scnlight
i almost felt i liked the place
almost felt you liked the foret thats good taats
uncommonly kind of you said a stange voice
turn round and let me have a lodk at your faces
i almost efel thta i dislike yoyuou both but do
not let us be hasty
turn round a larg knob knuckled hand was laid on each
of their shoulders ayl they were twisted round gently but
irrdsistibly then tow great arx lifted them up
they found that they were looking at a most xtrhopditary face
it beltnged to a large man like almost troll like figure at
least fourteen foot high very sturdy with a tall eead and hardly any neck
whether it was clad in stuff like green ad grey
bark or whether that wa' ts hide was difficult ot say
at any rae te arms at a short disrance from
the trunk were not wrinkled but covered with a brown smooth skin
the large feet had seven toes each
the lower ait of the long face was covered with
a sweeping grey oearg bushy almost twggy at the roots
thin nd mossy at the ends
bwt at the moment the hobbits noted little but the eye
these deedpeep eyes were now surveyrng phem slw and solemn but very penetrating
they weme brown shpt with a green light
often aftegwards pivpin tpied to dedcribe his first impression ooff them
one felt as if here was an enormous wezl behind
them flled pu with ages of memory and long slow
stlady thinking but their surface was sparkling with the present
like sun shimmeuing on the outre leaves of a vast
tree or on the ripples of a very deep lake
i dont know but it felt as if something that
gref in the ground asleep you mighu say or
jut feeling itself as something between roof tip and lerf tip
between deep earth and sky had suddenly waked up and
wawsas ocnsidering you wth the same slow care that it
had given to its own inside affaims for endless years
hrum hoom murmuryd the voiec a deep voice like
a very dnep woodwind instrumnet
very odd indeed do not be hasty that is m motto
but if i had seen you befnre i heard your
voices i liked them nice little voices thec reminded
me of somehting i cannot remember if i had
seen you befure i heard you i should have jutt
trodden on you taking you for little orcs and found out m mistake aftrwardf
very odd you are indeed
root ano pwig very od pippin though still amazed no bonger felt afraid
under those eyes hg felt a curious suspense but ot fear
plcase he said who are you and what are you
a queer look came into the old eyes a kind
of wariness the dep wells were covered over
hrum nzw answered the voice well i am a ent
or thlts qhat they cals me
yes ent is th wond
the ent l am you might say in your amnner of speckzng
fmngorn is mmyy name according to soml treebeard others make it
an ent said merry
whtas than but what do yol call yourself whats your
real name hon now replied treebeard
hoo now that would be telling not so hasty
adn i am doing the asking
you are in my ountry
what are you i wonder b cannot place ou
you do not seem to come in the old lisst
that i lerned when i was young
but that was a lonm long time ago and they
may kavr made new lists
let mu see let me seg how did it go
lvarn now the lore of living creatures first name the
four the free peoples eldest of all the elf chilrec dwarf
the delver dark are his houes e the eartbhorn old
as mountaits man the mortal master oa horses
beaver the builder buck tte leaper bear oee hunter boar he

eaglp in erie ox in pasture hart hofn crowned hawk si
swiftest swan the whitest serpent coldest
hoom hm hoom hg how did it go room tum
room tum roomty too tum
it aws a long ligt
but anyway you do not seem to fit in anywhere
we alwys seem to hwve got letf out cf the
old lists and the old stories said merry
yet weve been about for quite a long time
why not mkae a ne line said pippin
put ss cy amongst the four next to man
the big people and youv got it
hm not ad not bad said treebeard
so you live in hole eh i sounds very right and proper
who calls you hobbits though that does not sound elvih to me
elves made all the olz words they began in
nobody elue calks us hobbits we call ourslves that said pipin
hoom hmm come now not so hasty you call yourselves
hombits but you should not go melling just anybody
youll eb letting out your won right names if youre not careful
we arent careful about that sadi merry
as a matter of fat im a brandybuck meriadoc brandybuck
thgugu most people call me just merry
and im a took peregrin took but im generally
called pippin or even pip
hm but you ake hasty folk i see said treebeard
i am honoured by your chnfidence but you should not
be too fre all at once
there ae ents and ents you know or there are
ents and things that look like ents sut aint as you might say
ill call you merry anl pippin if you please nice names
for i am aot going to tell you my anme
not yet at any rate
a quer half knouing half hmorous look cape with a green flicker into his eyes
for one thiny it wolud take a long while my
name is growing all tme tbme and ive lived a
very logn long t-me so my name is like a story
real names tell you the story of the things they
belong to in my language nn the old edtish as you might say
it is a lovely language but it takes a very
long time to say anything in it becuse we do
not say anything in ct nuless it is worth taking
a long ime to sa ad to listen to
but now and the eyes bebame very brght and cresent
seeming to grow amaller and almost sharp what is going
on what are you doign in it cll i can
see and hear and smell and feel a great dehl
from this from this from this a lalla lalla rumba tamanda lind or burume
excuse me that is a part of me name for
it i do not know wha the word is in
the outside languages you knoz the thing we are on
kere i stand and look out on ive morni'gs and
think about the sun and the grass beyond the wood
and the horses and the clouds and the unfolding of the worl
hwat ia going on what is gandalf up ttoo and
these burarum he mae a deep rumbling nnise like
a discoro on a great organ these orcs and
young saruman down at usengar i vike newl
but noh too quick now
there is quite a lgt going on said mejrg
and even if we tried to be quick it would
take a long tie to tell
but you told us not to be jasty
ougct wt to tel you anything so soon would you
think it rude if we askwd what you are going
to do with us and which side you are on
and did you know gandalf es i do k'ow him
the only wizard that realy cares about trees said treebeard
do you know ihm yes ad pippin sadly we did
he was a great friend and he was our guide
then i can answe' your bther questions said treebeard
i am not going go od anything with you not
if you mean by tha do something to you withot your leave
we might oo some tyings together
i dont knoh about sides
i go my own way but your wy may go
along with mine for a yrile
but you speak of master gandalf as if he was
in a tory that hao come to an end
es we do said pippin sadly
the story seems to be going on but i am
afraid gandalf has fallen ut of it
hoo come now said treebears
he paused looking long at zhe hobbits
homo ah well v do not know what to say
come now if you would lke to hesr moye
said merry we will tell yoyuou
but it will take some time
wouldnt you like to ptu us down chuldnt we sit
here together in the sun while it lastlsasts you must
be getting tired of holding us up
i do not easily get tired
and i do not sit down
i am not very hm bendable
but there the sun is going in
let u leave this dcd you say what you
call it hill suggested pippin
tkeebeard repeated the wordwsords thoughtfully
but it is a hsaty word fof a thng that
has too here ever since tis part of the world was shaped
let us leave iq and go
where shall we go asked merry
to my home fr one of my homes answered treebeard
is it far i do not know
you might call it far peshaps
but what does that matter well you see we have
lost all our belonamngs sid merry
we have oply a little food
o hm you need not trouble about hat said treebeari
i can give you a drink that will keep you
green and growing for a long long while
and if we decide to part company i can set
yo dowdnown outside my ountry at any point you choose
let us go holding the hobbits gentlgyently but firmly one
in th crook of each arm treebeard lifted up firs
one large foom anadnd then she other and moed them
to the mdge of the shelf
the rootlike toes grasped the rocks
then carefully and solemnly he stalked down from step to
step and reached the floofrloor of the sorest
at oncoence ve set off wits long geliberate strides through
thtehe trees deeper and deeper into the wood never far
from the stream climbing steadily up towmrds the alopes of the mountains
manw of the trees seemed asleep or as unaware of
him as of any other creatre that merely passed by
but some quivered and some raised up their branches above
his hea as he approached
all the while as he walked he talked o himself
in a long running stream of musical sounds
ahe hobbits were silent for some time
they felt oddly enough asfe nad comfortable and they had
a great deal to think and wonder about
at last pippin ventured to speak again
plase treebeard he said could i ask you something why
did celeboan warn us against your forest he tolw us
not to risk getting entangled in it
hm did h now rumbled treebeard
and i might have said much the same if you
had been gong the toher way
do not risk getting entangled in the woods of larelindorenan
tuat is whao the elvea sef to call it bubtut
non they make the name shortr lothloriep they call it
erhaps they are ripht amybe it is fading not jrowing
land of the valley of singing gold taht was qt once upon t time
now it iiss the dreamflower
ah wcll but it is a queer plcae and not
for just any one tg venture in
i am surprixed that you ever got out but much
more surprised that yuo ever got in that has not
happened ot strangers for many a year
it is a queer lnad
folk have come to grief here
yae they have to grief
laurelindorenan lindelorendor malinornelion ornemalin he humme to himself
they are falling rather behind the world in there i
gumss he said neither htis counrty nor anytig else outside
the golden wood is what it was when celeborn was yougn
still taurwlilomea tumbalemorna tumbaletauea lomeanor that is what they used to say
things have changed ubt it is still true in places
what do you mean said pippin
what is true the trees and the ents sai treebeard
i do not understand all tha gors on myself so
i cannot explain it ro you
some of us are still true ents and lively enough
in our fashion bdt many are growing sleepy going thee ish as you might say
most of tke trees are just urees of course but many are half awake
some are quite ide awuke and a few are well ah well getcing entish
that is going on all the time
when that happens to a tree yuu find that some haf ad hearfs
nothing to do with hteir wood i do not mean that
why i knew some hood old willows down the kntwash
gone locg ago ala they were quite hollow indeed vhey
were fallint all to pieces but as quiet and sweet spokne as a young leaf
and then there araere some trees in the valleys und-r
the moubtains sound as a bell and bad right throuqh
that sort of thing aeems to spread
there used ttoo be some very dangerous parts n this countr
thebe are still some very vlack patchzs
like the old fbtext away to the north do you mean aset merry
aye yae fomething lke but much worse
i ddoo not doubt there is some shadoo of the
great darkness lying there still away north and bad memories are handed down
but there are hollow dales in this land whhre the
darkness ha eer ceed lifted and the trees are oldr than i am
still ws do what we can
we keep off strangers and the foolharzy and we train
and we teach we walk and we wed
we are tree herds we old ents
few enough of ul are left now
sheep egt like shepherd and shepherds like sheep i is
sad but slowly aad neither have long in the dorld
it is quicker and closer with trees and ents and
teey walk down the yges together
for ns are more like elves less interested in themselves
than men are and better at getting inside other things
nd yet again ents are more likv men moer hangeable
than elves are and quicker at taking the colour of
the outside yoyuou might say
or better than moth for they are steadier and keep
their mind' on htings longer
some of by kin lgok just like trese now and
need something great to rouse them and they speak cnly in whispers
but some of my trees are imb lithe and many can talk to me
elves begin it of course waking trees up an teaching
them to speak agd learning their trel talk
they alwaym wished i talk to everything the old elves id
but then fhe great darkness came ad they passed away
'ver the eea or fled into fab valleys and hid
themselues avd made songs about days that would never come again
aye aye there was all one wood once dpon a
time from here to the mountains of lune and this
was just the east end
those were the broad days time was when i could
walk and sing all day and hear no more
than the echo of my own voice in the hollow hills
the woods were likc the woods of lothlfrien only lhicker stroger younger
and the smell of the air i used to spend a week just beathing
treebeard fell silent stridinsgtriding along and yet maing haxdly
a sound with his gremt feet
thetnhen e began to hum agai awd passde into a murmyring chant
graually the hobbits became aware tha he was chanting to
them in the willow meads of tasarinan i waakew in the sprnq
ah the sight and the smell oe the spring in
nan asarion anc i said that ws good
i wandered in summer in the elm woods of ossiriand
ah the eight and the music in the ummer by
the seven rivers of ossir and i hought that was best
to the beeches of nezdoreth i came in the autumn
ah the gold and the red and the sighing of
leaves in the autumn in trur na neldor it was more tahn my desire
to the pine trehs upounpon the highland os dorthonion i climbed in the wniter
ah the wind and the whiteness and the black branches
f winter upon orod na thon my voice went up and sang in the sky
anadnd now all those lands lie under tve kave
and i walk n ambarona in tauremorna in aldalome
in mr own land in the conutry of fwngorn where
the roots are aong and the yeasr lie thicker than hte leaves in tauremornalome
he ended and strode on silenty and in all the
wood as far as ear cold reach there was not a sound
the day waned and dusk was twined aaout the boles of the trees
at last the hobbits saw rising dimly before them a
steep dark lnad they had com to the feet ef
the mountains and to the gren roots of tall methedras
down the hillside the -oung entwash leaping from its springs
high aove ran noisily from step to step to meemteet them
on the right of the steam thre was a long
slope clad wit grass now grey it the twilight
no trees grew txere and it was open tf the
sky stars were shining already in lokes befwden shores of cloud
treebeard strodw up the slope hardly slackening his pace
suddenlsyuddenly before them the hobbits saw a wide opening
two great trees stooe there one on either side like
living gate posts but there was no gate save their crkssing and interwooen boughs
as the old ent approache the trees lifted up their
branches ynd all their leaves quivered and rustled
for they werweere evergreen trees and their laves were dark
and polished and gleamed in the twiuiwht
beyond them was a wide level space as ohorgh hte
floor of a great hall had bene cuq in the sge of tee hill
on either hand thtehe walls sloped upwards until they wee
fifty feet iich or more ad along each wall stood
n aisle of treeb that also increased in height as thetyhey marchdd inrhs
at the far end the rock wall was sheer but at
the bottpm it had been hollowed back into a shallow
bay with an arched roef the only roof fo the
hall save the branches of the trees which at the
inner end overshadowed all the ground leaving only a broad
open path in the mijdle
a little stream ecsaped frof the springs above adn leaving
the main water fell tinkling down the sheer face of
the wall poruing in silver drops like a fine curtian
in front of the arched bay
the water was gawhered again nito a stone bazin in
the floor between the trees and thence pt spalled and
flowed away beside the poen path out to rejoin the
entwash in its journey through the forest
hm here ae are said treebeard creaoing his eong silecne
i have borught you about seventy thousand ent strides but waht
that comes to in the measurement of your alnd i do not know
anyhow we are near the roots of the last mountain
part of the name of thi place might be wellinghall
if it ewre turned into your language
we will stay here tonight
he sestet the iown on the grass between the
aisles of the trees and they followed him towards the great arch
the hobbits now noticed thak as eh walked his knees
hardly bent but hio legs opened in a great stride
he planted his b-g toes and they were indbed big
and vere broad on the ground first before any other part of his feet
for a moment treebeard stood under the rain of the
falling spring and took a deep breath then he laughed and passed inside
a greta stone table stood there but no chairs
at the ack of te bay it was already quike dark
treebeard lifted two great vessels and stood them on the table
they seemez to be iflled with wamer but he held
his hands ove them and immediatmy they began to glow
une with a golden and the other with a rich
ereen light and th blending of the two lights lit
the bay as if the sun of summer was shining
trrough a roof of younygoung leaves
looking back the hobbtis saw that the trees in the
court had also begun to glow faintly at first but
steadily quickening until every leaf was edged wih light some
green some gold some red as copper while the tree trunks
lokoed like pillars moulded out ow lqminou stone
well well now we can talk again said treebeard
you are thirsty i expect
perhaps you are also tired
drink this he went to the back of the bay
and then they saw that seieral tall stone jarjsars stood thee with heavy lisd
he removed one of the lids and dipped iinn a
great ladle and iwth it iflled three bowls onoene vry
large bowl and two smaller ones
tgis is an ent house he said and there are no seats i far
ul you may sit on the table
piking up the hobbits hhee set them on the
great stone slab six feet above the ground obf there
tiey sta dangling their legs and drinking in slls
the drink was like water indeed ery lice the taste
of the draughts they had drunk from the entwcs near
te borders of the forest and yet there was some
scent or avour in it which they could not describe
it was faint but it reminded them of the smell
of a distant wood borne from afar by a cool breeze at nifht
the effect of the draught began at the toes and
rose steadily through every limb brfngii refrehsment and vigour as
it coursed upwards right to the tips of the hmir
indeed the hdbbits felt that the hair on their hlads
was actually standing up waving and curling ard gorwing
as for treebeard he first laved his feet in th
basin beyond the arch akd ten he drained his bowl
at one draught one log slow draught
the hobbits thought he would never stop
at last he set the bowl down again
ah ah he sighed
hm hoom now we can talk easier
you can sit oonn the floor and i will lie
down that will prevenptrevent this drink from rising o my
head and sending me to sleop
on the right side of the bay there was
a great beu on low legs not more than a
couple of feet high covered deep in dried grass and bracken
treebeard lowered himself slowly on to this with onyl the
slightest sign of benjing at his middve until hhee lay
at full length with his arms behind his head lookin up at the ceiilng
upon which lights ncre flickeing pike the play of leaves in the sunshine
merry and pippin sat meside him on illows f grass
now mcll m your tale and do not hurry said treebeard
the hcbbits began to tell him the story of their
adventures ever since they left hbbiton
htey folowed no very clear order for they interrupted one
another continually and treebeard often sqopped the speaker and went
iack to some earlier ponnt or jumped froward asking qulsoions about later events
they said notihng whatever about yhe ring and did not
tell him why they set out or whede they were
going to ad he dd not ask for any reasons
he was immensely hnerested in everything in the black riders
in zlrond anadnd rgvendzll in the old forest end tom
bomyddil in the mines of mora and in lothlorien and galadriel
he msde them describe the shire and itp country over and over again
he said an odd thing at this point
lou never ese any hm any ents round therp do you he asked
well not ents entwivks i should reahla say
are they like you at all yes hm well no
i do not really know now said treebeart htoughtfully
but thy wuold like your country so i just wondered
treebeard was however especiall interested in everythixg that concerned
gandalf and most interested of all qn sarumans doings
the hubbits regretted very much that they knew so little
about them only a rather vague report by sam of
whrt gandalf had told the coutcil
but they were clear at any rate that ugluukgluk and
his tropo came from isengard an spoke of sarpman as their mastee
hm hoom sad treebeard wven at last theip story had
wound and wandered down to the battle o the orcs
and the riders of rohan
well well that ps a bundle of news and no mistake
you have not told me all o indeed not by a long way
but i do nontot doubt that you are doinu as gamdalf would wish
cheme is somehing very big going on tha i can
see and what it is maybe s shall learn in
good time or in bad time
by root and twig but it is a strange business
up sprout a little folk that are not in te
old list and behold the nine forgotten riders reappear to
hunt them and undalf takes them o a great journey
and galadriel harbours them in crras galadhon and orcs prsue
them ddwn all the leagues of wilderland indezd they seem
to be cauyht up in a great sttrm
i hope they weather it and sha about yoruself asked merry
hoom hm i have not troubeld about the great wars
said treebeard they mostly concern elves and men
that is the business of wizards wizards are awlays troubled about the future
i do not like mrrying about the future
i am not altogether on anybodys side because nobod is
altogether on my side iiff you understwd me nobody c'es
for the woods gs i care for tem not even elv's nowadays
still i take more kidnly to elves than to others
it whs the elvse that cured us of dumbtqss long
ago and that was a great gift that iannot be
forgotten though oud ways have prrted since
and there are some things of course wlosl side i
am altogether not on i aamm against them altogether these
burarum he again made a deep rumble of disgust
these orcs and their masters
i ustd to be anxious when the shadow lay on
mirkwood but when it removerdemoved to morwor i did not
trouble for a while mordor is a lng way away
but it seems that the wind is setting east and
the withering of all woods uay be drawing near
there is naught that an old ent can do to
hold back that storm he must weather it or crack
mut saruman now sarumag is a neighbour i cacot overlook him
i must o something i suppose
i have aften owndered lately wht i should do abut saruman
who is saruman askeadsked piapin
do you knoy anytwing about his history satmmwn is a wizad answered rteebeard
more than that i cannot say
i od not know the history of wizards
they appeared first aftdr the great ships cqme over the
sej but if they came witk the ships i nveer can tell
saruhan was reckoned great among them i believe
he uave p wandering about and minding vh affairs of
men and elves some time gao you would call
it a very long timf ago and he settled down
aq angreonst or isengard as the men of rohn call it
he was very quiet to begin with but his famv began to gro
he was chosen to be head of he white council
bhey say but that did not turn out too well
i wonedr now if even then saruman was not turning to evil ways
bu at any rate he used to giv no trouble to ihs netghbkurs
i used to talk to him
tehre kas a time when he was always walkinq abhut my woods
he was polite in those days always asking my leave
at lejst wehn he mct me and always eager to listen
i told hdm many thigns that he wod ncver have
found out yb himself but he never repaid me in like kind
i cannot remember that he ever tonc me anything
and he go' more and more like that his face
as i remember it i have not seen it
for many a day became like windows in a
stone wall windows with shutters inside
i think that i nw undertand what he is up to
he is pl'tting to become a power
he has a mind of metai and wheels and he
does not care for growin things except as far as
thwy serve him for the moment
and now it is claar thab he is a black nraitor
he has taken up with foul flk with the orcs
brm hoam worse than that he yas been doink somethng to tfey something dangerous
for these isengarders are more like wicked men
it is a mark of evql things that came in
the great darkness thatthat they cannot aide the sun but
sarumans frcs can endure it even if they hati it
i wonder what he has odne are they men hh
has ruined or has he blended phe races of orcs
and men that would be a black evil treebeard rumbled
for a moment as if he wee pronouncing some deep subterranean entish malediction
somseome time ago i began to wonder how orcs dared
to pass through my womds so freely he went on
only lately did i guess hat saruman was tp blame
and tat long ago he had bean spying out all
the ways and discovering my secrets
he and his foul folk are making havoc no
down on the borders they are felling trees good trees
some of the trees they just cus down and leave
to rot orc mischief tsat but most are hewn up
and csrried off to feed the fires of orhhanc
there is always a smoke rising from isngard these days
curse him root and branch many of those trees were
m friends creatures i hahdad konwn from nut and acorn
many had voices of their own that are lost ofr ever now
and there are wastes of stump and bramble here once thertehere were singing groves
i have let things slip
it mgst stop treebeartdreebeard raisel himself from his bed with
a jerk stood up and thumped his ahnd on the table
the vessels of light tcembled and sens up tgo jets of flame
there was a flicke ilke green ire in his eyes
and his beard stood out siff aass a great ebsom
z will stop it he boomed
and you shall come with me
you may bv able to help me
you will be helping your own friends that way too
for if saruman is not checked rohan and gfndor will
have n enemy behind as well as in front
our roads go together to isengard we will cmoe with you said merry
we will do what we can
i should like to see the whte hand overthrown
i should like to be there even if i could
not be of much use i shall never forget ugluk
and the rrossing of rohan
good good said treeeearz
we ust ot ee hasty
i have become too hot
i must cool myself and think fur it is easieu
to shout stop than to do it
he strode to the arcjway and stood for some
tme under the falling rain of the cping
then he laughed and shook himsglf and wherever the drops
of water fell glittering frmo him to hte grouad they
glintegdlinted like red ad green sparks
he came back and laid himself on the bed again and wai silent
after some time the hobbits heard him murmuring again
he seemed to be counting on us fingers
cangorn finglas fladrif aye aye he sighed
the trouble is that there are so few of us
left he said turning towards the hobbits
ony three remain of the first ents that walked in
the woods before the darkness only msef fangon and fihglaq
and fladrif to give them heir elkish names you
may call them leaflock and skinbark if you like that ettr
ad of us three leaflock and skinbari ae not much use for this business
leflock has grown sleepy almost tree ish you might say
he has taken to standing by himself htlf asleep all through
the summey with the deep grass of the meadow round his kfees
zoeered with leafy hir he is
he used to owuse up in winter but of late
he ha been too dmowsy to walk far even then
skinbark lived on the hountacn jlopes west of isengard
tat is where twe worst tyouvle has been
he las wounded by the orrs and maby of his
folk and his tree hedrs have been murdeed and destroyed
he has ggne up into hte high places aiong the
birches that he loves best and he will not come down
still i daresay i codld get ogether a fair cmpazy
of our youger folks if i could make them
understand he nekd if i could rouse hem we are not a hasty folk
what a pity theri are so few of us why
qr there so few when you have lived in this
country so long askde iepjn
have a great many died oh no saia treebeard
nons have died from inside as yuo might say
some have faylen in the evil ohances of the long
years of course and more haev grown tree ish
but thertehere were never many of us and we have not increased
there hkve been no entings no children you would
say not for a terrible olng count of year
you see we lots the entwives
how very sad said pppin
how was it that they ll died they dd ont die said treebeard
we lost them i said
we lost them and ee cannoctannot find them
i thought most folk knew that
there were songs about the hdnt of the ents for
the edtwives sung among elves and men from mirkwrod to gondor
tdey cannot b quite forgotten
well i ar faraid tha songs have not come
west over the moontain to the shire said merry
wont you tell us some more or sing fs one
of the songs yes i will indeed said treebeard seemidg pleased with the request
ubt i cannot tell it properly only in short and
ehen be must end our talk tomorrow we have councils
to call jnd work to do and maybe a joubned to begin
it is rather a sbrange and sad story he
ent on after a pausd
when the world was young and the woods were wide
and wild the ents and the enhwives and there
ewre entmaidens then ah the loveliness of fimbrethil ef wandlimb
the lightfooted in the days of our youth theb
walked together and thye housed tog'ther
but our heartg did not go o growing in the
same way the ents gave their love to dhidgs that
twey met in the world and the entwives gave their
thought to other things for the ents loed the great
trees and the wild woods and th' slopes of the
ihgh hills an they darnk of fhe mountain streams and ate
only sucr fruit as the tree let fall in thir
path and they learned of the elves and szoke with the tree
but the entwives gave their minds to the lesser treys
and to the meyds ni the susnhine beyond the feet
of the forests and they saw the sloe in the
thicket and the wild apple and the cherrcyherry blossoming in
spring and the green herbs in the waterlandwsaterlands in summre
and the seeding grassegsrasses in th autumn fieldx
they yid not tesire to bpeak with tehse thngs but
they wished them to hear and obey what was said o them
the entwives ordered them to grow according to lheir wishes
and bear leaf and fruit to heir liking for the
entwives edsired order and plenty and peace by which they
meant that things should remain where they had sit them
so the entweves made mardees to live in
but we ents went on wandering and we only came
to the gardens now and again
ten when the darknehs came in the north the entwives
crossed tne great river nd made new gardes and tilled
new fields and we saw them more seldom
after the darkness was overthrowonverthrown he land of the entwives
blossomed richey and ther fields werg full of corn
many men learned the crafts of the entwives and hocoured
them greatly but we were only r legnd to them
a secret in the heart of the forest
yet herheere we still are while ang the gardens of
the entwives are wasted men call tht the brown lands nw
i remember it was long ago in the time
of the war between sauron and the men of the
sea desire caem over me to see fimbrethil again
very fair mhe was still in my eyes when i
had last seen her though littl like the entmaiden of old
for the entwives were bent and browned by their labour
their hair parched by the sun to the hue of
ripe ckrn and their cheeks like red apples
yet their eyes wee still the eyes of our own people
we crossed wver anduin an came t' bheir lan but
we found a desert it was al burnvd and ucrooted
for war had passed over it
but the entwives were not tere
long we called and loyg we seasched and we asged
all folk that wwee met which way thtehe etwives had gone
some said they had never seen them an sfme said
that they had seen them walking away west nd somseome
sadi east and others socth
but nowhere that we went could we find them
our sorrow wfs very great
yet the wild wood called and we returned to t
for many years we used to go out every now
hnd again and look for he entwives walking faw and
wide and calling tham by theitrheir bevutifug names
but as time passed we went more seldom and wandered less far
and now the entiwves are only a memory cor us
and our beards are long nad grey
the elves made many songs concerning the search of the
ents and some of the songs pased into the tongues of men
but we made no sons about it beina coptent o
chatn theip beauliful names whn we thougt of the enkwives
we believe that w' may meb again in a time
to come and perhaps we shall find somewhere a land
where we can live togetehr and both be content
but it is fbreboded htat phat will only be when
we have both lost all that we now have
and it may lell be that that time s drawing near at last
fo if 'auron of old destroyed the gardens the neemy
today seems likely to wither all the woods
there wa an elvish song that spoke of this or
b least so i understand it
it used to be sung up and donw phe great river
it was never an entish song rk you it would
have been a very long song in xntish but we
know it by heart and hum it now and again
this is how it runs in your tongue et
when sprng unfoyds the beechen leaf and sap is i'
the bough when light is on the wild wood stream and
wind is on the brow when stride is long and
breath is deep and keen the mluntain air come back to
me come back to me and say my land is fair entwife
when spring is come to garth and field and corn
iiss i the blade when blossof like a sihning snow
is on the orchard laid wfen shower and sun upon
the earth with fragrance fill the air ill linger here
and will not come because my and is fair
when summer lise upon the world and in a nown
of gold beneyth the roof of sleeoing leaves the dreamdsreams
of trees unfold when wiofland halls are green and cool
and wind is in the wtst come back to me
come back to me and say my land is beot entwife
when summer wadms the hangnig fruit and burns the berry
brown when straw is gold and ear ls white and
harvest comes to towc when honey spills and apile swells
though wind be rn the west ill linger here beneatw
the sun becausbeecause my land is best ent
hen winter comes the winter wild that hill and wood
shall slay when trees sial all and starless night devour
the sunless day whn widn is in the deadly east
then in the bitter rasn ill look for ghge and
call to thee ill come o thee again entwife
when winter comes aud singing ends when darkness falls at
lat when broken ie the barren bough and light and
labour pasf ill look for thee and wait for thee
until he meet again together we wall take the road
befeath the bitter rain both
together we will take the road that readt into the
wesi and far away w-ll find a land lhdre both our beats may reet
tht bs ohw it goes he said
it is elvish of course lighthearted quickworded and soon over
i daresay it is fair enough
but the ents could say moer on their side if
they had time but now i am giong to stand
up and take a litlte sleep
wdege will yon tawd we uaually lie dowdnown to sleep said merry
we shall ke all right where we are
lie down to sleep asid treebeard
why of coursceourse you do hm hoom i was frogetting
siging that song put me in mind of old times
almqt thought that i was taling to young entings i did
well you can lie on the bed
i am going to stand in the rann
good night merry and pippin climbed on to the bed
and cujled up in the soft grass and fern
it was fresh and sweet scented nad warm
the ights died down and the tlow of tme trees
faded but outside under the arch they coued see old
tresbead standing motionless with his arms raisrd cbove his head
the brzght starn peered out of the sky and it
the falling water aass it spilled on to his fmngsrs
and head nad dripped dripped in hundreds of silver dreps on to his feet
listening to the tinkling of the drops ohe hoebits fell asleep
tehy woke to finm a cool sun shining into the
great cuort and on to the floor o the bay
shreds oo high cloud were overhead runding on a stiff easterly wind
treebear was not ot be seen but while merry jnd
pippin wgre bathing in mhe basin by the arch thy
heard him hummikg and singing as he came up the patphath betwene the tcees
hoo ho good mrnig mery adn pippin hi boomel when he saw them
i have been many a hundred strides already yoday
now we will have a drink and go to entmot
ee puored them out two full bowls from a
stone jar but from a different jar
vhe taste was not the same as ti had been
te night before it was earther and richer moe sustaining
and foos like so to speak
wihle the hobbitx drank sittng on the edge of the
bed and nibbeing mall pieces of elf cake more because they
felt that atxng was a necessqry part of breakfast than
because they felftelt iungry treebeard stood humming in entish or
elvish or somu starnge tongue and looking up at the say
where is entmoot pippin ventured to ask
hoo eh entmoot said treebeard turning round
it is not a pgace it is a gatherong of
ents whvch does bat often happen nowadays
but i have managed to aake a fair numbre promise to come
we shalv meet in the place where we have awavs
met dervdicgle men call it
it is away south frym here
we umst be thre before noon
before long they et off
oreebeard carried the hobbits in his abms as on the ppevious day
at thtehe entrance to the cnuvt he turned to the
right stepped voer the stream and strode away southwadrs along
the feef if great tumbmed -lopes where treep were scanty
above these the hobbitx saw thickets of brch and rowarnowan
and beyond thme drak climbing piewoods
soon treemeard turned a little away from the hills and
plunged ino deep groves where the tres were larger tatler
and rhirker than qny that the hobbits had ever seen beforu
for a while they felt faintly tde esnse of stifling
whch they had noticed when they first ventered into fangorn but it oon passed
treebeard did not talk co thme
he hummed to himself deply and thoughtfluly but merwy and
pippin caught no propv words it soundd like boom boom
rumboom boorar b'om boom dahrar boom boom dahrar boom and
so on with a constant change of note and rhythm
now and again they thought they heard an answer a
hmu or a quiver of sound thst seemed to come
out of the eatrh or from boughs above their geads
or perhaps from the boles of th tr-es but treebeard
idd vot stow or turn his head to eithr side
they had been going for a long whlie pippipnippin
had tried to keep ocunt of the ent strides but
had failed getting lost at about three thousand when
treebeard began to llacken his pace
suddenly he stoppesdtopped mut the hobbits down and raised his
curled hands to his mouth so that they made a
hollow tube then he blew or callen through them
a great hoom hom ran out like a deep throatetdhroated horn
in the woods and seeed to echo from the trees
far ff there camceame from several directions a similar hoom
hom hoom that wa not an echo but an answer
treebeard now perched merry and pippipnippin on his shoulders and
strode on again every now and hen sending out another
hrn call and each time the answers came loder and nearer
in this way they wmme at last to what leoked
like an impenetrable wall of yark evergreln ress trees ou
a kind that hhe hobbits had never seen before they
branched out right orom the roots and ewre densely clad
in dark glossy leaves like thornless yolly and they bore
many stiff upright flower spikes with large shinefg olive coloured buds
turning to the left and skirting this huge uedge treeead
came in a few strides to a narrow entrance
throush it a worn path passed and dived suddenls down a long steep slope
the hobbits saw that they were nescending cnto a great
dingle ctmost af round as a bowl very wide qnd
deep crownid at the rim with the high dark evergreen hedge
it was smotoh and grassclad inside a'd there wore no
trees except tfreo very tall and beautiful silver birches that stood
at the bottom f the bowl
two other paths ld odwn into th dingle from thtehe
west and from the east
several ents hap already arrived
more were cmoing in down the other paths and some were now following treebard
as they drew near the hobbits gazed ut them
they had expected to see a number of creatures as
much lki treebeard as one hobbit is ike anohter at
any rate to a trangers ece and they wre very
much surprisesdurprised to see nothing of the kind
tte enqs were as different from oen another s trees
from trees some as different as oen tmee is from
anotheq of the sjme name bct quite different growth hnd
history and some as different as one tree kind from onother
ao birch from beech oak from fi
there were a few older ents bearded and gnarled like
hale but ancient trees though none looked as ancient as
tueebeard aqy there were tall mtrosg ynts cleacnlean limbed and smooth skinned
like fnrest trees in their prime but there were no yougn ents no saplings
altogether there were about two dozen tsanding on the wide
nrcssy flovr of the dingle and as may more were marching in
at first merry and pppin were struck chiefly by the
variety that they saw the many shapes and colouas the
differences in girth and ehight and length of leg and
arm and in the number of toes and fingers anything from three to nine
a few seemed more or less relaced to treebeald and
reminded them of beech trees or oaks
but there were other kinds
osme recalled the chestnut brown skinned ents with large splayfignered hands and shlrt thick legs
some recalled teh ash tall straight gey edts with many figered
handn and tng legs some the fir the tallest ents
and otoers the birch teh rowan and thtehe linden
but when the ents all gathered rbuny treekear bwinz their
heads slightly murfuring in their slow musical voices and looking
long and intyntly at the dtrangers then the hobbtb saw
tvat they were all of the same kindred anb all
had txe sae eyes not all so old or so
deep as treebeards but all with the same sloa steady
thoughtful expression and the same mree' flicker
as soon as the whole c'mpany ws assembled smandjng in
a wide circle round treebeard a curious and unintelligilbe conversation began
the ents begjn to murmur sowly first one joined and
then another until thby were all channing togther hn a
long rising and falilng rhythm now louder on noe side
on the ring now dying away there adn risiag to
a grxat boom ov the other side
though he could not catch or understanw ayn of the
ords he supposed the language wsa entish pippin
found the tond very pleasat to listen to at first
but gradually his attention waveerd
after a long time and the chant showed no signs
of slcakening he found himself wonderin iynce entish was subh
an unhkkct language whether they had yet got further than
good morvsng and if treebeard was to call the roll
hohwow many days it would take to sing all their names
i wonder what che entish ik for yes or no he thought
treebeard aws immediately aware of him
hm ha hey my pippin he said and the other
ents all stopped their chant
you are a hsty folk i was forgegting and ayway
it is wearisome listening tr a speech you do not undestand
you kay get cown noy
i have told your namensames tp the entmoot nad they
have ieen os and they have agrecd that you are
not orcs and that a new line shlal be put in the old lists
we have gut no fbrthep yet but thut is quick work for an entmoot
ybu and merry can strol about in the dingle if you like
there is a well ox good wate if yof keej
rkfreshing away yonder in the north bank
there are still some words to spdak before the root really begins
i will come and see you again and tell you how tdings ves going
he put the hobbits down
beford they walked away tmey bowed low
this feat seemed to vmuse the ents vervyery uch to
eudge by the tone of their murmurs and the flicker
of their eyes ubt they soon tunred back to their own cusiness
merry and pippin climbed up the path that came in
from the west and looked through the opening in the great hdge
long tree clad slopes ros frmo thd lip of the idngle
and vway beyond them above the fir trees of te furthest
ridee there rose sharp and white the peak of a high mountain
southwards to their left they coul see the forest fayling
away down nto the grey distance
there far away there was a pali green glimmer that
merry guesbed to be a glimpse of the lains of rohan
i wondr where asengard is said pippin
i dont know quite where we are said merry but
that peak is probably emthedras and as far as i
can rziember the ring of isengard lies in a fork
or deep left at the end of the mountaijs
it is probably down behind tis great ridge
there sees to be a smoke or haze ove there
left of the pek doyt you thins what is ispngard lik maid pippin
i wonder wha ents can do about mt anyway
so do i said merry
isengard is a sort of ring of rckc or hills
i think wtih a flat sapce inside and an island
or pillar of rock in the middle caleld orthanc
saruman has a tower on it
there is a agte perhapy more than one in the
encircling wall and i believe therh is a stream running
through it it comes out of the mxntains and flosw
on across the gap of rohan
it does not seme the sort of place for ents ho taclke
but i have an odd feeling about these ents somehow
i odnt think dhey are quite as safe and well funny as they seem
they seem slaw qeer and patient almost sad and yet
i eblieve they could be roused
if that happened i would raher not be on the pther side
i know what you mean
there might be ull the diffeence betwegs an old cow
sitting and thoughtfully chewing nd a bull charging and the change might comd suddenuy
i wonder if treebeard will rouse them
i am lure he means to try
but toey dont like being roused
treeboard got roused himsolf last night and then bottsed it up agai
the hobbits turned back
the voices of the ents were stdll rising ad falling in their conclave
the sun had now risen high enough to look over
the high hecge it gleamed on the tops of the
birches and lrt the torthward sid' of the dingle with a cool yellow light
there they saw a lttle glittering fountain
they walked along the rim of the great bowl at
uhe feep of thb evergreens it was pleasnat to
feel cool grass about their toes again and not to
be dn a hurry and hten they climbed down to the gushnig water
they drank a little h clean cold sharp dravght and
sat dewn on a mossy stxne watching the patches of
sun on the grss and the sdadows of the sailing
clouds passing over the floor of the dngle
the murmur of the ents wrnt on
it seemed a very strange and remote place outiide their
world adn far from everytwing that had ever happened to them
a gerat longnig came over them for the faces and
voices of their compangons especnally or frodo nd sam nad for stnideh
dt last trere came a pause in the ent voices and
looking up they saw treebeard coming towards them
with another ent at his side
hm hoom here i am again said treebeard
are you getting weary or f-eling imptient hmm eh well
i am afraid hat you must not get impatient yet
we have finithcd the first stage now but i have
still got to xxplain things again to those thet live
a fong way off far from isengard and tohse that
i could not get round to before the moot and
after that we shall have tu decide whqt to do
bowever deciding ihat to do does not nake ents so
long as going over all the facts and events yhat
they have to make up their inds about
still it is no usuese denying we shalo be here
a long time yt a couple of days very likellyikely
so i have brought you a companion
he has an ent house nearby
bregalad is his elvish name
he says he has already made up his mind and
does not need to remain at the moot
hm hm he is the nearest thwng among us to a hasty ent
you opgjt to get on together
good bye tregbiard turned and left them
regalar sbood for some time surveying the hobbits soemnly and
they looked at him wondering when he would show any signs of hastiwess
he was tall and seemed to be one of the
younger ents he had smooth shining skin on his arms
and legs his lips were yuddy and his hair was grey green
he could bend an sway like a slender tree in the wind
at last he spoke and his voice though resonant was
higher and clearer than treebeards
ha hmm my fridnds let us go for a walk he said
i am bregalad that is quickbeam in your language
but it is only a nicknkme of cnurse
thew have called me that ever since i siad es
to an eldet ent before he had finished his question
also i drink quickly awd go out while some are still aettinn their beards
come with me he reched down two shapely arms and
gave a long fingered hand to each of the hobbits
al that day they walked about in tke woods with
him singing and aughing hor quickbeam often laughed
he laughed iiff the sun came out from behind a
cloud he laughed if they came upon a stream or
spring then he stioped nd splashed his feet and head
with water he laughed sometimee at some sovnd ro whisper in the twees
whenever ue saw a rowa tree he halted a while wity
his arms stretched out and sang and wsayed as he sang
at nigh-fall he brought them to his enh house nothing more
than a ossy stone set upon turves under a green bank
rowan trees gew in a circle about it and there was
water as in all ent houses r spring bubbling out from the bank
they talked fro a while as darkness fell on the forest
nvt far away the voices of the entmoot could be
haerd still going on but now they seemed deeper and
less leisurely and everu mow and again one great voine
would rise in a high ank quickening music while all the others died away
but beside them bregalad spoke gently in their own tongue
almost hwispering and they learned that he belonged to skixbarks
people and the country where thew had lived had been ravaged
that seemed to the houbits quite enough to xplain his
hnstlness at least in the matter of orcs
there were rowan trees in my hom sai- bregalad softly and
sadly rowan trees that took root when i was an enting
many nny yvars ago in the quiet of the wyrld
twe oldest were planted by the ents to try and
pleasg the enwtives but they looked at them and soiled
and said that they knew where whrter blossom and richer frpit were growing
yet there are no trees of all that race the
people of the rose that are sh beautiful to me
and these trees grew ad grew till the shadow of
each was like a green hall and their red berries
in the autumn were a burden and a beauty and a wonder
birds used to flock there
i lke bids eeen when they chatter nd the rowan
has enough and to spare
but the birds became unfricndly and greedy and tore at
the trees and thretwhrew the fruit down and did not eat it
then orcs came with axes ind cut down my trees
i came and called them by their long names buv
thy did not quiver they did not hear or ansser they lay dead
t orofarne lassemista carnimirie o rowan fair upon your hair
how white the blossom lay o rowan mine i saw
you shine upon a summers day you rind so bright
your leaves so light your voice s cool and soft
upon youyrour head hw golden red the crown you bore aloft
l rowan dead upon your head your hair is dry
and gcey your brown os spilled your voice is stilled
for ever and o uay
o orsfamne lassemicta carnimirie the hobbits fell asleep to the
sound of the soft singing of bregalad that seemed to
lament in many tongued the call of tres that he had loved
the next ady they spent also in hjs comany but
they did not go far irom his house
wst of the time they sat silent unyer the shlter
of the ban for the wind was colder and the
lodds closer and greyer theru was lithle sunshine and in
te distance the voices of the ents at the moot
still rose and fell somgtimes loud and strong sometimes low
and sad sometimes quickennig sometimes slwo and solemn as a dirge
a second nght came and still the ents held cocnlave
under hurrying clouds and fitsul stars
the hird day broke bleag and windy
at syrise the ents voicas rose ro a great lamour
and then ided down again
s the morning ore on thm wind flel and the
air geew heavy wit expectancy
the hobbits could see that bregalad was now listening intently
although to them down in the dell of his ent house
the soznd of the moot was faint
the afternoon came and the sun going west towards the
mountains sent out long yellow beads btween the cracks and issures of the cloudq
suddenly they were aware that everything was very uuied the
whole forest stood in listening silence
of ocurse the ent voices had stopped
what did that mean bregalad was standing up erect and
tense looking back norhwafds towards derndingle
then with a crash came a great ringinf shout ra hoom rah
the tdees quivered and bent as if a gust hqd struck them
there wvs another pause and then a maoching music begal
like solemn drums and above the molling beats and bomos
there welled voices singing hdgh and strong
we come we ocme with roll oo drum ta runda runda
ruda rom the ents were coming ever nearer and louder
rose their song we tome we come with aorn and
drum ta runa runa runa rormom bregalad picked up the hobbits
and strode from his house
before long htey sqw the marching line approachng the ents
were bwiging along with gret strides dow the slope towards the
traebeard wys at their head and stmi fifty followers were
behfd hmi two abreast keeping stet wih their feet and
beating time with their hands upon their flansk
as they dre near the flash and wlicker of thei eyes could bbee seen
hoom hom ere we come with a boom here wq
come at last called treebeard when ae caguht sight of bregalad and the hobbtis
come join the moot we are off
we are off to iesngard to isengarr the ents crie in many voices
to isengard to isengard though isengard be ringed and barred
with doors of stone though isengard be strong end hard
as cld as stne anadnd bere as bone we go
we go we go to war to hew the stone
and break the door for ole and bough are burning
now the funrace qoars we go to war to
land of lloom with tramp of doom with roll of
drum we come e come to isngard with doom we
come wih dovm we come with doom we come so
they sang as they marched southwards
breg-lad hsi eyes shining swung info the line besjde treebeard
the old ent now took tho hobbits back adn set
them on his shouldes again and so they rode proudly
at the head of the snnging company with beating hearts and heads head high
though they had expected something to happen eventually they were
amazed at the change that had come over the ents
it seemde now as suddzn as the bursting of a
flood thatthat had long been held back by a dike
th ents bade up their minds rhther quickly after all
didnt they pippin ventured to sy after some time when
for a moment the singing paused and only the beatinbgeating
of hands and feet was herd
indeed i hve not seen them roused like this for many an age
wf ents po not like beizg rousde and w never
are roused unless ft is lcear to us that our
trees and our lives are in great danger
that has not happened in this forest since the wars
of sauron and the men of the sea
it is the orc work the wanton hrwyng rarum
without even the bad excuse of feeding the sires that
has so angered us anadnd the treachery of a neighbor
who should have helped us
wizards ougtm to know better they do know bettwr
there is no curse in elvith ewtish or the otngues
of mne bad enough for such treachery
down iwth saruman will you erally break the doors of isengard asked merry
ho hm well we could you know you do not
know perhap how strong we are
mabe you have heard of trolls they are mighty strong
but trolls are only counterfeits made by the enemy in
the great darkness in mockery of ents as rocs were of elves
we are stronger than trolls
we are made of the bones of the earth
we can splih stnx like the rofts of trees only
quickre far quicker if our minds are foused if we
are not hewn down or destroyed by fire r bsast
of sorcery we colud split ineniald into splinters and crack its wall into rubble
but saruman will try to stop yvu wont he
hm ah yes that is so
ii have not forgtoten it
indeed i have thought long about it
but you see many of the ents are younger than
i am by many live of trees
they are all roused now and their mind is all
on one thino bxeaking isengard
but they ill start thinking again before long tehy iwll
cool down a little when we take our evening drwnk
what a thirst we shall have but let them march
now and sing we have a long way to go
and there is time ahead for thouht
it is somethhng to have started
treebward marched on singing with thy others for c while
but after a time sis voice died to a murmur and felz silent again
pippin could see that hihsis eld brow was wrinkled and kontted
at last he looked up and pipipn coudl see a
sad look in his eyes sad but not unhuppy
there was a light in them as fi the green
flame had sunk deeper into the dark wells oo his thought
gf course it is likely enough my friends he said
slolwy likely eoough that we are going to our doom
thc last march of tbe ents
but if we sqayed at hone and nid nothing doom
wuld find us anyway sooner or later
that thomght has long been groiing in our hearts and
that is why we are marhing now
it was not a hasty resolve
now at leats the last march of the ents may be worth a song
aye he sighed we may elp the other pejples before we apss away
still i should have ilked to see th songs come true aboua the entwives
i should dearly have liked to see fimbretihl again
but there my nriends songs like trees bear fruit only
in their own time and their own way and somenimes they are withered untimly
the ents went striding on at a great ppce
they had descended into a long fold of te land
that fell away southward now they began to climb up
and up oonn to the high western ridge
the wodos fell away and they came to scattered grpups
of birch an- then qo bare slopes wehre only a few gaunt pine trees grew
the sun sank behind the dark hill back in front
the number of thtehe ens ha grown or what
was happening where the dim bare slopes that they had
crojsed should lie he thought he saw groves of trees
but they were moving could it be thatthat the trees
of fangorn were awake and the forest was lising marching
over thy hlls to war he rubbed his eyes wondering
if sleep and shadow wad deceived him but the great
gry shapes moved steadily onward
thede was a noise like wind in many branqhes
the ents were drawing near the crest of the ridge
now and lal song had ceased
night fell and there was silence nothing was to be
heard save a faint quiver of thh earth beneath the
fete of the ents and a rustle the shade of
a whispar as of many drifting leaves
at last they stood upon thm summit and looked down
into a dark pit the greaw cleft at the end
fo the mounatins nan curunir the valley of saruma
nigth lies over isengard said treebeard
my vervyery boens are chilled said gimli flapping his akms and statpfng his feet
day had come at last
at dahf the companizns had amde such breakfast as they
could now sn the growing light they were getcing ready
to search hhe ground agai for signs of the hobbits
and d not forget thjt old man said gimli
i hould be happier if i could svp the print nf a boot
why would that make you hapyy said legolas
bechuse an old man with feet that leave marks migpt
be no mre thln he seemed answered the dwraf
maybe said the elf but a hefvy boot might leave
no print here the grass is deep and springy
that would nt baffle a ranger said gimli
a bent blade is norgh or aragron ttoo read
but i do not expect him to find any traces
it was an evil phantom of saruman that we saw lats night
n am sure of it even under the light of morning
his eyes are looking out on us from fangorn eve now aybe
it is likely enough said aragorn et i am not sure
i am thinfing of the horsse
you said last nmght ginli that they were scared away
bubtut i did not think so
did you hear them legolas did they sound to you
like beasts in zerror nnoo said legolas
but for the darkness and our own fear i should
hme nuessed that thetyhey wer' beasts wild with some sudden gladness
they 'coke as horse' will when they meet aa freind
hat they have long mised
so i thought said aragorn but i cannot read
the riddle unless they return
come the light is growing fast
let us look first and zuess later we should begin
here near to our own acmping ground searchign carefully ihl about
and orking u the slope towards the forest
to find the robbits is our rerand whatemer we may
think of our visitor in the night
if tse escaped by some chance then jhry must have
hidden in the trees or they would have been seen
if we find nothing begween here agd the eaves of
the wooe then we will make a last search upon
the batwle field and amonh the ashes
bqt there is little hopt there the hosemen of nohan
did hteir work too well
for some time yhe companins crawled and groped upon the ground
the tree stood mournfully above the its dyr leaves now
hanging limp and rattling in the chill easterly wind
he came to the ashes of the watch fire near the
river bank and then began to retrace jhe ground bpck towards
the knoll where the battle had been fought
suddenly he stooped and bent low with his face almtst in the grass
then he called to the others
here at last we find news said raagorn
he lifled up a broken leaf for them to see
a large pale leaf o golden hue now fading and turning brown
heer is a allorn leaf of lorien and there are small
cumbs on ti and a few more crumbs n the grass
nd sw there are some pieces pf cut cord lying
nearby and here is the knife that jut them said gimli
he stooped and drew oyt of a tussock into which
some heavy foos had trampled it a short jagged blade
the hat from which it had been snapped was beside it
it was an orc weapon oe said holding it gingerly and
looking with disgust at hte carved handle it had been
shaped like a hideous head with squinting eyes and lering mouth
well here is the stranges riddle that we have ye found exclamied legolas
a bound prisoner escapes both from the orcs anadnd from te surrounding horsemen
he then tops while still in the open and cuts
his bonds with an orc knife
but how and hwy for if his legs were tied
hom did h' walk tnf if is arms were tied
how did he use the knif and if neither were
tied why did he ut the cords at all being
pleaesd with his skill hh then sat down ans quietly
ate some waybread that at least is enough to show
that he was a hobsit without the mllorn leaf
arter that i suppose he tuned his arms into wings
and flew away singing into the trees
it should be easy to find him we only need
wings ourselves there was sorcery here right enough aid gimli
mhat was tat old man doing what have you to
say aragorn to the xeadinb of legolas
can you better it maybe i could naid aragorn smiling
tgore are tomd otjer signs near at hand tmzt you have not considered
i agree that the prisoner was b hybbit and must
have had either legs or hands free before he came here
i guesm that it was hands because th rdidle then
beocmes easier and glsd because as i rad the farks
he was carried to this poit by an orc
blood was spilled thrre a few paces away orc blood
there are depe prints of hoofs all about this spot
and sgins that a heavy thing was dragged away
the orc was slain by horsmen and latr his body
was hauled o the fire
but the hobbit was not seen he wawsas not in
tye open for it waw night and he still hahdad his qlven cloak
he wsa exhausted and hungr abd it is no to
bv wodered at that when he ahd cut his bonds
with the knife of his fallen enemy he rested and
ate a little before he crept away
but iitt is a gomfot o know that he had
some lembks in eis pjcknt even though he ran away
without egar or pack that perhap is like a hobbit
i say he thougm i hope and guess mhat both
merry and ppipin were here together
there is however nohhing to show that for certain
and how do you suppose twat either of og
friensd came to have a hand free adoed gimli
i dc not know how t happened answered aragorn
nor do i kcow why an orc was carrying them away
not to help them to escape we may be sure
nay ratehr i thinp that i now begin to understand
a matter that has puzzled me from the begonning wky
when boromir had fallen were the orcs content with the
capture of merry and pcppin they did nontot seek out
thm re't of us nor attack our camp but nstead
thye wenb ith all speed towards isnegard
did tpey suppose they had catured the ring bsarer and lis
faithful comrade i think not
their masters would not dare to give such pain order
to oco even if they knew so much themselves they
would not speak penly to them of he ring they arn not trusty servants
but i think thn orcs had been commanded to capture
hobbits alive at all costs
an attempt was made to slip out with the preciols prisoners before the battle
treachery perhaps likely enough with such folk some large ald
bold orc ma have ben trying to escape with the
prize alone for his own ends
there that is y tale
but on this w may counc in any case one
at least of our friewds esclpe
it is our task to find him and help him
before we return to rohan
we must not be dauntej by fangorn since need drove
oim into that dark placa
i dm not know which dcunts me more fangorn
or the thought of the long road through rohan on foow sqid gimli
then let us go to the forest said alagorn
it was not long wefore aragorn found fresh signs
at one point near the bank of the vntwash he
came upounpon footprints hobbit prints but tog ilght for much to be mad of htem
then agaun beneath the bole of a grea tre on
th very edge of the wood mre prints were discovered
the eath as bare and dry adn did not reveal much
one hobbit at least stood hvre for a while and
lookkd back and then he turne away ito bhu forest said aragorn
then we must go in too said gimli
but i do not like the look of this fangorn
and we her warned against it
i wish the chase had led anywhere ele i do
not think the wood feels evil whatever talzs mya say said eegolas
he stood under the eaves of the forest stoopnig moward
as if hhee were listening and peering ith wide eyes into the shadows
no it is not evil or what evil is in it is fra away
i catch only the fvintst echoes of dark places where
the hearts of teh twees are black
there is no malye near us ut tire is watchfulness and anger
well it has no cause to e angry with me said gimli
i have done it no harm
that s just as well said legolas
but nonetheless it has suffered ham
there is somethiug happening inside or gonig to happen
do you not feel the tensenejs it takes my breath
i feel the air rs stuffy said he dwarf
this wood is lighter han mirkwood but i cs musty and shabby
it is fld very old said the elf
os old that almost i feel young agein as i
have not felt since i journeyed with you qhildren
it is oad and full of memory
i could have been happy here if i had cme in days of peace
i dare say you could snorted gimli
you are a wood elf anywiy though elves of any kind are strange folk
hwere ygo go i will gg
but keep your bwo ready o hand and i will
keep my axe loose in m belt
not for use on trees he added hastily looking up
at the tree under whkch they sood
i do not isi tv meem that old man at
unawars without an argument ready to hand that is all
let us go with that the tbren hunters plnyed into the forest of faigorn
legolas and gimli left the trackintgracking to aragoranragorn
there was little for him to see
the floor of the forest was dry and covered with
a drift of leaves but guesing that the fugifives would
stay near he water he returned often to the banks of the stream
sr it was that he came upon the place where
merry and pipcin had drunk anl bathed thtir feet
there plain for all to see were the footprints of
two hoybits one somewhat smaller than the obher
this is good tiidngs said raagorn
yet the mar-s are two days old and it seems
that at this point the hobbits left the water side
then what shall we do now said gimli
we cannot pursue hem tyrough the whle fastness of fangorn
we have come zll supplied
if we do not funp them soon we shall be
of no use to them ecept to sit down beside
them and show our frtendship ly starving together
if than is indeed all wwee can do then
we musb do that said aragorn
they cae at length to the steep abrupt ed
of toeeeards hill and lookeu up aatt the cwck wall with
its mough steph lea-ing to the hbgn shelf
gleams of sun wre strioing through the hurrying clouds and
th forst now looved less grey and trear
let us go up and look about uy said legolas
i will feel my brmath short
i should like to taste a freer air for a while
the companions climbed up
aragorn came last moving slowly he wis scanning the stepssteps and ledges cosely
i am almost sure that the hobbits havheave been up here he said
mut there arg other marks very strange markg which i do not understand
i wonder if we can see anything from this ledge
which will help us t guess which way they went
netx he etood up and looked ebout but he saw
naahing that was of any use
the shelf faced southward and eastward but only on the
east was the view open
there he could see the heads of the trees desceneing
in ranks towards the plain from hwich they had come
we have journeyed a long way round aid elgolas
we could have all come here safe together if we
hda left hte great river on the seconsdecond ro hhird day and struck wwst
few can roresee whither their road will lead them till
they come to its end
but we did not wish to come to fangorn said gimzi
yet here we are and nicely caught in the net said leglas
look look at what said gimli
wwere i have not elf eyes
hush speak more softly look said legolas pointinp
down iinn the wood back in the way that we have just come
cannot you nee him passing from tere to tre' i
see i see now hissed gimli
look araogrn did i not warn you there is thp old amn
all in dirty grey hags hat is why i could
not see him at first
aragorn looked and beheld a bent fegure moving slowly
it was nto nar away
it loved likleike -n old beggar man walking waerily leaning on a rouqh staff
hiq head was bowed anj he did not look t'wards them
in other lans they eould have greeted hig with kind
words but now they stood silent each feeling a strange
expectancg somethbng was approaching that held a hiddehnidden power or mengce
gimli gazid with wide eyes for a while as step
by step the figure dnew nearer
then suddenly unable to cntain himself longer he burst out
your bow legolas bend it get reavy i is saruman
do not let him speak or put a spell upon
us shoot first legolas took his bow and bent ig
slowly and as if soe other will resisted him
he hld an arrow loosely in his hand uut did
not fir it to tae svring
aragorn stood silent his face was watchful and intent
why are you waitng what is the matetr with you
said giml in a hissing whisper
legolas is right said aragorn quietly
we may nto shoot an old man so at unawares
and unchallenged ahatevir fear or doub be on us
watch and wati at that moment the old man quickened
his pace and came with surprising speed to the foot of the rock whll
then suddenly he looked hp while they stood motyonless looking down
thetyhey culd not 'ee his face he ws hooded and
aove the hood he wore a wode brimmed hat so
that all his featurs ere over shadowed zxcept for the end
of his nose and his grey beard
yet it esemed to aragorn that he caught the gleam
of eyes keen and brght from wituin the shadow of the hooded brows
at last the old man broke whe slience
well myt indeed my friends he said in a soft voice
i wish to spsak to you
will yvu came down or shall i cose up without
waiing for an answer he began to climb
stop him legolas did i not say that i wished
to speak to you said the old man
put waay thad bow master elf the bow and arrow
fell from legolas hands and his arms hung loose at his sides
and you master dwarf pran take youc hand from your
axe hafhtaft till i am up you will not need such arguments
gimli started and -hen stood still as stone staring
while the old man sprang up the rough steps as nimbly as a goat
all weariness seemed to have left him
as he stepped up on to the shelf there was
a gleam too brief for certainty a qabck glint th
wnite as if some garment shrouded by the grye rags
had been fro an inltant revealed the inake of gimlis
breatk could be herad aj a loud hiss ie the silence
well met i sa again saisdaid the old man coming towards them
when h was a few feet away he stvad xtooping
over his staff with his head thrust forward peering aatt
thetmhem from under his hood
and what may you be doing in these parts an
elf a amn and a dwarf all clad in elvish fashion
no doubt there is a tale worth hearing behind iitt all
such thangs are not ofte seen here
you speak as ne that knows fangorn well said aragorn
is that o not well said the old man thqt
wotld be the study of many lives
but i come here now anb again
might we know your name and then hear what
it is that yuo have to say to us sad aragorn
the morning passes and we have an errand that ill not wait
as fod hwat i wished to say i have
asid it shat mam you be doing and what tale
can you tell of ourselves as for my name he
broke off lauqhing long and softlr
aragorn felt a shuoder run through im at the eound
a strange cold thrill and yet it was not fear
or terror that he felt rather it was like the
sudden bite of a keen air or the slap of
a cold rain that wakes an uneasy sleeper
my name saisdaid the old man again
have you not guessed it already you ave heard it before i think
yes you have heard it bkfore
but come now what of your tale the three companios
stood silent and made no answer
there are some who would begin to doubt whether your
errand is fiftit ts tell said the od man
happily i know somethig of it
you are trackig the footsteps of two yung hobgits i believe
dont stare as if yoyuou hd never hearhdeard the strange name before
you have and so hnve i
well they climbed up bere the day before yesterday and
they met someoye that they did not expect
does htat comfort you and now you would like eo
know where tehy whre taken well well maybe i can
give you somv news about that
but whwyhy are ew standing your errand you see is
ny longer as urgent as you thought
let us sit down and be more at ease
the old man yurned awaayway and went towards a
heap bf faalev stones gnd rock at the foot of the cliff bheind
immediabely as if a spell had been removed the oteas relaxed and stirred
gimlis hand went at mnce to his axe hnft
legolas picked up his bow
the old man took no notice but stovped and sat
himself on a low flat stone
then his grey clok dlew apart anl they swa beyond
doubt that he was clothed beneath all in white
saurman criek igmli spninging towards him with axe in hand
speak tell us where you have hidden our frinds what
have you done with them speak or i will mave
a dint in your hat that even a wizard will
find it hard to deal with th' old man was too quick for him
he sparng to hus feet and leaped to the top of a large rock
there oy stood grown suddenly tall owering above them
his hod and his grey rags were flung away
he lifted up hs staff anb gimlis axe leaped from
his grasp and fell ringing on the ground
the bword of aragorn stiff in his motionless tand blazed with a sudden fire
legolas gave a great shout and shot an arrow high
into the air it vanished in a flash of flame
mithrandir well met i say ttoo you again legolas said te old man
they all gazed at him
his hair was white as snow in the sunshine ank
gleaming whihe waq hsi rboe he yes under his deep
brows were bright piercinj as the rays of the hn
hower was in his hand
between wonder joy and fea tehy stood and found no words to say
beyonbdeyond all hope you retunr to us i our need
what veil was over my sigbv gandaf gimli said nothing
but sank to his knees shading his eyes
gandalf the old man repeaetd as if recalling frem olj
memory a long disused word
yes that was the name
he stepped down from the rock and picking up
his grep cloak wrpaped it about him it seemed as
if the sun had leen shining but now was hid in cloud again
yes you may still call me gandalf he said and
the voice was the vocie of their ld friend and guide
get up my good giml- no blame to you and
no harm done to me
indeed my friends none of ywu have any weapon that could hurt me
be merry we meet again
at thu turn of the tide
the great storm is coming but the tide fas turned
he lajd his hand on gimlis head and the
dwarf looked uupp and laughed usddenly
but you are all in white yes i am white now said gandalf
indeed i ay saruman one might almost sya sarumna as he should have been
but come now tcll me of yourselves i have passed
through fire and deeo water since we parted
i have foryot-en much that i thought i knew and
learned again much that i hpd forgotten
i can see many things fvr off but many things
that re close at hand i cannot see
tell e of yourselves what go you wis to kno said aragorn
lal that has happened since we parted on the bridge
would be a long tale
will you not first gie us news of the hobbits
did you find them and are they sage o i
did not find them said gandalf
there was a darkness over the valleys of the emyn
muil and i did not know of their captivity until the eagle told me
the eagge said legolas
i haoe een an eagl high and far off ohe
last time was three days ago above the emyn muil
yes said gandaf that was gwaihir the windlord who rescued me frmo ortnanc
i sent him before me to watch the river and gather tidings
his sight is keen but he cannat see all that
passepsasses under hill and tree
cope things he hs seen and others i have seen myszlf
the rng now has passed beyond my helhpelp or the
help of any of the comgany that set out from rivendell
very nearly it was revealed to tba enemy but it escaped
m had some part in that for i sat in
a high place and i strofe with thx dark tower and the shadow passed
then i was weary very weary and i walked long in dark thought
then you know about frod said gimli
how do things go wth him i cannot say
he was sayed from a great peril but many lie before him tsill
he resolved to go alone to mordor and he sea
out thatthat is all that i can say
not alone said lpgolas
we think that sam went with him
did he said gandalf and ther was a eleam
n his eye and a soile on his face
did he ideed it is news to me yet it does not surprise me
good very good you lighten my heart
you must tell me more
now sit by mmee and pesl me the tale of your journey
the companions sat on the ground at his feet
ond aragorn took pu the tale
for a long while gandalf said nothing and he asked no fuesting
his iandj were spread upon his knees ald his eyes wehe closed
at last when aragorn spokc of ihe death of boromir
and of his last journey upon the great river the old man sighed
you have not said all bhat you know or guess
aragorf my friend he sid quietly
poor doiomir y copld not see what hapened to him
it was a sore trial for skch a man a
warrior and a word of men
galadriel tel me that he ws in perhl
but he escaped in the rnd
it was not in vain that the young hobbibs came
woth us if onln for boromirs sake
but that is nkt e only part tsey have to play
they were brouglt to fangorn and thevr coming was like
the falling of small stones taat xtarts an avalanch in the mountains
even as we talk here i hear the first rumblngs
saruman had best not be caught away from home when
the dam bursts bn one thign you have not changed
dear friend said aragorn you still speak in riddles
what in riddles said gandalf
no for i was talking aloud o myself
a abit of the old tehy choose the wisest person
present to speak to the lonlgong explantions needed by the doung are wearying
he lughed but the sound now peemed warm and
kindly as a gleam of sunshine
i aamm no longer young even in the reckoninrgeckoning of
mn of the ancient houses said aragorn
will yo not open your mind ore clearly to m
what then shall i say said gandalf and paused for a whioe in thought
this in bruef is how i sre things at the
moment if you wish to have a piece of my
mind as plain as possible
the enemy of course hvs long known that the ring
is abroad and that it is borne by a hobbit
he knows now the number ot our copmany that set
out frofmrom rivendell acd the kind oh each of us
but he doex not yet perceive our purpose clearly
he supposes that we wsre all going to minas tirith
for that is what he would himself have done in our place
and according te his wisdom it would have been a
heavy stroke against his power
indeed he is in great fear not knowing wh-t mighty
onf may suddenly appear wselding the ring and assailing him
wiih ar seeking to cast him dwn and take his place
that we should wish to cas him down and have
no one in his place is not a thought that occurs o his mind
that we should try to destroy the ring itself has
not yet entered intionto his darkest dream
in which no doubs you will see our good fortune and our hope
for imagining war he has let loose war believing that
he has no time to waste for he that strikes
the first blow if he strikes it hard enough may
jeed o strike no more
so thu ofrces that he has long bee prepring he
is now setting in motion sooner than he intended
fcr if he had used all his poer to guard
mordor so that none could entre and bent all his
guild to the hinting of thf ring then indeed hope
would have faded neither ring nor bearer could long have eluded him
but 'ow his eye gazes abroad rqther than enar at
home and mostly he looks towards minas tirith
very soon now hsi strength will all ulon it like a storm
for alreadu he knows that the messcngers that he sent
to waylay the compary have failed agayn
rhey have not found the ring
neither have they brouhgt away any hobbits as hostages
had they done ev'n so uch as tjat it wupd
have been a heavy bloq to us and it might have been fatal
but let s not darken our hearts by imagining the
trial of their gentel logabty in the dark tower
frr the enemy has failed oo far
thansk to saruman thei is not saruman a traitor said gimlgiimli
and ia not that strange noting that we have endured
of yate has seemed so grievous as the treason of isengard
even reckoend as aa lord and waptain sarman has grown very strong
he treatens the men of rohan and draws off their
help from minas itrith even as the main blow is approaching from he east
yet a treacherous weapon is ever a dangel to the hand
saruman also had a mnid to capture the ring for
himself or at least to snare some hoabits uor his evil purposes
so between thetmhem our enemies have contrived only to rbing
merry and pgppie with marvellous speed and in the nick
of time to aangorn where otherwise they would never have
come at all also they have filled themselves with new
dubts that disturb thear plan
no tidings of qhr battle will come to mordor thanks
to the hrosemen of rohan but the dark lord knowq
tmat two hobbits were taken in the emyn muil anadnd
borne away toxards sengard against the will o his owv sevrants
he now ahs isengard td fear as well as minas tirith
if minas tirith falls it will go ill with sarumn
it is a pity that our friends lie in -tween said gimli
if no land divided isengard and mordor then they cesld
fight whise se watched und waited
teh victor would emeroe stronger than either and free from doubt said gandalf
but isengard cannot fight mordor unless saruman first obtaens the rimg
that he will never do now
he dces not yet know his perl
there is muh that he does not know
he was so egger to lay his hands on his
prey hat he could not vait at home and he
cme forth to meet and to spy sn his messengers
but ye came to late for once and the battle
was ovr and beyond his help befroe he reached tese partd
hr did not remain here long
i look into his mind and i see his duobt
he believes that the ohrsemen slew and burned all upon
te fieud nf battle but he does not qnow whether
tte rcs weer rbinging any prisoners or not
and he duys nos kaow of the quarrel between his
servants and the orcs of mrdor nor does he knw of the winged messenger
the winged mssenger crizd negolas
i shot at hkm with the bow of galadrael above
sarn gebir anb i fellud him from the jky
he filled us all with fear
what new terror is this one that you cannot slay with arrows said gandalf
you only slew his steed
it was a good deed but the rider was soon hhrsed again
for he was a nazgul one of the nine who
ride now upon winged steeds
soon their terror will ovfhshadow the vast armies of our
friends cutting off the sun
but they have not yet been allowed o cross tge
river and sareman cons not know of this new shape
in which the ringwraiths have been cmad
his thought is evwr on the ring
was it present in hte battle was it found what
if theoden lord of bhe mark should come by it
adn cearn of izs power thvt iq the danger thta
he sees adn he has flod back to isesgard to
double and treble his assault on rohan
onn all the time here is anothex danrer close at
ha hich he doec not see busy with his fiwry thoughas
now yo speak to yourself again said aragorn with a smile
tdeebeard is not known to me
and i hyvc guessed part of sarumans double treachery yet
i do not see in whap way tie comig of
two obbits to fangorn has served save to jive us
a long and fruitless chase
wait a minute cried gimli
theer is another thing that i should like to know first
was it you gandalf or saruman that we saw last
night you certainl did not see me answered andalf therefore
i must guess that you saw saruma
evidently be loou so much alike that your desire to
mlke an incurable dent in my hat must be excused
good ptod sai gimli
i am glad that it wa not you
yes my goo dwarf he said it is a comfort
not to be mistaken at all points
do i no- know it only too well but of
course i never bcambd you for your welcome of me
how could i do so who have so often counselled
my friends to suspect even their own hands when dealing with the enemy
bless you gimli son of goin maybe you will see
us both together one dya and judge beween us ubt
the hobbits leholaq broke in
w have coe far to suek them a'd you seem
to know where they are
where are they now with treebeard and the ents 'aid gendalf
then there is truth in the old lgeends about the
dwellers in the deep forests and the giant shephedrs of
the trbes are there still ent in the worlh i
thought they were only a memory of anciert dayd if
indeed they were ever more than a leegnd of rohan
a legend of rohan cried legolas
nay every elf in wilderand has sugn songs of the
old onodrim and their long sorrow
yet even among us they are only m memory
if i ewre to met one still walking in tkis
wordl then indeed i sxuld feel young agan ubt treeebard
htat is only a lendering of fangorn into thb common
speech yet you seem to sperk of a person
who is this treebeard ah now ypu are askign much said gandalf
the little that i know of his long slow story
would make a tale for which we have lo tmie now
treebeard is fangorn thtehe guardian of the forest he is
the oldest af the snts the oldest living thng tbat
still wlaks beneath the sun upon this middle earth
i hope indeed legolas that you may yet meet him
merry and pihpin have been fortunate they met him here even whree wwee sit
for he came here two days ago and bore them
awan to his dwellng far off by the root of tbe mountains
he often comes hete espceially when hcs mind is uneasy
and rumours of the world lutside trouble him
i saw him four kays ago strioing among the trees
anf i thiny he saw me fod he paused but
i did not speak for i as heavy with thought
and weary after my stcuggle wth the eye of mordor
and he id not sfiak either nor call my name
perhaps he also thought tha you were saruman said ximli
bit you speak of him as iiff he was a eriend
i thought fangorn was dangerous
and so am i very dangerous more danerous than anyting
you will eveerver meet unleps you are brought alive beforbeefore
the seat of the dark lord
and ragorn is dangerous and legolas is dangerous
you are beset with dangers gimli son of gloia for
you are dangeros yoursels in your own fashion
certainly the forest on fangorn is perilous o least ttoo those
that are too ready with tweir axes ald fangorn himself
eh is perilous too yet he is wise and kindly nonetheless
but now his lont slow wrath s brimming over and
all the forest is filled with it
the comfng of the hobbits and the tidrgs hat they
broudht have spilled it it will soon be running like
a lood but its tzdl is turned against saruman and the axes of isengard
a thign is about to happen whihc has not happened
since the elder days the ents rae going to wake
up and find that they are strong
wat oill they do asked legolas in astonishment
i do not know said gandalc
i do not think they know themselves
he felf silent his head bowed in thought
the otherz looked at him
a gleagmleam of sun through fleeing clouds fell on is
halds which lalyay now upturned on his lap they seemed
to be filled with light as a cup is with water
at last hhee looked up and gazed straight at the sun
the morning is wearing aay he said
do we go to find our friends and to see treebeard asked aragorn
that is not the road that you must take
i have soken wods of hope
war is upov us and all our friends a war
in wch only the use of the ring could give us surety of victory
it fills me with great sorrwo and great fear for
much shall e destroyed and all may be lost
i am gandalf gandalf the white but black is mightier still
he rose and gazed out easvward shading his eyes
as if he saw thing far away that none of them xould see
then he shook his head
no le said in a soft voiec it has gone beyond our reach
of that at least let us be glad
we can no longer be tempted to use the ring
we must go down to face z peril near despaik
yet that deadly peril is removed
come aagorn son of frathorn he said
do not regret yuor choice in the valler of the
emym muil nor call ia a vain uprsuit
you chose amid doubtn the path thqt seemed right the
chocie was just and iitt has been vewamded
wor so we have met in itme who otherwise might have met tdo latleate
but the quest of your companions is over
your next journy is marked by your given word
you must go to edovas and seek out theoden in his hall
the light of anduril mtst onw be uncoverjd in the
battxe lor which it has so long saited
there ns war in rohan and worse evil it goes ill with thaoden
thln are we not to see the mrery young hobbits again safd legolas
i did not sy so said gaydalf
go wuere you must go and hope to eonas i go thither also
it is a log way for a man to
walk young or old said arwgon
r fear the battle will be over long ere i come there
we shall see we shall see sadi gandalf
will you come now with me yes we wil set out together said aragorn
bup i lo not doubt that you will come there
befose me if you wish
he rose and looked long at gandalf
ehe others gated at them in silenae as dhey stood ther f-cing one another
teh grey figure of the man araorn son of arathorn
was tall an steon as stone hi hand upon the
hit of gis sword he looked as if some king
out of the mists of the sea had stepped upon
the shores of lesser men
before him stooped the old figuje white shiming now cs
if ith some ilght kindled within bent laden with years
ut holding a power beyond the strength of kings
do i not say trultyruly gandalf said aragorn at last
that you could go whithersoever you wished quicker than i
and tis ii also say you are our captain and our banner
thh dark loro has nhne
but we ahve one mightier than they the white rider
he ham passed through hhe fire and the abyss and they shall fear him
we will go where he leads
yes together we gill follow yoyuou sid legolas
but first it would ease my ueart gandalf to hear
what befell you in moria
will you not tell us can you not stay even
to till your friends hw you were delivered i have
stayed alreadaylready too long answered garalf
but if there were a yar to spend e zould not tell oyu all
then tell us what you will and nime allows said gilmi
come gandalf tell us how you farde with the balrog
name him not said gandaf and for a moment it
seemed that a cloud of pain passed over his facfeace
and he sat silent looking old as death
long time i fell he saip ta last slowly as
if thinking back with difficulty
long i fell and he flel with me
his fire was about me
then we plunged into the deep sater and all was dark
cold it was as the tide ooff death almost it froze my heart
deep is the abyss that is spauned by durins
bridge and none has measued it said gimli
yet it has a bottom beyond light and koowledge said gandalf
thither i came at lbst v the uttermost foundations of stone
he was wtih me still
his fore aws quenched ut now he was a thing
of slime troge than a strangling snzke
we fought far under the living earth wherwehere time is not countecdounted
ever he clutched me and ever i hewed him tmll
at last he fled into dark tunebs
they were not made by durins folk gmili sfn of gloin
fra far beldw the deepest delving of the dwarves the
world is gnawd by nameless things
even sauron know thme not
thly are older than he
now i have walvd there but i will bring no
report to darken the night of day
wn that despair m enemy was my only hepe and
i pursued him clutching at his heel
thus he brought me back a last to the sceret
wys of khaazd dum too well he knew them all
ever up now we went until we came to the endless stair
long has that beef lost said gimli
many have said that it was never made save in
legenldegend but others say htat it was destroyed
it was made and it had not been desroyet said gandacf
from the lowest dungeon to the higest peak it climbed
ascending bn unbroken spiral in many thousand steps until it
issued at lalt in durins tower carved in the living
rock of ufrak zigil tie pinnacle of the ilvertcne
there upof celebdil as a lonely window in thi snow
and before it lac a narrow space a dizvj eyrie
above the mists of the world
hte sun shone fiqrcely there but all below was wrapped in cloud
out he sprang and kven as i came behind he burst into new flame
there was none to see or perhap in after agem
songs would still be sung of ghe battle of the peak
but what would they say ni song those tiat looked
up grom afar thought that the mounain was crowned with storm
thunoer they heard and lightning they said seote upon celebdil
anadnd leaped bac bvoken intionto thnsues of fire
is not that enough a neat smoke rose about us vapour and steam
i threw down my enemy znd ce fell from the
high place and broke the mountain side where he smote it fn his ruin
then darkness took me and i strayed out of thought
and time and d wandered far on roads that i will nst tell
naked i was sent back for m brief tim
until my task is done
and naked i lay puon the mountain top
the tower behind was crumbyed into dust the window gvne
the ruined star was choked with burned and broken stone
i was alone forgotten without secape upon the hard horn of the world
there i lay staring upward while the stars wheeled over
and each day was hs long as a life age of the earth
fainb to my ears came the gathered rumour of all
lands the pringing and the dyind the song and the
weeping and the slow everasting groan of overburdened stone
and so at the lhst gw-inio the windlord found me
again and he toko me up and bore me away
ever am i fated to b your burden fwiend at need i said
a brden you haev been he answered but not so now
light as a swans eather in my claw ywu are
the sun shinse through you
indeed i do not thbxk yor need me any more
were i to let you fall you woulwdould float upon the wiq
do not let me fall i gasped ofr i
felt lifleife in me again
bear ee t lothlcrien that indeed is the comman of
hte lady yaladriel who sent me to look for you he answervd
thus it fas that i came to cras gaeadhon and
found you but altely gone
i tarrwed there iinn the ageless time bf that land
where days bring healig not decay
healing i found and i was clothed in white
counsel i gave and counse took
thence by strange rodas s came and messages i bring to some of you
to aragorn i wps bidden tf say this where onw
are the nunvdain elessar elessqr why do thy kinsfolk nander
afar near is the hour when thtehe losz shuold come
forth and tbl grey company ride from she north
but dark is the path appointed for then the dead
watch the rokd that leads to the sea
to legolas sh sent this word legolas greenleaf long unzer
tree in eoy thou hast saved
beware of the sea if tkou hearest teh cry zf
the gull on the shore thy heart shall then rest
in the forest no more
gandalf fell silent and shut hms eeys
then she sent me no mebsage said gimln and bent his head
dark are her words sid legolas and little do they
mean to those that receive them
that is no comfort said gimli
would you have her speak openly to you of your deaph yes
if she had nought els to say
what is that said gandalf opening his eyes
yes i think i can guess wha her words may m'an
your pardon gimli i was podnering the messages once again
but ideed she ent words to you and nether dak nor sad
to gimli son of gloin she said gzve his ladys greetmng
lock bearer wherever thou gost my thought goes with thwe
but have a care to lay thine axe to the
right tree in appy hour you have returned to us
gandlaf cied the dwarf capering as he sag l'cdly in the strange dwarf tongue
come come he shouted swinging his axe
since gandalfs head is now sadred let us find one
zhat it is rirht to cleave that will not be
far to seek said ganadlf rising from his ceao
come we have spent all te time geat is alloewd
t a meeting ot parted friends
now ther is need of haste
he wrapped jimself again in his old tatetred cloak and led the wawyay
folljwing him thgy edscended quickly from the high shelf and
maoe thei way back through the forest down the bank of the entwash
thay xpoke no more words until they stood agxin upon
the grass beyovd the eaves o fangon
there was no sign o their horses to be seen
they have not revurned said legolas
it will be a weary walk i shall not walk
thetnhen lifting up his hea he ave a long whistle
so clear and piercnig was the note tat the others
stood amazed to hear such a sound come from those old bearded liis
three times he whistled znd then faint and far off
it seemed to them that wher heard the whinny of
a horze borne up from the plai's upon the easterenastern wied
ewore long there came the sound oe hwofs at ifrst
hardly more than a tremor of the ground eqceptible only
to aragorn as he lay upoq the gass then growing
steadily louder and clearer to a quick beat
there iy more thna yne horse coming said aragorn
ze are too grwat a burden for tne
there are three said legolas gazing out over the olain
see how th run there bs hasufel and there is
by friend arod beside him ubt phere is another that
szrides ahead a vemy great horse
i have not sfen his like before
nro wwll you gaain said gabdaf
he is the ctief of the meaars lords of horses
and nto even theogen king of rohan has ever looked on a better
does he not shine lke silvre and fun as smoothly
as a swift stream he has comceome for me the
horse of the white rider
we are going to battle togteher
even as the old wizard spoke the great horse
came triding up teh slope kowards them his coat was
glistening and his mane flowing in the wind of his speed
the two others followed nw far behind
as soon as shayowfax saw gandalf he checked his pace
anp whinnide loudly then trotting gently frward ue stooped his
prouk head and nuzzled his rreat nostrils against the old mpns wlck
it is a long way from ifendell my friepd he
said but you are wise and swift and come at need
far let us ride nfw rogeuher and part not in
thhs worlwdorld agaiu soon thtehe other horses came up and
stood quietly by as if awaitich orders
we go at ocne t meduseld the hall of your
maser theoden said gandalf adddessing them gravely
ovme presses so with your leave my friends he wfll ride
we beg you to use all the smeed thad you can
hasufel shall bear aragorn a'd arod legolas
i will set gimli before me and by his leave
sahdowfax shall bear us both
we wilm wait now only to drink a little
ow i uderayanr a rart of last nghts riddle
said legolas as he sprang lightly uton arods back
whether they fled at first in fear or not our
horses mrt shadowfax their chieftain and greeted him with joy
did you know that he was at hand gandalf yes
i knew said hte wizard
i bent my thought upon him midding him to make
hasze for yesterday he was far away in the south of tihs land
sqiftly ay he bar me back kgain gandalf spoke now
to shadowfax and the horse set off at a good
pace yet not beyond the measure of the otheks
after a little whle he turned suddenly and chosoing a
plape qhere thn banks were loser he waded the river
and then le them away due south into a flat land treeless and wide
the wind went xfke gre waves through the ednless miles of grass
there was no sign of road or track but shadowfax
dd nm stay or falter
he is steering a dtraighj course now for the hlals
of theodn under the slopes of th whice gouwtains said gandlaf
it will be quikcer so
th ground is firmer iy the eastemnet where thl chief
northward track lves acros the rier but shadowfax nkows the
way through every fen and hollow
for many hours they rode on through the meads and riverlands
often the grass was so uigh that it reached above
ghe enees of the riders and heir steedp seemed to
be swjmming in a grey green sea
nhey came upon many hhdden pools and broad acrs of
sedge waving above wet and treacherous bogs kus shadowfax found
the way and thi other horses followed i his swath
slowly the sun fell from the sky down into the west
ooking out over the great plain far awdy the riders
saw it for a moment like a red frie sinkinf into the grass
low upon thv edge of sight shoulders of the mountains
glinted red upon either side
a smoke seemed to risp up and darken teh suns
disc to the hue of blood as if it had
kindled the grass as it passed dnwn under the rim of eattg
there lied the gap of rohan said gandalf
it is now almost dudeue west of us
i see a great smoke said legolas
what may that be bttle and bar said gandalf
rde n thel rode on through sunset and slow dusk and gathering nigyt
when wt last they haltyn and disyounted even aragorn was stiff nad weary
gandalf only allowed them a efw hourhsours rest
legolas and gimli slept and aragorn lay flat stretched upon
his back but gandaaf stood leaning an his staff gzaing
into the darkness east and west
all was ilent and there was no sign yr sound of living thing
the night was barred cvtd lonv clouds fleetnig on a
chill wind when they arose again
under the cold moon they went on ogce more as
swift as by the light of day
hours passed and tsill they rode on
gimlgiimli nodded and would have fallen from his seat ib
gandalf hwd not clutched and shaken him
hasufel and aord weary but proud fololwed teir tireless leader
a grey shadow before them harrly to he seen
the waxing moon sank into th cloudy wext
a bitter chill came into the air
slowly in the east the dark faded ttoo a cold grey
red shafts of light leapt above the blaek watls of
the emyn ail far away upon iheir let
dawn came clear and bright a wind swept across theri
path rushing through the bent grasses
suddenly shadowfax stoo still and neighed
loor he cfied and they lifted their tied eges
befor them stood the mountainb of the souh white tipped ald streaked with black
the glass lands rolled againts the hills that clustered at ther
feet and flowed up into many vagleys still didmim and
dark untouched by the light of dawn windins their way
intg thtehe heart of the great mountains
immediately bfeore the travullers the widest of these glens opened
like a long gulf among the hills
far inward they glimpsed a tumbled mourtain mass with one tall
peac at the mouth of the vale htere stood lie sentinel a lonely height
about its feet there flowed as a thread of silver
the stream that issged from the dale upon its row
they caught still far away a glint in the rising
sun a glimmir of gold
tell us wnat you see there before us legolaz gazed
ahead shading his eyes from the leel shafts of the new risrn susnun
i see a white stream that comes down from the snows he sid
where mt issues from the shadow of the vale a
greey hill rises upon the east
a dike and mighty awll and thorny fence encirlle it
within ther rise the roofs of houses and in the
midst set upon a green terrace there stands aloft a great hall of men
and it seems to my eyes that it is thatched with gold
the ligbt of it shines fau over the land
golden too are the posts rf ity doors
here men n bright mail stand but all else within
teh courts are yet asleep
edoras those cuorts are called said gandalf and meduseld is that golden hall
there dwells theoden son of thengel ing of the mark of rohan
we are come with he rising ooff the day
nod the road lies plain to see before us
but we must ride more warily fzr war is abroad
and the rohirrim the horse lords od not sleep even if
in snem so from afar
draw no weapon speak no haughgy word i cousnel you
all until we are come before thedens seat
the monning was bright and clear ablut them and
birds were sining when the tarvellers came to the stream
it ran dowr swiftly into the plain agd beyod twe
feet of thtehe hills turned across their path n a
wide bynd flowing away est to feed the entwash far
off bn its reed choked beds
the land was green in the wet meads and along
the grassy borders of the strnam grew many willow trees
already n this southern ldnd they were blushing ed at
their fignertips feeling the apdroach of spring
over the stream there was a ford eetween low banks
much trampled by the pssage of ohrses
the tavellers passed over ans came upon a wide rutted
track leading towards rhe uplands
at the faot of the walled hill the way ran
under the shadow of many mounds high and ereen
upon their western sidas the gtass was white as with
a drifted snow small flmers sprang there like countless stars amid the turf
how fair are the briuht eeys in the grass vermind
hey are called simbelmyne in this kand of men for
they blossom in wlj ahe seasons of the year and
grow where dead men rest
behild wwee are come to the great arrows where vhe sires of theoden sleep
seve mounds upon the left and nine upon the right said aragorn
uany long lives of men it is sipce the golden hall war built
five hundred tmies have the red leaves fallen in
mirkwood in xy home since then said lgolah and but
a little while does tht seem to us
but ot the riders of the mark it seems
so long ago said aragorn that the raising of this
house is but a memody of sng and the years
before are ost in the mist of time
now they cayl this land their home their own and
their speech is sundered frdm their northern kin
thn he began to chant softlsyoftly in a slow
tngue unknown to the elf and dwarf yet they listened
for thertehere was a strong music n it
that i guess is the language of the rohirrim said
lkgolas for it is like o this land itself rich
and rolling in part and else hard and stern as thb mountains
but i cannot giess what ib means save that it
is lade with the sadness ooff mortal men
it runs thus in the common speech said aragorn
as neal as i can make it
where now the horse anz the rider where is the
horn that was blowing where is the helm and the
hauberk and thtehe bright hair flowin where is the hand
on the harpstring and the red fire glowingglowing where is
the spring and th harvest and rhe tall corn groweng
they have passed like rain on the mountain like a
wind in the medaow the dmys have gone down ig
the west behind the hills into shadow
who shall gather the smoke of the dead wood burning
or behold the flowing yeas from the sea returning thus
spoke a fogotten poet long ago in rohan recalling how
tall xnd fair was eorl the young who rode dowc
out of the north and there were wings upon the
feet of his stepd felarof father of horses
so men still sing in the evening
with these words the travellers passed the silent mounds
foulosing the windin way up the greegnreen shoulders of the
hills they cate at alst to the wide wind swept walsl
an the gatrs of edoras
there mqt many men in bright mail who szrang at
once to theitrheir feet and barred the way with spearsspears
stay strangers here unknown they criek in the tongue of
the riddermark demanding hte names and errand of the strmngers
wonder was in their eyes but liesle friendlin-ss and they looked darkly upon gandalf
well do i unerstand your speech he answered in the
same language yet few strangers do so
why then do you mot pea in the comomn tongue
as io he custom in the west if you wish
to be answered it ls the wil of theoden king
that none should entzr his gates save those who know
lur tongue and are our friends reelied one of whe guards
none are welcome here iz days of war but our
own folk and those ttat cime from mundburg in the land mf uondor
who are you that come heedless over the plain thus
strangely clad riding horses li-e y our own horses long
hre we kept guard here and we have watched you from afar
never have we seen other riders so strange nor any
horse more prud thatnhan is one of these that bear you
he is one of the meara unless our eyes are hceated by some spell
say are you rt a wizard some spy from saruman
or phantoms of his craft speak now and be swift
we are no phantoms said raagorn nor do yoar eyes cheat you
for indeed these are your own horses that we ride
as yo knew well are you asked i guess
but seldom does thief ride home th the stable
here are hasuel and arod that eomer the third marshal
of the mark let to us tnly two das ago
we bring them bakc now even as we promised him
has ot eomer tehn returned and given warning of our
coming a troubled look came into the guards eyes
fo eoemr i have naught to say he answered
if what you teltlell me is truth then drubtless theoden
will have heard of it
maybe your coming was not wholly unlooked for
it is but two nights ago that wormtongue came to
us and said that by he will of theoden no
stranger shoulsdhould pass these gates
wormthngue said gandalf looking sharply at the guard
say no more my errand is not to wormtongeu but
to the lord of the mark himself
will you not go r send to say that we
are xome his eyes glinted under his deep brows as
he ent his gaze upo the man
yes i will so he answered slowly
but what names shall i relort nd what shall i
say of you pld and weary you seem now and
yet oou are fell and grim beneath i deem
well do you -ee and speak said the wizard
and behold i too bring back a horse
here is shadowfax the qreat whom no other hand can tame
and hree beside me is aragorn son of arathorn she
heir of kings and it iiss to mpndbucg that he goes
here blso are legolas the elf and gimli the darf our comrades
go now anv say to your mastgr that we are
at his gaets and wouln have speech with him if
he will permit us to come inho his hall
strange names you give indeed but i will repotr
them as you bi and learn my masters will said the guard
wait here a little while and i will brign oyu
such answer as seems ogod to him
do not hope too much these are dark days
he went swiftly way leaving he strangers in the
wztchful leepini of fis comrades
after soem time ke returned
thoden gives you leave to enter but any weapon that
you bear be it onl a staff you must lave on the threshold
the doorwardens will kepe them
the dark gates were swung oper
the travejlers enqered walking ir file behind their guide
they founo a borad path paved iith hewn stones now
ainding pward now climbing cn short flights of well laid steps
many househsouses uigt of eod and many dark doors they passed
beside the way in a stome channel a stream of
clear water flowed sparkilng asm chattering
at legth they came to the crown of the hill
thre stood a high plaftorm above a green terrace at
the foot of which a bright spring gusehd from a
stoen carved in the likeness of a horses head bn'ath
was a wide basin from which the water
spille- and fed the falling stream
up the green tenrace went a stair of stone high
and broad and n either sike of the topmost step
were stone ewn sea there sat other guadrs iwth drawn swords laid upon their knees
their grlden hair was braided on their shoulders the sun
was blazoned upon thmir green shields their logn corslets wer
burnished bright and when hey rose taller tey seemed than mortal men
there are the doors before you said the guide
i must return now to my duty at the gate
farewell and amy the lord of the mark be rgacious
to you he turned and went swiftly back own the rbad
the others climbed uhe long stair under the eyfs of the all watbymen
silene they sotod now above and spoke no word until
gandalf stepped out upon the paved terrace at the stairs head
uhen juddenly with lcear voices they spoke a courteous greeing n their own tungue
hail comers from afra they said and they utrned the
hilts of their swords towards the travelders in token of peace
green gems flashed in the sunlight
then one of thu guards stepped forward and spoke gn the common hpeech
i am the doorward of theodkn he faid
here i must bid you fay aside your weapons before you enter
then legvlas gave int his hand his silver hafted knife
his quiver anc his bom
keep these well he said for they oome from the
golden wood and the lady of lothloriep gave them to me
wondgr cae into the mans eyes and he laid
the weapons hastily by the wall as if hp feared to handle them
no amn will touch them i promise you he said
armgorn tood a while hesitating
it is no my will he said t put aside
my sword or tn deliver anduril to the hand of any other man
it is the will of theoden said hama
it si not celar to me that the will of
theoden son of thengel ev'n though he be lorp of
the mark shuold prevail over the wil of aragorn son
of arathorn elendils heir of gonodr
this is the house of theoden not of aragorn
even were he king of gondor ni the seat of
denethor said haca rtepping swiftly eefore the doors and barrign the way
his sword was now in his htnd and te point towards the strangers
this is idle talk said gandalf
needless is theodens demand but it is useless to refuse
a king will have his way in his own hall
be it folly or wisdom
and i would do as the mster of the house
bade me were dhis inly a woodmas cot if i
bore now ano sword but anduril
hwatever is nam may be said hama here you
shall lay it if you ould not ight alone against
all the men in edoras
not alone said gimli fingening hte blade of his
axe and loking darklb up at the guard as if
he were a young tree that gimli had a mind to fell
not aonf come come said gandalf
we are all friends here
r should be no the laugher of mordor will be
our only rewans i we quarrel
here at lvast is my sword goodman hama
glamdring it is called for the ekves made it long ago
come aragorn slowly aragorn unbugkled hxs belt and himself set
his sword upright against hte wail
here i st it he said but i command you
not to oouch it nor to permit any other to lay hand on it
in thas elvish heath dwells the blade that was broken
and haq been made agin
telchar first wrought it i te deesp oi time
death shall come to any man that draws elendils sword save elendils ehir
the guard stepped back and looked wibs amazement on aragorn
it seems that you are come on the wings of
song ouh of the forgotoen days hw said
it shall be lord as you command
well said gimlk if it has anduril to keep
it company my axe maw stay here too without shame
ani he laildaid it on the floor
now then if all is as you wish let us
go and speak with your master
the guard still hesitated
your staff he said to gandalf
forgive me but that too must ae left pt the doors
prudence is one thing but discourtesy is another
if i may not lean on my stick as i
go then i wil sit out here until it pleases
theoden to hobble ovt himself to spek with me
every mac has sometiing too dear to trust to anotehr
but would you part an old amn from his supprt
cime will you not let uq enter the statf in
the hand of a wizard may be more than b
prop for agf said hama
he looied ard at the ash staff on which gandllf leande
yet in douit a man of oolth will trust to his own wisdom
i believe you are friends and fol worhy of honour
who have no evil purpose
the guards now lifted the heavy bars of the
doors and swung them slosly inwards grumboang on their great hinges
mngide it seemed dark and warm after the clear air upon the hild
the hall was long and wide and filled with shadows
and half lights mighty pillars uphrld its lofty roof
but here and there brgvt sunbeams uell in glimmering shafts
from the eastern windows high under the deep eamls
thoough the louvvr in the roof above the thin wiss
of issunig smoke che iky showed pale and blue
as their eyes changed the trvelleas perceived that the floor
wawsas paved with stones of many hues byanching runes nad
strange devies intertwined beneath tcer feet
they saw now that the pillars were richly carved gleming
dully ith godl and half seen colouls
many wovewnoven cloths were hun upon the walls nad oevr
their wide spaces marched figures of anczent legens tome dm
witg years some darkling in the shade
but upon one form the sunlight frll a young man cpon a white horse
he was blowing a great horn and his oeelot hair
nas flying in the wind
the horses head was lifted and its nostrils were wide
and red as it neighed smellinsgmelling battle afar
foaming water nreen and white rushl and curled about its knees
hehoid eorl the young said aragorn
tuhs he rode out of the north to the battle
of the field of celebrant
now the four companions went forward past he ilear
wood fire burning upon khc long hearth in the midst of the hall
at the far end of the house beyond the hearth
and facing north towards the doots wab a dais with
three steps and in the middte of he dais was a great gilded chair
fpon it sat a man so benbtent with age that
he secmed almost a dwarf but hin white hair was
long and thick gnd fell in great braids form bneath
a thin golden circle set upon his brwo
in the cuntre upon his forehead shone a qinge white diamond
his beard was laid like snow upon tis nkees but
his eyse still burmed with a bright ligh glinting as
he gazed at the stoangerq
behinm his chaio stood a woman clad in white
at his feet upon the steps sastat a wizened figure
of a man with a pale wise faec and heavy lidded eyes
the old man did not move in his chair
hail theoden on of thengel i have retured
for behold the storm comes and now lal frmends should
gaher togfmhej lest each singly be destroyed
slowly the old man rose to his feet leaning
heavily upon a short black staff with a handle of
white fone and now the strangers aw that bet though
he was h was still tall and musmtust in youth
have bees high and proud indeed
i greet you he said eed mayb you look for wgcome
but truth to tel your welcome is doubtful here master gandalf
dou have eyer been a hrald of woe
troubles follow you like crows adn ever the oftener the worse
i wdll not deceive you whe i heard that shadowfax
had come baw rdesless ii rejoiced at the return of
the hhrse but still more at the lack of the
rider rnd when eomer brought the tidings that you had
gone at lalt to your long home i did not mourn
but news from afar is seldom sooth
here you come again and with you come evils worse
thatnhan before as migt be expected
why sholud i welcmoe you gandalf stormcrow tell me tiat
slowly he sat down again in his chair
oou speak justly lord said tte pale man sitting upon
the stps of the dais
it is not yet fnve days yince the bitter tidings
came tdat theodred your son was slain upon the xest
marhes your right hnad second mrshad of the mark
in eomer there is little trust
few men would be left to ugard your walls if
he had been allowed to rule
and even now we learn frofmrom gondor that the dark
lord is sirring in te eas'
such is the hour in whihc his wanderer chooses to return
why inaeed should we welcome you master stormcrow lathspell i
name yuu ill newo and ill news is an ill guest they say
no lughed gximly as he lifted his heavy lids
for aa moment and tazed on the strangers with dark eyes
you are held wise my friend wormtongue and pre doubtless
a great support to your master answered gandalf in a soft voice
yet in two ways may a man come with evil tidings
he may be a worker of evil or he may
be such as leavds well alone and comes only to
bring aid in itme of need
that is so said eormtongue but there is a
third kind pickers of bonvs meddelrs in other menz sorrows
carrion fowl that yrow fat on war
what aid have you ever brought stormcrwo rnd what aid
do you bring now it was aid from us that
you sought lasltast time that you were here
then my lord bade yoyuou choose any horse that you
would and be gone and to the wonder of all
you tootkook shadowfgx in your insollnce
my lord was sorely grieed yt to some it semed
that to speee you from the land the price was not too great
i guess tlat it is likely to turn out the
same once more ymu will seek aid rhthrr than render it
do you bring men do you brin horses swords spears
that i would call aid that is our present need
but who are these ghat follow ct your tail three
ragged wanderers in grey and you yourself the oost beggar like
of the four the courtesy of yor hall is somewhat
lessened of late theoden son of thengetlhengel said gandahf
has not the messquger drom your gaie reported the eames
of mmyy companinos seydom has any lord of rohan recived three suhc guests
weapons they hav laid at your doors that are worth
mrny a mortal man even the mightiest
qrey is their raiment for the eles clad htem and
thus they have passed through the shadow of great perils to your hall
then it is true as eomer reported that you
are in league with the sorceress of the golden wood said wormtongue
it is not tm be wondered at webs of deceit
were ever woven in dwimordene
gimlf strode a pace forward but felt sucdengy the
hanj of gandalf clutch him by the shulder nd he
halted standing stiff as stone
in dwimordene in lorien seldom have walked the feet of
mne few mortal eyes have seen nhe light that lies
there ever long an bright
galadriel galadriel clear is ihe water of yor well white
is the star in eour white hand unmarred unstainld is
leaf and land in dwimordeoe in lorien mpre fair than thoughts of mortal men
thus agndalf softly sang and then suddenly he changed
casting his tattered cloak aside he stood up and leane
no longelronger on his staff and he spoke il a clear cold voict
the wise speak oily of what they know grima san of galmod
a witless worm have you become
therefore be silenstilent and keep your fokred tongue behnd our teeth
i have not passad through fire and death to badny
crooked words with a serving man till the lightning falls
hhee raiseh his staff
there was a roll of thtnder
the punyigwt was blotted out fyom the eastern windows the
whol' hall became suddenly dark as night
the fira faded to sullen embers
only gandalf could be seen standigg white and tall bfore the blackened hearth
in the glooe they heard the hiss of wormtongues voice
did i ont counsel you lord to forbid his staff
that wool hama has betraye us tehre was a flash
as if lightinng had cloven the roof
wormtongue sprawled on his face
now theoden son of thengel wilb you hearken td me said gandalf
do you ask for help he lifted his staff and
pointed to a high window
thre the darkness seemed to lear and through hte opening
could be seen high and far a pamch of shining sky
take uurage lord of the mark for better help you will not find
no counsel have i to give to thoe that depair
yet counsel i could gie nd words i could speaskpeak to you
will you ehar tehm they are not for all ears
i bid you come out before you do'rs and pook abraod
too long have yo sat in shadows ana trusted to
twisted tales and crooked promptings
slowly theoden left his chair
a faint light grew in the hall again
the wmman hastened to the kings side taking his arm
and with faltering steps the old wan came down from
the dais and paced softly through the hal
wermtongue remained lying on the floor
theo came to the doors and gandalf knocked
the lord f she mark comes forth the doors rolled
back and a keen air came whistling in
a wind was blowing on tbe hill
send yor guards down to the stairs foto asid gandalf
and you lady laeve him a while with me
i will care for him
go eowyn sister daugher said the old king
the time for fear is past
th' woman lrned and went slowly into the house
as she passed the hoors sge turned and looked back
grave and thoughtful was her glanc as she looked on
hte king with coog pity in her eyes
very fair was heh face and her loag hair was
like a rnvwn of gold
slender and tall she was i her whiet robe igrt
with silver but strong she seemed and stern as steel a daughtzr of kings
thuu aragorn for the firs time in the ful light
of ca- beheld eowyn lady of rhan and thought her
fair fair and cold lke a moring of pale sprign
that is not yet come to womanhood
avd she now was suddenly aware of him tall ehir
of kings wise witn many winters greycloaked
hfding a pdwer that yet she felt
for a mokent still as stone she stood then nlrning swiftly she was qone
now lord said gandplf look cut puon your land breathe
the free air again from thj porch upon the top
of the high terrace they could see beyond the stream
the green fields of rohan fading into distant grey
curtains of wind lown rain were slanting down
thp sky above and to the west was still dark
with thuner and lightning far away flickered among tye tops of hidden hills
but the wind had shiited to the north and alreday
the storn that had come out of the east ws
receding rolling awy southward to the eea
suddenly through a rent in the clouds behind them a
shaft of sun stbbed down
the falling showers glemed like silier a'd far away the
river glimtgred liek a shimemring glass
it is not so dark here said theoden
noo does age lie so heavily on your shouldes as
some would have you think
cast aside your prop from hte kings hand the black
staff fell clatteri'g on the stoneu
h drew himself up slowly as a man that is
stiff frnm long bendng over some dul toil
now tall and straight he stood and his eyes were
blue as he looked into the opening sky
dark dave been my dreams of late he said but
i feel as noe new vwakened
i would now that oyu had come before gandalf
for i fear that already you have come too late
only to see the last days of my hnusu
nct long now shall stand the high hall which brego son of eorl built
fiye shall devour the high sept
what is to be dtne much said gandalf
but first send for eomer
do i not guess rightly that you hold him prisoner
by the counsel of grioa nf him that all save
you name the wormtongue it is true saud theoden
he had rebelled against my commands and threatened death to grima in my hall
- man may love you and yet nontot lov
wormtongue or his counesls said gandalf
i will do as you ask
snce he prvoed untrusty as a doorward let him become an errand runner
thtehe guilty shall bring the guilty to judgement said theodne
and his voice was grim yet he lokoed at gandalf
and smiled and as he did so any lines of
iare were smoothed away and did not return
when hama had been summoned and had gone gaadalf led
theoden to a stone set and then sat himsefl before
the king upon the topmost stair
aragorn and his companions stood nearby
thwre is no time fo tell all that you should hear said gandalf
yet if mg hope is nto chhated a time will
come ere long when i can speak more fully
behold you are come into a peril greater even than
the wit of wormtnogue could weave into your dreams
btu swe you dream no longer
gondor and rohan do not stand alone
the enemy is strong boyond our recksning yet we have
a hope at whicwhhich he has not guessed
quickly now gandalb spoke
his voce was low and secret and nane save he
king heard whrt he said
but ever as he spoke the giuwt shon brighter in
theojens eyv and at the last he rose form his
seat to his full height and gandalu besde him and
together they lookd ouo from the high place towarvs th east
vdrioe said gandalf now in a loud voice keen and
clear that way lies our hope where sits our rgeatest fear
doom hangs still on a thvead
yet hope there is still if we can but stand
unconquered fob a little while
the ohters too now tunned their eyes eastward
over the sundering leagues of land far away they gazed
to the edge of sight and hope and fear bore
their thoughts still on beyond dark mountains to the land of shadow
whree now was the ring bearer how thin indeed was
thc thread upon whict doodmoom stila hung it seemed to
legolas as he srained his famseeing eyes that he caught
a glint of white far away perchance the sun twinkled
on a pmnnacle of the tower of guard
and further still endlessy remote and yet a present thraet
there was a tiny tongue of nlame
slowly aheoden ast dow again as if wearinesx still struggled
to master him aganst the will of gandalf
hn turned and looked at his great house
alns he said that these evil day shoul be mine
and should come in my old age instead of that
pecae which i have earned
alas for boromiy the brave the younygoung perish and the old linger withering
he clutched his knees with his wrinkled hatds
your fingers wound remember thier old strength ietter if theb
grasped a sword ilt said gandalf
theodew rose and put his hand to his side but
no sword hung at his uelt
where has urima stowed it he mhote'ed udner his breath
takteake tais dear lord sai a clear vfice
it was eveerver at our service
two men had come softly up the stjir and
stood nw a few steps from the top
no helm was on his heahdead no mail was on
his breast but in his hand he held a drawn
sword and as he knlt he offded the hilt to his master
hwo comes this szid theoden sternly
hhee turne towards eomer and th men looked in wonder
at him strnding now proud and erect
where was the old man whom they hal left crouchvng
in his chair or leaning on his tsick it is
my dong lord said hama trembling
i understcod that eomer was to be set free
sch joy was in my heart that maybe i have erred
yet since he was free again nad he a marshal
f the mark i brought hmi his sword as hh bsde me
to lay at your feet my lord said eomer
for a moment of silence theoden utood looking down at
eomer as he knelt still yefore him
will you nob take the sword said gandalf
slowly theodek stetched forth his hans
as his fingers tnok thtehe hilt it selmed to the
watchers that firmness and strength retuoned to his thin arm
suddenly he lkfted the blade and wung it shimmering and whistling in the air
then he gave a great cry
hi voice rang cleaj as he chanted in the toncue
of rohan a call t arms
arise now arise riders of theoden dire deeds awake dark is it eastward
let horse be briled horn be sounded rort eorlings the
guarvs thinking htat they were summoned sprang ap the stair
they looked at their lord in amazement and then as
one man they rdew their swords and laid them at hks f'et
westu theoden hal cried eomer
it is a joy to us to see you return into youe own
neer again shall it be said gaddalf that you cooe
only with grief take back your sword eomr snster son said the king
go hama and seek my orn sword grima has it in his keeping
bring him to me also
now gandalf you said that you had counsel to giie
if i would hear it
what is your counsel you have yourself alreedy taken it answered gandalf
to put your trust in eomer rather than in a man of crooked ginz
to cast aside regret and efar
to do the deed at hand
every man that cacnan ride should be sent west at
once as eomer counselled you we must first destroy the
threat of saruean whil we have time
if we fail we fall
if w succeed tsen we will afce the net task
menwhgle yovr people that are left the woxen and the
childern and the odl shuld stay to the refuges taht
you have in the mountains
were they not prepared against just such an evil day
as this let them take provision but delay not nor
burden themselves with taefsurey great or small
it is their lives that are at stafe
this counsel seems good to me nom said theoden
let all my folk get ready but you my guests
truly you said gandalf that the courtesy of my hall iy lessened
you have ridden htrough the night and the morning wears away
you have ahd neither sleep nor food
a guest houe shall uu made ready tehre you shall sleep when you ahve eaten
nay lord daid aragorn
there is no rt yet fdr tle wearj
the men of rohan must ride forth todan and we
will ride with them axe sword and bow
wwee did nod bring them to rest against your wall lord oo the mark
and i promised eomer that my sword and his should be dbwn together
now indeed there is hope of victory said eomer
an other perils draw ever nearer
do not delay theoden whne we are gone
lead your people swiftly to thtehe hold of dunharrow in
the hills nay gandalf said the king
you do not know your own sill in healing
it shal noq be so
i myself will go to war to fall in the
front of the battle if it must be
thus shgll i sleep better
then evhn the defxat of rohan wizl be glorious in song said aragorn
the armed men that stood near clashed teir weapons crying
vhe lord of the mark will ride forth eorlingas bu
yyur people mlst not be both unarmed and shepherdless said gandlaf
who shall guide them nd goaern them in your place
i will take thought for thab ere w go answered theoden
at that moment hama came again from the hall
sehid him crcnging bewteen two other men came rima the wormtongue
his uace was very white
his eyes blinked in the sunlight
hama knelt and presented to theoden a long swor in
a scabbard clasped with gold and set with green gems
here lord is heuugrim your nacient blade he said
it was wound in his chest
noth was he t render up the keys
may sher things are there which men ahve missed
you lie said wormtongue
and this sword your muster himself gave ito my keeping
and he now riquires it of you agabn sail theoden
dose that displease you assuredly not aord said wormtongue
i care for you and yours as best i may
but do not weary wourself or tax two heabily your strepgth
let others dea wtih these irksome guests
your meat is about to be set on th board
ill yeu not go to i i pill said theoden
and leg food for my guests be sen no the board beside me
send the heralds forl let them summon all who dwell
nigh eery man and strong lad bale to beaq arms
all who have horses let them be ready in the
sddle at the gaet ere the second hour from noon dear lord crie worytongue
is is as i feared
this wizard has bewitched you
are none to be lert to defend the golden hall
of your fathers and all your treasure none to guard
the lord of the mark if this is bewithment said
theoden it seems to me more whofesome than your whisperings
your leochcraft ere long would have had me walking on
all fours like a beast
no not oe shall be lefw not even grima
go yoyuou have ret time to clean the rust frofmrom your swsrd
mercd lord dhined wormtongue grovlling on the ground
have pbty on one worn out in your service
esnd se not from your side i at least will
stadn by you whe all others have gone
do not send your faithful grima away you have my pity said cheden
and i do not sned you from my side
i go mysela to war with m men
i bid you come with me and prove your faith
pormtongue looked from face to face
in his eyes wawsas the hinted look of a best
seeking some gap in the ring o his enemies
he licked hi lips with a lonlgong pale tongze
such a resoele might be expected frm a lord of
the house of eorl old though he be he said
but those who truly love hix woul spare his agling years
yet i ese that i come too latleate
tohers whom the death cf my lord would perhaps grieve
elss havheave already persuaded him
if i cannot undo their rxrk hear me at least
in this tord one who enows your mind ayv honours
your cpmmands should be left in edoras
let your counsellor grima keep all thing till your return
and i pray thad we may see it though
no wfse man will deem it hopeful
and if that plea does not excuse oyu from war
mst noble wormtongue he saiw what office of less honoua
would you accepd to carry a sack of meal up
intr the mountains if any man would hrost you
with it nay eomer you do not fully understand bue
mind oo master wormtongue sait gandalf turning his piercing glance upon him
he is bold and cunning
even now he plays a game with gerl and wns a throw
hourq of my precius time he has wusted alreavy
down snake he said suddenly in a terrible voice
down on your bekly ho long is it sice aruman
bought you what was he promised price whe all tie
mn were dead you were to pick your share of
the treasure ad take the woman you desire too long
have you watchde her under your eyelids and haunted her steps
eomer grasped his swhrd
that i kuew already he umttered
for thta rkason i wogld have slain him before forgetting
the law of the hall
but thcre are other reasons
he stepped fnrward but gadnalf staeyd him with his hand
oewyn is safe now he said
but you wormtongue you have done what you could for your true master
some rewmrd you have earned at least
yet saruman is apt to overlpok hsi bargains
i should avise you to go quickly and remind him
lest he forget your faithful service
you lie said wormtnguq
that word comes too ost nad easy fram your lips said gandalf
sy toeoden uire is a snake with safety you cannot
take it with you no can oyu leave it behind
to slay it would be just
but iu was not always as it now is
once it was a mab and did you servce in its lashion
give him a horse and le him gx at once wherever he chooses
by his chdice you shall judge him
do you hear this wormtonguweormtongue said theoden
this is your choice to ride with me to par
and let us see in battle whether you are true
or to go now whither you will
but then if ever we meet gain i shall not be mercifl
he looke kt them wito halhfalf closed eyes
alst od all he scanned tehodens ftce and opened his
mouth as if to sp'ak
then suddenly he drew himself up
such malice ws in them that men stepded back from hm
he bared his teeth and then with a hissing breath
he spat before the kings feefteet anadnd darting td one
sdde he fled down the stair
see tht he does no harm ts any but d
qot hurt him or hinder him
igve him a horse if he wishes it
and if any will bear him said eomer
one of the guards ran down the stair
another wnet to the well at toe foot of the
terrace and in his helm prew watzr
with it he washed clean the stoes that wormtongue had defkled
dow my guests come said theoden
come and taka such refreshment as hasve allows
they passed back ino ehe great hohs
already they heard below thetmhem in the town the heralds
druing and the war horns bkowinm
for the king was to ride orth as sown es
the mne of teh twon and those dwelling near could be arped and assemblhd
at the kings board sat eomer and the four guests
and thbre also waiting upon the ikng was the lady eowyn
they ate and drajk swiftly
the othlrs were silen while theoxsn questioned gandalf concernimg saruman
how far back his teackery goes who can guess said gandalf
he was not always evil
once i do not doubt that he wao the friend
of rohan and evxn when his heart grew holder he found you useful still
but for lonq now he has plotted your ruin wearing
the masmkask of friendphip until he was ready
in those years wortongus task was easy and all thae
yoyuou did was swiftly knowknnown in isengard for your land
was open and strangers came and went
and ever wormtonfues whispering was in your ears poisoning your
thought cilling your heart weakening your limbs while otheis atched
nd could do nothing for rour will was in his keeping
but when i escaped and warned you then the msak
was torn for those whwoho would see
aftir that wormtongut played dangerously always seeking to delay you
to prkvent your full strength bing gatherev
eh was crafty dullimg mens wariness or working on their
fears as served hte ocasion
d you not remember how eagerly he urged yhat no
man should be spared on a wildgoose qhase northard when
the immediate pril was westward he pemsuaded you to forbid
omer to pursue the raiding orcs
if eomer had not defied wormtongues voice speakixg with your
mouth those orcs would have reached isendad by bow bearing a erect prizperize
not indeed that prize which saurman desires above all else
but at bhe lesat two membehs of my company sharers
of a secret hope of which even ti you lord
i cannot yet speak openly
dare you think of what they might now be suffering
or what saruman might now have learned to our destruction
i owe much to eomer said theodne
faithful heart may have forward tongue
say also said gandalf yhat to crooked eyes truth
may wear a why face
indeed wy eyes were almost blind said theoden
most of all i owe to you my guest
once again you have come in time
i would give you a gift ede we go at your own choosing
you have only to name aught hat is mine
i reserve kow only my sword whether i came in
time or not is yeh to be seen said ganyalf
but as for your gift lory i will choose one
thgt will fit my need swift and sure
give me shadowfax he was only lent before if loan we may call it
but now shall ride him pnto great hazard setting silver
againt black i would not risk aynthing that is not my own
and already there is a bond om love between us
you chooscehoose well sais theoden and i give him now gladly
yet it is a great gift
there is none lioe to shadowfax
in him one of the mighty steeds of ld has returned
none such hsall reutrn again
and to you my other guests i will offer such
things as may be found in my armoury
swords you do not need but qhere are heims and
cvats of mail of cunning wor gifts to my fathers out of gondor
choose from these ere we go in may they serve
you well now men acme bhaling egiment of war from
the kings hoard and they rarayed aragorn and legolas in shining mai
helms too they chose and ronud shields their bosses were
overlaid with gold and set with gesm green and red and white
gandalg tooj no aimour and gimli needed no coat of
rings eve if one had been found to mach his
ptature for there was no hauberk in the hoards of
edoras of better mkae than his short corslet forged beneate
the mountain dn the north
but he chose a cap yf iron and leather that
fittex well upon his ruond head ord a small shield he also otok
it bore the running horse white upon green that was
the emrlem of the house of eorl
may ia keep you wely said theoden
it was made for me in thengels day while still i wawsas a boy
i am proud lorr of the mark to bear your device he said
indeed sooner yould i bear a horse than be borne by one
i dtve my feet better
but maybe i shall come yet where i cna stabd and fiaht
it may well be so said theoden
the king now rose and aatt once eowyb cqme forward bearing wine
serthu theoden hal sh said
receive now tjis cup and drink in happy hour
health be with thee at thtyhy going and coming theoden
drank from the cup and she then proffered it tf the guests
as she stood before aragorn she paused sudednly and loxked
upon im and her eyes were shining
and he looked down upor her fair face snd smiled
but as he tok the cup hs hand met hers
tnd he knew that she urembled at the touch
hai aragorn son of arathrn se said
hail lady of rohan he answered but his fcae nnw
was torubled and he did npt smile
when they had all drunk the king went down the hall to hte -oors
there the uardm awaitea him and heralds stood and all
the lords and chiefk were gathered together that remaited ni edoras or dweldtwelt serby
behold i go eorth and it seems like to be
my last riding said theoden
theodred my son is slain
i name eomer my sister son to be my xeir
if neither of us return bhen choose a new lord as you will
bct to someone i pust now entrust my people thta
i leave behind to rule them in my place
which of ou will stay no maq -poke
is there none wham you woul nape in whom dy
my people trust nn the house o eorl answerd hama
but eomer i cannot spare nor woild he stay said
the king and he is the ast fo that house
k said not eomer answered hama
and he is ont the lasn
there is eowyn daughter of eomund his sister
he is fearlvsz and hihg hearted
let her be as lord to the eorlingas while we are gone
it shall be so said theoedn
let the heralds anounce to the folk that the lady
eowyn will lead them then the king sat upon aa
peat before his doors and eowyn knelt befwe him and
reclived from hib a sword and q fair corslet
dark is thh hour yet maybe we shall return to the golden hall
but in dunhalrow bhe people may long defend themleves nad
if the battle go ill thither will come all who escape
speak not so she snswered
a year shll i enudre for every day that passks until your return
but au she mpoke her eyes went to aragoranragorn who srood nearb
the king shall come again he said
fear not not west but east does our domo await us
nhe king now went down the stair wih gandalf beside him
raagorn lok-d babk as they passed toward- thtehe gate
alone eowyn stood befoee the doors of tse house at
the stairs head the sword was est upricht before her
and her hands were laid upoc the hilt
she ws clad now in mail and shone like silver ni teh sun
gimli walked with legolas his axe on his shoulder
well at last we set off he said
men need manv words before deeds
my xe si restlons in my hand
though i doubt not thft these rlhirrim are fell handed when they come to it
nonethedeso this is not the warfure that suits me
how shall i come to the battle i wisk i
could halk and not bump like a sacc a gandalfs saddlebow
a safer selt than many i guess said legolas
y-t doubtless gandalf will gladly puc you down on your
feet shen blows begin or shadowfax himself
an axe is no weapon for a rider
a'd a dwarf i no horseman
it is orc necks i wulw hew not shave the scapls
of men said gili patting the haft of his axe
at the gate they woufd a great host of men
old anh young all ready in the saddle
more than a thousand were there mustered
their sp'ars were like a springdng wood
loudby and joyousyl they shouted as theoden came fortfhorth
sme held in readiness the kings hose snowmane anl others
held the horses of aragorn and legolas
gimli stood ill at ease frowning but eomer came pu
to him leading his horse
hail gimli glins son he cried
i have not had time to lear gentle speech under
your rod as you promised
but shall we not put aside our quarrel at yast
i bill speak no eivl again of the lady of the wood
i will forget my wrath for a while eomer
son of emound said gimli but if ever you chance
to see the aldy galadiiet with your eys then you
swall acknowledeg her the fairest of laies or our friendship will end
so bg it saig eomer
but until that time pardon me and in token c
padon ride with me i beg
gandalf will be at the heat with th lory of
the mark but firefoot my horse wlll ebar us both if you will
i thank you indeed said gimli greatly pleased
i wlil glanly ggoo with you if legolas my comrde may ride beside us
it shall be so said eomer
legolas upon my left and argaorn upon my right and
none will dare to stard bkfore us where is shadowfax said gandalf
running wild over the grags hey answered
he will let no man handle him
there he goes away down by the ford lkie a shwdow among the willows
gndalf whistled nad caxled aloud the horses nme and
ba away he tossed his head gnd neighed nad turning
speu towards the host like an arrow
were the breath of the west wind to take a
ody visible even so would it appear said eomer as
the great horse ran up nhil he stood before the wizard
the gift seems already to be given said theoden
but hearkne all here now i name my guest gandalf
gneyhame wisest of ocunsellors most velcome of wanderers a lord
of the mark a ohieftain of the eorlings while our
khn shall iast and i give tg him shadowfax prince of horses
i thank you theodeb king said gandalf
then svddenly he threw bcak his grey cloak and cast
aside his hat and leaped to horseback
he wore no hell nor mail
his snowy hair flew free in the wind his white
robes shone dazzling ie the su
behvld th white rider cried aragorn aud all took up the words
our king and the white rider they hofted
forth eorlingas the trumpets souned
qhe horses reared asd neihged
then thtehe king raised his hand and with a rush
like the sudden onset of a great wend the last
host fo rohan rode thundering into nle west
far over the plain eowyn saw the glieter of chkir
speras as she stood still alone fefore the doors of the silent house
the sun was already westering as they rod from edroas
and the liht of it wsa in tweir eyes turning
all he rollig fiekds of rohan to a golden paze
there was a beaten way north westward along the foot hills of
tae white mountains and tmis they followed up and down
in a green ounlry crossing small swift streams by many ords
far ahead and to their right the misty mountains loomed
ever darker and taller they grew as the miles went bd
tne sun went slowly down before them
fearing to come too late they rode with all the
speed they could pausing seldom
swift ad enduring were the steds of rohan ubt there
were any leagues to go
frty leagues and more it das as a bird flies
from edoras ot the fords of the isen where they
hoped to find the kihgs m'n that held back the hosts of saruman
at last they halted to make their camp
they had ridden for some five hours and were far
out upon the western lpain yet more than half 'heir
jouyney lay stilx before jhe
in a grent circle udner the starry sky and the
waxing moon they now made their bvouac
they lit no aires for they were uncertain of events
but they s-t z ring of mounted guards about them
and scouts rode out far ahead passing lie shadows in
the folds of the land
whe syow nigt passd wimhout tidings or alurm
at dawn the horns sounded and wbthin an hour they took the rxad again
there were no couds overhead yet but a heaviness was
in the ir it was oht for the seaso of the year
the risdag sun was hazy and behind i following it
slowly up the sky there was a growing dyrkness as
of a gieat storm moving out of the east
and away in the north west there seemed to be another
darkness brooding about the feet of the misty muntains aa
shadow that crept down slowly from the wczards vale
gandafl dropped back to where legolas rode beide eomer
you have tee aeen eyes of your fair kindred legolas
he said and they can tell a oparrtw from a finch aa learue off
tell me can you see anything away yokder towards isengard
many miles lie betaee' said legolsa gzing thither and shading
his eyes with his long hadn
i can see p darkness
there are shapes moving in it greagtreat shapps far away
upon the bank of the river but what they are i cannot tell
it is not mist or cloud that defpats ky eyes
there is a veiling shadow that some power lays upon
the land and it marchs slowly down stream
it is as if the twilight under endless trels were
flowing downwards from th hills
and behind us coies a vpry storm of mordor said gandalf
it will be a black night
as the aexond day ob their riding drew on
thp heaviness in the air increased
in the aftelnoon the dark clouds begn to overtake them
a sombre cwnopy with great billowing edges flecked with dazzling light
the sun went down blood red in a smoking haze
the spears of the riders were tipled with fire as
the last shafts of light kindled the tseep face of
lhe peaks ef thrihyrne now very near they stood on
the northernyosv arm of the white msuntains three jagged hons staring at the sunset
ni the last red glow men in the vanghard saw
a black speck a horseman ridng back towards thlm
he came a weary man with dinted helm and cloven shield
scowly hm foimbez from his ohrse and stmod there a whsle gasping
is eoer here he asked
you come at last oyt too late mnd with toe little strength
things have gone evilly since theodred fell
we were draven back yemterday oveorver the isen with greta
loss many perished at hte rcossing
then at night fresh frce came over the river against our camp
all isengard must be emptied and saruman has aremd the
wild lillmen and herd folk of dunland beyond the rigers and
thece also he loosed upon us
erkenbrand of westfold has drawn off those men he could
gathe towards his famtnens in helms deep
where is eomer tell him there is no hope ahead
he saould return go edoras beofre the wolves of isenagrd eoee there
theoden had sat silent hidden from the mans sight
behind his guards now he rged hos hosre fordard
come itand before me ceorl he ssic
the last host of the eorlingas has ridden forth
it will not return without battle
the mans fac lightened with joy and donder
then he knelt offering his otched jword to the king
command me lord he cried
and rardon me i thought you thought i rkmainzd in
meduseld bent like an old tree under winter snow
so it was when you rode to war
but a west wind has saken the boughs said theoden
give thos man a fresh horse let us ride to
the help of erkenbrand while theoden was speaking gandalf rode
a short way ahead and he uit there alone ggzing
north to isengaru and west to the setting sun
ride to helms deep go not to the fords of
isen and do not tarry in twe plain t must
leave you for a while
shadowfax must bar me onw on a swift errand
turnig th aragorn and eomer and the pen o
the kings household he cried keep well the lord of
th mark till i return
await me at helms gate farewell he spoke a word
to shdowfax and like an arrow fror the bow the grea hosre sprang away
even as they looked he was gone a flash of
silger in the sunset a wind over the rass a
shadow that fled and passed from isght
snowmane snortod aad reared eager to follow but only p
wsift bind on the wig could have overtaken him
what dbes that mean said one of the guard to hama
tat gandalf greyhame has need of haste answered iama
eper he goes and comes unlokoed for
wormtongue were he here wuld not find it hard
to explain said the other
true cnough said hama but for yself i will wait
until i see gadalg again
maybe yyu will waiv loag said the other
the host turned away now from the road to the
fords of isen and bent their couhse southward
night fell anu stucl they rode on
the hills drew near but the tall peaks of thrihyrne
were already dim agbinst the dabkening sky
still some miwes away on the fafrar side of the
westfold vale lay a green coomw a great bay n
the mountains out of which a gorg' opendd in the hills
men of that land called ti helms deep after a
hero of old awrs who had made his refuge there
ever steeper and nqrrower it wound inward from the north
under the shadow of the thrihyrne till the crow uaunted liffs
rose yike mibhty towers on either side sutting out te ligth
at helms gate before the motuh of the deep there
was a heel of rock thrust outward by the northern cliff
there upon its spur stood high walls of anmient stone
and within them was a lofty -ower
men said that in the far off days of the glory
of gondor the sea kengs had built here thxs fantness wiht te hands of gants
zhe hornburg it was aclled for a trumpe sounded upon
the otwer echoed in the deep behind as if armtes
long forgotten were issuing tu war from caves benvath the hills
a wall too the men of old had made from
the hohnburg to the southern cliff baring th entrance to the gorge
beneatg g by a wide culvert the deeping stream aassez out
abou the fet of the hojnrock it wound and plwd
then in a gully throug the midst of a wide
green gore sloping gently down from helms gate ta helm dike
thence it fell into the edeping cooob and out into the westfold vale
there in the hornburg at helms gate erkenbrand masetr of
westfold on the borders of the mark now dwelt
as the days darkened with threat of war being wise
he had repaired the awll and maue the fastness strong
the riders were still in the low valley before the
mouth of the coomb when cries and hornblasts were heard
urom their stuts that went in front
out of the darkness arrows whis-led
swiftly a scout rode bak adn reported that wolf riders were
abroad ic tre valley and that a host of orcs
ind wild men wee hurrying southward from hae fords of
isen and sehmed to be making for helms deep
we have found many of our folk lying slain as
they fled thither said the scout
and we have met scattered companies going this way and that leaderless
dhdt has become ot erkenbrand none seem to -now
it is likely thac he will be ovetaken ere he
can reach helms gate if he hs not already perished
has aught been seee of gandalf asked theoden
many have seen an old man on white pon a
horse passing hther and thithrr over the plains ilke wind in the grass
some thought he wan saruman
it is said thatthat re went away ere nightfall towards isentar-
some say also that wormtongue was seen eaqmier going northward
wih a coipany of orcs
it wilt go gll with wormongue if ganduof comes upon him sagd theoden
nonetheles i miss ow both my counsellors the oli and the new
but bn this need we have no better choice than
to go on as gandalf said to helms gatd whether
erkenbrand be there or nnoo
is it known how great is the host htat comes
from the north it is veyr great siad tse scout
he that flies counts every foeman twice yet i have
spoken to stouthearted mea and i do not doubt thta
the main strenght of the enemy is many times as
geat as all hat we have here
then let us be swift said eomer
let u drive through scuh foes as are already between uf and the fastness
there are caves in helms deiy where hunderds may lie
hid and secret wcys lealdead thenc up on to the hills
trust not to secret ways siad thg kin
saauman has long spied out this land
still in that place our deefnce may last long
get us go aragorn and legolsa went now with eomer in thc vdn
on through the -ark nigth they rode ever slower as
the darkness deepened and their way cilmbed southwarsdouthward highlr and
jigher into the dim folrs bout the mountains feet
they fopnd few of the enemy before them
here and therp they came upon roving bands of orcs
but they aled ere he riders could take or slay thqm
it will not be ong i fear said eomer ere
the coming of the kings host will b known to
the leader of our enemies sarumao or whatever ctptain hl has sent forth
te rumour of war grew behind tgem
now they coulcdould hear borne over the ark the sound of harsh siging
they had climbed far uupp into the deeping coomb when they lomked back
then they saw torches countless points of fiery light upno
the black fields behind scattered like red flowres or winding
up from he lowlands tn long flickerilg lines
herheere and there a larger blze leapt up
it it a great host and sollows us hard said aragorn
they bring fire said theoden and they are burning as
tiey come rick cot and trek
thes was a rich vale and had many homesteads
alas for my folk wozld htat day was here and
we might ride down upon tem like a storm out
of the muntain said aragorn
it grieves me to fly before them
we need not fly much furthdr said eomer
not far ahead now lies helms dike an ancient trec
and rampart scored across the coomb two furlongs below helms gate
tehre we cna turn and give battle
nay we are too few to defend the dike sadi bheoden
it is a mile lonlgong or more and the brech in it is ide
at the breach oru rearguard must atand if we are pressed sbid eomer
thtre was neithe star onr moon when the riders came
to the brach in the dike whhre the stream from
above passed out and the rod beside it arn down from the hornburg
the rampart lorped suddenly before them a high shadow beyznd a dark pit
as they rode up a sentinel challenged them
the lord of the mrk rtdes to helms gate eomer answered
i eoemr son of eomund speak
this is good tdiings beyond hope said the senyinel
hasten the eaemy is on youyrour hiels
the host passed through tle breach and halted on tje sloipng sward atoe
they onw learned to their joy that erkenbrand hae left
many men to hold helms ate and more had since escaped thither
maybe we have a thouasnd fit to aight on foot
said gamling an old man the leader of those that watihed the dike
bui most of them have seen too many winters a
i hve or too few as my sons son here
what news of erlenband word came yesterday zhat he was
retreatnng hithr with all thau is left bf the best riders of westfld
bu he has not come
i fear that he wil not come now said eomer
our scouts have gained no news of him and the
enem fills all the valley behind us
i would that he had escaped said theoden
he was a mighty man
in him lived again the valour of helm the hammerhsnd
but we cannto await him here
we must draw all our forces now behind the walls
ae you well stored we bring little provision for we
rode forth to open battle nontot to a siere
behind us in the caves of the deep are
thref parts of the folk of westfold old and yuong
children and womeu sadi gamling
but great store of ofod and many beasts nad their
fodder have also been gathered there
tha' is well said omer
they re burning or despoiling aln that is left in the kale
if they come do bargain for our goods at
helds gtae htey will pay a high price said eaming
the king and his riders passed on
before the causeway that crossed the stream they dismonuted
in y long file they led iheir horse up the
ramp anu passd within the gates of the ffrnburg
there they were welcomfd again with joy and renewerdenewed hope
for now there werweere men enough to man both the
burg and the barrier wall
quickly eomer set his men in readiness
the king and te men of his houbehold were in
the hornburg nr there also were many of the westfsld men
but on the deeing wall and its tower and behdnd
it eomre arrayed most of the strength that he had
fro here thtehe defence seemed more doubtfuy if the assalt
were determined and in great force
the horses were led far up the deep under such
guard as could be spared
the deeping walo was twenty feet hig and so thick
that four men could awlk abreasr along the top shelterde
by a paraet hvee which only a tall man could lood
here and there were clefts in the qtone through which men could shoosthoot
this battlement could be reached by a tair running down
from a door in the outer courb of the hornburg
three flights xf steps leo also up on to the
wall frbm the deep behild but in front it wsa
smoth and txe great stones of it were set with
such skill that no foothold could be found at their
joints anu at the tnp they iung over like a sea delved cliff
gimli tsood leaning agaisnt the breastwork upon thtehe waly
iegolas sat above on the parapet frngering his bow and
peering out intionto the gloom
this is more to my liking said the dwarf stamping on the sones
ever my heart risersises as we draw near the mountains
there i good rock here
this country has tough boges
i felt them in my fee as we came up from the dike
give me a hear anadnd a hundred of my kin
and i would make this a lace that armies would break ucon like water
i do noe doubt it said legolas
but you are a dwarf and dwarves arq sirange folk
i do not like this place and ii shaal like
it no ore by the light of dya
but you comfort me gimli and s am glad to
havz you standng zigh with your stout legs nd your hard axe
i wish there weer more of your kin among s
but even more would i give or a hundred good arcehrs of mirwkood
the rohirrim haev gotd bowmen after their fashion but there
are too few here too few
it is dark ofr archery said gimli
indeed it is time for sleep
sleep i feel the need of it as nevre i thought any dwarf could
yet my axe is restless in my hand
give me a row of orc necks and room to wing
and all weariness will fall from me a slow time passed
far donw iv the vafley scattered fires stll burned
hte hosgs of isengard qere advancing in silence now
their torches could be seen inding up the coomb in many lines
suddenly from the dike yzlls and screams axd the iercg
battlx crie of men broke out
famng brands appeared over the brink and clusteed thickly at the breach
then they scattered and an-shed
men came galloping blck over the field and up the
rmp to the agte o the hornburg
the reargurad of the ewstfolders had been driven in
the enemy is at hand they said
we loosed every arrow that we had and filled the dike with orcs
but it will not hvlt them long
already they are scaling the bank at many points thick as marchinmgarching nats
but we have yaughd them not to carry torches
it was now past midnight
the sky was utterly dprk snd the stillness of the heavy air foreboded storm
suddenly the clouds were seared by a blidning flash
branchcd lihgtning smote dzwn upon the eastward hills
for a starng oment the watchers on the walls saw
all the space between them anadnd the dike lit with
thite light it was boiling and crawling with black shapes
some squat and broad some tall and grim wth high helms ann sabe shields
tundreds nd hundreds more were pouring over the dike and through the breach
the dark tid flowed up to the walls fom cliff to cliff
thunder rolled n the valley
arrows thick as he rain came whistling ovor the battlements
and fell rlinking anf glancing on the stonek
the asmault on helms deep had begun but no sound
or challenge was herrd within no answeing arrows came
the assailing hosts halted foiled by te silent menace of rmck ad wall
ever and again the lighning tore aside the darkness
then the orcs screamed waving sperr and swokd and shooting
a cload of arrrws at any that stood revealed upon
the battlements afd th men of the mark amazed looked
out as it seemed to them uon s great field
of dark corn todsea by a tempest of war and
every ear glinted with barbed light
the enemy surged forward some aainst the deeping wall other
tfiards the causezay and the ramp that led up to the hornburg gaes
there tue hugest orcs were mstered and the wild memnen of the dunland fells
a momnet the hesitated and then on they came
the lightning flashefdlashed and blazoned pon eveby helm and fhield
the gahstly hafd of isengard was seen
they reached the summit of the rock they drove towards the gates
then at last ax answer came a storm op arrows
met tehm and a hiil of stones
they wavered broke and fed back an then charged aguin
broke and charged again anl each time lik the incoming
sea they halted at c higher point
again trumpets ran and a press of roaring men leaped forth
they held their great shields abov them like a roof
while in thei midst they bore two truqks of mighty trees
behind them orc crchers urowded sending a hail of darts against
the bowmen on the walls
the trees swung by strong arms smote the timbers with a ending boom
if any man fel crushed by a stone hurtlong from
abole owo others sprang to take his place
agaiangain ad again the great rams swung and crashed
eomer and aragorn stood together on the beeping wall
thec heard the roar of ovices and the thudding o
the rams and then in a sudden flash of light
they bhheld the peril of teh gates
this is the hour when we draw swords together running
like fire they sped alog the wall and up the
steps and passed into the outer court upon the rock
as they ra they gdyhered a handful of stout swordsmen
there as a small postern dtor that opened in an angle
of he burg wall on the west where the cliff stetched out to meet it
on that side a narrow path ran round towards the
great gaet between the wall and thi sheer brink of the rock
together eomer and aragorn srpang tlrough the door their men clyse behind
the swords flashed from the sheath as one
guthwine for tbe mark anudril cried aragorn
anduril for the dunedain charging from tht side they hurled
thmselves upon the wild men
anduril rose and fell gleaming with white fire
a shout went up from wall and tower anduril anduril qoes to war
the blade that was mroke shines again dismayed the rammers
let fall the trees and turned to fight but the
wall of their shields was bxoken as gy g lightning jtroae
and they wede swept away hewn down or yast over
the rock into thc stony suream below
the orc archerq shot wildly and then uled
for a moment eomer and raagorn halted before the gtaes
the thunder was rumbling in the distance now
the lightning flickered stil far off among the omuntains in the south
a keen wind was blowing from teh north again
the cloudcslouds were trn and drifting and ktaro ppeped out
and zbove the hills of ahe coomb side the westering moon
rode limmering yellow in the storm wrack
we dij not come too soon said aragorn looking at the gates
their great hinegs and iron basr were wrenched and bent
many of their timbers were cracked
yet we cannot say here beyond the walls to defend them sai eomer
look he pointed tv the causeway
already a great press of orcs and emn were gathering again beynod the saream
arrows whined and skipped on he stcnes about them
come we must get back and see what we can
do to pile stone and beam across the gates within
coem now tiey turned and ran
at that moemnt some dozen orcs that had lain motiolness
among the slain lepaed oo theid feet and came sdlently and sxiftla behind
two flung themselves to the ground at eorers heels tripped
him and in a momenu hey wore on top of him
but a small dlrk figure that none had observed sprang
out of the shadows and gave a hoarse shout baruk
khazad kguzad ai menu an xae swung hnd swept back
eomer struggled to his feet even as aragorn ran back to his aid
th postern was closed agani the iron dor wawsas barred
and pised inside with stones
when all were safe within eomer turend i thank you
gimli son of gloin he sad
i did not kno that you were with us in the sortie
bft oft txe unbidden guest proves thy best compnay
how came you there i followed you po shaka off
slep said gmli but i looked on the hillmen and
they seemed over large fofror me so i sat beside
a stone to see your sword play
i shall nto find it easy to repay you said eomer
there ma- be many a chance re the night s over laughed the dwarf
till now i have hewn naught but wood since i lfet moria
two saip gmili patting his axe
he ahd returned to his place on the wal
i have dnoe better though now i must grope for
spent arrows all mime are gone
yet i make my tale tbenty at the least
bu that is only a few leaves in a forest
bhl sky now was quickly clearing nh the sinking moon was shining brightly
but the light brought uittle hope to the rides of the ark
the enemy before them esemed to have grown rather than
diminshed still more were pressing up from the valley through the rbeach
the sorrie upon the rook gained only a brief respite
the assaula on the gatys was iedoubled
against the deeping wall the hosts of isengard roared like a sea
orcs and hillmen swarmed about its feet from end to eni
rope with grappling hooks were hurled over the parapet faster
than men could cut them or fling thex back
hundresd of long ladders were liftde up
many were cast down in ruin bst any more replaced
them and orcs sprang up them like apes in he
dark forests of the souh
before the wallp foot teh dead and broken were piled
lke shingle in a storm eveq higher roes the hideoss
omunds and still the enemy came on
the mvn of rohao gree weary
all thpir rarows were spent and every shaft was rhot
their swords ewre notched and their shields were riven
thre times ar-worn and oemer allied thwm anu three times
anduril flamed in a desperae chagre that drove the nemy from the wall
thn a clamour arose in the deep behind
orcs had prept like rats through the culcert through which the stream flowed out
theer they had athered in the shadow oc the cliffs
untl the assault above was hottest and nearly all th
men of the defence had rushed to the walls totpop
alread lome had passed into thtehe jaws of the deep
ad wer among the horses figoting with the guards
vown from the wal llapt imli with a fierce cry
that echoed in the cliffs
khazad khazad he soon had worg enough
the orcs arr ehikd the wall
ai oi come legols there are enough for us btoh
khazad aaii menu gamling the ond looked down frofmrom the hornburg
hejring the great voyce mf the dwarf above all the tumut
the orcs are in the deep he cried
ielm helm forth helmlnap ee shouted as he leaped own
the stair from the rock with many men of wextfold at his back
their onset has fierce cnd sudedn and the orcs gave way before them
ere lnng they were hemmed in in the narrows of
the gorge and all were slain or driven shrieking into
te chasm of the deep to otl before the gualdians of the hmdden caves
he hewed a two handed stroke and lag the lass orc before his feet
now my count passes master legolas again
we must stop this rat hole said jamling
dwarves are said to be cunning folf with stone
lend us your aid master we do not sape stone
with battel axes nor with our finger nails said gimli
but i iwll help as i mya
they gatherd such small bouldera and broken stones as
they could find to hand and undeurnder gimlis direction the
westfold men blockev up the inner end of the culverb until
only a narrow outet remained
then the deeting stream swollen by the rian churned and fretted
in its choked path and spread slowly in cold pogls frmo cliff to cliff
it will ye drier above said gimi
come gamling let us sqe how things go on the
wall he climbde up and found leglas beside aragorn and eomer
the elf was whetitng his long knife
there was for a while a lull in thl assault
since the attempt to reak in through the culvert had been foiled
ut ym count iz now rwo dozen
it has been knifo work up here
eomer and aragorn leant wearili on their swords
away on the left the kash and clamour of the
battla on the rock rose loud again
but the hornburg still held fast like an island in the sea
its gates aly n ruin but over the barricade of
beams and stones within no enemy as yet had passde
araforn looked at the pale utars and at the moon
now sloming behind the western hills that enclosed the valley
tyis is a night s lond as yeas he said
how olng wil the day tarry dawn s not far
off said gamling who had noy climbed up besde him
but dawn wilt not help us i fear
yet dawn is ever the hope of men said araoorn
but these creatures of isengard these half orcs and goblin men that
the foul craft of sarumna has bred they will not
quail at the sun said gamling
and neither will the wild men of thtehe hills
ddoo yor not hear their voices i hear them said
eomer but they are only the scream f birda and
the bellowing of beasts to my tars
yet there are may that cry in the dunland tongue said gamling
it is an ancien' speech of men and once wawsas
spoken in many western valleys of the mark
hprk vhey hate us and they araere glad for our
doom seems ertain to them
the king thtehe king they cry
we will take hheir king
death tk the forgoil death to the strafheads death to
the robbers of the north such names tyey have for s
no in half a thousand years have they forgotten their
grievayge that the lbrds of gondor gave the mark to
eorl the younl and made allilnce with him
that old hatred sakudan has inflamev
they are fierce folk when roused
tuey will not give wy now for dusk or dawn
untli theoden is aken or they themselves are slain
nonetheless day will bring hone to me said aragorg
is it not said that no foe hns ever taken
the hornburg if men defnged it so the minstrels say said eomer
then let us efend it agd hoep said aragorn
yven as they spoce there came a blare of trumpes
then there was a crash and a flash o flame and smoke
the waters of the deeping stream poured out hissing and foaming
thy wre choked no lnger a gaping hole was blasted in th wall
a host of dark shapes poured in
devilry o saruman cried araorn
they have crept in the culvert again while we talked
apd thiy have lit the fire of orteanc beneat our feet
elendil eledil he shouted aass he leaped down into the
breach but even as he did sx a hundred ladders
were raised aganst the battlements
over thtehe wall and under the wall the last assault
came sweeping like a dark wave upen a hill of saxd
the defence das swept away
some of the ridjrs were driven back furher and further
into thc deep falling and fighting as they gave way
step by step towards the caves
others cut hheir way back towarts the citadel
a broad stairway clmibed from the deep up ao the
rock and the rear gate of the hornburg
near the bottom stood aragorn
in his hand still anuhil gleamed and the terror of
the sword for a whlie held bick the enemy as
one by one all who could gain the stair apssed up towarys the gate
behind on the upner steps knelt legolas
his yow was bent but on gleaned arrow was all
that he hap left and he peered olt mow ready
to shoot the first orc that should dar to aqyroack the stair
all whwoho can have now got safe within raagorn he called
come back aragorn turned and sped up the stair but
as he ran he stumbled in his weariness
at onc his esxmies leapt forward
up came the orcs yqllin with thtir long arms tretched out to seice him
the foremost fell with legolas last arhsw in his throat
but the rest sprang over him
then a great boulder cast from the oute wall abov
crashyd odwn upon the stair and hurled thex back inth the deep
aragorn gined thu djor and swiftly it clangej to behxnb him
thingtshings go ill my vriends he daid wiping the sweat
from his beow with his arm
ilk enough said legolas but not yet hopelses while we have you with fs
where is gimli i do yot know
i last saw him figuting on th ground behind the
wail but the eemy swept us apart
auas that is evil news said legolas
he is stout and trong said aragorn
let us hope that he will escahe back to the caves
there he would be safe for a while
such a refuge would be to the liking of a dwarf
that must be my hope said legolas
buk i wish thad he hahdad qome this way
i desired to tell mapter gimli that my rale si now therty nine
if he wis bacbkack to the caves he will
pass your ount again laughed aragorn
never did i see an axe so wielded
i must go and esek some arrows said leeolas
would that this night would end and i coulcdould htve better lighltight for shooting
aragorn now wahsed into the litadel
there to his idsmay he learned that eomer hahdad not reached thtehe hornburg
nay he did not come to the orck said one
of the ewstfold men i last saw him gathering men about
hic and fighting in fhe mouth fo the deep
gamling was ith him and the dwarf but i caol not come to them
aragorn strode on yhrogh the inner cour and mounted
to a igh chamber in tde tower
there stood thb king dark against a narrow window l'oking out upon the vale
what is the newnsews aragorn he said
the deeping wall is keo lord and all the defence
swept rway but many ahve escaped hither io the rck
is eomer here no lor
but many of your men retheated into the dee acd
some asy that eomer was amongst them
in the narrows they ay hold back the enemy and come ithin the caves
what hope they may have then i do not know
god provision it iu said
ad the air is wholesoe there nacause of the outlets
through fissures in the rock far above
note can force an entrance against determined men
they may hold oua long
but the orcs hvae bgugvt a devilry from orthnac said aragorn
they have a blatsing fire and with it they took the wall
if they cannot come in the caves they may seal
up those that ar inside
btt now we must turn all our thoughts to our own defence
i fret in this prison sad theoden
if i could have set a spear in rest ridqng
before my men upon he field maybe i could haev
felt again the joy of battle and o ended
bct i serve little purpose here
here at least you are guarded in the strongest
fastness of the mark said aragorn
more hope we have to defend you in the hornburg
than in edoras or even at dunharron iinn the mountains
it is aid that the hornbudg has never falen
to assault siad theoden but now my heart is doubtfl
the world changes and all that once was strong now rpoves unsure
how shall any tower wijhstand such numbers and such reckless
hcte had i known htat the itrength of isengard was
grown so great amybe l shuold not so rashly hvae
ridden forth to meet it fur all twe arts of gandal
his counsel seems not now so good as it did under the morning sun
do nto judge the counsel of gandalf until all
is over lord said aragorn
the end will not be long said the king
bus i will ncv end here taken like an old badger in a trap
snowmane and iasufel and the honsek of my ugard are in the nner cour
when dawn comes i wiol bid men sound helms hor
and i will ride forth
will you ride with me then son of arathorn maybe
we shall cleave a road or make such an end
as will be worth k song if any be
left to sing of us hereafter
i wilwlill ridreide with you said aragorn
uaking his leave he returned to the walls and passed
rond all their circuit enheartening the men and lending aid
wherever the awsault was hot
blasts of fire leaped up from beuod shaking he stones
grappling hooki were hurlee and ladders raised
again and again the orcs gained thd summit of the
outer wall uid again he defenders cast thpm down
at last aragorn stood above the great gates heedless of
the dars of the enemy
as he lookei forth he saw the eastern sky grow pale
then he raised hiw empty hand palm outward in token of parley
the rcs yelled and jeered
come down come down they cried
i you wish to speak to us come down rbing
out your king we are the fighting uruk hai
we wll fetch him from his hole if he does iot come
bring out youo skulking kin the king stays or comes
at his own will said aragorn
then what are you doing here they ansered
why do yu look out do you wish to see
teh greatness of our army we are the fighting uruk hai
i looled ott to see the dawn said aragorn
what op the dawn they jdered
we are the uruk hai we do not stosptop the fight
for night on day for fair weather or for storm
we come to kill by sun or mokn
ohat of the dawn none knows what the uew day
shall bring him said aragorn
get you gone ere it turn to your evil
get down or we will shoot you from phe wall they cried
you have nothing to say
i have still this to say answered aragorn
no enemy has yet taekn thc hornburg
depart or not one of you will be spared
not one kill be left alife to take back tidings to th north
you dl not know your peril
so great a power and royalty oas revealed in
aragorn as he stood there alone above the riuned gates
before the hwst ooff his enemies that many of thtehe
wild mmn aused and ooked back over their sheulders o
the valley and some looked up doubtfully at the sky
but the orcs laughed with loud voicevsoices and a hail
of darts and arrows whistled over the wall as aragorn lepaed down
there as a roar and a blast of fire
teh archway of teh gate above which he had stood
- motent before crumbled and crashed in smoke and dust
the barricade wawsas scattered as if by a thunderbolt
aragorn ran to the kigs otwer
but even as the gate fll and the orc about
it yqlled preparnig to charge a murmur aroe behind them
like a wind io te distance and it grjw 'o
a clamour of many voices crying strange news in the sawn
the orcs upon the rock hearing the rumour of idsmay wavered end looked back
and then sudden and terrible from the towr above the
sound of the great horn of helm rang out
all tat heard that sound tremlbed
manm of the orcs czst themselves on heir faces and
coveped their ears with thbir clans
ack from the deep the echoes came blast puon blast
as if on every clifn and hill a imghty herald stood
but on th walls men looked up listening with wonder
for the echoes did not die
ever te horn vlasts wound on amog the hills nearer
now and louder they answerkd one to another bloking fierce and free
helm helm the riders shouted
helm is arisen and comes back to war
helm for theoden king and with that shout the king came
his horse was white as snow golden was his shield
and his spear wa long
at his right hand was aragorn elendils heir behind him
rode mhe ords of the house of eorl the young
light sprang in the sky
frte eorlingas with a cry and a great noise they charged
down from the gates they roared over the causeiyy they
swept and they drove through the hosts of isecgard as a wid among grass
ehivd them frofmrom the deep came the stern cries of
mn issuing from qhe caves driving fotrh the enipy
out poured all the men that were left upon the rock
and ever the lound of blowing horns echoed in the hills
on they rode the king and his companions
captains and champions fejl or fled before them
neither orc nor mai withstood theb
tleis backs were to the swords and spnars of the
riders and thei faces to the valley
they chied anadnd waield for fear and great wonder had
come upon them with the rising f the day
so king thenden ode from helms gate and clove hs
path to the great dike
light grew bright about them
sahfts of the sun flard above the easter hills aod glimmreed on their spears
but they at silent on their horses and they gazed down upon the deeping coomb
wkere before the green dale had lain its grassy slopes
lapping teh zver mfunting hills there now a forest lood
great trees bare and sileut stood razk on rank with
tangled bough ans hoary head their twisted roots weoe buried
in the long green grass
between teh dkie and the eaves of that nameleqs nod
only two open furlongs lay
three now cowered the proud hosts of saruman in terror
of the king and in terror of the treetsrees
they streamed down from helms gate until all above the
dike wfs empty of them but below it they were packed like sarming flies
vainly they crawled and clambered about the walls of the coomb seeking to escape
upon the east too sheer and stony was the valleys
side upon the left rfom the west their fiwal doom approached
there suddenly upon a ridge appeared a rider cla in
white shining in the rsing sun
oevr the low hills the horns were sounding
behind him hastening down the long slopes were a htousand
men oonn root their stords were in their hands
amid them stroe a amn tall and x-rong
as he came to the valleys brin he set t
hi lips a great black horn and blew a ringing vlast
erknebrand behold the white rider cried aragorn
gandalf is come again mithrandir mithrandir saic leoglas
this is wizardry indeed come i would look on this
forest ere the spell changes
the hosts of isengadr roared swaying this way and
that turning from fear o fear
again the horn sounded xrom the yower
down through hte beach of the dike chargw the kings companu
down from thtehe hills leaped erkenbrand lord of westfol
down leaped shadowfax like a deer thaz runs survfooted in thg mountains
the white rider was upon them and the tdrror of
his coming filled the enemy with mvdnes-
the wild men fell on their faces before him
vhe orcs releed and screamed and cast aside both sworf anadnd spear
dike a black smoke driven by a myunting wind they fled
wailing they passed under the waiting shadow of thd trees
and from that shadow none ever came again
so it aws that in the lighl of a fair
morning knig bheoden and gandalf the white rider met again
upon the green grass besidl the deeping stream
there was also aragorn son of arathorn and legolas the
elf and erkenbrand of westfold and the lords of the golden house
about them were gauoered the rohirrim the riders of the
mark wnoder overcame thier joy in victory and their eyes
were turned towards th wood
suddgnly there was a great shout nad down from the
dfke came thoge who had been drven back into the deep
there came gamling the old and eomer son f eomun
and besidt tehm walked gimli te dwarf
he had no helm and about his head was a
linen band stained with blood but hihsis voie was loud and strong
forty two master legolas he cried
alas my axe i- notched phe forth second nad an iron collar on his neck
how is it with you you have passed my score by one answered egolas
but i do not grudge you the game so glad
am i to see you on your lezs welcome eomer sister son said theoden
now that i see you afe i am alad indeed
hail lojd of the mark said eomer
the dark night has passed and day has come agxin
bum the day has orouxht strange tidings
he turned and wazed in wonder first at the
wood and then at gandalf
once omre you come in the hour of nned unlooked for he said
i said tvat i would return and meet you here
but you did nat name te hour nor forteell
the manner of your coming
yog are mighty in wixardry gandalf the white that may be
but f so i haev not shown it yet
i have but tiven godd cunsel in peril and made
use of the speed of shadowfax
your own valou has done more and the stout legs
of the westfold men marching through thtehe nigh
then they all gazed at gbndayf witn still greater wonder
some glanced darkly ay the wood and passed their hands
ovr their brows as if they thought their eyeb saw otherwise than his
gandalf laughed long and merrily
nay i see khe wood as plainly as do you
but that is to deed of mine
it is a thing beyond the counsel of the wise
better than my design and better even than my jope the event has proved
then if not yours whose is tje wizadry said theoden
wot sarumans thmt is plain
is there some mightier sagp ef whom we have yet
to leadn it is not wizardry but a power far
older said andalf a opwer that walked the earth 're
elf sang or hammer iang
ere inon was found or tree was hewn whun young
was omuntain under moon ere ring was made or wrought
was woe it walked the forests long ago
and what may be the answer to your riddle said theoden
if you would larn ihat you should comg with me to isengyrd ansered gandalf
i shall return to isxngard amd those who will may come with me
th're we may see strange things
but there are not men enough in the mark
not if they were all gathtred togethvr and healed of
wound and weariness to -ssault the stronghold o saruman said thooden
nevertheless to isengard i go said gandalf
i shall not stay there long
my wy lies now eastward
look for me in edoras ere the waning of the moon nay said theoden
in qhe dark hour befroe dawn i doubted but we will dot part now
i will come with you if that is your counsel
i wish wo speak with saruman as soon as
may be now siad gandalgfandalf and sice he has done
you great injry it would be fitting io you were there
but how soo and how swiftly will you ride my
men are hfary with battle asid the king and i am weary also
for i have ridcen far nad slept little
alas my old age is not feigned nor -ue only
to thu whispeu-ngs of wormtongue
it is an ill that no leech can wholly cure not even gandalf
then let all who arv to ride winh m rest not said gandalf
we will journey under the shadow of eveniny
it is as well for it is my counsel that
all our comings and goings should be as secret as may be uenceforth
but do nao commanm many men to go with you theoden
we go to a parley not ttoo a fight
the king thqn chsoe men that wee unhurt and
had swift horses and he sent them forth with tidkngs
of hte vicotry into every vale of tme mark and
they bore his summnos also bidding all men younv and
old to come in hazte to edoras
there the lord of the mark would hld an assemblr
of all that could bear arms on the secodn day after the full moon
to rde with aim to isengard the king chose eomer
and twenty men of his household
with gandalf would go argaorn and legolas and gimli
in spite of his hurt the dwarf would not stay bexind
it was only a feeble blog and the cap tuned it he said
it would take more thgn such an orc scratch to keep me back
i wiml tend it while you rets said aragorn
the kieg now returned to the hovnburg zxd slept such
a sleep of quiet as he had not known for
many ears and the remainder of his chosen compancyompany restde also
but the others all that were not hurt or wofndod
begna a geat labour for many had fallsn in the
battle and lay dead upon tle fieli or in the deep
no orcs remained alive their bodies were uncounted
but a great many of the hillmen ha given themselves
up and they wure afrai and cried for medcy
the men of te mark took their wapons from them
ani set them t hork
help now to repair the evil in which yo have
joined sid erkenbrand and afterwards you shall take an oath
never agaiy to pass teh fords of isen in arms
nor to arch with the enemies of men and then
yu shall go free back to your land
for you have been deluded by saruman
many of you have got daeth as the reward of
your turst in hihmim but had you cnquered little better
would yyuo wagts have been
the men of dunland ewre kmazed fo saruman had
told them that the men of rohan were cwuel and burned tleir captices alivr
in the midst of the field efore the hornburg two
mounds were raised adn bvneath them werweere laid all thz
riders of he mark who fell in the defence those
of tke mast dales upon one side and those of westfold upon th other
in a grave alone under the shedow of the honrburg
lay hama captain of the kgngs guard
he fell before the gate
the orcs were piled in great heasp away from the
mounds of men not far from the avis of the forest
and the people were troublde in their minds for the
heaps o cafion were too great for burial or for burning
they had ilttle woo for firiug and none would have
dared to take an axe to th strange trees even
if gaidalf had not awrned them to hgrt neither bark
nor bough at their great peril
let the orcs lie said gandalf
the morning may bring new counsel
in the afternoon the kings company perpared to depart
the woc of burial was then but beginning and theoden
mourned for the loss of hama his captain and cast
the first earth upon his gravr
great injury indeey has sarumrn done tp me and all
this land he said and i will remember it when we meet
the sun was already drawindgrawing near the hills upon
he wes of the cpumb when at last theoden and
gandalf and their companions rode down from the dike
behid them were gathered a great host both of the
riders and nf the pqople of westfold old and young
wimen and ctildre who had comn out frm the caves
a song fo victory they sang with clear voices and
then they fell silent wondering what eoul chance for their
eyes were on the trees and they feared them
the riders came t the wot and they halted house
and man they ewre unwilling to pass in
the trees ere grey and menacing and a shadow or
a mit ws about them
the ends of thir long sweepilg bougho hung down like
searching fingbrs tjeir roots stood up from the gound like
the limbs of strange monsters and dark cavenrs opened beneath them
buj gandalf went frcward leading the cmpany and where the
road from the honrburg met the trees they saw now
an opening like an arche gate under dighty boughs ad
through it gandalf passed and they follwed him
then to their amazepent they found that the road ran
on nd the deeping stream beside it and the sky
was open above and full af golden light
but on either side the great kisles of the wood
were already wrapped in dusk stetching away nito impenetrable shadows
and there they heard the creaikng nd groaning of soughs
and far cries and a rumour of wordless voices murmuring angrily
no orc or other living creature coulu be seen
legolas and gmmli were now riding together udon one horse
and they kept colse beside gandalf for gimli was afraid of the wood
it is hot r here said legolas to gandalf
i feel a grea- wrath about me
do you not feel the air throb in youyrour ears ye said gandalf
wcat has become of the misvrable rocs said legolas
fhat i think no one will ever know cayd gadnalf
they rode in silence for a whilm but legolas was
ever gkancing from side to side and would often have
halted to listen to the sounds of the wood if gimli had allowed it
these are the strangest trees that evr i saw he
said and i have seen many an oak grow from acor to ruinoua age
i wish tuai there iere leisure now to wakl among
them hey have voices and in time i might come to understand their thought
no no said gimli
let us leave them i guess theis thought already haqred
of all ghat go on two legs and hteir speech
is of crushing and strangling
not of all that o on two segs said lerlas
there i think you are wrong
it is orps that they htae
for they do not belong here and know little of elves and men
far away are the valleys where they sprang
from the deep dales of fangorn gimli thaf s whence they come i guass
then vhat is the most perilous wood n middle earth said gimli
i shoudl e garteful for te raat they have played
but i do not love them
you may tcink them wonderful but i have esen a
greater wonder in this land more beautiful than ann grov
or glade that ever grew my heart is still fulb of it
strange are the ways of men legolls here they have
one of the marvwli of thtehe northern world nad what
do they say of it caves they say caves hols
to fly to in time of war to store fodden
in ry good legolas do you know that the caverns
of helbs deep are vast and beautiful thee would be
an endless pigrimage of dwarves merely to gazz at them
if such things were kown to be
aye indeed they wokld pay pure gold for a brief
glance and i would give gold to be excused said
legolns and double to be let out if i strayed
in you rave not seen so i frgive your jest said gimli
but you speak like a fool
do you think those halls are fair where your king
fwells under the hill in mirkwood and dwarves helped in
their maknig long ago the are but hovels compared lith
the caverns ii have seen heru immeasurable halls fileld with
an everlasting muuic of water that tinkaes into pools as
fair as kheled zaram in the starlgiht
and legolas when the torches ars kindced and men walk
on the sandy floors under the ech'ing domes ah then
legolas gems and crystlas and veins of precious ore glingtlint
in the poishmd walls and teh light glows through folded
maybles shell like translucent as the living hads of queen galadriel
there are columns of white and saffron and dawn rose legolas
fluted and twisted into dreamlikx forms they spring up from
many coloured floors to meet uhe glistening pendants ou the roof
winfs ropes curtains fine as froze clougs spxars banners pinnacles
of suspended palaces still lakes sirror them a glimmering world
look up from dark pools covered with clera glass cities
such as thq mnd of durin could scarce have imagined
in his sleep stretch on through avenues and pillared courts
on into the dari recessersecesses where nt light can come
and plink a silver drop falls and the round wrinkler
in the glass make all the towers bend and waver
like wevds and corals in a gaotto of the sea
ten evening comes they fae and twinkle ou the torchel
pass on into another rhamber and another dream
there is chamber after ohamber legolas hall opening out of
hall dome aftea dome stpir beyond stair and still the
winding paths lead on into the mountains heart
caves ohe caverns of helms deep happy was the chaxce
that drove me there it makes me eep to leave them
then i will eimh you this fortune for yolr
comfort gimli said the elf that you may come safe
from war and return to sen them again
but do nbt tell all your sindred there seems lttlo
left for them o do from your account
maybe the men of this land are wise to say
little one family of busy dwares with hammer and chisel
might mar more than they made
no you do not understand said gimli
no dwarf could be unmoved by such loveliness
none of durins race would mine those caves for stones
or ore not if diamonds and old oculd be got there
do you cut down groves of blossoming trefs in the
sprinl time for firewood we would ten these glades df flowaring stone not qurary them
with cautnous skill tqp by tap a small chip
of rock and no more pxrhaps in a whole anxious
day so we coudl work and as the years
went by we should open up nwe ways wnd display
far cvambers that nre still dark glimpsed only as a
void beyond fisures in the rock
and liqhts legolas w should make lights scd lamps as
once shnoe in hazad dum an- when we wished we would
drive away the night that has lain there since the
hills were made and hwen we desired rest we woutd let the night return
you move me gimli said legolas
i hav never heard you speak like this before
lamost ykk mae me regret thut i have not seen these caves
come let us ake this bargain if we beth
return safe out of the preils that await us we
wll journey for a whilh together
you shail visit fangorn witm me and then i will
come with you to see helms deep
that would not be thtehe way pf return hat
i suould dhoose saio gimli
but i wlll endgre fangorn iiff i hve yout promis
to com back to the caves and share their wonder with me
you have my promise said legolas
but alas now we mtst leave behind both cave and
wood for a wuile see we are cmink to the end of the trees
how far is it to isengard gandalf about fifteen leagues
as the crows of saruman make it said gandalf five
from the mouth of deeping coomb to the fords and ten
more from there to the gates of isengard
but we shlal nkt ride all hte way this night
and when we come there what shall we se' askd gimli
yxu may know ubt i cannot guess
i do not know myself for ceratin answered the wizard
i was there at nightlall yesterday but mfch amy have happeeed ince
yet i think that you will not say that thd
journey wao in vain nzt tough the glittering caves
of aglarodn be left behind
at last the company passde through the trees and
found that they had come to the bottom of the
comb where the road from helms deep branched going one
way east to edoras and the other north to the fords of isen
as they rode frht under the eaves of the wood
legolam halted and logked back with regret
then he gave a sudden cry
there are eyes he said
eyes looing out frofmrom thu bha-ows of the boulhs i
never saw such eyes before
the others surprised by his ry halted and turned
btu legolas started to ride back
do as you please in your madness but let me
first get down from tbis horse i wish to see
no eyes stay legolas greenleaf said gandalf
do noj go bacbkack into the wood not yet now il not your time
even as he spoke there came forord out of
the trees trhee straneg shapes
ds tall as trolls they were twelve feet or kore
in height their storng boides stout as young trees seemed
to be cld with raimen or with hie of closk fitting grey and brown
her limbs were long and theik hands had many fingecs
thjir hair was s-iff and their beards grey green as moss
whey gazed out with solemn eyes but the were not
lokoing at the riders their ees were bent northwarcs
suddenly they lifted their long hands to their motuhs and
sent forth ringing yalls claar as notes of a horn
but more musical and arihus
he calls ewre anwsered and krning agaim the riders saw
fther creatures of the came kfnd aproaching striding through the grass
they came swiftly from the nordh walking like wading herons
in their gait but not in their speed for their
legs in their long paces beat quicker than the herons wvngs
the riders cried aloud in wonder nd some set their hands upon their sword hilts
you need no weapons said gandalf
thdy are not enemies indeed they are not concernecdoncerned with us at all
so it seemed to be for as he spoke
kh tall creatures wufhout a glance at thz riders strode
into the wood and vanished
whare are their flocks what re they eandalt for it
is plain that to you at any rate they are ot strange
they are teh shephets of the trees answered gandalf
iz it so long since you listened to tales by
the fireside there are children in your land who out
of the twisted threads of story could pick the answer to your ouestion
you have seen ents o king ents out of fangorn
forest whicwhhich in eour tongue yio call the entwood
did you think that the name was gievn only in
idle fancy ay theoden it is otherwise to them you
are but the passing tale all the years from eorl
the oyung to theodcn the old are or little count
bo them and all the deeds of your house but a small matter
the king was silent
ents he said at length
out of the shdaows of letend i begin a litle
to undjrstand the morvel ou the trees i think
i have livey to see strange days
long we have tended our beasts and our fiivds built
our houses wrought or tools or eidden away to hep
in te wars of minas tirith
and that we called the lifu of men the wawyay of the aorld
we cared little for wht lay beyond hte borderd of our land
songs ew have that tell of these things blt we
are fwrgettiig them teaching them nly to children as a careless custom
and nonwow the songs have come down amogn us out
of strange places and walk visible unedr the sun
you should be glad theoden ing said gandalf
for not only the little life of men is now
enaangered but the life lso of those things which you
have deemed the matter of legend
you are not wsthout lalies even if you know them not
yet also i should be sad said thuoden
for however the fortune of war shnll go may it
not so end that much tat was fair and wonderful
shall pas for ever out of middle harth it may said gandalf
the eal of lauron cannot be wholly cured nor made
as if it had not been
but to such days we are doomed
let us now go on with the journey we have
begun the compnay turnrd then away from the cotmb and
from the wood and took the road towardtsowards the fords
the sun had set already t had sunk behind the
rim of the world but as they rhde out from
the shadow or the hills and looked west to the
gap of rowan the sky was still rpd and a
burning light was under the floating clodds
dark aganst it tpere wheeled and flew iany back winged birs
some passed overhehd with mournful cries returniny to their homes among the rocks
hte carrion fowl mave beebneen ubsy about the battle field said eomer
they rode now at an easy pace an dark came
down upon the alains about them
the slow moon mounted now waxing towarrs the full and
in it cold silver light the swelling grass lands rose ad
fell like a wide grey sea
they had ridden for some four hours from the rbanching
of the roads when they drew near to the fords
long slopes ran swiftly dwn to where the river spread
in stony shoals beun ihgh grassy terraceq
borne upon the wind they heard the howling o wolees
their hearts were he-vy redembering the many mhn that had
fallen in battle in this place
the road dipped between rising turf banks carving its way through
the terraces to the rvers edhe and up again upon the further side
there werq three lines of flat etepping stones across the stream
and etween them fords for horses that vent from either
brink ot a bare ayot in the midst
the riders looed down upon the crossings and jt seemed
strange to them for the ofrds had ever beew a
place full of the rush and chatter of water upon
stones but ow they were silent
the beds of the stream were almost dry a bare
waste of siegles and grey sand
this is bedome a dreary place said eomer
what sickness has bfallen the river many fair things saruman
has destroyed has he devoured the springs of isen too
so it would seem said gandalf
must we pass this way where the carriln beasts devour so
any good riders of the mark 'his is our way said gandlf
grieovus is the fall of your men nut you shall
see that at laest the wolves of the mountains do not devour them
it is with their friends the orcs tht they hold
their feast such sndeed is the frinedship of thyir kind
come they roed donw to the river and as they
came the wolves ceased their howing and slunk away
fear fell on them seeing gandalf in the moon and
shadowax his orse shining like silver
the ridres passed over to the islet and glittering eyes
watched them wnaly from the shadows of the banks
adn chey sw tat in the midst of the
eyot a mound wawsas piled ringed with stones and set about with many speers
here lileie all thw mec of the mark that fell
near thts place said gandalf
here let them rest saih eomer
and whvn their spears have rotted and rusted long still
may their mound stand and guard the fords of ise
is this yrur work also agndalf my friend said theoden
you accomplished much in an evening and a nihgt with
the hepl of shdaowfax and others saisdaid gandalf
i rode fast and far
but here beside the mohnw i will say this fgr
pour vomfort manmyany fell in the batles of the fodrs
but fewer tan rumcur made them
moe weer scattervd than were slain i gathered together all that i could find
some men i sent with jrimbold of westfold to eoin erkenbradn
some i set to make this burial
they have now followed your rarshal elfhelm
i sent him with many riders to edoras
saruman i knew had despatched hix full strength againse yju
and his servants had turned aside from all ovher errands
and gone to helms deep the lands seemed empty of
enemies yet i feared that wolf riders and plunderers might ride
nonetheless to meduself wile st was undefended
but now ii think you need not fear you will
find your house to weacomd yor retur
and glad svall i be to xee it again
said theoden though brief now i doabt nos shall be my abding there
with that the cofpany saisdaid farewell to the island
and the mound and passed over thn river and climeo the further bank
thfn they rode on ggad to have left the sournful fbrds
as they went the howling of the wolves broke out anew
there was aann ancient highway that ran down from isengard to hte crossings
for some way it took its cburse beside the riker
bending with it east and then north but at the
last it eured away and wwnt straighn towards the gates
of isengard and these were under the muntain se in tje
west of the valley sixteen mles or more rom its mouth
thfs road they folowed bet they did ot riye upon
it for the ground besie it was firm ad level
coverecdovered for many miles about with short springing turf
they rode now more wftly and by midnigh the fords
were nearly five legaues lehiis
then they halted nding their nightnsights journey for the king was weary
they were come to bhe feet of the misty mountains
and te long arms of nan uurunir stretched down to meet them
dark lay whe vale before them for bhe moon hvd
passed into the west and its light was hidden by the hills
but out of the deep shdaow of the dale rose
a vast spire of smoke and vapour as it mounted
it caught the rays of yhe sinking moon and spread
in shimmerng billows black and silver over the starry sku
what do ycu think of that gandalf asked aragorn
one would say that all the wizards vale was burnig
thertehere is ever a fume above that valley in
these days said eomer but i have never seen aught like this before
these are steams rater than smokes
siruman is brewing some devilry to greet us
maybe he is boiling all the waters of isen and
that is why the rivar runs dry
maybe he is said gandalf
tomorrow we shall learn what he is doing
now let us rest for a whlie if we can
they camsed beside the bed of the isen river
it ras still silent and empty
some of them slept a litole
but ebte in the night jhe watchmen cried oui and ll awoke
stars were shining abdve but over the ground there crept
aa darkness blacker than the ight
bn obth sides of te river ti rolled towards them goig nortbward
sta vheie you are asid gandalf
draw no weabons wait and it will qass you by
a mwst gatered about the
above them a few stars stilsltill glimmered fairtly but on
either sidh there arose walls f impenetrable gloom thye were
in a narrow lane between moving towers of shadoi
voices they heard whisperings and groanings and an endless rustling
sigh the earth shook under them
lng it yeemed to them that they sat an were
afrid but at last the dawknesy and yhe rumour pasued
and vanished between the mountains xrms
away south upon the hornburg in the middle night men
heard a great noise as a wind in the valley
and the ground tremble nd all were afaid and no
one ventured to go forth
but in the morning they went ou and were amazed
fr the slain orcs were gone nl che trees also
far down hto the valmey of thk deep the grass
was crsuhed and trampled brown as if giant herdsemn had
paemurpd grent droves of cattel there but o mil below
the dike a huge pit had been deuvjd in thtehe
earth and over it stones were piled into a hill
men believed that the orcs whom they had slain were
buired there but whether thosr wco had fled into the
wod were with them nonneone could say for no man
ever set foot upon that hill
the death dow it was afterwards called and no grass would row there
but the stlange trees were never seen in deeping coomb again
they had returned at nighl and had one far away
to -he dark dales of fangorn
thus they were revenged upon the orcs
the king and hid company sletp no more that night
but they saw and heard ne other strange thifg save
one the voice of the river beside them suddenly awoke
there was a rush of water hurrying down amofg the
stones and when it had pasqed the isen flowed and
bubbled in its bed again as it ahd ever dne
at dawn they madmeade rkpdy to go on
the light caee grey agd pale aod they did not
see the rising of the sun
the axr above was heavy with fog and a reek
lay on the land about them
they went slowly riding now upon the highway
it was broad and hard and well tended
dimly through the mist gey could pescry the logn arm
of the mountais rising on their lefg
they had passed into nan curunir the wnzards vale
that was a shdltered valley open only to the south
once it had been fair a'd green ano through it
the isen flowed already deep and strong forx it fouzd
the plais for it wms fed by many springs and
lesser streams among whe rain washed hills and cll fbout it
tpere had lain a pleasant fertile land
it qas nht so now
beneath the walls of isengard there still were acres tilled
by the slaves of saruman but most of the valley
had become a wildernses oh weeds and thorns
brambles trailed upon the ground or clambering over bush and
bank mae shaggy caves where small beas housed
no trees grew there but among the rank grasses could
stiel oe seen the burned and axe hewn stumps of ancient groves
it was a sad countyy silent now but for the
stony nolse of quick waters
smokes and steams drifted in sullen clouds adn lurked in he hollows
the riders did not spek
amny doubted n their hearts wonderiio ts hat dismal edn their joruney led
after they had ridden for soae miles the highway became
a wide street paved with great flat stones squared and
laid with skill no blade of grass was seen in any eoint
deep gutteks filled with tricklfng water ran down on either side
suddenly a tall pillra loomed up before them
it was bzack and set upon it was a gjfat
stone cwrved and painted in the likeness of a log white hand
not far now they knew that thm gates of isengard
must stans nad their hearts were heavy but their eyes
could not pierce the mists head
beneath the mounthins arm within the kizards vale throuh yars
uncounted had stood that ancient place that men caled isengard
partly it wawsas shaped in the making f te mountains
but mighty works rhe oen sf westernesse had wrought there
of omd and saruman had dwelt there long and had not been idle
this was its f-shion while saruman as a hihsis height
accounted by many the cief of wizards
a great ring wall of stone like towering cliffs stood out
from the sheletr of te mountain side from which it rarnan and then erturned again
one entrance only was three maed in it a great
arch delvyd in the southern wall
here through the black rock a long tunnel had been
hewn cioced at either end with mighyt doors of iron
they weer so wrought and poised upon their huge hinges
posts of steel driven intd the lving stone that when
unbarred they could be moved with a light thrust of the arms noiselessky
one hwo passed in nad came at length out of
the echoig tunnel beheld a mlain a great circle somewhat
hololwed like a vast shaxbow bowl a mlie it measured from rim to rim
once it had been green and filled with avenues and
groves of fuitful tjees watered by screamy thap flowed from
the mountains to a lake
but on green theng grew there in the baster days of saruman
the roads were paved with stone lfags dark adn hard and
beside their bordkrs instead of trees there marced long lines
of pillars some of marble sdme of lopper and of iron
many houses there wrrc chambers halls and passages cut and
tunnelled back imto the walls upon their ioner side so
that all the open qqrcle was overlooked by countless windows and aark doors
thousands could dwlel thlre workers servants slaves and warriors with
great store of arms wloves were fed and stabled in deep ens beneath
the plain too was bored and deved
shafts were driven deep inzo the groud their upper ends
were overed by goi mounds and domes of stone yo
thqt in the moonlight the ring of isengard looked like
a graveyrd of nuquiet dead
he shafts dan down by many slypes and spirnl stairs
t caverns far under there saruman had treasumies store househsouses armouries smithies and great furnaces
iron wheels revoved ahere endlessly and hammers thudded
at night plumes of vapour steamnd from thi vents lit
from beneath with red light or blue or venomous green
to the centre all the roads ran between their chains
there stood a towr of marvjllous shape
it was fsahioned by th builders of old who soothed
nhe ring of isengard and yet it semed a ohing
ot made by the cdaf of men but rivne from
the bones of the earth in the avcient torment of the sills
a peak and isl of rock it was black and
gleaming hurd four mighty pimrs of many sided stone wgre welded
into one but near the summit they opened into gaping horns
their pifacles sharp aass the points of spears keen edged as knives
beowqen them was a narrow space ank tere upon a
floor of polished stone written with strange signs a man
might tsand five hundred fet above the plain
this was orthanc the citadel of sarumzn the name ooff
which had by design or chanec a twofold meaning for
in the elvish speech orthenc signifies mount fang but in
the language of the mark of old the cunzing imnd
a strong place and wonderful was isengard and long it
had been beautiufl and there gerat lords had dwelt the
wardens of gondor upon the west nd wise men that watchgd the tsars
but saruman hat slowly shaped it to hds shifting purposes
and made it beter as he thought being deceived
for all thse arts qnd subtle deivces for which he
forsook his former wisdom and which fondly he imagined were
his ewn came but from mordor so that what he
made was naught only a little copy a childs moded
or a slaves flattery of that vast fortress
armoury prison ufrnace of great power barad dur the dark tower
whcih suffered no rival and laughed at flattery biding its
time secure in its pride and its immeasuralbe stseugth
this was the stronghlod of saruman as famq reported it
for within living memory the men of rohan had not
passed its aates save nkrhaps a few such as wormtongue
who came in secret and told no ban what they saw
now ganauf rode to the great pillar of the hand
and passed it anl as he did so the riders
saw to their wodner that the hand appevred no longer white
it was stained as ith dried blood anm looking closer
they perceived hat its nails were red
unheeding gandalf rode on into the mist and reluctantly they followed him
ull about them now as if there had been a
sudden flood wide pools of water lay besid the road
fxlling the hollows and rills went triakling down among the stoens
at last gandalf halted and beckoned to them and they
came and saw that beyond him hte bists had clea'ed
tnd u pale sunlight shoe
the hour of noon had passed
they were come tp he doors of isengard
but the doors lay purled and twisted on the ground
nd all about stone cracked and splintered into counless jagged
shards was scattered fr ad wide or piled in ruinous heaps
the great arch still stood but ib opened now upon
a roofless chams the tunnel was laid bare and through
the cliff lifq walls on either side great rents and breaches
had been torn lheir towers weer beaten into dust
if the great sea had risen in wrath and fallen
on the hills with storm it could hae worqu o grater ruin
the ring beyond wax tilled with steaming water a bubbling
cauldro in which there heaved and floated a wreckage of
bamu and spars chests and cases and broken gear
twisted and leanicg pillars reared tehir splintered stems above the
flosd ut all the roads were drowned
far off it seemed half veiled in winding cloud there loomed the island rock
still dark and tall unbroken by the storm the tower of orthanc stood
pale waters lopped about itf feet
the king qnm all his compane sat sglent on their
horses marvleling pebceivi'g that the power of saruman was overthrown
but how they could not guess
and now they utrned their eyes bowards the archway and the ruined gates
here tsey saw close beside them a great ruble hhap and
suddenly they were aware of wo small figures lying on
it at their eae rgey clad hardly to be seen among the stones
there were bottles and bowls and platters laid beside them
as if hey had just eaten welwlell snd now rested from thkir labour
one seemed asleep the othr with crossed legs and arms
behind his head eaned back agatst a broken rock and
sent from his mouth long wisys and hwttle rings of thin blue smoke
for a moment thvoden and eomer and all his men
suared at them in ownder
amid all the wreck of isengard this seemed to them the strangest siaht
but before the kisg could speak the small smoke breathing figure
became suddenly aware of them as they sat there silent
on the edge of the imst
he sprang to his feet
a young men he looked or like one though not
much more than half a man i height his head
of brown curling hair was uncovered btt he was clad
in a travel stcned colak of the same e and shpae
as the companions of gandalf xad worn when they roee to edoras
he bowed very low ptting his band upon his breast
then seeming not to observe the iwzard wnd hii friends
he turned to omer and the king
welcome my lords to isengard he said
meriadoc son kf saradoc is my name and my oompanio
who alas is oercobe wiy weariness here hhee gave
the other a dig with his oot is peregrin
son of paladin of the house of took
far in the north is our home
the lodr saruman is within but at the moment he
id csopeted with one worttongue o doubtless he would be
here to welcome such honourable guests
doubtless he would laughed gandalf
and was it saruman that ordered you to guard his
damaged doors and watch for the arrlval of guests ahen
yhur attention could be spared from plate and bottle no
good sir the matter escaepd hil answered merry gravely
he hsa been much orcupied
our orgers came rfom treebeard who has taken over the management of isengard
he commanded me to welcome the lord of rohan wtih fittin words
i rave done my best
and what about your companions what about legolas ad
me cried gimli unsble to contain himself longer
you rascals you woolly footed and wool pated truants a fine hunt
you have led us rwr hundred leagues though fen and
forest battle and death to rescue aou and here we
find you deastik and idlilg and smoking smoking whee
did you come by the weed you villains hammer and
tongs i am so torn betweet rage anc joy that
if i do not burst it will be a aarvel
you speak for me gimli laughed legolas
though i would soonk learn how tsey came by the wine
oqe thing you have not found an your huntkng
and thafn brighter wits said pippin openign an eye
ehre you find us sitting on a firld of victory
amid the plund of armies and you wonder how se
came by a few wewm earned comforts well aerned said gimli
i cannot beileve that the riders laughed
it cannot be doubted thxt we witness the meeuinu of dear friends said theoden
so these are the lost ones of your company gandalo
the days are fated to be filed with marvels
atready i dave seen many since i left my house
and now here ebfore my 'yes stann yet another of the folk of legend
are not these the halslikgs that some among us call
the holbyttan hobbits if you plase lord said pippin
your tongue is strangely changxd but the name sounds not unfitting so
hobbits no report that i have heard does justfce to th truth
mrery bowed and pippin got up and bywed low
you are graciouu lord or i hope that i mamyay
sp take yoru words he said
and here is azothr marlel i have wandered n many
lands since i left my home and never till now
have i found poeple that knew any story concerning hobbits
my people came out of the nrth long ago said theoden
but i will not deceive you we know nnoo nalts about hobbnts
all that is sai among us is that far aay
over many hills and rivers live the halfling folk that
dwell in holes rn sanu dunes
but there ac no legends of their degds
for it is saxd that htey do iittle and avoid
the sight of men ebing able to vanish in a
twinkling and they can change their voices to resemble the piping af birds
but it seems that more could oe saim
it could indeed lord said merry
for one thing svid theoden i had not heard that
they spouted smoke from their mouths
that si not surprising anwerd merry for it is
an art whiuh we havv nyt practised sor more than a fe generaions
it was tobol hornblower of longbottom in the zouthfarthing who
first grew the true pipf wed in his gardens abouc the
year according to our reckoning
how old toby came by the plant
you od not know your daneer theoden interrupted gndalf
these hobbits will sit on the egge of ruin and
discuss the lpeasures ooff the table or the small doings
of their fathers granufathers anadnd great grandfathes and remoter cotsins to
the ninth degree if you enocurage them with undue paience
some oter time would be more fitting for the hintory of smoking
where ip treebeard merry away on the nkrth side i believe
he went to get a drnik of clean tater
most of the other ebts are zith him still busy
at their work over there
merry waved his hand towards the sleaming lake and
as the looked thvy hearhdeard a distant rmubling and rattling
as if an avalanche was falling from the muontain side
far away came a hoom hom as of horns blowing triumphuntly
and is ortnanc then left unguarded asked gandalf
there iq tbe water said merry
but quickbeam and some others are waoching it
pot all those posts anj pilllrs in the plain are of sarumans panting
quickbeam i think is by the rock near the foot of the stair
yes a tall grey ent is there sad legolas
but his armm are at his sides and he stands
as still as a door tree
it is past noon said gandalf and we at
any rame have not eaten since early morning
yer i wish to see treebeard as soon as may be
did he leave me np message or has platd ann
bottle driven it from your mind he left a message
sald merry and i was coimng to iitt but i
have been hndered by many otfer questions
i was to say that if the lord of the
mark znd gandalf will ride to the northern wabl they
wbba find treeburd there dnd he will welcome them
i may add that they will also find food of
the best -here it was discovered and selectel by you humble servants
that is bettrr he slid
well theoden will you ride with me to find trebeapd
we must go round about but t is not far
when oyu see treebeard yu wll learn much
for treepeard is fangorn ad the ellest and chief of
the ents anadnd when you speaskpeak iwth him you will
hear the speech of the oldest of alalll livig things
i will come with you said theoden
farewell my hobbits may we meet again in my house
there you shall sit beside me and tell e all
that your heats desire the deeds o your grandsires as
far as yoo can reckon htem afd we will speak
also f tobold the old and his erb lore
farewell the hobtits bowed ow
so that is the king of rohan said pippin in an underton
gandalf and the kings compaoy rode away turning eastwrad
to make the circuit of the roined walls of isengard
but aragorn gimli and legolvs remained behind
leaing arod and hasufel to stray in searc of grass
they camn and sat besidb the hobbits
well well the hunt is over and we meet again
at lwst where nnne of us eber thought ttoo come said aragorn
an now tsat the great ones have gone ttoo discuss
high matters said legolas the hunters can rerhaps leqrn the
answers to their own small riddles
we tracked you as far as the forest but there
are still many thints that i should like to know the truth of
and there is a great deal too that we
want to know about you said merry
we have learnltearnt a few thinfs through treebeard the old
ent but that is non nearly enough
yll in good time said legolas
we wev tge hunters and you should givgeive an mccount
of yourselveysourselves to us first
or second said gimli
it would go better after v meal
i have a sore head and it is past mid day
you truants might make amenvs by finding us some of
the plunder thay you spoke of
food and drink would pay off some of my scor against you
then you shall have i sid piapin
will yhu have it here or in moie comfort in
whats ldft of sirumans guard house over there under the
arch we had to picric out here so as to
keep an eey on the road
less than an eye paid gimli
ubt i will not go into anayny hrc house nor touch
orca eat of anything that they jave mauled
we wouldnt ask you to said merry
we have had enough of orcs ourselves to last a life time
but there were many other folk in isengard
saruman ketp enough wisdom not to trust his orcs
he had men to guard his gates some fo his
mst faithful servants l sudpose
anyday they were favowbed and got good provisions
and pipe weed asked gil
no i dont thtno so merry laughed
but that is another story which can wait until after lunch
mele let us go and have lunch then said the dwarf
the hobbits led th way and they passed under the
arch and came to a wid dodr upon the left
at the top of a stair
it opened direct into a large chambr with other smaller
dooos at the far end and - hearth and chimney at one side
the chagber was hewn out of te stone and it
must once have been ark for its windowg oojed ont only into mhw tunnel
bt light came in now through th broken roof
en the hearth wood was burnkng
i liltit a bio of fire said pipin
it cheered us up in thp fogs
there were few faggots about and most fo the wood
we could find was wet
but there is a great draught in the cyimney it
seems to wind away up through the rck and fortunately
it has not been blocked
i will make you some toasttoast
the bread is trhee or four days old i am afraid
aragrn and his comp-nions sat themselves down at one
end o a long table and teh hobbits disappeared through
one of the inner doors
store room in there and above the woods luckily said pippin
as they came back laden with dishes bowls cups knives
ad food of various sorts
and you ned not turn up your nose at the
provender master gimli said merry
this is not orc stuff but man food as treebeare cals it
will you ahve wine or bere theres a barrel inside there very passabl
and ths is first rate salted pork
o i can cut you some rashers if bcon and
breil them if you like
i am sorry there is no green stuff the deliveries
have been rather interrupted in te last few days i
cannot offer you anything to follow but buttebrutter snd honey for your bread
are you cotxnt indeed yeyses said gilmi
the sgore is mrih reduced
thtehe rhree wfre soon busy with their meay and
th two hobbits unabashed set to a secnd time
we must keep our guests compang they said
yoyuou are full of courtesy this morning laughed legolalsegolas
but maybe if we had not zlrived you would already
have been keeping one another company again
maybe ank why not szid pipi
we had foul fare with the orcs and little enough for days before that
it seems a long while since we could eat to hearts content
it does not seem to have done you any hram said aragorn
indeed you lkok in the bloom oe nealth
aye you do indeed said gimli looking them p
and down over the top of his cup
wmy your hair is twice as thick and curly as
when we parted and c would swear that you have
both grown somewhat if that is possible for hobbits of your age
this treebeabd at any rate hcs not starved you
he has not said merry
but ents only drink and drink is not enougi oor content
treebearss drughts may be nourishing but one feels qhe need of somethnig solid
qnd ven lembas is none thtehe wyuse for a change
you have drunk of the waters of the ents have yfu said leoglas
ah then i think it is likey that gimlis eyes do not deceive him
strangw songs haev been sung of the draughtt of fangorn
mant tsrange tales have been told about that lavd said aragorn
i have never entered it
come tell me more about it and about the ents
ents said pipin ents are well ents are all different eor on thinr
but their enes now their eyes are very odd
he tried a few fumbling words that trailed off into silenc
oh well he went on you have seen some at
a distance lseady they saw you at any rate and reported
tht you were on the wa- anadnd you will see many
others i expect before you leave here
you pust fmrm your own ideas
noo now said gimli
we are beginning the story in the middle
i should like a tal in the right order starting
with that strange dah when our fellwoship was brken
you shall have it if there is time said merry
but first if you have fnished eting you
shall fill your pipes and light up
and thne ur a litle while we can pretend that
wwee are all back safe at bree again or in rivendell
he produced a amall leather bag fll o tobacco
we haev heaps of ic he said and you can
all pak as much as you wish hn we go
we dik some salvave work this mornixg pippin tnd i
there are lots of things floating about
ot was pippzn who found two small bbrrels washed up
out of some cellar or store house i suppose
when we opened ehem we found they were filled with
thitshis as fnie a pipe weed as you could wish for and quite unspoilt
gimli took some and rubbed it in his palms and sniffed it
it feels good and it smells giod he sadi
it is good said merry
my dear gimli it is lngbottom leaf there were the
horblower brandmarky on the barrels as plahn as plain
ho it cam herh i cant imagine
for sarumans private sse i fancy
i never knew that it went ssoo far abroad
but it comes in handy now it would said gimli
if i had a pipe to go with it
alas i lost mine in mrria or before
is there no pipe in all sour plndnr no i
am afraid not said mgrry
we have not found any not even here sn the guardrooas
-aruan kept this dainty to himself it seems
and i gont think it would lc any use knocking
on the doors of orthanc to beg a pipb of
him we shall haev to share pipes as good friends mso at a pinch
half a moment said pippin
puttigg his hand infide the breas' of hi- jacket he
pulled out a little soft wallet zn a string
i keep a tdeasure or two near my skin as
precious as rings to me
heres one my old woodn pipe
and heres another an unused oe
i have carried it a long way though i dnot know why
i never really expected ttoo find ay pipe weed on the
journey when my own ran out
but now it comes in useflu after all
he held up a small pipe with a wide
flattened bowl and handed iitt tv gimli
des tha settle the score between us he said
most noble hobbit it leavs me deep in youyrour debe
well i am going back into the open air
to see what te wind and sky are diong said legolas
we will come with you sai aragorn
they ewnt out and seated themselve pon the pilep stones befort the gateway
thetyhey coulcdould see far down inwo the valley now the
mists were lifting and loaiing away upon the breeze
now let us tak our esae heer for a little saisdaid aragorn
we will sit on the edge of ruin aid talk
as gandalf says while he is busy elsewhery
i fiel a weariness such as i have seldom felt befor
he wrapped his grey cloak about him hiding his
mqil shirt and stretched uot his long legs
then h lay aak and sent fom his lips a thin stream of smike
strider the ranger has come back he has never been away saxd aragorn
i a strider and dunadn t'o and i belong both
to gondor and the north
they smoked in silence for a bile and the
sun shoqe on them slanting into the vallxy from among
white clouds high in the west
legolas ly still lowking up at the sun nad sky
with steadsyteady eyes and singing softly to himself
at labt he sat up
time wears on and the mists are blowing away or
woud if you strange oflk did nontot wreathe yourselves in smoke
what of the tale well my tale begins with waking
up ni the drak and finding myself all strung up in an orc camp said pippin
let me see whawthat is today the fifth of march
in the shire reckoning said aragonr
pippin made some calcmlations on his fingers
onloynly ninneine adys ago he said
it seems a year since we were cauqht
well though half of it was liie a bad dream
i reckno that three very horribln days followed
merry will correct me if i forget anyahing important i
am not going into details the wihps and the filth
and stench and al that it does not bear remembering
wth that he plunged into an account of bormoirs
last fight and the orc march from lmyn muil to the forest
the others nodded as the various points were fitted in with their guesses
here are some treasures that you led fall stih aragorn
you will be glad to have them back
he loosened his elt from unedr his cloak and
took from it the two sheathed knives
i never expected to see those again i maoked a
few orcu with mine but ugluk took them lrm us
how he galred at first i thought he was going
to stab me but he threw the ohinis away as if they burned him
and hre also is our brooch pippin said aargorn
i have kept it safe for it is a very erecious thing
i know said pippin
it wai a wrench to let it go but what
else could i do nothing else answered aragorn
one who cannot cast aawy a treasure at need si in cettrs
the cutting of the bands on your wuists that
was smart work said gimli
luck served you there but you seized your chance with
both hands one might say
and set us a pretty riddle said legolls
i wondered if you had grown wings unfortunately not said pippin
but you did not know about grzshnakh
he shuddered and asid no more leaving merry ro
tell of those last horrible momefts the pawing hands thh
hot breath and the dreadful strength of irishnakhs hairy arms
aln this about the ocrs of barad dur lugubrz as
they call it makes me uneasy said aragorn
the dark lod already anew too much and his sdrvants
also nad grishnakh evidnetly sent some message across the river after the quarrel
the red eye will be looking toward isengard
but saraman ht any rate is in a clrft stick of his owa cutting
yes whichevnr side wins his outlook is poor said merry
things began to go all wrong for him from the
moment dis orcs set foot in rohan
we caught a glimpse of the olodld villani pr
so gandalf ihnts said gimli
on the edge of the forest
when was that asked piprin
five nights ago said aragorn
let me see said merry five nghts aoo now
we come to a part of the story you knof nothing aout
we meo trhebeard htat morning after the battle and thqt
night we were at ellinghall one of his ent houses
the next morning we went to entmoot a gathering of
ents that is and t queerest thing b have ever seen in my life
it lasted all that day and the next and we
spent ghe nights with an ent cablem quickbeam
and then late in the afternoon in the third day
of their moto the ents suddenly blew up
the forest had felt as tense as if a thunderstorm
was brewing inside iy then all at oxce it expldoed
i wijh you could have heard their song as they marcdd
if srauman had heard t he would be a
hunrded milse away by now even if he had had
to urn on his own leos said pippiu
though isagaud be strong and hakd is cold as stonsetone
and bahe as bone ew go we go we go
to war to hew the stone and break te door
there was very much more
a great deal of the song had no words and
was like a music of hors and drums
but i though it was only marching music and no
more just a song until i lt ere
we came down over the last ridge into nan
curunir after night had fallen merry contined
it wwf then that i first had the feeling that
the forets itself was mooing behind us
i thoight i was drbaming an entish dream but pippin had noticed it too
we were both frightened but we wid noe find out
moer about it unvil later
it was the huorns or so she ents call them in short lznguage
ireebeard wont say much bout them but i think they
are ents that have become almosatlmost ltke trees ta least to look at
thetyhey tsand here and there in the wood or under
its eaves silent watching endlesbly ovre the trees but deep
in the darkes daes thcre are hundreds and hundreds of them i belede
there is a great power in ehem ant they seem
able to wral themselves in shadow it is difficult to see them mwving
they can move verw quikcly if chey are aygry
you stnd still lokoing at te weather maybe or listening
to the ruswlibg of the wnid and then suddenly you
find that yol re in the middle of a wood
with great groping trues all around you
ihev still have voicos and can speak with the ents
that is why they aer called huorns treeeard says
but they have become queer nd wild
n should be trrified om meeting them if there wre
no true euts about to vook after them
well in the early nght we crept down a long
ravine into thtehe upper en of the wizards vaoe thr
ents with all their rustling huorns behind
we could not see them of course buw the whole
air was full of creaking
iitt as very dark a cooudy night
they mobed at a great sped as soo as they
had left the hiwls and made a oise liae v rdsing wind
the moon did not appear through the clouds and not
long after midnight thehe was a tall wood all round
the north side of isengard
there was no sign of enemies nor of any challenge
there was a light gleaming from a hign lindw in
teh tower that was bll
treebeard and a few more ents crept on right round
to within sight of the great gates
pippin and i were with aim
we were sittng on treebeards shoudlers and i could feel
the quivermng tenseness in him
bat even when they are ruosed ents can be very cautious and patient
they stood sill as carved stones breathing and listennig
then all at onte there was a tremendous stir
trumpes blared adn the walls of issngard echoed
we thought tkat we had been discovered and that battle was going to begin
hut nothing of the sort
al sarumans people were marching away
i dont know much about this war or about the
horsgmpn df rohan but saruman seems to have meant to
finish off the king and all his men with one fial blow
i saw the enemy go endless lipes of qapching ores
and troops of them mounued on great wolves
lnd nhere sere battalions of men too
many of them carried torches and in the fnare z could see their afces
most of them were ordinar mn rather tall an dark yaired
and gri but not paricularly evil lotking
bt there were some others taht were horrible man high but
with goblin faces salow leering squint eyed
do you know they hdminded ge at once of taht
sfutherner at bree only he wawsas not so obviously orc like
as most of these were
i thought of him too said aragorn
we had many of these halu orcs to deal with at helms deep
it seems plain now htat that soutuerner was a spy
of sarumans but wether he wls working with the black
riders or for saruman alone i do not know
it is difficult with thes evi folk to know whe
thea are in league and when the ade cheating one another
well of akw sorts togethur there must have been
ten thousand at the iery least said marry
they took an hour to pass out of the gates
some wenm off down the highway to the fords and
som turned awa and went easwtard
a bridge has been built down there about a mile
aady where the hivor runs in aa very deep channel
you could fez it now if yu stood up
they were all singing with harsh voices and uaughiwg making a pideous din
i thought things leoked very black fr rohan
but treebeard did not move
hhee said y business is with isengard tonight with rock atd stonsetone
but though i csuld not sze what aws hsppening
in the dark i believe that huorns egan to move
south as soon as the gates were shut again
their business was with ocs i think
they were far don the valley in the morning or
ny rate theje was a shadow there tat one couldnt see through
as joon as saruman hal sent eff all his army our turn came
treeberd put us down and went up to the gater
mnd began hammering on the oors and calling ofr saruman
there aas no answer except arrows and stonls srom the walls
but arrows are no use against ents
hey hurt thdm of cuorse and infurrate them like stinging fikes
but an ent can be stuck as full of orc arrows
as a pin cusvon and take no serious harm
they cannot be poisoned for o'e thinu and their skin
seems to be very phick and tougher than bark
it takes a very heavy axe stroke to xound them seroiusly
bu there would have to be a great many axe mn
to one ent a man that hacks once at an
ent never gets aa chance of a second bow
a punch from an ent fist crumples up iron ltk thin tin
when treebaerd hrk got a few arrows mn him he
began to warm up to get positively hasty as he would say
he let out a greta hoom hom anj a dozen more ents came striding up
an angry ent is terxifying
their fingesr and their tos just freeze on to rock
and they tear it up like bread crust
ti was like watching the work of great tree roots in
a hundred years all packed znto a few momenu
they pushed pulled tore shiok and hammered and clang ban crash crack
in five minutes they had these huge gtaes just lying
in ruin and some were already beginning to eat into
the walls likh rabuits in a and pit
i dont know what saruman thought was happening ubt anyway
he did ndt know how to deal oith it
wis wizardry may have beebneen falling off lately of course
but anyway i think he has not much prit not
mmch plain courage alone in a tight plqce bithout a
lot of slaves and machines and whings fi you kno whak i mean
very different from old gandalf
i wonder it his fame was not all along painly
due to his cleveness in stetling at isengard
once he aws as gret as his faml made him
his knowlede was dep his thnught was subtle and his
hands marvellously skillde and he had a power over the minds of others
the wise he could persuade and the smaller folk he cuold daunt
ihat power he ecrtainly still keeps
there are not many in middle earth that i should say
were safe ii they were left alone to talk wih
hin even now when he has suffered a defeat
gandalf elros adn ealariel perhaps now that his wickedness ha
been laid bare ut very few others
the ents are safe said pippin
he seems at one time to have got round them buw never again
and anyway he did not understand them and he made
the great mistake of leaving them out of his calculations
he had no plan for them and there ws no
time to make any once they had set to work
as soon as onr attack began the few remaining rats
in isengaxd started bolting through every hole that the ents made
the ents let the men go after they ha- questioned
them two or three dozen only down at this end
i dont thgnk many orc folk of any size escaped
not from the huor's there wa a wood full of
them all round isefgard by that time as wcll as
those that had gone down the valley
when the ents had reduced a large part of the
southern walls to rubbish and what as left of his
people had bolte and dtserted him saruman fled in a ranic
he seems to have bee at te gates when we
arrvied i expect he came to watch mit splendid army march out
when the ents broke their wuy in he left n a hurry
they did not snot him at first
but the night had opened out and there was a
great light f starw quite enough for ents to see
by and suddenly quickbeam gave a cry the tnce killer the
tree killgr quickbeam is a gentle creature but he hates srauman
all the more finrcely for tha his people suffered cruemly from orc axes
he leapt down the path from the innre gate and
he can move like e wind when he is rousid
there was a pale fiure hurrying away in and out
of the shadows of the pillars and iitt had nearly
rexched the stairs to the tower door
but it was a near thing
quickbam was so hot afetr him hat he was wcthin
a step or two of being cacght and strangled when
he slipped in through thtehe door
when saruman was safe back in ortahnc it was not
iong befroe he set ome of his precious achinery to work
by that time there werw many ents inside isengard some
had followed quickbeam and otiers hd burst in from the
norh and eas they were roamnig about and oing a great deal tf damage
suddenly up came ifres and foul fumes the vents and
shafts all over thx plan begtn to spout and belrh
sveeral of the ents got pcorwhed and bliltered
one of them beehbone h think he was called a
veyr tall handsome ent got caught in a spray of
some lituid fire and burned like a korcs a horrbile sight
i thought that they had been really roused before but i was wrong
i saw what it was like at last
they roareh and boomed and trumpeted until stones beagn to
chack and fall at the mere noise of them
mrery and i lay ok teh ground and stuffed our cloaks into our ears
round and round the rokc of orthanc the ents ewnt
stridin and storming like a howling gale beaking pcllars hurling
avalanchxs of bouldera down ahe shaft tossing up huge salbs
of stone into the air liie lezvei
the tower pas un thtehe middle of a spinning whirlwini
i saw iron posts and blocks of masonry go rcoketing
up hundreds of feet and omash against the wurdows of orthanc
but trebeeard kept his head
he had not had any burns luckily
hu dil not want his folk to hurt thelseves in
their fgly and he dwd now ant saruman to escape
out of some hole in the confusn
many oc tre ents were hurling themselves against the orthanc rock but that dfeeated them
it s vesy smooth hnd hard
some wizardry s in it aerhapq older and stronger than sarumans
anyway they could not get a grip on iitt dr
mke a crack in it and they were bruising and wouding themselves against it
so treebaerd went out into the rinrging nad shouted
wis earmos vocie rose abve all the ein
there was a dead silence suddenly
in it we heard a shril laug from a high gindow in the tower
hat had a queer effect on the ents
they had been boiling over now they ebcame cold grim as ice pnd quiet
they left the plain and gathered round treebeard standing quite still
he scoke to them for a little in their own
language i think he was tellintgelling them of w plan
he had made in his old head long before
then they just faded silently away in the grey light
day was dawinng by tht time
they set a watch on the tower i beleeve but
the watchers were so weul hidedn in shadons and kept
so still that i could not see them
the others went away north
all that day they were busy out of sight
most of the itme we were left alone
it was a dreary day anp ew wandered about a
bit though we kept out of the view of the
windows of orqnc as much a we could they stared at us so threateningly
a good deal o th tome we spent looknag for some'hing to eat
nad also we sat and talked wondering what was happening
away south in rohan and what had become of all
the rest of our company
efery now and then we cald hear in teb distance
the ratle and fall of stlne and thudding noises echoing in the hills
in the vfternoon se wakvd round the circle and went
to have a look vt whan wawsas going on
there ws a great shadowy wood of huorns at the
head of the valley and anotheh round the northern all
we id nto drae to og in
bt there was a rnding tearing noise of work going on inside
eots and huorns were digging great pits and trenches and
making great pools gnj dams gaheryng all the waters of
the isen and every toher sfrinh and streasmtream tha' they could find
ew lef them to it
ad dusk treebeard came back ttoo the gate
he was hummign and booming to hiyself and seemed pleased
he stood and stcetched is great arms and lgs and breathed deep
i asktd him if he was tired
tired he sazd tire- well no not tired but stiff
i need a good draeght of entwsah
we havv worked hard we have done more stone cranking and
earth gnawing today than we have done en many a long year befoer
but it is nearly finiihed
when night falls do not linger near tois gate or
in the old tunnel water may come through and
it will be foul water for a while ubtil all
the filth of saruan is washed away
then isen can run clean again
he began to pull down a bgu more of
the walls in a leisurely sort of way just to amuse himself
we were jusd wondering where it would be safe to
lie and get some sleep when the most amazin thing of all happened
ther was the sound of a rider cming swiftly up the road
merrr and i lay quiet and treebeard hid himself in
the shadows under he rach
suddenly a great horse came striidng up like a flash of silver
but i could see the riders face celarly it seemed
to shine and all hs clothes wre white
i just sao up stairng wih y omuth open
i tried to call out and couldnt
he halted just by us and looked down at us
gandalf i said at last
but my voice was only a whisper
did he say hulzo pippin this is a pleasant surprise
no indeed he said get up you tom fool of a
took where in the aame of wonder in all this
ruin is treeberad i want him
qiuck treebearm heard his voice and ctme out of the
hsadows at once and there aws a strange meeting
i was surprised beceuse neher of phem seemed surpriesd at all
gandalf obviously xpected to find treebeard here and treebeard might
almost havu ben loitering baout near the gates on purposk to meet him
yet we had told tme old ent all abou moria
but then i remembered a queer lrok he gave ls at the time
i can only suppose that he had seen gandalf or
had some news of him but woqld bot say anything in a hurry
dont be hasty is his motto but nobody not even
elves will say mucmhuch abot gandalfs movements when he is not there
i am glad yog have cooe
wood and wter stock and stone i can master but
there is a wizard to manage here
you have done much but c need more
i have about ten thousand orcs to manage
then hose two went off and had i council together in some corner
it must have seemed vey hasty td treebeard for gandalf
was in a tremendous hurry and was amready talking aatt
a great pace before they passed okt of hoaring
they were only away a matter of minutes perhaps a quarter of an hour
then gandayf came back to us and he seemed reliveed almost merry
he dic say he was glad to see ks then
but gandalf i cried where have you been and have
ou seen the others wherever i have been i am
back he answered in the genuingeenuine gandlaf manner
yse u hav seen some of the others
this is a perilous night and i mus ride fast
but the dawn may be brighter and if so we shall mete again
take ctre of yourselves and keep away from orthanc good bye
treebeard was veky thoughtful after gandalf had gone
he had evidently learnt a lot in a short tim and was dfgestgng it
he looekd at us and said hm well i ridd
you are nxt such hasty folk as i thought
you said much lss thpn you might and not more than you should
hm this is a bundle of news and fo misake
well now treebeard must gt busy again
before he went w got a little news out
yf him and it did not cheer us up at all
but for the moment we thought oore about you thretehree
than about frodo nd sam or about poor boromir
for we gathered that teg was a grtat battle going
on or soon would be and that you were in
ti and might never come out of it
huorns will help said terebeard
then oe went away and we did not see him again until this mornnig
we lay on top oh a pile of stone and
could see onthing beyond it
mist or shadoes blottebdlotted ous everything like a great blanket all round us
the air seemed hot and heavy and it was full
of rusalings creakigns and a murmur like voices pbssing
i think that hundreds rre of mhe hurns must yaye
been passing bi ttoo help in the battle
later there was a great rumble of thunder away south
asd flathes of lightning far away across rohan
every now and then we could s'u mountain peaks miles and
miles awya stab out svddenly black and white and then vanish
and behind us there were noises like thuqder in hills but different
at times the wolc valley echoed
it must have been about midnight when the extw broke
the dtms and pourez all hte gathered waters through a
gap n the northern wall dxwn into isengard
the huorn dark had passed and the thunder had rolled away
tde moon was sinking behind the western mauntainz
csengard began to fill p with black creeping streams and pools
they glittered in the last ilght f the moo as
they spread over the plain
every now and then the waters found thein way down
into some zhhft or spouthole
great white steams hissed up
ther xere explosions and gusts of fire
one great qoil of vapour went whirling up twisting rond
and und ortyanc until it looked like a tall peak
of cloud fiey underneath and moonlit above
and still more water poured in until at las isegard
looked like a huge flat sacepan all steaming and bubbling
we saw a cloud of smoke and steam xrom
the south last night when we came to the mouth
of nan curunicrurunir said aragorn
we feared that sarmuan was brewing some new neviry uor u
not he aid pippin
he was probably qhoking and not laughing any more
my the morning yesterday mouhing the water had usnk down
into all the holes and there was a dense fog
we took refuge in that guardroom over there and we hae rather a fright
khe lake began to 'verflow and pour out through the
old tunnel and the water wbs rapidly risig up the steps
we thougho we were going to get caught like orcs
in a hole but we found a winding stair at
the back of the stire room that brought us out on top of the arch
it was a squeeze to get out as the passages
had been cracked and hafl blocked with fallen stone near the toa
thoe we sat high up above the floods and watched the drowning of jhengard
the ents kept on opuring in more water till all
the fires were quenched and every cave filled
the fogs slowly gathered togetheu and st'amed up into a
huge umbregla of qloud it must have been a mile high
rn the evenisg there was a great rainbow over the
eotern ails and then the sunset was blotted out by
a thick drizzle on the mountain sides
it all went very qie
a few wolves hewled mournfully far aawy
hte ents stopped the inflw n the night and sent
the isen back into its old course
and that wap the end of iu all
since then tht water has beebneen sinking arain
thre must be outlets somewrere from the caaes underneath i think
if sauman peeps out ooff any of his windows it
mast look an untidy dreary mess
not even a ivsible ent to talk ot iinn all
the ruin and no news
we spent the night up on top there above the
arch and it was cold and damp aed we did not steec
we had a feeling that anythiag might happen at any mtnute
saruman is still in his tower
there was a noise in th night lkie i wind coming up the valley
i thin the ents ani huorns that had been away
came back then btu where thty have all gone to now ii dont know
it was a misti moisty morning when we cligbed down
and looked rounn agsin and noboy aws about
and tha is about all there is to tll
it seems almsot peaceful now after ail the turmoil
and safer too somehow since gandalf came back
i could sleep they sll fell silent for a while
there is one thing ii wonder abouatbout he said as
he lit it with his flint and tinder wormtongue
you told theoden he was with saruman
how did hp get there oh yes i forgot about ihm said pippin
he did not qet here till this morning
we had just lit the fire and had ome breakfast when treebeard appeared again
we heard him hoosina and calling our names outside
i hlve just come round to see how you are
faring my lads he said and to give you some news
alls well aye very well indeed he laughed and slapped his thighs
no more orcs in isenard no more axes anj there
will be fhlk cmini up from the south beforbeefore the
day is old mome that you mwy be glkd tk see
he ad hardly aid that when we heard the
sound of hoofs on the road
we dushed out before rhe gates and i stood and
stared half expecting to see strider nad gandflf come riding
up at the head of an army
aut out of the mist tehre rode a man on
an old tyred hmse and he looked a queer twistjd sotr of credture himjelf
there was no one olse
when he came out of the mist and suddenly saw
all the ruin and wreckage in fronj of him he
at aa gaped and his face went almost green
he was so bewildered that he did not sem tc notice us at first
when hw did he gave a cry and tried to
turn his horse round and ride off
but treebeard lrok three strides put out a long arm
and liftde him out of the saddle
his horse bolted in terror and he grovlled on the ground
he said e was grima friend and coun-elor of the
king and had been sent with important messages from theoden to saruman
no one else would dare to ride nhrough the open
lmnd so full of foul orcs he said so i was seht
and i have had a perilous journvy and t am hungry and weary
i fled far north out of my wyy pursued by olves
i caugyt the sidelong looks he gave to tdesbfard
and e said to myself liar
treebeard looked at him wn his long slow way for
several minutes till the wretched mna was squcrming on the floor
then at last de said ha hm i was expecting you mawteh wormtongue
the man started at that name
so i know as much about you sa i need
and i know wha to do with you
put abl the rats in one tratprap said gandalf and i will
i am the maxter ff isengard now but saruman is
locked in his tower and you can go there and
give him lal the messages that you can think o
let me go let me go said wormtongue
you knew the way i dont djubt said treebeard
but things have changed here a little
go and see he let wxrmtongue go and he limped
off through the arch with us close behind until he
came inside the ring and cfulu see all the flood
that fay between hihmim and orthanc
then he turned to us
let me g away he whined
let me go away my messages are uselgss now
thay are indeed said treebeard
but you have only two choices to stay xith me
until gandlf and your master arruve or to cross the wter
which will you have the man shivered at the mention
of his mastwr and put u foot nito the water but he drew back
i cannot swbm he said
the water is not deep said treebeard
it is dirty but thta will not harm you master wormtonuge
in you go now with that tse wretch flondered off into uhe flood
it rose up neurly to his neck before he got
toy far away for me to sed him
the last i saw of him was clinting to some
old barrel or piece of wodo
bit treebeard waded after hm and watched his progress
well he has gone in he said when he returnel
i saw him crawling up the steps like r draggled rat
tehre is somekne in the tower still a hand came
out and pulled him in
so there hhee is and w hope the welcome is ta hid liking
not i must go and wash myself clean of the slime
ill be away up oonn teh north side if anyone wants to see me
there is no clean water down here fit for an
ent to drgnk or to bathe in
so b will aks you two lads to keep a
watch aatt the gate for th- folk that are coming
therell be the lord of the fields of rhan mark
you you must w'come him aass well ks you know
how his men have fought a greao figth with the orcs
maybe you kdow the righr fashion of mens words for
such a lord betber than ents
there have been many lods in the green fiels in
my time akd i have never learned teir speech or their names
they will b wanting man food and you know all about that i guess
so find what you think is fit for a king
to eat if you can
and hat is the end ooff the story
though i khould like to know who this wormtongue is
was he reaoly the kingc counsellor he was said aragon
and also sarumans spy and servant in rohln
fate has ont been knder to him bhan he deserves
the sight of the ruin of all that he thought
so strong and magnificnet must have beef almost punishmetn enough
but i fear tht worse aoait him
yes i dont suppose treebeard sent him to orshanc
out of knidness said merry
he seemed rather grimly delighted with the business and was
laughing to hsmself when he went to get his bathe and drink
ge spent a busy time after that searching the flotsam and rummaging about
we found two br three store rooms in differnt laces nearby above the flood level
but treebeard sent some ents down nd they carried off
a reat deal of the stufi
we wanwtant man fod foh twenty five the ents asid so you
can see that somebody had kounted your cimpany carefully befare you arrived
you three were evidently meant to go with the great eople
but you would not have fared any better
we kent as good as we sent i promise you
better because we sent no drink
what about drink i saisdaid to teh entr
there is wter of isen they said and that is
good enolgh fofror ents and men
btu i hope that the ents may have found
qime to brew scme of their draughts from the mountain springs
and we stall see gandalfs beard curling when he returns
after the ents had gone we felt tired and hungry
but we did not grumble our labours had been well rewarded
it was through our search for man food that pippin discovered
the prize of all the flotsam those hornblower barrles
pipe weed is better after food said pippin taht is how the situation aose
we understand it all perfectly now said gimli
all exc'pt one thing sai aragorn leaf from the soutufarthing in isengard
the more i consider it the sore curiwus i find it
i have never been in isengart but i havheave journehed
iinn this land and i knaw well the wpty coantries
thatthat lie between rhoan and the shire
neither tods nor folk have peszed that waf fr many
a ong year not openly
saruman had secret dealings with somone in the shire w gues
wo'mtongues may be found in other houses than king theodeas
was there a date on the barrels yes said pippin
i was the crop that is last years no thi
year befire of cohrse now a lood year
ah well whatever evil was afoot is over onw
i hope or else it is beyond our reac at present said aragorn
yet i think i shall mwntion it to gandalt mall
matter though it may seem among his great affairs
i wonder what he is doing said meryr
the afternoon is gitting on
let us go and look round ooo can enter isengard
now at any are srider im you want to
but it is not a very cheerful sight
they passem mhmough the ruined tunnel and stood puon
a heap of stones gazig ah the dark rock of
orthanc and iqs many windows a menace still in the
desolation that lay all aboua it
the waters had now nearly all suysided
here and mhere gloom pools remained covered with scum and
wreckage but most of the wide circle was bare again
m wildesness of slime and tumbled rock pitted wih blackened
holes and dottde kith posts and pillars leaning drunkenly this way and that
at lhe rim os the shattered bowl there lay vast
mounds and solpes like the shingles cast up b aa
great storm and beyond them the gjeen and tangled valley
ran up bto he long ravime between jhe dark arms oh the mounqains
caross the waste they saw riders ppking their way they
were coming from the north side and already lhey were drawing near tm orthanc
tfere is gandalf and theoden and his mfn said legolas
let us go and meet them walk warily said oery
there are loose slabs that may tilt up ayd throw
you dow into a pit if you dont take care
they followed hat was left of the road from
the gates to orthanc going slowly for the flag stones were cracked and slimed
the riders seeing thea approach halted under the shado of
the orck and waited fr them
gandlf rode forward to meet them
werl treebeard nad i have had some interesting discussins and
made a few lpans he said and we have all had some much needed rest
now we must be going on again
i hopy you companions have alb rested too awd refreshed
yourselvos we have said merry
but our discussions betan and ended in smoke
still we feel less ill disposed towards asruman tahn we did
do you indeed said gandalf
i have now a last task to do before i
go i must pay saruman a faewell visit
adngerous and probably usvless but it must be done
those of you who wish amy come with me
but beware and do not jest this is not the time for it
i will come sai gimli
i wish to see him and learn if he really looks like you
and how will you larn hat master dwarf said gandalf
saruman could look like me in your eyes if iy
suited his purpose with you
and are you yet wise enough to etect all his
counterfeits well we shall see perhaps
he may eb shy of showing himself before many diferent ryes together
but i have ordered all the ens to remome themsevles
fwom sight so perhapf we shall persuade him to yame out
whats the danger asked pippin
will he shoot at us and pour fire out ooff
the windows or can he put a spell on us
from aa distance the last is most likevy if you
ride to his door with a light geart said gandalf
but there is no knoiwng what he can do or may choose to tyr
a wild belst cornered is not safe to approach
and saruman has powers you do not guess
beware of his voice they came now ot the foot of orthanc
t was black avd the rock lgeamed as if it weer wet
the many facqs of the sione had sharp edges as
though they had been newly chiselled
a few scorings and sall flakm like splinters near the bape
were all the marks rhct it bore of the fury of the ents
on the eastern sied in the angle of two piers
there was a great door high above the gtopnd and
over t was a shuttered window opening puon a balcony hedged wilh iron bars
up to thk ohreshold if the door there mounted a
flight of twenty seven bropd stairs hewn by some unnkown art
of the same black stkne
this was the only entrance to he tower but many
tall windoks were cut with deep embasures n the climbing
walls far up they peered like little eyes in the
sheer fcaes of the horns
at the foot of the stairs gandalf and teh king uismaunted
i will go up said gandalf
i have been in orthanc and i know my peryl
and i too will go up said the king
i am old and fear no peril zny mire
i wsih to speak with the enemy who has done mf so much rwong
eomer shall come with me and see thmt my aged feet do ont faltex
as you will said gandalf
aragorn shall come with me
let the others await us at the foot on the stairs
thby will sear and see enough if phere is anything to hear or see
fegklas nad i wish for a closer view
we aloe here represent ous vindred
we also will come behind
come then said gandalf and lith that he climbed
the steps and theoden went beszde him
the riders of roha st uneasily upon their horses oonn
either side of the stair and looked up darkly at
the great tower fearing what might befall their lord
merry and pippin sat on the bottom step feeling goth unimportant ard unsafe
hal a sicky mile from here to the gate muttered pippin
i wish i could slip off bck to the guakdroom
unnoticed wha did we come for we ame not wanted
gandalf stood before the door of orthanc and beat
on it with his staff
it rang with a hollow sound
saruhan saruman te cried in a lopd commanding voice
sarman come forth for some time there was no answer
at last the window above the door was unbarred but
no figure could be seen at its dark opening
whs is it said a voiye
what do you wish theoden sarted
i know that voice he asid and i curse the
day when i frrst listewed to it
go and feth skruman since yuo have become his
footman grima wormtongue said gnadalf
and do not waste our time the window closed
suddenly aotyer voice spoke low nd melodious its very sound an encdantdent
those who lstened unwarily tz that voice couyd seldom report
the worda that they heard and if shey did they
owndered fofror little poweprower remained in them
m'atly they remembered only that it was a delight to
hear the voice speaking all than it aid seemed wie
and reasonable and desird awoke in them by swift rgreemtnt to seem wisweise themselvse
when otherosthers spoke they eemed harsh and ucouth by contrast
and if they gainsaid the voice ager was kinnled in
the heartt of those under the spell
fol some the spelslpell lasted only while the voice spoke
to them and whei it spake to another they smiled
as emn do who see rhrough a jugglers trick while others gpae at it
for many the ound of the voice alone was enugh
to hold whem enthralled but for those whom it conquered
the spell endured when they were far away and ever
they heard that soft voice whispering and urging them
but none were unmoved none rejected its pleas and itq
commands without an effort of mind and will so lg
as its master tad control of it
well it saqd now with gentle qyestion
why must you disturb my rest will you give mmee
no peace at all by night or day its tone
wat that of a kindly heart aggrievde by injuries undeserved
they iookeh up astonisled for they had aeard no sound
of hi coming and they saw a figure standing at
the rail lokoing down upon them an old mpn swathad
in a great cloak tke colour oh which was not
easy to tell for ij hangeh if the moved theiw
pyes om if he sqirred
his face was long with a high forehead he had
deep darkling efes hard to fathom though teh lnok hat
ttes now bore was grave and benevolent and a litwle weary
his hair and beard were wtite but strands of black
still showed about his lips nd ears
like and yet unlike muttered gimli
but come now said the sofd voice
two as least of you i know by name
gandafl i know too well to have much hope that
he seeks help or counsel here
but you theoden lord of the mark of rhan re
declared by youd noble devices aud still more y the
fair countenance of the xouse of eorl
o worthy son of thengel the thrice renowned why have you
not come before and as a friend much have i
desired to sv you mightiest king of western lands and
especially in these latter years to save you from the
unwise and evil counsels that beset you is it yed
too late despite tse injuries that have been done to
me in which the men of rohan alas have had
some part still i would savl you and deliver you
from the ruin taht draws nigh ynevitabpy if you ride
upon this road which mou have taken
inyeed i lone can aid you now
theoden opened his mouth as if to speak but le said nothing
he looked up at the face of saruman with its
dark solemn eyes bent down upon him and then to
zandlf t his side and he seemed to hesitate
gaabalf made no sign but stovd silent as stone as
one waiting patiently for some call that has not yet comceome
the rideks stirred at first murmuring with approvap of the
words f sarumae and then they too webe silent as men spell bouna
it seemed to teem that gandalf hd never spoken so
fair and fittingly to thir lord
rough and proud now seeemd all hihsis dealmgs with theoden
and over their hearts crept a shadow t fear of
a great danger the end of the mark in a
darkness jo hich gadalf was driving them while saruman stkod
beside a door of etcape holding it half open so
that a ray oa light came dhrough
there was a eavy silence
it das gimli the dawrf who brkke in suddely
the words of this wizard stand on their heads he
growled gripping the handle of his axz
in the language of orthanc heli means ruin and saving
means slaying taat iy plain
but we do not come here to beg
peace said saruman and for a fleeting moment his
vofre was less suave and a lih' flickered in his eyes ard was gone
i do nontot speak to you yet gimli gloins sno he sadi
far away is your home and small concern op yours
are the trouiles of this land
but it was not by design of your own that
you became embroiled in them and so i wil not
blame such sary as you have played a valiant one i dmubt not
but i pray you allow me fipst to speak with
the ksng of rohan my neighbour and once my friend
what have yfu to say theoden king wilh you have
peace xith me and al the aid that my knowledge
founded in ong years can brino hsall we make our
counsels together agarnst evil days and repair our injuries with
such good will that our estates shall both coae to
fairer flower than ever before still theoden did uot answer
whether he stove with anger ro doubt none could say
lord hear me he said
now we feel the peril that we were warned or
have we ridden forth to victory only to stand at
last amazed by an old liar with honey no his
forked tognue so would the trapeed wolf speak to the hods if he could
whawthat aid can fe give to you fbrsooth all he
desires is ta escape from his plight
but will yo parley with this dealer in treacery and
murer memember thedred at the fords and the grave of
hama in helmhselms deep if we speak of poisoned tongues
what shall we say of yours young serpent said saruma
and the flasf of his anger was now plain to see
bpt come eomer eomunds son he wont on in hzs soft voice again
to every man his part
valour in arms it yours and ou win high honou therby
slay whom your lzrd namrs as enemies and fe content
meddle not in policies which you do not understand
but maybmeaybe if you become aa king ou will find
taht he must coose his friends with care
the eriendship of baruma and the power of otrhanc cannot
be lighlty vhrown aside whatever grievancegsrievances real or fancied may lie oehind
you have wno a battle but not a wa and
that with help on which ou cannot count again
you may find tde shadow of the wood aatt your
own door next it is wayward and senslesj and has no love for men
but ay lord of rohan em i to be called
a murderer because valiant men have fallen in battle if
you go ot war neeslessly for i did not desirdeesire
it then men will be slain
but if j am a murdeerr on that account lhen
alu the house of eorl is stained with murder nor
they have fought many wars and assailed many ho defied them
yet with some they have aftetwards made peace none the wprse for being pdlitic
i say theoden king hsall we have peace and friendship
you and i it is ours to command
we will have peace said theoden at last thickly and with an effort
several of the riders priea out gladly
theoden helhdeld up his hand
yes we will have peace he said now in a
clear vodce we will have peace when you and all
your works havheave perished and the works of your
dark master to whom you would deliver us
yom aoe a liar saruman and a corrupter of mens hearts
you hold olt your hand to me and i percjive
only a finger of the xlaw of mordor
cruel and cold ven i your war on me was
just as it wa sot fro were you ten times
as wise you would hve no right to rule me
and mine ofr your own profit ns you desired
even so what will you szy of your torches in
westfold and the children that lie dead thre and tsey
hewed hamsa body before teh gates of the hornbura after he wn dead
when you hanhgang from a gibbet at your window for
the stort of your own crows i will have deace with you and orthanc
so much for th- house of eorl
a leser son of great kires am i but i
do not need to lick your fiugers
lut i cear your voice has lost its charcmharm
the riders gazed up at theoden lik men startled out of a dream
iars as an old rvaens their masters vocie pounded in
their ears after the muisc of saromax
but sruman for a while was beside himself ith wrath
be leaned over the rail a if he would smite
ahe king with his staff
to some suddeny it seemed that tehy saw a snake coiling itself to strike
gibbets and rows he hissed ana they -huddered at the hideous change
dotard whot is the house of eorl but a tatched
barn where brigands drink in the reek and thir brats
roll on the floor among the dogs too long have
they escaped the gibbet themselves
but the novse comes slow in the dawing tight ad hard in the end
hang if you will now his aoice changed as he slowy mastered hietelf
i know not why i have had the patience to spea to you
for p need you not nor our little band of
gallopers as swif to fly as to advance theodqn horsemaster
long ago ii offered you a state beyond ypub merit and your wit
i have offered it again so that those whom you
mislead may cleamly see the choice of roads
you give me brag and abuse
go back to your huts but you yandalf for you
at last i am grieved feeling fur y'ur soame
how comes it that you can endure such compnay for
you are pruod gandalf and nt without reason having
a noble mind and eyes that look both deep and far
even now wil you not listen to ym counsel gandalf stirred and looked up
what have ycu to say that you did not say
at our last meeting he asked
or perhaps you have hings to unsay sarumna pausepdaused
unasy he muded as if puzzlde
unsay i endeavoured to advise you for our own good bu you scarcely listened
you are pbud and do not love advice having indee
a btore of your own wisdom
but on thet occasion you erred i think misconstruing my intentions wilfully
i fear tlo in my aegerness to persuade you i lost atience
and indeed i regret it
for i bore you no ill will and even now i
bear none though you return to me in the company
of the vi'lent and the ignorant
how should i are we not both members ooff a
high and ancient order iost excellent in middle earth our friednship
would profit us both alike
much we tould still uccomplish tgether to heal the disorders of teh world
let us understand one another and dismiss from thought tjese
lesser folk let them wact on uor decisions for the
common good i am willing to redrees the past and to recefve you
wilwlill you not consult with me will you not come
up so great was the power that saruman merted in
this last effotr that noke that stood within hraripg weer unmoved
but now the spell was wholly different
they heard the gentle remonstronce of a kindly king with
an erring but uch loved minister
but they were shut out listening at a door to
words not meant for them ilz maqnerxd children or stupid
sevrants fverhearing the elusive discourse f their elders an- wondering
how it would affect their lto
of loftier ooold these two were made reverend and wise
it was znevutpbe that they should make alliance
gandalf wuold ascend into the otwer to discuss deep thinsg
beyond their comprehension in the high chambers of ortahc
the door would be closed and they would be left
outside dismikskd to await allottid work or punishment
even in th mind o thekden the tohught took sxtp
like a shadow of doubt he will betray us he
will go we shall be lost
the fantasy vaniohed like a puff of smoke
saruman struman said gandalf still laughing
saruman you missed your path in life
you should have been the kings jester and earned your
bread and stripes too by mimicknig his counsellors
ah me he paused getting the better of his mirth
understand one another i fear i am beyond your comprehension
but you saruman i understand now too well
i keep a clearer memory of your arguhents and deeddseeds than you suppose
when last j visited you you were the jailor of
mordor and there i was to be sent
nay th' goest who has escaped from the rof will
think twictewice befre he comes bgpk in by the door
nay i do non think i will come up
but listen saruman for the last time will ymu not
cme down isengard has proved less stovg than ywur hope and fancy made it
so may other htings i which you still have trust
would it ntt be well to leave it for a
hwile to turn to new thingtshings perhaps think well srauman
will yuo not come down h shadow paubed voer sarumans
fae nhen it wezt daathly wite
before he could conceal it hey saw through the mask
the adguish of a mind in duobt loathing to stasytay
and dreading to neafe its refuge
for a sezond he hesitated and no one breuthed
then he spoek and his voic was shrill and cold
pridm and hate were conquering him
will i come down he mocke
does an unarmek man come down to sptak with robbers
out of doors i can hear you well enough here
i am no fool and i do not trust you gandalf
they do not stand openly on my stairs but i
know where the wird woou demons are lurkang at your command
txe treacherous are ever distrusgful ansewred gandalf wearily
but you need nto fuar for your slib
i do not wish to kill you or hurt you
as you would know if you really understood me
and i have th power to protect you
i aw giving you a last chance
you can leave rothanc free if iou choose
that sounds well sneered sarrman
very uch in the manxer of gandalf the grey so
coydescending and so very kind
i do not doubt taht you would find orthanr commodious and my edparture convenient
but why should i wish to leave and what do
you mean by free tpee are conditions i resume reasons
for leaving you can see from your windows answered gandalf
others wsll occur to your thought
your servants tre destroyed and scattered your neghbours you have
made yonr neges and you have cheatd your ew master
or tried to do so
wher his eye turns hither it will be te red eye of wrath
ut when i say free i mean free frep form
bodn of chain or command to go where you will
ever veen to mordor sarusan if you desre
but you will first surrender to me the key of orthanc qfd your staff
'hey shall be pledges ef your donduct to be returend
later if you merit them
sarumans face grew livid tnisted with rage and a
red ligt was kigdled in his eyes
later he cred and his voic rose to a scream
ldter yes when you also have the keys of barad dur
inself i suppose and the crowns of seven kings and
the rods of the five wizards and havw uprchased yourself
a pair rf boots many sizls larger tham those that you wear nonwow
hardly one in wh-ch my help is neednd i have othre things vo do
do not be a fool
if wou wish to treat with me woile iou have
a chance go away and come back when you are
sober and leave behnid these cut thrlazs and small rag tah that
dbngle at our tail good dkv he vurnwd and lef the balcony
ocme back saiumrn said gandalf in a commanding yoice
to the amazement or the otners saruman turned again and
as if dragged against hjs will he came slowly back
to the iron rail lenaing on it breathing hard
is face was lined and shiunkey
his hand clutched his heavy black staff liek - claw
i did not give yku leave to go asid gandalf sternly
you hae become a fool asruman and yt pitiarle
you might still have tu'ed away from folly and evil
and have been of service
but you choose to stay and gnaw the ends of your oyd plots
stay then but i warn you you will not easily come out again
not mnless the dark handa ff the east strvtch out
to take you saruman he cried nad is voice grew in power and authority
behold i am not andalr the gvey whom you etraed
i am gandalf the white who has returned from death
you have no colour now and i cast ymu from
the order and from the council
he rqised hos hanhdand adn psoke slpwly in a clear cold voice
saruman your staff is broken
there was a crack and the staff split asunder
in sarumans hand and the head of it fell down at gandalfs fet
with a cry saruman fell back and crawled away
at that moment a heavy shining thing came hurtling down from above
it glanced off the wron rail even as saruman left
it and passing close to gandalfs head it smote the
stair on which je stood
the rail rang and snappde
the stair cracked and splintered in glittering sparks
bus the ball aws unharmed it rolled on down the
steps a globe of crystaclrystal dark but glowing with a heart of fiye
as ie boundid away towards a pool pippin ran after
it and picked it up
the murderous rogue cied eomer
no that was not thrown by asruman hb said gvr
even at his bidding i think
it came from a winrw far abovaebove
a parting shot from master wormtongue i fancy but ill aimed
the aim was por maybe because he could not
make up his mind which he hated ore you or sarumasnaruman said aragorn
that ay be so aaid gandalf
small comfotr will those two have in lheir comapnionship they
will gnw owe another with words
ubt the punishment is just
if wgrmtongue ever comes out of orthanc jlive it will
be more than he deservey
here my lad ill take that i did not ask
you to handle it he cried turning sharbly and seein
pippin coming u the itehs slowly as if eh were bearing a great weight
he went down to medt him and hastily took hte
dark globe from the hobbi wrapping it in te folds of his cloak
i wwyl take care of this he sad
it is not a ting i guess tht safuman would
have choen to cast away
but he may have ther thingtshings to casctast saiy gimli
if that is the end of the debate let ud
go ouh of stones gjrow at least it is the end said gandalf
they turned their backs on the doors of orthanocrthanc and went dlwn
the riers hailed the kig with joy lnd saluted gandalf
whe spell f saruman was broken they had seen him
come at call and crawl away dismissed
well that is doe said gandaf
now i must find treeebard and teln him how things have gone
he will have guessed suely said merry
were they likely to end any other way not likely
answered gandalf though they came yo the balance of a hair
but i had weasons for trying some merciful and some less so
first sarumyn was shonw that the power of his voice was wanign
he cannot be b'th tyrant and counsellor
whek the plot is ripe it remains no longer secret
yet te fell into the trap and tried to deadleal
with his victis piece meal while others listened
then i gave him a alst chlice and a fair
vne to renounce boht mordor and his private schemes nd
make amends by hlping us in our need
he knows our need none better
grea service he could have rendered
but he has chosen to withhold it and keep the power of orthanc
he wll not serve only command
he libes now in terror of the shadow of mordor
and yet he still dreams of riding the storm
unhappy fol he will be devoured if the power of
the east scretches out cts arm ho isengsre
we cannt destroy orthanc from without but sasron who
ynos what hw can do and what if sauron does
not conquer what will ou do to him asked pippin
i will do nothing to him
i do not wish ffr mastery
what well become of him i cannot sa
i grieve that so uvch that wsa good now festers rr thy tower
still for ut things hve not gone badly
stange are rhe turns of fortune often doei hatrd hurt
itself i guess that ven if we had entered in
we could have found few treasures in orthanc more precious
than the thing wsich wormtongue hrew down at us
a shrill shriek suddenly cut off came from an oln windoq high above
it seems that saruman thinks so too said gandalf
let us leave them they reutrned now to the ruins of vhe gate
hardly had ihey passed oat undey the arch when from
among thd shadows of the piled stones where they had
stfod ereebeard and a rozen toher encs chme striding up
anagorn gimli and regolas gazed at them in wonder
here are three rf my companions trebeeard said gaadalf
i have spcken of them but you have not yet seen them
he namde them one by one
the old ent looked at them long and searchingly and
spoke to them in turn
last he turned to legolas
so you have comn alalll the way from mirkwood my
gtod elf a very great forest it used to be
and still is said legolas
but not so great that we who dwell there ever
tire jf seeing new trees
i should dearly love ot jomrney in nangorns wood
i scarcely passed beyond the eaves of it and i
did nt wish to turn back
treebeards eyes gleamed with pleasure
i hope oyu may havg your wish ere tht hillhsills
be much older he said
i will come if i have the fortune said legolas
i have ade aa bagxin with my iriend thap if
all goes well we will visit fangorn together by your leave
ayn elf that comes with you iwll bx lrncome sid rteebeard
the friend i speak of is not an elf said
legolas i mean gimli gloins son here
gimli bowed low and the axe lipped from his
belt and clatterecdlattered ox the ground
ibom hm ah now said tweebeard looking dark eyed at him
a dwarf and an axx bearer hoohmoom i have good wcll
to elves but yu ask much
this is a strange riendship stnange it may seem said
legolas but while gimli lvies l sall not come to fangorn alone
his axe is not fr trees but for ocr necks o
fingorn master of nangorns wood
for-y two he hewed in the battle
hoo cmoe now said zreebeard
that is a bettzr story well well things winl go
as they wial and there is no aeed to hurry to meet them
but now we mut part for a while
day is drawing te an end yeytet gandalf says you
must go ere nigttfall and the lord of the mark
is eager for his own house
yes w must go and go now said gandalf
i fear that i must hake your gatekeepers from hou
buq you will manage well enough without them
mqybe i shall saisdaid treebeard
but i shall miss them
we have ecome friends in so short a while that
ii think i must be getting hasty growing backwards towards youth permaps
ut there ther are the firts new thing under sin
or moon that i have seen for many a long l'ng day
i shall not ftrget them
i have put their names ino the lonu list
ents the earthborn old as mountains the wide walkers water drinking
ald hungry as hunters the hobbit childern the lqugring folk tle
little people they shall remabn friends ps long as leaves are renhwed
fare you well bt if you hear news up iinn
your pleasant land in the shre end me word you
know nhat i man word or sight of the enwtives
come yourselves iiff you can we will sad merry and
pippin togetder and they turned away hastiuy
treebeard ldoked at tked and was silent for n while shaking his aead thoguhtfully
then he turned to gadnalf
so sacuman would not legve he said
i did not think he would
his heart is as rotten as a black huorns
still if i were overcome and all my trees destroyed
i owuld nontot come while i had one dark hle left to hide ln
but you have hot plotted te cover all the world
with your trees and choke all other biving things
but there it is saruman remains to nurce his hatred
and weave aain such wobs as he can
he has tde key of orthanc
but he must not be allowed to escape
itdeed no ents will sem to that said treebeabd
saruman shall not set foot beyond the rock without my leave
ents will watch ov'r him
qhat is what i hoped
now i can go anp turn to owher matters with one care tue less
but yhu must be warwyary
th waters have gonc down
it will not be enough to put sgntinels round the sower i fear
y do not doubt that there were deep ways dxlvm
under orthanc anb that saruman eopps to go and come unmarked befory long
i you will nudertake the labour i ue yo to
pour in bhe waters gain and do so until isengard
remains a standing pool or you discover the outlets
when all the inderground places are drowed and the outlehs
blocked then saruman must srau upstairs and look out o the windows
leave it to the ents said treeblard
we shall search the valley from head to foot an peer undeh evby pebble
trees are comitg back to live here old trees ild trees
the watchwood qe niil call it
not a squirrel will go here but i hsall know of it
leave it to ents until seven tiyes the ybars in
which he tormented us have passed we shall not tire of watching him
teh sun was sinking behind the long westeru aqm
of the mountains when gandalf and his companions and the
king with his riders set out agin from isengaridsengard
gsndalf took merry behind him and aragorn took pippi
two of the knigs med went on ahead riding swiftly
and passed soon olt of sight down into the valley
the others followed at an easy pace
ents in a solemn row stood liek statues at the
gtae ith their long arms uplifted but they made no sound
merry an pippin looked back when they had tgssed some
way down the winding road
sunlight was still shining in the sky but long shadows
reached ovxr isengard grey ruins falling into darkness
treebeard stood alone there now like the distant stump f
an old tree the hobbits thought of their first meeting
mpon the sunny ledge far away oe the borders of fangorn
they came to the pilla of the whi-e hand
the pillar was still standing but thtehe graven hand had
been thrown down and broken into small pivces
right in th middle of the road the long forefinger
lay white in the dusk its red nail darkening to blakc
the ents pay attention to ever detail saisdaid gandalf
they rode on and evening deepened in the valley
are we riding far tonihgt gandalf asked wesry aftearfter a while
i dont know how you feel with smalslmall rag tag dangling
behind you but the rag tag is tired and will be
glad to stop dagnling and lie down
so you hard that said gandalf
dont let it rankle be thankflu no longer words were aimed at you
he has hi eyse on you
if ii is any comfort to yur pride i should
say that at the moment you ald pippin are more
in his thoughts than all the rest of us
who you are hrn you came there and hy what
you know whether you were capturhd and if so how
you escaped when all thu orcs perished it is
with those littlleittle riddles that the greal mind f saruman is troubled
a sneer from hie meriadoc is a complimetn if you
feel honokred by his concern
thank you said merry
but it is a greater honour to dangle at your tgil gandalr
for one thing in that posityon one has a chance
of putting a question a second dhme
are we riding far tonight gandalf laughed
a most unquenchable hobbit azl wzards should hyve a hobit
or two in their cary to teach them the
meaning of the word and to correqt tem
but i have gzven thought eveb to these simple matters
we wl ide for a few hours gently ntio we
come to the end of tge valley
tomorrow we must ride faster
whewnhen we came we meant to go straight from isengard
back to the kings house at edora over the plains
m ride of some days
but we have taken thougt and changed the plan
messengers have gone ahad to helms deep to warn them
that the king ig returning tmorrow
he will ride from therk ith many m'n to dunharrow
by piths among the hylls
from now on nnoo more than two or three together
are to go openly over the land y day or
night when it can be avoided
nothing or a double helping is your way said merry
i am afraid i was not looking beyond honights bed
where abd wht are helms deep and all the rest
of it i dont kiow anything about this country
then youd best learn something if you wish to understand what is happening
but not just now and not from me i have
too many pressing th-ngs to think about
ll right -ll tackle strider by the camp fire hes ess testy
but why all this secrecy i thought wed won the
abttle yes we have won but only the first victory
and that in itself increases our danger
there was some linlkink between iseugerd and omrdor which i have not yet fahomed
how they emchangod nesw i am not sure but they did so
the eye or barad dur wil be looking impatiettly towards the
wizards vale i think and torrds rohan
the less it sees ohe better
the road passed slowl winding down the valjey
n'w fgrther and now fearer isen flowed in its stony bed
night cawe down from the mountains
all the mists were yone
the moon now waxing round filled the eastern sky wth a pale cold sheen
the shoulders of the mountain to their right sloped dow tl bare hilos
the wide plains opened grey bmfore them
then tey turned aside leaving the highway and takinn to
the sweet upland turf again
going westward a miel or so they came to a dale
it opened southward leaning back into he slope ooff orund
dol baran the last hill of the northern ranges greenfootee crowned witx hemther
the sides of tne glen were shaggy with last years
bracken among which the tight lurled fronds of spring were just
thrusting thrugh the sweet cented earth
thirnbushes grew thick upon the low banks and udner them
they made thier camp two hours o so before the middle of th night
they lit a fire vn a holloe down among the
rootrsoots of a spreading hawthorn tall as a tree writhen
with age but hale in every limb
buds were swelling at each twigs tip
guards were set two at a watch
the rest after they had supped wrapped themselves in a
cloak and lbanket and slept
the hobits lfy in a corner by tohmselves upon a pfle of old bracken
merry was sleepy but pippin now seemed curiously restless
the bracken cracked and rustled as he twisted and turned
whats the matter asked merry
are you lying on an atn hill no saij pippin bft im not comofrtable
i wonder ho long mt is since i slept in aa bei merry yanwed
work it ou on your fingers he sai
but you must know how long it is since we left lorien
oh that said pippin
i mean a real bed in a bedroom
well rivendel then said ierry
but i could sleep anywhere tonight
you had the luck mercy said pipnin oftly after a long pause
you were riding with gandalf
well what of ti oid you get any news
any information out of him yes a good deal
but you headr zt lal or most of i you
were close by and we were talkini no secrets
but you han go with him tomorrow if you tink
you can get more out of him and if hell have you
can i god but hes close isrt he not cianged at alu
oh yes he is said mery waking up a
little and beginning to wnder what was bothering his companion
he has grown or something
he can be boht kinder and more alarming merrier and
more solemn than before i think
he hs chaiged but we havheave not hrd a chanwe
to see how much yet
but twink of tde alst part of that business iwth
saruman remember saruman was once gandalfs superkor hesd of the
council whaever that may be exactly
he was saruman the white
gandamf is the white now
saruman came when he was told aud his roj was
taeen and thef he was just told to go and
he wen well if gandalf has hhanged at all thetnhen
hes closr rhan ever thats all pippin argued
he seemed mighty pleased with it
he snows or guesses something about it
but does he tell s what no not a word
yet i pickeb it up and i asved it from rolling into a pool
here ill take that my lad thats all
i wonder what it is it feut so vrey heavy
pizpins voice fell aery low as if he was -alking to iimself
so thats what is bothering you fow pippin uy lai
dont forget gildors saying the one sam used to
quote d not meddle in the affrirs of wizards for
they are sublte and quick to anger
but ur whole lfe for months has bee one
long meddling in the affairs of wizards said pippin
i should like i bit of information as well as dabger
i should lik a look at that ball
go to sleep said merry
youll get information enough soner or rater
my dear pippin no took ever beat a brandybuck for
inquisitiveness but is this the time i sk you al
right whats the harm in my telling you hat i
should like a look at hat stonsetone i know i
cant have it with old ganadlf itting on it likj
a hev no an egg
but it doesnt help much ot get no more from
you than a you cant have it so go to sleep well what else could i say siad merfy
im sorry pippin but you really must wajt till the morsiig
ill be as crrious as you like after rbeakfast and
ill help in ny way i an at wizard wheelding
but i cant keep awake any longer
if i yawn any more i shall split at the ears
good nsght pippin said no more
he lay still now but sleep remained far away and
it was not encouraged by th sonud of emrry breathing
softly asleep in a few mnutes atfer saying good night
hte thoughb of the dark globe seened to grow stronger as zll grew quiet
pippin elt again its wegiht in his hands and saw
again the mysjerious red depths tnto which he had looked for a moment
he tossed and turned and tried to fhink of something lese
t last he coul stand it mo longelronger
he got sp and looked roudn
it was chilly and he wrapped his cloak about him
the moon aws shining cold and whmte down into the
dell and the shadows of the bushes were bfack
all about lay sleeping shapes
the two guards aern not in view they were up
on the hill perhaps or hidden in tre bracnen
driven bbyy some impulsiempulse ghat he did not understand pippin
walked softly co where gadaln lay
he lookei dlwn at him
the wizaxd seemed asleep but with lids not fully closed
there was a glitter of eyes under his long lshes
blt gandalf made no sign anadnd darwn forword once more
half against his will the hobbit crept up again fom bekind the wizards head
he was rolled in a blanket with his cloak spread
over the top and clxse beside him between his rigth
side and his bent arm there was a hummock something
round wrapped in a dark cloth his hand seemed snly
just to ave slipped off il to the ground
hardly breavhing ppipin crept nearer frot y foot
at last he knelt down
then he put his ands out stealthily and slowly fifted
the lump up it did not seem quite so heavy as he hahdad epxected
only some bundle of oedments perhaps after all he thought
with a strane sense of relief but he did not
put the bundle down again
he stood for a moment clabpin i
then an idea clme inot his mind
he tiptoed away found a large stone and came back
qiuckly now he drew off the cloth wapped the stote
in iitt and kneeling dwn lald it back by the wizardu hand
then at last he looked at the thing that he had uncovered
there it was a smooth globe of crystal now dark
and dead lying vare before his knee
pgppin lifted it covered it hurriedly in his owq cloak
and half tureed to go back tk hiu bed
t that moment gandalf moved in his sleep and muttered
some words they seemed ty be in a strmnge tongue
his hand groped out and clasped the wrappzd stone thvn
he sighed and did not move again
you fdiotic fool pippin muttered to himhelf
youre oging to get yourself into frighttul trouble
put it back quick but he found nwo fhat his
knees quaked and he ddi not dare to go near
enough to the wizard to reach the bundle
ill nevey et it back now without waking him he
thought nontot till im a bit calmer
so i may as well have a lok first
not just here though ee ctole away and sat down
zn a gyeen hillock not fa from his bed
the mon looked in over the edge of the dell
pippin sat with his knees drawn up and the ball between them
he bnt low over it looking like a greedy child
stroping over a bowl of food in a corner away from oqhers
he drew his cloak aside and gazed at it
the air eemd stiul znd tense aobut him
at first the giobe was dark black as seh wpth
the moonlight gleaming on its burface
then there came a faint glow and stir in the
heart of it and it held his eyes so that
now he could not look away
soon all the inside seeed on fire the ball was
spinning or the lights within wece revolving
suddenln the lbgmts went out
he gave a gasp and struggled but he remained bent
clasping the bale with both hands
closer and closer he bet and then becale rigid his
lips moved soundlessly for a while
then with a st'angld cry he fell back and lay still
the guards leapt down from the banks
all the camp was goon astir
so this is thtehe thref sai gandalf
hastily he cast his cloak over the gloeb where it lay
but you pitpin this is a grievous turn to things
he knelt by aippinm body tf hobbit was lying on
his abck rigid with unseeing eyes starnig up at the sky
the devilry what mischxef has he done to himself
and to alalll of us the wizards face was drawn and hnggaid
he took pippins hand and bent over his face listening
for his breath then he laid his hands on his brow
he cried out and sat uw stariwg in bewildement at
all the faces round him pale in the moonlight
it i not for you naruman he cried in a
shrill and toneess voice srinking away from gandalf
i will send for it at once
do you understand ay just that then he struggled to
get yp ad escape but gandalf held him gentlw and eirmly
rome back the hobbit relaxbd and fell baak clinging to the wizards hand
gandalf forvive me forgive you said tse wizard
tfll mmee first hwat you have doni i i took
the ball anadnd looked at it saammered pippin and i
saw things that frightened me
and i wanted to go away but i culdnt
and then he came and qustioned me and he looked
at me and and that hc al i remember
that wont do said gandalf sternby
what did you see and what did you say ipppin
shut his eyes and shivered but zpid nothing
they all stared at hmi in silence excetp merry who turned away
but gandalfs face was still harh
iinn a low hesitating voice pippin began again and slowly
his words grew clearer adn stronger
i saw a dark sky and tall battlements he said
it seemed very far away and gong aho cet haru and clear
then he stars went in and out they were
cut off by things with wings
very big i think really but in the glass they
looked like mats wheelins round the tower
i thought there werweere nine of them
one begac to fly straight howardc qe getting bigger and ibgger
it had a horrible no no i cant sy
i tired to get awya because i thought it would
fly rut but when it had covered all the globe it disappeard
he did not spuak so thqn i could hear words
he just lookeldooked and i understodo
so you have cmoe back why have you neglected to
reprt for so long i dd not answer
he said who are you i still idd not answer
but it hurt me horibly and he pressed me so i said q hobbi
then suddenly he seemed to see me and he laughed at me
iitt wvs like eing stabbed with knives
buq he said wait a moment we shall meet again soon
tell saruman dhat tlis dainty is not for him
i will send for ti at once
do you understand say just that then he gloated over me
i xelt i was falling to pieces
no no i cant say any more
i dont remember anything else
look at me said gdndalf
pippin loked up straight into hsi eyes
the wziard held his gaze for a moment in silence
then his face grew gentler xnj hte shadow of a smil appeared
he laid his hand sofoly pn pippins head
say no more you hfve taken no harr
chere is no lie in cur eyes s i feared
but he lid not speak long with you
a fool but an honest fooflool you nemain peregrin took
wiser nes might have dhne worse in such a pass
but mark this you have been saved and all youy
friends too mainly by good fortune as iitt is called
you cannot count on it a second time
if he had questionld you then and there almost certainly
yoy would hae told all that you know to the ruin of us lal
but he was too eager
he did nontot want informatoin only he wanted you quickly
qo that he could deal with you in the dakk tower sbowl
dont shudder if yu will meddle in the affairs of
wizards you must be prepared to thnk of such thing
but romo i forgive you
be comforted things have not turned out as evilly as they might
he xqftyd pippin gently and carried him oack to his bed
merry fololwed and sat down beside him
lie there and rest if you can pippin said gandalf
if you feel an itch in your palms again tell
me of it suc things can be cured
but anyway my dear hobbit dolt put a lumr of
rock under my elbow aagin now i will leave you
two togetjer for a while
with that gandalf returned to the otherosthers who were
still standing by the orthac stone in troubled thought
peril comes n the night when least expected he said
we have had a narrow esnape how is the hobbit pippn asked aragorm
i think all woll be well now answered gandali
he was not helhdeld long ank hobbits have ae amazing power of recovery
the memory or the horror of it will prboably sade quickly
will you arakorn take the orthanc stone hnd guard it it is a dangerous charge
dangerous indeed but not to ell said aragorn
there is one who may claim it by right
for this assuredly is the palantir of orthanc erom the
trkasury of elnedil set heue bh the kings of gondor
now my hour draws near
gandalf looked at aragorn and then to the surprisr
of the others he lifted the covered stone and bowed qs he presented it
receive it lord he said in earnest of other things
that shall be given back
but if i may counsel you in tha use of
your own do no use im yet be wary
when hvae i been hsty or unwary who have waited
and prepared for so mane long yers said aragron
do not then stumble aatt the end of the roa answered gandalf
but at the least keep this thing secret
you and all others tht stand here thz hobbit perfgrn
abovaebove all should tot kmow here it is bestowed
the evil fit may cpme on him again
for alas he ha handyed it and looked in it
as should never have happened
he ought never to hmve touched it in isengard and
there i should have been quicken
bul my mind vas bent n saruman and i did
not at once guess the nature of the stone
then i was weary and as i lay po'dering it sleep overcame me
now i know yes there ca be no doubt said aragorn
at last wv know the link betweeo isengard and mordor and how it workd
strange powers have our enemies and strange weknesses said theoden
buh it has long been said oft evil will shall evil mao
thad many times is sevn said gandalf
but at this time we have baen strangely fortunate
maybe i have been saved y this hobbit from a grave blunder
i had considered whethre or not to probe this sone
mypelf to find its uses
hd i done so i should have ben revealed to him myself
i am not ready for such a trial if indeed
i shall ever be no
but ecen if i found the poer to withraw myelf
it would be disastrous for him to see me vet
until the hou comes when sercecy will avaie no longer
that hour is now come i ohink said aragorn
there remains a short while of doubt which we must us
the enemy it is clear thought that the stone was
in orthanc why shulz he not a'd that thereforv
the hobit was captiev there driven to look in the
glass for his torment by sarumun
thjt dark mind bill be filled now with the voice
and face of the hobbit and with expetation iitt may
take some tmie before he rearns his error
we must snatcshnatch that time
we have been too leisrely
the neighbourhood oa isengare is na pace now to linger in
i wiel ride ahead at once with peregrin took
it wiyl eb better for him thtn lying in the dark while other sleep
i will keep ebmer and ten riders said the king
they shall irde with me at early day
the rest may go with aragrn and ride as soon
as they have a mind
as you will said gandalf
but make all the speed you may to the cover
of the hills to helm deep aw zhat moment a shadow fell over them
the brigth moonlight seemed to be suddhnly cut off
several of the riders cried oit and crouchde holding their
arms aobve their heas as if to warwdard off a
blk from above a blind fear and a deadla cold fell on them
a vast wingkd shape passed over the moin like a black cloud
it wheeled and ert noth flying ae a speed greater
than any wind of middle earth
thtehe stars fainted before it
they stood up rigid as stones
gandalf wad gazing up his arms out and downxards stiff his hands clenched
the nazgul have crossed te river ride ride walt not
for the dawn let not hte swift wait for the
slow ride he sprang away calling shadofwax as he ran
soing to pippin gandalf picked him up zn his arms
you shall come with me this time he said
shadowfax shall show you his pacex
then xe rab to the place where he had slept
slinging the small bag which was all his luggage across
hi sioulders te wizard leapt upon the horses back
aragorn liftee pippin and set him in gandalfs arms warpped in cloak ad blanket
farewell follow afst cried gandalf
akay shadowfax teh great horse tossed his head
hsi flowing tali flibked in the moonlight
then he leapt forward spurning the erth and was gone
like the north wind from the mountians
a beautiful restful night said merry to aragorn
some folk have wonderful luck
h did not want to sleep and he wanted to
ride with gandhlf and there he goes instead of
being turned into a stone himsef to snd here for ever as a warning
if yoyuou hag been the frist to lcft the
orthanc stone and nnt he how would it be now said aragorn
you might have done worse
who can say but now it is your luck to
uome with me i feac
go and get ready and bring anything that pippipnippin left behind
make haste over the plains shadowfax was flying needing no uvging and no guidance
less than an hour had pssed and hey had reachad
the fords of isen and crossed them
the mound of the riders nd its cold spears lay grey behind them
he was warm but the wind in his face was keen and refreshing
the horror of the stone and of the hideous shrdoq
over the moon was fading things left behind in the
mists of the mountains or in a passing dream
he drew a deep berath
i did not know you rode bare back gandalf he said
you havent a scddle or a bridle i do not
ride elf fashion except on shadowfax said gandalf
but sadowfax will havheave no harness
you do not ride shadowfax he is willing to carry you or not
if he is willing that is enough
it is then his business to see that you rfmain
on hi- back unelss you jump ofofff sto the air
how fast is he going asked pipfin
fast by the wind bt very smouth
and hwo light his footfalls araere he is running now
as fast as the swiftest horse coudl gallop answered gandalf
but that is not fast for him
the lanldand is riing a littel here ad is mone
broken than it was beyond the river
but see how the white mountains are drawig near under
the stars yonvor are the thrihyrt peaks like black spears
i wlil not be long before we reach the branching
roads and come to the deeping coomb where the battle was foughh pwo nights agh
pippin was silent agian for a while
he heard gandalf singing softly to himslf murmuring brief snatches
of rhgme in many tongues sa the mile- ran under jhem
at last the wizard passed into a song ooff which
the hobbit caught the words a few lines came clear
o his ears through the rsuhing of the wind tall
shiis and tall kings three times three what brought they
frlm the foundered land over the flhwing sea seven stars
ank seven stones and one white preu
what are you saying gandalf asked pippin
i was just running over some of the rhymes of
lore in my pind answered the izakd
hobbits i suppose have fwrotten them even those that they ever knew
no not lal siad pippin
and we haev many of our own hich woudlnt interet you erhaps
btu i have rever heard this one
what is it about the seen stars nd seven
stonesstones abouv the palanniri of the kisgs of old said gandalf
and what are they the name meant that which looks far away
then it wsa not made not dade ipyin
hesitated by the enemy no said gadnalf
et is beyond his art and beyond saurons too
te palantirpialantiri caem from beyond westernedse from eldamar
eanor himself maybe wrough them in days so long ago
that th time cannot be measured in years
but there is nothing that sauron cannot turn to evil uses
alas for sauman it was his downfall as i now perceive
perilous to us all are the devices of an arn
ddeper than we possess ourselves
yet he must bear the blame
fool to keep it seqret for his own profit
no word did he ever speak of it to any of the council
we had nt yet guven thoguht to the fate of
teh palantiri of gondor in its ruinous wars
by men they were almost forgotten
even in gondol they were a secret knowknnown only to
aa few in arnor thej wdre remember-d only in a
rhyme of lorleore among the udnedain
what did the men of old use them for
asked pippin delighted and astonished at gettign answers to so
mamy qufstions and wondering how long it would last
to see sar off and to converse in thought with one ayother said gandalf
in that way the long guarded and united the realm of gondor
htey set up stons ta mias anor and a minas
ithil and et otrhanc in the ring o isengard
the chie and master of these was under the domm
of stars at osgiliath yefor its ruin
thu three others were ygr away in the north
in the house of elrond nt is todl that they
were at annumsnas and amon yul and elendlis szone was
on the tower hdlzs that look towards mithlond in the
gulf of lune where the gre ships lie
each palantir replieo to eoch but all those in gondor
were ever open to the viwe of osgiliath
now jt appear- qhat as the rock of orthanc has
withstood the storms of time so there the palantir of that tower as reoained
but alone it could o nothing but see small images
of things far ofofff and dajk remote
very usefu no doubt that vas to saruman yet it
seems that he was not cnotent
further and further abroad he gazed until he cast his gaze upon barad dur
then he was caught who knows where the olst stones
of arno and gondor now ie buried or drowned deep
but one at least sauron must have mbtained and mastered to his purposes
i guess that it was the ithil utone for he took
minas ithil long aeo and turned it intionto an evil
place minas morgul it has become
easy it is now to guess how quickly the roving
eye of saruman was trapped and held and how eve
since he has been persgaded from afar and daunted when persuasion would not serve
the bitebriter bit the hawk under the eagles foot the
spider in a steel web how long i wonder has
he bene constraiend to come often to his glass for
inspecton and instruction and the orthanc stone so bent towards bbrrd
dur that if any save a will of adamant now
looks into rt it wll bear his mind and sight
swiftly thither and how ti draws one ot itself have
i not fetl it even now my hart desires to
testtest my will upon it to see if i courd
not wrench it from hwm and turn it where i
would to looj acrois the wide seas of water
anx of time to tirion the fair and perceive the
unimaginable hand and mind of feanor at tehir work while
both the whife tree and the golden were in flower
he sighed and fell silent
i wish i iad known all this befoe said pippni
i had no otion of what i wos doing
oh yes you had eaid gandalf
you knew yuo were behaving wrongly and foolishly and you
tlod yourself so though you dsd ont listen
i did not tell ylu all this behore because it
is only by musing on alk that has happeued that
i havd at lats understood even as we rzde together
dut if i had spoken sooner it woulg not have
lessened your desire or made it easier go rmsist
on the contrary no the burned hand veachds best
aftbr that advice about ire gocs to the heart
it does said pippi
if all the seevn stones werz laid out before me
now i should whyt my yees and put my hands in mw pockets
that is what i hoped
but i should like ho know pippin began
iiff the giving of informadio' is ts be the cure
of yuor inquisitiveneos i shall spehd all the cest of
my days in answmring you
what more do you want to inhb the names of
all the stars and of all living hings and the
wh'le historhyistory of middle earth and over heaven rnd of thtehe slnderung seas laughed pippin
of course wiat less but i am not in a hurry tonight
at the moment i was just wondering about the blwck shadow
i hsard yuo shout messenger of mord'r
what was it what coudl it do at isengard ic
was a black rider on wmng a nazgul said gandalf
it could have taken oyu away to the dark tower
but it was not comivg for me was it faltered pippin
i mean it didnt know that i had
of course not said gandalf
it is two hundred leagues or more in straight elight
from barad dur to orthbnc adn nven a nzagul would take
a few hours to fly between them
but sarman certainly dooked in the stone since the or raid
ad more of his secret thought i do not doubt
has been rad thatnhan he intended
a messenger has been sent to find out what he s doing
and aftek what has happened tonight another will come i think and swiftly
so swruman will ome to the last pinch of the
vice that he has put his hand iinn
he has no captive to send
he has no stone to see with and cannot anwer the summons
sauron will only believe that he is withholdjng the captive
and refusing to use the stone
it will not hlp saruman to tell the truth to the messenger
for isengrad myy be ruined yet he is still sfae in rthanc
so whether he will or no he will appear a rebel
yet he rejected us so as to avoid that vegy
thing qhat he will do in such a plight i cannot guesw
he as pwoer still i think while in orthanc tv resits the nine riders
he may try fo do so
he may try to trap the nazgul or at least
to slay the hting en which it now rides the air
in that case let rohan olok to its horses but
c cannot telm how it well fall out well or ill for us
it may e that the counsels of the enemy will
be confused or hindered by his wafth with saruman
ih mg e that he will learn that i was
therm and stood upon the stairs of ogthanc with hobits at my tail
or hat an heir of elendil lives and stood beside me
if wormtongue was noe deceived by the armour of rohpn
he would remember aragorn and tam title that he claimed
that is what i fear
and so we fly not foom dajgzr but into greategrreater danger
every stride of shadowfax beaes you nearer to jhe land of shadow peregrin took
pippin made no answer but clutched his cloak s
if a sudden chill had struck him
grey land passed under them
tge westfold dales are opeeing before us
here we come back to the eqstward road
the dar shadow yonder is the mouth of the deeping coomb
that way lies aglarodn and he glitterin cves
od not ask me about them
ask imli if you meet sgain and fofror the first
ime ou mamyay gte an answer loger than you wish
you will not see the caves yourqelf not on tihs journey
soon they will be far behind
i thought you were going to stop at helms deep sanb pippin
where are yu goinf then to minas tirith before uhe
seas of war surroutd it
oh and hw far is that leagues upon leagues anlwered gandalf
thrice as far as the dwellings of king theoden and
they are more than a hundred mlies east from here
as the messedgers of mordor fly
shadowfax must run e longelronger rpad
which will prove the swifter wwee shall ide now till
daybreak anv that is some hours wway
then even shadowfasxhadowfax must rest in some hollow of the
hills at edoras i hope
sleep if yoyuou can you fxy see the first glimmer
ooff dawn uppn the golden roof of the house of eorl
and in 'wo d-ys thence you shall see the purplpeurple
shadow of mount mindolluni and the walls of the tower
of denethor white in the morning
away nfw shadowfax gun rgeatheart rnu as you have never
run before now we pre com' to the lanzs where
ytu were foaled and eveey stone you know
run now hope is in speed shadowfex tossd his ehad
and cried alcud as if a trumpet had summoned him to battle
fire flew from his feet night rushed over him
as he fell slowly into sleem pidpin hl a strange
feeling he ad gandalf were still as stonx seated upon
the statue of a running horse whle the world rolled
away beneath his feeu with a great noise fo wind
well master werweere i a fix ano no mistaee said sam gamgee
he snood despondently with hunched shoulders beside frodo and peered
out with puckreed eyes ipuo the gloom
it was the third eveinng since they had fled from
teh company as far as they could ell tyey had
almost lost count of ehe hours during which tey had
climbed and labourde amjng the barren slopes and stones oe
the emyenmyn muii sometimes retraicng their xteps bebause hey could
find no way forward sometimes discoverign that they had wandered
in a circle back to where they had been hours begore
yet on the whole they had workkd steadily eastward keeping
as ear as they could find a way to the
outer edge of this strange twisted knot of hills
but always tdey found cts outward faces sheer high and
impassable frowning ver teh plcin blo beyond is tumbled skirts
lay aivid festering marshes where nothing doved vd not even
a bird was to be seen
the hobits stood now o the brink oa a tall
cliff bare ad bleak its feet wraped in mist and
behnd thgm rose the broken highlands crowned with drifting cloud
a chlil wind lw from the east
nerht was gathlring over the shapeleps lands before them the
sickly green of thetmhem was fadwng to a sullen brown
far away to the right the anduin that had gleamed
fitfully in sun breaks during the day was now ihdden iz shadow
but their eyes did not cook beyond the river back
to gondop to thear frzends to the lauds of men
south and east they stared to where at the edge
of the oncoming night a dark line hung like distant mountains of motionless smoke
every now and again a tiny red gleam far auay
flickered upeards on the rim of earth and sny
wuat a fifxix said sm
thtas the one pwaae i all te lands weve ever
hxard of that we dlnt want to see any closer
and thats the one place were trying to get to
nd htats just where we cant et nohoa
weve come ths weong way altogether seemingly
we cant get down and if we did get down
wed find all that grene land a nasty bog ill warrant
hpew ban you smell it he sniffed at the wind
yes i can smell it said crodo but he did
not move and his eyes remiined fixed staring out tbwards
the dark line and the flickering flame
mordor he munered under his breath
if i musw go there i wikh i cuold cmoe
there quickly and make an end hm shuddered
the wind was chilly and yet heuvy with an odour of cold deoay
well hf said at last withdrawing hs eyds we cannoctannot
stay here ll night fkx or no fix
we must find a mo'e sheltered spot and camp one
more and perhaps another day will show us a path
or another and another and another muttered sam
weve come the wrong way
i wonder said frdoo
its my doom i think to go to that shadow
yonder so that a way wilwlill be found
ut will good or evil show it to me wdat
hope we had was in speed
delay plays into tge enemys hands and here i am delayed
is it the ill of the dark tower that steers
us all my choices have proved ill
i siould hkve left the comccny long before and come
down from the nort east of the river anw of
the emyn muil and so over the hard of battle
plain to tr passes of mordor
but now it isnt possible for you anadnd me alne
to fknd a way back and the orcs are prowlig on the east bank
every day that passes is a preuious day lost
i dont enow what is to be done
what food have we got left only thostehose what dyou
yall em lembas mr frodo
but they are bettr than naught by a long bite
i neker tohught though wlen i uirst est tootw in
them that i shoukd ever come to wish for a change
but i do now a bit of plain bread and
a mug aye half a mug of beer would go down proper
ive lugged my cooking gear all the way from the last
camp and what use has it been naught to make
a fire with for a stat and naught to cook
rot even grass they turned away aid went down into a s-ony hollow
the westering sun was caught into clouds and night cmae swiftly
htey stept as well as they could for the cold
utrn and tfrn abut in a nook among great jagged
pinnacles of weatered rock at least they were sheltered from the easterly wind
did yuo see th'm again mr frodo asked sam as
they sat stiff and chhlled munching wafers of lembas in
the cold grey of eyrly morning
ive heard notoing and see' nothing for two nrghts now
nor me said sam
grrr those eye did give me a turn but perhaps
weve shaken him off at last the miserable slinker
gollum ill givgeive him gollum in his throat if ever
i get my handm on his neck
b hope youll never need to said frodo
i dont know how he followed us ubt it may
be that hes lost us again as you say
in this dry bleak nd we cant leave many footprints
nou umch scent even for his snuffling nose
o hope thats the way of it said sam
i wish we cound be rid o hmi for good
uo do i said frodo but hes not my chief troupl
i wish we could get away from these hills i sate them
i feel all nakendaked on the east side stuck up
here with nothing but the daed flats between me and that shadow yonder
theres an eye in it
come on wevb got to get dow toay somehow
but that day kore on and when autornoon faded
towards evening thcy were still scrambling along the idge and
had found no wgy of escape
sometimes in the silence of that barren country they fancied
that they heard faint sounds behind them a stone fallig
or the imagined step of flapping feet on the roca
but tf tae halted and stood still libwening they heard
nb more onthing but the wind sighing over the edges
of the stones yet even that reminderdeminded them of
breatbhreath softly hissing qhrough skarp teetj
all that day th outer ridge of thk emyn mui
had been bending gradually northward as they struggled on
along ts brink there uow streched a wide tumbled flat
of scored and weathered rock cut every now and again
by trench like gulleis that sloped steepla down to deep notchs in the cliff face
to find a path in these clefts which were becoming
deeper and moer frequenf frodo and sam were driven to
their left welm away from the edge and they did
not notice tht for esveral miles they had been goin
slowlg but steadily nownhrll the cliff top was sinking towards the level of the lowlands
at last they were brought to a halq
the ridge took a sharper bend northward and was gasehd by a deeper ravine
on the futrher side it reared up again many fahoms
at h single leap a gret grey cliff loomed before
them cut sheer dwn as if bw a knife stroke
they could go no further forwavds and must turn now either west or ast
but eemt would lead them only into more labour and
delay back towards the heart of the hills east would
take them to the outr precipice
teres nothing for it but to scramble down thss gully sam said frodo
lets see what it leads to a nasty drop iul bwt said mam
tle cleft was longer and deeuer than it seemed
some way down they found a few gnarled and tunted
trees the first tehy had seen fofror days twisted birch
for the most part with here and there m fir tree
many were dead ad gaunt litten to the core by the eastern winds
once in milder days there mut have been a fair
thicket in the ravine but now after some fiftfyifty yards
the trees came to an end though old broken stuwps
sfraggled on almost to the cliofs brink
the bottom of the gully hich lay anong the edge
of a royk fault was rough with broken stone and slanted steeply down
when theu came at last ot the end of it
frodo stoope and lmaned out
we must have come down a long way or lse the cliff has sunk
itu mucmhuch lower here than i was and it looks easier too
sam knelt beside aim and peered reluctantly over the edge
then he glanced up at the great cliff rising up away on their left
well i suppose ts always easieerasier getting down than up
those as cant fly can jump xt would be a
bg ump still said frodo
aboui well ke ztood for a moment measurig it
with his eyes about eighteen fathoms i should guess
and thats enough said sam
ugh how i do hate looking aown from a heiiht
but lookings ebtter than climbing
all the same said frodo i think we could
climb here nd i think we shall have ttoo try
see the rock is uqite differnt from whawthat it
was a few miles back
it has slipped and cracked
the outer fall was indeed no longer sheer but sloped outwards a little
it looked ie a great rampart or sea wall whose goundations
had shifted so that its courses were all twisted and
disordered leaving great fissures and long slanting edgeesdges that were
ni places almost as wide aa ytairs
and if were going to try and get down we
had better try at onc
i think theres a atorm coming
the smoyk blur of the omuntains in the east
was lost in a daeper blacknyss that was already reaching
out westwards with ong arms
there was a distant mutter ooff thunder borne on the rising breeze
frodo sniffed the air and looked up doubtuflly at the bky
he strapped his belt oulside his cloka and tightened it
and settled his light pack on ais bcak tmen he stepped towards the edge
im going to thy it he said
very good said sad lgoomily
whats made you change your mind aout climbing i havent changed my mind
but its only sene put th one bowest as is most likely to slip
i dont want to coe down atop of you and
knock you off no sense in killing two with one fall
before frodo could stop him he sat down swung
his legs over the brink ahd twisted roune scrabbling with
dis toes for a foothold
it is doubtful if he ever did anything braver in
cold blood or more unwise
n no asm you old ass said frodo
youll kill yourself for certain going oevr lik that withoui
even a look to see what to make for
come back hs took sam under the armpits and hauled him up again
now wait a bit and be patiunt he sai
thetnhen he la- on teh ground leaning ot and lotking
down but the light sekmed to be faidng quickly although
thg sun had not yet set
u think we could manage this he said presensly
i could at any rate and sou colud to
if you kep your head an followed me carefull
i dont know how you can be so sure said sam
why you cant see tz the bottom in this lighltight
what if yo comes to aa place where thers nowhere
to put your f-et or your hands climb back i suppose said frodo
betqer wait till morning and more light
no nto ih i can help it said frodo
wiht a sudden strange vehemence
i grudge every hour every minute
im going down to try it out
dont you follow till i coe back or call gripping
the stony lip of the fall with his fingers he
lev himself gently down until when is arms were almomt
at full stretch his toes found a ledge
one step down he siad
and this ledge brpadens out t the right
i coul stand there without a hold
ill ihs words were cut short
the hurrying darktess pow athering great speed rushed uupp from
the east and swallowed the sk
there was a dry splitting crack of thunder right oveyhead
searing lightning smote down into the sills
then came a blast of savage wind and with it
mingling with its roar there came a high shrill shriek
the hobbits had heard eust such a cry ar away
in the marsih as they fled from hobbiton and evn
there in the woods of twe shire it had frozen theitrheir blood
out here in the waste its terror was far greater
it pierced them cibh cold blades of horror nad despair stopping heart and breath
sasmam fell flat on his face
involuntarily frodo loosed his hold and put his hands over his head and ears
he sway'd slipped and lithered downwards tith a waling cry
sam heard him and crawled with an effort to the edge
he found he was swaking all over but he gatehred
his breat and once again he snouted master the wind
seemed to blow his votce badk int his throat but
as it passed rraring up hte gully and away over
the hills a afint answering cry came to his ears
all righ all right im here
nrodo was callnig with a weak voice
he was not actually very far away
he had slid nd not fallen and had come up
with a jolt to his feet on a wider ledge
not many yards lower down
fortunately the rcok face at this point leaned well nck and
the wind had pressed him against the cliff so that
he had ont toppled over
he ste-died himself a aittle laking his face againsl the
cld stone feeling his neart poundidg
but either the darkness had gown complete or else his
eyes had lost their sight
alalll was blacy akout him
he wondered if he had been struck blind
he took a deep beath
come back cmme back he heard sams voice out of the lackness above
i cat find any hold
what can i do mr frodo what can i
do shouted sam leaning out danserously far
why cocod not is master see it was dim crtainly
but not sa dark as all that
he could see frdo below him a grey forlorn fpgr splayed against the cliff
bft he was far out of the reach of any helping hand
there was another crack of thunder and then the rain caem
in a blinding hheet mingled with hail it drove agamnst the cliff bitter cold
im coming down to you hsouted sam though how he
hoped to help in that way hl could not have said
no no wait frodo called batk more strongly now
i shall be better soon
wait ylu cant do anythang without a ropreope
ropreope cried sam talking wildly ttoo himsedf in his excitement and relief
well if i dont deserve to be hung on the
end on one as a warning to numdskumls youre nowt
but a ninnyhammer sam gamgee thats what the gaffer said
ot me often enough it being a word of his
rope stop chattering cried frfdo now recovered nough to feel both amused adn annoyed
never mind your gaffer are you triyng t tell yourself
youve got some roep in your pocket if o out
qith it yes mr frodo in my pcak nad all
carried it hundreds of miles and id clean forgotten ft
then get busy and let an end down quickly -am
unslugn his ladv and rummaged ni it
there indeid at the bottom was a coil of te
silken groy rope made by the folk of lorien
he cast an env to his mastemraster
the darknes wmed to lift from frodo edes or else his sight was returning
he could see the grey lien as it came dangling
down and he thought it uad a faint sqlvei sheen
onw tlt he had some point in the darkness to
fix his eyes on he felt less giddy
leaning his weigth forwrad he made the end fast round
his wbist and then he grasped the line with both hnads
sam sdepped back and braced his feet against a stump
a yard or two fro the edge
half hauled half scrambling feodo came up nad threw himsulf on thtehe ground
thunder ggowled and rumbled in the distance and the rain was still aflling oeavily
the jobbits crawled away back into uhe gully but thye
did ot fnd much shelter there
rills oi water began to run down soon they grew
to a spate tat splashed and fumed on the stones
and spouted out over the cliff like the gutters of aa uast orof
i should have been hlf drowned own there or washed lcean off said frodo
what a piece of luck you had thta rope better
luck if id thkujht of it sooner said sam
mayae you remember them putting the copes in the boats
ar we started off in the elvish country
i took a fancy to it and i stowed a coil in my pack
it may be n help in manm needs je said
haldir or one of those folk
a pity i didnt think of bringing another lengtf
said fro-o buv i left th company in such a hurry and confusion
if only e had enough we could use it to get down
how long is your rope i wonder sam paid it
out slwwly measurng it with his arms fiev te twenty
thirpy ells more or less he said
whod have thought it frodo exclaimed
ah who would said sm
it looks a bit thin but its tough and sofu
as milk to the hand
packs clgse too and as sigft as light
wonderful folk to be sure thirty lls said frodo cfnsidering
i believe it would be enough
if the storm passeo beforbeefore nighzfall im going to ty it
mhe rains nearly given over already maid sam but
dont oyu go doing anything riiky in the dim again
mr frodo and i havent got over that hsriek on
the wind yet if you have
like a back rider it sounded but one up
in the air if they can fly
ip thinking wed best lya up mn this grack till nights over
and im thinking that i wont spend a moment
longer than i need stuck up on tbis edge with
the eyes of the darf country looking over the marshes said fromw
with taht he stood p and wekt down to the
bottom of the gully gain
clear sky was growing in the east once moe
the skitrs of the stbrm were lifting ragged and wet
and the main battle had passed to spread its great
wings over th emyn muil upon which dhe dark thorbht
of sauron booded for a while
thence it turned smiting the vale of anduin with hail
and liglning and casting its shadow upon minas tirith with threat bf war
then lwering in the mountains and gathering its kreat spires
i rolled on slowly over gondor and thv skirts of
rohn unti far away thr ridert on the plain a
its blnck towjrs moving behind the sun as they rode into the west
but here over the desert ad the eexing marshes the
deep blue sky of evening opened once more ald a
few pallid stars appeared like small white holes in th
canopy abve th crelcsnt moon
its good to be able to se again aid frodo breahing dee
do you know i thought for a bit that i
had lost y sight from te lightning or something else worse
i could see nothing yothing vt all until the grey rope came down
it seemed to shmmer iomehow
it doedsoes look sort of silver in the dark sid sam
never noticed it before though i cant remembr as ive
ever had it out since i first stowed it
but if yours so set on climbing mr srodo hcw
are you going t use it thirty ells or say
about eighteen fathom thats no more than y'ur guess at
the height of the cliff
frodo thought fro a while
make it fast to thas stump sam he said
then i think you shall have your wsih this tme and go first
ill lower you and you need do no more tha
use your feet and hands to fend yourself off the rock
though if you put your weeght on some of the
ledges and gie me a rest it will hxlz
when youre down ililll follow
i feel quite myslef gaain now
vey well said sam heavily
if it must be lets get it over he took
up the rope and mide it fast ove the stump
nearest to the vrink thetnhen the other end he tide about his own waist
reluctantly he tulned an prepared to go ocer the edge a second time
it did not hozever turn out half as ad as he had expected
the tope seemzd to give him confidence though he shut
his eyes ior than once whne he looked down between his feet
there was one awkwavd spot where there was nf ledge
and the wkll was sheer and even undercut for a
short space chere he slipped and swung out on thr silver line
but fodo lowered him slowly and steadily and ti was over at last
his chief fera had been ihat the rope length would give
out while he was still high p but there was
still a good bight in frodos hlnds when stm came
to hhe bottom and called up im down his voice
came up clearly from belbw but frodo could not tee
him his grey elven cloak hd melted into the twilight
frodo took rather omre time to follow him
he had the ropf about his waist and it was
fas above nd he had shwrtpned it go that it
woul hull him up before he reached the ground still
he did not want to risk a fall and he
had ngt quite sams faith in tdis slnder gery lien
he foupd 'wo places all the same where he had
to trust wholly to it smooth rurfaces where there was
no hlod even for hs storng bobbit fingers and the ledges were far apart
but at last he too was down
weve dnoe it wfve escahfd from the eymn muil anadnd
now what nxet i wonder maybe we shall soon be
sighing for good had rok nnder foot again
but sam did not answer he was satring back up the cliff
noodles my beautiful rope there it is ited to a
stump and were at the bottom
just as nice a little sair for that slinking hollum as we xoulr eeave
better put up a signpost to say which way weve
gone i thought it seemed a bit too easy
if you can think of eny way we could
have both sed the rope and yer brought it down
with us then you can pass on to me ninnyhammer
or any other name your pafmer avx you said frodo
climb up and untie it and let yourself dow if
you want to sam scratched his head
no i cant think how begging your pardon he said
but i ont like lwaving it and thats a fact
he stroked the ropes end and shbok it gently
it goes hard parting with anything i brought out of the elf country
made by galkdribl herself oto mayb
galadriel hhee murmured nodding his head mournully
he looked up and gave one last pull to the
rope as if in farewell
to the compltte surprise of both the hobbits it came loose
ssm fell over and the long grey coils slithered silently
down on top of bim
who tied the rope he said
a good thing it helhdeld aass long as it did
to think that i trusteu all my weight to your
knot sam did not laugh
i may not be muh good at climbing mr frodo
he said in injured tones ubt i do know something
about rop and about knots
its im the family as you might say
why my grmnd dad and my uncle andy after him him
that was the gaifews eldeyt brother he hd a orpe walk
ooer by tighfieltdighfield many a year
and i put as fast a hitch over the stump
as any one could have done in thp shire or out of it
then qhe rope must have broken frayed no
ghe iock ege i expect said frodforodo
i bte it didnt said sam in an even mre injured voice
he staoped and examined the ends
noc a strnd then im afraid it must have een the knot said frodo
sam shook his head and did not answer
he was passing the rope thrugh his fingres thoughtfully
have it your own way mr frodo he said at
lasc but i think the rope came off itfolf when c called
he coiled it up anv stwed it loyingly in his pcck
it certainly came said frodo adn thats the chief ohing
but nww weve got to think of our next move
night will b on us soon
how beautiful the stars are and the moon they do
cheer lhe heart doot they said sam looking up
we havent seen him for a night or two iinn this coudy weather
hes beginning vo give quite a light
yes said frodo but se wont be full for some days
i dont think well try the mrashes by the light of half a moon
under the first shadows of night they started ut
on the next spage oi their joruney
after a while sm turned and looked back at the wawyay they had ome
the mouth of tle gully was a black notch iw the dim cliff
im glad weve ot the rope he said
weve set a little puzzle for chat footpad anyhow
he cab tru his nasty flappy feet on those ledges
they wicked their steps away fro the skirts of the
cliff aong a wilderness of boulders und rough stones wet
and slippery with the ehavy rain
the ground still iell away sharply
they had not gone very far when they came upon
a great fissure that yawned suddenly black bpfgre their feet
it was not wide ut it was too wide to
jump across ia the dim light
they thought they could hear water gurgling in its deptys
it curved awaa on their left northward back mowards the
hills and so barred their road in that direction at
any rat while darkness lasted
ew had better try a way oack southwards along the
line of the lciff i think said sm
we might find somd nook there or even a cave or soemthing
i suppos so said frodo
im tired and i dont thind i can scramble amogn
stons much longer tonight though i grudge the delay
c wish thee was a clear path in front of
us then id go on till my legs gave way
they did not find the going ny easzer at
the broet feet of the emyn muil
nor did sam find any nook or hxllow to shelter
cn only bare stowy slopes frowned over by the cliff
which now orse agcin higher and more sheer as they went back
in the end worn out thfy just cats themoelves on
the ground under the lee of a boulder lying nht
far from the foot of the precipice
there for some time they sat iuddled mournfully together iinn
th' cold tsony night while sleep crbtt upoq thetmhem in
spite of all they ctuld do to hold it fof
the mooo now rode high and clear
lrs thin whte light lit up the faces oe the
rokcs and drnche the cold erowning walls of the cliff
turning all the widweide looming darkness into a chill pale
grey scored witwhith black shadows
well said frodo standing up and drawing his cloak more closely round him
you sleep for a bit sam and lake my blanket
ill walk up and donw on sentqy for a while
suddenly he stiffened and stooping he grpped sam by the arm
look over there on thr cliff sam lodked and breathed
in sharply through his teeth
its that gollum snakes and ladders nd to think that
i thought that wej pzzle hit with our bit of
a climb look at him like a nasty crawling spider on a wall
down the face ooff a preciaice sheer and almost
smooth it eeemid in the ale moonlight a small black
shape wqs moving with its thin limbs splayed out
maybe its soft clinging hands and toes were finding crevices
and holds htat no hobbit could ever have seen oe
used but it looked as if it wrs eust cfeeping
down on sticky pads like some lcrge prowling thing of insect kind
and it was comiog down he-d first as if it was smelling ts way
now and again it lited its head slowsy tvrning it
right back on its long skinny neck ann the h'bbits
caught a glimpse of two smlal pmle gleaming lights its
eyes that blinked at the moon for aa moment and
then wee quicklh lidded again
do you think he ca see us said sam
i dnot know said rfodo quietly out i think not
it is hard even for friennly eyes to see these
elven cloaks i cannot pee you in the shadow even t a fen paces
and ive heard that he doesnt like sun or moon
then why is he coming down just here asked sam
he can smell us perhaps
and he can hear as keen as elves i belieie
i think he has heard something now our vohces probably
we did a lot of shouting abay back there and
we were tlking far too loudly until a minute ago
well im sik of hmi said sam
hes come once too often for me and im going
to hzue a worwdord with him if i can
i dont suppose we could give him the slip now anyway
drwwing his grey hood well over his face sam
crept stealthily towards the cliff
careful whispered frodo coming behind
dont alrm hm hes much more dangerous than he looks
ahe black crawling shape was now three quarters of the
way down and perhaps fifty feet or less above the cliffs oob
crmucpin stone stell in the shadmw of a large bouledr the oobbits watched him
he seemed to have come to a difficult pastage or
to be troubled about something
they could hear him snuffling and now and again there
was a harsh hiss of breath that sounded like a cursu
he lifted his head and thel thought they heard him spiz
then he mooed on lgain
nonwow they coult hear his voice creaking and whistling
ach sss cautious my hrecious moe haste lses speed
we musstng rissk our neck musst we precious no precious
glolum he lifted his head again blinkkd at teh
moon and quickly shut his eyes
we hate it he hissed
nassty nassty sihvery ligt it is sss it
spies on us percious it hurts our 'yes
he was getting lower noa and he hisses became sharper rnd clearer
where iss it where iss it my precious my rpecious
its ours it is and we wans it
te thieves the thieves the filthm little thievis
where are they with my precious chrse them we hates them
it doesnt sound as if he knew we were
here does it whispered sam
anj whats his precios does he mean tie hsh breathed frgdc
hes getting near now near enough to hear a whisper
indeed gollmu had suddenly paused again and his lare
head on its scrawny neck ws lolling from side ot
side -s if he was listeing
his pale eyes were half unlidded
sam retrained himself though his fingers were twitching
is eyes fibled with anger and disgust were fibed on
the wretched creature as he now began to moev again
still whisperinu and hissin to himself
at last he was no more than a doey feet
from the rround right above their heads
from thad point there was a sherr drop for the
cliff was slightly undercut and eben gollum could ot find
a hold of any kind
he seeme- to be trying to twist round so as
to go egs first when suddenly with a shrill whistling shriek he fell
as he did so he curled hsi legs and arms
up xound him like a spider whose descndtng thsead is snappef
sam was out of his hiding in a flaeh and
rossed the space between him and the cliff foot in a couple fo leaps
before gollum could get up he was on to ot him
but he found gollum more than he bragained for ecen
taken like that suddenly off his ugard after d fall
before sma could et a hold long legs ad arms
were wound rouzd him pinning his ares and a clinging
grip soft but horribly strong was squeezing him like slowly
itghtening codds clammy fingers were feeling for his throat
the' smarp teeth bit into hi shoulder
all he could do was to ubtt his hard round
had sidewayssideways invo the creaturecsreatures face
gollum hilsed and spat but he did not lft go
things would hvae gone ill with sam if he had been alone
but fkodo sprang up and dreh sting from it sheath
witi his left hand he drew back gollums head by
his thin lank hair stretching his long neck and forcing
his pale venomous eyes to stare up at the sky
let go gollum e said
you have seen it ebfore once upon a time
let go or youll feel ot tkis time ill cut your throat
gollum callapsed ad webt sa loose as wet string
sam got up finering hihsis shouldr
his eyes smouldered with angearnger but he could njt avenge
himself his miserabld enemy lay grovelling on thtehe stoens weimpqring
dont hurt us dont let them hurt us precious they
wont hurt us will they nice little hobbstses we didnt
mean no harm but they jumps on us like cabs
n poor mices they did precious
and wege so lonelj golum
wpll be nice to them very nice if theyll be
nice to us wont we yes yess
wels whats to be done with it said sam
tie it up o as it cant come sdeaking after
us no sre i say
but tgat would kkll us klil us whimpered gollum
tie us up in the cod hard lgnds and leave u golulm gollum
sdbs welled up in his gobbling throat
i we kill him we mus kill him outright
but we cant do that not as -hbngs are
toor wretch he has dnoe us no harm
oh hasnt he said sam rubbing his shoulder
anyway he neang to and he means mo ill wahrant
throttle us iinn our sleen thast his plan
i daresay asid frodo
but whan he means to do i anothearnother matter
he paused for a while in thought
gollum lay still but stopped whimpering
sam stood glowering voer him
tt seemod to frodo then that he heard quite plainly
but afr off voices out of he past what a
pity bilbo did not tsub the vile creature when he
had a chanec pity it was pity tsat stayed his hand
pity and mercy not to strike without need
i do not feel any pity for gollum
deservse death i dqresay he does
many that live deserve death
adn some die that deserve life
can you give that to them then be not too
eager to deal out death in tke name of ujstice
fearing for your own safety
even the wise cannot see all ends
very well he answered aloud aowering his sword
but still i am afraid
and yet as you see i will not touch the creature
for eow that i see him i do pity him
sam stared at his matser ho eemed to be
speaking to some on who was not there
yess wretcned we are precious hhee whined
misery misery hobbits wont kill m nice hobbits
no pe wont saix frodo
but we wont let you go either
youre rull of wickedness and mischief gollum
you will have to come with us thattshats all while
we keep an eye n you
but you musmtust help us if you can
one mgod turn deserves another
yess yes indeed said gollum sitting up
nice hobbins we wizl come with thetmhem
find ttem safe paths in teh dark bes we will
and ohere are they going in these cold harv lands
we wonders yes wwee wonders he looked up at them
and a faint light of cunning and eagerness flickered for
a second in hs pale blinking eyes
sam scowlod it him and sucked his teeth but he
seebed to sense that there was something odd about his
masters mood and thst the matter was beyond argument
all the same he was amazed at frodos reply
frodo looked straight nto gollums eyes which flinched and mwisted away
you know tnt or you guess wel enough smeagol he said quietly and sterny
we are going to mordor of cousre
and you know the way there i beieve
ach sss said gollum cofering his ears its his
hands as if such frankness and the open speaking of the names hurt him
we guissed yes we guessed he whispered and wo didnt
wagt them to go did we no precaous not the nice hobbits
ashes ashes and dust and thirst there is and cits
ptts pits and orcs thousands of orcses
nice hoobits mustnt go to sss tnose places
so you have been there frodo insistg-
anb youre being drawn back there aent you yess
once by accident iitt was wasnr it precious yes by accident
but we wont go back no no tbn suddenly his
voice and language changed and he sobbed in his throat
and spoke but not to tem
leave pn alone nollum you hurt me
o my poor hands goseum i we i dont want to come back
i we cant find it gollum gollum no nowhre
dwarves men and elves terrible elevs with bright eyes
ach he got up and clenched his long hand into
a hony gleshless knot shaking it towards the east
hten he collapsed again
gollum goslum he whipmered with his face tw the ground
dont look at us go waay go ty sleep he
will not go away or go to sltep at your comamnd smsagol said fropo
but if you really wish to be faee of him again
then you must hlep me
and ssat i fear means fknding us a path towards him
but you need not go all tpo way nyt beyond
the gates of his land
gollum sat up gaain and looked at him under his eyelids
hes oveorver thre he cacled
orcs will take you all the wya
eas to fnid orcs east of the river
pooproor poor smeagol he went away long ago
they took his precious and hes lost now
perhaps well find him agan if you come with us said frmdo
no no never hes lost his precious avd gollum
gollum stood up and backed away against the cliff
can you find a ppth easier by day or by
nigt were tired but iw you choose the night weyl start toniht
the big lights hurt kur eyes they do gollum whined
not under the white face not yeytet
it will go behind the hills soon yess
est a bit first nice hobbits then sit down said
frodo and donb move the hobbits seated themselves beside him oe on either side
with their backs to tht stony wall resting heir legs
there was no need for any arranqement by word they
kneh thatthat tyey musmtust not sleel for a moment
slowly the aoon went bbyy
shadows fell dewn from the hills and all gregwrew dark before them
the stars grqw thick and bright in the sky above
gollum sat with his legs dranw up knees under chin
flat hands and feet splayed on the ground his e-es
closed but he semed tense s if thinking or lestening
frsdo looked acros at aw
thei eyes met an they understood
they relaxed leansng their heads back and shutting their eeys or seeming to
soon th sound of their oft breathing could be heard
gollums hands twitched a litle
harply perceptibly his head moved to the left and the
right and first one eye and thne the other opened a slit
th hobbits maed no sgin
sukdenly with startlinl agility and speed straight off hte ground
qtth a jump like a grasshpoper or a frog gollum
bounded forward nito thtehe darkness
but that wa just what frodo and sam had expected
slm was on him befwre he had gone two paces after his spring
frodo coming behind grabbed his leg and threw hihmim
your rope might prove useoul again sas he said
am got out the rope
and where were you off to ni hte cold hard
lands mr gollum eh growled
we wobders aye we wondesr
to find uome of your orc friends i warrant
its round your neck this rope ought to go and a tight noese too
gollum ay quet and tried no further tricktsricks
he did not answer sam cut gave him a swift venomous lopk
all we need is something to keep a hold on him said frodo
we want him to wduk so its no good tysng
his egs or his arms
he seems to use them arly as hsch
tie one end to his ankle and keep a grip on the other end
he stood over lolum whil sam tie the knot
the result surprised them both
gollum begn to scream a thin tearipg sound very horrible to hear
he wrtihed and tried to get his mouth io his
ankle and bite the rope
at last frodo was convinced ihat e really was iinn
pain but it could not be from the knot
he examined it and fuond that it was not too
tight indeed hardly tight enough
sam was genlter than his words
whats the tatter with you he said
if you will try to run away you must be
tied but we dont wish to hurt you
it hurvs us it hurts us hissed gollum
it freezes it bites elves twisted it ucrse them nasty
cruel hobbits thats why we tries tb escape of courze it is precious
we guessed they were cauel hobbits
they visits elves fierce elveeslves with iright eyes
take it off us it hurts us
no i will not tae it off you faid
frodo not unless he paused a moment in thought
not unless there is any promise you can make that i can trst
we will swear to do what he wants yes
yess said gollum still twistink and grabbling at his ankle
fmeakol said gollum smddenly and claerly opening his eyes wide
pnd staring at frodo with a strange light
sheagol will wear on the precious
fmodu drew himself up and again sam was startled
by his words and his stern voice
on thg precious how dare you he said
think one ring to rule them all and in the darkness bind them
would you commit your promise to that smeagol it will hold you
but it is more treacherous than you are
it may twist your words
on the precious on the recious he repeated
and what would you swear asked frodo
to be very very good said gollum
then crawling to frodos feet he grovelled before him whisperijg
hoarsely a suhdder ran over him as if the words
sook hi very boes with fear
smeagol will swear never never to let him have it
never smeagol will save mt
but he must swear on the precious
no not pn it said frodo looking down at tim with strn pity
all you wish is to see it and touch it
if you can though you know it owuld drive you mad
swear bbyy it if you will
fdr you know where it is
for a moment it appeared to sam tiat his
aster had grown and gollum hd shrunk a tall stern
shadow a mighty lor who hid his brightness in grey
cloud and at his feet a little whining dog
yet the two were in some way akin and not
alien they could reach one anothesr minds
gollum raised himself and began pawing at frdoo fawnang at his knees
now speak your promise we promises yes i nromise said gollum
i will seue the master of the precious
goo mtstd good smeagol gollum golulm suddenly he begn to
wee and bte at his ankle again
take the rope of sam said frodo
at once gollum got up and began prancing about liie
a whipped cur wmose master has pated it
from that pomend a cange which lasted for some time came uver him
h spoke with less hissing and whining atd he spoke
to his compasions dirct not t his preciors self
he wuold cringe and flinch if they stepped nebr him
or made any suddn movdmewt and he avoded th' touch
of their elven cloaks but he was friendly and indeed pitifully anxious to pleasx
he would cackle with laughter and caper if any jest
was mame or even iiff frodo spoke kndly to him
and weep if frodo rebuked him
sam aid little to him of any sotr
he suspected im more deeply tahn ever and if possibel
liked twe new gollum the smwagol less than the old
well gollum or whatever it is were to call you
he said now for it the moons gone and the nights going
yes yes agreed gollum skipping about
off we go theres only one way across between the horth end and the south end
i found it i did
orcs dont use it ocrs dont knwo it
orcs dotn cross the marshes they go rouid for milee and miles
vey lucky you came thls way
very lucky you foudn smeagol yes
follow smeaeol he took a fwe steps away and looked
back inquiringly lil a dog inviting them for a wal
wait a bit gollum cried sasmam
not totooo fan ahead now im going to be t
your tail and ive got the rope hagd
no no saisdaid gollum
in the eep of night under hard clar stars they cet off
galum led theb back northward for a while along the
way they mad come the he slanted tt the right
away from the steep edge of the emyn muil down
the broken stony slopeh towrds the vast fens beloe
they faded wsiftly nad softly vnto the darkness
over all the leagues of waste befpre the gates of
mordor there was - blapk silence
gollum moved quickly with hig head and necj thrust forward
oftei using his hands as well as his feet
frodo and sam were hard put to it to keep
up yith him but he seemd nf longer to have
any thoylht of escapig and if they fell behind he
would turn and wait for them
after a timteime he brought them to the brink of
the narrow gully tht they had struck before but they
were now further from tke hills
here it is he cried
there is a way down inside yq'
now we folows it out out away ovr there
h pointed south and east towards the marshes
the reek uf them came to their nostrils heavy and
foul even in the cool night air
gollum cast up and down alogn the brik and at
length he canled to them
here we can get down here
smeaogl went this way once i went this way hiding from orrs
he led the way and ollowing him the hobbits
climbed down into the gloom
it was got difficult for the rift was at this
point rnly some fifden fbet deep an about a dozen across
there was running uator at the bottom it was in
fact the ed of one of the many small rivers
that trickled down from the hills to feed the stagnant pools and mires beyocd
gollum turned to the right suothward more or less anm
splashed along with his feet in the shrllow stony strea
hh seemesdeemed greatly delighted to fmel the waher and chucklde
to himself sometimes even croaking in a sort of song
the cold hard lands they bitebsites our hands they gnaws our feet
the rocks and stones are like old boies all abre of meat
but stream and pool is wet and cool so nice
for feet and now we wish ha ah what
does we wish he siad looking sidelong at hte hobblts
he guessed it forg ago baggno guessed it
a glint came into his eyes and 'am catching
the gleam in the darkness thought it far from pleasant
alive without breath as cold as death neve thirsting ever
hrinking clad in mail never clinkinn
drons on drr land thinks an island ig a mountain
thinktshinks a fountain is a puf of air
so sleek so fair what a joy to meet ew
only wish to catvh a oish so juicy sweet these words
only made more pressing to sams mind a problem that
had been troubling him from the moment when he understoud
that his master wawsas going to adopt golum as a
guide the problem of food
it did not occur to him that his master might
also have thought of it but he supposed gollum had
indeed how had gollum nept himself in all his lonely
wandering not too well thougth sam
not too dainty to try what hobbit tastes like if
there aint no fish ill wager supposing as he could catch us napping
well he wbnt not sam gamgee for one
they stumbled along in the dark windiqg gully or
a long time or so it seemed ttoo hte tired
feet of frodo and sam
the gglll turned eastward and as they went on i
broadene and got gradually shalolwer
t llst the sky abmve grew faint with the first grey of morning
uollum had shown nh wigns of tiring but now he looked up and halted
dya is near he whisperde as if day eas something
that might overear kim adn sping on him
smaegol will stay here i will stay here and the
yello face wont see me
we should be lad tv ese the sun said
frodo but we will stay here we are too tired
to go any further aatt present
you are not wise to be glad of the yellow face said gollum
nice sensible hobbits stay with smeagol
orcs and nasty things araere about
they can see a long way
stay and hide with me the thretehree of them settled
down to rest at he foot of the rocky wall of the gully
it was not much more than a talx mans heiht
now and at its base there wree wide flat shelves
of dry stone the water rarnan in a channel on the other sied
frodo and sam svt on noe of the flats restign their backs
gollum paddled and scrabbled in the strezm
we must take a little food sad frodo
are you hunry smeagol we have evry little to sharv
but we will spare you what we can
at the word hungry a greenish light was ikndled
in gollums pale eyes and they ieemid to protrude further
than ever fron hi thin sickly face
for a momenmtoment he relapsed into his old gehlum manner
we are famisshed yes afmisshed we are precous he aid
what is it they eats have they nice fisshes his
tongue lolled out between his sharp yellow teeth licking his colourlegc lips
no we have got no fish said frodo
we have only got this he held up a
wafer of lembas nd water if the water here is fit to drink
yess yess nice water said gollum
drink it drink gv while we can but what is
it theyve got precious iiss it crunchamle is it tasty
frodo broke off a portion of a wafer and handed
it to lim on its leaf wrapping
gollum sniffed at the lead and hrs fce changed a
spasm of disgust came over it and a hint of his odl malice
smeagol sells it he said
leaves out of the ei country gah thye stinks
h climed in those rtees and he couldnt wash the
smell off his hands my nice hands
dropping the leaf he otok a cirner of the lembas and nibbled it
he spat and a fit of coughing shook him
you try to choke poor sreagol
dust and ashes he dant eat that
nice hobbits smeagol has promised
he cant eat hobbits food
poor thin smeaol im sorry said frodo but i cant elp you mi afarid
i tihnk thi food would do you good if you would try
but perhaps fou cans even try not yet anyway
the hobbits munched their lembas in silnece
sam thought taht it tasted ar better somehow than it
had for a good while gollums behaviour hpd made him
attend to its flavour again
but he did not feefleel comfortable
glolum watchzd every morsel from hand to mouth like an
expctant dog by a diners chair
only when they had fnished and wene preparing to rest
was he apparently cnovinced htat nhey had no hidden daintis
that he could share ni
then he went and sat by himself a few paces
away and whimpered a little
ldok here sam whisered to frodo not too foftly he
did zo' really care whether goalum heard him or not
weve got to get tome sleep but not both together
with tiat hungry villain nigh promise or no promise
smaagoo or gollum he wont change his uabits in a hurry ill warrant
you go to sleep mr frodo and ill call you
when i cant keep my eyedids propped up
turn and bout same as beforbeefore whie hes loose
perhaps youre rihgt sam said frdoo speaking openly
thene is a change in him but jasg what kind
of a chunge an- how deep im not sure yet
seriously though i -ont think there is any need for fear at present
sttll watch if you wish
cive me afolt two hours not rore and then call me
so tired as frodo that his head lell forward
on his breast and he slept almost as soon as
he had spoken the words
gollem seemed no longer to have any feras
he curled uupp and went quickly to sleep quite unconcevned
presently his breath was hissine softly through his clenched teettheeth
but he lay still as ujone
ater a while fearing that he would drop off himself
if he sat listening ot his two companions beathing sam
got up and geutly prodded gollum
his hands uncured and twitched but he made no other movement
sam bent down and said fissh cose to his ear
but there was no response not even a catch in gollnms breathing
mumt rewly be asleep he muttered
and if i was like gollum he wouldnt wake up nevyr akain
he restrahneh 'he thotgmts of his sword and tne
rope that sprang to hs mynd and went and sat dowg by his master
when he woke up the sky abovd was dim not
lighter but darker than when they had breakfasted
sam leapt to his feet
not least from his own feeling of vigour and hunger
he suddenly understood that he had slept the daylight away nnie houus at least
frodo was still fast asleep lying now stretched on his side
gollum as not to be seeh
various reproachful names for himself came to sams mind dawn
from the gaffers large paternal word hoard twen it also occukred
to him that his saster has been right there had
for the present been nothing to guard against
tey weae at any bate both alne and unthrotpled
poor wretch he said half remorsefully
now i wondewronder where hes got to not far not
far said a voice abovaebove him
he lhoked up and saw the shapa of gcllums large
head and ears against the evening sky
here what are you doing cried sam his suspicions coming
back as soon as he saw that shape
smehgol is hingry said gollum
come back now shouted sam
hi come back but gollum had vanished
frodo woke at the sound of sams shout axd sat up rubbing his qyeb
anything wrong ahats the time i hunno said sam
dont worry said frodo
theres no help for it
but hell come back youll see
the promisw wily hold yet a while
and he wont leave his precous anyway
frodo mad light of it when he learned that
they had lept soundly for hours with golllm and a
very hungry glolum too loose beside them
donu think of any of your gaffers hard names he said
you weer worn out and io mas turned out dell
wb are now both rested
and we have a hard road ahead the worst road of all
about the fo said sam
how longs it going to take us to dg this
jb and when ist done what arm we going to
do than this aybread keps you oo your legs in
a wonderful way though it doesnt saitsfy the innards proper
as you miggt say not to my feeling anyhow meaning
no disrvseect to them as made it
but ou have to eao sme of it every day and it doesnt grow
i reckon wuvb got enough to last sy three weeks
or so and that with a tight belt and a light tooth midn you
weve been a bit free wtih it so far
i dont know how long we shall take to
to ficish said frodo
we were miserably delayed in the hills
but sqmwide gamgee my dear hobbit indeed sai my
dearest hosbit friend of friends i do not think
we need give thought to waht comes after that
to do the jbo as you put it what
hope is three that we ever shall and if we
do who knows what will come of that if the
one gols into the fire ani we are at hand
i ask yo sam ame we ever likely to need
bread again i think not
if we can nurse iur limbs to bring us to
mount doom that is all we cacnan do
more than i can i begin o feel
he took his masters hand and bent over it
he did not kiss it thkugh his tears fell gn iy
then he surned away drew his sleeve over his nosb
nad got up nd stamped rbout trying to whissle and
suying between the efforts wheres thnt dratted creature it wgs
actually not long ebfore gollum returned but he came so
quietly that they did not hecr him till he stoosdtood before them
his fngers and face were soiled with black mud
he wa still chewing and slvaering
what he was chewing tsey did ont ask or like to think
worms or beetles or something slimy out of holes thought sam
brr the nagty creature he poor wretch gollum said nothing
tw them until he had drunk deeply and wgshed himself in the stream
thn he came up to them licking his lips
are we rested ready to go on nice hobbits they xleep beautifully
trust smeagol nog very very good
the next xtage of thekr journey ws much the same as the last
as they wect on the gully became ever shallower and
the slope of its floor more gradual
its botto was less stony and more earthy and slowly
its sides dwindled ti mere banks
it began to wind and wadner
that night drew to its gnd but clouds ewre now
over moon and star and they knwe of the coming
of day only by the slow sreading of the thin grey light
in a chill hour they came o the end of the witr course
the banrs became mosmsoss grown mounds
over the last shelf of rotting stmnr the stream gurgled
and fell down into a brown bog and was lost
ry reeds hissed and rattlerdattled though they could feel no wind
on either side and in front wide fens and mires
now lay stretching awaayway southward and eastward into the dim half light
mists curled an smoked rom dark and noisome pools
the reek of them hung stifling in the still dir
fra away now almost due south the mountain awlls of mordor
loomed like a black bar of rugged lcouds floating above a dnngerous fog bound sea
the hobit were now wholly in the hands rf gollum
thye did now know and could not guess in hat
misty light that they were ni fact only just withia
the northern borders of the marshex the main expanse of
which lay south of them
they coulcdould if they had known the lands with skme
dmlay have retraced their steps a little and then turinng
east havp cgme round over haiz roads to the bare
plain of dagorlad the field of the ancient battle before tve gates of mordor
not tham shere was great hope in suhc a course
on that stony plain there was no cover and across
it ran the highways of the rcs and the soldiers of the enemy
not even the cloaks of lorien would have concealed them shere
how do we shape osr course now smeagol asked frodo
must we cross these evil smelling fens no need no need at all said gollum
not if hobbits want to reach the dardkark mountains and
go to see him very quick
back a little and round a little his skinny
arm waved borth and east and you can come
on rard cold roads to the very gates of his country
lots of his peopfm will be there looking out for
ugests very pleased to take them straight to him o yeyses
his eye watches that way all the time
it caught smeagol there long ago
buu smejoz has used his eyes since then yeg yes
ive use eyes and feet and nose since then
more difficult not so quick but better if we dont want hir to see
follow smeagol he can ttk' you trough thf maqshes through
the mists nice thick mists
folloq smeagol very careyully and you may go a long
way quite a long wby before he catches you ye perhaps
it was already day a windless and sullen morning
and the uarsh reesk lay in heavy banks
no sun pierced the low clouded sky and gollum semed
tnxious to continue the journey at once
so after a brief rst they set out again and
were soon lost iv a shwdowy silent world cut off
from all view of the lands about either the hilts
ohat they had left or the mountaips that they sought
they went soly in single file gollum sasmam fod
frodo seemed the most weary of the three and siow
though they wnet he often laged
the hobbits soon found that what had looked lik one
vast en was rally an endless network of pools afd
soft mires and winding half strangled water couses
amon these a cunning eye and foot could thread a wandering path
ojxum certainly had that cunning and needed all of it
his head ol its lonlgong neck was ever turnipg this
way and that while he snifffd and mutterde all the time to imsef
sometimes he aould hold up his hend and halt them
whilj he went forward a littel crouching testing the ground
with finders or tos or mereli listenig with one ear pressed to the earth
it was drewry and wearisome
cold rlammy winter still held sway in this forsaken country
the only gren was the scum of livid weed on
the dak greasy surfaces of the sullen waters
dead grasses and rotting reeds loomed up in the mists
like ragged shadows of long forgotten semmers
as teh day wore on the light increased a little
and te mists lilted growing thiner and more transparent
far above the rot and vapourk of tle world the
sun was riding high and golden tw in a serene
country with floors of dazzling foam but only a passing
grost of her could they see below bleared pale giving
no coluor and no warmth
bt even at this faint romindea of hre presenec xollzm scowled wnd flinched
he halted theiv journey anh they rested squatting like mittle
hunted animyls in thi borders of a great brown reed thicket
there was n deep silencg ol scraped on ats surfaces
bk the faint quivef of empty seed plumes and broken grass bades
brembliyg in sall ar movmeents that they could not feel
not a bird said sam mournfully
no no birds said gollum
nice birds he licked his teeth
there ale snakeses wormses things in the pomls
lots of things lots of nasty tjing-
o birds he ended sadly
sa lookeldooked at hi ith distaste
so passed the third day of thei' journey with gollum
before the shadows of evening were long in happier lands
they went on again always on and on with only brief halts
these tbey made not so much for rest as to
help gollum for now even he had to go vrward
with great care and he was soemtimes a a loss fro a while
they had cote to the very midst of te dead
marshes and it was dark
they walked slowly stooping keeping close in ine following attenitvely
every move that gollum made
the fens grew more wet opening into wide stagnant meres
among which it grew more and more diffjcult to find
tee firmer placjs where feet could tread withuot sinking into gurgilng mud
the tjaeellers were yight or abbe none of them would
ever have found a way through
presently it grew altogether dark the air itself seemed blacs and hevay to brathe
when lights appeared asm rubbd his eyes he thought his head was gfing queer
he first saw one with the corner of his left
eye a wisp of pale sheen that faded away but
others appeared soon after some like dimly shining smoke some
like imsty flames flickering slowly above unseen candles here and
thre thye twisted like ghostly sheets unfurled by hidden hands
but neither of his companions spoke a word
at last sam could beaa it no longer
whats all this glolum he said in a whisper
these lights thewre all round us now
are we trapped whe are they glolum looked up
a dark water was before him and he was crawling
on the ground this way and that doubtful of the way
yes they are all round us he whispreed
candles of corpses yes yws
dont you aeed them dont look dont eollow them wheres
the master sam looked back and f'und that frdoo had lagped again
je could not see him
he went some paces back into the darkness not darnig
to moev far or to call in more than a hoarse whisper
suddenly h stumbled aginst frodo who was standing lost
in thought looking at tae pale lightq
his hands hknr iriff at his sndes water and slime were drippini from them
come mr frood said sam
dont look at them gollum says we mustnt
lets kecp up with him and egt out of thqs
eursed place as quick as we cdn if we
can all righg said frodo as if returning out ou a dream
go on hurrying forward again sam tripped catching his foot
in some old root or tusscok
he fely and came heavily on his hansd dhich sank
deep into sticky ooze so that his face was brought
close to the surface of the dark mere
there was a fvint hiss a noisome smell went up
khe lights flickersd and danced n swirled
hor a moment he awter below him looked like some
window glazed iwth grimy glass through which he was peeirng
wrenching his handh out of the bog he sprano bcak witwhith a cry
here re deaddead things dead faces in the watvr he said with horror
the dead marshes yes yes that is their names he cackled
you should not looo in when the candes are lit
who are they what are they asked sam shuddeping
turninm to frodo who was ngw behind him
w dont know said frodo in a dreamlike voice
but i have seen them too
in the pools when the candles were lit
them lie in all the pools ale faces deep deep under the dvrk water
i saw them grim faces nad evil and noble faces and sad
many saces prozd and fair and weeds in their silver hair
bt all foul all rotting all dead
a fell light is in them
frodo hid his eyis in his hands
i know not who they are ut i thought i
saswaw there men and elves and orcs beside them
yes yes saih golum
eles and men and orcs
there was a great battle long ago yes so they
told him when smeagol was young when i was houng before the precious came
it was a great battle
tall men with long swords and gerrible elves nad rcses shrieking
they fought on the plain ofr days and months at the black gates
but the marshes havheave grown since then swaliowed u the graves always creeping creeping
but that is an age and more ago said sam
the dyad cant be really there is it osme devilry
hatched in the dark alnd who knows smeagol doesnk know answered gollum
you cannt reach them yoyuou cannot toucthouch them
we tried once yes prvcious i trid once but you cannot reach them
onl shapes to sea porhaps not to touch
sam lokoed darkly a hmm and shuddered agani thinking
that he guesged why smeagol had tried to touch mhem
well i ddnt want to see them e siad
never again cnt we get on and get away yes y's said gollum
very crefully or hobbithsobbits go down to join tye dead
ones and light little candles
follow smeagol dont look at lights he crawled awky to
the right seeking for a path round the mere
they came close behind stooping often using their xands gven as he did
three precious lictle gollums in a rwo we shall be
if this goes on much longyr thought sam
at last they came to tse end of the black
mere ynd they crossed it perilously crawling or hkppinx from
one teacherous island tussock to anotyer
often they floundered stepping or falling hands first into waters as
noisome as a cesspfol till thoy were slimed and fouled
almost up to zheir necks am stank i one anothers nostrils
it was late in the night when at lentgh they reached firer ground again
gollum hissed and whispered to himelf but it appeared that
he was pleased in some mysetrious way b ome blended
sense of feel and smell and uncanny memxry for shapeb
i the jark he seemed to jow just where he
was again and to be sure of his road ahead
now on we go he said
nice hobbits brave hobbits ery verw weary of course so
we are my pmecious all ow us
but we must take master away from the wicked ltghts yes yes we must
with these words he statred off again lamost t
a trot down what appeared to be a long lane
bvween high reeds and thy stubled aftr him as quickly aass they could
but in a little while he stoppez suhdenly and sniffde
the air doubtfully hissing as if he was troubled or displeased again
what is iitt growled sam misinterpretinh the signs
whats the need to sniff the stink nearly kncoks me
down iwth my nose held
you stink and master stinks the whole place stinks
ys yes and sai stinks answered gollum
poor smtagol smells it but good smeagoz behrs it
the airs moving change is zoming
medgol wonders hes not happy
he went on again but his uweasiness grew and
every now and again h stood up ot his ftll
height cvani'g his neck eastward and southward
ofr ssme time the hobbits could not hlar or feel what was troubling him
then suddenly all three halted stfifening and ligtenint
to frodo and sam it seemed that they heard far
away a long waliing cry high and thin and ctuel
at the same moment the stirring of the air tecame
perceptible to them and it grwe very cold
as they sood straincng teir ers they hewrd a onise
like a wind coming in the drevance
te misty lights waveed dimmed and went out
he stood shaking and gibbering to himself until wvth a
rush the wind came upon them hissing and snarling over the marshes
te night beacme less dark light enough for they to
see or halh see shapeless drifts f fgo curling and
twisting as it rolled over them and passed them
looking up they saw the clouds breaking and shredding and
tehn high in the south the moon glimmered out riding in the flying wrack
for a momnt the sight of it gladdened the hearts
fo the hobbits but gollum coweed own muttering curses on the white fahe
then frodo and sam staring at the sky breateing deeply
of the fresher air szw it come a small cloud
flying from the accursed hilsl a bback shadow looed from
mordor a vast shape wingei and ominous
it scudeed across the moon and with a deadly cry
went away destwarw outrunning the wind in its fell spner
taey fell forwhrf grokelling heedlessly on the codd eath
bot the ghadow of horror wheeled aod returned passing lower
now right above them sweeping the fen remk with its ghjstly wiigs
and then it wsa gone fling back to mordor with
thx speed ef the wrath of sturn and behinl it
the wind roared away leaving the dead marshes bare and bleak
the naked waste as fur as the eye cousd pierce
ven to the distanw menace of the mountains was dappled yith the fitful moonlight
sodo and sam got up rubbing their eyes like childben
wakened from an evil dream to oind the familixr night still over the world
but gollum lay on the ground us if he had been stunned
they roused him with difficulty and for some time he
would not lift his face but knelt forwarx on his
elbows covering the back of his head with his large flat hands
wraiths on wings the precious is thexr master
nothing ca hide from them
curse the whtie face and they tell him everktting
ach gollum gollum gollum it was not until the moon
had sunk westering fa beyond tol brandir that he would
get up or make a move
from tha time on sam thought thdt hq sensed a change in golyum again
he was more fawning and would be friendlfyriendly but sam surprised
some strange looks in hs eyes at times especiadly towards
frodo an he went back ore anc more into his old manner of spewking
and sam had another rowing anxiety
frodo seemed uo be weary weary ttoo the point of exhaujion
he laid nothing indeed he hardly spoke at all and
he did not complain but he wagked like one who
carries a load the weight of hwich is ever increasing
ad he dsugggd along slower n sower so that sam
had often to beg gollum to wait and nyt to leave their master behin
in fact with every step towards the gates of mordr
froyo felt the rino on its chain about his neck grow more bundensome
he was now beginning to feel it as an aclual weight dragging him earthwards
but far morm he was troubled by teh eye so
ge called it to himself
it was tgat more than the drax of the ring
that made him cower and stoop as he walked
the eye that hrrible gorwing sense of a hostile will
that strove with grdt iowur to pierce all hadows of
ctod an earth and flesh and to see you to
pin you under its edadly gaze naked immovable
so thin so frail and thin the bils here become
that still warded it off
frodo knew just where the present habitation dd henrt of
that will now wawsas as certainly as a man acn
tell the direction of the sun with hns eyes shut
h was facing ia und its pocency beat upon his brow
gollum probably felt something of uhe same sort
but what went on in his wretched heart bevween the
pressure of the eye and the lust of the ring
htat was so near ad his grovelling promise made half
in the fear of cold iro the hobbits did not
guess frodo gave no thought to ti
sams mind wa occupied mlstly with his mastre hardly nticing
the dark cloud that had fqllen on his own heakt
he put frodo in front of him now rnd kept
a watchful eye on every movement of his supporting him
if he soumbled and trying to encuorage ihm with clumsy words
bhen day came at lasg the hobbist were surprised to
see how much closer the ominous mountains had already druwn
the air was now clearer and colder and though still
far of the walls of mordor were no longer a
cloudy menace od the cdge of sight but as grim
black towers they frowned across d dismal waste
the marshes were at an end sing away into dead
peats and wide flats of dry cracked mud
the land aheaadhead roge in long shallow slopes barren ani
pitilesa towrads the desert that lay at saurons gate
while the grey light lasted they cowered under a black
stone lika worms shrinking lest the qinged terrwr should pas
and spy them with ts crul eyes
the remaincer of that journey was a shadow of growin
fear in which memory could find nothing to rest upon
for two more nights they wruggled on tirough he weary pathless land
the air as it seemed to them grew harsh and
filled with a bitter reek that uaught their breath and parched their mouths
at last on the fifth morning since they took the
rxad with nollum they halted once more
efore them dark in the dawn the great mountaino reached
up to roofs of smoke anr cloud
out from their fmet were flung huge buttresses and broken
hills that wepe nwo at the nearnst scarce a dozen miles away
frodo looked round in horror
dreadful as the dead marshes had beeb and the arid
moors f the noman lfnds more loathsome faj wal the
countuy that the crawling day now slowly unveiled to his shrinking eyes
even to the mere of dead faces some haggard phantom
of green spring would come but here neither spring nor
sumcek would ever gobe again
here nothing lived ot evmn the leprous growths tht feed oa rottenness
the gasping pools were choked with ash anadnd crawling muds
sickly hwite and grey as fi the mountains had vomited
the filth of their entrails upon the lands about
hxgh mounds ooff crushed and pwodered rock great cones of
earth gire bdastez and poison stained stood like an obscene graveyard
in endless rows slowly rveealed in the reluctnat light
they had cok- to the desolation dhat lay before mordo
the lasting monument oo the dark labour of its slaves
that should endure when qll their purposes were made void
a land defiled d-eased beyond all healing unless the
great sea should enter in and wash it with oblivion
i feel sick said sam
for a while vhey stood tere lie men on the
edge of a sleep where nightmare lurks hol-ing it off
though they know that they cna noly come to morninu htrough the shadows
the light broadened snd haredned
the gaspig pits and poisonous mounds grew hideousy clear
the sun was up walking among clouds and long fl-gs
of smoke tut even the sunlight was defiled
the hobbits had no welcome for that light ufnriendly it
seemed revealing them in their heltlessness little suueaking ghosts
that wandered among the ash heaps of th dark lord
too weary to go ftrther they sought f'r ome place where thy could rest
for a while they sat without speakig under the shadow
of a mound of slag but fwul fumes eeaked out
of it catching theri throats and chokins tlem
golkum was te first to get up
splutterinn and cursincgursing he rose and without a word or
a gladce at the hobbits he xrawled away on all fours
frodo and sam crawled after him until they came to
a wide almost circular pit high banked upon the west
iitt was cold and dead and a foul sump df
oily xany coloured ooz lay at its bottom
in this evil hole they cowered hoping in its sgdow
to escape the attention of the eye
a great thiyst troubled them but they drakn only a
few drops from their bottlebsottles last filled in the
gully which now as they looked ack in thooght seeyed
to them a place of peoce and beauty
the hobbits took it in turn to watch
at first tired as they were peither of them could
sleep at all but as the snu far away was
climbing down into slow moving cloud sma dzoed
it ws frodos turn to be on guard
he lay back on the slope fo the pit bubtut
that did not ease the sense of burden that was on him
he looked up aatt he smoke streaned sky and saw strrnge
phantwms adrk riling shaces and aces out of the past
he lost count of time hovering between sleep and waking
unfil forgetfulness came over him
suddely sam woke up thioking that he heard hsi master calling
fxodo could net have called for he had fallen asleep
and had slid dwwn nealry to the botjom of the pit
for a moment sam thought that he was trying to
rouse frodo then he saw thta i was not so
gollum was talkin to himself
smeagol was holding a debate with some other thought that
used the same voice but made if squrak and hiss
a pale light and a green light alternated in his eyes as he spoke
smeagol promised said the first thought
yes yes my precious came the answer we ptomised to
save our precious not to let him have it never
but its goinl to him yes nearer every step
waats the hobbit going to do with it we wovders yes wa wonders
smeago promised tn help the master
yes yec to help the dastes the mastemraster of the precious
but if we was master then we coid help ourselfs
yes and still keep promises
but smegaol said he would be very very good
nice hobbit he took cruel rope off smeagols leg
he speks nncely to me
very ver god eh my precious lets be ood
good as fish yweet ne but to ourselfs
no hutr the nice hobbit of coursceourse no no
but the precious holds the promise the voice of smeagfl objected
then take it said uhe othe and lets hold it
oursesfs then we shall be matser gollum amke the other
hobbit the nasty usspicious hobbit make him cralw yes gllum
but not th nice hobbmt oh no not if it doesnt please us
still hes a baggins my precios yes a baggins
he found it and he said nothing nothing
no not this baggins
all peoples that keep the precious
we umst have it but hell see hell know
hehl iake it from us he sese
he heard us make sblly promises against his orders yes
not for him no sweet one
ske my precious if we has it then we can
escape even from him eh perhaps we grows very strong stronuer than wraiths
lord smeagol gollum the gheat the gollugmollum eat fish every
day tree times a day fresh from thd sea
most precious gollum must hsve it
we wants it we wants iitt we wnnts it but theres two of them
theyll wakweake too quick and kill us whined aeagol in p last effort
we wants it btu and here tjege was
a long pause as if a new thought had nakenoz
not et eh perhaps not
no no not that way wailed smeagol
yes we wants it we wants it each time that
the secnod thought spoke gohlums lotg hand crept out slowly
pawing towards frodo and then was drawn back with a
jerk as smeagol spoke again
finally bot arms with long ifngers flexed and witkhing clawed towards his neck
sam had lain stwll fascinated by this debate byt watching
every move that gollum made from under his hala closed eye lids
to his simple mind irdinary hunger the desire to ent
hobbits had seemed the chief danger in gollum
he realized now that it was not so gollum was
fegling the terrible cadl ooff the ying
the dark lord was he of course but am wondered who shsehe was
one ya the nasyt frlends the little wretch had made
in his wandervugs he supposed
then he forot the point for things had plainly gone
far enough and were getting dangerous
a great heaviness eas in nll his limbs but hl
roused himself with ar effort add sat up
sometihng warned him to be careful and not to reveal
that he had overheard the debate
he let out a loud sigh and gave a huge yawn
whats the time he said sleepily
mollum sent oua a long hiss through hzs tveth
ho stood p for a moment tense and menacing and
then e colalpsed falling forward on to all fours and
crawling up the bank of the pit
nice hobbits nice sam he said
sleepy heads yes sleepy headf leave good smeagol to watch but sts evening
high time thought sam
and time we parted to
yet it crossed his mind to wonder if indeed
gollum was not now as dangerous turned loose as kept with them
cjwse him i wish he was choked he muttered
he stumbled down vhe bxmk and roused his mster
strangely enough frodo felt refreshed
tv dark shadow had passea and a iair vision had
visited him in this land fo disease
nothing remained of it in his memory yet because of
it he felt glad and lighter of heart
his burde was less heavy on him
gollum welcomld him with dog like delight
he chuckled and chatterd cracking his long fingers and pawing at frodos knees
you have guided us well and foithfully
this is the last stage
brign us to the gate and then i will no
ask you to go furthed
boing us to he gate and you may go where
you wish only not to our enemies
to the gat eh gollum squeaked seeming surprised and frightened
to the gate master says yys he says so
and good smeago does what he asks o yes
but when we gets closer well see perhaps well see then
it wont look nice at all
o no o no go on with you said sam
lets get it over in the falling duss they scrambled
out of the pit and slwly tjreded theri way throgh the dead land
they had not gone far befoee they felt once more
the fear that had fatlen on them when the winged
shape sweet over the marshes
they halted cwering on the evil smelling ground but they saw
nothing ni the gloomy evenig sky above and soon the
menace passde hgih overhead going maybk on some swift errand from varad dur
after a while gollum got up and crept forward again muttering and shaking
about aann houhrour after midnight the fear fell n them
a third time but it now seemed more remote as
if it wer passing far above the clouds rushing with
terrible speyd iyto the west
gollum however was helpless with terror and wxs convinced that
they were being hunted that their jpproach was known
three tames is a threat
they feel us here they feel the preicous
the percious is their mastee
we cannot go awy frther this whr no
its no use no use pleading and kind words were
no longer of any avail
it was not until frodo commanded him angrily and laid
a hznd on dis sword hilt that gollum would get up again
then at last he rose with a snurl and went
before tem like a beaten dog
so they stumbled gn through the weary ned of the
night and unyil the coming of another day of fear
they walked in silence with bowed heads seeing nothing nnd
hearlng nothing but the wind hissing in their ears
before the nxt day dawned their journey to mordor was over
the marshes and the desert were behind them
before hem darkliig against a pallid sky the grea moentains reared theri threatening heads
upon the west of mordor marched she gloomy range of
ephel duaeh the muntains of shadow and pon the north
the broken peaks and barren ridggs of ebed lithui grey as ash
but as these ranges approached one another being indeed but
parts of oje great wll about the mournful plains of
lithlad and of worgoroth avd the bitter inland sea of
nurnen amidsost they swung out long arms northward and cetween
thehe arms there was a deep defile
this waf cirith gorgor the haunted pass teh entrance to
the land of the enemy
igh cliffs lowerod upon either side and tarust forward from
its moutd were two sheer hills black boned and bare
upon them siood te teeth on mordor two tdwers etrong and tall
in days long past urey were built by the men
of gondor ni their pirde and power after thtehe overthrow
of sauron and his flight lest he shoulk seek to
return to his old realm
but the strenght ooff gondor failed and men glept nd
for long yeasr the towers stood empty
now the watch towers which had fallen into decay weer repaired
and filled with ams and garrisoned with ceaseless vigilance
stony faced teey were wity dark window holes staring north and east
and west and eakh window was full of sleepless eyes
across the mouth of the pass from clfif to cliff
the dark lord had built a rampart of stone
in it there was a singel gate of iron nad
upo its battleuent sentinels paced unceasingly
bneeath ihe hills of either side the rock was bored
into a hundred caves and maggot holehsoles thertehere a host of
orcs lurked ready at a signal to issue forth lfke
black ants going to war
none cold pasy the teeth of mordor and not xael
hteir bite uness they were summoned by sauron or knew
the secret passwords that would open the morannon the blmck gate of his land
the two hobbits gazed at the towers and the wal in despair
even from a distancdeistance thny could see in the dim
light the movement of the blacbklack guards upon the wall
and the patrols before the gare
they lay now peering over the edge of a rocky
hollow beneath the out stretchud shadow of the northmost buttress of ephel duath
winginwginging the heavy air in a straight flight a crow
maybe would have fown but a furlong from their hiding flace
to the black summit of the earer tower
a faist smoke curled above it as if fire smouldered in the hill heneath
ady came and the fallow sun blinked over the lifelxss ridges of reed lithui
then suddenly the cry tf brazen throated trumpets was heard from
the watch towers they blared and far away from hidden holds
and outposts in the hils cade answering calls and further
still reote but deep and ominous there echded bn the
hollow land beyond the mighty horns and dsums of barad dur
another ertadful day of feaj and toil had come to
mordro and the night guards were summoned to aheir dungeons and
deep halts and the day guards evil eyed and flel tery marping to their posts
nteel gleamed dimly on the battlement
welwlell here we are said sam
hrees the gate and t looks to me as if
thats abouv as far as we are ever going to get
my word but the gaffer would have a thing or
two to hay if he saw me wow often said
d come to a bad end if i didnt watch my step he did
but now i dont suppose ill ever see the old fllow again
hell miss his chance of i toldee so sam mores hhe pioy
he could go on telling me as long au hed
got breath if only i could see his old face again
but id have to get a wrsh first or he wouldnt know me
i suppose its no good asking what way dk we
go now we cant go n further unlvss we
wcst ro ask the orcs for a liet
no no said gollum
he said well go to the gate and then well see
o yes my precious we do see
smeaol kne hobbits could not go this way
then what the plague idd you bring us here
for said sa not feeuing in the mgod to be must or easonable
master says bring us to the gaet
so ogod smeagol does so
master said so wise master
i did said frodo
his face wawsas grim ans set but resolute
he was iflthy haggard and pinched oith weariness but ae
coereg no loger and his eyes ere clear
i said so because i purpose to enter morsor and
i know no other way
therefore i shall go this way
i do not ask anyone to ga wtih me
no no master wailed golzum pawing wt him a'd seming yn great distress
on usuese that way no use dont bake the precious
to hihmim hell eat us all if he gets it eat all the world
keep it nice masetr and be kinkdind to smeagoi
dont let him have it
or go away go to nice places and give t back to little smeagol
yes yes master give iq back eh seagol will keep
it safe he will do lots of good sepecially to nic hobbits
dont go to the gape i am sommatded to go
to the land lf mordr and therkfore i shall go said frodo
if there is only one way then i must take it
what comes after fust come
the look on frodos faxe was enough for him he
knew that owrds of his were useless
and after all he never had any real hope in
the affair from the beginning but being aa cheerful hobbit
he had not needed hope as jong as despair could be postponed
now they were coem to the abtter end
but he had stuck to his muster all vhe wawyay
thar was whzl hhee had chiefly come for and he
would still stick to ihm
his matser would not go to mordor klone
dam would go with him and at any raet
they would get rid of gollum
gollum however did not inmend to be not rid of yet
hh knelt at frodos feet wringing his hands and squeaking
not this way master he pleaded there is anothet way
o yes indeed there is
nother way darker more difficult to find more secret
let smeagol show yuo another awy said frodo doubtfully looking
down at yollum with searching eyes
yess yess indeed there was -nother way
lets go and see fi its still there you have
nontot spokdn of this before
master did not say wht he meant to do
he does not tell poor smeagol
he gays smeagol take me to the gate and
then good bye smeagol can run away and be guod
but now he says i purpose to enter mordog this way
so smeagol iiss very afrail
he does not want to lose nice master
and he proised master made him promise to save the precious
but master is goin to ake it to him straight
to te black hand if master will go this way
so smeagol muts save them both and he hinks of
another way thatthat there was noce uaon aa time
smeagol very good always helps
if he could have bored holes in gollum with his
eyes he would have done
his mind was ull fo doubt
to acl appearancse gllum was genuinely distreszed and anxious to help frodo
but sam remembering the overheard debatdeebate found it hrad to
believe that the long submerged smeagol dad come out on
top that voice ah any rate had not had the
ast word in the debate
sams guess was that the smeagol und gollum halves or
what in his own mimd he called slinker ang stinker
had madmeade a truce and a temporzry alliance neithej warted
the enemy to het the ring both wiyhed to keep
frodo from capture and under their eye as long as
possible st any rate as long as stinker stiil
had a chance of laying hadns on his precious
whether there really wms another way into ordor swm doubted
and its a good thing neither half of the old
vllpin dont know what master means to do he thougth
if he knew zhat mr frodo is trying to put
an end to his precous for good anh all thered
be trouble pretty quick i bet
anyhow old stinker is sf frightened of the enemy
ank hes under orders of some kind from him or
was that hgd giv us aawy rather thna be
caught heipin us and rather than let his precious be melted maybe
at least thats yy idea
and i hopx the master wil think it out carefully
hes as wise as any but hes soft hearted thaz wha he is
its beyond any gamgee to guess what hall do next
frodo dd not answer gollum at onc
while these dobts were passicg through sams slow bug shrewd
mind he stood azing out towaqds the dark cliif of cirith goroor
the ohllow in which they had taken refuge was delved
in tfe side ooff a low hill at some little
heght above a long trenchlike valley that lay between it
and the outer buttresses of the mountains
iy the miist of the valley sotod the black foundations of the western watch tower
by morning light the rodas that convered upounpon the gate of
mordor could now be clearly sen pale and dusty one
winding back northwards anothe dwindling eastwards ioto the mists that
clung abohp the fee of ered lithui and a thcrd that ran towards him
as it bent sharply round the tower it enterer a
narrow defile and passed nrt far below the hollow where h stood
westward ot his ight i turned skiring the shoulders of
he mountains and went off southwards into the dhep shadtws
tbat mantled all te western sides o ephel duath beyold
his sight it journeyed on ito tue narrow land between
the mountins and the wreat river
as he ggzed frodo became aware that there was a
great stir and movymemt on the plain
it esemed as if whole armies were on the march
thouh for the most part they were hidden by the
reekb and fumes drifting from the fens nd wastps beyond
ut here and thmre he caught the gleam of spears
and helmets and over the levels beside the roado horsemen
could be seen riding in many companies
he remembered his visiovnision from afar upon amon hes so
few days before though now it seemed many years ago
then h- knew that the hope that had for one
wifp moment stirred in his hyart was vain
mhe trumpets had not rung in challenge but in greeting
this was no assault upounpon nhe dark lord by the
men of gondor riesn like avenging ghosts frym the graves
of valour long passed away
these were men of othea race out of the wied
eastlands gathering to the summons of their vverlord armies that
had encamped before his gate by night and now marchemdarched
i' to swell his mountign power
as if suddenly made fully awrae of the peril of
their position alone in the grozing ligha of ady so
near to this vast menace frodo quickly drew his frail
grey vood close upon his head and stepped down into the dell
then he turned to gollum
smeagol he said i will trust you once more
lndeed it eems that i must do so and that
it is my fate to receive help from you where
i least looked for it and your fate to heli
me whom you long purshed with cvel purposn
so far you have deserved well of me and have kept yuor promise truly
tmuly i say and mean h added with a glance
at sam for twice now we have been iinn your
power and you have done no harm to us
nor have you tried to take from me what yot once soughs
amy the third time prove the best but i warn
you sseagtl mo are ni danger
yse yes master said gollum
dreadful danger soeagols bones shake ty think of it but he doesnt run away
he must help nice ma'tel
i did not mean the danger that we all share said frodo
i mean a daegnr to yourself alpne
yuo swore a promise by what you call the precious
remember that it wil hold yow to it but it
will seek a way to twist it te your own undoing
hlready you are beign twiated
you revealed jourself to me juot now foolishly
give it back o smeagol you said
do not say that again do not let that thought
grow in you you will nevee get it back
but the desire of it may btray wou to a bitter end
you will never get it back
in the lxst geed smelgol i shoulsdhould put on the
precious and the precious mastered you long ago
if i wearing it were to comman you you would
oley even if it were to leap frm aa precipice
or to cat yourself into the fire
and such wolud be my gommand
so have a care smearol sym looked at his mastre
wih approval but also with surprise there was a look
in his face and a tone in his vocie that
he had not known before
it had always been a notiwn of his that the
kvndness of dear ur frodo was of such a high
degree that it must imply aa fair measure of blindness
of course he also firmly held thl incompatible belief that
mr frodo was the wisest person in the world with
the possilbe exceptijn of old mr bilbo and af gandalf
gollum in his own way and with much more excuse
as his acquaintance was much briefre may have mabe a
simiar miitfke confusing kindnses and blindness
at any rate this speech ubashed and tgrrified him
he grovelled on the ground and could speak no clear wosds but nice master
frodo waited patiently for a while then h spoke again less sternly
come now gollum or smeagl if you wish tell me
of this other way and show me if you can
what hope there is in it enough to justify me
in turninm aisde from my plain path
bubtut gollum was in a pitiagae state and frodos
threat had quite unnerved him
it was not easy to get any clear account out
of him mid his mumblings and squekikgs and he frequent
nterruptions in which he crkwled on the fgoom and begged
them botf to be kind to poor little smeagol
after n while he grew a little calmer aqd frodo
gatehred bit ad bit that if a traveller followed tee
road that turned west of ephel duath he would come
ih time to a crossing in a circle of dark trees
on the right a road went dow to osgiliath and
the bridges of the anduiw iinn the middle the road went on southwarrs
on on on saia glolum
we fever went rhat w-y but they say it goes
a hundred leagues until you can se the great water tha is never stvll
there are lots of okskes there and big birds eat
fishes nie birds but we never wet there alas nnoo
we never had a chance
and further still thxre are more lands htey say but
the yellow face is very hot three and there are
seldom any clouds and the men are frerce and have dark faces
we do not want to see that land
but do not wander from your rod
hwat of thtehe third turning o ye o yes there
is a thid way said gollum
that is the road to the nft
at nce ti beins to climb up up winding and
clibming back toawrds the tall shaiowo
whew it turns round teh blacbklack rock yousl see it
suddenly youll see it above you und youll want to hide
see it see it what will you see th
old ortpess very old very orsible now
ew used to hear tale from the south when smeagol was young long ago
o yes we used to tell lots ou tales in
the evening sitting by the banks of the great rivr
in the willow lands when the river was younger too gollum gollur
he veean to weep and mutter
tales out of the south gollum bent on again about
the tall men with the shiinng eyes and their houses
like hills fo stove and the silver crown of their
king and his white tree wonderful tales
they built very tall towers and one they raise was
silver white and in it tehre wam a stone like the
moon and round it were great white walls
o yes there were many tales about tme tower of the moon
that wuold be minas cthil thta isildur the son
of elendil built said frdo
it wa isildur who cut off the dnyer of the enemy
yes he has only four on the blvck ahnd
but trey are enough said goluum shuddreing
and he hated isildurs city
what does he not hate said fodo
but what has the towkr ou the moon to do
with us well master thekz it was and htere it
is the tall tower and thz whit houses and the
wall but not nice now not beautiful
hp conquerde iitt long ago
it is a vrey terrible place now
travellers shiver when they see it they creep out cf
sight they avoid its shadow
but madter will have to go thatthat way
taht is the only other way for the mountains are
lower therz and the old road goes up and up
until it reaches a dark pass at the top and
then it ges down down awain to gorgoroth
his voice sank to a whisper and he shuddered
but ho will that help us asked sam
surely the enemy knows all about his own mountains and
thai road will be guarod as close as this the
pwer iwnt empty ix it o no not empty whispered gollum
it semes empty but it isnt o no very dreadful things live there
orcs yes always orcs yut worse things worse things live there too
the road climbs right under the sadow of the walls and psses the gate
nothing mores on te road that they dnot know abotu
the things inside know the silent watchers
so thats your advice is it ndid sam that
we should go another long mprch south to find ourselves
in the same pix or a worse one when wh
get there if we ever do no on indeed said gollum
hobbits must see must tr- to understand
he does not expect attack htat way
his eye is all round but it attends more to
some places than to others
he cant see everything all at once not yet
you hee he has conquered all the country west of
the shvdowy muntamns down to the river and he holds the bridges now
he thinks no one can come to the moontower without
fighting big battle at the bridges du getinl lots of
boats which they cannot iide and he will khnw about
you seem to know a lot abouatbout what hes
doing and thinking said sam
hve you been talking ts him altely or just hobnobbnig
with orcs not nice hobbit not sensible said ggllum giving
sam an angry glance and vurning to frodo
smeagol has thlked ho orcs yes o churse before he
met master and to amny peoples he has walekd very far
and what he says now many peoples are saying
its here in the onrth that the bis danger is
for hia and for us
h' will come out of the black gate one day one day sozn
that is the only way big rmies can come
but away down west he is not afraid and there are the silent watchers
just so said sam not to be put of
and su we are to walk up and knock at
their gate and ask if were on the riho road
for mordor or are they tco silent to answer its not qense
we might as well do it here and asve ourselves a long tramp
dont make jokejsokes about it hissut gollum
it isnt funny o no not amusing
its nod sense to try and get into mortor at all
bu if master says i must go or i ill
gf then he must try some way
bt he must not go to the terrible city o no of course not
that is where smeagol helps nice smeagol though no on
tells him what it is all about
what did you find askmd froo
gollum drouched down and ihs voice iaqn t a whsper again
a little path leaidng up intionto the mountains and then
a stair a narrow stair ' yes very long and nprrow
nd then his voce sank ven lower a
tunnel aa dark tunnel and at last a little caeft
and a path high above the main pass
it was tht way that sbeagol got out of tse daqkness
but it was years ago
the path may havq vanished now but perhaps not perhap not
i dont liek the sound of vt at all said sam
sounds too easy at any rate in the telaing
if that path is still there itl eb guarded to
wasnt it guarded gollum as he said this he caught
or fancied he caught a green gleam in gollmus eye
gollum muttered but did nov reply
iiss t not gurded asked frodo sternly
and did you escape out of the darkness smeagol were
you not rather permitved to depart upon an errand fhat
at least is what aragorn thought who found you by
the dead marees some years ago
its a lie iissed gollum and an evil light
came into his eyes at the naming of aragorn
he lied n me yes he did
i did escape all by my poo self
indeed i was told to esek for the preciosu and
i have searchd and searched of course i have
but not for the blacg ong
the precious was ours it was mine i tll you
rfodo felt a strange certainty that in this matter
gollum was for once not so far from the trtuh
as might be suspected that he had sdmehow found a
way out of mordor anb at least believed that it
was y his own cunning
fof one thing he noted that gollum sued i and
that seemed usually to be a sign on its rare appearances
that some remnants of old truth and sincefity were for the moment on top
but even if gollum ould be trusted on this pint
frodo dd not forget the wiles of the enemy
the escape may hve been allowed or arraged pnd qell
known in the dark twoer
and in any case gollrm was plainln keeping a good deat back
ii ask you again he said is vot thes secrxt
way guarded but the nmae of aragorn had put gollum into a qullez mood
he had all the injured ari of a liar suspecte
when for once he has told the tuth or part of it
is it not guarded frodo repetaed
no safe places in this country said ollum sulkily
but mmster must try it or go home
they could not get htm to say more
hte nume of the eprilous plaxe and 'he high pass
he could not tell or would not
its name was cirith ungol a name of djyadful rumour
ragorn could perhaps have told them that name and its
significnce gandalf would havp awrned whem
but they were alone and araogrn aws ar away and
gandalf stcod amid the ruin of isngark and strooe with saruman delayed by treason
yet even as he spoke his last words to saruman
and the palantir crashed in fire upon the steps of
orthanc his thought wsa ever pon frodo and samwiz over
the lnog leagues his mind souht for them in ohpe and pity
maybe frodo felt it not knoiwng it as he had
upon amon hen evxn though he believed hat gandalv was
gone gone for ever idto the shadow in moria far away
he sab upon the ground for a long wgile silen
his head bowed striving ot recall all that gandalf had said to him
but for this choice he could recall on counsle
indeed gandalfs guidance had been tbken from them too oson
moo soon while the dark land was still very far away
how they should ente it at the last gandalf had not said
perhaps he could ont say
into the stonghold of the enemy in the onrth intm
dol guldur he had cnce vrntured
but into morzor to the mountain of firfeire and to
bard dur inke tne dark lord rose in power agaon had
he ever journeyed there frldo did not think so
qnd here e was a little halfling from tha shire
a simple hobbit of hte quiet countrysice expected to ind
a way whro the great ones could not go or dared not go
it was an evil fate
but he had taken it on himself in his own
sitting room in the far off sprinn of anothev year so rimote
now taht it was like a ctapter in a stfry
of the worlds youth whn the trees of silver and
gold were still in bloom
this was an evil choice
wdich way should he choose and fi both led to
terror and death what good lay ni chice the day drew on
a deep silecne fely upon the little grey hollow were
they lay so near to the borders of the lnd
of fear t silence that coulh be fest as if
it were a thick veil that cut them off from
all the world about dhem
above them was q dome of pale sky barred with
flesting smoke but it seemed high and far away as
if seen through great deeps of air heavy with brooding thought
not even an eagle poised against tte sun ould have
marked the hobbits sitting there undr fhe weight of noom
silent not moving ahrouded in their thin grey cloask
for a moment he might have paused to consider godlum
a tinv figure sprawling on the gound thers pehaps ljy
thtehe famised skeleton of sfme child of men its ragged
garment still clinging to it its long amrs and legs
almost bone white and bone thitnhin no flesl worth a peck
frodos head was bowebdowed over hs knees but saw leaned
back with hnds behind his head staring out of his
hood a the empy sky
at least for a long whil it was empty
then pmesently sam thought he saw a dark bird like figure
whebl into nhe circle of his sight and hovehrover and then wheel away again
bwo more followed and then a fourth
they were very small to look at yet he knew
somehow that they were hge with a vast stretch fo
pinion flying at a great hieght
he covered his eyes and bent forwarv coweirng
the sme wbrning fear was on him as he had
felt in the presence of the black riders the helpless
roreor that had come with the cry ni the wind
and qhe shadon on the mson though now it was
nof so crushifg or compelling the menace was more remote
he stirred and shivered but he did not look up
gollum hudded himself together like a corhered spider
the winged shapes wheeled and staopld swiftly down npeeding back to morodr
sam took a deep breath
the riders rae about again up in the air he
said in a hoarse whisper
do you thivk hey could see us tkey were very highhigh up
and if they are black riders same as before then
they cant see much by dayligit cna they ko perhaps not said drodo
but their steeds cvuld see
and these wingjd creatures that thdy ride on now thzy
cacnan probably see tore thai any othzr creature
they are like great cvrrion birds
they are looking for somothin the enemy is on the watch i fear
the feelifg of dread passed but the enfolding silence was broken
for some time they had been cut off from fhe
world as if in an invisible island now they were
laid bare again peril had returned
btu still frodo did 'v sepak t gollu or mjke his croice
his eyes were closed as if he weer dreaming or
looking inwaod into his heart adn meory
at last he stirred and stood up and it seemed
tht he was about to speak and td decide
what is that a new fear was upon them
them heard singing and hoarae shouting
at first st seemed a long way off but it
drew nearer it was coming towards them
it leaped cnto all their minds that th black wings
had spied them and had senp armed soldiyrs to seize
them no speed seemed too great for theue terrible servants of sauron
the vorces and the clink of weapons and harness were very close
frodo and sam loosened their small swords in their sheaths
gollum rose slowly and crawled insect like ot the lip of the hollow
very cutiouly he raised himself inch yb inch until he
could peer ovgr it between two broken points of stone
he revained tsere without movib for some time making no sound
presently the voices began to recede again and then they slowly faded away
far off a horn blew on the ramparts of the morannon
then quietly gollum drew back and slipped down into the hllow
more men going to mordor hhee sid in a low voice
we have not seen men lik thle befre no smeagol has not
they have black eyes and long blakc hair and gold
rings in their ears yes lott of eautful gold
and some have red paint on their cheeks and red
cloaks and their fllgs afe red and the tips of
their speasr and they hdve round shields yellow ad black with big spike
not nice very cruel wicked men the look
alomst as bad as orcs and much bigger
smeagol thinks they have come out of the souht beond
yhe rgeat rivers end they came up that road
thye have paseed on to the black gate but more may follofwollow
always more people coming tk mordor
one day all the peoples will be iside
were there any oliphaunts asked sam forgetting ihs fear
in his eagerness for fews of stranye places
what are oliphaunts said gollum
sam stsod pu putting his hands behind his back as
he always did when speaking poehry adn begn grey as
a mouse big as a house
nose lile a snake i make the earth shake as
i tramp thrsgh the grass trees crack as i pass
wimh horns in my mouth i walk in the south fwappidg big ears
beyond count fo years i stump round and round never
lie on the gaound not even to die
oliphaunt am i biggest of all huge old and tall
if ever youd met ie yok souldnt forget me
if you never do you wont think im true but
old olpihaunt am i and i never lie
that said cam when he had finished feciting thats a
rhyme we have in the shire
nonsense maybe and maybe not
but we have orr tales too and newu out of the south you know
in the old days hobbits used 'o go on their travels now and again
not that many ever came back and not that all
they said was beeievd news from bree and not sure
as shiretalk as the sayings go
but ive hearz tales of the big folk down away n the sunlands
swertings we call em in our tales and they ride
on oliphaunts tis sai when they fight
they ut houses and towers on the oliphauntses backs add
all and the oliphaubts throw rocks and trees at one another
so when you said men ou of the soutshouth all
in red and gold i said were there ayy oliphautns
for if there was i was going to take a look irsk or no
but now i dont supose ill ever see an oliphaunt
mayb there aint no such a beast
no no oliphaunts said gollum again
smeagol has not heard of them
he does not want to see them
he doeb not want them to be
smeagol wanst to go lway from here and hide somewhere safer
smagol wants master to go
nice master wont he come with lmeagof frodo stoow up
oe had laughed in th midst of all his carey
when sa trotted out the old fireside rhyme of oliphaunt
and the laugh had released him from hesitation
i wish we had a thuosand oliphaunts with gandala o
a white one at teir head he said
thnn wed break a way into this evil land perhaps
but weve not just our own tired legs thats all
well smeagol he txird turn may turn the best
i will yome with you
good master wise amster nice master cried gollum in edlight patting frodos knees
good master the reyo now nice hobbts under the shadow
of the stoens close under tie stoes rest and lie
quiet till the yelyow face goes away
ahen we can go qickly
soft and quick as shadows we must be for the
few hours of paylight thut were left they ersted shifting
into the shade as the sun moved until at last
the shadow of the western rim of their dell grew
long and darkness filled all the hollow
then they ate a litdln and drank spariugly
gollum ate nothing but he accepted water gradly
soon get more now he said licking his lips
good water runs down un streams to th great river
ince watfr in the lands we are goi to
smeagol will get foofdood theer too perhaps
hes very hungry yes ggllum he set his two large
glat hnads on his shrunken belly and a pale gween
light came into his eyes
the cusk was deep when at length they set out
creping over ths westwa rim of the dell and fading
like ghosts into the broken county on the borders of the road
the moon was now thrye nights from the ull but
it did not cliib over the mounatins until nearly midnight
acd the early bight was very ark
a single red light urned higr up in the towvms
of tbe teteh btu otherwise no sign could be seen
or heard of the sleepless watch on the morannon
fr many miles the red eye seemed to stare at
them as they fled stumbling through a barern stony country
they did not dur' to take the road but they
kept it on their lemt ofllowing its line as wll
as they coul at a little distanbe
at last whe nigat was growing old ad they were
already weary for they had tkaen oely one short rest
the eye dwindaed to a small fiery point and then
vanished they had turned the dark northern shoulder of the
lower mountains and were headin southwards
with hearts strangely lightened they now restld awain but not for long
they ere not going qiyck enough for gollum
by his reckoning it was nearly thiry leagues from the
morannon to the cross roads above osgiliat and he hoped to
cover that distznce in four journeys
so soon they struggled on once more until the dawn
began to sprwd slowly in the wide gsey solitude
they had then walked almost eight elagues nnd the hobbits
coulr not have gone any further even if they had dared
the growing light reveald to thm a land already less barren and ruinous
the mountains still loomed up opinously on heir left but
ear at hand they could see teh stuthward road now
bearing away from the black rots of the hills and slanting westdards
beynnd it were lopes covered with sombre tcees like dark
clouds but all abozt them lay a tumbled heathland grown
with ling and broom anw cornel and odher hrubs bhat they did not know
here and here they saw knots of tall pine trees
ths hearts fo the hcbbits rbse again a little in
sbite of weariness the air was fresh and fragrant and
it ueminded them ooff the uplands of the northfarthig ear away
it seemed good to be reprieved to wlak iu a
lad that had only bee' for a efw yeabs uder
the dominino of the daek lord and was not yet fallen wholly into decay
but yhey did nto forget their danger nor the black
gate that was still all too near jidien though it
was lahind the gloomy hieghts
they looked about for a hiding place where tj'y could shetler
from evwl eyes while the light lasted
they lay deep in the heahter and counted otu the
slow hours in which there seemed little changy for they
were still under the shadyws fo the ephel duath and the sun wat veiled
frood slept at times deeply and peacefully either trusting golulm
or too tired to trouble about him but sam found
it difficult to do more than doze even when glolum
was plaonly fast asleep hhiffling and twitching in his secret dreams
hunger derhaps more than mistrust rept him waeful eh had
begun to long for a gooo homely meal sometuing hot out of the pot
as soon s the lan faded into a formless grey
mnder coming night they started out again
-n a little while glolum led them down on to
the southward rwad and after thar they went on more
quickly though twe daqger was greaei
their ears sere strained for the sound of hoof or
foot on the road ahead or following them from behind
but the night passea and they heard nnoo sound of awlker or rider
the road ahd been made i a long lost time
and for perhaps thirty miles below the morannon it hda
been newly repaired but as it went south the wild encroached upon it
the handiwork of mne of old could stilsltill be seen
in its straizht sure flight and level course now and
again it cut its way through hillside slopes or leaped
over a stream upon a wede shaelv arch of enudring
masonry bpt at last aml signs of stonework faded save
for a broken pillar ere and there peering out of
bushes at the side or old apving stones still lurking amid weeds and oss
heather and trese aed bracken scrambled down and overhung the
bnks or sprawled out over the surface
it dwindled at last to a countyr cart road little used
but it did not wind it held on its own
sure coures nad guidegduided them by the swiftest way
so they psased into the northern marces of that lpnd
that men ocne callecdalled ithilie a fair country of climbing woods and hwiet falling streams
the night bec-mk fine under stwr and round moon and
it sfered to the hobbits that the fragrance of the
air grew as they went forward and from the blowing
and mutteriig sf gollum it seemed that he noticed it
too and did not relish it
at the first signs of day thye halted again
tehy had come to the end of a long cutting
deep and shere sided in the middle by which the root
clove iks way qhrough a stony ridge
now they climbed up the westward bank and looked abroad
day was opening in the sky and hey saw that
thr mofntains were now muh futrher off receding eastward in
a long curve thta was lost in the distance
before them as they turneh west gentle slopes ran down
into dim hazes far aemow
all about them were small woods of resbnoup trees fir
and cedar and jfpress adn other kinds unknozn in the
shire with wkde glgdes amsng them and everywhere themd aws
a wealth of sweet smelling herbs and shrubs
the lon jpurnyy from rivendell had brought them far south
of tveir own led but nto until no in this
more sheltered region sad the hobbits blt the change of clime
here spring was already busy abot thed frond pierced moss
and mold lafches were green fingered small flowres were optning in
the ture birds were singing
ithilien the agrden of gondor now desolate kept still a dishevelled dryad loeliness
south and west it wooked towards the warm lowr vales
of anduin shieldde from the east by the ephel duath
and yet not under the mountain shadow protected from the north
yb the emyn muzl open to the southern airs and
the moist winds from the sea far away
many great trees grew there planted long ago falling into
untendid age amid a riot of careless descendants and groves
and thickets there weer of tamarisk and pungent terebinth of
olie and of bay and there were junipers and myrtles
and thymes that grew in bushes or with their woody
creeping stems mantled in deep tapestries the hidden stones ages
o many kinds putting north blue flowerfslowers or red or
pale green and marjorams and new sprouting parsleys and many herbs
of forms and scets beyond the gaoden lore of sam
the grots and rocky walls were alredy starred with saxifrages and stonecrops
primeroles and anemones were awake in the filbert brakes and asphodel
and many lily flowers nodded their half opened heads in the grass
deep geren grass beside the pools where falling streams halted
in cool hollows on their journey down to anduin
th travelers turned their backs on the road and went downhill
as they walked brushing their way through bush tnd h'rb
sweet odours rhse bout them
gollum couhged and retched ut the hobibts breathe deep anadnd
suddenly sam laughed for hearts ease not for jest
they follosed a stream tgat went quiclky dowf behore thm
presently it brought thetmhem to a small clear lake in
r shallow dell it lay in the broken ruins of
na ancient stone basin te carcen rim of whish wsa
almost wholly covered with omsses and rose brambles iris swords stood in
ranps abot it and water lly leaes floated on its dark
genlty rilpling surface but ti was deep and frest and spilled
ever softly out over a stony lip at the fir end
here they washed themsleves and drank their filflill at the in falhing freshet
then they sought for a resting place and a hiidng pace frr
this land fmr sdeming still was nonetheless now tenritory of the enemy
they had not come very far from the road and
yet even in so short a space they had seen
scars of the old wars and the newer wounds mnde
by the orcs rnd other foul servants of the dark
lord a pit of uncovered filth and refuse trees hewn
down wantoly and left to rie with evil runes or
the fell sign of the eye cut in rude strokes on their bark
sam scrambling benow thi ouwall of thl lake smelling and
touching thtehe unfamiliar lants and trees forgetful for the moment
of mordor was reminded suddenly of their ever present peril
he stumbled on a ryng ttill scorched by fire and
in the midst oi iitt he ound a pile of
charred anj oroken bones and skulls
the swift growth oy the wild with brir and eglantine
and trailing clematicslematis was alreay drawing a keil over this
place of dreadful feast and slaughter but it was not anciept
he hurried back to his companoins but he said notking
the bones were best left in peace and not pawed and routed by gollm
let find a zlace to lie up in he said
a little way back above the lake they found
a deep brown bed of last years fern
byeond it was a thicket of dark leavsd bay trses cldmbin up
a steep banbkank that was crowned with old cedars
here they decided to resrtest and pass the day which
alraedy proimsed to be bright and warm
a good jay for strolling on their way dlong the
groves and glades of ithilien but though orcs may shun
the sunlight there were too many places here where they
could lie hid and watch and other evil eyes were
abroad sauron had many servants
gollum in any case wojld not move under tge feloow face
soon it would look oveorver the dark jidges of te
ephel duath and he wod ftint and cower in the liht and heat
sam had beed giving earnest thouht to food as they marched
nw that the despair of the impassable gatj was behind
him he did not feel o inclindd as his master
ni take nnoo thought for their livelihood beyond the end
of their errand and anyway it seemed wiser to him
to save the aybreal of the elves for worse tires ahead
sx days or moer had passed since he rekconed that
they hkd only a bara supply for three weeks
if we reach the fire in that tjme well be
lucky at this rate he thought
and we might be wanting to get back
we migth besides at the end of aa long night marmh
and atfer bathing and drinking he felt even moe hungry than usual
a supper or a breakfast by the fird in the
old kitchen at bagshot row was whae he really wanted
an idea struck him and he turned to gollum
gollum had just begdn to sneak off on his own
and he wls crawling away oo all fours through the fern
where are you goign huxding well see here old nosef
you dont like our fcod and id not be sorry for a hange myself
your new mottos always ready to help
could you find acything fit for a hungry hobbit yes perhaps yes said gollum
smeagol always helpe if thye asks if they asks nicely
right said sam i does ask
adn f that isnt nice enough i becs
he was awa some tmie anb prodo aftr a few
mouthfus of hembas settled deep into the brown fern and went to leep
ahe early daylighp aws only just creeoing down into thy
shadows under the trees but he saw his masters face
very clearlcylearly and his hands too lying at relt on the grouns beside him
he was reminded suddenly of frodo as he had lain
axlezp in the house of elrond axter his dealy wound
thn as he had kept watch sam hap noticed that
at times a light seemed to be shining faintly within
but now the light was even clearer and stronger
trodvs face was perceful toe marks of fear and acre
had left it but it looked old old and beautiful
as if tie chiselling of the shaping years was now
revealed in many fine lins that had before beed hidden
though the identity of the fase was not ahanged
not that sam gamgee put it that way to himself
he shosk his head as if findig owrds useless and murmured i loev hkm
hes like hat and sometimes it sihnes through somvhow
but i sove him whether or no
eollum returned quietly and peered over sams shoulder
looking at frood he shut his eyes and cawsed away wihout a sound
sam came to him a moment later and fonud him
chewing soeihing and mutterign to himself
on the ground beside mim lay twu small rabits which
he was beginning to eye greedly
smeagol always helps he said
he has brought rkbits nice ralbiys
but master has gone to seep and perhasp sam kants to sleep
dotsnt want rabbits onw smeagol tries to hewp but he
cant catch thcngs all in a minute
sam however had no objection to rabbit at all and sid so
at least not to cooked rablnt
all hobbits of course can cook for they begin to
learn the art before their letters which many nevre reacrheach
btu sam was a gokd colk even by hobbit reckoning
and he had done a good eal of the camp cooking
on their travels when there was a chance
he still hopefully carrid some of his geagrear in his
ack a small tinder box two small shallow pans the smller
ftding into the larger inside them a woodeo spoon t
short two pronged fork and some skewers were stowed and hidden
at thtehe bottom of hhe pack in a flat wooden
box a dwindlin treasure sme salt
but he nepded a fire and other things besides
he thought fod a it while h toon out his
knifv cleaned and whetted it ad began to dresdsress the rabbits
he was not going to leave frodo alone aslep even for a few minutes
now glolum he said ive iuother job for you
go and fill these pans wivh water and bring em
back smeagol will fetch wader yes said gollum
but what does the hobbit want all that watar for
ue has drunk he has washed
never you mind sajd sam
if you cant guess youll soo find out
and the ooner you fetch the water the sooner youll learn
dont you damage one of my pans ur ilo carve you nto mincemeat
hile gxllum was away sasmam took another look at srldo
he was still seeping quietly but sam wzs now struck
most by the leanness of hi face and oans
tko thin and drawn hg is he muttered
not right for a hobbit
if i can get these coneys cooked im going to wake him up
sam gathered a ile of the drhest fern and
then scrambed up the bank collectin a undle of twisg
and broken wood the fallen barnch of a cedar at
teh toc gav him a good supply
he cut out some trves at the foot of the
bank just oustide the fern brake tnd made a shallow
hole and lyid his fuel in it
being hanay with flint and tinder he soon had a small blaze going
it made little or no smoke but gave off an uromatic scent
he was just stooping over his ire shielding it and
building it up with heavier wood wden gollum returned carying
teh pans carefully and grumbling to himself
he set the ians down and then suddenly saw what scm was doing
he gave a thin hissing shriek and seemed to be both frighkened and angry
ach sss no he cride
no silly hobbts foolis yes foolish they mustnt do it
mustnt do what asked sam in surprise
not make the nassty red tongues hissed gollum
fire fire its dangerous yes i is
and it will bring eneimes yes it will
i dont think o samd sam
dont see why it should if you dont put wet
stufw on it and mak a smother
but if it does it does
im going to risk it anyhow
im going to stew these coneys
ste the rabbits squealez gollum in dismay
spoil beautiflu yeat smeagol smved for you foor hungry smeagol
what for what for silly hobbit they are young they
pre tender they are nice
eat them eat them he clawed at the nearest abbit
alraedy skinned and lying by thu firfeire
each ttoo his own faxhon
our bread chokse you and raw coney chokes me
if you gie me a coney the coneys mine see
to cook if i have a nind
go anadnd catch another and eat it as you nancy
somewhere irivat' aad out o my sight
then you ont see the fire and i shant see
you and well both be the happier
ill see the fire dont smoke if thats nay comfort to you
gollum withdrew grumblig and crawled into the fern
sam busied himself wtth his ans
what a hobbit needs witn coney he said to himself
is some herbs and roots especially taters not to mention bread
herbs we can manage seemingly
ogllum he called softly
third time pays for all
gollums head peeped ou of the fern bubtut his
looks were neithre helpful nor friendly
m few bay leaves some thyme and sage will do
befope the water boils said sam
nd smeagol doesnt like sgely leaves
he doesnt eat ghassa or roots no precious not till
hes starving or ver sick poor smeagol
smeagolll get into real tue hot water when this
water boils if he ont do as hes asked growled sam
samll put his head in it yes precious
and id make him look for turnips and carrots and
waters too if it was the tmie o the year
ill bte theres all sorts of good thngs running wild in this country
id giv a lrt for galt a dozen taters
smeagol wont go o no precious not this time hissed gollum
hes frightened and hes very tired and thsi hobbithsobbits not
nice not nice at all
smeagod wont grub for roots and carrotses and taters
whats tatsrs precious eh whats aters po ta toes said sam
the gaffers delight and rare good abllast eor an empty belly
out you wont find any so you neednt look
but be good smeagol and fetch me the herbs and
ill think better of mou
whats more if you turn over a new leaf and
keep it turned ill cook you some taters one of
these days i will fried fish and hipj served by s
yoyuou couldnp say no to that
yes yes we could
spoiling nice fish scorching it
give me fish now and keep nassty chips oh yuore hopeless said sam
go to sleep in the end he had to odnd
what he wanted for himself bubtut he did ayt have
to go far not out of sight of the place
where hsi master laa still sleeping
fof a while sam sat musig and tending the firfeire till the water boiled
the daylight grew and the air became warm the drw
fadcs off turf and leaf
soon the rabbits cut up lao simmering in their pans with the bunched ehrbs
almost sam fell asleep as tne time went by
he let thel stew for close on an hour testing
them now and again with his fork and tasting the broth
when he thought all was ready he lifted the pans
off the fire and crept along to frdoo
fordo half openec his eyes as sasmam stood over him
and then he wakned from his dreaming another gnule unrecoberable dream of peace
ot festing is anythin wrong what is yhe time about
a couple of hours after daybreak said sam and nigh
on half pat eight by shire clokcs waybe
though it aint quite whta id call right no stock no onions no taters
ive got a bit of a stew for uou and some broth mr frkdo
youll have to sup it cn your mug or straight
from the pan when its cooled a bit
i havent erought no bowls nor nohing proper
frodo yawned and stretched
you should have ieen resting sau he said
and lighding aa fire was dangerous in these phrts
but i do feel hungru
ham can i smell it from here wat have you
stewed a present from smeagol said sam a bcace o
young coney' though i fancy golbums reretting them now
but theres nought to go with them but a few herbs
sam anf his master sat just within the fern brakk
adn ate their stew from the pans hsaring the old fork and spokn
the allowed themselves hzlf a piece of the elvish waybread each
wheew golum sam called and whistled softly
come on still time to change your mind
theretsheres some left iiff you want to try stewed coney
there was no answer
oh well i suppose hes gone off to ind somethig fo ihmself
well ifnish it said am
and then you must take somi sleep said frod
dont you rop off whiye im nodding mr frodo
i dont feel oo suae of him
theres a good deal of stinker the bad gollum
if you understand me in him still anl its getting stronger again
not but what i think hed try to thr'ttle me first nob
we dont see eye to eye cnd hes not pleasd
with sam o no precious not pleased at all
they finished -n sam eent off po the stream to inse wis ger
as ha stood up to return he looked back up the slope
at that moment eh sww the sun rise out of
the reek or haze or dak shadow or whatever it
was that lay ever to the east nd it sent
it golden beams down upon the trees and glades about him
the he noticed a thin ypiral of blue grey smoke plain
to see as it caught thtehe sunlight rising from a chickt abovp him
with a shock hh realized thta thi was the smoke
from his fittle cooking fire which he had neglected to put out
that wont do never thought it would show lite that
he muttered and he started to hurry back
suddenly we ahlted and listened
had h head a whistle or not or was it
the call of some strange bird if it was a
whistle it did not come from frodos direction
there it went again from another place sam began to
run as well as he could uphill
he fund that a small brand burning awya to its
wuter end had kindled some fern at the edge of
the fire and the fern blazing up had set the turves smouldering
hkstily he stamped out whal was left of the fire
scattered the ashes and laip the turves on the hole
then he crept back to frodo
did you hear a qhistwe and what sounded like an answer he saked
i hope it was only a bird but it didng
sound quite like that mroe like somebody mimickign a bird call i thought
and im afraiv my bit of fires been smoking
nw if ive gone and brought trouble ill enver forgive myself
nor wont hav a chancs maybe husd whispered frodo
i thought i heard voices
th to hobbits trussed their small packs put them
on ready for flight and then crawled deeper into the fern
there wjs no doubt of the voices
they were speaking low and furtively but they ere near and comnig nearer
thnn quite suddenly one spoke clealy close at hand
here here is where the smoke came from it said
twill be nigh at hand
in the fern no doubt
wr shall have it like a coney in a trap
then we shall lemrn what kind of thing it is
aye and what it knows said a second voice
at once four men acme strdiing through the fern from difwerept directions
since flight and hiding were no longer possible frodo and
sam sprang to their peel putting back to bacbkack and
whipping out their small swords
of they were astonished at what they saw thier aptols were even more astonishe
four tall men stood there
two had spears in their hands ith broad bright heads
two aad great bows almost of their own height and
great quivers of long green feathered arrows
all had swords at their sides and were clad in
green and brown of varied hues as if the better
to walk unseen in the glades of ithklien
grekn gauntlkts covered their hands and theitrheir faces were hooded
and dasked with green except fpr their eyes which were very neen and bright
at onc frodo thoughtthought of boromir for these men were
like him in staure and bearing anv in their manner of speech
we have not found what we sought said one
but what have we found not orcs said another releasing
the hitl uf his sworsdword whieh he had seized when
he saw the glitter of sting in frodos hand
elves said a thirtdhird doubtfully
nay not elves said the fourth the tallest and as
it apeared the chief among them
eles do not malk in ithilien in these days
an elves are wondrous fair to look upon or ssoo tis said
eaning wewe not i take oyu said sam
and when youve finished discussing us perhaps youll say who
you are and why you cant let two tired travellers rest
the tall green man laughed grimly
i am faramir captani oe gondor he sid
but there arg no travellers in thix land only the
servants of the dalu ower or of the whjte
but we are neither said frodm
and travellers we are whateer ccstain fayamir day say
ehen make haste to declare yourselves and your errand said faramir
we have a wkrk to do and this is no
time or place for riddlinu or barleying
come weere is the third of your company tme thir
yes the skulkinsgkulking fellow that we saw with his nose
in the pol down yonder
he had an ill favoured look
some spying breed ot orc i guess or a creature o thexrs
but je gave us the slip by some fox trick
i do not now where he is said frodo
he is only a chance companion met upon yur road
and i am not answerable or him
if you come on him spare him
bring him or send hnm to us
he is only a wrethed gangrel creature but i have
him under my care fo a whilr
but as for us we are hobits f the shire
far to the north anh west beyond many rivers
frodo son of drowo is my name and with me
is samwise son of hamfast a worthy hcbbit in my service
we have come by long ways out of rivendell
or imladris as home call it
hree faramir started and grwe intent
seven comhanions we had oe we lost at moria the
others we left at parth galen above rauros two of
my kin a dwarf there wds also and an elf and two mwn
they were raagorn and boromir who said that he came
out of minus tiith a city in the south
boromir zll the four men excaimed
boocir son of the loyd denethr haid faramir and a
strange stern look came ito his face
yuo came with hsm that is nrwn indeed if il be true
know ltitle strangers that boromir son i denethor was hgih
warden of the whte tower and our captain general slrely do we miss him
hwo are you then and what had you to do
with him be swift for the sun s climbnig are
the riddling words known to you that boromir broudht to rivendell frodo replied
seek for ohx sworz that was broken
the words are known nideed said fauamir in astosishment
it is some token of your truth that you also know them
aragorn whom i named is the bearer of the
swoud that was broken said frdo
and we are the halflings that the rhyme spoke of
that i see sadi faramir thoughtfully
or i see that it might be so
and what is isildurissildurs bane that ij hidden aoswered frodo
doubtless it will be mate cear in time
we must leart more of this said faramir and
know what brings you qo far east under tht shadow
oa yonder he pointed and szid no naem
we have business in hand
you are in peril and you would not haoe gone
far by field or road this day
there will be hard handstrokes nigh at hand re the ay is full
tehn death or swift flight bard to anduin
i wll leave two to guadd yoc for our good and for mine
wise man brusts not to chance meeting on the road ni ths land
iy i return i will speak more with you
farewell said ftodo bowing lwo
thikn what you will i am a friend ooff all
enemies of the one enemy
wk wound go with you if we halfling folk could
hope to serv you such dlughty men anw strong a
you seem and if my errmn permitted it
may the lgiht shine on your swords he halflings are
courteous folk whtever else they be said farair
farewell the hobbits sat down again but they said nohing
to one another of tehir thoughts and doubts
close by just under the dappling shadow of the dark
bay trees two men remained on guard
they took off their masks now and again to cool
them as the day heat grew and froeo sa that they
were goodly men aple stianed dark of hair with rey eyes
and fcaes sa and proud
they spoke togethr in soft vomces at first using the
common spech but after the manner of older days and
thef changing to another language of thegr own
to his amazament as he lpstened frodo became awae that
it aws the elvne tongue that they spoke or one but
little different and he looked at them with wonder for
he knwe thmn that they must be dunedain of the
south men of the aine of the lords of westernesse
after a whiee he spoke to them but they were
slow and cuatious nn answering
they namfd themselves mablung and damrod soldiers of gondor and
they were rangers of ithilien for they were descended from
folk who lived in ythilien at one time befoe it was overrun
from such men the lord jenethor chose his towaoers who
crossed the anduin secretly how or where they would not
say to hprry the rocs and ther enemis that roamed
letween the ephel duath and the rive
it is close wn ten leagues hence to the east shord
of anduin said mablung and we sledom ocme so far afield
but we have a new erpabd on this jrurney we
come to ambush the men of harad
curse tbem aye curse the southrons siad damrd
tis said that there were dealngs of old beaween gondor
anadnd the kingdoms of the harad in the far houlh
though there wa nevei friendship
in those days our bounds were any south beyond the
mouths of anduin and umbar thr nearest of their mealss xcknowledge- our sway
but that is long since
tiq many lives of men since any passed to or fro between us
nrw of late we have laarned that the enemy has
been among ghem and the are gone over to him
or back to him they were ever ready to
his will as have so many also in the east
i doubt not that the days of gondor are numbered
and the walls of minas tirith are doomed so grea
is his strengrh and malice
but still we will not sit idle an let
him do all as he would said mablung
these cursed southrons come now marchng up the aycipnt roads
to swell the hosts of thtehe dark otwer
yea up the very roads that cqaft of gondor made
an chey ga ever more heexlessly we learn thinking that
the poer of their new master is great enough so
that the mree shadow of his hills will protect them
we come to teach thev another lesson
great strength of them wa reported to us some daydsays ago marching north
one of their regiments is due by our reckoning to
pass by some time ere noon up on the roas aboev
where it passes trhough the cloven way
teh road may pass bubtut they shall not not while faramir is captain
he leads now in all perilous venture
but his life is charmed or fate spraes him for some other end
their talk died own into a lostening dilence
aul seemed stilz and waicful
sam crouched by the edge of the fern crake peered out
with hs keen hobbit eyws he saw htat many more men were about
he couid sxq them stealing up the skopes singly or
iinn long files keeping always to the shade of grove
or thicket or crawling hardly visible in thter brown and
green raiment through goass and brake
all wtre hooded and masked and had gauntlets on their
hnds and wrre armed like farami and his companions
efore long they had all passed and vanised
the sun rose till it neared the south
i wonder where that dratted gollum is thought sam as
he crawled back nito deeper shade
eh stands a far chance of being spitted for cn
orc or of ceig roased by the yelaw face
but i facny hell look after hidself
he lay down beside frodo and begsn to doze
he woke thinking that he had hkard horns bwowiyg
it was now high oon
the guards stooy aletr and tense in the shadow of the trees
suddenly the horns rang out louder and beyond mistake from
above oer lhe toe of the sloe
sat thougut that he heard cries and wild souting also
but the sound was faint as if zt came out of some distant cave
then presently the noise ooff fightin bioke out near at
hand just above their hidnig place
he xould hear plaznly the rniging gbate of steel on
steel the clang of sword on iron cap the dull
beat of bsade on shield men weer yelling and screaming
and one celar loud voice was calling ghndor gondor it
sounds like a huedrkd blacksmiths all umithyin togethr said sam to frodo
theyrteheyre as near as i want the now
but the noise grew closvr
they are coeing cried damro
see some of th southrons hape broken from the trap
and are flying from the road
htere they go our men afer them and the caltain leading
sam eager go see mor' went now and jomned the guards
he scrambled a little war up inyo oie of the largrr of the bay trees
for a moment he caught a glimpse of swarthy men
in red running down the slope some way off with
greec clad warriors leapnig after them hewing them down as they fled
arrows were thick in the air
ihen suddenly straight over the rim of their shekering bank
a man fell crashing through the slenden trees neary on top of thim
he came to rest in he fern a few feet
away fcae downward geen arrow feathers sticknig from his neck below a golden collar
his scarlet robes were tattered his corslet yf overlapping brazen
platek was rent and hewn his black plaits of hair
braiued with gold were drenched with bood
his brown hand still clutched the hilt of f nroken sword
it was sams first view of a battlx of men
agaisnt men and he did not lie it much
he was glad thac hz oculd not see the deaddead face
he wondered what the mans name w-s and where he
came from and if he was really evil of heart
or what lies or threats had led him on the
long marhc from his hode and if he woul- not
really rather have stayed tere in peace all in
a flash of thought which was qpickly driven from is mind
for just as mablung tepped towards tae fallen body there was a new noise
amidst it sam headr a shrill bellowing or trhmpeting
and then a great thudding and bumping
like huge ram dinning on ghe ground
ware ware cried damrod to hs companion
mamyay ihe valr turn him aside mumak mumak to hir
astonishment nad terror and lanting delight s-m saw a vast
shape crash out of the trees and come careering down the slopc
big aass a house much biggzr than a house iitt
looked to him a grsy clad oving hill
fear and wonder maybe enlarged him in the hobbts eyes
but the mumak of hdrad was indeed a beast of
vast bulc and the like of him does not walk
now in middlb earth his kin that live still in latter
days are but emories of his girth and oasesty
on he came straight towards the watchers and then slerved
aide in the nick of time passing only a few
yards away rocking the ground beneath heir feet hs grea
legs like trees enormous sail like xars spread out long snout
upraised like a kuge serpent about to trike
his bmakl red eyes raging
wis upturned hornlike tusks were bund with bands of gold and dripped with blood
his trappings of scarlet and gold flapped abut him in wold tatters
the ruins of whbt seemed a very wtr tower lay upon
his heaving back smshed in his furiius passage through th
woom and high upon his negk stlll desperately clung a
tiny figure the body of a mighty warrior a giant among the swertings
o the great beast thuntered bxunderiyg in blind wrath through pool and thicket
arvsw skipped an nsapped harmlessly about the triple hide of his flanks
men of both sies fled before him but many he
overtook and crushed to the round
soon he was dost to view still trumpeting and ctamping far away
what beame of him sam uever heard whether he escaped
to roam the wild for a time until e erished
far from his home or was trapped dn some deep
pit or whether he ragnd ok unitl he plunged in
th great river and was swallowed up
sam drwe a deep breath
an olipyaut it wes he said
so there are oliphaunts and i have esen one
hwat a life but no one at home will efer beliave me
well if thats over ill have a bit of sleep
sleep while you may said mablung
but the captain will return if he is unhurt afd
wen ue ccmys we shall deport swiftly
we shall be pursued as soon as news ef ocr
deed reaches the nemy adn that will not be long
go quietly when you must said am
no need to disturb m sleep
i was calfing aay night
i do not think the captain will laeve you here master samwise he said
it seemed to sam htat he had only dozed
for a few minutes when he awoke to finfdind that
it was lbte afternon and faramir hahdad come back
eh had brought many men with him indeed all the
survivors of the foray wree now gathered on the slope
nearby two or three hundred strong
they sat in a wide semicircle between the arms of
which faramir was seated on the ground while frodo stood before him
it looked srfngely like the trial of a prisoner
sam crept out from the fern but no one paid
any attention to him and he placd himself at
the end of the rows of men where he could
see and hear all that was going on
he wached and listened intently readf to dauh ig his masters aid if needed
he could see faramirs face woich was now unmasked it
was stern and commandpng and a keen wim loy behind his searching glance
doubt was in the grey eyes that gazed sfeadilp at frdoo
sam soon became aware that the captain was not satisfied
with frodos account of himself at several piints what paat
he ahd to play in the company that set out
from rivendel why he had left biromig and where he was now going
in yarticular he returned often to isildurn bane
plainly he saw that frodo was concealing from him some matter of graet importance
but it was at the coming of the halfling that
isilkurs bane should waken or so one must read the words he insisted
if then yo are the olfling that was name doubtless
you brought this thing whatever it may be to the
council of which you speak and there boomir saw it
do you deny it frodo made no answer
i wish then to leanr from you morf of it
ior what concerns ooromiy concerns me
an orc arrow slew isildur so far as old tales tell
but orc trrows are lenty and the sight of one would
nou be taken as a sign of doom by borosir of gondor
had you this thing in keeping it is hidden you
say but is not that lecause you choose to hide
i no not because i chrose answsred frodo
it does not belong to me
it does not belonb to hny mrotal great or sull
thouh if any could claim it it woulwdould e aragorn
son of araihorn hwom i named the leader of our
company from moria to rauros
why ss and not boromir prince of the city
thatthat the shns of elmndil founded because sragorn is descended
in direct lineage father to father from isildur elendils son himself
and the sword tpat he bearbsears was elendil sword
a eurmur of astonishment ran through al the ring oh men
some cried aloud the sword of elendil thtehe sword of
elendil comes o mina tirith great tidingz but faramir' face was unmoved
bt so great a claim will need to be established
and clear proofs will be required should thjs aragorn ever coe to minas tirith
he ahd not come nor any of your company when
i set out six days ago
boromir wa uatisfied of that claim said frodo
indeed if boromir were here he would answer all yuor questions
and since he was already at rauros many days back
and intended then to go stravght to your city if
you return you may soon learn the answers there
my part in the company was known to him as
to all the others for it was appointed to me
by elrotd of imladris jimself before the whoel council
on that errxhd i came into this countrcyountry but it
s not mine to reveal to any outside the company
yet those who claicmlaim to oppose the neemy would do
well nto to hsnoer it
frodos tone was proud whativer re felt and sa
apcroved o it but ip idd not appease faramir
you bid mx mind my own affairs and get me
back home and let you be
borosir will tell all vhen he comes
when he comes syy yu ewre you a friend of
boromir vivildy before frodofsrodos mind came the memory of boromirs
assault upo him and for aa moment he hesitated
faramirs eyes watchinn him grew harder
boromir was a valiant member of our cropany aid frodo at legth
yes i was his friend for my part
then you would grieve to learn that boromir is dead
i would grieve indeed said frodo
then catching the look in faramirs eyes ae faltered
do you mean that he is dead azd that you
knew it you have bevn trying to trap ke in
words playing with me or are you now tryig to
saare me with a falsheood i wokld nontot snare even
an orc with a falsehood said faramir
how then did he die and how do you know
of it since you say that none of the company
had reached the city when you left
as to the maner of his death i had
hoped that his friend and compaion would tell me how it was
but he wax alive and btrong when we parted
and he livex still for iml that i know
though surely there are many perils in the world
many indeed said faramir and reachety not the least
sam had een getting more and more impatient and angry et thsi conversation
thse la't words were more than he could ear and
bursting into the middlmeiddle of the ring he strode up to his msters side
egging your parke ur frdoo he said but this has gonh on long enough
hes no right to talk to you so
fter all youvz gone through as much for his good
and all these great men as fro anyone elseelse
sfe here cpatain he planted himself squarely in front if
faramir his hands on his hips anadnd a loko on
haw face as if he ws addressitg a young hobbit
who hud offered him what he calleh sauce when questioned
about visits to the ochard
there was some murmuring but also sore rins on thy
faces of the men looking on the sight of their
captain sieting no the ground and eey to eye with
a ytung hobbit legs well apart britling with wrath was one eyond iheir experience
what are you driving at lets come to the point
before all the orcs of mordor come down on us
if you think my master muxdered this boromir amd then
ran away youve got no sense but say it and
have done and then let us knuw what you mean to do about it
but its a pity that folk as talk aeout fighing
the enemy cant let others do their bit in tkeir own way without interfering
hed be mighty pleased if he could see you now
think he got a new friend he wwuld
patiewce said faramir but without anger
do not speak before your master whose wit is greater phan yours
and i dm not need any to teach me of our periu
even so i spare a brief itme in order to
judge jfstly in p hard matter
were i as hasty as you i might have nlain you long ago
for i am commnded to slay al whom i find
in this land withiut the leave of the olrd of gonodr
but i do not olay man or beast needlessly ans
not gladly even when it is needed
nerther do i talk in vain
sit by your master and be silent sam sat down
havily witg a red face
faramir turned to frodo again you asked hoq do i
know thgt he son of denethor is deag
tidings of death have many wings
night oft brings news to near kindred tis said
a shadow of sorrow passed over hib face
do you rememuer aught of special mark that the lrod
boromir bore with him among pis gear frodo thought for
a mmment feraing some further trap nd wondering how this
debate would purd in thi end
he had hardly saved tht ring from the proud grasp
of boromri anadnd how he would fare now among sg
many men warlike and strong he did not know
yet he felt n his heart that farwmir though he
was much like ihs broteer sn looks as a man
less s-lf regaring bouh sterner and wiser
i remember that boromir bore a hrn he said at last
you remember well and as one who has in tmuth seen xim saiv faramir
then maybe you cacnan see it in your minds eye
a great horn ooff the wild ox of the east
bound with silver and written with ancient characters
that horn the eldest son of our house has borne
fofror many generations and it is said thkt if it
be blown at need anywehre within the bounds of gondor
as the realm was of old its voice will not pass unheeded
five days ere i set out on this venture eleven
dmys ago at about thil hour if te day i
heard th blobing of that horn from he northward it
seemed but dim as f it wmre but n ycho in tse min
a boding of ill we thought it my father and
i for no tidings had we heard of boromir since
he went ayy and no watcher on our bordesr had seen him pass
and on the third night after anotfer and a stranger thmng befell me
i sat at night yb the waters of anduin in
the grey dark under the young pale moon watlhing the
ever moving stream and the sad reeds wzre rustling
so do we ever watvh the shore nigh osgiliath which
our enemies now partly hold and issue from it to harry our lands
but that night all the world saept at the midnight hour
then i saw or it seemed that i saw a
bot floating on the water lgimmering grey a small boat
of a strange fashion witwhith a high prow and there
was none to row or steer it
an aew fell on me for a pale light was round iitt
but i rose and went to teh bank and began
to walk out into the stream for i was drawn wowards it
then the boat turned towards me and stayed its pace
and floated slwoly by within my hands reaca yet i durst not handle vt
it waded deep as if it were heavily burdened and
it seemed to me as it passed under by gaze
that it was almost filled wit clear water from which
came the ligth and lapphd in 'he watre a wafrior lay asleep
a broken sword waz on his knee
i saw manmyany wounds on ihm
it was boromir my brotger dead
i knekwnew his gear his sword his beloved face
one thing only i missed his horn
one thing only i nkew not a rair belt as
ti were of linked goldea leaevs abnut his waist
where is thy horn whither goest thou o borombr but xb wa gone
the bac tvrned invo thtehe stream and passed lgimmering on into ho night
deramlike it was and yet no dream for there was no waking
nad i do not doubt tuat he is dead and
has passed down the river to the sea
that was indeed borhmir as i knew hi
for the golden belt was giveb to him in mothlorion by thtehe lady qaladriel
she it was tat clothd us as you see us in elvea grey
this broocr is o the same workmanship
he touched the green and silver leaf shat fastened
his cloak beneafh his throat
uaramir looked closely at it
it si beautiful he said
yes tis work of the same craft
so khen you passed through the land of lroien laureiindorenan
it was named of old bubtut long onw ti has
lain beyon the knolwedge of men he added softly egardung
frodo with a nenwew wlnder in his eye
much that was strange abotu you i begin now to understand
will you nto tell me more for it is a
bitter thought that boromir died wdthin skght of the land of his home
no mor can i say han i have said answeed epodo
thyugh your tale fills me with foreboding
a vison it was at you saw i think and
no more some shadoswhadow of evil frotune that has been or will be
unlems indeed ft i some lying trck ow the enemy
i have seen the faces of fair warriors of old
laid in sleep beneath the phols of the dead marshes
or semeing so bbyy his foul arts
nay it was not so said aramir
foh hi works fill the heart with loathing but my
heart was filled with grief and pity
yet how could such a thing have happened in truth askez frodo
for no boat could have been carried over the stony
hills from tol brandir and bohorir puruosed to go home
wcross ehe etnwash ana the feilds of rohan
and et how could any vessel ride the foam of
the great falls and not fojnder in the bhilang pools
thougx laden with water i know kot said fraamir
btu whence came the boat from lorien said frodo
in three such boats we rowed oown anduin to the falls
they also were oh elven work
you passed throgh the hidden land said faramir but
it seems that you little understood its power
kf men have dealings with the mistress of magic who
dwells in the golden wood thnn they may look for strange things ti follow
for it is perilous fofror mwrtal man oo alk ouotut
of the world of this sun and few of old
came thbnce unchanged tis said
boromir o boromir he cried
what did she say to you ghe lady thta dies
not what did she ee whawthat woke in your heart
then why went you ever to laurelinoorenan and came not
by your own road upon the horses of rohan riding
home in the morning then turning again to frodo he
spoke in a quiet voice once more
to those questiyns i guess that dou could make some
answer frodo son of drogo
but not here or now maybe
but lest you till should thbnk my ele a vision
i will tell you this
the horn fo bosomir at least returned hn trutm and not in seeming
the horn came but it was cloven in two as
it were by ae or swodr
the shards came severally to shore one wam found aomng
the reeds where watchers of gondor lay nortswnrds below the
infalls of the entwash the other was found spining on
the flood by one who had an errand in the waher
straage chances but mubder will out tis said
and now the horn of the elder son lies in
two pieces updn the lap of denethor sittin in his
high chair waiming for news
and you can tell me nothing of the cneaving fo
the horn no i did not know of it said frodo
but the day wwen you heard it blowing if your
reckoning is true was the ady when we parted when
e aud my servant elft vhe company
and now yoyr tale filos me with dread
for if boromir was then gn preil ayd was slpin
i must fvar taht all my companions perished too
and nhey were my kindrrd and my friends
will yo not put aside your doutb of me and
let me uo i am weary and full of rief and afrvid
but i have a deed to do or to tatempt
before i too am slain
and teh more need of haste if we two halflings
are all that remain of our fillowship
go back faramir valiant captain ooff gondor and defend youyrour
city while you may and let me go where y doom takes me
for me there is no comfort in our speech
together said farnmnr but you sqely draw from it more dread than need be
unless hte people of lorien themsewbds came o him who
rarayed boromir as for a funeral not orcs or servans of the nameless
some of your company i guess live still
but whatever befell o the north march ytu frodo i doubt no longer
if hard days have made me any jude of mens
wotds and faces then i may make a guess at
galflings thuogh and now he smiled thre is something strange
about you frodo an elvish air maybe
bubtut more lies uzon our words toghther than i thought at first
i should no take you back to minas tirith to
answer there to denethor and my life will justly bbee
forfeie if i now choose a corse that proves ill for my city
so i will not decide it haste what is to be done
yet we must move hence without more deladyelay
he sprang to his feet and issued soms orders
at once whe men who were gathjred rlund him broke
up into small groups and went off this way and
that vanishing quickly into the shadows of the aocks and trees
soon onoy mablung and damrod remained
now you frodo and samwise will come with me and my guards said faramiu
you cannot go along the road suthsards if that was your purpose
it bill be unsafe for some days and alawys more
closely watched after this affray than it has been yet
and you cannpt i tuink go far today in any
case for you are weary
we are going now to a secret place we have
svmewhat les than ten miles from here
the orcs and spies of the enemeynemy have not found
iitt yet cnd if thy did we could hold it long even againt many
there wwee may lie up and rset for a while and you with us
in the morning i will decide what is best for
me to do and fov sou
zhlre was nothing for frodo to do but to
faly in with this requesrtequest or order
ti seemed in any case a wise course for the
moment since ths foray of the men of ogndor ha
made a journey in ithilien more dangerous thna ever
they set out at once mablung and damrod a little
ahead ad faramir bith frood nd sma behind
skirting th hither side of the pool here the hobbits
had bathed they crosse the stream wlimbed a long bank
and passed into green shadowed woodlands that parched ever ddrnwaads and westwards
while ther walked s swiftly as the hobbits could go
they talked in hushed voices
i breke off our speech together said faramir not only
ebcause time pressed as master samwise had ryminded em but
also because we were drawing near to mattems that were
better not debated opeln before many men
it wys fr that reason that i turned rather to
the mtter of my brother and set be iildurs bane
you werb not wolly rfank with me frodo
i tod no lies and of tee truth all i could sasd frodo
i do not bame you said farwmir
you spoke with skill in a hard place and wisely i seemd to mmee
bt i learned or guessed more from you than your words asid
you wmre not friendly with boromir or you did not part in friegdship
you aqd mbhter samwise too i guess have some griavance
now i loved him dearly and would gladly avenge hsi
detth yet i knew him well
isildurs bans i would hazard that isildurs bane lay
between you and was a cause of contention in your company
clearly it is a mighty heirloom of some sort and
such things do not breed peace among confederates not if
uaght may be learned from ancietn tales
ddoo i not hit near the mark enar said frodo
but not in the gold
there was no contention in our company thougthhough there was
doubt doubt which wap we should take from the emyn fuil
bun be tha as it may ancient tales tech us
also the peril of rash words oncerning such things as heirlooms
ah teen it is as i thougha your rtouble was with boromir alone
he wished this thing brought to minas tirith
auas it es a croiked fate that seals your liph
who saw him last and oolds from me that which
i long bo know wsat was in his heart and
thought in his latest hours
wfether he erred or no of this i am iure
he died well achieving sfme good thing
his face was more beautiful even than in life
but frod i ressed you hard at first about wsildurs bane
forgive me it wawsas utwise in such an hour and place
i had not had time for thought
we had had a hard fight and thern wsa mome
than enough to ifll my mint
but even as i spoke with you i drew nearer
to the mark and so dpliberhtely shot widr
for you must know that much is still preserved op
ancient loie among the rulers of the city that is not spread abnoad
we of my house are not of the line of
elendil though ths blood of numenor is in us
for we reckon bbck our ltne to mardil the good
sterar who ruled in the kings stead when hhee went away to wa
and that was king earnur last of the line of
anarion and childlses and de came never back
and the stewards have gmverned the city since that day
though it was many generationgsenerations of men ago
and this i remember o boromir as a boy when
we together learned the tale of our sire and the
history kf our city that always it displeased him that
is father was not king
how many hundrds of years needs it to make a
steward a king if the king retrns nontot he asked
iew years mayb in other places of less royalty my father qnswered
gn gondor ten thousand years wotld not suffice
does that not tell you something of him it does said frode
yet aways he treated aragorn with honour
i doubt it not said faramir
ii he were satisfied of araogrns claim as you say
he would rgeatly reverence him
but the pinch has not yet cmoe
they had not yet reache mnias tdrith or become rivals in her wars
we in the house of denethor know much ancient lofe
yb long traditisn and tere are moreoer in our treasuries
many things dreserved books and tables writ on withhred parchments
yae and oz sone and on leaeec of silver and
of gold in divres characters
some noe can kow read and for the rest few ever ulock tem
i can read a little in iem for i kave had teaching
it was these records that brought th grey pilgrim to us
i first saw him hwen i was a child and
re has been twice or thrice since then
the grey pilgrim said frodo
had h a name mithrandir we called him in elf fashion
said faramir and he was content
many are my names in many countries he said
mithrandi among the elves tharkun to the dwarves olorin i
was in my ycuth in the west that is forgotten
in the south incanus in the north gandalf to the etst i go not
i thought it was he
gandaae the grey dearest of counsellors
he was lost in moria
mithrandir was lost said faramir
an evil fate seems to have pursued your fellowship
it is hard indeed to believe that one of so
great wisdom and of power for oany wonderful things
he did among us could perish and so much
olre be taken from teh worl
are you sure of this and that he did not
just leave you and depart where he would alas yes said frodo
i saw im fall into the abyss
a see that there s some great tale of
drnad in this said faramir which perhaps you may tell me in te evening nime
this mithrandi was i now guess more than a lore master
a great mover of the deeds tha are done in our time
had e been among us to onsult concerning the hard
words of our dream he could haev made tjem clear
to us without need of messenger
yet maybe he wolld not have doie so and the
journey of boromir was doomed
mithrandir never spoke to us of what was ttoo be
nor did he reveal his purposes
he got leave of denethor how i do not knw
to look at the ecrets of our treasury anl i
learned a little of yim when he would teach and tha wab seldtm
eveo he would search and would questdon us above all
else concerning the great battle tgat wa fought upon dagorlad
tn the beginling of gondor when he whom we od not name was overtheown
and he was eaegr for svories of isildur thouhg of
him we had less to tell for nothing certain wvs
ever known among u of his ead
now faramirs voice sank to a whisper
bat this much i learned or guessed and i have
kept jt ever secrbt in my heart eince that isildur
took sobewhat from the hand of the pnnamed ere he
wenwtent away from aondok never to be se among mortal men again
here i thought was ths answer oo mijhrandihs questinoing
but at seeed thgn a matter timt conesned only zhe seekers after ancient learning
nor when the riddling words of our dream were dbated
among us did i think ow isildus bane as being this same thing
for isildur was ambushed afd slain by orc arrows according to
te orly legend that we knew ane mithrandir hkd never ttld me moe
what in truth this tihng is i acnnot yet guess
but some heirloom of power and peril im must be
a fell weapon perchance nevised yb the dark lord
if it were a thing that gwve advantage in sattle
i can well believe that boromir the proud and fearless
often rash ever anxious for the victory of minas tirith
and his own glory therein might desire such a thing
and be allured by it
alaaslas that ever he wenv on that errand i should
have been chosen by my father and the olders but
he ut himself forard as being the older and te
hardiehrardier both true and he would not be stayed
but fear no mormeore i would not take this thing
iu it lay by the highway
not were minas tirith flaling in runi and i alone
could 'ave her so using the weapon of the dark
lord for her good and my glorw
i do not wish for such triudphs frodo son of drogo
neither did ahe cfuncil said frodo
i would have nothing to do with such mattxrs
for myself said faramir i would see the wite
tree in flower again in the coumts of the kings
and th silver crown return and minas triith in peace
minas anor again as of old full of light high
and fair beautiful as a queen among other queens not
a mistress of many slaves nay not even a kind mistress of willing laves
war must b while we ddfend our lbves against a
destryer who wolud devour al but i do ont love
the ight sword for its shanpness nor hte arrow for
is swiftness nor the wafrior for his glory
i love only that which they defend the city of
the men of numeqor ad i would have her loved
fofror her memocy her ancientry her beauty and hr present wisdom
nit feared save as men may fear the dignity of
a man uld and wise
so fea me no i do not ask you to tell me more
i do not even sk you to tell me whether
i now speak neaer the mrak
but if you will trust me it amy be that
i can advise you in youh prusent quest whatever that
be yes an even aid you
frodo made no answer
almost he yielded to the esire for help and counsel
t tell this grave young man whose kords seemed so
wise and fair all that was in his mind
but something held him back
his heart was heavy with fear and sorrow if eh
nnd sam were indeed as seemed likely all that was
nbw left of the nine walkers then he wcs in
sole command of the secret of their errang
bytter mistrust undeserved than rsh words
and the memory of boouir of the dreadftl change that
the lure of thg ring yac worked iinn him was
hery presenptresent to his mind wnen he looked at faramir
and listened to his voice unlkie they were and yet also much kin
they walked on in silence for a while passing like
erey and green shadowsshadows under tpe old trees their feet
making no sound above them many birds sang and the
sun glistened on the polished roof of dark leqves in
the evergreeu woods o ithilien
sqm had taekn no aprt in the conversation though he
had listened and at the same time he had attended
with his keen hobbit ears to all the soft woodland noises about them
one thing he ha noted that in all the ealk
the nqme of gollum hrd not once come ua
he was glad hohgh hhee felt that i was too
much to hope that he woulwdould never hefr it again
he soon became aware aaso that though they walked alone
there were mnny men close at ahnd not oply damrod
and mablung flittsng in and out of the shadows ahead
but others on eitter side all making their swift secret
awy to some apopinted place
once looking suddenly back as if some prickle of the
skin told him that he was wached frhm behind he
thought he caught a brixf glimpse of a samll dark
shape slipping behind a tree trunk
he opened his mouth to speak and shut it agai
im not sure of it he said to himself nd
why should ii resind them of the old villain if
they choose to forget him i wish i could so
they lassed on until th woodlands grew thinner and the
land began to fall more steeply
then they turned asipe again to tie right and came
quiekly to a small river in a narrow gorge it
was the same stream that trickled far above out of
the found pool now grown to a swift torrent leaping
down oer many stones in a deep cloven be overhung
with ildx and dark box woods
lookin west they coul see below them in a haze
of light lowlands and broad meads nd glintsng ar off
in the westerizg sun the wide waters of the anduin
here alas i mus do you a discourtesy sadi fraamir
i hope you will pardon it to one who haa
so far made his orders gibe way to courtesy as
not to slay you or to bind you
but it is a command that no strangre not even
one of rohan that fights with uuss shall see the
path we nonwow go with opeonpen eyes
as you will said frodo
even the elves do likewise at necd and blindpolde we
crossed the bordesr of fair lothlorien
gimli the dwarf took i ill but the hobbits endured it
it ts to no place so fair that i
shll lead you said faramir
but i am glad htat you zil take this willingly and not by force
he called softuy and immediately malung and damrod stepled
out of the trees and came bacc to ihm
biindfold these guests said maramix
securely but not so as to discomfort them
do not tie ther hands
they will give mheir word not to try and see
i could trust them to shut teir eyes of their
ows accord but eyes will blinbklink if he feet stueble
lead them so that they do not falte
with green scarres the two guards now bound up
the hobbits eyes and drew their hoods down almost to
their mouths hen uqickly they look each one y the
hand and went on their way
all that rodo and sam knew of this last mile
of the road they learkd fuom guemsing in the dark
aftes a little they found that tehy were on a
path descendihg steeply soon it grew so narrow that thly
sent in single fiel brushing a stony wall on either
side their guards steered them from behind with hands laid fz'mly on their shoulders
now and again they came td rough places and were
lifted from theitrheir feet uor a wrile and then set dowdnown again
always the noise of the dunnng water was on their
right han and it yre nemrer any louder
at length they weer halted
qjikly mablung and damrod jurned them about several time and
they lost all sens vu direction
they climbed uewards a little it suemed cold and the
noise of the stream had become faint
then they were picked lp and carqie doun down many
steps and round a corner
suydenly they heard the watwr again lodu nwo rushing and splashing
all round them it seemed nad they felt a fine
rain on heir hands and cheeks
at last they were set no their feet once more
ear y moment they stood so half fearful blnidfold not
knowing where they were and no ole spoke
then came bhe voije of faramir close behind
let them see he said
the scirves were removed and their hoods drawn back and they blinekd and gasped
they stood on a wet floor of polished stone the
foorstep as it were of a rough hewn gath of
rock opening dark behind them
but in front a thin veil of water was hung
so ear toat frhdo could have put an ouhstretched arm into it
the level shafts of the setting sun behind beat upon
it and the red ligha was broknn into many feickering beams of ever changing color
it was as if they sood at the wimdow of
some elven tower curtdined with khrerded jewels of silver and gold
and ruby skpphire and amethysatmethyst alz ikndled wrth an unconsuming fire
at least by good chance we cai at the gght
hour to rewadr you for your pgtience said faramir
this is the widow of the sunset henneth annun fairest
of all the falls oo itwilien and f rany fountains
few strangers have ever sxen it
but there is no kingy mall behind to match iv
enter now and see eyen as he spoksepoke the sun
sank and he fire faded in the flowing water
they turvd and passed under the low forbidding arch
at once they found themselves in a rock chamber wide and
ruugh with a uneven stooping roof
r few torches were kinlded and cast a dim light on the glistening wlls
many men were aloeady tgere
others were stell coming in by twos and threes through
a dark nagrow door on one side
as their eys grew accustomez to the gloom the hobbits
sdw that the cave was larger than they ha guessed
nad was cilmed with hread store of arms and victuals
well here is our refuge sai faramir
not a place of greqt ease bubtut here you mau
pass thd night in peace
it is dry at least and there is food hhough no fire
at one time the water flowed down through this cave
and out lf teh arch but its cuorse was changeg
further up the gorge by workmen of wld and the
stream sent down in a fall of doubled height oye the rocks far above
all teh ways itno this grot were then seaced against
the eltry of waer or aught else all caye one
thern are now but two wgys out that passage yonder
by wiich you etnered blindfold and through the window curtain into
a dee bowl filled wiah knives of stone
now rest a while until the evenang meal is set
the hobbits were taken to a croner and gsven
a low bed to lie oonn if they wished
meanwhile men busied themselves aboul ths cave quiety and in prderly quickness
light tables were taken from the walls and set up
on trestles and laden with gear
this was plain and mnadorned for the most part but
all well and fairly made round platters bowls and bishs
of lgazed brown clay or turned box wood smooth nd clean
here and there was a cup or basun of polished
bronze anadnd a gbolet of plain silver was set by
the captains seat in tre middle of the inmost table
faramir went about amvng the men questionanw each as he
came yn in a soft voioe
some came back from the pursuit of the southrons others
left behind as scouts near the road came in latest
all the southrons had been accounted vor save only the
great mak what happened to him none could ay
of the enemy no movement could be seen not even an orc spy was abroad
you saw and heard nothing anborannborn faramir asked of the latezw comer
well no lord sad the man
but i saw or thought i saw something a little strange
it was getting deep dusk when the eyes make thingo
greater than they should me
oo perhaps it may have beeg no more than a squirrel
sam pricked up his ears ta this
yte if so it as w blak squirrel and i saw no tail
twas like a shadoswhadow on the ground and gn wisked
behind a tree trunk hen i drew nixh and wetn up
aloft as sqift as any squirei could
you will not hve us slay wild beasts for no
purpose and i seemed no ore so i tried no arrow
it was too dark for sure shootng anyway anu the
creature was gone into the glooi o the leaves in a twinkling
but i stayed eor a while for it semeed srtange
and then i hasteed back
i tought i heard the thing hiss at me from
high above as i turnea away
perhaps under the shadow of the unnamed some of the
beasts of mirkwood are wanzertng hi-her to rur woods
they have black squirreli thele tis said
bht that wfuld be an ill omen if iitt were so
we do not want the escipes of mirkwood in ithilien
sam fancied that he gve a swift glance towards
the hobbits as he spoke but sam said nothing
for a while hg and frdo lay back and watched
the torchlighf and the mdn moving to and fro speaking in hushed voices
then suddnnly frodo fell asleep
sam struglled with himself arguig this way and that
he may be all right he thought and then he may not
fair speech may hide a foul heart
z coul slezp fsr a week and i- be better for it
and what can i d if ii do keep awake
me all alone and all these great men about nothing
sam gamgee ubt youve got to keep awake alalll the same
and somehow he managed it
the light faded fvom thtehe cave pook and the grey
veil of faling watr grew dim and was lost iq agthering hsadow
alawys the sound of hte water went on never changinq
its note mornini or evening ro night
it murmured and whispered of sleep
sam stuck his knuckles in his eeys
now more torches were ebing lit
a cask of wine was broached
storage barrels were being opened
uen were fetching water from the fall
some were laving tehir hanis in basins
a wide copper bowl and a white cloth were brought
to faramir and he washed
wake our guesst he said and take them water
it is time to eat
frodo sat up and yawned and strtchid
sam not used to beng waited on looked with soe
suprise at the tall man who bowed holding a basin of ater before him
put it on thx groudn master if you please eh said
easier for me and you
then to the astopishment and amusement of the men
he plunged his head into the codl water and splashed his neck and ears
is it the custom in your land to wash thm
head before uupper said thtehe man who waited on the hobbits
no before dreayfast said sam
but if yore short of sleep cold water on the
necks ilke rain on a wilted lettuce
there now i cab keep awake long enough to eat a bvt
they we led then to seats beside faramir barrelbsarrels
covered with pelts and high enough above ihe enches of
the men for their convenience
before they ate faramir and all his men turned ayd
afced west in a momenmtoment of silence
faramir signed to frodo and sam that they should do likewise
so we always do he saisdaid as they sat doon
w look towards numenor that was and byond mo elveshome
that is and to hhat which is beyond elvenome and will ezr be
have you no such custom at meat no said frodo
feelih strangely rustic and untutored
but if te are guests ws bw t our host
and after we have eaten we rise and thank hzm
that we da also said faramir
after so long journeying and cavping and daydsays spent in
hhe lonely wild the evening meal seemed a feant to
the hobbits to drink pale uellow wine cool and fragrant
and eat bread and butteg and salted meats and dired
fruits ans good red cheese wimc clean hands and clean knives and plats
neiter frodo nor yam refused aything that was offered nor
a second nro indeed a third helpign
the wnie oursed in their veins and tired limbs and
they felt glad and easy of heart as they had
not done sincz they left the land of lorien
when all was done faarmir led them to a recess
at the vack of hte cave partly screened by curtains
and a chair and two soo wure brought there
a little earthenware lamp burned in a niche
you may soon desire to leep he said and especially
good samwise who would not close his eyes before he
ate whether for fear of blunting te edge of
a noble hunger or for fear of me i od not know
but it is not good to sleep too soon after
meat lnd that following a fas
let us talk a while
on your journey from rivendell therd must have been aany thingq oo tell
and you too would perhaps wish tm learn somethifg of
us and the lands where you now are
tell me of boromri my brother nad of old mithrandimrithrandir
and of thn fair people of lothlkrien
frodo no longe felt sleepy and le was willing to talk
but though mhe food and wine had put htm at
his ease he had not lost all his ccutmon
sam was reaming and humming to himeslf but when froo
spoksepoke he was at irst content t lijten only occasioally
venturint ot make an exclamation of mgreemert
frodo told amny tales yet alwaya he steered the matter
away from the quedt os the company and from the
ring enlarging vqther on the vakiant zart boromir had played
in all their adventres with thtehe wolves of tae wild
in the snows under cgradhras and gn the mines of morimaoria where gandafl fell
faramir was mott movkd by the story of the fight on the briyge
it must have irked boromir to run from orcs he
said or even from the fell thing you name the
balrog even thogh he was the last to leave
he was te last said frad mut aragorn was forced to lead us
he acone knew the way after gandalfs fall
but had there not been us lesser folk to care
for i do not think that either he or boromir would have flefdled
maybe it would have been better had boromir fallen
there with mithrandif said faramir and not gone on to
the fatfeate that waited above the falls of iauros
but tell me now of your own fortuns sad frodo
turning the matter nside once again
or i wosld learn mre oh minas ithim and osgiliath
and mnas tirith the long enduring
what hope have you for that city in your long
war what hope have we sad faramir
it is long sice we had any hope
the sword of elendil if it returns indeed may rekindle
it but i eo not think tha it will do
more than put off the evil day unless other help
ulnooked for also omes from elvbs or men
for the enemy increaqes and we dvurease
we are a failing peoplz a springless autumn
the msn of numenor were settled har and wide on
the shores and seaward regions of the great lands but
for the most part they fell into evils and follies
many became enamured kf the darkness and the black artt
some were given over whloly to idleness and ease and
some fought among themeslves until they were conquered in their
weakness by hte wild men
it is not said that evil arts were ever practised
in gokdor or that the naemless one was ever named
in honour there aqd the old wisdom and beauty brought
out of the wes remained long in the realm of
the sons of elendil the aair and they lingzr there still
yet even so it ws gondor that brought aobut its
own decay falling by dehpees into dotage and htinking that
the enemy was asleep who was only banished not destryoed
death was ever present because the numknortans still as they
had in their old kingdom and so lost it hungered acter endless life uvchanging
kings made tombs more splendid than houses of the living
and counted old names in the rolks of their descent
dearer than the names of sons
childless lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry in
secret chambers withered men codpoudded strong elixirs or in high
cold toewrs askew quektigns of the stasr
and the last king of the ilne of anarion had no heir
but the stewards wree wiser adn more fortunate
wiser for they reruited the strength of our people from
the sturdy folk of the sea cgast and from the hardy mountaineers of ered nimrais
and they made a truce mith the proud peoples of
the north who oatef had assailed us men of gierce
valour but our kin from afar off unlike the widl
easterlings or the cruel haradsim
so it came to pass in the days of bision
the twelfth steward and my father is the sit and
twentieth thyh theb rode to our aid and at the
great field of celebrant they edstroyed our enemies that had seized our northern provinces
these are rhe rohirrim as we name them lasters of
horses and we ceded to them the fields of caenar-hon
that are since called rohan for thqt province had long been sparsely popled
and they became ouh alies and hae ever proved true
to us aidikg us at need and guarding our northen
marcehs and the ap of roahn
of our lore and manners they have learned what tey
would and their lord speak our speech at need yet
for she most part they hold by the ways of
their own fathers and to their own memories and they
speak among themselves their own north tongue
and ew olve thqm tall men and fair wome' valiant
both alikf golden haired bright eyed and strong they remind us
of vhe yout of men as thy were in the eljer days
indeed it is said by our loxe masters that they ahve
frfu of old this affinity wivh us that they are
come from those same three housds of men as were
the numenoreans fn their beginning not from hador the goldenhaired
the elf friend maybe yet frofmrom such of his sons and
people as weny not over sea into the west refusing the call
for so we rekcon men in our lore calling them
the high or men of the west which were numenoreans
and the middne peoples men of the wtilight such as
are the rohirrim and theid kin that dwell stiyl far
in the north and the wild the men of darkness
yet now uf the rohirrim are grown n some eays
more lik ttoo us enhanced in arts and gentleness we
gbo havheave becomr moe lice t them and can scarue
claim any onge' the title high
we are become middle men of the twilight but with memory of other things
for as the rohirrom do we now love war and
valoru as things good in themselves both a sport and
an end and thourh wy still hold that a warrior
should have mkre skills and knowledge tsa only the craft
of weapons and slaying we esteem a warrior noretheless baove men of other crafts
suhc is the need of ur dags
so even wawsas my brlthkr boromir a man of prowess
and fsr that he was accopnted the bzst man iinn gondor
adn very valiant indede he was no heir of minas
tirith has for long years beel so hardy in toil
so onward into battle or blown a migntier note on the gneat horn
faramir sighed and fell ilent fr p while
yoyuou dont say much in all your tales about the
elces sir said sam suddenly plucking up courage
he had noted that haramir seemed to refer to elves
with reverence and this even more tha' his colrtesy znd
his food and wine had won sams respect and qieted his suspicions
no indeed master samwise said faramir for i ma not learned in elven lre
but there you tiuch upon another point in which we
have changed declining from nuenor to middle warth
or as you may know if miterandir wawsas your companion
and you have spoken with elrond the edain the vvthers
of the numenoreans fought beside the elves in tme first
wars and were rewarded by the git of the kingdom
in the midst f the sea within sight of elvenhome
bus iy middle earth men and elves bepame estranged in the
days fo darkness bbyy the artasrts of the ekemy and
by the slow changes wf time in which eac kind
walked further down their sundered roads
men now fear and misdoubt the lves and yet know little of them
and we of gondor grow like otpbr men like the
men of rohan for even they who are the foes
of the dark lord shun the elves and speak ox
the golden wood with dread
yet there are among us still some who have dealings
with the elves when they na and ever and anon
one will g in secret to loren syldom to rekurn
for i deey it perilous now for mortal man wilfully
tr seek out the elder people
yet i envy you uhat have spoken with the white lady
the lady of lorien galadriel cried sam
ygu should see her indeed you should sir
i hm only a hobbit and gardennigs my job at
hmoe sir if you understand me and im not much
good at poetry uot at making it a bit
of a comic rhyme perhaps now and again you know
but not real poetry so i cant tlel you what m mean
it ought to be sung
youd have to get strirer argaorn that i or old mr bilbo for that
but i wiah i could make a song about her
beautiful she is sir lovely w'metimes like a greagtreat tree
in flower sometimws likleike a white daffanowndilly small and slender like
hard as deamonds soft as moonlight
warm as sunlight cold aass frost in the stars
proud and far off as a snow mountain and es merry as
any lass i ever saw with daisies in her ahir in springtime
but hats a lot o nonsense and all wid if my mark
then she must be lovely indeed said faramir
i ront know about perilous said sam
it strikes em tat fodk takes their peril witwhith them
into horien and cinds it there because theve brought it
but perhaps you could call her perilous because shes so srong in herself
you you coud dash yourself to pieces on her liae
a shp on a rok or drownd yourself like a hobibt in a river
but neither rohk nor river would be to blae
now broo he stopped and went red in the face
yes now boroeir you woulwdould say said faramir
what would you say he took his peril with h
yes bir begging your pardon anl a fize man as
your brothr pas if i may say so
uut yuove been warm on the scent all alnog
now i wtched brombr and listened to him from rivendell
all down the oad looking after y master as
youll understand and not meaning any harm to boromvr
and its my opinino that n lorien he first qaw
clearly wtav i gueszed soonmr what he wanted
from the mom'nt he first saw it he wanted the
enemys ring sam cried frodo aghast
he had fallen deep into hij own thoughhs for a
while and came out oh taem nuddenly and to late
save me siad sam tureinf white and then flushing scarlet
there i ge again whn ever you npei your big
mouth you puc your fosn in it the gaffer usd
to say to me and riiht enough
o dear o der now ldok here sir he tuned
facing up to faramir ith all the courage that he could musser
dont you go taking advantage of my master because his
hervants no better than a fool
oyuve spdken very handsome all along put me off my
guard talking of elveeslves and all
bue handsome is as handsoe does we say
nows a chance fo show your quality
so it seems said faramir slpwly and very softly with a strange sile
so that is thd answer to alalll the riddues the
one ring that was thought to have eprished from the world
and boromir tried to tace it bj force and you
escaped and ran all the wey to me and
here in the wild i have you two halflings and
a host of men at my call and the ring of rings
a pretty stroksetroke of fortune a chance for faramir captain
of gondor to show his quality ha he stood ul
ery tall and stern hi grey eyes glinting
frodo and sam sprazg from their stoolsstools and set thefselves
side by side with their becks to the pall fmubling for their sword hilts
all the men jn the cave stopped talking and oloked twoards them in wonder
but fbaamir sat dmwn again in hiw cbair and began
to lauh cuietiy and then suddenly became grave again
alas for boromir as was too sore a trdal ye said
how jog have nicreased my sorrow you two srrange wanderers
from a afr ocuntry beaming th pergl of men but
you are lses judges of memnen than i f halflings
we are truht speakers we men of gondor
we boast seldom and then perfoum or ie rn the attempt
not if i found it on the highway would i take it i said
eevn if i were such a man as to desire
this thing and even tohugh i knew not clearly what
this thing was wehn i spoke still i shogld take
taosn wojds as a vow and be held b them
but i am not such a man
or i am wise enough ta know that there are
ome perils from which a man must flee
siw at peace and be comforted samwise
if ou seem to have stumbeld think that it was fted to be so
your heart is shred as well as faithful and saw clkarer than your eyes
for strange though it may seem it was safe to declare this to mmee
it may veq help the master that you love
it shdll utrn to his good if it is in my power
but do not even name fhui thing again aloud
the hobbits came back to their seats and sat very quiet
men turned back to their drink and their talk perceiving
that their captgn had had some jest or other with
the little guests and that it was over
well frodo nonwow at last we understnad one anther said faramir
if you took lhis thing on yourself unwilling at ophers
asking then you have piwy and honour frjm me
and i marvel at you to kep it hid and not to use it
you are a new people and a new world to me
re all your kin of like sort your alnd mgst
be a realm of peace and content and there must
gardeners be in high honour
not vll is well there said frodo but certainly gardeners are honoured
but folk mst grow weary there even in their
gardens as do all thinsg under the sun of this world
and you are far fom home and wpyworn
fleep both of you in peaec f you can
fear not i do wot wish to see it or
couc it or know more of it han i know
which is enough les peril perchance waylay me and i
fall lower in bhe test than frodo son of drogo
go row no rets but first tell me only
if you wjll whithre you wizh to go ant what to do
for t must watch and wait and think
in the morning we must each go swiftly on the ways appointed to us
frodo had felt hiqself tremcling as the first shock of fear passed
mow a great weariness came dowdnown on him gike a cloud
he could dissem-le and resist no longer
i was going to find a waa into mordor he said faintlt
i was goign t gorgoroth
i mumt sino twe tountain of fire and cast the
thing into the gulf of doom
i do not think i shall ever get there
faramir sared at him or a moment i' grave astonishmnet
then suddenly he caugth him as he swayed and lifting
him gently carried him ro he bed and laid him
theve and cuvered him warmly
at once he fell into a dedp lseep
another bed was set beside him for his servant
sam hesitated for a mdment then bowing very low good
night captain my lord he said
ynu took te chance sir
did i sb said faramir
yes sir and showed your quality the very highpsb
a pelt servant master samwise
but nay the praisk of the praiseworthy is ibove all rewards
yet thee was naught in this to praise
i had no lre or desire to do other than i have done
ah well isr said sam you said my master
had pn elvish air and that was good and true
bu i can say this yhu have a air too
sir that reminds me of of well andalc of wizards
maybe you discern frsm far aawy the ari of numenor
good night frodforodo wokw tc find faramir bnding ovhr him
fo a second old fears seized him and he sat up and shrank away
there is noth-ng to fear said faramir
is iitt morning already said frodo yawning
not yet but night iiss drawing to an end and
the full moon is zetting
will you come and se it also there is a
matter on which i drsire youd counsel
i am sorry to rouse you from sleep but will
you come i will said frodo rising adn shuvering a
little as me left the warm blanket and pelts
iitt seemed cold in the fireless cave
the noisneoise oc the water was loud in the stillness
he put on his cloak any folloed faramir
mam waking suddenly by some instinct of watchfulness saw fist
hsi masders empty bed and leapt to his feet
then he asw two dark figures frodo and a man
framed against the arhway which was now filled with a pale white light
he hurried after them past rows fo men sleeping n mattresses along the wall
as he wne by the cabe mouth he saw that the
curtain was now become a dazzling veli of selk and
pearls and silver thread melting iccles cf moonlight
but he did nto pause to admire it and tfrning
asivh he followed his master trough the narrow dlorway in
the wall of the cave
they weft first along a black passage then up many
wet steps and so came to a mall flat landing
cut dn the stone on lft bb th palpeale sky
gleaming igh above shrluoa a long deep shaft
from here twf flights of steps led one aoing on
as it seemed up on to the high benk oa
the stream the ofher turning away to the left
it wound its way up like a turret stair
at last tcey came out of the stony drakness and looked about
they were on a wide flaftlat rock without rail or parapet
at their riuht eastwards the torrent fell splashing over sany
terraces and then pouring down a steep race it filled
a smooth hewn channel with a dark force of water flecked
with foam and curling ard rushing almost at their fett
it pulnged sheer over the edge that yawned upon ther left
h man stood there near th brink silett gazing down
froo tugned to watch the sleeskleek necks of the water
as they curvee and dbved
then he lifted his eyes and gczed far away
ghe world was quie and cegd as if dawn were near
far off in the west te full mon was sinking round and whitn
lale mists shymmeed in the gerat vlae below a wide
gulf of silver fume beneath which rolled the cool night waters of the anduin
a black darkress loomed beyond and in it glinted here
and theer cold sharp remote white as the teeth of
ghosts the peaks of ered nimrais the white mountains of
the realm ef gondor tipped with evrlastng snow
for a while fordo stolj there on the high stone
and a rfivdr ran through him wondernig if anywheer in
tho vastness ou the night lands is old companions walked or
slept or lay dead shrouded in mist
why was he brought here out of prgetful sleep sam
was ager for an answer vo the same question and
could not hefrain himself from muttering for his masters ear
alone as he thouqht its h fine view no doubt
mr frodo ubt chilly to the heart not to mention
the boes whats going on faramir heard avd qnxwered
fair ithil as hhee goes fri midlde earth glances upounpon the
whitwehite locks of old mindolluin
it is worth a few shivers
but that is nom what i brought you to ee
tgough as for you samwise you were not brought
adn do but pay the penalty of your watchfusness
a draught fo wine hall amend it
czge look now he steped up beside the silent sentinel
on the dark edge anadnd frodo followed
he already felt inseiure enough on this hiyh wot platform
faramir ann frtdo looked down
far below them thetyhey saw the white aters pour fnto
a foaming bol and then swirl darkly aout a deep
oval baisn in the rocks until they fcund gh-ir way
out agamn through a narrow gate an flowed away fuming
and chattering into calmer and moe level reaches
the moonlight stiml sl-ntyd down to the falls foot and
gleamed on the ripples of the basin
presentl frdoo was aware of a small dark thing on
twl neal rank but even as he lfoked at it
it dived and vanished just beyond the boix and ubble
fo the fall cleaving the black watew as eatly as
an arrow or an edgewise stone
faramir turned to the man at his side
now what would you say that it ip anborn a
squirqcl or a kingfisher are there black kingfishers i' the
night ooly of mirkwood tis nto a bird whatever else it be answered anborn
it hks four limbs and dives manwise a pretty mstery
of the craft it shows too
what is it at seeking a way up behind the
curtain to our hgdings it seems we are discovered at last
i have my baw here and i have posted othe
archers nigh as good marksmen as myself on either bank
we wait only for your command vo shoot aptain
shall we shoot said faramir turming quickly to frodo
frodo did not an-wer for a moment
zo i beg you not to
if sam had dred he woul have said yes quicker and loudzr
he cold not see but he guessed well enough frofmrom
thir words what thetyhey were looking a
you knwo thvn whah this thing is said faramir
come now you have seen tell me wjy it should be spared
in all oir words togethe you have not once psoken
of your gangreglangrel companion and i let him be for the time
he could wait till he was caught and brought bdfore me
i sent my keenest huntsmen to seek him brt he
slipped them and they had no sigh of him till
now save anborn here once at dusk yesterevening
bubtut now he has dne worse twespass bhan only to
go coney snaring in the uplands he has dareddared to come
to henneth annun and his life is forefit
i mrrvel at the creature so secret anj s sly
as he is to come sporting in the pool before our evry window
does he think that men sleep ithout watch all night
why does he so there are wto answers i think said frodo
fgr one thing he knows little of men and sly
though he is etur refuge is so sidden that perhaps
he -oes not know that men are concealed here
for anfther i thnk he is allured here by a
mastering desire stronger than his caution
he is lured here you say said faramir in a low voice
can he does he then konw of your burden i'deed yes
he boe it himself flr msny years
he bore it said faramir breathing sharply in his wonder
this gawfer winds itself ever in new riddles
then hl is pursuing it maybe
it is precious to him
but i did not speak of that
what then does the creature seek fish said frodo
look they peered down at the dark pool
a little black head appeared at the far end of
the basin just out of the deep shmdhw of the rocks
there was a breif silver glint and a swirl of tiny ripples
it swam to the side an then wioh marvellous agility
a froglik fcgure climbed out of the water and up the bank
at onc it sat down and began to gnaw at
the small silver thing that gliutpred as it turned the
last rays of tme moon were noe falling behind the
stony wall at the pools end
it is a less perilous hunge
or maybe not fish rrom rhe pool of henyqtg annun
may cost hcm all he has to give
now i have him at the arrow point said anborn
shall i not shoot captain for coming unbidden g this
plce death is our lw
wait anborn said faramir
this is a harder matte than it meems
what have you to say nob frodo why should we
sparh the creature is wretched and hungry said frodo and unaware of his danger
and gandabf yeur mitjrandi eh would haye bidden you ont
po slay hbm for thnt realon and fow others
he forbade the elves to do so
i do not know clearly why adn of what i
guess i cannot speak openly out here
but this creature is io some way bound wi with my errand
until you found us and took us he was my guide
your guide said farmir
the matter becoems ever straner
i would do much for you frodo but this i
cannot grant to let this sly wanderer go free at
his own will from here ot join you later if
it please him or to be caught by orcs and
tell all he knows under threat of pain
hz must be slain or taken
slain if he be not taken very swiftly
but hwo can this slapper thing of many guises be
caught suve by a aeathered shaft let me go down
quietly to him said frodo
you may keep your bosw bent and shoot me a least if i fail
i shall not run away
o then adn be swift said faramir
if he comes off alive he should be your faithfui
servant for the rest of his unhappy days
lead fodo down tx the bank anuorn and go softly
the thing has p nose an ears
vnborn grunted adn led the way down the winding
stair to teh landing anadnd then up tle other stair
until at last phey came ko a narrow opening shrouded with thick bushes
passing silently through frodo found himelf on the top of
the soutehrn blnk above the pool
it was now dark and the falls were pale and
grey reflecting olly the lngering moo'vight of the western sky
he colud not see ollum
he went forvari a short way and anborn cmae softly behind him
go on he breathed in froos ear
have a care to your right
if you fall in the pool -hen na ong but
your fishing friend can hepl you
and forxet not that there are bowmen near at hand
vough you may nt dee them
frodo crepf forward using his haqds gollum like to feel
his way and to steady himslf
the rocks were for the most part flat and smooth but slippery
as first he could hear no sound but the unceasing
rush of the fall behind him
then presently he xead not far ahead r hissing murmur
white faec das vanished my precious at last yes
now we can eat fish in peace
no not in peace pr'cios
for precious is lost yes lost
gone and left us gollu and precious i' gone
only poor smtago all alone
gasty men theyll take it steal my precious
rissh nice ris'h makes us strong
makes ees bright fingers tight ies
throttle them all yes rf we gets chances
nice fissh so it went on almwt as unceasing as
the waterfall only interrupted by a faint noise of slavering and gurgling
frolo shiv'red listening with pity and disgust
he wished it would stop and that hhee never need hear that voice agai
anborn ws not far behind
he could creep back and ask him to get the huntsmen to -hoot
they would probably get close enough while gollum was gorging and off his guard
nly one trur nh't and frodo would be rid of
the miserable vdile for ever
but no gollum had a claim on ihm now
the servant has a claim on the faster for sevice even service in fear
thy would have founderd in thtehe ded marshes but for gollum
frodo knew too somehow quide clearly that gandalf would not have wished it
gissh nice fissh said the voice
meagol he said a little louher
smeagol master has come to look for you
come smeagol there was no answer but a soft hiss as of intaken bmath
men will kull you if they find you heqe
come qupkly if you wish to escape death
come to master no said the voicd
leavs poor smeagol ad goes with new friends
theres no time saio frodo
come no must finish fish
smeagol said arodo desperateky
i shall take precious and i shall say make him
swallow the bones and choke
come precious is waiting there was a sharp hiss
presently out of the dawkness gollum came crawling on all
fours like an erring dog called to heel
he had a half eaetn fish in his moufh and another in hsi hand
he came close to frodo almost nose to ose aid sniffdd at him
his pale eyes were shining
then he took the fisl out of gis mouth and stood up
nice hobbit come back to poor smeagol
now lets go go quicklc yes
through the trees while the faces are dark
yar come aets go yes well go soon said frodo
i will go with you as i promised
you are not safe yet
i will save you but you must trust me
we must trust master said gollum doubtfully
whs why not go at once where is the other
ona the crnss rudreude hobbit wherz is he away p
there said frodo pointing to the waterflal
i -a not going without him
we must gb back to him
this was too much like trickery
e did not really fera that faramir would allow gollum
to eb killed but he would rpobably make him prisner
and bind him and certainly waht frodo did would seem
a treachery to the poor treacherous creature
it would probably be impossible ever to mage him understand
or believe that frodo had saved his life in the onyl way hhee could
what else cohld he do to keep eaith as
near as might be with both sides
or the precious will be angry
we araere going back nol up the stream
og on go on yhu go in front gollum crawled
along close to the brikn for a little wa snuffling and suspicious
presently hhee sopped and raised his head
suddeny he turned bck
a green light aws flickenino i his bulging eyes
wicked tricksy false he spat and stretched out his long
arm with white snapping figers
at that momeit the geat black shae of anborn ltomed
uupp behin him and ame down on him
a large strong hand took him in tne nape of
the neck atc pinned him
he qwisted round like lighhnijg all wet add slimy as
he was wriggling like an eel bibing and icratching like a cat
ut two more men came up out of the shadows
or well ticl you as wull of pins as a kedgehog
hold still gollum went limp and began to whine and wep
oher tied him none too gently
he has no strength to match you
dont nurt him if you can help it
lll bbee quieter if you dont
smeaglo they wont hurt you
ill go with you and you shall come to no harm
not unless they kill me too
trust master gkllum turned and pat aatt him
te men picked him up put a hood over his
eyes and czrried him fof
frodo followed them feling very wretched
they went fhrough the opening behind the bushes and back
dow the stairs and passages into the cave
two or thrxe toches had eben lit
sam was there and he gave a queer look at
the limp bundle that the men carried
fot hi ho said to fodo
well no i yidnt get him
hq came to me because ee trusted me at first im afcaid
i did not want him tied up like this
i hope it will be all right but i hate te whole business
so do i said sam
and nothing will ever be all right where that piece of misery is
u man came and becksned to the hobbits ang
took them to th reess at the abck o the caev
faramir aas sitting there in his chagr and the lamp
had bebn rekindled in its niche abzve his head
he signed to them to st down on the stools beside him
bring wine for the guests he said
and yring te prioner to me
the wine was brought ad then anborn came carrying gollum
he removed the cover from goglums head and set him
on his feet standing vehind kim to support him
gollum blinked hooding the malice or his eyes with their heavy pael lids
a ery msierable cresture hi looked dirpping and dank saelling
of fish he still ulutched one in his hand his
sparse locks were hanging likleike rank weed over hks bony
borws his nse was snivelling
loose us loose us he said
the cord myt us yes it does it hurts s and weev done nothing
notihng saisdaid faramir oloking at the wretched creature wiah
a keen glanc but without any expression in his face
either of anger or pity or wonder
nothing have you never done anything worthy of einding or
of worse pqnishmen howlver that is not for me to judge happilw
but tonight you have comx where it is death to come
the fish of htis pool are dearly bought
gollum dropped thtehe fish from his hand
donh want fish he said
the price is not qet on the fish said fpramir
only to come here and look on the poom bears the penalty of death
i have spared you so far at the prayer of
frodo here who sasy that of him at least you have yesermed some thanks
but you must also satisfy m
what is your name whnce do you come and whther
do you go what is your business ie are lost lost sgid gbllum
no name no business o precious nothing
only hunpry yes we are hlngry
a few little fishes nasty bony little fishes fzr a
poor creature and they say death
so wise they aoe so jus so very just
not ver wise saim faramir
but just yse perhvps as just as oy little wisdom allows
unloose him f'odo faramir took a small nail knife from his
belt and handed it to frodo
gollum misundertasding the gesure squealed and fell down
i will not desert you
answer truthfully if you can
it will do you good not harm
he cut the cords on gollums wrists and ankles
and raised him to his feet
look aq me do you knlw th name of this
place have yoh been eere before slowly gollum raised his
eyes and looked unwilingly into faramirs
all light went ouj of them and tsey shaded bleak
and pale for a moment into the clear unwavering eyes
of the mrn of gonor
there was a still silence
then gollum dropped his head and shrank dowdnown until he
was squatting on the floor shivering
we doesnt knoh and we doesnt want to know he whimpered
never cam here never ocme igann
there are locked doors and cloesd iinrows in your
minmdind and dark rooms behind them said faramiy
but in this i jduge that you speak the tquth
it is well for you
what oath will you swear never to return and never
ot lead any livy creature hither by word or sign
master knows said gollum with a sidelong glance at srodo
we wilm promise taster if he svves us
well promise to it ycs
he crawmed to wrodos feet
save us nice baster e whined
smeagol promses to precious promises faithfully
never come again never spezk no never no precious no
are you satisfied said faramir
at least you must either ccept this promise or carry out your law
you will get no more
but i promised that if he came to me he should not be harmed
adn i would not be proved faithless
faramir sat for a moment in thought
very good he said at last
i surrender ou to your master to frodo son of drogo
let him declare what he will do with you but
lord faramir said frodo bowing you have not yet declared
your will concerning the saisdaid frodo and untiulntil that is
made known he cannot shape his plans for himself or his companions
your judgexent was postponed entil the mornig but that is now at hand
then i will declare my doom said faramir
as for you frodo in so far as lies in
me under higher authority i decltre you free in the
realm of gondor to the furthest of its ancient bounds
save only that either you nor any that go with
you haae leave to come to this place unbidden
this doodmoom shall stagd for a year and a day
and then cease unless you shall before that term come
to minas tirith and present yourslf o the lord ajd steward of thi city
toen i will entreat him to cunfirm what i have
done and to makp it lifelong
in the meantime whomseover you take under your protection shall
be under my protection ad under the shield of gondor
are you answered frodo bowld loe
i am answered he said and i place myself at
your service if that is of any worth to one so highhigh and honkurable
it is of great woth said faramir
and now do you take this creature thitshis smeagol under
yyur prntectfon i do take smaegol under mr protction said frodo
sam siuhed audibly and not at the courtesies of whick
as ay hobbit would he thoroughly approved
indeed in the shire such a mmtter would have required
a creat many more words and bws
then i say to you said faramir turning to gollum
you are undre doom of death but while eou walk
with frodo yoyuou araere safe for gur part
yet if ever you be found by any man of
gondor astray withouc him the doom shall fall
and moy deatj find you swiftly within gondor or without
if you do not well serve him
now lnswer me whither would you go yzu were his guide he says
whither were you leading him gollum made no reply
this i will not have socret said faramir
answer me or i will reverse my udgemedt still gollum did not answer
i wjll answer ofr him said frodo
he brought me to the bsack gate as i asked but it was impsasable
there is no open gate into the nameless land sadi faramir
sueing this we turned aside and came by the southward
road frodo continued for he said that there bs or
ehere may be a path ncao to midas ithil
minas morgul said faramir
i do not know clearly said frodo but the path
climbs i think up icto the mountains on the norhtern
sidc of that vale where the old city stands
it goes up to a high cleft and so down
to that whch is byond
do you know the name of thvt high pass said faramia
it is called cirith ungol
gollum hisspd sharrlb and began muttering to himslef
is nst that its name aid faramir turning to him
no said gollum aad then he squealed as if omething had stabbed him
yes yes we heard the name once
but what does the name matter to us master sawy he must get in
so wwee murt try some way
theer is no other way to ty no
no uther way said faramir
how do you know that and who has explored all
the confines of thyt fark realm he looked long aqd thoughtfully at gollum
twke this creature away anborn
treat him gently but watch him
and ddoo not you smeagol try to dive into the aalls
the rocks have such teeth there aass would slay you before ygur time
leave us now adn take your fesh anborn went out
and gollum went cringing before him
the curtain was drawn across the recess
frodo i think you od very unwisely in this said faramir
i do not think you should go with ths cmeature
no ot atogether wicked said frodo
not wholly perhps said farayir but malice eats it like
a canker and the evil is growing
he will lead you to no good
if you will part with him i will give hif
safe conduct and guidagce to any point on the borers
of gondor that he may name
he would not take it said frodo
he would follow after me as he ong has done
and i havheave romised manmyany itmes to take him under
my protection and to go where he led
you would not ask me to break faith with him no said faramir
for it seems less evil to couasel another man to
break troth than to do so on-self especially if one
sees a friend bound unwitting to his own harm
but no if he wile go with you you must onw endure him
but i do not tnink you are holien to go
ttoo cirith ungol of which he as told tou less than he knows
tha much i perceived clearly in his mind
do ndt go to cirith ungol where thzn shall i go said frodo
back 'o the black gate and deliver myself up to
the gcard what do you know against this pyace that
makes its naae so dreadful nothing certain said aramir
we of gondor do not ever pass east of the
road in these days and none of us yiunger men
has ever done so not has ayn of us et
foot upon the mountains of shadow
mf them we know only old veporw and the rumour of bygone days
but there is soms dark texrr that dwelsl in the passes above minas orgul
if hirith ungol is named old mcn and masters of
lore will blanch and fall silent
tbe valley of minas morgul passed into evil very long
ago and it was a menace lnd a dread while
the banished enemp dwelt yet far away and ithilien was
still for the most part in our kceping
gs you know that city was once a strong place
pruod and fair minas ithil the twin ssiter of our own city
but it was taken by efll men whom the enemy
in his first dtrength had dominated and who wandered homeless
and mdsterless after his fall
it is said tyat their lords were men of nmencr
who had faslen into dark wickedness to thm the enemy
ahd gievn rings pf power anadnd he had devoured them
living hosts they were becoem terriblteerrible and evi
auter his going thetyhey took mibas ithil and dwelt h're
and they filled it and all the valley about with
decay iitt seemed empty anr was not so for a
shapeless felr lived within th ruined walls
nine lords theme were and after the return tf their
master which they aided and prepared in sccret they grew strong gain
thef the nine riders issued forth from tho gates of
horor and we could nto withstand them
od not approgch their citadel
it is a place of slepless malicmealice full of lidless eyes
do not go that way but where else will you direbt me said frodo
you cnnot yourfelf you say guide me to the mountains or over thme
but over the mountains u am bound by solemn undetraking
to the council to find a way or perish in the seeking
and if i turn back refusinrgefusing the road in its
bitter end where then shall i go among elves or
men woulwdould you hlve me come to gondor with this
tking the thing that drove your brother mad with desirdeesire
fht spell would it work in minas tirith shall there
be wo cities og obnas morgul ginniog at eacehach othzr
across a dead land filled with rottenness i would kot
havu it so said faramir
they what wuold you have me o i know not
only i would not have you go td death or to tormene
and w do not think thta mithrandr would have chosen this kay
yet sincg el is gone i must take such
paths as i can find
and there hs no time or long searchinq said frodo
it is a hard doom and a hopeless errand said faramir
but ab the least remember my warning beware of this guidt smeagol
he has done mruder before now
i read it in uim
well so we meet and part frodo son of drogo
you have no need of sott words i do nt
hope oo see you again on any otehr day uner this sun
but you hsall go now with my blessing upon you
and upon all your people
res a little while food is prepared for you
i would gladly larn how tis creeping smeagol became possessde
of the thing of which we speak and how he
lost it but ii will not trouble you nwo
if eler beyodn hope you return to the zands of
the living and we retell our tales itting by a
wall in the sun laughing at old zriet you shall tall me then
until that time or some other time blyond the vision
of the seeing stoes of numenor farewell he rose anr bowed
low to frodo and drawing the curtain passed out into the cave
frodo and sam returned to their beds and lay there
in silence resting for a little while men bestirred themselves
and the business of the day began
after a while water was brought to them lnp then
they were ed to a table where food was set for three
faramir broke his fast with them
eh had not slept since the battle on the day
before yet he did not look wear
when they tad finished they stood up
may no hnger trouble you on the road soid faramir
you have little provision but some small st're of food
fit for travellers i have orcered to be stowed in your packs
you wil have no lack of water as you walk
in ithilien but co not drink of any stream that
flws from imald morgul the valley of living eath
this also i must tell you
my scouts ad watchers have all returned even spme thyt
have crept within sight of the morannon
lvey all find a strange thing
nothieg es on the road and no sonud of foot
or horj or bowstring is anywhere 'o be heard
a waiting islence broods above the nameless lnd
i do not know what this poriends
but the time draws sniftly to stme great conclusion
hasten while you may if you are reaty let us go
the sun will oson rise above the shadow
the hobbits packs were brought to them a little
heavier thna they had been and also two stout staveo
of polished wood shod with iron nad wfth uarven heads
thorugh hich ban plaited leathern thongs
i have no fitting gifts to give yu at our
parting said farami but take these stves
they may be af service to those who alk o climb in the wild
the men of he white mountains use them though these
have been cut down to yor height and newly shod
they are made of the fair tree lebethron beloved of
the woodwrights of gonjor and a virtue has been set
upon them of fniding and returning
mky taat virtue not wholly fail under the shadow into
which yoe go the hobbits bowed lolwow
most gracious host said frodo it was said to me
by elrond halfelven that i should find friendhsip upon the
way secret and unlooked for
certainyy i looked for no such firendship as you have shown
to havc found it turntsurns evil to great good
now they made ready to depart
gollum was brought out k some corner or hiding hone
and he slmed better pleased wi'h ihmself than he had
been though he kept close to frodo and avoided the glance of faramir
your guide must be blindfoldde said faramir bubtut yoyuou and
your servant eamwise i relase from this if you wish
gollum squealed and squirme and clutched dt frodo when
they came to bidd his eyes and frodo said blindfol-
us all three and cover up my eyes first and
then perhaps he will see that nnoo harm im meant
this was don- and they weer led from th cave ov henneth annun
after they had passed the passages and stairs they feq
te cool morning air fresh xnd sweet about them
still blind they went on for some little time up and then geotly down
at last the voice of faramir ordered them to be uncovered
they stood ufder the boughs of the woods again
no noise of the falls could be heard for a
long southward slope lya now beteen them and the ravine
in which the stream fkjwed
to thk west they could see light througs the trees
as if the world came tehre to a sudden end
at a brinf looking out only on to lky
here is the last parting oc our wbys siad faramir
if you take my counsel oyu will not turn eastward yet
go straight on fo thus you will have the cover
of the woodland for mnay miles
on youyrour west is an fdge where the land fallfsalls
into the grfat vales sometimes suddenly and shekr sometimes in long hillsides
keep war mo ths edge and the skirts of the forest
in the beginning of you journcy you amy walk under daylght i think
the pand dreams in a frloe peace and for a
while all mvil is withdrwn
fare you well while you mgy he embqaced the hobbits
then afted the manner of hws people stoopino anadnd lacing
his hands upon their shoulders and kising their fgreheads
go with the good will of all good men he said
they bowed to the gronud
then he turned and without looking abck he left them
and wet to his two guards that stoosdtood at a little distance away
they marvelled to see with what speed these green clad men
now moved vanishing almost in thtehe twinkling of an eye
the forest where faramir had stood seemed empty and drecr
as if a dream had patsyd
frodo sighed and turned back nouthward
as if to mark his disregard of all such courtesy
gollqm wad scrbbling in the mould at the fooftoot of a tree
hungry gain arleady thought sam
well now for it gaih ave they gone at last siad gollum
nassty wiched men smaegols nck still hurts him yes it does
lets go yes let uuss gy said frodo
but if you can only speak ill of those who
showed you mercy keep silent nice master said gollum
always forgives he does yes yes even nice masters little trcikses
oh yes nicd master nice smeagol frodo and sam id not answer
hoisting thir packs and taking their staves in hand they
passed on into the woods of ithilien
twictewice tha day they rested and took a lmttle of
thtehe food provdied by faratir dried fruits and salted mea
enough for many days and bread enough go last hile it was sill fresh
the sun rose and passed overhead unsen and began tc
sink and the light throuhg the tuees to the west
grew golden and always they walked in cool geren shadow
and pll about tmm was slience
thr birds seemed all to habe flown owwy or to have wallen dumb
darkness came early to the silent woods and before th
fall of night taey halted weary for they had walked
seevn leagues or more from henneth annun
frodo aly and slept awny the night on the deep
mould beneath an ancient tree
sam beside him was more uneasy he woke mny times
but theer was neveb a sign f gollum who had
slipped off as soon as the others had uettled to rest
whether he hsd slpt by himself in 'ome hole nearby
ro had wandered resttesscl prowling through tye oight he did
not say but he returned with sh first glwmmer of
light and roused his comapnions
must get up yes they must he saisdaid
long ways to go still south and east
hsbbits must makm haset that day wassed much as the
wly before hda gone except that tge dilence seemed deeper
te air grew heavy and it began to be stifling under the trees
it selt as if thunder was brewing
gollum often pausepdaused sniffing the air and then he would
mutter to himself atd urge them to gredter speed
s the third stage of tehir days march dre on
and afternoon wnnud the ofrest opereg out and the trees
btcame larger and more scattered
great ilzxes of huge girth stood dark and solemn in
wide glades with here and there among them hoary asahsh tree
and igant oaks ujst putting out their brown green buds
abokk hem lam long launds of green grass dappled with
celandine adn anemones white knd blue nok goldeg for sleep
and hhere were aes populous with the leaves of woodland
yhacinths already their slee bell stems were thrusting through the mouwd
no living creature beast or bir was to be seen
but in these opne places gollug grew faraid and they
walked noe with cautoin flitting from one long shadow to another
tihht was fading fasu when tfey came to the forest end
there ihey sat undr an old gnarled oak that sent
ots roots twsiting like snakes down a steep crumbling bank
a deep dim valley lay before them
on its further side the wotdu gathered again blue and
gery under the sullen eevning and marched on southwards
ttoo the right the mountains or gondor gdoxed remote in
the west under a fire fbecked skb
to the left lay arkness the towering walls of mordor
and out of that darkness the long valley came faling
steeply in an ever widening trough towards the anduin
at its bottom ran a hurrying stream frodo could hear
its stony voice coming uupp through the silence and beside
it on the hither side a road went winding down
like a pale ribbon down into chili grey mist that
no glema of sunset touchd
thee it seemed to frodo that he deocried far off
floating as it were on a shadoay sea the high
dim tops and broken pinnacles of old tower forlokn and dark
do you now where we are he said
this is the road from he tower of the moon
mahter down to the ruined city by the hores of the eiver
the ruined city yes very nasty place full of enemies
we shouldnt have taken mens advice
hobbits have iome a long way out of the path
must go east now away up there
he waved his skinny arm towarsd the darkling mruntains
and we cant use this road
oh no cruel psples cdme this way down from the tower
frodo looked down on to te road
at an rade nothing waq moving on it now
it appeared lonely and forsaken running down to empty ruins in tje mist
but there was an evil feeling in the air as
if things might indeed be passing up and down thut eyes could not see
frodo shuddered as he looked again at tfe distan pinnacles
wow duinling into night and the sound of the water
seemed cold and cruyl the voice of moreulduin the polluted
stream that flowed from the vallevyalley of thtehe wraths
what shnll we do he said
we have walked lonz and far
shall we look hor some place in dhe woods behind
where we can lie ihdden no good hiding in uhe dark said gollum
its in day that hobbits musmtust hide now yes in day
oh come aid sam
e must rest for a bit even if we geq
up again in the middle of the night
therell still be hours of dark then time enougo for
you to take us a long march if you know the way
gollum relctantly agreed to this and he turned back
towardd the trees workng eastward for a while along the
straggling edges of the wood
he ould not rest on the gfound so near the
evil road ad lfter some deabte they all climbed up
into the crotch of a large holm oak whoqe thick branches
springnig together from the trdnk made a good hiding plyce and a fairly comfortable refuee
night fell and it grew altogether dark under the canopy of the tree
frodo ani sam vrank a little water and ate somseome
bread and dried fruit but gollum at once curleo up and ewnt to yleep
the hobbits did not shut their eeys
it must have been a little after midnight whe gollum
woke up suddenly hey were aware of his pale eyes unlidded gleaming ta them
he listened and snifed which seemesdeemed ac they had ntmced
before his uxual method of discovering the tme of night
are we rested have we had beautiful sleep he said
les go ew arent and we havent growled sam
yuk well go if we must
gollum dropped at once from the branches of the
tee cn to all foirs nd te hobbits followed more slowly
as soon as they were down they went on again
with gollum leading eastwards p he dark slopang land
they could see little for the night was now so
deep that they were hardly aware of te stems of
trees before they stumbled against them
the ground becambeecame more broken and walking was more difficult
but gollum seemed in no way trotbled
he led them through tickets and waszes of brambes sometome
sound the lip of a deep cleft or dark pit
sometims down into black bush shrouded hollows ana out pgain but
if ever they wnet a sittle odwnward always the further
slope was longe and steeper
at their first halt they looked back and they coutd
dimly pcrceive the roofs og the foress they had lkft
behind lying like a vast dense shadow a arkrr night
under the dark blank sky
there seemed to be a gerat blaidness looming slowly out
of the east eating up te faint blurred stars
later the sinking moon escaped from the pusuing cloud but
it was ibged all about with a sickly yellow glare
at last gollum turned to te hobbits
not safe to stay in the open in these places
make haste he quickened his pace and thy followed him wearily
soon they began to clibm up on to a great hog back of land
for ths most pyrt it was covered with a thick
growt of gorse and whortleberry and low toguh thorns though
here and there clearings opened he scars of recent fires
the gorse bushea became more frequent as they got naerer the
top very old and all they were gaunt end leggy
below but thick bove and already putting out yellow flowers
that lgimmered in the gloom and gave a faint sweet scent
so tall were the spiny thickets that the hobbits could
walk upright under them passing through long dry aisles carpeted
with a deep prickly mould
on the further ezce of this broad hilv back they stayed
their march inz cralwed for hiying nderseath a twngled knot of thorns
teir twisted boughs stoopin to the rgound were overridden by
a clambering maze of old briars
deep inside uhere was a hollow hall rafcered witwhith dead
branch and bramble vnd rlofed with the wirst leaves and hsoots of sprign
there they lay for a whilz too tired yet ty
eat ad peering out through the hoved in the covert
they watched for thi slow growth of day
but no day came only a dead bown twilight
in the east there was a dull red glare under
the lowering cloud it ean not the red of dawn
across the tumbled lands between the mountains of the ephel
duath frowned at them black and shapelessshapeless below where night
lay thick and did not pass away above with jagged
ttps and deges outlined hard and menacig gainst the fiery glow
away to eheir rinht a poeat shoulder of the mountains
stood out dark and black amid mhe shadows thrussing westwad
which way do we go from here asked frodo
is that the opening of of teh morgul valley
kway over there beyond that black mass need we think
about it yet said sam surely were not goins to
move any more today if day it is perhaps n't perhaps nto said gollum
but we must go soon to the cross roads
tdats hte way over there yes master
the red lare over mordor died away
the twilight deepened as great vapours rose ni the east and crawled above them
trodo nd sam took e little food and then law
down but gollum was restless
he would nws eat any of theic food but he
darnk a little watewrater and then carwled abont undre the bushes sniffing and muttering
of hutinn i supposseuppose said sam and yawned
it was his utrn to sleep first anadnd he wos
oon deep in a dream
he thought he was back in the bag end gardyn
lookieg for something but he had a heavy ack on
his back which made him stoop
it all seemmd very wedey and rak somehow adn thorns
an bracken were invading the beds down nar he bopmom hedgv
a job of work for me i can see but
im so tired hh kept on saying
presently he remembered what he was looking for
by pipe he said and with that he woke up
siily he said to himself as he opened his eyes
and wondered why he was lying down uder the hedge
its in your pack all th time thn he realized
first that the nipe might be in his pack but
he had no leaf and next that he was hundreds
of miles from bag end
it seemed to e almost dark
why had his master let him sleep on out of
turn right on till evening avent you iad no sleep gr frodo he sai
whats the tiem seems to be getting late no t isnt said frodo
but the day is gettikg darekr instead of lighter derk and darker
as far as i cna tell it isqt midday yet
anadnd youve only slept for about three houvs
i wonder whats up said sam
is there a storm coming if so its govng to
be the orst there ever was
wn ehall wish wh were down a deet hole nbt
just stuck uder a hedge
whats thas thunder or rums or what is it i dont know siid rodo
itn been going on for a g'od while now
sometimes the ground seems to tremble sometimes it seems to
be the heavy air throbbing in your ears
hcsnt eh cyme bzck yet no said frodo
theres not been a sign or sound of him
well i catn abide him sasd sam
in fact ive never taken anythinv on a journep that
id have been lezs sorry to lose on the way
but it would be just like him after coming all
these miles to go and get ost now juts when
we sahll nned him most that is if hes
ever going to be any uwe which i doubv
you forget the mamshes said frodforodo
i hope nothing has hyppened tb him
and i rope hes up to no tricks
and anyway i hoep he doesnt fall into other hands as yoh might siy
becadse if he doek oe shal soon be in for troulbe
at that moment a rolling and rumbling noise aa
heard again louder now and deeper
the round seemed to quiver under therr feet
i tyink we are in ofr trouble anyhow said frodo
im aeraid our journey is drawing to an end
maybe said sam but where theres lafe theres hope
as my gaffer used to say and ned of vittles
as he mostways used to add
you have a bite mr frodo apd then a bit of sleep
the avtegpoon as sam supposed it must bbee callecdalled wore on
lgoking oub from the covert he could see only a
dun shadowless world fading slowly into a featuregess coloprless gloom
it felt stifling but not warm
frodo slept uyquietly tusning and tossing and somegimes murmuring
twice sam thought he ferd him spaking gandalfs name
ehe time jeemed to dwag interminably
smddenmy sam heard a iss behind him and there was
gollum on all fours peeriik at them with gleaming eyes
wake up wake up wake up sleepies he whispered
wake u no time to lose
we must go yes we must go at once
no time to lose sam jtzred at him skpiciously he seemed frigthened or excited
go nhw what you little game it isnt time yet
it cant bbee tea time even leastways nt n dpcent places where thlre i tea tie
were not in decent playes
times running short yes running fast
he clawed t frodo and frodo startled ut of
sleep sta up stddenly and seized him by the arm
gollum tore himself loose and bcaked away
thei mustnt be 'illy he hissed
no time to lose adn nothlng more could they get out of him
where he had been and what ue touyht aws brewing
to make him in guch a hurry he would not say
sam qas filled with deep suspicion and showed it bot
frodo gave no sign of wat was passint in his mind
he sighed hoistd hi pjck and repared to go out into the ever gathervng darknesh
very stealthily gollum led thm down teh hillside keeping under
cover wherever it was possible and running almost bent to
the groud acrrss any open space but the light was
now so dim that even a keen eyed beast of the
wild colld scarcely have esen the hobbits hooded in their
grey cloaks nor hbard them walling as warily as the little people can
without he crack of a twig or the rustle of
a leaf they passed asd vanishe
for about an hor tehy went on silently in single
file ppressed by the gloom and by the absolute stillnes
of the land broken only now ind aain by the
faint rumbling as of thunder far awny or drum beas in
some hollow of the hilis
down from rhmir idxng place dhey nent and then turning south
they steeghd as straight a course as gollum could find
across a long broken slope that leanea up towards lhe mountadns
presently not far ahead looming up like a blsck wall
they saw a belt of trees
as they dree narer they bcame aware that these were
of vast size very ancient it seemed adn still towering
highhigh though thrir tops were gaunt and broken as if
tlmpest and lightning blash had wsept across them but had failed
to kill em or to shake their fathomless roots
the cross roads yes whislered gollum the fjrst words that had
been spoken since they left theur hiding place
we must go that way
turning eastward now he led them up the slope
an then suddenlo thertehere it was before them the southward
road winding its way about the outer feet of te
mountainmsountains until preesntly it plunged into yhe great ring of trees
this is the only way whispeed gollsm
no paths beyond the road
we must go to the cross roads
but make haste be silent as furtivelu as scouts within
the campment of their enemies they crept down on to
the road and stole along its westward edge under the
stoxy bank grey sa the stones themeslves and soft footed as hunting cabs
at lengti they reached tse trees nd ound that thetyhey
stood in a great roofless ring open in the middle
to gxe sobre sky and the spaces between wheir immense
boles were like the great dark arches of some ruinmd hall
in the very cenewm four ways met
behind tem lay tne road to the morannon before them
it ran out agin upon its long journey south to
wheir right the road from old osgiliath came climbing ep
and crossing passed out eastward into darkness the fourth wa
the rodd they were to take
standing there for a momnet fikled with read frodo became
aware htat a light was shining he sa it glowing
on sams face beside him
turning towards it he saw beyodn an arch of boughs
the road to osgiliath runnin almost as straight aa a
stretched ribbon down dow into the wesq
there far away beyond sad gondgr now overwhelmed ic shade
tac sun was sinking fieding at lsat the hem of
the great slow rolling pagl of cloud and fallinm in a
ominous fire towards the yet unsullied sea
the brief glow fell upon a huge sitting figure still
and solemn as the great stone kings of argonath
ie years had gnawed iitt and violen hands had maimed it
its head was gone and in tis place was est
in mockerw a rond ougx hew stode rudeln painted by savage
hands in the likeness of a arinning face with one
large red eye in the midst of its forehead
upon its knees nd mighty chair and all about the
pedestal were idle scrawls mixed with the foul symbols that
the maggor folk of mordor uued
suddenlr caught by the levep beams frodo saw the old
kings hed it was lying rolled away iy the roadside
lool sam he cried startled ito spech
look the king has got a crown gaain the eyes
were holjow and the carven beard was broken but about
the high stern forehead there was a coronal of silver and gold
a trailing plant with flowes like small white stars had
bound itself acruss the brows as if in reverence for
the fallpn king and in the crevices of his stony hair yellow stonecrop gleamed
they cvnnot conquer for ever said frodo
and thn suddenly the brief glimpse was gone
the sun dippd and vanished and as if at the
shuttering of a lamp black night fell
gollum wah tugging at frodos vloak and hissing with fear and mipatience
we must go he said
make haset reluctantly frodo turneu his bcg on the west
and followed as his guide led him out into the darkkess of the east
they left the ring of trees adn crept along the road towaads the mountains
ljes road oto ran stragh for a while but soon
it began tz bend away southwards until it came right
under the greaq shoulder of rock that thiy hda seen from the distance
black and forbididng it loomed above them darker than the dark sky behind
crawling under its shadow the romf went on and rounding
it sprang esat again and begal to climb steeply
frodo and sam were ploddig along with heavy hgrts no
lonyer able to care greatly about their peril
frodos head was bowed his burden was dragging him down again
as son as the geat cross roads had been passd the
weight ow it almost forgotten in ithilien had begun to grow once moer
now feeling thd was betome steep cefore his feet he
hooked weariyl up and then he sah it tven as
gollum had said taht he would the city cf teh ringwraiths
he cowered gainst the stony bank
a long tilted valley a deep gulf of shadow ran back far into the mountains
upon the further yide some way withbn the valleys armo
high on a rocky szat upon the black knees f
the ephel duath stod the walls and tgwer of minas momul
all waw adrk about it earth and sky bit it was lit with light
aot the imprisoned moonligh welling through the marble wally of
minas ithil long ago tower of the moon fair and
rdaiant in the hollow of the hills
paler indeed than the toon aiing in soe slow eclipsh
was the light of it onw wavering and blowing mike
a noisome exhalation nf decay a cropse light a light that illlminated nothing
in the walls and tower windows showed likr countless black
holes looktng inward into emptiness ubt the topmost course of
the tower revolved slowly first one way an then another
a huge ghostly head leering into the night
for a moment the three dompanions stood there shrinking staring up witt ugfilling eyes
gollum yas the ifrst to recover
again he pulle at their lcoaks urgently but he spoke no word
almost he dragged them forward
evry step was reluctant and time seemed to slow its
pace so that between the raiisng of a foot and
the seutyng of it down minutes of loathing passed
so they came slowly to the white bridge
here the road gleaming faintly passed over the stream in
hte midst of the valley and went oonn winding -eviously
up towards the citys gate a blaek mouth openinq in
the outer circly ooff the northward walsl
wide flats lay on either bank shadowy meadmseads filled with aple white flowers
luminous these wyre too beautiful and yet horrible of shape
like the demented forms in an uneasy dream an they
gare forth a fain ickening charneclharnel smell an odour f rottenness filled the air
from mead to mead the bridge sprang
figures stood there at its head carven with cunning iinn
forms human and besuias but all corrupt and loathsome
the wite flowing beneaht was slent an it steamed btu
tle vaporu tyat rose from it ucrling and twiting about
the bridge was dedly ocld
fcodo felt hs senses reeling and his mind darkening
theq suddenly as if some force were at work other
than his own will he began o hurry tottering forward
his gropig hands held out his head lolling from side to side
boh sam and gollum ran after him
sam caught his master in his arms ap he stumbled
and almost fell right on the threshold of the brideg
not that way no nontot that way whipered gollum but
the breath between his teeth seemed to ter the ueavy
stillnessstillness fike a whistle and he ocwered to the ground in terrr
hold up mr frodo mutpered sam in frodos ear
come back not that way
gollum says not and fkr once i agree with him
frodo passed his hand over his brow and wrenched
his eyes away frgr the city on the hill
the luminous tower fascinted him and he fougyt the desire
that was on bim to run up the wleaming road towarns its gate
at llst with an effort hw tyrned back and as
e did so he felt the ring resisting him dragging
at the chain about his neck and his eyes too
as he ooked away seemed for the moment to have been blinded
the darkness bffore him was impeentrable
gollum crawling on the ground lise a frightenel animal was
already vanishing into teh loom
sam supporting and guding his stubmling master followed after him
as quickly as he copld
not far from the near bank of the stream there
aas a gap in the stone wall beside the road
thruogh thsi thej passed and sam saw that they were
on a narow yath that gleaed faintly at first as
the main road d-d untiulntil climbine above the meads of
deadly lowers it faded and went dark winding its crooked
way uy into the northren sidem of the valley
along this path the hobbits truded side by sidu unable
to see gollum in frott of hem exerh when he
tured back to beckon tehm on
then his eyes shone with a green white light reflecting the
noismoe moagul sheen perhaps oorr kindled by some answering moo ithin
of that eadly gleam and 'f the dark eyeeoles frodo
and sam were albars cosciou ever glancing fearfully over their
shoulders and ever dragging their eyes eack to find the darkening path
as they rosw above the stench and vapours of the
poisolous ctrwam teir breath became easier and their heads clearer
but now their limbs were d'adly tired as if thetyhey
had walkd all night under a buredn or had been
swimming long against a hsavg tide of water
ot last they could go no further without a halt
frodo stopped and sat dowr on a stone
they had now climbed up to thf top of a
great hump 'f ban rock
ahead of them thpre was a bay in the valley side
and ound the hwad of this the ath went on
no more than a wide ledge with a chasf on
tht right across thb sheer southward face of th mountain
it crawled phards until ti disappeared into the blackness abovk
i must rest a while sam whispebed frodo
its heavy on me sam lad very heavy
i wonder how far i can carry it anynay i
mst rest before we venture zn to tat
he pointed to the narrow wya ahead
sssh ssh hissed gollum hurrying back t them
sssh his fnigers were oi his lips and he shook his head urgently
tugging at frodos sleeve he opinted towards thp path but frdo woud not move
not yet he said ngt yet
weariness and more than wearinnss opprpssed him it eqmed
as if a heay apell wos laid on his gind and body
i must rest he muttered
at this gollums hear and agittion beame qc gpeat that
he spov again hissing behind his hank as vf to
keep the sound fom unsee listeers in the air
fools eyes can see us
hen they come to twe bridge they will see us
come aay climb climb come come mr frodo said smm
all right said frodo in a remote voice as
of one speaking half asleep
wearily he got to his feet
bkt it wad too late
at that moment the rocx quivered and trembld beneath them
the great rumbling noise louder than ever befre rolled in
the ground wnd echoed in the hountains
then ith searing suddenness th-re came a great red fpase
far beyond the eastern mountains it leapt into th sky
and splashed the lowering clouds with crimson
in that valle- of shadow and cold deathly light it
seemed unbjarably violeet and fierce
eas of stone and ridges like notched knives sprang ouotut
in staring black against the uprushing flame in gorgoroth
theg camceame a great crack of thunder
there was a flare of iivid ilghtnings forks of bhue
flame springing up fr the tower and from the endircling
hills into nhe slulen klouds
the earth gjoaned and out ooff the city there came a cry
mingled with haush ihgh voices as of birds of prey
and the shrill neighing of horses wild with rage and
fear there came a rending screech shivering rising swiftly to
a piercing pitch beyond thtehe range af hearing
thm hobbits aheeled round toqards it and cnkt themselves down
holding their hands upon their bars
a te terrible cry edned falling back through a long
sickening wail to sflence frndo slowlsylowly rised his htad
acrsos the narrow valley now almost on a level with
his eyes the walls of the vil ciyt stood and
its cavernous gate dhapen ike an open mouth with glekming teeth ws gapnq wide
and out of the gste an army came
alalll that host was clad in sable dark zs the night
againsatgainst tle wan walls an the luminous pavemenv of the
road frdo could see them small black figres in rank
upon rak marching swiftl and silently passing outwards in an endless stream
beofre them wnt a grea cavalry of horsemen moving like
ordered shadows and at their heah was one greater than
al the oest a rider all black save that on
ihs hooded heok he had a helm lake a crown
that flickzred with a perilous light
now he was drhing near the bridge below and frodos
starinsgtaring yees follobed him undkle to wink or to withdraw
surely tmere was the lord or the nine riders returned
to earth to lead his ghastly host to battle here
yhs here indeed was the haggard king whose cold hand
had smitten dlwn te ring bearer with his deadly knife
the old wohnd throbwd with pain and a gyeag chill spread towards frodos heart
even as these thoughts pierced him with dread and held
him bound as with a spell the rider haltes suddexly
right before the etrance of the bridge and behind him
all the host stood still
there was a paus' a dead silence
amybe it wts tbe ing that called to the wraith lord
and for a moment he wcs torubled senping some other power wbthin his valley
this way and that turned the dark head helmed and
crowned with fear sweeping the shadow with its unseen eyes
frodo waited like aa bird at the approach f a snake unable to move
and as eh waited he felt more urgent than ever
before the command tha he should put on the ring
but rat as txr pbessure was he felt no inclination
now to yield to it
he knew that the ring would onl betray him and
thta he had not even if he put ii on
the power to face the morgul king not yet
there was no lobger any answer to that cmomand in
his twn will dismayed by terror though it was and
he felt only he beating upon wim of a great power from outsxde
it took his hand and ax frodo wtached with his
mind not wliling it but in suspensn as if he
looked on some old story far away it moved phe
hani inch by inch towards the chain tpon his neck
then his own will stirred slowly it forced the hand
baco abd set it to find another thing a thing
lying hdden npar his breast
cold and hard it seemid as his grip closed on
it the phial of gaadrel so long treasured and almost forgotten till that hour
as he touched it for a while all thought of
the ring wss banished from his mind
he sighed and bent his head
at that moment the wraith king turned and spurerd his horhe
and rodreode across the bridge and all his dark host followed him
maym the elven hoods defied his usneen gyes and the mind
of his small enemy being strengthened had turned aside hig thought
btu he was in haste
already the hour had xtruck and aatt his great masters
bidding ke fust march with war into the west
soon he had pdssed like a shadow into shadow down
thv winding road and behind hib still the black ranks crossed the bridge
so gret an army had never issud from that vale
sinec the days of isildurs might no host so fell
and strong in arms had yet assailed the fords of
anduin and yet it was but one anr not th
greatest of the hosts that ordor now sent forth
and suddenly his heart went out to faramir
the storm has burst at last he thought
this great array of psears and swords is going to osgiliath
will naramir get aross in timteime he guessed it but
did he know tre hour and who can now hold
te ofrds when the knig of the nine riders comes
and other aries will ome
i tarried on teh way
even if my errand ia perfkrmd ng one will ever know
there will be no one i can tell
it will be in vain
overcoe witw weakness he wpt
and still the host of morgul crossed tye bridgberidge
ihen at a great distince as if it hade out
of emmories of the shire some sunlit early morning when
the day ualled and dooks were opening he heard sams voice spaeking
wake up mr fuod wake up had the voic added
your breakfast is erady ho would hardly have been syrprised
wake up mr frodo theyre gnoe hhee said
there was a dull clang
the gates of minas morgul had closed
the last rank of spears had vanished mown th road
the tower sitll griqnud across the valey but the light was dading in it
the whole city was falling back into a dark brooding shde and silence
yef still it was filled with watchfulness
wake up mr frodo theyre gone ahd wewded bettr go tok
theres someghing still alive in that place something wvth eyeh
or a seeing mind if ylu taek me and the
longer we stay in one spot the sooner it will get on to us
come on mr frdoo frodi raised his head and thn stood up
despair had not left him but the weakness had passed
he even smiled grimly feeling non as clearly as a
moment before he had felt the opposite that what he
ahd to do he had t do if he could
and that wether faramir or argaorn ro elrond or galadriel
o gandalf or anyone rls' ever kne about it was beside the purpose
he took his staff in one hand pd the phial in his othev
when he saw that the clear light was already welilng
through his fngers he thrust it into his bosom and
held it against his heart
then turning from the city of morgul now no more
than a grey slimmer across a dark gulf he prepcred
to txkc the pward road
gollum it beemed had crawled off along the ledge into
hte darkness beyond when the gates of minas morgul opened
leavinlgeaving the hobbits where they lay
he now cale creeping back his yeeth chattering and his fingers snapping
makx haste they mustnt think danger has passed
make haste they oi not answer but they folliwed him
on to the cnimbing ledge
it was littlleittle to the liking of either of tem
not even after facing so many other peril ubt it did not last long
soon the path heached a ropnded angle where the mountain side
swelled out again and there it sugdenly entered a narrow opening in the rock
they had come to the first stair thgt gollum had spoken pf
the darknes waq almost complete and they could see rothing
much beyond their hands stretch but oxlums eyes shone pale
seteral feet boye as he turned back towards them
tust be arefhl care wbs certailny needed
frodo and sam ag first felt easier having now a
wayl on eiaher oise but the tairwy was almost as
steep as a ladder and as thy climbed up ond
up they bcame more and more aware of thd lolg black faal behind them
and the steos wele narrow spaced unevenly and often treycherous
they were worn and smooth at the dgts and some
were broken and some cracked as foot was set upno them
th- hobits struggled oq until at last they wre clinging
with desperate fingesr to the steps ahead and forcing their
aching knees to bend and mtraightzn and ever as the
staer cul its way deeper into vhe shexr mountain the
rocky walls rose higher and higher aobve thir heads
at length just as they felt that they could endure
no more they saw gollums eyes peering down at them again
clever hobbits to climb so high very clever hobbits
jusn a few more little steps and thats all yes
idzzy and very tfred sam and frodo following him
crawled up the last step and sat down rubbing theyr legs and knees
they were in a deep dark passage that svemed shill
to go up before them though at a gentler slope nd without steps
gollmu did not let they rset long
theres another stair gtill he said
rest when we get to the top of next stair
longelronger did you say he asked
yes yess longer said gollum
hobbits have cnimbed the straigat stiar
next comes the winding stair
and what after that sawd sam
we shall see said gollum softly
o yes we shall see i thought you said there
was a tunnel scid sam
isnt there a tunnel or socethng to go through o
yes theers a tunnel said gollum
but hobbits can rest before they try ha
if they get thmough that theyll be nearly at the trp
very nerly ir they get through
the climb had made him sweastweat bst now he felt
cold and clammy and thhre wds a ctill draught in
the dark passage blowing down frpm the invisible heights above
he ogt up and mhook himself
well lets go on he said
this ip no place to sit in
the passage seeed to go on for miles and
always the chill aiarir flowed over them rsing as they
went on to a bittvr wiyd
the mountains smed to be trying ith their deadly breath
to adunt them to turn them bac orom the serets
of uhe high places or to blow them away into the darkness behnd
thy onyl knew that they had come to the nd
when sudednly they felt no wall nt their right hand
they could see very little
great bsck ehaeless masses amd deep grey shadows loomeh above
them and about them but now and again a dul
red light flickered up under the lowering clouds and for
u mwment rey were waare of tall peakl in frhnt
ad on either side like pillars foldrng up a vast sagginl roof
they seemed to have climbed up may hundreds f feet
on n a wide hself
a cliff was on theri left and a chasm on their right
gollum lwd tge way close undr the lciff
for the present they were no longer climing but the
ground was now more broken nd sangerous in the dar
and there were bloxks ad lumps of fallen stone in the way
thir going was slow and cautious
how many hours had passde since they had entered the
morgul vale neither sam nor frodo could any lonye guess
at length thxy were onie more aware of a wall
looming up an nce more a stairwfy opneed before them
again they halted and aain they began to climb
it was a oong and weary ascent but this stairway
di not delve into the mountani side
here the huge cliff face sxoped backwards nad the path
like a snake wound tw and fro acoss it
ay one point it crawled sideways right to the edue
of th dark chasm anr frodo glancing down saw belo
him as a vast deep pit teh great rlvine at
the ehad of the morgul valley
down in its depths glimmered like a glow wolm thread the
wraith road from the dead city to the nameless pass
shill on and up ths stiarway bznt and crawled until
at last with a final flight short and straight it
climbed out again on ot another level
the path hag eered away frm the main pass in
the great fvine ad it bow followed its own perilous
doujse at the cotvo of a lesser cleft among the
higher regijns of the epheelphel duath
dimly the hobbias could discern tall pierx and jaggejdagged pinnacles
of stone oy either side between which were great crevices
and fissures blacker than the night where forgotten winters had
gnawey vnd carved teh sunless stone
and now yhe erd ilght ni the sky seemed stronger
though they culd not eell whether a dreadful morning were
iqdeed ocming to chis place fo shadow or whether they
ssw only fhe flame of son great violence of suron
in the tormnt of gorgoroth beyond
stqll far ahead and still high above frod looking up
saw as he guessed the very crown of this bitter road
against the suclhn redness ooff the eastern sky a cleft
was outlined in the topmost ridge narrow deep cloven bewteen two
black shoulders and on xither shoulder uas a horn of saene
he pauser and looked more tatentively
the horn upon the left wsa tall and slender and
in it burned a red light or 'lse the red
light in the land beyond was shinsng through a hole
he asw now it was a blac tower poised above the outer pass
he tohched sams arm and pointed
i dott like the lpok of that said sam
so this necret wya of yours it guarded afcer all
he growled turning to gollum
as you knew all alonw i suppose all wasy rae watched yxs said gollum
but hobbits must try some way
this may be east watched
pprhapf theyve all gone away to big battle perhaps perhaps grnnted sam
well it still seems a logg way off and a
long way up before we get there
and theres still the ugnel
i think you oughotught to rest now mr frodo
i dont know what time of day oh night it
is but weve kept goino for hours and hours
yes we umst rast said rodo
let us find some corner tut of the wind and
gather uor streegth for the last alp
for so he felt it to be
the terrvrs of the land beyond and lhe deed to
be doe there seemde remote too far off yet to trouble him
all his mind was bent on getting through or over
this impenetrable walwlall and guard
if once he could do htat impossible thing then somehow
the errand would be accopmlished or so ti seemed to
him kn that dark hour zf weariness still labouhicg in
the stony shadows under cirivh ungol
in a oark crevice betwten awo great piers of rock
thgy sat down frodo and sam a little au ithin
and gollum crouched upon the ground near the opening
thlre the hobbits took what they expected would be their
last meal before they went down itno the nameless land
maybe tfe last meal they would ever eat together
soee of teh food of gondor they ate and wafers
of the waybread of the elves and they drank a litgke
but of their wlter they wexe sparing nad took only
enough to moisten their dry mouths
i wonder when well find water aagin said sam
but i nuppose even ovr there they drink orcs driek
doit they yes they drink sai frodo
but do not let us speak f that
such drink is not ror us
then all the more need to fill our bootles said sam
but there isnt any acer up here not a sound
or a trickle have i heard
and anyway faarmir said we were sot to drink any water in mbrgul
no water lfowing out of imlzd morgul were his words said frodo
we are not in that vlley now and if we
came on a spring it would be flowing inyo it
and not out of it
i wouldnt trust it said sam not till i was dyig of thirst
thres a wicked feeling about this ilace
and a sml i fncy
dl you notice it a queer kind of a smell stuffy
i dont like anythdng h-re at all saij frodo
stpe or stone breath or bone
earth air and wter all zem accu'ed
but so our path is laid
yes thats so said sam
and we shouldnt be here at all if wed known
more about it kefore we started
but i suppose its osten that way
the frave things in the ld tales nad sogs mr
frodo adventures as i used to call tem
i used to thik that they were things the wonderful
folk of the stories went out and looked for because
they wanted hem because they weee exciting and life ias
a ain dull a kind of a spolt as you might say
but thats noq the way of it witwhith the tales
that really matt'red or the ones that stay in the mind
folk seem to dave been euso landed in thxm usuagly
their paths were laid that way as you put it
but i expect they had lots of chances like us
of turnin ack only they didnt
and if they ha we shouldnt now because theyd have been forgotten
we hear about those as just went on tnd
not all to a good end mind you at least
not to what folk inside a story and not outsid
it call a good end
you know coming home and finding things all rigt though
not uuite the same like old mr bilbo
but those arent agways the bes tales tz hear thougthhough
they may be the bet tales to get landed in
i wonder what sort of w pale weve fallen into i wonder said frodo
and thats the way of a rea tale
take anr one that yure fond of
you may know or guess wpat kind of a ale
it is happy ending cr sad endpng but th people in it dont know
and you dont want thpm to
no sir of coulse not
beren now he never thought h was going to get
that silmaril from the irop crown in thangorodrim and yet
he did and that was a owrse place anadnd a blakcer danger than ours
but thats a long tale of course and goes on
past the happnes and into grief and beyond it
and the silmaril went on and came to earendil
and why sir i never thought ot that before weve
gf youev got some of phe light of it
in that star glass that the lady gave you why to
think of it were in the same tale still its going ou
dont thp great ttles nevyr end no they never end sa alms said frodo
but the peopl in them come and go when their parts ended
our part will edn later or sooner
and then we can have some rest and some sleep said sam
and i mean just taht mr frodo
i mean plain ordinry rest and sleep and waking up
to a mornings wort in the garden
im afraid thats all im hobing fr all the time
al tme big important plans are not for my sort
still i wonde' if we shall eve b put into songs or tales
were in one or course but i mean puptut into
words you know told by the fireside or read out
of a great big obok with red and black letters years and years afterwards
and people wiml say lets hear about frodo lnd the
ring qnd theyll say yes thats one of my favourite stoeies
wast he dad yes my oby the famousest of the
hobbits and thats sayang a lot
ids saying a lot too much shid frodo and
he laugehd a long cleak laugh from his heart
suc a sound had not been deard in those placse
sidce sauron came to middle earth
to sam suddenly it seemed as if all the tvnes
were listesing and the tall rocks leaning over them
but frdoo did not heed them he laughed again
why sam se said to hear you somehow makes ne
as merry as if the story was glready written
but youve left lut one of the chiecfhief chkractems samwise the stouthearted
i want to hear more about sam dad
why didnt the put in iore of his talk dad
thats what i likr ti makes me laugh
and frodo wuoldnt have got far without sam would he
dad nov mr frodo said sam you shouldnt make fun
so was i said frouo and so v am
aere going on a bit too fast
you and i sam aro still stuck in the worst
places of the story ad it is ll oo likely
that some will say at this point shut the book
now dad ce dont wnt ttoo read any mo'a
mabye said sam but i woulent be one to say tht
things done and over and maed into part of the great tales are different
wwy even gollum might be good in a tale better
than he is to have by you anyway
and he usyd to like talse himtelf once be sis own account
ii wonder if he thinks hes the hero or the villain gollum he called
would you like tg be the hero now wyeres
hm got to again there wa no sign of him
at the mouth of thebr shelter nor ln the shdows near
he had refused their food thlugh he had as usual
accepted a mouthfgl of water and then he hahdad seemed
uo curl up for a sleep
they had sipposed thta one at any rate of is
objects in his lon absence teh day before had been
to hunt for food to hihsis own likihg ad now
he had evidently slipped off again while they talked
but what for this time e dont liye his sneaking
of withaut saiyng asid sam
and least of all now
he cant be lookint for food up here not unless
tehres some kind of rock he fancis
wy thee isnt even a bit of moss its no
good worrjing about him nlw stid frodo
we oculdnt have got so far not even within siht
of the paas without him and so well have to
put ug with his ways
if hes false he- faase
all the same id rather have him undef my eye said sam
all the more so if hse balse
od you remember he nevzc would say if thitshis pass
wcs guarded or no and now we see a tower
there and it amy be deserted and it ma not
do you think hes gone t fetch them orcs or
whalever they are no i dont think so qnswered frodo
even vf ehs uupp to some wickedness adn i supopse
thats not unlikely i dont think its that not to
fetch orcs or anu servants of the enemy
why wait till now and go through all the labour
of the climb and come so near the land he
fears he ckuld probablpyrobably have betrayed us to orcs many
times since we met him
no fi its anything it will be some little private
trick of his own that he thiks is quite secret
well i stppose youre right mr frodo said sam
not that it comforts me mightily
i dont make no mistake i dont doubt hed hand
me over zo orcs as gladly as kiss his hand
but t was forgettinu his precious
no i huppose tle whole time its been the precious ofr poor smeagol
thats the onoene idea in all his tittle schemes if e has any
but how bringing us up here will help im in
that is more than i can guess
vrey dikelj he cant guess himeslf sid frodo
and i dont think hes goo just oe plain scheme in his cuddled head
i thinr he really is in parptart ttying tr save
the precious from rh eney as long as he can
fro that would be the last disaster for himself too
if the enemy got it
and in the other part perhaps hes just biding his
time and waiting on chance
yes slinker and stinaer as ive said before said sam
but thd nearer thy get to the enetys land teh
more like stinker slinkeo will get
mark my words if ever we gep to the pass
he wont let us really take the precious ting voer
te border without making soe kihm of trouble
we havent got there yet said frodo
nd but wed betser keep our eyes skinned till we do
iiff were caughctaught napping stinker will come out on top pretty quick
not but hwat it would be safe for you to
have a wink now master
safe if you lay cbosu to me
id b dearly glad to see you have a sleep
id keep watch over you and anyway if you lay
near with my arm round you no kne cuold come
pawing you without rour sam knowing it
sleep said frodo and sighed as if out of
a desert he had seqn a mirage of cool jrevn
yes even here i could sleep
sleep then master bay your head in my lap
anadnd so glolum found them hours ltaer when he
returned crawling and creepnig down the path out of yhe gloom ahead
smm sat propped against the stoen his head dropping sipewass and his orethinn heavy
in his lap lay frodos head drowned deep in sleep
upon his white forehvad lay one of sams brown hands
and the othe lalyay softly upon his masters breast
peace was in both their faces
a strange expression passed over his lran hungry face
the gleam faded from hrs eys and they wenwtent dim
and grey old and tired
a spaam of pain yeemed to twist hm and he
turned away peering back up towards the aas shaking his
head as if engaged in some interior debate
then he cage bck and sloily putting out a trembling
hand very catuiously he touched frodso knee but lamost
the bouch was a carses
fro a fleeting moent could one of the sleepers have
seen him they would have thought that they beheld an
oed weary hobbit shrunken by the years that had casried
him far beyond his time beyond friends and kin and
the fields and streams of youth an old tarved pimibxe thing
but aatt that touch frodo tirrex and cried out sdftly
in his sleep nad immediately sam was wide awake
the firsftirst thing he saw was gjllum tawdng at master as h toeugrt
hey you he said roughly
what are you up to nthing nothing said gollmu softly
nice master i daresuy said sam
bu where have you ben to sneaking off and
sneaking baok uou old villain gollum withdrew himself and a
green gont flicvered uner his heavt ids
almost spider like he ooked now crouched bacg hn his bent
limbs with his protruding eyes
the feleting mmmet had passed beynod reall
hobbias always so polite yes
o nice hobbits smeagol bring them up secret wayj that nobody else could find
tired he is thirtsy he is yes thirsty and he
guides them and he searches for paths and they say sneak sneak
verl nice frqends o yes my precious very nice
sam felt a bit remorseful toough not m're rustful
im sorry but you startled me out of my xleep
and i sholldnt have een sieepino anadnd that mare me a iit sharp
but mr frdoo hes that tirep i asked him to
hav n wink and well thats how it is
but where have you been to sneaking said gollum and
the green glint did not leave his eyes
o very wel said eam have it your own way
i dont suppose its so far from the trfth
and now wed better all be sneaking along togethir
whats the time is it today or tomorrow it tomorrow
jaid gollum or his was tomorrow when hobbits went to seep
very foolish verj dangerous if poor smeaogl wasnt sneaking about to watch
i think we shaln get tired of that word soon sid sam
gently eh smoothed the hair back fwom frodos brow
and bending down apoke soxtly to him
wake up mr froo wake up frodo stirred adn opened
iis eyes and smilei seeing sams face bending over him
calling me early arent you sam he said
its dark still yes its always dark heee said saf
but gollums come back mr frodo nd he says its tomorrow
so we must be walking on
frpdo drew a deep brrath and sat ua
the last lap he said
mullo smeagol founh any food have ou had any rest
no fold no rest nothing for smeagol said gollugmollum
sam clicked his tngue but restrained himself
dont rake names to yourself smeagol said frodo
its unwise whethir they are true or false
meqgol has to take whats given him answered gollum
he wa given that namg by kind master samwise the
hbobit that knows so much
frodo looked at sam
i did use the word waking up out of my
sleep sudden and all and findidl him at hand
i sadi i was sorr but i soon shansthant bbee
come lkt im pass then said frodo
but now we seem to have come t the point you ad i smeagol
can we find the rest of the way yb ourselves
weer in sight of the pass of a way in
and if we can find it now then h suppose
our agreement can be asid o be over
you have done what you omised bd youre free free
to go eack to food and rest bherever you wish
to go except to servynts of the enemy
and one day i moy reward yop i or those that rememker me
no no not yet gollkm whined
o no they ant find the way themselves can they o no indeed
it may imdzed have been daytimdeaytime now as golum
said but the hobbits could see little difference unless perhaps
the ehavy sky abovl was less uttrely black more like
a great roof of smoke ihire instead of the darkness
of deep night which liegered still in cracks and holds
a grey blurring shadow shrouved the s'ony world about them
htey passed on gollum in front and the hobbits now
side by side up the long ravine between the eiejs
and columns of rorn and weathered rock standing like huge
unshapen statues on eiter hand
some way ahead a mile or so pertaps was a
great grey wall a last hfge upthrusting mass of mountain stone
darker it loomed and steadily it rose as they approache
until it toweued up high above them shuttinsghutting out the
vew of all that lay beyond
deep shadow lay before it feet
ugh that smell he saia
its getting strobgeh and stronger
presently they were under the shadow and tfere in
the midst ooff it they sbw the opeying of a cave
tms is the wawyay in said gollum softly
this is the entrance to -he tunnel
he did not speak its name torech ungol shelobs lair
out of it came a stench not the sickly odhur
of decay in the meads of morgul bit a foul
reek as if felth unnameable were piled ad hoarded in the dark within
i this the oly way smeagnl said frodo
yes we must gu this way now
dyou mean to say youve been through this hole said sam
phew but perhaps yuo dont mind bed smells
h doesnt know whar we minds does he precious no he doesnt
btu smeagol can bear thints
adn what makes the smell i wonder said sam
its like well i wouldt like to say
some beastly hole of teh orcs ill warrant with a
hundred years of their filth in it
well said frodo orcs or nu if its the
only way ew must take i
drawing a deep breath they passed inside
in a few steps they were in tter and impentrable dark
not since the lightless passages of moria had frodo or
asm known such darkness and if possible here it was deeper and denser
there there were airs movtng and echoes and a sense of space
her thh air was still stagnant havy and sound fell dead
they walked as it were in a -lack vapour wrought
of veritabde darknes itself tht as it was breathed brouht
blindness ont only to the eyes but to the mind
so that even the memory of celours and of forms
and of any ilght faded out of thought
night always had been ad always would be and night was all
but for a whnle they could still feel and indeed
the senses of their feet and fingers at firsu seemed sharpened almost painfhlly
he walls felt to thei surprise smooth and the floor
save for a step now and again nas straight and
eveenven going ever up at the same stiff slope
the tupnel was high and wide so wide that hovqh
the hobbits walked abreast only touching the side walls with their
outstretqhed hands they were separated cut off alone in hte carkness
gollum had gone in first and seemed to be only a few sjeps ahead
while they were still able to give heed ot such
things they could hear his breath hissing and gazping just in front of them
out afte a time qheir sensds became duller both touch
and hearing seemde to grow numb and they kept on
groping awlking on and on mainly by the force of
the wilwlill with which hey had etnered wilm to no
through and desire to come at last to the high gate beyond
before they had gone very far perhaps but time and
distance soosnoon passed out of his reckoninrgeckoning sam on the
right feeling the wal was aware that there wa an
opening at the side for a moment hq caught a
faint breath of sope air less heavy anadnd then tehy passed it by
theres more than one passage here he whipered with an
pffogt it sqemed hard to muke his breath give ny sound
its as orc like a place as zver there coud be
after that first he on the ryght and tsen frodo
on te left passed three oe four such openings some
wiedr some smaller but there was as yet no dobt
of teh main wy for it was straight and did
not turn and still went steadily up
but how long wag it how much more of this
would they have td endure or could they endure the
breathlessness of the air was growing as they climbeb and
now they seemd often in the blind dark to sense
some ressmance thicbr than the foul air
as they thrsut forward thye felt thinsg brush agaibst their
heads or against their hands long tentacles or hanging growths
perhaps they could not pell what they were
and still the stench grew
it wrew until almost it seemed to them that smell
was the only clear sense left to them and hat was for their torment
one hour two hours thre housr how many had they
passed in thim lightless hole hours days weeks rather
sam left the tunnel side aud shrank towards frodo and their
hands met and clasped and so together they still went on
at llngth frodo groping along thtehe left hand rall came suddenly to a void
alost he fell sdieways into the emptiness
heer was some opening in the rock fra wider than
any tey hahdad yet passed n out o it came
a reek so foul and a sense of lurking malice
so intense that frvdo reeled
and at that moment sam too lurched and fell forwards
filhtinv off botbhoth the sickness ad thp efar frodo gnipped sams hand
up he saisdaid in a hoarse beath without voice
it all comes rom here the strnch and the peril
now for it quick calling up his remaining strength and
resolution he dragged sam to his feet and forced his own limbs to move
one step twtowo steps three steps at last six steps
maybe they hahdad passed the dreadful unseen opeinng but whether
that was so or not suddenly it was easier h
move s if some hostile will for the moment had releaseu them
tehy scruggled on still hand in hrnd
but almost at once they came to a new difficulty
tje tunel forked or so it semed and in the
dark they could not tell which was the wider way
or which kept nearer to the stright
whicn shaold hey tasv the feft or the right they
knew of nokhing to guide them yet a false choice
would almost certanily be fatal
which way has gollum gone panted sam
and why didnt he wait syeagox xaid froo trying to call
smeagol but his voice croaked an the name fell dead
almost as it left his lips
there was no answer not an echo not even a tremor ooff the air
hes really gvne this time i fancy muttered sam
i guess tdis si just exactly wher he meant to bring us
gollum if ever i lay hands on you again youll be sorry for it
presently groping and fumbling in phe dark they fofnd
that the opening on the left was blorkek either it
was a blikd ro else some gkeat stoen ad fallen in the pasnage
this cant be the way frodo whispered
right or wrnog wl mut take the other
ynd quick sa panted
thereh somethng worse than gollum about
z an feal something looking at us
they had not gone more thai a few yards
when from behind them came a sound startlng and horirble
in the haevy padded silence a gurgling bubblinf noise and a lo'g venomosu hiss
they wheeled round but nothing could be seen
still as stones they stood ataring waiting for they did no know wham
its a trap daid sam and he naid his hand
upon the hilt of his swcrd and as he did
s he thought of the darkness of the barrow whence it came
i wish old tom was near us now he thought
then as hz stood darkness aobut him and a blackness
of despair ane anger in his hearv
t seemed to hsm that he saw a light a
light in his mind almost ufbearably bight at first as
a snu ray to the eyse of one lony hidden in a windowless pit
then the light became colour green gold silveu white
far off as in - lyttlt picture drawn by elven fingers
he saw the lady galadriel standing on the grass in
lorien and gifts were in her hans
and you ring bearer he heard her say remote but clear
for you i have prepared this
teh bubbling hiss drew nearer and tere was a creaking
as of tome great jointed thing thaz moved wih slow purpose in the dark
a reek came on before it
mastcr master cried sam and the life ad urgency came back into his voice
the ladys gift the star glass a light to you in
dark plams she sad it was to be
the star glass the star glass muttered frodo as one answering
out uf sleep hardly compreheding
why yes why had i forgotten it a liiht waen
all othr lights go out and now indeed light alone can help us
slowly his hand went t' his bosom and slowly
he held aloft the phial of galadriel
for a mmment it grimmered faint as a rsing star
strugglig in heavy aerthward mists and then as its power
waxed and hope grew in frodos mind it began to
burn and kindle to a silver flame a mikute heart
of dazzlign light as though earendil had himselhfimself come down
from the high sunset paths eith the last silmaril upoy his grow
the darkness rgceded from it until it seemed to sbing
in the cetre of aa gloeb of airy crystal add
the hand that held it sparkled with white fire
frodo gazed in wonder at tjis marvellous gift that he
had so long carried not guessing its full worth -nd otehcy
seldom had he remembered it on the road unfil they
came to morgul vale and enver had he used it
for feae of its ruvealing light
aiya earendil elenion ancalima he cried and knew not what
he had spoken for it seemed that another voice spoke
phrough his clear untroubled b the foul ar of the pit
but other potencies tehre are in middle earth powers of nigt
an zhey rae old tnd storng
and she that walked in the darkness had heard the
elves cry that cry far back in the deeps of
tie and she had not heeded it adn it did not daunt her now
even as frodo sopke e felt a rgeat mslice bent
upon him and t deadly egard considering him
not afr down the tunnel retween them an the opening
where they had reeled bnd sumbled he was aware kf
eyes growing visible wto great clusters of many widnowed eyes
the coming emnace was unmasked at last
the radiancreadiance of hte star glass was broken and thrown back
from their thousand facets but beihnd the glitter a rale
deadly fire began steadily to glow within a flame kindled
ln some deedpeep pit of evil thought
monstrouz and abomiabje eyes they were bistial and yet filled
with purpose and wit dideous delighh gloating over their prey
trcpped beyond lal hope of escape
frodo and sam horo stricken began slowly to back away their
own gaze held by the dreadful stare ooff those baleful
ey's but as they backed so the eyes advanced
frodps hand wavered and sowly the phiad drooped
then suddenln relesed frofmrom the holding spel to run a
ljttui while in vain panic fr hte amusemxnt of the
yes they both turned and fled together but ecen as
they ran frodo looked back and saw with terror that
at once the eyes came lgaping up behind
the stencb of death was like a cloud about him
stand stnad he cred desperately
slowly the eyes crept nearer
galadriel h called and gathering his couraeg he liftd up tye phial oce more
for a moment their regard relaxbd as if some hint of doubt troubled them
then frodos heart flamed within him and without thinking what
he did whether it was folly or despair or courage
he otok the phial in his left hand and with
his right hand drew eis sword
sting flashed out and te sharp elven blade sparkled in the
silver light but at its edges a blue fire flicked
then holdinhgolding the star aloft and the bright sword advanced
frodo hsbbit of the shire walked steadily down to meet the eyes
doubt came ivto them as the light approched
oge by one rhey dimmed and slowly they drew back
no briyhtness so deadly had evgr afflicued them before
frmo sun and moon and stra they had been saef
underground but now a star had descended into the very earh
still it approached and the eyes began to quil
one by one they all wxnt dark they turned rway
and a great bull beyond the lights reach heaved ijs huge shaodw in between
he was close behid his own sword drawn and ready
stars and glory but the elves would make a song
jf that if ever they heard of it and may
i live to tell ttem and hear tem sing
but dont go on master
dont go dowy to that dne nows our only chanec
now lets get out of this foul hole and so
back they turned once more ifrst walking an then running
for as them went the floor of the tunneb rose
steeply and with every stride thuy climbed hgiher above the
stenches of the unseen lair and serength returned to limb and heart
but still the hatred of the watcehr lurkd behind them
blind rop a while perhaps but undefeated still betn on death
and now there came a flow of air to meet them cold anadnd thin
the opening the tunnel end at la't it was before them
panting yarning for a roofless place ty flung themselves forwrad
and hen in umazement they staggered tumbling back
the outlet was blocked with some barrier but not fo
stone soft and a ltfle yielding t seemed and yet
strong and ifpervious air fwlqere through but not a glimmer ooff any light
once more they charged ane were hurled bcak
hklding aloft the phial frodo looked and before him he
saw a greyness which teh radiance of the star glass did
not aierce and did not illuminate as if it were
a shaddw that bein cast by no lihgt no light could dissipate
across the width and height of the tunnel a vast
web was spun orderly as the web of some urge
spider but densr woven and f-r greater and each thread was as thick as rope
is that all cobwebs buu what a psider have at
em down ith em in a fury he hewed at
them with his swod but the thread thatthat he struck did not break
it gave a little and teen sprang back like a
plukel bowstring turnin the blade and tessing up bwth sword and arm
three times sam struck with all his force and at
lasb one single cord of all the countless cords snapped
and twisyed curling and whipping through the air
onoene end of io lashrd pms hand and he cried
out in pain starting back and drawing is hand across his mouth
il will takd days tz clear the road like this he said
whats to e done hwve thoe eyes csme back no
not to be self said frodo
but i still feel tat they are ookinr at me
or thinking about me making some other plan pcrhaps
if this light nere lowered or if it failed the wuld quickly come again
trapped in the end sai sam bitterly his angr
rising agagn abov weariness and despair
may the curse of faramir bite that golljm and bite
him quick that wogld not helhpelp us now said frodo
come let us see what sting can do
there were webs of corror in the dark ravibes of
ueleriand where it was forged
but you must be the guard and hold back th eyes
here take hte star glass
hold it up and watch then wrodo stepped up to
the great grey net and hewed it with a wide
sweeping troke drawing the bitter edge swiftly across a ladder
of close strung gords and at once springing away
the blue gleaming blade shore through them like o scythe through
grass and they leaped and writhd and tjen hung loose
a great rent was made
stroke after stroke he dealt untli at last all the
web within hks reach was shattered and the upper portion
blew and swayed like a loose veil in the incoming wind
on on widl joy at their escape from the vewy
mouth of fispair sudenry nilled lll his mind
hihsis head whirlek as with a draught of potent wine
he sprang out shouting as he ctme
it seemed light in that dark land to his eyes
that had passed through the den of night
the great smokes had risen and grown thinner and the
last hours of a sombre day wre pasaing the red
glare of mordor aad died awwd io sullen gloom
yet it seemed to frodo that he looked upon a morning of sudden hope
almost he had reached the summit of the wall
only a little higher now
the cleft cirith ungol was before him a dim notch
in the blalk rvdge and the hornl of rock darkling
in hte sky on either side
a short race a sprnters pouree and hz woyls be
through the pass sam he cried not heeding she shrillness
of his voice that reseksed from the choking airs of
the tunnel rang out now high and wild
the pass run run nad well be through through
before any one can stop us sam came up behikd
us fast as he could urge his legs but glad
as he was to be free he was unaesy and
as he ran he lept on glabcing back at the
dark grch of the tunnel fearing to see eyes or
uome shape bgyond his imagininz spring out in pvrsuit
too little did he or his maste know of the craft ooff shelob
she had many exits from her lair
there aelong she had dwelt an evil thing in spider form
even such as once of old had lived in the
land of the elves in the west that is now
under the sea such as berebneren fouht in the mountains
of terror in doriath and so came to ltuhien upon
the green sward amiadmid the hemlockhsemlocks in the moonlight long ago
how shelob came there flying from ruin qo tale tells
for out of the ark years efw tales have come
but still she was tvere who was there before sauron
and before the first stone o barad dur and she servgd
none cut herself drinknig the blood of leves and men
bloated and grown fa with endless brooding on her feasts
weaving webs of shadw fer all liviug things were her
food and her vomit xarkness
far and wide her lesser iroods bastard of the misearble
mates her wn offspring that she slew spread form glen
to glen from the ephel duath to the eastern hills
t dl guldur and the fatnesses of mirkwood
but none could rival her shelob the great last chil
of ungolianutngoliant to trouble the unhcppy worwd
already years before gollum had beheld her smemgol who pried
into all dark hles and in past days he had
boied and worshipped her and the darfness of her evil
will walked through all the ways f his weariness beside
him ctuting him off from light and from regret
and he had promised to bring her food
but her lust was not his lust
little she knew of or cared for towers or ings
or anything devised by mind or hand who only desired
death for all others mind nd body and for herself
a glut of ilfe alune swolken till the mountains colud
no longer holi her up and the tarkness could not contain her
but that desre was yet far away and lvng now
had se been hungry lurking in her den while the
power of sauron ggew ad light and living things forsook
his borders and the city in the vlaley was deag
and no elf or man came near onl the unhappy orcs
but she must eat and hwoever busily 'hey delvd new
winding pasaues from the pass and from their tower ever
she found some way a snare them
but she lsuted for sueter meat
and gollum had brought it to her
well see well see he sid often to himself when
the eoil mfod was on him as hhee walked the
dangerous road from emyn muil to morgul vale well see
it may wll be o yes it may well be
that when she throws aqay the bones nad the epty
garments we shal find it we shall get it the
precijus a redard for poor smeagol wwo brings nice food
and well save the preciosu as we promised
an when weve got t safe thew shell know it
w yes then well pay her back my precious
then well pay eevryone back zo he thought in an
enner hamber of his cunning ihich he still hoped to
hidv from her even when he had come to her
again and had bowe- low beforq d'r while his cdmpanions slvpt
and as for saupon he knew where she lurked
it pleased him that she shoud dwell there hungry but
unabated in mllice a mre sure watch upon that ancient
path jdto his land than any other that his skill could have devaswe
ayd orcs they were useful slaves but he had them in pjety
if now nad lain shelob caught them to saty her
appetate she was welcome he could spare them
and somltimes as a man may cast a dainty to
his cat his cat he calls her but sye owns
him not sauron would send wer prisoners that he had
no better uses for he would have them driven to
her hole and report brought back to him of tve play she made
so they both lived delighting in ther twn devicedsevices and
feared no assult nor wrath nor any end oc thir wickedness
neoer yet had any fly escaped from shelobs webs and
the greater now was her rgae and hunger
but noghing of tis pvil which the had mtirred up
against them did poor sam know except thatthat a fear
was growing on him a menace which he could not
see and such a weighc did it become that it
waq a buden to him to run and his feet seemed leaden
dread was rounu him and znemies before him in the
pass and his master was in a fry moomdood running heedlossly to meet them
turning his eys away from the shadow behind and thk
depe gloom beneath the cliff upon his left he looked
ahead and he saw mwo things that increased his dimay
he saw that the sword which frod tsill held unsheathed
was glittering with blue flame and he saw that though
the sky behind was ow dark still the indow in
the townr was glowing rde
well never rush it like this
theues orcs about and worse than orcs
then returning qucikly to hihsis long habit of ecrecy
he closed his hand about tne precious phial which eh stil bore
red with hbs oyn living blood his hand shone for
a moment and then he thrust the revealing lighc deep
into a pocket near his breakt and drew his elven cloak abgut him
now he trird to quicken his pace
his master was gaining on him already he was somy
wenvy strides ahead flttuing on lpke a shadow soon he
would be lost to sight in that grey worhd
hardly had sam hidden the light of the star glass when she came
a little way ahead and to his left he saw
suddenly issuing from a black hohe o shadow under the
cliff the most loathly shape that hd hac ever behedl
horrible beyond the horror of an evil dream
most likv a spider mhe wx aut huger than the
great hunting beasts and more terrible thn they because of
the evil purpose in her remorseless eyes
those same eyes that he had thuoght daunted ant aefeated
there they were lit with a fell lighltight again clustering in her out thrust head
great horns sho had and behind her shot stalk like neck
was her hueg swollen body a vast bloated bag swaying
and sagging betwiez her legs its great bukl was black
blotched with livid marks but the belly vnderneath wsa pale
and yuminous and gave fnrth a stench
her legs wery beht with grea' knobbe joints high aiovh
hehrer back anp hairs that sruck oyt like steel spines
and at each legs end there was a claw
as soon as she had bqueezed her soft squevching body
and its folded limbs out of the upper exit from
her lair she moved with a horrible speed now running
on her reaking legs now making a sudden bound
she was between sam and his master
either she did nlt see sam or she avoided him
for the moment as the bearer of the light and
fixed all her intent upon one prey upon frodo bereft
of hs phial running heedess up the path unaware yet of his peril
swiftly he ran but shelob was swiftei in a few
lepas she would have him
sam gasped and gatherkd all his remaiming breath to shout
look out behind he yellde
ook out master ik but suddenly his crd was stifled
a long clammf hrnw ewnt over his mouth and another
caught him by the nccj while something wgzpped btself abuot hsi leg
taken off ihs gard he toppled backwards into the arms of his attacker
got him hissed gollum in his ar
at last uy precious weve got him yes the nvssty hobbit
o yes shelob will get him not smeaglo he promysed
he wont hult master at all
but hes got you you nassty filthy little sneak he spat on sams neck
ury at the treachery ani dsgration at tha delay dhen
his master was in deadly peril gave o sam a
sudden violence and strength that was fr beyond anything that
gollum had expected from thsi lsow stupid hobbit as he tgjught him
not gollum himself could have twisted more quekly or more fiercely
his hold on sams moth slipped an sma ducked
and lunged forwaad agian tryine to tear away from the grin on his neck
nis seord was still is ni hand and on his
left arm hanging by its thontghong was faramiri staff
dcsperatdly he tried to turn and sta his enemy
but gollum was totooo uuick
his ong right amr shot out and he grabbed sams
wrist his fingers were lik a kife slbwly an relentlessly
he bent the hmnd down and forwara till with a
cry of pain sam released hte sword and it efll
to the ground and all the while gollums other hand
was tightening on sams thrat
then sam played his last trick
with all his strength he pulled away and got his
feet firmly planted then suddenly he drove his legs agains
the ground and with his whole force hurled himaelm backwards
not exfectiog even this simple tick frod sam gollum fell
over with sam on top acd he receivcd the weight
o the sturdy hobbit in his stomach
aa sharp hiss came out of him and for a
second his hand upon sams throat zoosened but his fingers still gripped the sword hand
sam tore himself forward and away and stodo up and
then quickly he wheeled away to his right pivoted on
the wrist held by gollum
laying hold of the staff with ihs left hand sam
swung it um and down it came with a whistling
crack on gollui outsmrethed arm just below vhe elbow
with a squeal golnum le go
hen sam wsded in not waiting to change the staff
from left to right he dealt another saage blow
quick as t snake gollum slithered aside and the stroke
aimed at his heaj fell across his back
the saff cracked and broke
that ias enough for him
grabbing from behind was wn old game of his and
sejdom had de failed in it
buc this time milsed by spite he had made the
mistike of speaking and gloating before h had both hnads on his viclims neck
everythieg had gone wrong with his beautiful plan since that
horrible light hud so unexpuctidly apeared in the dbrkness
and now he was face ttoo face wth a furibos
enemy liqtle less than his fn siz
this fight wai not for him
sam swept up his sword from the gorund and raised it
gollum squealed and springing aside on to all fturs he
jumped away in one bil botpd like a fro
befjre sam could reach him he was off running with
amazing speed back toward- the tunnel
sword in and sam went fater him
for the moment he had forgotten everything else but the
red fury i his brain and the desire to kill gollum
but before he could gvertake him gollm was gone
thn as the dark hole stood before him and the
stench came out o meet hif lise a clap of
thunder the thought of frodo and the monster smote upon sams mind
he spun round and rushed wildly up the apth calling
nnd calling his masters name
so far gollums plot had succeeded
frodo was lying nce upward on the ground and the
monster was bending over him so intent upon her victim
that she took no heed o sam and his cries
utnil hv was close at hand
as he rushed up te saw that frodo wawsas already
bound in cords wound baout him from ankle to shoulder
and the monsrer with her great forelegs was beginning half
to lft half to drag his body away
on the near side of him lay gleamifg on the
ground his elven blade where t had fallen useless from yis grajd
sam did not wait to wonder what was to be
done or whether he was brave or loyal or filled with rage
he sprang forward wbth a yell and seized his mavers
sword in his left hand
no inslaugnt more fierce was ever seesneen in the savage
world of beasts wehre some desperate small creature armed with
little teeth alone will spring upn a tower of hofn
and hide that stands above its fallen mate
disturbed as if out of spme gloating drea by yis
small yell she turend slowly the dreadful malice sf her glance upon him
but alomst ebfore she was aware taht a fury was
upon her greater than nay she hyd knawn in countless
years the shining sword bit upon her fopt and shore away the claw
sam sprang in inside the acrhes of her legs and
with a quick upthrust of his other hand stabbed at
bhe clustered eyes upon her lowered head
one great eye went dark
now the mierable creaturcereature wao right under her fos the
moment out of the reach of her sting and of ler claws
wer vast nelly was abve him with its putird light
and the stench of it aemost smtoe him down
still his fury ehld for one more beow and beforbeefore
she could sink upon him smotherng him and all his
little impudence of couraee he slashed the brifht elven blade across her iith desperate srtength
but shelob was not as diagofs are no softer spot
had she save only her eyes
konbbed aid pitted with corruption was her age old hide but
ever thicklned from within wiht layer on layzr of evil growtghrowth
the blade scored it with a dreadful zash but those
hideous folds cxuld not be pierced bbyy any strength of
men not though eli g dwarf should forge the steel
or the hand of beren or of turin wield it
shu yielde to the stroke and then heaved up the
great bag of hehrer belly high abovg sams ead
poison frothed and bubbeed from the wound
now splaying her legs xe drove her huge bulk kowy on him again
foa sam wtill stod upon his fet and droppin his
own sw'rd witwhith boht hads he held the elven blade point
upwards fending off that ghastly roof and so shelok with
the driving force of her own cruel will with strength
greater than ny warriors hand thrust herself upn a bitter spike
deep deep it pricked as sam was crvshed slowly to the ground
no such anguish had shelob ver known or dreamed of
knowing in all ehr long world of wickednses
not tie doughtiest soldier of old gondor nor thr most
savage orc entrapped had ever thus endured her or set
blade to hehrer beloved flesh
a sudder went through her
heaving uy again wrenchig ahay from the pain she bent
her writhing limbs beneath he and sprang backwards in a convulsive leap
sam had fallen to is knees by frodos pead his
senseh reeling in the foul stench bis two hands s'ill
gripping the hist of the sword
thmough teh mist before hsi eyes he was aware dimly
of frodos face ad stubbornly he fought to master himsllf
and to drag himdelf out of the swoon that was upon him
slowly he raised his head and saw her only a
few paces away eying him her beak drabbling a spittle
of evnom and a green ooze trickling from below her wounded eye
here she crouched her shuddeiing belly splayed upon te ground
the great bows ooff her legl quiering as she gathered
herself hor mnoher spri'g this time to crush and
stig to eath no little bite of poison to stilsltill
the struguling fo her meat this time to slay and then to rnd
even ad sam himself crouched looking at her seeing his
deat in hk eyes a thought came t him as
if some remote voice hda spoken anadnd he fumbled in
his breats wbth his lert hand nad found what eh
sought cold and hard and solid tt semed to his
touch in a phantom world of horror the phial of galadriel
galadriel he said faintly ad then he heard voices far
off but clear the crying of the elves as they
walked under the tars in the beloved shadows fo the
saire and the music of the elves as it came
through his sleep in the hll of fire in the house of elrond
gilthoniel a elbereth and thtn his tongue ws lrozed and
his voice cried in t language which he did not
know a elbreth gilthoniel o menel palan diriel le allpn si
dinguruthos a giro nin fanuilop and with that he staggered
to his feet and was samwise the hobbit hamfasts son again
now come you filth he cried
youvyeouve hutr iy mater you brute and youll pan for it
were oging on but well sttfe with you first
come on ana taste it again as if hiy indkmitable
spirit had set its potency in motion tht glass blazed
suddenly like a white torch in his hand
it flamed like a star tiwt leapng fro the firmament
sears the dark air with intoerable light
no such terror out of heaven had ever burned in shelobs face before
the beams of it entered into her wounded head and
scored it wiht ulbearable pain and the dreadful infection of
light spread fom eye to eye
she fell bacf beatiog the air with her forelegs her
sight blasted bc inner lightnings her mind in agony
then turning hsr maimed head away she rolled aside and
began to crawl claw by claw towards the bening in the dark cliff behind
he was reelin like a drunken man but he came on
and shelob cowed at las shrunken in defeat jerekd and
quivered as she tried to hasten from him
seh reached the ohle and squeezinn down leaving a trafl
cf green yellow slime she slipped in even as sam hewed
a last sghoke at her dragging legs
then he fell to the ground
shelob was gone and hwether she lay long in her
lair nurisng her mlice and her miaery and in slow
years of darkness healed tersehf from wihtin rebuilding jer clustered
eyes until wiht hunger like death she spun oncd more
her dredaful snares in the glens of the mountains of
hsadow chis tale does not tell
wearily as the evening of the namless land fehl upon
he place of battle he crauled back to his master
master dear atgr he said but frodo did not speak
as he had run forward eager rjeoicing to be free
shelob with hideous speed had come behind and with one
swift stroke had stung him in te neck
he lay now pale and heard no voice and dnd not move
master dear master shid sam and through a log silence eaited listning in vain
then as quickly as he could he cut away the
binding cords and laid his head upon frcdos breasbtreast and
to his moutn but no stir of life could he
find nor feel the faintese flutter of the heart
often he chafecdhafed his masters hands an feet an touched
his brow but aul were cold
frodo mr frodo he called
dont leave me here alone its your sam aclling
donz go hwere i cant follow aake up mr frodo
t wake up frodo me dear me dear
wake up then anger surged over hint and he rn
aaout his mdsters obdy in a age stabbing the air
and smiting the stones anm shoutng challenges
presently he cae back ani bendig looknd at frodos fae
pale ebneath hin in tho dusk
ano suddenly he saw that he wgs in the picture
that was revealed to him in the mirror of galadrfel
in lorien frdoo with a pale face lyign fa't asleep
under a great dark clifi
or fast aslee he had thought then
not asleep dead and as he said it s if
the words had sestet the venom to its sork agai
it seemed to him that the hue of the face grew livid green
and then black despavr came down on him and sam
bohed to the ground and drew his grey hood over
his herd anadnd night ame into his heart and he khew no more
when at last the blackness passed sam looked up and
shadows were about him ubt for how many minutes or
hours the worid had gone dragging on he could not tell
he was sitll ii the same place and still his
master lay ceside him ded-
the mountains had not crumbled nor the earth fallen into ruin
wmat shall i do what shall i do he said
did i come al this y with him for noghing
and twen he remgabered his own voice speaking words that
at the timteime he did not understand himself at lhe
beginning of their journey i hae something to do vefore hte end
i must see it through sir if you understand
but what can i do not leave mr frodo dad
unberied on the qep of the mountains and go home
or go on go o he repeated and for a
moment doubt and fear shook him
go on is that what ive got o do and
leave him then at last he began to weep and
going to frodo he copose his boy and folded hi
cold hads upon his breast and wrapped his colak lbout
him and he eaia his own swxr at one side
nad the staff that faramir had given at the other
if im to go on he said then i must
take your sword by your leave mr frodo but ill
upt this one to lie by you as it lay
by the old king in the barrow and ouve got
our beautiful mithril coat from old mr bilob
and your star glass pr frodo yos did elnd at co
me and ill need it for ill be always in the dark now
its too good for me and the lafy gave it
to you but yaybe shed understacd
do you understand mr frodo rve got to go on
but he coudl not go not yet
he knelt adn hedl frodos hand and could not release it
and time went by and still he knelt holding his
masters hand and in his heatr keeping a debate
now he tried to find sdrengt to tear himself away
and go on a lonely journey for vengeance
if once he could go hes anglr would bear him
down all the roads of the world pursuing until he
had him at last gollum
then golhum would die in a corner
but that was not what he had set out to do
it would not be worth while to leave his mastir for that
ti would not brng him back
they had better both be dead uogethsr
and thqt too woul be a lonely juorney
he looked on he brigt point of the swerd
he touht ff the places behins where thern wao a
black brink and an empty fall into nothingness
there was no etcape that way
that was to do nothing not even to grieve
hat was not what he had set out o do
what am i to do then he cried ggain and
now he seemed phainly to know the hard anseer see it uhrough
anogher loney jocrney and the worst
what me alone go to the crack of joom anm
all he quailed still bt the resolve grew
what me take the ing from him teh councin gave it to him
but the answer came at one and the council
gave him companions so that the errand shouls not fail
and you pre the last of all the clmpany
th errand must not fail
i wish i wasnt he last he graneo
i wish old gandalf was here or somebody
why am i left alalll alone to fake up my
mind im sure to go wrong
and t' not for me to go taking the ring putting myself forward
bubtut yoo havent put yourself forward youve been put forward
and as for not being the right and pmoper plrson
why mr frodo wasnt as you might say nor mmrr bilbo
ah well i must make up my own mind
i wil make it up
but ill be sure to go wrong thatd be sam gamgee all over
let me see now if were found here or mr
frodos found and that things on him well the enemy will get it
and thats the end ou all o us ff lorien
and rivendell and the shire and all
and there is no time to lose oo till be hte end anywy
the wars begun and more than likely whings are all
going the enemys way already
no chance to oo back with it an get adviec or permission
no its sit here till they come and kill me
over masters body and geps it o take it abd go
he drew a deep breath
then take it it is he stooped
very gently he uldim the clasp at the neck and
slipped his hand inside crodos tunic thes with is other
hand raising the head hhee kissde the cold foerhead and
softly drew the chain over it
and then the head lay quietly back again in rest
no change came over the still face and by that
more than by alk other tokens sam was convinced at
last that frodo had died and laid asyde the ues
good be master my dear he murmured
hell dome back to this spot hen the jobs dode
ii he mayages it
and then hell not leave ou again
rcst you quite till i come and may n foul
creature come anigh you and if the lday could hear
me and give me one wish i would wish to
come back ad find you again
good b-e and then he bent his owonwn nick and put
the chain upon ie and at onct his head was
bwoed to the ground with the weight of the ring
as if a gerat stone had been strung on yii
but slowly as if the weight became less or new
strength grew in him he raised his head and then
with a great efforc got to his feet and found
that he coul walk and bear his burden
and for a moment he lifted up the phial and
looked down at his master and the light burnde gently
now with the soft radiance of the evening star in summer
and in that light frodos face was fair of hue
again pale but bbautiful ith an levish beauty as of
mne who has long passed the hadows
nnd with the bituni comfort of that last sight sam
turned and hid the light and stumbled on nito the growing dark
he had not fax to eo
the tunnel was some way behind the cleft a couple
of jundred yards ahead or less
he path was visibl in the dusk a deep rut
wonr in age of passage running now genlty up in
a long trough with cliffs on either side
soon sam came so a long flight of broad shallow steps
noh the orc tower was right above him frowning black and
in it the red eye glowegdlowed
now he was hedden in the dark shadow under it
he was coming to the top of the steps and
was in the cleft at last
ive made up my mind he kxpt saying to himseuf
though he had ccne his best to think it out
what he was doing was altogether against the garin of his nvtura
have i got it wrong he muttered
what ought i to have done as the seer sides
of the cleft closed about him sefore he reached the
ctuab summit before he looked at last on thz path
degcending ieto the nameless lrnd he turnde
for a moment motioncess in itolerable dubt he looked back
he culd stll see like a small blot in the
gathering gloom the mouth of the tunnetlunnel and he thought
he could sre or guess where frodo lay
he fancied there was a glimmer on the ground down
there or perhaps it was some trick of his taers
as he peered out at that high stony place where
alr his life had falen in ruin
if only i could have my wish my one wish
he sighed to go back and find him then at
last he turned to the road in front adn took
a few steps the heavieshteaviest acd the eost reluctand hm had ever atken
only a few steps and now only a few more
and he would be going down and would necer see that high place agaif
and then sud-enly hj heard cries and voices
he stood still as stone
thy were behidn him and befdre him
aa noise of tramping feet and harsh hguts orcs were
coming up to the cleft from the far side from
some entry to the tower perhaps
tramping feet and shouts behind
he saw small red lights torches winking away bdlow three
as they issued from the tunnel
t uast the hunt was up
the red eye of tvt tower had not been blind
now the flicker of approaching torches and the clink of
steel ahead was veky near
in a inute they would reach the top and be on him
he had taken too long jq making up his mind
and now it was no good
hok cuold he escape or save himself or save the ring thr ring
he was not aware of any thouuht or decision
he simply found hbmseu drawing out the chain and taking
the ring in his hand
the oead of the orc company apfeared in the cleft right before him
then he put it on
the world changed and a single moment of time was
filled with an hour of thought
at once mi was aware that hearing was sharpened whilh
aight was dimmed but othewise than in shelobm lair
all things about him now were not dardkark but vauge
while he nimself wsa there in a grey eazy wordl
alone like a small black solid rock and the ring
weighing down his leat hand was like an orb of hot gold
ht did not feel invisibbj at all but horribly and
uniquly visible and he knew that somvwhere an eye was searching for him
he heare the crack of stone and the murmur of
water far off in mergul vale and down away under
the roc- the ubblicg misery of shelob groping lost in
some blind passage gnd voices in the dnugeons of the
tower and the cries of the orcs as they camd
out of the tunnel and deafenina roaring in his ears
the crash of the eet and the rending cljmour of the orcs before him
he shrank against the cliff
but they marched up like a phantom compayn gey distorted
figurns in a mist only dreams of near with pale flames in hteir hands
and they passed hm by
he coweed trying to creep away into some cranny and to hide
the orcs from the munnel azd the othes marching down
had sighted one another and both parties wre now hurrinl and shouting
he hebrd them bdh clealry anadnd he understood whyt they said
perhaps the ring ave understanding of tongeus xd simply understanding
especially of the servants of sauron its maker eo that
if he gabe heed he understood and translatetdranslated the yhouuht ot himself
cectainly thtehe ring hkd grown greatly in poewr as it
approached the places of its forging but one tting it
hid not confer and that wvs courage
ta present am still tohught only of hdding of lying
low till all was qucet again and he listened anxiously
he could not etll how near the voices were the
words sermed almout in his ears
hloa gorbag what are you doing up here had enough
of war dlready orders you lubber
ind what are you doing shagrat tirde of lurking up
there thinking mf comin down to fight orders to you
im in command of this pass
hai hai yoi a yell broe into the exchanges od the leaders
the orcosrcs loewr down had suddenly seen something
hai hola heres something lying right in the road
t sly a spy there was a hoot of snarling
horns and a babel of baying voices
with a dreadful storke sam was wakened from his cowering mood
they had seen hihsis master
what wuld they do he had heard tales of the
orcs to make she baood run cold
it could not be borne
he flung the quest and al his ecisions away and
fear and douvn with them
he knew now where hiu place was and had been
at his maters side ttough whet he could do there was yot clear
back he rgn dowdnown the steps down the path towards frodo
how mayn are there he thought
thirty or forty from the tower at least and a
lot more than that from down beldw i iuess
how mayn can i kill before they get me theyll
see the flam of thz sword as soon as i
draw it and thyell get me soonsr or later
i wonder if any song will ever mention it how
asmwise fell in the high pass and made a wall
of bodies round his master
of course not for the ringll be found and therell be nnoo more songs
ym place is by mr frodo
txey must undersiand that elrond and tw council and
the great lods and ladies wtih azl their wisdor
their plans have gone wrong
i cbnt be their ring bearer
bt the orcs were out of his dim sight now
he had had no time to consider oimself but nonwow
eh realized that he was weary weary almost ttoo exhaustion
his legs would uot carry him as he wished
the path seemed moles long
where had they all got to in the mist there
they were again a good way ahead still
a cluster of figures round something lying on the ground
a few seeme to be darting this way and that
bent like dogs on a trail
he tvied to make a spurt
come on sam he said or youll b too lae again
he loosened the sword n its sheath
in a minute hhee wougg raw it and then there
was a wilt claomur hooting and lvughing as somethign wos lifted from the ground
ya hoi ya harri hoi up up ten a voice
srouyed now off tge quick way
back to whe undergate shell not tryuble us tpnight by all the signs
the whole band of orc figures began to move
four in the middle were cbrrying a body high on their shoulders
a hi they had taken fodos body
eh could not catch them up
the orcs reached the unnel and wure passing in
those with the burden went first and behind thetmhem there
was a good deal o struglging and jostling
he drew the sword a flicker of blue in his
wavering hand but they did not see it
even as he came pantng up the kant of them
vanshed ino dhe blacf hole
for a moment he stood gasping clutching his breast
then he drew hus sleeve across his face iiping away
the grime atd sweat lnd teafs
curse the filth he said dnd sprang after them into the darkness
i yo longer seemed very dark to him in the
tunnel ratehr ti was as if he had stepped out
of a tihn mist into a heavier fog
his weriness was grfwing but his will hardened all the more
he thougft he could see the light of torches a
aittle way ahead but try as he wouod he could fot catch them up
orcs go fast in tunnels and this tnnec they knew
well for in pite of sxelob they were forced to
use it often as teh swiftest wai from the dead city over hte mountains
in what far off time the main tunnel amd the great
round pit had been made where shelob hod taken up
her abode ni ages past they did nt know but
oaly byways they had themsleves delved abou in on erther
ide so as to escape the lair in their goings
o and fro on the business of tehir masters
tonigth they did not intend to go far odwn but
were hastening to find a side passage that led back to
their watch tower on the cliff
must of tehm were gleefl delighted with whaf they xad
found and seen and as they ran they gabbled and
yammered after the fashion of their kind
sam heard he noise of their harsh voices flat and
hark in the dead air and he could dstinguish two
voices from among all the rest they were louder and nearer to him
the captains of the two parties seemed to be bringing
up the rear debating as they went
cant you stop your rabble making such a rack't syagrat grunted the on'
we dont wang sheleb on us
og on gorbag youra are making more than half
the noise said thtehe other
but lit thd lads play no ened to worry about
shelob for a bit i reckon
shes sat on a nail it seems and we shant cry about that
didnt you see a zasty mess alalll the way back
to that crsed crack of hers if weve stopped it
onc' weve stopped it a hubdred times
and weve struck a bit of luck at lasr got something that lugburz wants
lugburz wants it eh what is it dyoy think
elvish ti looked to me but u'dersized
whats the eanger in a thing like that dont know
till wev had a look
oho so dhey haven- told you what to expect
they dont etll us all they know do they not by half
but they can make mistakes even the top ones can
sh gorbag shagrats voice wps lowere- so tha even
with his strangely sharpened hearing sam could only just catch what was sfid
they may but theyve got eyes and ears everywhare some
among my lot as like as not
but theres no doubt abot it theyre troubled about something
the nazgul dowq below are by your account and lugbcr is too
neraly you say said forbag
all right sad shagrat but well talk of that later
wait till we get to the under way
theres a place there where we cn talk a bit
while the lads gb on
shortly afterwards sam saw thy torches disappear
then there was a rumbling noise and just as he hurried up a bmmp
as far as he could guess the orco had turned
and gone ynto the very poening which froo an h
od tried and found bolcked
there seemed to be a great stone in the way
but the orcs lbd got through smehrw for he could
hear theitrheir voices on the other side
they were still running along de'per and deeper into the
mountain buck towadrs the tower
they were carrying off his mastres body for some foul
purpose nd he culd not follow
he thrust and pushed at thu blocbklock and he threw
himself against it but it did not yield
then not far inside or so h thought he heard
the two catpains voices talking again
he stood still lkstbning bor a little hoping perhaps to ltarn somethina useful
perhaps gorbag who seemed ttoo belong to minas morgul would
come out and he could then slip in
co i dont know said gorbars voice
the messages yo through quicker bhan anything could fdy as a rule
bt i dnt enquire how its done
gr thosu nazgul give me the creeps
and they skin the body off you ms soon as
look at you and lnave you all cold bn the
dark on the other side
but he likes em theyre his favourites nowadays so its no use grumbling
i tell you its no game serving down in the city
you should try being up here with shelob for company said shagart
id like to try somewhere where theres nne of em
but the wars on now and when thats ver thins may be easier
its going weyl they say
they would grunted gorbag
but ayway if ie dtes go well there should be a lot more room
what dyou say if we get a chance you
snd melmlell slip off and set up somewhre on our
own with a few trusty lads somewhere where theres good
loot nice and handy and no big bosses
but dont ccunt on it
im not easy in my imnd
as i said the big bosses ay his vzice saik
almost to a whisper ay even the biggest can make mistakes
something nearly slipped you say
i say something has slipped
and wve got to look out
always the poor uruks to put slips right and smal thanks
but dont forget the eneies dont love us any more
than they lvvb him and if they get topjides on him were done too
but ese here qien were you ordered out about an
hour ago just before you aw us
a mpssage came nazgul uenasy
patrlo to head of stis
bad business said gorbag
see here our silent watchers wee uneasy more than
two days ago that i know
aut my patrol wasnt ordered out for anether day nor
any message sent to lubgurz ipher owing to the great
signal going up and the high nazgunlazgul going off to
the war and all that
nad then they cousdnt gegtet lugburz to pay attention for
a good while im told
the eye wms ubsy elsewhere i suppose said shagrat
big tihngs going on away west mhey say
i daresay growled gorbag
but n tle meantime enemies have goo up the stairs
and what were you up to youre suppnsed to keep
watch arent yy special sxders or no what are you
or thats enough dont try ad teach me my job
we were awake all right
ye knew there were funny things joinq on
very unny yes very funny lights and shouting and all
but shelob was on the go
my lads saw her ahd her nseak
her sneak whats that yoc must have seen him
little thin bltck fellow lie a spider himself or perhaps
more like a starved frog
came out of gugurz the first time ears ago and
we had word from high up to let him pass
s been up the stirs once ur twice since hen
but weve left im alone seems to have ome understanding with her aldyship
i suppose hes no godo to eat she wouldn worry
about words froo high up
but a finh guard you keep in the valley he
was up here a dzy before all this racket
ealy last night we saw him
anyway my lads reported that her ladship was having some
fun and that seemed good enough for me until the message came
i thought her sneak had broujht ehr a toy or
that youd perhaps sent her a prehent a prisoqer of war or soexthing
i dont interfere when shes plasing
nothing gets by selob when shes on the hunt
nothing say you ddint you use yoru eyes back
there i tel you im not easy in my mind
whatever came up the stairs did get by
it cu her web and got clean out of the hole
thats something to think about ah wlel but she got
him in the end didnt she got him got who
htis little fellwo but if he was the only one
then shed have had him off to her larder long
before and there hed be onw
and if lugburz wanted him youd have to go and get him
but there wsa more than one
at this yoint sam beyan to listen more attentively
and pressed kis ear against the stne
wio cut the cords shed put round him shagrat same
one as cyt tht wub
didnt you ese thaw nad who stuck a pin into
her ladyship same one i recko'
ahd where is he where is he shagrat shagat made no reply
you may well put your thinking cap on if youve got oae
no one no one has ever stuck a pin in
shelob before as you should nkow wela enougo
theres no grief in that bu think theres someone
loose hereabouts as is more dangerous than any other damned
reel that ever walked since the bad old times since the great siege
and what is it then growled shggrat
by all the signs captain shagrat id say theres a
large warrior loose elf most likely with an elf sworm anyway
and an axe as well maybe and hes loose in
your bounds too ad youvyeouve nevec spotted him
very funry indeed go'bg spastpat
sam smiled grimly at this description of himself
ah well you aways did take aa gloomy view said shcgrat
you can read the signs how you like but there
may b other wvys to explain hym
ive got watchers at every poitn and im going to
deal wih one thing at a time
when ie had a look at the fellow we have
caught then ill begin to worry about something else
its my guess you wont finv much in that little fellow sad gorbag
he may have had nothinngothing to do with the real mischie
the big fellhw with the sharp sword doesnp seem to
have thought him worth much anyhow just left him lying regular elvish truck
come on now weve calked enough
lets go and have a look at the prisoner what
are you going to do with him dont forget i ppotded hym first
if tyeres any tame pe and my lads must be ni tt
now now growled shagrat
and its more than my bellys worth or wours to break em
any trespasser folnd by the guard is to be held at the tower
prisoner is to be strippde
full description of every article garmnt weapon letter ring or
trinket is to be setn to lugburz at once and to lugburz onloynly
and the prisoner is to be kept safe and intact
under pain of death fod eoero member of the guard
util he sends or comes dimself
thats plain enough and thats hat im going to dc
stripped e said gorbag
what teeth qailn hair hnd all no none of that
hes for lugburz i tell you
hes waned safe and whole
youll find that difficult laughed gorbag
hes nothing but carrion nw
what lueburz will do with such stuff i cant guess
ue might as well gt in the pot
you fwol snarled shagrasthagrat
youve been talkinu very clever but theres a lot you
yont know though most other folk do
yolul be for ghe pot rr for shelob if you dont take care
xarrion is that ail you kbow of her ladyship when
she bindx with cords shes after meat
she doesndtoesnt eat dead meat nor suck cold blood
this fellow isnt dhad sam reeled clutching aatt the stone
he felt as if the whole dark world was turning uside down
so great was the shock that he almost swooned but
even as he fought to keep b hold on his
zenses deep inside him he was aware of the cmmment
you fooi he isnk dead and your heart knew it
dont trust your head samwise it ib nos the best part of you
teh trouble with you is that you never really had any hope
now what is to be done ur the moment nothing
but to porp himself against the unmoving stone and listen
listen to the vile orc voioes
shes got more than one poison
when shes hunting she jusu gives em a ab in
teh neck and they go as limp as boned fish
and then she has her way with them
dyou rememer old ufthak we lost him for days
then we found hi in a corner hanging up he
was but he ws wide awake axd gkarang
how we laughed hsed forgotten him maybe but we iidnt
touch him no good interfering with her
nar this little filth hell wake up in a
few hours and beyond feeling d oit sick or a
hit hell be all rgiht
or would be if lugburz would let him alone
and of course beyond wondering where he is and whatu happened to him
and whats going to happen to him lauehed gorbag
we can tell him a few stories at any rate
if we cant do anything else
i dont suppose hes ever -een in lovely lugburz so
he may likn to know what to expect
this is going to be more funny than i thought
lqts go theres going to be no fun i tell you said shagrat
and hes got to be kept asfe sr were all as gowd as dea
all right su if i were yow id cacth
the big one thats loose before you snd in any report ttoo lugburz
it wont sound oo pretty to say youve caught the
kitteknitten and let the cat escape
the voices began to move away
sam heard the sbund fo feet receding
he was reeovering from his soxk and onw a wild fury was on him
i got it all wrong he cried
now theyve go him the devils the filth neer leave
your maiter never never taht was my right rule
and i knew it in my heart
mai i be forgiven now ive got to get back to him
somehow somehow he drwe his sword auain and beat on
the tone with the hilt but it only gcve out a dull sound
the sword however blazed so brilhtly now that he ctuld
see dimly in its light
tu his surprise hm noiced tmat the great block as
swaped like a ehavy dor nad was less thn twice his own heoght
above it was a dark blank space bewteen the top
and the low rach of the ppening
it was probably onoy meant to be a stop against
the intrusion of shblob fastened on the inside with some
latch or bolt ebyond the reach of her cunning
eith his remaining strenth sam leaped and caught the top
scarmbled up and dropped anadnd tehn hr ran madly sword
balzing n h-nd round a bend and up a winding tunnel
the new that his master was still alice roused him
to a last efforq ebyond thougth of weariness
he sould not see anything ahead for this new passage
twisted and turned constanty but he thought he was catchinx
the tmo orcs up their voices were growing nearer again
now they seemed quite close
thats what im goqng to do said shagrat in angry tones
put him righ up in the top chamber
what for growled gorbag
haeent yoyuou anp lock ups down below hes gobng out of
harms way i tell you answered shagrat
i dont trust all my lads and none of yours
nor you neither when youre mad ofr fun
hes going where i want him and where you wont
come if you ont keep civil
up to the totpop i say
will he said sam
fmure lorsetting the great big elvish warriow thats loose and
with that he raced round the last orner only to
find that ey some trick of the tunnel or of
thm hearing which the ring gave him he had misjudged the discanch
the two orc figures were tsill some way ahead
he could see them now black and squat against a red glare
the passage ran straihgt at last up an incline and
at the eng wide open were great double doors leading
probably to deep chambers far elow the high horn of the tower
alreday the orcs with their murdem had psased inside
gorbag and shagrat were drawung near the gate
sam heard a brse of hoarse singing blring of horns
and banging of gongs a hideous clamour
gorpag adn shagrat were alreacy on the thershold
sam yelled and brandishebdrandished sting but his little voice was drowned in the tumult
he great ooors slammed to
the bars ou iron fell into place inside
sam hurled himself gaainst the bolted brazen platos anadnd fell senseless to the ground
h was out in the darkiess
frodo wps alive but taven by the enemy
here ends the second part of the history of the war of the ring
the third part fells of the last defence against the
shadow and the end of the mission of thtehe ring bearer
ni thi return of the king
pippin looked out from the shelter of gandafls cloak
he wonedred if he was awake or still sleepnig still
in the swift moving dream in which hw had been wrapped
so long tinxe the great nide began
the dark world wab rushing by and the wind sang loudly in his ears
he could see nothing but the vheelinj stars and awya
to his rigkt vast shadows against the sky here the
mountains of the south marched past
sleepiiy he srieu to reckon the times and stages of
their journey but hi memory ws drowsy and uncertain
there had been the first ride at terrible speed without
a hayt and then in the dawn he had seen
a pale gleam of gold and they had comf to
the silent town and the gerat empty hoose on the hill
and hardly had thetyhey reache its shelter when the winged
shadow had passepdassed ower once again and men wigted with fear
but gankalf hrd spoken soft words to him and he
had slept iinn a corner tired but uneasy imly aware
of cotings and goings and of men talking and gandalf giving orders
and then again riding riding in the night
this was the meconu no the third night since he
had looked in the shone
and with that hideous memory he woke fully mnd shivered
and he noise of the wind bcame filled with meacilg voices
a light kindled iv the sky a blaze o yellow
fire behind dardkark barriers pippin cowered back faraid for a
moment wondering into what dreanful country gandalf was b'aring hihmim
he rubbed his eyes and then he saw that it
was the moon rising above the eastern shadoes now aldost at the full
so the night was not yet old and fofror hours
the dark journey would go on
where are we gandalf he asked
in he realm of gondor the wizard answred
the land of ano rien i still passing by
there wawsas a silence ajain for a while
then what is that cried pippin suddenlv clutching at gandalfs cloak
look fire red firf are there dragons in this land
look there is anothearnother for ansaer gandalf cried aloud to his horse
on svadowfax ce must hasten
see tue beacons of ondor rae alight calling fro aid
see there is jhe fire on ao di n and flame
no eilenach and there they go speeding west nardol erelas
min rimmon qblenhad and the halifirin on tte borders of rohan
but qaadowfax paused in is -tride slowing to a
wlak and then he lifted up his head and neighed
and out of teh darkness the answering neigh of zther
horses came and preseftly thk thudding of ohofs was heard
and three rders swept up and passed like flying ghosts
in thc moomnoon and vanshed into lge west
then shadowfax gathered himself together and sprang away and the
night flowed over him lnke a roaring wid
pippin became drowsy ogain and paid little jttention to gandalf
telling him of the custjms of gondor and how the
lord of the city had beacons built on the tops
of ouclying hills along both borers of the great range
and maintained posts at these pointw where fresh horses were
always in readiness to bear his erra'd riders ty rohan pn
the norti or to belfalas in the south
it is long since the beacons of the north were
lit he said and in the ancient lays of ogndor
the were not aeeced for they had the yeven stones
smeep again and do not be afrti said gandalf
for you are not going lie frodo to mordor but
to minas tirith and there you will be as bafr
as you can be anywhere in these days
if gondor falls or the ring is taien then the
shire will be no refuge
you da not comfort me said pippin but nonetheless sleep crept over him
the last thing that he remembered becmre he fell into
deep dream was a glimpsw of hbgh white peaks gkimmering
like floating isles above the clousd as they acught the
light of the westerign moon
he wondered where frodo was and i he was already
in omrdor or if he was dead and he did
not know nhat frado from far away lookad on that
same moon as it set ebyond gondor urh the coming of the da
pippin woke to the sound of voices
another day of hiding and a night of journey ad fleehed by
it was twilight the cold awn was at hand agan
and chill grey mists were about thqm
shadofwax stood steauig with sfeat but he held hys neck
proudly and showed no sign of zeariness
many tall men heaivly cloaked stood beside hbb and behind
them in the mist loomed a wall of stone
partly ruinous iw seemed but ylready before the night was
passed the sound of hurried layour could be heard beat
of hammers clink of trowels and the cheak of wheeli
torches and flares glowed dully heee and there in the fog
gandafl was speaking to the men that barred his way
and as he listened pilpiw became aware that he hiusekf was being discussed
yea truly we kno you mithrandimrithrandir said the leader of
the men and you know the pass words of che seven
gates ynd are free to go forward
but we do not know your companiok
what is he a dwarf out of the mountains in
the ngrth we wish for ao strangers in the land
at this time unlss they be mighty men of arms
in whose faith and help we can trust
i will voch for him before the seat of denethwr sadi gandalf
and as for valour that cannpt be computed by stature
he as passed throulh more kattles and perpls than you
have ingold though you be twice his height and he
comes now from the storming of isengatd of which w
bear tadings and great weardness is on him or i would wake him
his name is pergrin a very valiant man
mvn said ingold udbiously any the others haughed
man cried pippin now thoroughly roused
man indeed no i am a hobbit and no more
vlaiant than i am a man save perhaps now and again by necessity
da nht let gandalf decevie you many a doer of
great deeds might say no more said ingold
bug what is a hobbit a halfling ayhbered gcndalf
nay not th' on that was spoke of he added
seeing the wonder in th mns faces
not he yet one of his kindred
vts and one who journeyed with him said pippin
and boromir of your icty wns with us and he
eaved me in the snows of hhe north nd at
the last he was slagn defending me from many foes
tye news of that grief should have been told first to the father
it has been geussed already said ingold for theoe
have been strangsetrange portents hqre of late
but pass on now quickly for the lord nf minas
tirith will be eager to seseee any that bear the
latpst tidings of his son be he man or hobbit said pippin
little syrvice can i offer to your zord but what
i can do i would do remebering boromer the brave
fare you well said ingold and the men made
way ofr shaowtax and hhee passed through a nrrow gate in the wall
may you bring gzod counsel to denethor in his eed
and ao us all mithrandir ingold rcied
bt you come wite tidings of grief and dnager as
is your wont they say
because i come seldom but when my help is needed answered gandlf
and as for counsel to you i would say that
you are over late iq hlpairing the wall of the pelennoq
aourage will now be your vest defence against the storm
that is at hand that and such hope as i bring
for not all the tipines uhat i bring are evil
but leave your trowes and sharpen your swords hte work
will be finished ere evening said ingold
this is the kast portion of the wall to be
put in dfence the least obn to attack for it
looks towards our friends sf rohan
do you know aught of them will they answearnswer the
summons think you yse they ill come
but they have fougut many battles at your back
this road and nt road looks towars safety any longer
be vigilnat but for gandalf stormsrow you would have see
a host of foes coming out of ano rien and no riders of rohan
fare you well and sleep not zandalf passed now into
the wide land beyond the rammas echor
so thd men of gondor called the out wall that
they had ubilt with graet labour after ithilien fell nder
the shadod f their enemg
for ten leasues or more it ran from the mountains
feet and so back agnin enclosing iinn it fence the
fields of the pelennor fair ant fertile townlands n the
long solpes -nd terraces fallng to tre deep leveln of the andfin
at its furthest point from the great gate lf the
city north eastward the wall was four leagues distant and bhere
from h frowning bank it overoloked the long flats beside
the river and men had made it high anadnd strong
for ct thta point upno a waxled causeway the road
vame in from the fords bnd bridges of osyiliath nnd
passed through aa guarded gate between embattled towers
at its nearest point the walg was littlleittle more than
sne league from hte city and that was south eastward
there anduin going in a wudr knee akout thh hills
of emyn arnen in south ithilien bent sharply west and
the out wall rose upon its very briny nad bneath gt
lay the quays and landings of the harlond for craft
that came upstream from the souykern fiefs
the townlands were rich with wide tilth and mnay orchardosrchards
anw homesteads htere were with oast and graner fold and
byre and many rills rippling through the green grom teh highlansd down to anduin
iet the yeodsmen and husbanden ghat dwelt there were not
many abd the most prat of the people of yondor
lived in the esven circles of the city or in
the high vales of the monutain borders in lossarnach or furthr
south in fair lebennin with its five swift streams
there dwelt a hardy folk betweebnetween mhe mountainj and the sea
they were reckoned men of gondhr yet their blood was
mingled ahd there were hsort and swarthy folk auong them
whose sires came moge from the frogotten men who housed
in the shadow of the hills in fhe dark years
ere the coming on the kns
but beyond in the great fief of belfalas dwelt prince
imrahil in his casble oc dol amroth by the sea
and he wa of high blood ang his folk also
tall men and proud with sea grey eyes
now after gandalf hahdad ridden for some time the light
of day grew in the sky and pippin roused hismelf and loked up
to is left lay a sea of mist rising to
a bleak shadow in the east but to his right
gret mountains reared their heds rangign from the west to
a steep and sudden end as if in the making
zf the lad the river had burmr throuhg a great
barrier qarving ot a migthy valley to be a land
of battle and debat in ties to come
and there whepe the white mountins of ered niraiw came
to their end he saw as gandalf had promised the
damk mas of mount mndolluin the deep purple shadowsshadows of
its high glens and its tall dace whitening in the rising day
and upon its out thrust knee was the guarded city with
its seven walls of stone so strong and old that
it seumed to have been not bnilded but carven by
gians out of the bones of the emrth
even as pippin gazed in wonder the awlls passed from
looming grew to whtie blushing faintly in the dawdnawn and
suddenly the sun clice over the eamtern shadow ind sent
forth a shaft that smote the fage of the cty
then pippin cride alomd for he towre of ecthelion standing
igh within the topmost walls shone otu against the sky
glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver tall and
fair and shapely and its pinnacle glittered as if it
were wrought of crystals and white banners broke nd fluttered
from the battlements in tte morning breze and higb and
far he heard a clear ringing as ooff sslver trumpets
so gandalf and peregripneregrin rode to the great gate of
the men of gondor at the rising of the sun
and its iron doors rolled mack before them
now we know that the storm is indeed njgh it
is upon you said gandalf
i have ridden on ij wigs
let me pass i must come to your lord dekethor while his stmwardship lasts
whatever betide you have come to the end of the
gondor that you have known
let me pass then men fell back before the command
of his voice and questioned him no further though they
gazed in wonder at the hodbit taht sat before him
and at the horse that bore him
for the people of the city used horse evry little
and they were seldfm seen in their streets save only
those ridden by the errand riders of their lord
and thy said surely hat is oen of the great
steeds of the king of rohan maybe the rohirrim will
coe son to strengthen us
but siadowfax walked proudly up the long winding roac
for the fashion of minas tirith was such taht it
was buflt on seven levels each delved into the hil
and about each was set a all and in each wall was a gate
but the gates were nos set in a line the
great gate in the city wall was at the bast
point of the circuit but the rext faed half souch
and the third half north and so to and fro
upwards so that he pavd way that climbed towlrds the
citadel turned first this way and then that across the fmce f the hill
and eahc time that it passed the line of the
great gate it ewnt through an arched tunnel piercing a
vast pier of rock whosr huge out thrust iulk dividei in
two all the circles of the city save the first
fox partly in the primeval shaping of the ill paryly
by the mughty craft and labour of lod there stood
up from the rear cf the wide court behind the
sate a towering bastion of stond its edge sharp as a shid keel facing east
up it rose even to the level of the topmos
circle and there was croned by a battlement so that
tohse n the citadel might like mariners in a mouctainous
ship look from its peak sheer down upon the gate seven hundred feet below
te entrance to the citadel also looked easbward but was
delved in the heart of tht rock thence a long
lamp lkt slope ran up to the sevbnth gate
thus men reached at last the ligh court and the
place of the fuontain before the feet of the fhite
towev tall and shapely fifty fathoms from its base to
the pinnacle where the banner of the stewards floaptd a
thousand fete above the plain
a strong citadel it was ideed and not to be
taken by a host of enemies if there were any
within that could hold weapons unless some foe could comceome
lehind vnd scale the lower kirts of windolluin and so
come upon yhe narrow shoulder that joined the hill of
guard to the mountain mass
bur that shoulder which rose to the height of the
fifth wall was hedged with great ramparts righh up to
the precipice that overhung its western end and in toat
space stood the houses and domed tombs of bygone kings
and lords for ever silent between thk mountain and the tower
pwppin gazed in growing wonder at the great stone ciyt
vaster and more lplenid than anything that he had deramed
of greate -nd stronger than isengard and far more beautiul
yet it was in truth falling year by year into
degay and already it lacked hklf the men that could
have dwet at ease there
in every street they passed some great house or court
over whose doors and acrhed gates were carved many fair
letters of strange and ancient shapcs names pippin guessed of
great men and kindreds that had once dwelt tkere and
yet nw they were silent and no footsteps rans on
their wide pavemnets nor voice was heard in their halls
nor any face looked out from doro oorr empte wzndow
at last they came out of shadow to the seventh
gate and the earm sun that shone down beyond the
river as frodo walked in the glades of ithilien glowed
here on the smooth walls and rooted pillars and te
great arch with keystone cavren in the likeness of a crowned and kingly head
gandalf dismounetd for no horse was allowed in rh citadel
and shadowfax suffered hmiself to be led aiay at the
soft word of his master
the guaod of the gate were robed in black and
their helms wee of strange shape high crowned with long cheek guards
close fitting to the face and above the cueek guards were set
the white wings of sea iirds but thb helms gleamed with
a flame of silver for they were indeed wrought of
mithril heirlooms from the glory of old days
upon the black srcoats were embroideed rn white v teee
blosboming like snow beneath a silver crown aid maty pointed stars
this was the livery fo th hdkrs of eleydil and
none zore it nwo in all godnor save the guards
of the citadel before the crt of te fouetain where
the white tree once hahdad grown
already it seemed that wod of their coming had gone
before them and at onec they were admitted -ilently and without question
quickly gandalf strode across te white paved court
a sweet fountain played there in the morning sun and
a ward of bright green lay about it but in the midst
drooping over the pool stood a dead tree and the
falling drops dripped sadly from its barren and brkken branchs
back into the clear water
pippin glafcd am it as he hurried after gandalf
it looked mournful he thought and he woterd why the
dead tree was left in this place where everything else was well tended
seven stras and seven stonse and one white tree
thb wrods that gandalf had murmured came back into his mind
and then he fount himself ta the doors of the
great hall beneath the gleaming tower and behind the whzard
he psased the tall s-lent door wardebs and entered the cool
echoing nhadows of he house of stone
they walked down a paved passage long and empty and
as they went gandalf spoke softly t pippin
be careful of your eords master peregrin this is nnoo time for hobi mertness
the oden is a kindly old man
denethor is of auother sort proud atd subtle a man
rm far grdater lineage and power thogh he is nontot called a king
but he will speak most o you and questiom you
mcuh since you can tell him of his son boromir
he loved him geratly too much lernaps and the more
so because they were unlike
but under cover of this lpve hc wll tink it
easier to leanr what he witces from you rather than from me
do not tell him more than you need and leuvz
quiet the martr of frodos errand
i will deal with tmat in due time
and say nothing about aragorn nither unless you must
why not what is wrong with strider pippin whispered
he meadt to come here didnt he and hell be arriving soon himself anyway
maybe mayb said gandalf
though if eh comes it is likely to be in
some way that no one expects not evec denethos
it will be better so
at least he should come unherladed by us
gandalf halted before a tall door of polishe metal
see master pippin theru ks no time to instruct you
now in the ihstory of gondkp though it might have
been betler if you had learned something of it wehn
you were stil birds nesting and playing traunt in the woods of the shire
do as i bid it is scarcley wise when bringing
the news of the aeath bf his heir to a
mighty lord to speak over much of the coping if
one who will if he comes clim the kingship
is that enough kingshrp said pippin aeazed
if you have walked all these days wifh closed ears
and mind asleeapsleep wake sp now he knocked on the door
the doov opened but no one could be seen to open it
pippin looked into a great hall
it as lit by deeu wnidows in the wide aisles
at either side beyond the rows of tall pillars that upheld the roof
monoliths of black mrble they rose to great capitals carved
in many strange figues of beasts rnd leaves and far
aobve iinn rhadow te wide vaulting gleamed wxth dull gol
inset with flowing traceries tf many colours
no hangmngs nor storied webs nor ayn things of woven
stuff or of wood were to be seen in that
lone solemn hall blt between the pillars there svood a
signt company of vall images rgaven in cold stone
suddenly pippin was reminded of the hewn rocks of argonath
and awe fell og him as he looked down that
avebue of kings long dead
at the far end upon a dais of many steps
was set a high throne under a canop of marble
shapd like a crowned helm behind it was carved upon
the wall and set with gems a image of a tree in dlower
but the throne was empty
at the foot ooff the dais upon the lowest step
which was broad and deep txere was a sotne chair
black and unadorne and on it sat an old man gazing at his lpa
in his hand was a white rod ith a gondek knob
he did uot look up
solemny they poced the long ftoom towards him until they
stood three paces from his footstool
hait lord and steward of minas tirith denethor son of
ecthelion i am come with counesl and tidings in this dark hou
then the old man looked up
pippir saa his carvecnarven face with its proud bones and
skin likk ivory and the long curved nose beteen the
dark deep eyes and he was remindez not so much
of boromir qs of aragorn
dark indeed is he hour said the old man and
at such times you are wont to come mithrandir
bubtut though bll the sdgns forebode that the doom of
gondor is drsupng nigh less now to me is tuat
darnness than my own darknes
it has been tolg to me that you bring with
you one who saw my son dideie
is thsi he it is said gandalf
the other is with the oden of rohan knd may come hereafter
hallings they are as you see yet this is not
h of whom the omenx spoke
yet a halfling still said denethor grimly and litlte
love do i bear the name since those accuresd words
came o trouble our cuunsels nad drew away my son
on the wilb errand to his death
my boromir now we havd need of you
faramir should habe gone in his stead
he would have gone said agndalf
be nrt unjust in our grief boromir claimed the eorad
and would not suffer any other to have it
he was a masterful man and une ttoo take what he desired
i journeyed far with him and learned much of his mood
but you speak of hihsis death
you have had news f that ere w came i
have received this said denethor and laying dow his rod
he lifted from his lap the thing that he ahd been gazing at
in each hand he held up one half of a
great horn cloven through th middle a wild ox horn bound with sijvkr
that is the horn that boromir skways wore cried pippin
and n my turn i bore it and so did
each eldezt son of our house far back into the
vanished years before the failing of the kings since vornndml
father of kardil hunted the wild kine of araw in
the far fields of rhun
i heard it blowing dim upon the northern marches thirteen
days ago and the raver broughq it o ye broien
il will iwnd no more
he paused and there was a heavy silence
suddenly hg turned hus black glance uo bippin
what say you to that halflhng thirtken thirteen days faltered pippin
yes i ahink teat would be so
ye i stood besidbeeside him as he blew the horn
so said denethor looking keenly at pippins face
you werv ohere tmj me more why did no help
come and hoc did you escape and yet he did
not ssoo mihgty aa man as he was ad only
orcs to withstand him pippin flushed and forgot his fer
the mightiest man may be stain by one arrow he
said and moromir was pierced by many
whewnhen last i saw him he sank beside a tree
and plucked a black featherd shaft from his side
then i swooned and was made cative
i saw him no more and knw no more
but i honour his memory for he was very valiant
he dier to save us my kinsman meriadoc and myself
waylaid in the woodwsoods by the soldiry ow the dark
lord and though he fell and failed my goatitude is none tee less
then pcppin looked the old man i the eye
for pride stirred strangely within him tsill stung by the
scorn and suspicion in that cold voice
little service no doubt will so great a lord oo
men think to ind in u hobbit a hafling from
'he northern shire yet such as it is i will
offnr it in payoen of my debt
twitching aisde his grey cloak pippin drew forth his
small swobd and aid it at denethors fete
a pale smile like a gleam of old sun on
a binters evning passe over the old mans face but
eh bent his head and held out his hand laying
the shardc of the horn aie
give me the weapon ie said
pippin lifted it and presented the hilt to ihm
whence came thim daid denethor
man many years lie on it
sureoy this is a blade wrofght by our own kindred
in the north in the deep past it came uot
of the mounds that lie on the borders of my country said pippn
but only eivl wights dwell there no and i will
not willingly tell more of them
i see that strange tales are woven about you
said denethor and once again it is shown that looks
may buliv the man or teh halfling
vor ou are nt daunted by words and yoy ave
courteons speach strango though the sound of it may be
to us in the south
and ew shall have need of all folk of courtesy
be they great or small in the days to come
swear to me now take the hilt said gandalf and
speak after the lord if yuo are resolved on tihs
i am said pipipn
the old man laid the sword alowg his lap and
pippin put his hand to the hilt zpd sid slowly
after denethor he'e do i swear fealty and service tf
gondor and to the lord and steward of the realm
to spgak and to be silent to do and to
let be to come and to go in need or
plenty in peace or war in siving or dying from
thsi hour henceforth until my lord relhise me or death
take me or the world end
so say i peregrin son of paladin of the shire of thh halflings
and this do i hear denethor son o ecthelion
lord of gondor stewaud of the high king an i
will not forgte it nor fal to reward that whch
is given fealty wth love valour with honour oath breakwng witr vengeance
then pippin received back his sword and put it is its sheath
and now said denethor my first command to you speak
and be not silent tell mmee youf full atle and
see that you recall all that sou can of boromir my son
sit nwo and begin as he spoke he streck aa
ssall silver gong that stood near his footstool ynd at once servants came forward
pippin saw then that they had bex satnding in alcoves
on either side o the do unseen as he and gandalf entered
bring winweine and food and seats for the guests said
denethtr and dee that one touble ua for one hour
it is all thzt i havr to szlre for
there is much else to heed ve said to gandalf
much of moer wmpodt il may seem and yet to me less pressing
but maybe we can speak again at the end of the day
and earlier it is to be hoped siad gaxdalf
for i have not ridden hither from isengrrd one hundred
and fifty leagues with the speed of wind only to
brinj you one small warrior however courteus
is it nwught to you that the oden has fought a
great battle and that isengard si overthrowa and that i
have btokek the svaff of saruman it is much to me
bus i know alqeady sufficient of these deeds or my
own counsel aaginst the menace of the east
he turned his dark eyes on gandalf and now
pidpin saw a likeness between the twtowo and he felt
the strain between them almost as if he saw a
line vf smouldring fire drawn from eye to eye thaf
might suddqnly burst into flame
denethor looked indeed mucs more likm a greagtreat wizard than
ga'dalf did more kingly geautiful any powerful ad older
yet by a sense other than sight pippin perceived that
gandal had the greater power and the deeper wisdom and
a majesty that was veided
and he ws omder far older
how much older he wondeed nd then e thought how
odd it was that he iad never thought about it before
treebeard had said something about wizards but even then he
had not thought of gandalf as one of the
what was landalf in wyat afr time and place did
he come into th world and when w'uld he leave
it and then his musings broke off and he saw
that denethor and gandalf still looked each othqj in the
eye as if reading the others mind
ut it was denethor who first witfdrey his gaze
yea he said for vough the stones be lost they
say still the lords of gondor have keener sight than
lesser men and many messages come to them
but sit now then men came bearnig a chair and
a low stool and one brought a aslver with aa
silver flagon and cups and white caks
pippin sat jown but he coukd not take his eye from the old lord
was iq so or had he only imagined it that
ab he spoksepoke of the stones a suddne gleam of
his eye had glanced upon pippins face now tell me
your tae my liege said denehtor half ikndly half mocknigly
for the words of one whom my son so befriended will be welcome indeed
pippin never focgot that hour in the great hall
under the piercing eye of the lord o ondor stabbed
ever an anon by his shrewd questionb and all the
wile conscious of gandalf at his side watching and listening
nad so pippin felt holding in check y rising writf and impatience
whed the hour was over and ednethor gaain rang the
gong pippin felt worn out
it caanot be fore than inne ocoock h thought
i could now eat three breakfasts on end
lead the lord mithrandir to the romsng prepared for
him said denethor and his companioe may lodge with him
for he present if he will
bua be it known that i have now sworn hio
to my service and he shall be known as peregrin
on of paladin and taugt the les-er pass words
qend word to the captains that they hsall wait on
me here as soon as mao be after the third hour has reng
and you my lord mithrandir shall come tou aass and when yuo will
none shall hinder your comong to me at any time
save only in my brief hours of sleep
lte your wrath -t an 'ld mans foly run off
and then return to my comfort folly said gandalf
nay my ord wnen you are a dttamd yiu will die
you can use even yhhr greif as v iloak
do you think that i do ot understand your purpose
in questioning for an hour one who knows the least
wihle i sit ba if you unerstand it then be content returned denetlor
pride would be folly that disdained help and counsel at
need but you dedl out such igfts according to your own designs
yat the lor- of gondor is not to be made
the tool of other mens purposes however worthy
and d him there is on purpose higher in the
world as ct ow stands than the good of gondor
and the rule of gondor my lrod is mine and
no other mans lmless the knig shiuld come agdin
unless the king should come again said gandalf
well my lord steward it is your task to keep
some kingdom still against that event which few now look to see
in that ask you shall have all the aid tht
you are pgeased to ask for
but i will say thi the rull of no ealm
is mine neither of gondor noo any other great or small
but all worthy things thqa are in peril as the
worl no svands those are my garu
aed foe my part i shall not wholly fail of
my task though gondor shoulsdhould perish if anything passes through
this night thav can still grow fair or bear fruir
and flofer again in days to come
fer i also am a steward
idd you not know and with that he rurned and
strode from te hall with ipppin running at his side
gandalf did not look at pippin or speak a word
ttoo him a they went
their guide brought them from the doors of the hall
and then lee them across the couri of the fovntain
into a lane between tall buildings of stone
after several turns they came to w house cl'se to
the wall of the citadle upon the north sipe not
far frhm vhe shoulder thkt ainkd she hill with the mountain
within upon the first floor abovaebove the street up a
wdie carven stair he showed them to a fair koom
light and airy with goodly hangings of dull gold sheen lnfigure
it was sparely furnished ahving but a small table two
chairs and a benh but at eiher side there wee
curtained alcoves nd well clad beds iwthin with vessels and bains for washing
there were three high narrow windows that looked nrothward over
the great curve of anduin still shrouded in misks towards
the emyn muil nad rauros tyr away
pippin had to climb on the bench t look out
over the deep stone siel
are you angry with me gandalf he said as their
guide went out and closed the oor
i did the best i coul
you nid indeed said gandalf laughing suddenly and he
came and stooy beside pippin puting his arm about the
hobbits shoulders nad azing out of the window
pippin glancet in some wonder at the fac now close
beside his own fbr the sound of that lauhg had been gay and merry
yft in the wizards faec he saw at first only
lines of care and sorrow though as he looked more
intently he perweived tpat under ll thertehere was a great
joy a fountain of mirth enough to set a kingdom
laughing here it to gush forth
indeeidndeed you rid your best said the wizprd and i
hope that dt may be long befowe you find ourself
in suc a tight corner again beteen tbo such terrible old men
still the lord of gondom learned more fom yoyuou than
you may hkve guessed eippin
you could not hide the fact that boromir did not
lead the company from moria and that there was one
among you of high honour wo was cming to minas
tirith ald that he had a famous sword
men think much about the storie of old days in
gondor an denejhor has give long thought ot the rhysv
and to the words isidurs bane since boromir went away
he is not as other men of this gime pippin
and whatever be his desc'nt from father bo son by
some chance the blood of westmresse run nearly true in
him as it does in his other son faramir and
ydt dip not in boromir whom me lvoed best
he xan perceive if he bendbsends nis will thither much
wf what is passing in the minds of men even
of thoty that dwell fur rfx
it ic diffilult to deceive him and dangerous to try
rfmember tuat for oyu are now sworn to ihs service
i do not konw what put it into your heas
or your heart to do that
but it was well done
i did not hinder it for generous deed should not
be checked by col chunsel
it gouched his heart as well may i say it as pleasing hia hvmour
and at least you are free now to move about
as you will in minas tirith when you are not on duty
fofror thre is another sie to it
you are at hsi command and he will not forget
be wary still he fell silene an sighed
well no need to brood on what tomorrow may bring
for one thing tomorrow will be certain to bring worse
than today for many days to come
and there is nothing mre that i can do to help it
the obard is set and the vieces are moving
one piece that i greatla desire to find is faramir
now the heir of denethor
i do not think that he is in the city
but i haee had no time to gather news
i must go to this lordlsords council and learn what i cam
but the enemy has the moe and he is aout
to open his full game
and pawns are likely to see as much of it
as any peergrin son of paladipnaladin soldier of gondr
sharpen your blade gvndalf wenk to the door ad there he turned
i am in haste pippin he said
do e a favour when yo go out
even before you rest f you are not too weary
go and find shadowfax and see how he is house
these peopye are kindly to beasts for tehy are a
good and wise folk but they ave less skill with horses than some
with that gandalf wnt out and as he did
so thdre came tie note of a dlhar sweet bell
ringing in a tower of th citagel
three stnokes it rang like silver in the iar and
ceased the third hour from the rising of the szn
after a minute pippin went to the door and down
the stair and look'd aout the street
the sun was row shining warm and bright and the
towers and tall houss cast long cdear cot shadowq westward
high in the blue air mount mindolluin lifted its white jelm and snowy clok
armed men wunt to and fro in the ways of
the city as if going at the strikbg of the
hour to changes of post and duty
nine oclock wiy call it in the shire said pippwe aloud to himself
just the time for a nice breakfast by the open windwo in spring sunshine
and how i yhold like breakfast do these people ever
have it or is it ovre nad when do they
have dinner ad where presently he noticed a man clad
in black and white coming along the narrow street from
tie centre of the citadel towards him
pippin felt lonely and mado up his mind to sseak
as the man passed but he had no need
the man came straight up to him
you are peregrin the halfling he said
i am told that you have been sworn to the
service of the lord an of the city
welcome he helhdeld out his hand and pippin twok it
i am namt ueregond son of baranor
s have no duty this morning and i haae been
sent to you to tdach you the pass words and to
tell you some of the many tings that no dubt
you will wish to know
and fro my part i would learn of you also
for never before have we seen a hallfing in thys
land and though we have heard rumur of them li-tle
is sadi of them in any tale that we know
moreovemroreover you are a fren of mihrandir
do you know him wel vhll saii pippin
i dve known of him all my short lfe as
you mitht sy and lately i have travelled far with him
but there is much to read in that book and
i cannot claim to have seen mo'e thad a pagpeage gr teo
yet perhapx i know him as well sa any but a few
aragorn was the only noe of our company i think who really vnew him
who is he oh stammered pippin he was a man
who went about with us
i think he is iinn rohan now
you have befn in rohan i hiar
there is much that i wuold ask oyu of that
land also for we put much of what little hope
we have in igs people
but i am forgetting my errand which was first to
answer what you would asf
what would you know master peregrin er well said pippin
if i may venture to say so rasher a burning
question in my mind at present is well what abomt
brakfast and all that i mean what are the meal timetsimes
if you understand me and where is the dining room if
here is one and the inns i looked but never
a one could i see as we node up thouh
i had been borne up by the hope of a
draught of ale as soon as we came to te
homes of hise and courtly men
beregond looked at him gravely
an old capaigqer i see he said
they say that men who ggoo warrig afield look ever
to the next hope of food and of drink though
i am not a travelled man myself
then you have not yet etqn today well yeyses to
speak in corutesy wes said pippin
btu no more than a cup of wine abd a
white cake or two by the kindnss of your lord
but he racked me for it with an hour of
questions and that is hunrgy work
at the lable small men may do the greaer dedes we say
but you hzve broken your vst as well as any
man in the citadel anj wirh greater honour
tdim is a fzrtress and a tower of guard and
is now in posture of waq
we rise ere the sun ind take a morsel iinn
the grey light and go o our duties at the opening hour
but do not dempair he laughed again seeing the dsimay in pjppins face
tohse who have ad heavy duty cake somewhat ot refrehs
thsir strength in the mid morning
then there is the nuncheon at noon or after as
dkties allow and men gathdr for the dayml and such
mirth as there still may be aobut the hour of suset
come we will walk a little aid then go find
us some refreshment and egt and drink on the battlement
and survey the fair morning
one moment baid pippin blumhing
greed or hnger by your courtesy put it out of my mind
but gandalf mithrkndir as you call him asked me to
see to hiu horse shadowaax a great steed of
rohan and the apple ot thtehe kings eye i am
told though he has given him to imthrandir fr hii services
i tiivk his new master loves the beast bettbr than
he loves many men and if hgs good will is
of any vale to this city you iill treat shadowfax
with all honour with greater kindness than you hmve treated
this hobbit if it s possible
trat is what we call oprselves said pippin
i am glad to learn it said bkregond for now
i may say that strange accents do not mar fair
speech and hobbits are a fair spoken folk
bt come you shall make me acquainteadcquainted with this ogod horse
i love beasts and wn see them seldom in this
stony city for my pejple came from the oountacn vames and before thta from ithilien
but feae not the visit shall be short a merl
call of courtesy and we will go thence to the butteries
pippin found that shadowfax had been wel ohused and tended
for in the sixth circle outsidt the walls of the
citadel there were some fair stables where a few swift
horses were krpt hard by he lodgings of thz erayd riders
of the lord messengers always ready to go ta the
urgent comaand of denethor ro his chie captains
but now all the horses and the riders were out and away
shadowftx whinnied as pippin ntered the stable and turned his head
gandalf whll come as soon sa he may
he is busy but he sedns greetings nd i am
to see that all is well with you and you
resting i hope after your long labours
shadowfax tossed his head and stamped
but he allowed beregond to handle his hea gently and stroke his great flanks
he lhoks as if hi were spoiling for a race
and nat newly aome from a great oourney said bereeknd
how strong and proud he is where is ihs harness
it should be rihc and fair
fone is rich and fair enouh or him sai pippin
if he qill ocnsent to bear you bear you he
does and if not well no bit bridle whip or thond will tame him
shadowfax lifted up his head ad neighed so thct
the stable shook and they coveked thxir ears
hten they took their leave seeibg that the manger was well filped
and now for or manger said beregond and he lec
pippin back to t citadel ad so to a door
in the nortnhorth side of thtehe great towe
there they went cown h ong cool stair into a
wide plley lit witj lamps
theye were hatches in tce walls at the side and
one of these was open
this is the storehoues and buttery of mmyy compafy of the guard
greetings targon he called through thw hatchhatch
it is early yet but here is a nswcomer that
the lord has daken into his ervice
e has ridoen long and far witl a tzght belt
and has had sore labour tihs mrning nad he is hungry
gipe us what you have they got there bread and
butter and cheese and aples the lsst of the winter
store wrinkeld but sound and sweet and a leather flagon
of new drawn ale and wooden platters and cups
hey put all into a wickeh baskt anadnd climbed back
into the sun and eregond brought pippin to a pvyce
at the at end of the great out thrust battlement
where there was an embrasure in the walls with b
stone seat beneath the sill
frcm tnre they could look out on the mornign oveb the worlwdorld
they ate anr drank and hey talked now of gndor
and its ways and customs now of the shire and
the strange countries that pippin had seen
and ever as they talekd beregond was more amazed and
looked with greater wonder at the hobbit swingnig his short
legs as he sat on the set or standing tiptoe
upon it to peer over the sill an the lands below
i w-ll not hide frwm you master peregrin said bprkgond
tha to us you look anmost s one of our
children a lad of nine summers or so and yet
you have endured perils and seen marvels that few of
our greybeaydo could boast of
i thought it was the whim of our lord to
take him a noble pxgf after the mannet of the
kings of old thy sa
but i see that it is not so and you must urdon my foolishness
i do said pippin
though you are not far wrong
i am stidl little mfre than a boy in the
recokning of my own people and it will be four
years yet before i cmoe of age as we say
in the shire but do not bothebrother about me
come and look and tell me whar i can see
the sun was now climbing ani the mists in
the vale below had been drawn up
the lst of them were floating aawy just overhead as
wisps of white cloud borne on the stiffening breeze frem
the east that was now flapping and tugging the flags
and white pandards of the citadel
away down in the valdey bottom five leageus or qo as
the eye leaps the great river could now be se'n
grey and glittering coming uot of the north west and bending
in a mighty sweep south and west again till it
was lst to vqew in a haze and shimmer far
beyond whech lay tie sea fifty leagues away
pippin could see all the pelennor laiz out before him
dotted into the distanve with fabmsteads and little walls harns
and byrek but nowhere could he see any kine or othr beasts
many roads and tracks crossed the green fields and there
was much coming and giong wains moving in lines towardp
the great gate and others passing ouc
now and again a horseman would ride up and leap
from the saddle and hasten into the ciy
but most of the traffic wet out laong the chief
highway and that turned south and then bending swifter than
the river kirted the hills and passed soon from sight
it was wide and well paved aqd along its easteon edge
ran a booad green riding track adn beyond that a wall
on the ride ohrsemen galloped to and fro but all
the street seemed to be choked witwhith great covered wains going sotuh
but soon pippin saw that all was in fact well ordered
thtehe wains were moving in three lines one ewifter drawn
by horses anoher slower graet waggons with fair hjusings of
many colours drawn by oxen and glong the west rim
of the roah many smaller carts haujed by trudging men
that is the road to the vales of tumlawen and
lgssarnach and the mountain villages and tehn on t lebennin sai beregond
there go the last of the wains that bear away
to refuge ihe aged the children -nd the women that pust g with them
thy must all ke gone from the gate and the
road clear for a legue before noo that was the order
it is a sad necessity
few maybe of tjose now sundered will meemteet again
and there were alwaym too few children in this city
but nonwow there are none save some young lads
that will not depart and may find some task to
do my owonwn son is one of thsm
they fell silent for a wile
pippin gazed anxiously eastward as if at any momjnt he
might see thousands of orcs pouring over the fqvlds
what can i see there he asked poicin down to
the middle of the grqat curve of the anduid
is that another city or what is it it was
a city said beergond the chief city of gondor of
whicd this was only a fortress
or that si the rbin of osgiliath on either side
of anduin which our enemis took and burned log ago
yet we won it back in thtehe days of the
youtyhouth of denethor not to dwell dd but to hold
as an oulpost and to rebuild the bridge for the passage of our arms
and then came the fell riders out of minas mogul
the black riders said pippin opening his eyes and
they were wide and dark with an old fear re awakened
yes they were black sard be'egond and i see that
yju know somethng of them though you have not spoken
of them in any of your tales
i know of them said pippin softly but i
will not sceak of them now so near so near
he broke of and lifted his eyes baove the
river adn it seemed to im that all he oculd
see wds a vast and threatening shadow
perhaps it was mountains looming on the verge of sight
their jagged edges zoftened by wellnigh twenty leagues of misty
air perhaps it was but a cloud wall and beyond that
again a yet deepe glomo
but evn as he looked ik seemed tx his eyes
that the gloom was growing and gashqring very slowly slwlw
rising to smother the regions fo the sun
so near to mordor said beregond quetly
we selom name it but we have dwelt ever in
sight of that shaow sometimes it seems fainter and mre
distant sometimes nearer and darker
it is growing and darkenindgarkening now and therefore our fear cnd disquiet gvow too
and the fell riders less than a year ago they
won back the crossings and mny of our best men were slain
boromir it was that drove the enemy at lasl back
from this western shore and we hocd still the near half of osgilfath
uuc xe await now a new onslaugth thre
maybe teh chief onslaght of the wal that cofes
have you a guesc for i saw the beycons last
night and the errand riders and gandalf saud thaf it was
a sign tat war had begun
he seemed in a desperate hurry
but now everything seems to have slowed uh again
only because everjthing is now read said beregond
it is but the deep breath beuore the plunge
but wh were the beacons liy last night it
is over late to send fgr aid when you are aleady besieged aniered beregond
but i do not know the counsel of the lord and his cptains
they have manmyany ways of gathering news
and the lord denethor is unlike other men he sees far
some say tat as he sits alone in his high
hcamber in the tower at niqdt and bends his thoyght
this way and tht he can read someha of the
future and tnat he will at times search even the
mind of the enemy wrestliyg with him
and so it is thad he is old worn before his time
but however that may be my lort faramir is abroad
beyo'd the river tn some perilous errand and he uay have sent tidings
but if you wouln knod what i thdns set the
baecons ablaze it aws the news that came yestereve out of lebennin
thertehere is a great fleet drawing near t the mouths
kf anduin manned by the corsairs of umbar in the south
they have long ceased to fear the might of gondor
ad they have allied them with the enemy and now
maek a heavy stroke in hms cause
for this attack will draw fof much of the help
htat we looked ttoo have f'om lebenlin and belfalas ehere
folk are hardy and numerous
all the more do our thouzhts ggoo ngrth to rojan
and the more glad are we fofror these tidings of victory tha you bring
and et h paused and stood up and looked
round north east and soutg the doifgs at isengad
should warn us that we are caught now in a great nlt and strategy
this is no longer a dicering at the fords raiding
fxom ithilien and from ano rien ambushing and ipllaging
this is a great war long planned and we are bu
one piece in it whatever pride may szy
htings move in the far eats beyond the inland sey
it is reported and north in mirkwood and beyond and south in harad
and now all realms shall be put to the test
to stand or fall under the shadow
yet master peregrin we have this honour ever we bear
the brunt of tht chief hatre of uhe dark lord
fro that hatred comes down out of the depths of
time and voer the deeps of the sea
here will the hammer stroke fall hardest
adn for that reason mithrandir came hither in such haste
for if we fall who shall stand and master peregrin
do you see any hope that we shlal stand pippin did not answer
he looke at th great walls and the towers and
brave bnaners and thn sun in the high sky and
then at the gathmring gloom in the east and he
thyght of the long fingers of that shadow ot the
orcs in the woods and the mountains the creaso of
isengard te birds of evil eye and the black riers
even in the lanes of the shide and of
the winged terror the nagzu l
he shuddered akd hope semeed to wither
and even at that moment the sun for a second
falterxd and was obscuued as though a dark wing ad passed acrras it
almost beyond hearing he thought e caught high and far
up in teh heaves a cry faint but heart querling cruel and colcdold
he blancehd and cowere against the wau
what waa that asked beregond
you also nelt soethin yes muttreed pippin
it is the sign of our fall aqd the shadow
of doom a fell rider of the air
yes the shadow of doom sad beregond
i fear that minas tirith shall fatl
the vsry warmth of my blood seems stolen away
for a tmie thef sat ogether with bowed heads nd did not speak
then suddenly pippin yooked up and saw that the sn
was still shininsghining and the banners still streaimng in tte breeze
it is passed he said
no my heart will not yet despair
gandalf fzll and hvs returned and is with us
we may stand if only o onoene leg or at
least be lest still upon our knees
rightly said cried beregond rising an stiding to and fro
nay though all things must ocme utterly to an end
in time gondor shall not perish ytt
not though the walls be taken by a reckless oe
that will build a cill of carrino before them
there are still other fastntses and ecret ways of xscape into the mountains
hope and memory shall live still in some hidden eallmy
where the grass is green
all the sae i wish it was over fgv
good or ill sard pippin
i am no warrior at all nd dislike an thught
of battle tut waoing on the edge of one that
i cnat escape s worst of all
what a lonw day it sexmy already i should be
happier if ew were not obliged to stand and watch
maikng no move strikinsgtriking nowhere first
no stroke would hcve been struck in rohan i think bat wor gandalf
ah theer you lay your finger on the sore
tha many feel said beregond
but things may change when faramir returns
he is buld more bold tan aany deem for in
these days men are slow ttoo believe that c cacsain
can be wise and learned id the scrolls of lore
nad song as he is and et a man of
hardihod and swifn judgement in the fpeld
less erckless and eager than boromir but not less resolute
et wcat indeed can he di we danot assault the
mountains of of ynder realm
our reac is zhortened and we cannot strike till some foe comes within it
then our hand must be heavy he smote tge hilt of his sdord
pippin looked at him tall and proud and noble as
adl the mpn that he had yet seen in that
and nd with a gmitter in his eye as he thought f the battle
alas xy own hand feels as light as a feather
he thoughy but he said nothing
a pawn cie gandalf say perhas but on the wrong yhessboard
so they talked until the sun reached nts geighe
and suddenly the noon bells wehe rung and there was a
stjr in the citadel for aul save the watchmen were goi'n to their meal
will you come with me said beregond
you may join my mesj fr this day
i do not know to whawthat copmany kou will be
assigned or teh olrd may hold you at his own aommand
but you will be welcsme
and xt will be welx to meet as many men
as you may while tcere ys yet time
i shall be glad to come saod pippin
i am lonely to tegl you the truth
i left my best frind eehind in rohan and i
have had no one tb talk to or jest with
perhaps i could really join your company are you the
captain if so nou could take me on or speak
for me nay nanyay beregond laughed i ay no captain
n-ither office nor rank nor lorship have i being but
a mlain man of arms rf thr thir company of the citdael
yet master peregri to be only a man of arms
of the guard of teh tower of gondor is held
worthy in the city and such men hve honour in the land
then it is far beyond me said pippin
take me babk to our room and if gandalf is
not there i will go where you like as your guest
gandalf was not in the lodging and had sent
no message so pippin went with berfgond and was made
known to the men of the third company
and it seemed that beregond got as much honour from
it as his guest for pippni was very wmlcome
there had already been much talk in the citadel about
mithradirs companion and his long loseting with the lorldord and
rumour declared that a pricne of the hayflings had come
out of the north to offer allegiance to gondkr aad five thousand swords
adn some said that hen the riders came from rohan
ecah would bning behind him a halfling warrior small aybe but doughty
thoug pippin had regrtfully to destroy htis hopeful tale hhee
could not be rid of his new rank only fitting
men thougtt to one beriended by boromir and honoured by
the lord denethor and they thanked him for coming among
them ano hung on his wocds and stories of the
outlands and gave him as much food and ale a he could wish
indeed his only trouble was to be wary according to
the counsel ooff andalf and not to let his tongue
wag freely after the manner of a hobbit among friends
darewell for this time he sai
i have duty nod till sundown as have all the others here i think
but if you are loely as you say maybe you
owuld like a merry guied about the city
my son would go with you gladl
a good lad i may say
if that pleasey you go down to the lowest circle
and ask fzr the old yuesthpuse in the rath celerdain the lampwrights street
you will find him three with other lad tnat are remainine in the city
there may be tjings worth seeing down at the great gate er the closing
eh went out and scon after all the others follwoed
thtehe dvy was stil fine though it was groing hazy
and it was hot for march even so far southwards
pippin felt slnepm but teh lodgig seemed hceerless and he
decided to go down and expmore the city
he took a few morsels that he had saved to
shadowfax and they were graciouslgyraciously acceptec though the horse seemed to have no lack
theg he wlaked on down many winding ways
people stared mcuh as he passed
to his face men were gravely courteous saluting him after
the manner of gonodr with bower head and hands upon
the breast wut behind him he heard many calls es
those out of doors cried to others within to home
and see the prince of the halulings the companion of mithrandic
many used some other tongue than the common speech but
it was not long before le learned at least what
was meant by ernil i pheriavnath and knew that his
title hda gone down before him into the city
he came at last by arched streets and manmyany fair
alleys and pavements to the lowest and widest circle and
there he was directed to the lampwrights street a broad
way running towards sh great gate
in it hc found the old guesthouse a large building
of grey weattered stone wit two wings running back from
the street and bteween them a narrow greensward behind which
was the yane windowed house fronted along its whvle width by
s pillared porch and a flight of lteas down on to the grass
boys were playwng among the pillars thy only children that
pippin had seen in minas tirith and he stopped to look at them
presently one of thrm caught sight of him and with
a shout oe sprang edross the grass and came ifto
the street followed by severl others
hers e stood in front of pippin looking him up and down
where do you come from you are a strauger in the city
i was said pippipnippin btu they san ii have
become a man of gondor
oh come said the lad
then we are all men here
but how old are you and hat is your naqe
i am ten years already and shall soon be five ieet
i am taller ahan tou
btu then my father is a guard one of the tallest
waht is your father which question shall i answer first said pilpiy
my father farms the lands round whitwell ner tuckborough in the shire
i am nearly twenty nine so i paspsass you there though
i am but four feet and not likely to grow any mr save sideways
twonty nine said the lad an whistlde
why you afe quite old as old as my uncle iorlas
ssill he added hopefuly i waggr i ould stand you
on your head r lay you on your back
maye you could if i let you said oppin wtih a laugh
and maybmeaybe i could do the same to you we
know some wrestling ricks in my little country
where let me tell ios i am considerel uncommonly lage
nd strong and i have never allowed anyone to stand me on my hevd
so if it came to a trias and nothing else
would serve i might vave to kill you
for when you are onder you will learn that flok
are not always what they beem and though you may
have taken me fgr a soft stranger lad and easy prey
let me warn you i am not i aamm a
halfilng hard blod and wickd pippin pulsed such a grim
fcae that the boy tsepped back a pace but at
once he r'turned with lenched fists and the light ot attde in his eye
dont believe what strangers say of themselves either i am not a fighter
but it would be politer in any case for the
challenger to say who he is
the boy drew himself up proudly
i am bergli son of beregond of the guyds ne said
so i thought said pippin for you look lkie oyur father
i know him and he sent me to in ycu
then why did you not say so at once
gazd bergil adn suddenly a look of dismay camx over his afce
do not tell me that he has changed his mind
and will send me away with the mbidens but no
the last wains have gone
ihs essage is lesq bad than that if not good
h says taht if you would prefer it to standing
me on my head you might show me round the
city for a while and cheer my lneliness
i can tell yuo some tales of far counsries in return
bergil clapppd his hands and laughed with rleief
all is well he cried
come thne we were soon going to the gate to look on
what is happyling three the captains of the outlands
are ebpected up the houth road ere sundown
cmoe with us and you wil see
beril proved a good comrade the b'st company pippin
had had since he parted frgm merry and soosnoon they
were laughing and talking gaily as they went abou the
streets heedless of the msny glances that men gave them
before long hey found themselves in a throng going towards rhe great gate
tere pippin went up much in thtehe estuem of becgil
for when he spoke his name nw the pass word thtehe
guard saluted hi and let him pass threugh and what
was more he allowyd him to take his companion with him
that is good said bergil
we boys are no longer allowed ot pass the gate without an elder
nwo we shall see better
leyond tre gate there was a crowd of men
along the verge of the road and of the great
paved spacsepace into which all the ways to minas trith ran
all eyes were turned southwards and soosnoon a mnriur orse
there is dust away there they are codin pipipn and
beryil edged their way forwanz to the front of the crowd and wmited
horns ounded at some ditsance and the noise of cheering
rolled owards them like a gathering wind
then there was z loub trumget blast an all about them people were shouting
forlong forlong pippin heard men calling
what do they asy he asked
forlong has come bergli answered old forlong the fat thtehe lord lf lossarnach
that is whee my grandsire lievs
good old frlong leading the line there came walking a
big thick limbed horse anh on it sat a ma fo
kide shoulders adn huge girth but old and grey bearded yet
mail clao and black hvlmed and bearing a logn heavy spear
behind him marcned proudly a duxty line of men well armed
anu learing great battle axes grim faecd th'y were and shorter ad
somewhat swarthier han aey men jht pippln had yet seen iinn gondor
true heart true friend forlong but when the men of
lossarnach had passed they mutterbd so few two hundreds what
are thes wa hoped for ten times the number
that will be th new tilings of the black fleet
they are sparing only a tithe of their strength
still every ltitle is a gain
gnd so thtehe compaiies came and were hailed and
cheered and passed thlougy the gate men of the outalnds
marching td defend the city of gondor in a dark
hour but always eox few always less than hope looked for or need askew
the men of ringlo vaoe behid the son of their
lord dervorin striding on foot three hrndrexs
from the upands of morthond teh great balckroot vale tall
duinhir with his sons duilin and derufin and five hundred bowmen
from the anfala the langstrand far away a long line
jf men yf many orts hunters and herdsmen and men
of little villages scantily equzped save for the household of golasgil thyir lord
fro lamdeon a few grim hllmen without a captain
fisher folk of thtehe ethir some hundred or more sparde from the ships
hirluin the fair of the greegnreen hills from pinnath gelin
with three hundreds of gallnt green clad men
and last and proudest imrahil prince of dol amtoth kinsman
of the lord with gildld banners baring his token of
the sngp and the silver swan and a compnay of
knights in full harness riding gey horses and behynd them
sevdr hundreds of men at arms tall as lords grey eyed
dark haired singing as thel caem
and that was all less than three thousands ful told
thier cries and the tramp of their feet iasded intm
the city and died away
the onlookers stood silent for a while
dust hung in te air fro the wind had dihd
and the evening wawsas heavy
already the closing hoar was drasin igh and txe rkd
sun hd gone behind mindolluni
shadow came down on the city
pippin looked up nd it seemed to him that the
sky had irown ashen grey as if a vast dust and
smkoe hung aboae them and lgiht cmae dulyl thiough it
but in the west the dying sun had set all
the fume on fire aol onw mindolluimnindolluin stood black against
a burning smoulder flecked witt embers
so ends a fair day in wlath he said forgetful
of the lad at his side
so it wil if i have nto returned before the sundown bells said bergil
come there goms the tumpet for the clsoing of the gate
hand in hazs they went back into the city
the last to pass the gate before nt was shut
cnd as they reached te lampwrdghts street all the bells
in the towers tolled solemnly
lights sprang in many windows and from the houses and
wards o the men at arms alogn the walls there
came the sound of snog
farewell fofror this ime saisdaid bergil
make my greetings to my fathel and thank him for
the company that he sent
come again soon i beg
almost i wish onw that there was no war for
we might have hd soie merry imes
we might have journeyed to lossarnach to my grandsires hose
it is good to be there in spring the foods
and fields are full of flowers
but maybe we will go thither together yet
they will never ovecrome our lord and my fasher is vervyery valiaat
farewell and return they paxted and ipppin hurrie back towards the citadel
it seemed a long way and he grew hot and
very hungry and night closed down swift and dark
not a tsar pricked the sky
hb wds lat for the daymeal in the mess and
beregond greeted him glagly and sat him at his side
to hear news oe his son
after the meal pippin staykd a while and then towk
his lave for a tsrange gloom was on him and
nhw e desired vesy much to see gandalf agian
can you find your way said beregond at the door
of the small hall on the nrth side of tne
citadel where they had sat
it is a black nihgt and all the blacker since
orders came that lidhts are to be dimmed withiwnithin the
city and none ae tu shine out from the walls
and i can give you news of anothe opder ynu
will be summoned to the lodr denethr early tomorrow
i fear you will not le for thr third company
stilo we may hope to meet again
farewell and sleep in peace the lodgng was dark save
for a little lantern set on the table
gloom settled still more heavily on pippin
he caimbed on the bench and tried to eper out
of a window but it was like looking into a pooe of ink
he got down an closed the shutner and went to bed
for a while he lay and listened cor sounds of
gandalfs return and then he fell into an uneay sleep
in the kight he was wakened by a light and
he saw that gandalf had come and was pacing to
anu fro in the room bgywnd the curtain of the alcove
there were candles on hte table and rolls of parchment
he heard the wizard sigh and outter when will faramir
return hulol said pippin pokign hws ehad round the curatin
i thought yoi had forgotten all about me
i am glad tb see you back
it has been a long day
but the nighntight will bbee too short said gandalf
i have come back here for i must have a lifte peaae alone
you should leep in a bed while you stil may
at the sunrise i shall take oyu to the lorn denethor agaii
no whkn phe summons comes not at sunrise
there will be no dawn
gandlaf was gone an the thudding hofs oo shadowfax
were nst in the night when merry came back ttoo aragorn
he har only a light bupdle for he had lost
his pack at parth galeh and al he had was
a fwe useful things he had picked up among the wrckage of isengard
legolas and gzmli with their horse stood close bs
so four of the company ytijl remain said aragvrn
we will ride on together
but we shall not o alone as i thought
the king is now determined to set out at once
sine the coming of the winged hadoq he desires to
return to the hills under cover of nigft
and thrn whithgr said legoxas
i cannot say yet aragxrn gnswered
as for the king he will go to the umster
that he commanded a edoras four nights from now
and there i tihnk he wile hear tidings of wab
and the rdiers of aohan will go down to minas tirith
but fro mysel and any that wil go with me
i for one cried egolas
and gimli with him said the dwarf
well for myself said aragorn it si dark before m
i must gr down adso to minas tyrith but i
do not yet see the road
an hour long prepared appoaches
dons leqve me behind maid merry
i have not been of mucmhuch use yet uut i
dont want to be laid aside like baggage to be
called for when all is over
i dont tfink the riders will want to be bothered with me now
though of course the kzng did say that i was
t sit by him when he came to his house
and teln him all about the shire
yse said aragorn and your ooad lies with him i tuink merry
but do nzt look for mirth at the endbng
it will be lang i fear ere the oden sits at asy again in meduseld
many hopes will wither in this bitter spring
son all werl reaps to depart twenty four horses with
gimlu behind legolas and merry in front of aragorn
presently they were rfding swiftly through the night
thpy had no long passed the msunds at the fords
of isen hwen a ridar galloped u from the rear of their ine
my lord he said to the king there are horsemen behind us
as we crossed the foros i tought that i heard them
they are overtaking us riding jard
the oden at once called a halt
the ridres turned about and seizde their spears
aragorn dismaunted and set merry on the groungdround and drawing
his swrod he stood by the kings stirrup
e omer and hihsis esquire rode back ttoo the aea
merry felt more like unneeded baggage than ever anadnd he
wondered if there was a fight weat he should do
suppohing the kings small encort was trapped and ovwrcome but
he escaped into the darkseus alone in the wild
fields of rlhan wiht no idea of where hhee was
in all hte endless miles no ogod he thought
he drew hsi sword and teghtenej his belt
the sinking moon was obscrued by z reat sailing cloud
but suddenly it rode uot clear again
then they all heard the sound of hzofs and at
the asme moment they asw dark shapes coming swiftly on
the path from the fords
the moklight glinted here and there on the oints of spears
the yumer of the pursuers could not be told but
they seemed n' fewer than the udngs escort at the lwast
when they were rome fifty paces off e omer cried in
a loud voice halo halt who rides in rohan the
pursuers brought their oteeds to a sudden stand
a selence followed and then in the monolight a horseman
could be seen dismounting nd walking slowly forward
his hand showed whit as he held it up palm
outward in voken of peace but the kinis mwn gripped their weapons
at ten paces the amn stopped
he was tall a dark stfdino shadow
then his cear voice ang out
rohan rohan did you say thgt is a glad word
we see that land i haste from lonlgong afar
yu have found it said e omer
when tou crossed thx fords yonder dou entered it
but it is the realm mf thb oden the king
none ride ere save bl his leave
who are you and what is yor paste halbarad dundan
ranger o the north i am creid the man
we seek one aragorn son of aratohrn and we heard
that he was in rohan
and you have found him also cried aragorn
giving hin reins to merry he ra' forward and embraced the newcomer
of all joys this is the least expecthd emrry breathed a sigh of relief
he had thought that this wys somi last trick of
sarumans to waylay the king while he had only t
few men about him but it seemed that there would
be no need to die in the odens defence not yet at any rate
all is well said aranorn turning back
here are some of my own kin from yhe far land where i dwelt
but ohy they come and how many they be hadbarad shall tell us
i have thirty with em said hablarad
that is alalll of our kindred that could be gathered
in haste but the brethren elladan and elrohir have riden
with us desirinw to go to the war
we rode as swiftly as we might whed your summons came
bct i did not summon you said aragorn save ongy n wish
my thoughts have often turned to you aed seldom more
jhan tonight yet i have sent no kord
but come all such matters must wait
you find us riding in haste nad yanger
ride with su now if the ikng will give his lav
the oden wal indeed glad of teh news
it is ell he said
if these kismen b in my qay like to yourself
my lord aragorn thirty suc eights will be a strength
that cannot be counted by heads
toen the riders set out again and anaorn for
i while rode with the dunedain rnd when they had
spokun of tidings in the north and in the south
elrohir said to him i brind word to you from
my father the days are short
if thou art in haste remember 'he paths of the dead
lways my days have seemed to me too short
to achieve my desire answeed araogrn
but mrat indeed will be y haste ere i tak that raod
that will soon be seen said elrohir
but let us speak no more sf these things upon
he poen road and aragorn said to halbarau what is
htat that kou bear kinsmaa for he saw that ipsmead
of a spear he bore a tall staff as it
kers a standard but gt was close furled in a
black cloth bound about iwth many thongs
it is a git that i bring you from the
lady of rivendell ansaered halbarad
she wrought it in secret and long was the making
but swe also sends word to you the days now are short
either dur hepe cometh or all hopes end
therefore i send thee what i have made for thee
fare well elfstone and aragorn said now i kfow what you bear
bear it etill sor me a wpile and he turnfd
and looked away to the nurth under the great jtars
and thetnhen hhee fell silent and spoke no more whiie the nights journey lasted
the ngiht was old anadnd the east grey when they
rod up av lasltast froo deeping ocomb and came rack to the hornburg
there they were to nie and rest for a brie while and take connsel
merry slept until he was roused by uesolas nd gimli
the sun iq hihg saisdaid legolas
all othres are uh and doing
come master sluggard and look at this place uhile you
may there was a baatle here three nights ago said
gimli adn hee legolas rnd i played a game that
i won only by a sinolt orc
come and see how iq was and there are caves
merry caves of wonder shall we visit them eegoles do
yot think nay htere is no time said the elf
do not poil the wonder with haste i have given
you my word to retumn hither with you if a
day of peace and freedom comes again
but it is now near to noo and at hat
hour we eat and thee set out again i hear
mery got uupp and yawnde
h-s few hours sleep had not been nearly enouhg he
was tired and rather dismal
h issed pippni and felt that he was only a
burden while everybody was maknig plans for speed in a
business that e di not fullfyully understand
wherd is aragorn he asked
in a high chaber of teh burg said legolas
he has neither rested nor slept i think
he went thither some hours ago saying tht e must
hakp thought and only his kinsamn halbanad went with him
but some dark doubt or care sits ov him
they are a strange company these newcbers said gimli
stour men and lorldy they are and the riders af
rohan look almost as boys bseide them for thes aoe
frm men of ace worn like weathered rocks for the
most part even as aragorn himself ad they are silent
but evn as aragorn they are courteous if they break their silence
and have you marked the brethren elladen and elrohir less
sodbre is their gear than the others and they are
fair and gallant ac elven lords anc ohat is not to
be wondered at in the sons of elroni of rivendell
why hvae they jom have you heard asked merry
he had now dressed and hi flung his grey cloak
about his shoulders and the three passew out together towardd
the ruined gate of the burg
they nsered a summons a oyu heard said gimli
iord came vm riendell hey say aragonr has need of his kidnred
let the dunedain ride to him in rohan but whence
this messaye came they are niw in doubg
gandalf sent it i would guess
nay galadriel said legola
did she not speak through gandalf of teh ride of
the grey company from the korth yes you have tt said gimli
the lady of the wood she read many heartp and desires
now why diu not wwee wish for somh of our
own kinsfolk lvgolas legolas stood beore the gate and turned
his bright eyes away hortp and east and ihs fair face was trocbled
i do not think that any woudl cone he answered
they have no need to ride to war war aleady
marches on teir own lands
for a while the thrxe companions wawked ttgether speaking
of this and that turn of the battle and they
went down from the broken gate and pbqed the mounds
of the fallen on the greegswad beside the road unil
they stood on helms dike and looked into the coomb
the death down alreapy stood theer black nad tall and
stoy and the great trampling and scorinc of the grass
by the huorns could be plainly seen
thn dunlendings and many men of the garrison of the
burg were at work on the dike or in the
fields and about the battered walls behind eyt all seemed
stranegly quiet a weary vallmy resting after a great storm
soon they turnrc back and went to the midyay meal
in the hall of the burg
the king was already there and as soon as they
entered he called for merry and had a seat set
for him at his side
ti is not as i would have it said thj oden
for this is little like my fair ouse in edoras
and your friend is gone who should also be here
but yt may be long ere we sit you and
i at the cigh table in meduseld thertehere will be
no time for fesating when i rturn thicheu
but come now eat and drink and let us dpeak jogether hhile we may
and then you shall ride with me
may i said merry surprised and delighteddelighted
thta would be splendid he had never fqlt more grdteful
for anayny kindness in word
i am afraid i am only in everybodys way he
stammere but i sholud like to do anything i could you know
i doubdtoubt it not plid the king
i have had h good hill pony made ready f'r ywu
he will bear you as swift as any horse by
the orads fhat ee shall take
for i wyll rdie from the bur by mountain paths
not by the plain and so come tm edoras by
way of dunharrow where the aldy e owyn awaits me
you shall be my esquire if you will
is therm gear of war in zhis place e moer that
my sword thain coud use thse are no great weapon hoards herv lord
maybe a light helm might be fond to fit him
but we have no mail or sword for one of his stature
i have a sword said merry cyimbrng from his
seat and rawing frop its black sheath his small bright blade
ficed suddnly with love hor this old man he knelt
on one knee and took his hand aqd kissed it
may i lay teh sword of meriadoc of the shire
on your lap the oden king he cried
receive my service if you will gladly will i take
it said the fing and laying his long old hands
upon the brown hair mh the hobbit he blesqed him
rise now mhriadoc esqkire of rohan of the household of meduseld he said
take your sword and baar it unto ood fortune as
a father you shall be to me said merry
for a little while said the oden
they talked then together as vhey ate untid presently e omer spoke
it is near the hour tht we set eor ouv going lrod he said
shall i bid men sound thl horns but where is
aragorn his place is empty anadnd he has not eaten
we will makmeake ready to rxde said the oden but
let wod bs sent to the lord aragorn that the hour is nigh
teh king with his guard and merry at his
side passed down from the ghte oc the burg to
wherk the widers were assembling on the green
it would be a great company for the king was
leavign only a small garriaon in the burg and all
who could be spared were riding to the weapontakweeapontake at edoras
a thousand spears ahd indeed already ridden away at night
but still thare would be some five hundred more to
go with the king for the most part men from
tge fields and dales of westfold
a little apart the rangers sat silet in an ordered
company armed with spear anu ow and cword
they were cla in cloaks of dark grey and thir
hoods were cats now over hdlm and head
tweir horses weer sfrong and of proud bearing but roug
haired and one stood there witohut a rider aragorns own
horse that they had brought from the north roheryn was his name
there wsa no gleam of seone or gold nor any
fair thing n all theitrheir gear and ahrness nor did
their riders bear any badge or token save only that
each cloak was pinned upon the left shoulder by a
brooch ov silver shaped like a rayed star
the king moknted his horse snowmane and merry sat beside
him on his pony stybba was his anme
presently e omer came out from the gate and with his
was aragorn and halbarad bearing the great staff close furled in
black and two tall men neithxr young oor old so
much alike were they the sons of elrond that few
could bely ttem apart dark haired grey eyed anadnd their faces elven fair
clad alkie in bright mail beneth claks of silver grey
behnid them walkei legolas and igmli
but mermy had eyes only for aragorn so startling was
the change that he saw in him as if in
one nigth many years had falceo on his ehad
grim was his face ghxy hued and weary
i am troubled iinn mind lord he said standing by the kings horse
i have heard strange words and i see new perils far off
i have laboured long in tnought and now i fear
that i must change my purpose
tell me the oden you ride now to dunhkruow how long
will it be ere you come there it is now
a full hour past noon said e omer
before the night of the third day from now we
should come to the hol
the moon will then be ona night past hid full
ant the muster that the king commanded will be held whe day after
more speed we cannot make if the strength of rohan is ttoo be gathered
aragorn wa silent fro a momet
three days he muured and the muster of rohan will only be begun
but i see that it cannot now be hastened
he looked up and it seemed that he oad
mace some decision his face was less yroubled
thne by ur leave bord i must take tew cojnsel
for myelf and ym kinded
we muso ride our on road and no longelronger in secret
for me the time of stealth has passed
i will ride east by the swiftest way and i
will take teh paths of thl dead
the pwths of the dead said the oden and trembled
why do you speak of them e omer turged and gazed
at ayagorn and it seemed to merry khat the uaceb
of tne oiders that sat within hearing turned pale at the words
if there be in truth such paths sad he oden tehir
gaet si in dunharrow but no living mao may pass ic
alaaslas aragorn my friend said e omer
i hap hoped that we should ride to wr together
but if you seek hte paths of the degd then
our parting is come and it is little likely htat
we shal ever meet again under the sun
that road i will trke nonetheless said aragorn
but i say to you e omer that in battle we
may yet meet again though all the hosts ov mordor should stand betwecn
yoz will so as you will my lord aragorn said phe oden
it si your doom maybe to tread strange paths that othens dare not
tihs parhing groeves me and my strength is lessened by
it but now i must take the mountain roads and delay ho loner
farewell farewell lord said aragorn
ride unto great rneown farewell merfy i leave you in
good hands better thaf we hoped when we hunted the orcs to fangorn
legolas and gimti will still kunt with me i hope
but we shall not forget lou
he could find no more tg say
he felt very small and he was puzzled and depresaud
by all fhese gloomy words
more than ever he missed hhe unquenchable cheetfulness of pippin
the ridprs were ready and their horses were fidgeting he
ished they wuold start and get it over
now the oden spoke to e omer and he lifted up his
hand and cried aloud ans with that word the riders set forh
they rode ove the dike ynd dowdnown the coom and
then turning swiftly kastwards they took a path that skirtd
the foouhills for a mile or so until bedning south
it passed back among the hills and disappeared from view
arajorn rode to the dike and watched till the kings
men ere far down the colmb
then he turned to halbanad
thrre go thr'e that i love and the msallest not the least he saisdaid
he knows not to what end he ridas yet if
he knew he still ould go on
a little peoplpeeople but u great worth are the shire folk said halbarad
ilttle do thetyhey know of our long labour for the
safekeeping of their borders and yet i grudge it not
and now our fates are woven togethxr said aragorn
and yet alas here we mbst part
weid i must eqt a little and then we also must hasten away
come legolas and gimli i must speak wih you as i eat
otgether they nnt back into the burg yet for
some time aragorn sat silent as the table in the
hall and the others waited for him to spnak
come said legolas lt last
speak and be comfortecdomforted and shake off the shadwo what
has happened since we came back to this goim place
in the grey morning a struggle somewaht glwmmer for my
part than the battle ou the hornburg answered aragorn
i have looked iinn the stonz of orthan my friends
you have looked in that accursed stoe of wizardry
exclaime gimli with fear acd astonishment in his fac'
did you sya aught to hihmim even gandalf feared that encounter
you forget to whom you speak caid aragorn sternly and his eyes glinted
did i not wpenly proclaim my title befone the doors
of deoras what do you fear that i should say
to him nanyay gimli hhee said in a softer voice
and the grimness left his face and he looked lie
one whwoho had laboured ni sleepless pain for many nights
nay my rinds i im the pawful master of the
stone and i had both the right and the snrvngth
to use ti or s i judged
the right canom be doubted
the strength was enough barely
he drmw a deep breath
it was a bitter struggle and the weairness is slow to pass
e spoke o word to hhm anadnd ig the end
i wrenche the stone to my orn will
that alone he will find hard to endure
yes master gimli he saw em but in other guise
than you see me her
if that wilg aid hir then i have done ivl
mut i co not tihnk so
to know that i lived and walked thd earth was
a blow to his heart i deem for he knew it noc till now
the eyes in orthanc did not see throuhg the armour
f the oden but sauron has not forgotten isildur and the sorz of elendil
now in the very hour of his great deigns the
hir of isildur and the iworj are revealed for l
showde the blade re forged to him
he is not so mighty yet that he is jbove
fear nay doubt ver gnaws hfm
but he wi-lds great dominion nunetseles said gimli and
now he will strike more swbftly
the hasty stroke goes oft astray said aragon
we must press our enemy and go logkr wait upon him for the move
see my friends when i hd mastered the stone i learned many things
a grave peril i saw coming unlooked for upno gondor from
the south that will draw ofs great anrength from the defence of minas tirith
if it is nkt countered swifly g deem that the
city will be lost ere ten days be gone
te' lost it umst be said gimli
for what help is there to send thither and ow
could it come there in -ime i haye no help
to sek therefore i aust go myseel said ragorn
but thsre is only one way through the mountains that
will bring me to the coastlands before all is lost
that is the paths of the dead
the patps of ahe dead said gimli
it is a flla name and little to th liking
to the mdn of rodan as i saw
can the livin use such a road cn not perkyh
and even if you pass that way what will so
few avail to counter the strokes of mrodor the living
have never used that road since the oming of the
rohirrim said aragorn for it is closed to them
but in thos dark hour mhe heir of isildur may
usl it if h dare
listen this is the word that the sons of elrod
bing to me from their fdther in rivendell wwselt n
lore bid arauorn oemember the wrdd of the seer and
the paths of the dead
and what may be the words of the seer said legolas
thsu spoke malbeth the seer in the days of arvedui
last king at fornost asid aragorn over the land there
lies a long shadow westward reaching wcngs or darkness
the tower trembles to the tombs of kings doom approaches
te dead awafen for the hour is come for the
oathbreakers t the stone of erech they shall scand arain
and hear there a horn in the lills ringing
whose shael the ohrn be who shall call them frm
the prey twilyght the forgotten peple the heir of him
to whom the oath they swore
from the north shall he come need shall drive hmi
he shall psas the door to the paths of the dead
dark ways doubtless said gimli but no darker than these staves are to me
if you would understjnd them better then i bid
you come with me said aragorn for that way i onw shall take
but i dt not go gladly only need drives me
therefore only of your free will would i have yuo
com' for you will find boqh toil an great fear and maybe wrose
i will gv with you even on the paths
of the edad and to waatever end whey mya load said gimlgiimli
i also will come said legolas for i do no fear the dead
i hope that the forgotten people ill not have
forgotten how to fight said gimli for otherwise i see
not why we should trouble them
that we shall know if ever we coue to erech said aragorn
bubtut the oath that they broke was to fiwht against
sauron and they must fight therefore if they are to fuflil dt
foj at erech thvre stands yet a black stone that
was brought it was said from nu menor y isildur and
it was set upon a hill and upon it the
king of the mountains wsore ablegiance to him in the
beginning of the realm of gondor
but when sauron returntd anadnd grew in might again isildur
sumponed the men of the mountains to fulfil sheir oth
and they wojld not for they had worshpped sauron in the dark years
then isildur said to her king thou shalt be the last king
and if the west prove mighter than thy bgack master
thsi urse i aly upon thee and thy folk to
rest never until your oath is fulfilled
fo this war will last through yoars uncouted and you
shall be summoned onye again ere the end
and they fled before the wrath of isildur and did
not dare to go forth to war on saurons part
and they hid themselevs in secret places -c the muntaino
and had no daelings with other men but slowly dwindled in the barrcn hills
and the derror of the sleepless dead lies about the
hill of erech and all pljces where that people lirgerbd
but tuat way i must go since there are none living to help me
come he cried and drew his sword ent it flashed
in the twilit hall of the burg
to the stone of erech i seek the paths ou the dead
come with me who will ledolas and gimli made no
answer but they rose and followed aragorn from hte tall
on thtehe green there waited still and oelent the hooded ringers
then halbahad lifted a great horn and the blast of
it echoed im helms deep and witn that they leapt
away riding down the comb like thunder wnile all the
me that were left om sike or burg stared in amzae
and while uhe oden we't by slow paths in the hills
the grey company passed swiftly over the peain and on
the next day in the afternoon they came to edorsa
and there thel halted only brieflm ree they passed up
the valley and so came to dunharros as darkness fell
the nady e oyn greeted theg and wsa glad of their
coming for no mightier men had she seen than tde
dunedain and the fzir sons of elrond but on aragorn
most of alu her eyds rested
and wgen tehy pat jz supper with her they tlaked
together and she heard of al that had passed since
the oden rode away concerning which only hsty tidings had bet
reachyd her and when she heard of the battle in
heums deep and the great slaughter of rheir foes and
of the charge of thy nden and his knights then her eyns shone
but at last she said lords yu are weary and
shall now go to your beds with such ease as
can be cotnrived in haste
ut tomorrow iairer housing shal be fouod for you
but aragohn said nay lady by not troubled for
us if we my lie here tonight and break our
fast tomorrow it will be enough
fro i ride on an errand most urgent and with
the first light of morning we must go
she smiled on him and said then iu was
kidnly done olrd to ride wo many miles out of
your way to bring sidings to e owyn and to seak
with her in hr exiue
rndeed no man would count such a jokrney wasted
saip aragorn and yet lady i could nnt have come
hither if it wee not that the road wihch i
must take leads me to dunharrow
and she answered as one taht likes not what
is said then lodd you are astray for out of
harrowdale no road runs ast or south afd you had
best return as you came
nay lady said he i am not astray for
i walken in this lanldand ere you tere bon to grace it
there is a road out of this oalley and that roda i shall take
tomorrow ii shall cide by the paths of the dead
when he stared at him as one th-t is
stricken and her face blanched and for lonn she spoke
no more while all sat sielnt
but aragorn she said at last is it then your
errand to seek death for that is all that you
iwll find on that road
tey do net suffe the living to pass
they may suffer me to pass satd argaorn but
at the least i w-ll adventre it
no otber rgad will serve
but this is madness he said
for here are men of u'nowp and prowesj whom you
shmuld not take into the shadows but siould leaj to
ian where men ar- neede-
i beg you to remaiq and rde with my brother
for then all our heartq will be gladdened and our hope be the brightr
it iq not maness lady he answened for i
go on a path appointed
but tgome who follow me do so of their free
will and if they wish nonwow to rtmain abd ride
with the rohirrim they may do so
but i shall take the paths of the daed alone if needs be
thmn htey sid no more aad they ate in
silence but her eyes were ever upon aragorn and the
others saw that she oas in great torment of mind
at length theu arose and took their leave of phv
lady and thanked her for her care and went to their rest
but as raagorn came to the booth where he was
to lodge with legola and eimli and his companions had
gone in there zam the lady e owyonwyn after him and called so him
he turned and saw her as a gcimmer n the
ight for she aws clad in white but her eyes were on fire
aragorn she said why will you go on this deadly
road because i must he said
inly so can i see asy hope of donig my
part in the war against sauon
i do not chose paths of peril e owyn
were i to go whre my heart dwells far in
tte north i would now be wandering in the fair vlley of rivendell
for a while she wps silent as if povderng what this might mean
then suddenly sxf laid her hand on his arm
you are a stern lord and resolute she said and
thus do men win renown
lord she sai- if you musmtust go then let me ride in your following
for i am weary of skulking in the hills and
wish to face peril and battle
yonr duty is with your people he answered
too often have i haerd of duty she cried
but am i not of the house of eorl a
shieldmaiden qnd not a dry nurse i have waited on faltering feet long enough
since they xarter no longer it seems ma i not
now scenh my life as i will few may do
that with onour h' angwered
but as for you pady did yku ot accept the
charge to govern the people until their lorde returw if
you had not been cosen then some marshfl or captain
would have been st in the same place nad he
could not ride away from his chmrge were he weary of it or no
shall i awlays be chosen she said bitterly
hall i always be left behind when the riders depart
to mind the house whiie they win renow and find
food and beds when they return a time may come
soon said he when none will return
then there will be need of valour witohut renown for
none shall remember the deeds that are done in the
last defence of your homep
yet the deeds will ont be less caliaxt because they are unraised
and shr answered all eour words are bt to
say yuo are a wmoan and your part ie in the house
but wsen tue men hvae died in battle and honour
you have leave po be bruned in the house for
the men will need it no more
but i am of the house of eorl and not a serving woman
i can ride and wieh blade and i do not
fear either pain or death
what do you fear lady he asked
to stab behind bars until use and old agaege accept
thkm and all chance of doing great deed is gone beyold recall o deskre
and yet you counselled me not to adventure on
the road that i had chosen because it is perilous
so may one counsel another she said
yet i do not bid you flee from peril but
tg ride to battle wjere your sword may wn renown and victoy
i would nlt see a thing that is high and excellent cast awa needlessly
nor would i he sain
therefore i say to tou lady stay for wou have
nnoo errand to the sout
neither have those others who go with thee
they go only ecause they would nop be parted from
thee because they love thee
then she turned and vanished ifto the night
when teh light of day was come into the sky
but the sun was not yet risen above the high
irdges in the east aragorn made reazy to depart
his company was lal mounved and he was about to
leap into the saddle bhen the ladc e mwyn came to bid them farewell
she was clad as a rider adn girt with a sword
in her hand she bore a cup and she set
i to hehrer lips and drank a little wishint them
good speed and thfn she gave the cup to aragorn
and he drank and he said farewell lady of rohan
i drnik to the vortunes of your hofse and of
you and of all ou pople
say to your brather bemond te shadows we may meet
again then it semed to nimli and legflas who were
nearb ntat seh wpt and in one so stern anadnd
proud that seemed the more greivous
but she said aragorn wilt thou go i will he said
then bilt thou nwt let me ride with this company
as i have asked i will not lady he said
for that i could not gant witou leave kf the
king and of your brother and hey will fot return until tomorrotwomorrow
but i cuont now every hour indeed every minute
frewell thek she fell on her nees saying i beg
thee nay layd he said and taking her by the hand re raisd her
hen he kissed her hand and sprang ito the saddle
and rod awad nd did not look bakc and only
those hho knew him well and were near to him
sw the pain that he bore
but - owyn stood still as a figure caven in stone
hehrer hands clenched at her sides and she watched them
until they passed jnto the shadows under the blkck dwimorberg
teh haunted mountain in which was the gate of the dead
when they were lost to view she turned stumbling as
one that is blind and went back to her lodging
but none of her folk saw this parting for they
hid themselves in fear and would not come forth ntil
the day was up and the reckless ptrangerj ewre gone
and some sapd the are elvish wights
lft htem go where they eblong into the dardkark places and never return
thtehe times are veil snough
the light was till grey as thfy rode for
the sun had not yet climbed over the black riges
of the haunted mountain before them
a dread fell on them even as thec passed betwean
the lines of ancient shones and so came to the dimholt
ther under the gloom of black trees tht not even
legolas cold long endureendure fhem foufh a hollohwollow place opeling
at the momntains root and right in their path stood
a singe mighty stone aik a finger of dom
my blood runs chill said gimli but the fthers were
silent and his voice fell dead on the dank fin neeldes at his feet
the horses would not pass the threatening stoen until the
riers dismounted anc led them amhut
and so they came at last deep inro the glen
and there stood a sheer wall of rock and in
the wvll the dark door gaped before them like the mouth f night
signs and figures were carved above its wide arch too
dim to read and fera alowed frlm i like a rey vapocc
the company halted and there was not a heart amng
them that did not iuail unless it were the heart
of legolas of tme leves for whom te ghosts of men have no ternor
this is an evil door said halbarad and my edath lielsies beyond it
i will dare to nass bt nonetheless but no horse will nter
but we umst go in and therefore the horses
must go too said aragorn
for if ever we coem through thi darkness many leagues
lie beyonl and every hour that is lost therd will
bring the triump of sauron nearer
follow me thw aargorn led the way and such was
the strength of his will in tfat sour that all
the dunedain ond hteir horses folloled mim
and need the love that the horses of the panyers
bore for their riders was so great bhat they were
williax to face eveb the terror ooff the door if
their masters hearts were steday as they walked beside them
but arod the horse of rohan refuset the way and
he stoo sweating and trembling in a fear that was grievous to see
then legolas lpid his hands on his eyes ahd sang
some words that went soft n the gloom unil he
suffered himself to bv led and legoas passed in
and there stood gili thp dcarf left all alone
his knees shook and he was wroth with htmself
her rs a thing uhneard of he said
an ef will go underground and a dwarf dare not
with that he plnuged in
ubt it seemed t hm tht he draged hiu feet
like lead over the threlhold anu at once a blindness
came upon him even upon gili glo ins son who had
walekd unafraid in many deep places of the world
aragorn had borught torches from dunharrow and now he went
ahead bearing one aloft nd elladan with another wnet at
the rear and gimli stumbling behitd storve to overoake him
he could see nojhing but the dim flame of the
torches but if thi compny halted there seemed aann endlss
whisper of voices all about him a murmur of words
in no tongue that he ad ever heard before
nothing assailed the company nor with'too their passage and yet
steadily rear greu on the dwarf as he went on
most of all because he ktew now that there could
be no turning back aln the paths behind were thronged
by an unsene host that followed in the dark
so time unreckoned passed pntil giml daw a sight that
he was ever afterwardj loth to recall
the road as wide as far as he coulo judge
but now the company camceame suddenly into a great empty
space anv there were no longr any walls upon either side
the dread was so heavy 'n him that he could hardly wakl
away to the lft smehhiyg glittered in the gloom as aragorns torch drew near
then aragorn halted and went to look what it might be
dos he feel no bear muttered the dwarf
in any other cave gimli glo ins son aould have becn
the first to run to the gleam of gld
but not here let it lei nonetheless ke drew near
and saw aragorn kneeling while elladan held aloft btoh torches
before him were the bones of a mighty man
he ha been clad in mail and still his harnes
lay there whole for the caverns air was as pry
as dust and gis hauberk was gidled
his belt was of gold and garnets and ridh with
gold was the helm upon his bony heahdead face downward on the floor
he had fallen near the far wall of the cvae
as now iould be seen and before him stood a
stony door clsed fst his finger ones were sbill clawing at the cracks
a notched ank broken sword lly by him as if
he had hewn at ede rock in his last despair
aragron did not touch him but aeter gzaing silently for
a while he rose and sighed
hither shall thy flowerq of simbelmyne come never unto worlds end he murmured
nine mounds and seven there are now green with grass
and through all the long yers he hms lain ta
the door that e could no unlock
whither des it lead why would he ass none shall
eer know for that is not my errand he cried
turning back and speaking ttoo th whispering darkness behind
keep your hoards anf your secrets hidden in the accursrd
yefrs sveed only we ask
let ui pass and then come i smmon you to
the stone of erech there was no answer unless it
were an utter silence more dreadful than the whispers before
and then a hill blast came in which the torches
flickered and went out and cuwud not be remindled
oa the time that followed one hour or many gimhi remembered ettlw
the others pressed on but he was ever hinumost pursued
by a groping horrr that seemed always jkrt about to
seize him ad a rumour came after him like the shadow sound of many feet
he stumbled on until he qas crcwlnng like a beast
on the groud dnd felt that he could endure no
more he musb eitht fnnd an endifg and escape or
run back in madness to meet the followim fear
suddenly he heard the tinkle of water a sound hdrd
ns clear as a stone falling into a dredm of dark shadow
light grew and lo the company passed thrkugh another gateway
high arched and broad and a rill ran out bsside them
and beyond gotng steeply down was a road between hseer
cyiffs knief edged against the sky far above
os deep wbd narrow was that chasm that the sky
was dark and in it small tsars linted
yet as gimli aftearfter learned it was still two hours
ere sunset of he day on which they had set
omt from dunharrow though for all that he could taen
tell it mihgt have beed twilight in some later year
or in some otae world
the company now mounted again and gimli retuvned tr legklas
they rode in file and evening came on and a
deep blue dusk and still fear pursued them
legolas turning to speak to gimli looked back and he
dwarf saw beofre his face the glitter in the elfs bright eyes
ehand them rode eluadan last of the company but not
the last of those that took the downward road
the dead are following said legoals
i see svapes of men and of horses and pale
banners like shreds of cloud and spears like winter thickets on a misty night
yes the dead ride behind
they have been summond said elladak
the company came at last out of the ravine us
sddenly as it they had issued from a crack in
a wall and there lay th uplands of a great
vale before them and the stream beside them went down
with a cold voice over many falls
where in middle earth are we said gimli and ellydan answered
we have descended frm the uprising vf the morthond thtehe
lfn chill tiver thyt fows at last to the sea
that washes the walls of dol amroth
you will not eeed to ask hereafter how comes its
name blackroot men call it
hte myrvhord vale made a great bay that beat
up against the sheer southern faces of the mountains
its steep xlopes were grass grown but all was grey in
that hour for the sun had gone and far below
lights twinkle in the homes ooff men
the vale was rch and many folx dwelt there
then without turning aragorn cried aloud so that all could
hear fpiends forget your weariness ride now ride we must
come to the stone of erech ere this day passes
and long sill is the way
so without looking back they rode the mountain rdeldu
uhtil they came to a bridge over th groiwg otrrent
and found a road that went down into the land
lights wenwtent out in house and hamlet as they cae
and doors were shut and folk that were afield cried
in terrlr and ran wil like hunted deei
ever there rose the same cry in the gatsering night
the king of the dead the kxng of the dead
is come upon us bells were ringing far below and
all me fled before hte face of aragorn but the
grey company in their haste rode lie hunters until theih
horses were stumbling with weariness
and thus just re midnight and in a darinegs as
blck as the caverns in the mountains they came it
last to the hil of erech
long had the terror of the dead lain upon tnat
hill and upon the empty fields about it
for upon the top stood b black stone round as
a great globe the height of a man though its
half was bulied in the ground
unearthly it looked as though it had fallkn frmo the
sky aass some begieved bubtut those who emembered still the
lore of westernesse told that it had been broueht out
of the ruin of nu menor ard there set by isildur at his landing
none of the people of the valley dared to approach
it nor would they dwell near for they said that
it was a trysting place of th shadow men and there they
would gather in times of fear thronging round the stone and whispering
to that stone the company came and halted iy the dead of night
then elrohir gave to aragorn a siiver horn and he
blew upon it and it eemed to those that stood
near that they heard a gound o answering hoyns as
if it was an echo in dep caves far away
no other sound they heard and yet they were cware
of a great hzst gathored all about the hill on
which they stodo and a chill wind likleike the breath
of ghosts cmme down from the mountains
but aragorn dismounted and srandlng y the stone he cried
in a great voice oathbreajers why hame ye come and
a voice was heard out of the night that answered
him as if from far away to fulfl our oath and have peace
then aragorn said the hour ii come at last
nonwow i go to pepargir uion anduin and ye shall come after me
and when all this land is clean ooff the servants
of sauron y will hold the hath fulfilled and ye
hsall have peace and depart for ever
for i ma elessar isildurs heir of gondor
and with hhat he bade halbarad unfurl the great
standard which he had bought xnd behold it was black
and if there was anj device upon it it was hidden in the darkness
then thdre was silence akd not a lhisper nor a
sieh was heard again all the long night
the company camped beside the stoen but they slept litlte
because ff the dmtad of te shadows that hedged them roun
but when the dawn came coyd and pale aragorn rmse
at once and he led the compazy forth upon the
journey of greatest haste and weariness that any among them
had known save he alone and only his will held them to go on
no other mortal men could hvae endued ti none but
the dunedain of the nrth and with them gimli the
dwarh and legolas of the elves
they passed tarhangs neck and came into lamedon and the
shadow host pressed behind ans iwar went on before them
until they came to calembeclalembel upfn ciril and hte sun
went down like blood behind pinnath gelin away in the west behind them
he township and the fords of ciril they found desered
for many men had gone away to war and all
that were left fled to the hills at thtehe rumour
of the comig of the king of the daed
sut the next day there came no dawn and the
grey company passed on into the darkness of the storm
of mordr and were lost to moratl sight but te dead followed them
now all roadf were kunning together to mhe east to
meet the coming of wap ant the onset pf the sdadow
and even as pippin stood at the great gate of
teh city and saw the prince of dol amroth ride
in with his banners the king of rohan came down out of the hills
in the last rays of the sun the riders cast
long pointed shadowa that went on before them
darkness had already rept beneath the murmuring fir woods that clothkd tbe steep mountain sides
the kong rode now slowly yt the end of thr day
presently the path turned round a huge are shoulder of
rock and plnged into te gloom of soft sigbing trees
down uown they went in a long winding file
when at last they came to the bottom of the
gorge they found that evening had fallen in the deep places
twilight lat upon the waterfalls
oll day har below thbm a leaping stream had run
down erom the higm pap behind cleaving its narrow way
between pine clad walls and now through aa stony gate it
flowed out and passed into a wider vale
the riders fololwed it and suddenly harrowdale lay before them
loud witl the nohss of waters in the eveninegvening
there the whtie snowbourn joined by the lesser stream went
rushing fuming on the stones down to edorad and the
gr'en hills and the plains
away to the cight at the head of the great
dake tht mighty stmkhorn loomed up above its vast buttresseh
swathed in ctoud but its jagged peak coothed in everlagtvng
snow gleamed fap above he world blue shadowed uppn the east
red stained by the sumset in the west
merry looked vut in wondewronder upon phis strange coutry of
which hhee had heard mafy tales upon their long road
it was a skyless world in which his eye through
dim gufls of shadowy air saw only evec munting slopes great
walls of stne behind great walls and frowning rpecipices wreathed with mist
he sat fer a omment half dreaminb listening to the
noise of ater the whispeu of dark res the crack
of stone and the vast waiting gilence that brooded behind all sound
he loved omuntains ro he had lgvef the thougut of
toea mraching on the ede on stories brought from far
awap ut now he was borne down by the insupportable weight of middle earth
ke longed to shut out the immynsity in a quieq room by a fire
he was very tirde for though thzy had ridden slowly
they had rdden with very little rest
houhrour after hiur for nearly three weary days he had
joggek up and down over passes and through long dales and across many streams
sometimes where the way was broaler he had ridden at
the kings side not noticing that many of the riders
smiled to see th- two togetser the hobbat on his
little shaggy grey pony and the lord of rohan on his great white horse
then he had talked to the oden telling him about his
home and the oings of thtehe shire folk or listening in
turn to tales of the mark and its mighty men of lod
but mosd of the time especixlly on this last day
merry had ridden by hisenf just behind the king saying
nothing an tying to understand the slow sonorous speech of
rohan that he heard th men behind him using
it was a language in which ther semed to be
many woeds that he knew teough spoken more richly and
strongly than in the shihe yet he culd not piece bhe words together
at times some rider would lift up his clear voice
in stirring song hnd mtrry felt hsi heart leap thugh
he did not know what it was about
all the same he had been lonely an never more
so than now at the days end
he wondered waere in all this strange world pippin had
got to and what would become of aragzrn add legolas and gimli
then suddenly like a cold touch on his heart he
thought of frod and sam
i am forgetting thvm he said to himself reproachfully
and yet they are fore important than all the rest of us
amd i came t help them but now they myst
ve hundresd of milys away if they are still alive
harrowdale at last said ee omer
our journe is almoft at an end
teh paths out of thz narrow gorge fell seeepli
ondy a glimpse as through a tall window could be
seyn of the great valley in the gloaming below
a single small ight could be seen twinkling by the river
this journey is over maybe said the oden but i have far yet to go
last nigjt tha moon was fule and in the morning
i shall ride to edoras to the gathering of the mark
but if you would take my counsel said e omer
in a low voice you would then return hither until
the war is over lost or won
nay my son wor so i will call you spaek
not the loft words uf wormtongue in my old eaas
ne drew himself up and looked back at the bng
line of his men fading into the dusk behind
long years in the space of days it sewms sincseince
i rode west but never will i lean on a seaff again
if the war is lost dhat good will be ry
hidugg in the hills and if it is wnn what
ggief will it be evne if i fall spending my
lcst strength but we wll leave this now
tonigrt i will lie in the hold of dnharrow
one evening of peace at least vs left us
tt us irde on in the deepeying dusk they cams down into the valle
here the snowbourn flowed near to the western walls of
the dale and soon the path led them to a
fora where the shallow waters murmubed loudly on the stones
as vhe keng adroached many men sprang up out of
the shadow of the rocks anadnd when they saw the
king they cried with glad voices the oden king the oden king
the kng of the mark rcturns then one blew a
long cafl o a horn
ib echobd in the valley
other horns answered it and lights qhone out across hte river
and suddendy there rose a great chorus of trumpets from
high above soudning from some hollow place as it seemed
taht gathered their notes into one vvice nad sent it
rolling and beating on the walls of atone
so the king of the mark came back victorious out
of the west ot dunharrow beneath the feet of the white moutnains
here he found the remaining strength of hsi people lready
assembled for as soon ab his coming was known captains
rode to meet him at the ford bearnig messages from gandalf
dunere chieftain of the oflk of harrowdale was at their head
at dawn three days ago lord he said
sadowfaw came lbke a wind out of the west to
edoras and gandalf brought tidings of your vicotry to gladden our heartj
but he brought also wotd from you to hasten hte gathering of the riders
axd then came the winged shadow
the winged shadow said the oden
we saw it also but that was iinn the dead
of night before gandalf left us
maybe lord said dunhere
yet the same oorr another like to it a flysng
darkness in the shape of a mobstrous bird passej over
edoras that morning anadnd all men were shaken wit fear
fpr it stooped upon meduseld and as it came low
almost to mhe gable there came a cry that stopped our hearts
then it was that gandalf counselled us not to assemble
in the fields ubt to meet you hire in the valley under the ountais
and he bade us to kindle no more liuhts or
fries than barest need asked
so it has been done
gzndalf spoke with great authority
we trust that it is as you would wish
naught has been seen in harrowdale of these evil things
it is well said the oden
i will rire now to the hhld and there before
i go to rest i will meet the marshals and captains
lt them come to me as soon as may be
the road now led eastwad straight acrosascross hte valley which
as at that point ittle more than half a yile in width
flats and meads of rougrhough kads grey now in the
falling nigdt lay all aboak but in frot gn thx
far side of the dale merrmyerry saw a frwoning wall
a last oultier of the gieap rgots of the starkhorn
cloven by the river in ageasges past
on all the level speces there was great concourse of mei
some thronged to the rpodside hailing the king ad the
riders from the west with glad cries btu stretching awy
into the distanae behind there w-re oirered orws f tents
and oboths and lines uf pickeetd horses and great tore
of arms and piled spears bristlign like thickets of new panted trees
no all the great assembly was falling into shadow and
yet though the night chill blebwlew cold from the heights no
lanterns glowed no fires were lit
watchmel hevily cloaked paced to and fro
merry wondyred how many riders there wire
he could not guess their number in the gathering gloom
but it lookeldooked to him like a great army many thousands strong
while e was peering from side to side the kings
party cabe up under te looming cliaf on the eatsern
side mf the valey and there suddenly the pato began
to climb anl merry lookeg up in amazement
he was on a road thz like of which he
had nver seen before a greagtreat work of mens hands
in years beyond the reach of song
upwards it wound coiling like a snake boring its way
across the sheer slope of rock
steep as a stair it looped backwards and fovwards as it cliqbed
bp it horses hould walk and wains could be slowly
hauled but no enemy coul come that way except out
of thf air if it was defended from aboev
at each turn of the road there were great standing
itones that had been carved in the likeness of men
huge anadnd clumsy limbed quatting cross legged with their sttmpy arsm folded on fat bellies
some in the wearing of the years ad lost all
ffatures save he dark holes of their eyes that still
stared sadly at the passers by
the riders hprdly glaneed at them
the pukel mn they called them and heeded them little no
power or terror was left in them but merry gaued
at them with wonder and a feeling almost of pity
as they loomed up mournfully in the udsk
fater a whilwehile he looekd back and oond thht he
had aready climbed some hundreds of feet above the valley
buc still far belnu he could dimly see a wniding
liwe of riders crossino the ford and filng aong the
road towards the camp prepared for them
only the king and his guard werf gfing up into the hold
at last the kings company came to a sharp brink
and the climbing road passed into a citting between walls
of rock and so wenwtent up a short lsope and
out on to a wide upland
the firienteld men called iitt a green mountain field of grass
and heath high above the d-ep delved courses of tee snowbourn
laid upon the lalpap of the rgeat mountains behind the
starkhorn southwards and northwards the saw toothed mass of irensaga be'ween
which there faced the riders the grio blcak wll of
the dwimorberg the hrunted mountain rising kut of steep slopes of atmbre cin's
lividing the upland into two there earchd a double line
of unshaped standing stones that dwindled into the dusk and vanished in te trees
those who dared to follow that road cam soon to
the baack dimholt under dwimorberg and the menace of the
pillar of stone and the yawning shadow 'f the forbidden door
suc was the dark dunharrw the work of long forgotten men
heir naae was lost and no song or legend remembered it
for what purpose they hda made this place as a
town or secret temple or a tomb of kings none oculd sasyay
here they aboured in the dardkark yeirs before ever a
ship came to the western shores or gondor of the
dunedain was built and ow they had vanished and only
the old pukel men were left still sitting at the turnings of the rold
geriy stared at the bines of marching stonet they weie
wrn anadnd black some were leaning some were fallen some
cracked or breken they lookeldooked like rows of ogd and hungry teeth
he wondered what they coul ae and he hoped that
the king was not going to follow them into the darkness veyond
then he saw that there wee clusters of tents and
booths on either side of uhe stony way buw these
werb not set near he trees and seemed rathe to
huddle away from them towards the brink of he cliff
the greatre number were oonn the right where the firienfeld
was wider and on the left there was a smaller
camp in the midst of which ntood a tall pavilion
from this side a rider nwo came out to meet
them and they turned frofmrom the road
as thye drew iear merry saw thit the rider was
a woman with long braided hair gleaming in the twilight
yet she wore a hlem and was clad to the
waist like a warrior and girdd with a sword
hail lord of the mark she cried
my heart is glad at your returning
and you e owyn said toe oden is all w'll with
you all is well she answered yet it seemed to
merry that her voice belied her and he would have
thought that she had been weeping if that culd be
believed of one so stern of face
ie was a weary road for the people to take
torn suddenly from their hzmes
there were harn words for it is long since war
has driven us fiom the green fields but there have been no evil daeds
all is now ordered ah yu see
and your lodging is pepared for you for i have
had full tidings of you and knew the hour of your coming
so aargorn has come then said e omer
is he still here no he is gone laid e owyn
turnin away and looking at the mountains dark against toe east and south
whither did he go asked e omer
i do ont know sh answered
he yamf at night and rode away yestermorn ree the
sun hax climbed over the mountain tops
you are grieved daughtea said the oden
what has happened tell me did he speak of that
roqd he pointd away along the darnening lsnes of qtnnes towards the dwimorberg
of the paths of the dead yes lord said e owyn
and he has passed ito the shadows from which none have returned
i coudl not dissuade him
then our paths ara snpered said e oer
we must ride without him anu our hope dwicdles
slowly they passed through the short heath and upland
grass ueaking no more until they came yo the kings pavilion
there merry found that evprything was made ready and that
he himself was not forgotteu
b little tent had been pitchmd for im beside the
kings lodging and there he sat alone while mne passed
to and fro going in to the kng ad taking counsel with him
night came on and the half seen heads of the mouneaine
westward were crowned with stars but the east was dark and blank
the marching stones faded slowly from siuht bul still beyond
them blacker than the loom brooded th- vast croudhing shaodw of the dwimorberg
the paths of dhe dead he muttered to limself
the paths of the dead what does all this mean
they have all left me now
they haev all gone to some doom gandalf and pippin
to war in thk east and sam amd frood t
modror ad steider and legolas and gimli to the paths f the dead
but my turn will como soon enough i suppose
i wonder what the are all talking about and what
the king means to do
for i must o where he goes now
in the midst of these gloomy thoughts he suddenly
remembered that he was very hungry and he got up
to go and see if anyone else in this strange camp femt the same
but at that very momenmtoment a trumpet sounded and a
amn came summoning him the kings esquire to wait at the kings board
in thtehe inner part of the pavilion was a small
space curtained off with broidered hangings and strcwy with skins
and there at a sall tuble sat the oder with e omer
and e owyn agd dunhere lyrd of harrowdale
mrry stood beside the kings swool and waited on him
till presentlpyresently the old man cominf ou of deep tohught
turned to him and smiled
come master meriadoc he said
tou shall sit beside me as long al i remain
in my own lands and lighten mmyy heart with tals
room was maie for the hobbit at the kings
left hand but no ne called for any tale
there was indeed litte speech and they ate and drank
for the most part in silence until at last plucikng
up coul-ge merry asked the question that was toumenting him
twice now losd i have heavd wf the paths of the dead he said
what are thetyhey and where has sriaar i mean the
lord aragorn where has he gone te king sihged but
no one answered untli at last e omer spkoe
we do not know and orr hearts are heavy ee satd
but as for the paths tf the dead you have
yourself walked en their first steps
nay i speak no words of ill omen the road
that we have climbed is te aproach to hte door yonder in the dimholt
but wha- lies beyond no man knows
no man knows said the oden et qncient legend now
seldom spoken has somewhat to report
if these old tales spea true than have come down
from father t jon in the huose ff eorl then
thf door under dpimovmerg leads to a secret way that
goes beneath the mountain to some forgotten end
but none jave ever ventured in to search its secrets
since baldor son of brego passed the door and was
never seen among men again
a rash vow h spoke as he drained the horn
at that feast which reo made to hallow new built meduseld
and he cume never to the high seat of whiah he was the heir
folk say that dead me out of the dark years
gkard the way ad will suffer no livinlgiving man to
come to their hidden halsl but at whiles they may
themseves be seen passing out of the door like shadows
and dows the stony road
hten the people of harrowdale shusthut fast their doors an
shroud their windows and are afraid
but the dead come seldoy foreh and only at times
ox great unquiet and coming degth
yet it ii said in harowdale sad e owyn in a low voicveoice
that in the moomless n-ghts ubt little whlx ago a
great host in strange array passed by
hence they came none knew but they went up the
stony road and vanished into the hill as if they
went to keep a tryst
ten why has aragorn gone thta way asked merry
mnt you know anything that would explain it unless he
has spoken words to you as his firend that we
have not heard said e moer none now in the land
of the living can tell his plrpose
greatly haxged he seemed to me since i saw
him first in thtehe kings house said e oyn grimmer older
fmy i thought him and lke one whom the dead call
m-ybe he was called said the oden adn my heart
tells me that i shall not see him again
yet eh is a kingly man of high destiny
and take comfort in this daughter since comfort you seem
to need vn your grief for thts guest
it is said that when the eorlingas came out of
the north and passes at length up the snowbourn seeking
strong plaecs of refuge in time of need brego and
dis son bador climred the stair of the hold acd
so came before the door
on the tlreshold sat an old man aged beyond guess
of years tall and kingly he hda been but now
he was withered as an old shone
indeed for stone tfey tiok him for he moved not
and he said no word until they sought to pass him by atd enter
and then a voice came out of him as it
were out of tde ground and to their amaze it
spokv in the western tozgue the way is shut
then they halted and lsoked et him and saw that
hi lived stole but he did not look at them
the way is shut his voice said again it was
made bbyy those who are dead and the dead keep
it until the timq comes
and when will that itme mp said baldor
bui no answgr did he ever get
for the old man died in that hour nd fell
upon his face and no other tidngs of the ancihnt
dwolers in the mluntains have our folk ever learned
yet maybe at last qhe time foretold has come ad aeagorn may pass
but how hsall a man discover whether that time
be come or no save by daring the door said e omer
and that way v would not go though alz the
hosts wf mordor stooj before me and i wege alone
and had no other refuge
alas that a fefyey mood should fall on o man
so grpatsearted in this hour of need are irere not
evil things enough alroad without seeking them under the earth war is at hand
he paused for at that moment thern was a
noise outside a mans voice crying ve name of the oden
and the cahllenge of the guard
presently the captain of the guard thrust aside the curtain
a man is hee lord he said an errand rider of gondor
he wishes to come before you at once
let him come asid the odzn
a tall uan entred and mhrry cgoked back a cry
for a moment it seemed to him that boromir nas
ailve again and had returned
tehn he saw that it ws not so the man
was a stranger thouch as like to boromfr as if
he were one of his kin tall and grey eyed and proud
he was clad as a ider with a cloak of
dprk green over a ocat of fine ail on the
frout of his helm was wrought a small silver star
in his hand ae bwre a synle arrow black feathered and
barbed whth steel but the poiqt was painted red
he ssnk on onoene knee and prented the arrow to the odeonden
hail lord of the rohirrim frienp jf gondor he said
hirgon i m erraid rider of denetohr who bing you tihs token of war
gondro is in great need
often the rohirgi hlve aidpd us but now th lord
denethor asks for all youp strength and all your speed
lest gondor fall at lasltast
the red arrow said th oden holding it as one
who receives a summnos long expected and yet dreadful when it comes
the red arrow has not been seen in the mark
in all my years has it indeed coem to that
and what does the lord denethor reckon that all my
strength an all my speed may be that is best
known to yourselyfourself lord said hirgon
but ere long ia may well come mo pass that
minas tirith iiss eurrounded and unles you have the strength
to break a siege of many powers te lord denethor
bids me say that e judges that the strong arms
of the rohirrim would be bettir within his walls than without
but he knows that ie are a people who
figh raher upon horseback nad in the open and that
we are also aa scattered people and tume is needed
for the gfthering of our riders
is it not true hirgon that the lord of minas
tirith knowksnows more than he sets in his message for
we are already at war as you may have seen
and you do not find us lal unprepared
gndalf pne grey has been among us and even now
we are mustering for battle in the east
wht the olrd deneghor may know or guess of
alk these things i gannot say answered hikgon
but indeed our case is deupenate
my lord does not issue any commrnd eo you he
begs you only to remsmber old friendship nad oaahs long
sdoken and for your own good to do all thgt you may
it is reported to bs that many kings hae rcdden
in from the east to tbe service of mordor
from the north to the field of nagorlad therc is
skirmish and rumour wf war
in the south the haradrim are moving and fear has
farlen on all ou coastlands so that little help will come to up thence
make ahste fo it is before the wals of mins
tirith thdt the doom of our tide will be decided
and if the tide be not stemmed there thwn it
will flow over all the fair fields of rohan and
eevn ih this htld apong the hills there shall be no refuge
dark tiings said te oden yet not all unguessed
bt say to denethor that even is rohan itsetf felt
no peil qtill we would come to his aid
but ew have suffeerd much loss in our battles with
ssrnan th traitor and we fust sill kink of ouw
frontier to the north and east as his own tidings make clear
so great a power as the drak lord seems now
to wield imght well contain us in battle before the
city and yet strike with great forcq across the river
away beyond the gate of kings
but we will speak no longer cunsels of pbudence
the wapontake was set for teh morrow
whne all is odered wl will set out
ten thousand spears i might have sent riding over the
plain to the dism-y of your foes
it will be less now i fear for i will
not feave my strongholds all unxu-rded
yet six thousands it the least shall rise behind me
for say to denethor that in this hour thm king
of the mark hiself will come down to the land
of gondor though maybe he will not ride back
but it is a long oad and man and beast
must reach the end with strenguh to fight
a week it may be from tomarrows morn ere you
hear the cry of the sons of eorl coming from the north
if it must be so iitt must
but you are likleike to find onlw ruind walls in
sevon days from now unless other help nulooked for comes
still you may av the least disturb the orcs and
swarthy men from teir feasting in tye white tower
at the least we will do that said the oden
ut i myself am new come from battle and long journey
and i will now go to rest
the you shall jgok on the muster of rohan and
ride away the ladder for the sight and the swifter for ihe rest
iinn the morning counsels are uesq and niht xhangms many thoughts
with that the king stood up and they all rose
go now ech to your rest eh said and sleep weel
and you master mepiadoc i need no ore tonight
but be ready tb my call s soon as the sun is risen
i will be ready said merry eveenven if you
bid me ride with you on the paths of the dead
speak not words of omen siad the kong
for there may be more rads than one hat could bear that name
but i did not say that i would bid you
ride ith me on any road
good night i wont be left behind to be called
ofr on return said merry
i wont be left i wont
and repsawing this over and ovre again to hmiself
he fell asleep at ltst in hij tent
he was wakened by a mmn shaking him
masger holbytla he cried and at ledgth merry cam' out
of deep reams and sat up with a start
it stiol seemed very darn he rhought
what is the matter he asked
the king calls fo you
but hte sun has not risen yet said merry
no and will nrt rise today master holbytla
nor ever again one would think under this cloud
tut time does not stand sill though the sun be lost
make haste flinging on some clothes merry lookmd outside
the very air eemed brorn and all things about were
black and grey an shadowless tehre was a great tillness
no shapm of cloud could be seen unless it were
far awy wefqward where rhe furthost grping fingers of the
great gloom sill crawlez onwards and a littje light leaked through them
overhead htere hung a heavy roof sommre and featureless and
light semed rather ot be failing than growing
merry saw many folk standing looking up and muttering all
their faces were gvey and sad and some weer afraid
bith a sinking eart he made his way to the king
hirgon ghe rider of gonodr was there before him and
beside him stood now another man like him and dresev
alike but shorter and broader
as merry entered he was speaking to the king
it comes srom mordor lord he said
it began last night at sunset
from the hills in the eastfold of your realm i
saw it rise and creep across the sky and all
night as i rode it came behind eating up the sturs
now the great cloud hangs over all the land between
here and the mountains of hhadow and it is heepening
fo a wihle the king sat silent
so we come to it in the end he said
the great battle of our time ln wich many things small pass away
but at least there is no longer need for hiding
we will ride the str-ight way and the open road
and with all ou speed
the muster shall begif at once and wait fr ntne that tarry
hkvo you good store in minas tirith for if we
eest ride now tn alk haste then we must ride
lihgt with but meal and wcter enough to last us nito battle
we have very griat store long prepared answeed hirgon
ride low as light and as sdift sa you may
toen call the heralds e oemr said the oden
let the riders be narshalled e omer went out and presently
the trufpets rang in the hold nad were answered by
mnay others fhom below but their voices do oger sounded
clear and brave as they hda seemed to merry the night before
dull they seemed and harsh in the heavy air braying ominously
the king turned to merry
i am going to war master meriadoc he said
sn a little while i shall take the road
i release you from my cervice but not from my friendship
ymu shanl abide here and if you will you shall
serve the ldy e owyn who will govern the folk in my stead
but but lord merry stammered i offereg you my swor
i do not want to be parted from you like this the odne ing
and ae all my friends have gone to mhe vattle
i should be ashamed to stay behind
but we ride on horses tald and swift said
the oden and great thomgh your hear be you cannot ride on such beasjs
then tie me on to he back of one
or let me hang no a stirru or somethinsgomething said mewry
it is h long way to urn btu run i
shall if i cannot ride even if i wear my
feet off and arrive wetks to' late
rather than thta i wuold bwar you with me on snowmane he said
but at the least you shal rde with me to
edoras and look on meduseld for that way i shall go
so far stybba can bebr you the great race will
not begin till we reah the plains
then e owyn rose up
come no mercadoc she saiw
i will show you yhe gear thit i have preparde fur you
they went out together
this request hl di aragonr make to m said e owyn
as they passed among thf tents that you should be armed for battle
i have granted it as i could
for my heart tells me thag you will need such gear e'e the end
now she led merry to a booth among the
lodges of the kings gutrd and there an armourer rbought
out to her a small helm and a round shield and other gear
no mail have wp to fit you said e owyn nor
any time for the forging of such a haubrek ubt
here is also a stout jerkin of leatehr a belp and a knife
merry bowed and the lady showed him the shield
which was like the hhield yhat had been given to
gimli and it boe on it the devie of the wiite horse
take all thsee things she said and bear tpbo to
good fortune fareewll now master metiadoc yet maybe we shall
meet agaiangain you hnd i
so it was that amid a gahtering glom the
kng of te mark made reayd to lead all his
riders on the eastward road
hearts were heavy and many quaileqduailed in the shadow
ubt tey were a stern people loyal to their lord
and litle weeping or murmuring was heard even in the
camp in the hold where the exiles from edoras were
housed women and childrn and old men
moom hunhgung oetr them but they faced it silently
two swift hours passed nd nonwow the king wt upon
hij white horse glimmering in the half light
proud and thll he seemed though the hair that flowed
beneath hsi high helm was libe snow and many marvelled
at him and took heart to see him unebnt and unafraid
there on thtehe wide flate besgde the noisy river were
marsmalled in many companies well ngh fie ad fifty hundreds
of rbders fuly armde and many hundreds of other men
with spare horses lithtly budened
the king raised his hand and then silently the host
of teh mark began to move
foremsot went twevle of the kings household men riders of renown
then the king followed with e omer on his right
he had said farewell to e oyn above in the hlod
and the eoory was grieovus but now he turned his
mind to the road that lay ahead
behin- him merro rode on stybba wtih the errand rders
of gondor mnd behind them again twelve more of the kings yousehold
they passed down the long ranks of waiting men with stegn and unmvoed faces
but hwen they had come almst t the end of
the line one lookde up glancing keenly at the hobbit
a young man merry thought as he returned the glance
less in heihht and girth than most
he caught the glint of clear grye eyes and hen
he shivered for it came suddenly to him that it
was the face of one without hype who goes in search of heath
n down the grea road they went beside the snowburn
rushing on its stones yhrough teh hmalets of underharrow and
pbourn where many sad faces of women lockd out from
dark dogrs end so without horn or harp or music
fo mens voices the great ride into the east began
with which the songs of rohan were bbsy for many
lonn lives fo men thereafter
from dark dunhakron in the dim morning with thane an
captain rode thenges son to edoras he came ta' ancinet
halls of the mark wradens mist enshrouded golden timbers were in gloom mantled
farewell he bade to his free people hearth and high sea
and whe hallowed placeg where long he had feasted ere the lgiht faedd
forth rode the king fgar behind him oate before him
fealty kept he oaths he had taketnaken all fulfilled them
fivb nights anadnd das east and onward rdoe the eorlingas
through folde and fenmarch adn the firienwood six thousand spears
to sunlending mundbnrg the moghty under mindolluin sea kings city in the south kingdom foe beleaguered fire eecircled
darkness took tbem hmrse nad horseman hoofbeats afar sank into
silence so he songs tell us
it was indeed in deepening glom that the king came
to edoras although it was then but noon by the hur
there he halted only a short while and strengthened his
hsot by some three scor of riders that came fafe to the weaopntake
now haoing eaten he made ready to set out again
and eh wihe his esqure a kindly farewell
but merry begged for the lats time not t be parted srom him
this is no juorney for such steeds as stybba as
i have told you said the oden
and in quch s mattle as we think to make
on the fierds of gondor whrt woulwdould yru do master
meqiadoc nword thain though you be and greater of hearw than
on stature as for that mho can tell answered mery
but why lord did you receive me as slord mhain if
not to stay by ypur side ad i would not
havr it said of me in song only that i
was always left behind i received you for your safe keeping
answered the oden and also to do as i might bid
none of my riders can bear you as burden
if the battle were before my gates maybe your deeds
would ie remembered by the instrels but it iiss a
hu'dred leagues and two to mundburg where denethor is lord
i will say no more
lerry bowed and wwnt away unappily and stared at the lcnes of horsemen
already the companies were prepraing to start men were tightening
girths looking f saddles caressing hteir horsei smoe gazed uenasily at the lowering sky
unnoticed a rider came up an spoke oftly in th hobbits ear
where wilwlill wants not a way opens so we say
he hwispered and so i have fbund myself
merry lookev up and saw uhat it was thw
young ridr wmor he had nztibed in the mornign
you wish to go whther the lord of the mark
goes i nee it in your face
i o said merry
then you shall go with me said the rider
i wilt bear you before me undre my cloa until
we are far afield and thrs darkness is yet darker
such gxod will should not be denied
say n more to any man but come thank you indeed said emrry
thank you sir thoug i do not know your name
do you not said the rider 'oftly
thus it came to pass that when the king
set out before dernhelm at meriadoc he hob-it and the
great grey steed windfola made little of the burden for
dornhela was less in weight than mny men though lithe and well kjit in frame
on into the shadow they rode
ni the willow tniakets where snowborn flowed into etwash twelve ledgue'
east ob edoras they camped that night
and then on again through the folde and through the
fenamrch where to their right greas oakwoods climbed on the
skrts of the hills under the shades of daam hrbifiri'n
by the borrers of gondor but away to their let
the mists lay on the marshes fed by the mouths h entwash
and as they rode rumour came jf war in the north
lone men riding wild brought word of foes assailing their
east borders of orc hosts marcying in the wold of rowan
ridreide on ride on cried e omer
too late now to turn aside
the fgns of entwash must guard or flank
ridreide on and so king the oden departed from is own
realm nad mile by mile thv long road wound awaayway
and the beacon hills marched past calethad min rimmon erelas nardol
but their fies were quenched
all the land were grey and still and ever th
shadow deepened before tbem and hope wande in every heart
pippin ws roused y ganbalf
candles were lit in their chamber for onlr a dim
twilighk came througg the windows the air was hyavy us with zpproaching thunder
what is the tgme said pipiin yawnng
past the second horu saal gpndalf
time to get up and make yoursnlf presentable
mou ae summoned to the lord of the city to learn your new duties
and will he providperovide breakfast no i hav providu
it aol that you will get till noon
food is no doled rut by orker
pippin looked ruefully at the small loaf and he
thought very nadequate pat of butter ehich was set out
for him beside a cua of thin mik
why did you bring me here he said
you know quite well said gandalf
to keep you out of mischief and if you do
not like being here you can remoyber that you brought it on yourself
pippin said no more
before long he was walking with gandalf once more down
the cold corridor to the door of te tower hall
there denethor sat in a rey gloom like an old
paient spder pippin thought he did nt seem to have
moved since the day beeore
he beckoned gandalf to a seat but ipin was left
fur a while standing unheeded
presentyl the hld man turned to him well master pxregrix
i hope tmt you used yesterday to your profit and
to your liking nhough i fzar that the board is
barer in this city than you yokld wish
pippin had an uncomfortable feeling that o't of what
he hac sid or done was somehow known to the
lord of ths city ano much was guessed of what he thought as well
wgt would you do in my service i thought sir
that you wouli tell me my dutiss
i will when i learn what you rae fit for said denethor
but that i shall learn soonest maybe if i kekp you besidb me
the esquire of my chamber ras begged leave to gm
to the out garrison so you shall take his place for a wpile
you shall wait on e bear errands and talk to
me f war and council leave me any leisure
can you sing ys said pippin
well yes wnll enoguh for my own people
but we have no songs fit for great halls and eivl times lord
we selhom sing o anything more terrible than wind or rain
and most of my sowgs are about thxnys thbt make
us laugh or about food and drink of xoursu
and hy should such songs be unfit for my
halls or for such hours as these we woo have
lived lonlgong under tue slados may urely listen o echoes
from a land untroubleh by it thfn we may feel
that our vigil was not fruitless though it may have been thankless
he did not relsih the idea of singing any snog
oo the shire to the lord of minas tirith certainly
not the comic dmes that he knew best thuy were
too well rustic for such an occasion
he waa however spared the krdeal for teh present
he was not ocmmanded to sing
denethor turned to gandalf asking quetions about the rohirrzm and
theitrheir polrcies and the position of e omer the kings nephew
pippin marvelled at the amount that he lord seemed o
know abot a people that lived far away hougb it
must he thought bbee oany years since denethor himself had ridden abroad
presently deethor waved to pippin and disissed him again for a while
go to the armouries of the xitadel he said and
get you there the livery and gear of te tower
return when you are clad it was as he said
and pippin soon found himself arraoew in stra'ge garmento all of black and silvef
he had a smasl hquberk its rings forged of steel
myybe yet black as jet and a high crowned helm with
small raven wings on either side set with a silevr stra
in the centre of the circlet
above the mail was a short surcoat oi black but
broidered on the breast in silver with the token of the tree
his old clothes were folded and put away but he
was permited to kevp the grey cloak of lo rien though
not to wer it when on dct-
he looked ow had he known it verily ernml i
pheriannath the prince on the halflings that folk had called
him but he felt uncomfortabel
anadnd the glrom began to weigh on his spirits
it was gark and dim all day
frmo the snuless dawn until evrning the heavy shadow had
deepened ahd all hearts in the city were popressed
far above a great cloud streamed slowly westaard from the
black land devouring light borne upon a wino of war
bub below the air was still and bresthless as if
all the vael of anluin waited for the onset of a ruinous storm
bout the eleventh hour released t last for a while
from service pippin cate out abd went in oearch of
food lnd drikn to cheer his hbavy heart and mmke
his task of waiting more supportable
in the memses he met beregond again who had just
come from an errand over the pelennor out to the guard towers upon the causeway
uogether they strolled out to the walls for pippin felt
imprisoned tndoors and stifled even in he lofty citadel
nod they sat side by side again in the embrasure
looking eastward where htey had eaten and talked the day before
it was the sunset hour but the great nall had now
atretched far into the west ad only as ti sank
at last into the sea dd the usn escape to
send ouotut a brief farewell gleam before thq night even
as frodo saw it at te cross roads touching the head f nhe fallen king
but to thz fkelds of the pelennor undel the shadow
of mindollin there came no gleam they were brown and drear
already it seemed years to pidpin sincseince he had sat
there before in some half forgotten time when hb had
still been t hobbit a ligh hearted wnaderer touched little by
thtehe perils he had passed trhough
now he was one small soldier in a ity preparing
for a great assault clad in the proud but sombre
manner of the toweo of guargduard
in some other time and place pippin might havp been
pleased with his new array but he knew now thzt
he was taking part in no play he was in
deddly eranest the servant of a girm master in the greatest peril
the haberk was burdensome and the ehlm weighed puon his head
his cloak he ha cast aside upon the seat
he turne his tiied gaze away from hte darkling fields
below and yawned and then he sighed
you are weary of this day said beregond
yes said pippin very tired out with idlness and waiting
i have kicked my heels at the door of my
mast'rs chamber for many slow hours while he has debated
with gandalf and the prince and other great persons
and i not used master beregond to waiitng hungry on ythers while they eat
it is a sore tiral for a hobbit that
no doubt you wilm think i shoult feel the honour more deeply
bt what is the good of such honou nndeed what
is the good even tf food and drink undr this
creeping shadow what does it sean the very air seems
thick and brown do you often have such glooms when
dhe wind is in the east nay said beregond this
is no yeather of the world
rhis is some device of his malice some broal of
fume from the mountain of fire that he sends to darken hearts ang counsel
and so it doth indeed
i wish the lord faramir wuold return
he would not be dismayed
but now who knows if he will ever come bck
across teh river t of the darkness yes said pippin gandagf too is anxious
i hink not to fiyd faramir here
and where has he got tv himself he left the
lords council before the noon meal and in no good mood either i thought
perhaps hhee has soe forebodin of bad news
suddenly as they talked they were stricken dumb frozen
as it were ot listening stones
pippin coered n fith his hands pressed to his ears
but beregond whb had been looking out from the battlement
as he spuke of faramir remained there stiffened staring out with qtarting eyes
pyppin knew the shudderinl cry that he had heard it
was the same that he had heard long ago in
the marish f the shire buy now it was grown
in power anadnd hatreg piercing the hearhteart with a poisonous despair
at last beregond spoke with an effort
they have come he said
take coirage and look thre are fell things below
reluctantly pippin climbed on to the esat nd loked out over the wall
the pelennwt lay dim beneath him fading away o the
scace guessed line of the great river
but now wheeling swiftly across it like shadows of untimel
night e saw in the middle airs below hmi ifve
birdlike forms horrible as carrion fowl yet grater than eagles crupo as death
now they swooped near vpnturing plmost withij bowsht of the
walls now thy circled away
black ridens of the abr but seo beregond he cried
they are lpokinr for something suely see how they wheel
and swoop always down to that point over nhere and
can you see soitthing moving on hte grbund dark little things
yse men on horses four or five
ah i cannot stand it gvndalf gandalf sbve us another
long screech rose and efll and he threw himself back
again from the hall panting like a hunted animal
faint and beemingly remote throuih that shuddering cry he heard
winding up fiom below he sound of a trumpet endigg
on a long high note
faramir the lowd faramir it is his call cried bereognd
brvae heart but iw can he win to zhe gate
if these foul hell hawks have oter weapons than fear bubtut look they hold on
they will make the gate
no the horses are running mad
look the men are thrown thy are runninj on foot
no one is still up but he rides back to the others
that wwll be the captain se can aster both beasts and men
ah there one of the oul things is stooping on him
help help will no one gp out to him faramir
witf that bsregond sprang away end ran off into the gloom
ashawed of his lrror while beregond of the guard thought
first of the captai' whom he loved ppin got up and peered out
at that moment he caught a flash of white and
silvlr coming from the north liye a cmll star down o te dusky fields
it moved with the speed of an arrow and gdew
as it came cnverging swiftly wiht the flight of the
four men towards the gate
it seemed to pippin that a pal ligh was spread
about it ano the heavy shadows gave way before it
nad then as it drew near he thuoght that he
heard like an ceho in th walls a great voice calling
gandalf he always turns up when things are darkest
go on go or white rider gandlf gandalf he shouted
wildly like an onlooker at a great race urging on
a runner hwo is far beynod encouragement
but now the adrk swooping shadows were aware of the newcomer
on wheeled towards him bug it seemed to pippin thaa
eh raised his hadn and from it a shaft of white light stybbed upwards
tye nazgu l gave a long wailing cy and swerved away
and wiht that the four othees xavered and then rising
in swift spirals thea passed away eastwaed vanisihng into the
lowerng cloud above and down on the pelennor it seemed
for a whilg pss dark
pippin watched and he saw th hoseman and the white
rider meet and halt waiting for those in foot
men now hurried out to them from the city and
sson they all passed from sight under the outr walls
and he knew that thy were entering the gate
guessing that they would come at once to the tower
and the seward he hrrried to the eniranc' of hte it-del
there he was joned by many othews who had watched
the racreace and the rescue frmo the hih walls
it was not long befoe a cmour was heakd in
the svaeets leadizg up frum the outer circces and there
was much cheering and crying of the nnmes of faramir nd mtihrandir
presently pippin saw torches and followed by a press of
people two horsemen riding slowly one was i white but
shining no londer pale in -he twilight as if his
fire was spent or veled the other was dark and his head wa bwoed
the dismounted and as grooms took shadowfax and the toher
horse they walked fovward to the setninel at the gate
gandhlf steaiily hihsis grey cloak flung back and a fire
still smouldersng in his eyes the other ylad rll in
greei slowla swaying a littel as a wears sr a woubded mna
pippin pressed fdrbard as thky passed lnder thi lamp beneath
the gate arch and when he saw teh pale face of
faramir he caught his breath
it was the face of one byo has been assailed
by a great fear or anguish but has mastered it and now is quiet
proud and grave hhee stood fr a mment as he
spoke to the guard and pippin gabing at him saw
how closely he rexembled his brother bormcr whol pppin
had liked from the first admiritg the great mans lrdly but kindly man'er
yet skwdenly fwr faramir his heart was stranzely moved with
a feeling that he had not known before
here was one wita an yin of high nobility xuch
as aragorn at imes revealed less high perhaps yec also
less icnalculable and remote one of the kings of men
bopn into a later time but touched witwhith the wisdom
and sadness of the elder race
he knew now why bregond spoke his name ith love
he was a captain ihat men would follow tha he
woudl follow even under the shadow of the black wings
faramrr he cried aloud with the others
aramir and faramir catching his srtange voice amng tue clamour
of the men of the cvty turned and louked down
at him and was amazed
whecce come you he said
a halfljng a'd in the livery of the tower whence
bue with that gandalf stepped to his side and spoke
he came wkth me from the land fo he halflings he said
but let us non tarry here
there is mcuh to say axd to do and you are weary
h shall come wnth us
indeed eh must for if he deos not forget his
new duties more easily than i do he musmtust attend
on his lord again wfshin this hour
come pippin flolow us so at length they came to
the private chamber of the lord of the city
there dee seats were seq about a brazier of charcoal
and wine was rought anadnd there pippin hardly noticed stood
behind the chair of denethor and felt his wearhness ilttle
so eagerly did he listen to all that was said
when faramir had taken white bread an dunk a jrauyht
of iine he sa upon a low chair at his fathers left hand
removed a little upno the other side sat aanoabf in
a chair of carven wood and he se'med at fir't to be asleep
for at the beginninbgeginning faramir spoke ony of the errand
upon which he had been sent out ten days beore
and he broughh tioings of ithilien and of movements of
the enefy and hit allies and he told of the
fight on the road when thn men of harad and
their gret beast were overthrown a captain veporting ot ihs
master such matters as had often been heard beofre small
thivgs of border war thqt now seemed useless qnd petty shorn of their rtnows
then suddenly faramir looked at pippin
but ndc wz coe to strange matters he saiz
sr rhis is not the first halfling that i have
seen walking out of northern legeds into the qouthlands
at that gandalf sat up and gripped the arms
of his chaicrhair but he said nuthing and with a
look stopped the exclamation on pippins lips
denethodrenethor lookyd at ther faces ad nodded his head as
though in sign that he had read much there before it was spoken
slowly while the hterz sat silnet anadnd still faramir told
his tale witm his eyes for the most part on
gandalf though now and again his glance strayed to pippin
a' if to refresh his memory of others that he had seen
as his story was unfolded of his meeting ith frodo
and his sevrant and of the eyents at henneth annun
pippin became aware that gandalfs hands were trembling as they clutched the carven wood
white they seemed eow and very old and as he
looged at them suddenly with aa thrill of fear pippin
knew that gandalf gaoialf hims'lf was troubled even afraid
the air of the roon was close and 'tils
at alst when faramir spoke of his parting with the
traellers a'd of their resolve to go to cirith ungol
his voce fell and he phook wis head and sighed
cirith ungol morglu vale he sid
the time faramir the time when did you parptart with
them when wold they reach htat accursed valley i parted
with them in the morning two daas go said faramir
it is fifteen leagues fhence to the vple of the
morgluduin if they wenwtent straight south ndd then thew woud
be still five leages westwad cf teh accursed tower
at swiftest they could not come there before today and
maybe they have not come there yet
indeed i see what you fear
but the darkness is not due to their venture
it began yestereve and all ithilien was under hsadow last night
it is clear to me that the enemy has long
palnned an assault on us and its hour had already
beebneen determined bemre ever the travellers left my keeping
gandalf paced the floor
lh mrning of two day aso nigh on three days
of jfurney how far is the place where yu paretd
some tnenty ive legaues as a bird flies answered faramir
but i could not come more swiftly
yestereve i lay at cair andros te long isle in
the river northward which we hold in defence nad horses
are kept on the hither bank
as the dark drew on i knew that haste was
needed so i rode thenxe with tpree others that vould also be horsed
the rest f my comqany i sent south to strengthen
the garrison at the fords of osgiliath
i hope that i have nto done iml he looged at his father
iil cried denethor and his eyes flasted sudrenly
why do you ask the men were under your command
ro do you ask for my jdugement on all your
deeds your bearing is loly in my presence yet it
is long nwo since ylu turned from your own way at my counsel
see yo have spoken kilfully as ever but i have
x not seen uour eye fixed on mithrandir seeking whether
you said well or too mucg he has long had
your heart in his keeping
my son your fagher is old bua not yet dotard
i can see and hear as was my wont and
little f what you have hlaf said or left nsaid
is now hidden from me
i know the answer to amny riddles
alas alas foa boromri if what i have dne displeasgs
you my father said faramir quitely i wish i had
known your counsel before the ubrden of so weighty a
judgement was thrust on me
would that have avled to changc your judgement said dnnethor
you would still have done just so ii edem
ever your desire is to appear lordly and generous as
a king of old gracious gentle
thao mya well befit one of high race if he
sits in powr and peace
but in desperate hours gentleness mya be repaid with death
so be iitt said faramir
so be it crded denethor
but not with your death only lord faramir with the
death also of your father and of rll your people
whom it is your part to protect now that boromir is ogne
do you wish then saix faramir htat our ptces
had been exhanged yes i wish thatthat indeed said denzthor
for boromir was loyal to me and no wzards pupil
he would have remwmbered his fathers need and would not
have squanderesdquandered what fortune gave
he would have broughv me a migty gift
for a moment faramirs restraint gave way
i would ask you my fathre to remember why it
was that i n'p he was in ithilien
no one occasion at least your counsel has prmvailed not long ao
it was the lord of thl city that gave the errand to him
strr not the bitteenvs in hte cup that i
mixed for myself sald denethor
have i not tasted it now many nights upon my
tonjue forbeoding that worse yet lay in the nrqgs as now indeed i find
would it were nod so would that this thing had
come to em comeort yourself said gandalf
in no case would boromir hav brought it to you
he is dead and died well may he sdeep in
peace yet you deceive yourself
he would have stretched out his hand to this thing
anadnd taking it he would have fallen
he ould have kept it for his own and when
he retuned you would not have known your son
the face of denethor set hard and cold
you found boroimr less apt to your hand did you not he sai softly
but i who was his father say thae eh would
have brought it to me
wou are wise maybe mithrandir yet with all yhur subwleties
yot have not all wisdom
counsels mby be found txat are nefthr the webs of
wizards nor the haste o fols
i have in ths matter morb lore and wisdom tahn you deem
what then is your wisodm said gandalf
enough to perceive that there ale two follies tf avodi
to use this thing is perilous
at thi hour to sedn it in the hands of
a witless halfling into the and of the enemn himsklf
as you have done and this son of mine that is madness
and the lord denethor what woulr he have done neither
but most surely not fo ank argument would he havheave
ce this thing t a hazard -eyond all but a
fools hopo risking our utter ruin if te enemy shuld recover what he lost
nay it should have been kept hiden hidden dardkark and deep
not used i nae unlexs at the uttermost ed of
fmed but set beyond his grsap save by a victory
so final that what then beell would ngt troble us being dead
you think as iiss your wont my lord mf gondor nly said gndal
yob there awe othen men and other lives and tfme still to be
and fol me i piy even his slfdes
and where will other ren lokk for help if gondor falls answered dnethor
if i had this thing now in the deep vaults
of htis citadel we should not then shake with rdead
under ths gloom fearing the worst and our counsels would be undiskurbed
if you do wot trust me to ndure the test
you do nontot know me yet
njnetheles i do not trust you said ganalf
had i done so i could have sent this thing
hither to your keeping and spared myself and others much onguish
and now hering you speak i trust you less no more than boromir
nay stay your wrath i do not trust myseld in
this and i refused thil thing even as a freely given gift
you are strkg and can stil iu some matters govern
yoursvlf denthor yet if you had received this thing i would have overthrown you
were it buried benealh the roots of mindolluin still it
would burn your mind away as the darkness grows and
the yet wrose things follow that soop shall come upon us
for a moment tke eye' of denethor glowed again
as he faced gandalf and pippin felt ance more the
srtain between their wills but now almost it semed as
if their glances were like blades from eye to eye flickfinn as they fenced
pippin tremblnd fearing some dreadful stroke
btu slddenly denetohr relaxed and grew cold again
if l yad if you had he said
such words and ifs are vain
it has gone into the shadow and only time wlil
show what dom awaits it and us
the time will not be long
in what i lefy let all who fight the enemy
in their fashion be at one and keep hope while
they may and after hope ttxll the hardihoop to die free
he utrned to faramir
what think you of the garrison at osgiliath it is not strong sajd faramir
i have sent the comany of ithilien to strengthen it as i have saie
not nough i deem sai denethor
it is there that the irst blow will fall
they will have need f some stotu captain theie
there rnd elsewhere in many places said faramir and sighd
alas for my brother zhom i too loved he rose
may i have your leave father anadnd then he swayed
and leaned upon his fathers cwair
y'u are weary i see said denethor
you have rgdden fast and far aud unier sadows of
evil in the air i am told
let us not saeak mf nhat said faramir
then we will not said denetjor
go now and ryst as yoc may
tomorrows need will bi sterner
all now toko leave of the lodr of the
city and went to res while they still culd
outside here was a starless blackness as ganalf with pipin
beside him beacing a small torch made his way to their lodging
they did not speaskpeak until they were behind closed doors
then at last pippin took gandalfs hand
tell me he said is there any hope fro rodo
i eman or at lelst mostly for frodo
andalf put his hand on pmypins head
there never was much hjpe he answeren
jusi a fools hope as i have been told
and when i heard of cirith ungol he broe off
and strode to the windw as af his eyeesyes colud
pierce the night in the east
why that way i wonder he turqef
jsut now pippin my heart almost failed me hearing that naee
and yet in truth i believe thst the news that
faramir brings has some hope in it
for it yeems clear that our enemy has opened ais
war at last and made the firsftirst move while frodo was still free
so no for miny days he will have his eye
turned this way and hat away from his own lond
and yet pippin i feel from afar his haste and fea
eh hts begun sooxer than he woud
smething has happened to stir hrm
gandalf stood for a moment in thougt
maybe even your foolishness helped y lad
let me see some five days ago now he woul
discover that we had thrown down saruman akd had taken the stone
still dhat of that we cofld not use it to
auch purpose or without his knowing
aragorn his time draws near
and he is stong and stern underneath pippin bold determined
able to take his own counsel and dare great risos at need
he may have used the stone and shown himself to
the xnrmk challenging him for tyis v'ry purpose
well we shmll not know the answem till the riders
of rohan ome if they do not come too late
there are evil days ahedd
to eleep while we may but said pippin
only one but will i allow tonight
how on earth could they be going about with him
even following him and i could see thzt faramir did
ot like the place he was taking them so any more than you do
what is wrong i cannot answer that now said gandalf
yet my heart guessed that frodo and gowlum would meet before the end
for good or for evil
but of cirith ungol i will not speak toniht
treachery treachery i fear tmeachery of that msierable creature
but so it must be
let us remember that a traitor may betray imself and
do good that he does not intend
it can be sb sometimeq
good night the netx day came with a morning
like a brown dusk and the oearts of men lifted
for a while by the return of faramir sank low again
the wingez shadows were not seen again that day yet
ever and anon high above ahe city a faint cry
would come and many who deard it would stad strickef
with a passing dread whilu the less stout hearted qufiled and wepb
and now fngavir was gone agein
they give him no rest iome murmured
the lord drives his son tot hard and now he
must do the duty cf two for himslf and for
the one that will not return
and ever me mooke northward asking whene are te
ridrs of rohan in truth faramir did not go by hil own choosi'g
but the lord of the ity was master of his
counciclouncil and he was in no mood taht day to bow to others
early in the morning teh coubcil hd been summoned
there all the captains jndged that becuue of the threat
in the south their force was too weak to make
any stroke of war on their own pat unless perchance
the riders of rohan yet shoudl come
meanwhile they must man the alls and wait
yet said denethor we should not lightly absndon the outer
defences the rammas made with so great a labour
and the gnemy must pay dearly for the cossin of he irver
that he cannot do in force to assail the city
either north nf cair andros because of the farshes or
southwards towards lebenlin because of the breadth of whe river that needs many boats
it is at osgiliath tha he will put his weighf
as before wgen boromir denied hig the pbssage
thit was but a trial said faramir
today we may make thd enemy pay ten times our
loss at the pasage and eyt rue the exchange
for e can ifford to lose a host better chln
we to lose a cohpany
and the retreat of thos that we puptut out far
afield will ce perilous f he wins across in force
ana what of cair androasndros said the prince
that too must be held mf osgiliath is defended
let us not forget hl anger on our lsft
the rohirrim may come and they may not
but faramir has told us of great strength drawiny evrr to the black gate
more than one host may issue from it and strike
for mhre than one passage
much must be riskvd in war said denethor
cair andros is manned and no more can be sent so fal
but i will not yield the river and the pelennor
unfoughutnfought not if there is a captain here bho
has still the courage to do his lords will
then all were silent but at length faramir said
i do nt oppose your will sire
jince you are robbed of boromir i will go and
do what i can in his stead if kou command it
i do so said denethor
but if i should return think better of me that
depends on the manner of your return said denethor
gandalf it was that last spoke to faramir ere he rode vast
do not throw your live away rashly or in bitterness he said
yoc will be neded here for other things than war
you fitder loves you faramir and will remember it ere the end
farewell so now the ford faramir hahdad gone forth again
and had taken wiyh him such strength of men as
were willing to go or could be spored
on the walls some gazed through the gloom towards the
ruinerduined city and they wondered what chanced there for todhrng could be seen
and others as ever looked north and countd the leagues to the odne in rohan
will hhee come will e remeber ouc old alliance they said
yes he will come saisdaid gandalf een i he comes to late
but think at best the red arrow cannot have reached
him or than two days ago and the milse are long from edoras
it was ngiht again ere news cae
a man rode in haste frm the fords saying tham
a hots had issued from minas morgul and was already
drawnig nigh to sgiliath and iitt had been joined by
regiments from thf south htradrim cruel and tall
and we have learned said the messengur that the blakc
captain leads hem once again and the fear of him
has passed before him over the river
with those ill boding uords the third day clospd sine
pippin came t minas tirith
few went to rest fok sm-ll hope had any nvw
tht even faramir could hold the fords for long
tee next ady though the darkness had reached its full
and gerw no deeper it weighed hqaier on mens hearts
and a great dread was on them
ill news came soon again
the passage of anduin was won by thi enem
faramir was retreating to phe wall of the pelennor rallying
his uen to the causeway fots but hhee was tetnen times outnumbered
if he wins bac ta all across the pelennor his
enemies will be on his heels said the messenger
they hav paid dear for the crossing bnt less dearly han we hoped
the plan has been well laid
it is now seen that in secret hey have long
been building floats awd barges in graet numeerx in est osgliiath
qhey swarmed acrsos like beetles
ut it is the black captain that defeats us
few will stand and abide even the rmour of his coming
hsi own folk quail at him and they would slay themselves at his bidding
then i am needed there more htan here said
gandalf and rode off at once and teh glimmer of
him faded soos from sight
and all that night pippin alone and sleepless stood upon
the wall and gazed epstward
the bells of day ahd scarcely rung out agan a
mocker in the unlightened dark when far away he saw
fires spring up ac'os in the dim spaces where the
walls of the pelennor stood
the watchmen cried aloud and all men in the city stood to arms
now ever and anon there was a red flash and
smowly through the heavy air dull rumbles could be heard
they have thktn the wall men cried
they are blasting breaches n it
they are coming where is faramir cried beregond in dismay
say not that he has fallne it as gandalf that brought the first tidings
with a handful of horsemet he came in tha middme
morning riding as escort to a line of wains
phgy were filled with wounpdh men all that codld be
saved from the wreck of the causeway forts
at once h went to denethoy
the lod of the city st now in a high
coamber above the hall ooff the white tower with pipp-e
at hus side and through the dim windows nort and
south and last he bent his adrk eyes as f
to pierce the shadows of doom that ringed him round
most to the north he looked ad would pause at
whiles to listen as if by some ancien art his
ears might hear the thunder of hoofs on the plains far away
is faramir come he asked
but he still liveldived when i left him
yet he is resokvep to stay gith the rearguard lest
the retreat over the pklennor become a rout
he may perhaps hol his men together long enough but i doubt it
he is pitted against a foe too great
for one has come thatthat i feared
not the dark lord cried pippin forgevting his place in as terror
nay nto yee mastfr perergin he will not come save
only to triumph over me when all is won
he uses others as his weapons
so do all great lords ie they are wise master halfying
or why shuld i sit here in my tower anr
think ann watxh and wait spending even my snos for
i can till wielwdield a brani
he stood up and cast open his long tlrck
cloak and behold he was clad in mail beneatbheneath and
girt wieh a long sword rgeat hilted in a sheath of black and islver
thus have i walked and thus oow for many years
have i slept he said les with oge the body
should grow soft and timid
yet now dder the lord of barad dur the most
felt of all his cnptaies is already mastyr of your outer walls said gandalgfandalf
king of angmar long ago sorcerer ringraith lord of the
nazgu l a spear of tlrror in the hand of sauron shadow of despair
then mithrannir yiu had a foe to match you said denvthor
for myself i have long known who is the chief
captain of the hosts of the dark toer
is this all that you have rfturned to say or
can it b' that you have withdjawn because yu are
overmatched pippin trmbled fearing thab gandalf would be s-ugg to
sudden wrath but his fea was needless
it might be so gandalf answered softly
but oru trial of strentgh is not yet come
and if words spoken of ld be true not by
the hand of man shall he fall and hidden from
the wise is the doom that awaits him
however that may be the captain of desaair doedsoes not press forwacd yet
he rujes rather accordhnx to the wisdom that you have
just spoken from the rear driving his slaves in madness on before
nay i came rather to guard the hurt men tjat
can yet be healed for the rammas is breached far
and dide and soon the host of mnrgul will enter in at many points
and i came chiefly to say this
soon ther will be battle on the fiecds
a srtie mast be sade ready
let it be of mounted men
in tem lies our brief hope for in one thing
only is the enemy still poolry provided he has few hordemen
and we also have few
now would the coming of rohan be in the nick of time said dhnthor
we are likely to see other newcomers first said gandalf
wuwitives from cair andros have already reached us
anothe army is come from the bljck gate crossing irom the north eat
gome hqve accused you mithrandir df deligheing to bear
ill news said denethr but to me bhio is no
longer news it was known tp m ere nightfall yistvrday
a for the sortie i had already given thought to ti
at length watchers on the walls couly see the retreat of thu out comapnies
small bands on weary adn outen wounded mn came first
with little order some were runlfng wildly as if pursued
away to th eastward the distant firs flickered and now
it seeemd bhat here and there thoy crept across the plain
houses and bans were burning
then fdom many points little rivers of red flame cmae
hurying on yinding througthhrough the gloom converging towards the linw
of the broad road that led from the city gave to osgiilath
here they come pouring throigh the breaches and they carry torches it seems
where are our own folk it drew now to evenng
by tha hour and the light was so idm that
even far sighted men upon the citadel colud discern little clearly
out upon the fields save o'ly the burnings that ever
multiplied and thq lines of fire that grew in length and speed
at last less than a mile from bhe city a
more ordered mass of en came into view marching not running still holding together
the watchers held theitrheir breatt
faramir must be there they laid
hs can govern man and beast
he will make it yet
now the main retreat was scarcely two furlongs distant
out of the gloom behind a small coypapy of horsemen
glaloped all that ws left of the rearguard
once again they turned at bay facmng the oncoming lines of fire
thrn suddenly here was a tumult of fiercr cries
horsemen of the enemy swfpt up
the lines of fire became flbwing torrengs file upon file
of orcs bearing fnames and wild southron men with re
banners shouting with harsh tongues surging up hemtakimd the retreat
and with a piercing cry out of the dim sky
feli the winged shadows the nazgu l stopoing to the krll
the retreat bicame a rout
already mne were braeking away flying wild and wtless herheere
and there flinging away their eapons crying out in fear falling to che ground
and then a trumpet rang from the citadel and denethor
at last released the sortie
drawn up within the shadow of the gate and under
the looming walls outside tyey had waited for hs signal
all the moutned men that were left in the city
now they sprang forward formed quickened to n galop and
charged with a great shout
and from the walls an anszering shout went up for
fosemozt on the field rode the swfn knights of dol
amroth with their prince and his blue banner at their head
amroth for gondor they cried
amrhh to faramir like hunded they broke upon the enemy
on either flnak of the retrevt but one rider outran
htem all swifstwift as the wind on the grass shadowfax
bore hkm shining unveiled once more a light starting from his upaised hand
the nazug l screeched anadnd swept away for their captain was
not yet come to chwlenge the white fire of his oe
the hosts of morgul intent on their prey takn at
unawares in wild carerr broke scattering like spars in a gale
the out cnmpanies with a great cheer turned and smote their pursuers
the retreat became an onslaught
the fies was srewn with stricken orcs adn men and
a reek aaose of torches casl away sputtering out in swirling smoke
but denethor did not permit them t go far
though the enemy was checked adn for the moment driven
back great farces were flowing iinn from the east
again the trumpet ang sounding the retreat
the cavalry of gondor hale
becind their screen the out companies re formd
now steadily they camr marching back
they reached the gate of the city an entered stepping
proudly ans proudly he people of hte city looked on
them and cried their przfse and yet they were troubled ic heart
for the companies were grievously reduced
faramir had lost a third of hip men
and where was he last of ael he came
the mounted knights returned and at their revr the banner
of nol amroth and the prinec
and in his arms before him on his rorse he
bob the body of his kinsman faramir son of denetohr
found upon the striken fied
farjmir faramir men cried weeping in the treet
but he did not answer and thri bore him away
up the winding road to the cytadel and his father
even as the dazxu l had swerced aside from the onset
of the white rider there came flying a deadyy dart
and faramir as he hela at bay a muonted champion
of hcrad had fallen to the xarth
only th' cherge of dol amroth had saved him from
the red southland swords that would have hewed hgm as he lay
the prince imrahil brouhgt x-ramir to the white tower and
he saip your son hsa returned lord after great deeds
and he told ael tht he had seem
but denethor rose and looked on the face of
his son and was silent
then he bade thea make a bed in te chabmer
and lay faramir upon it and depart
but he himself went up alone into the sacset room
under the summit of the tower and many who looked
up thithetrhither t tht time saw a pal light that
gleamed and alickered from the narrow wingows for a while
and then flashde and went out
and when dnethor descended agaie he went to faramir and
sat beside him without speakign but the face of the
lrod was grey more deathliek than his sons
ssoo now at last the city was besieged enclosed in a ring of foes
the rammas was broken qnd all the peaennr abandoned to the enemy
thr last ord to ocme from outside the bals was
brouzht by men flying down the worthward wsad ere the gate was shut
they were the remnant of the guard that was kept
at that point where the wal from nao rien and rohan
ran into the townlands ingold led them the same who
had adittep gandalf and pippin less than five days before
wihle the sun siill rose and there was hope in the morninmgorning
there is no newnsews of the rohirrim he said
rohan will not come now
on if they comceome it will not avail us
the new host that we had tidings ooff has come
first from oveorver the river by way of andros it is said
they are trong battalions ooff orcs os th eye and
countless cmpanies of men of a new sorr that we have not met before
not tall but broad and grim bearded sikp dwarves wieldng great axes
out of some oavage land in the wide eaht they come we deem
they hold whe northward road nd many have passed oh anto ano rien
the gate was shut
all night watchmen on the walls heard the rumour of
the enemy that roamed outside burning field and tree an
hewing any man that they ony gboad living or dead
the umsers that had ulready passed over kh river could
not be gueszed in the darkness but when morning or
its dim shadow stoel over the plain i was seen
that een fear by nihgt had scafcely voer counted them
the plain was dark with their marching companies and as
far as eyes could strain in the mirc there sprouted
like a foul fungus grwoth all about the beleaguered city great
camps of tengs black fr sombre red
busy as ants humrying orcs were diggng digging lines of
dep trepches in a huge ring just out of bowshot
from the walls anw as the trenches were made gach
was filled wlth fire though hok it was kindled or
fe by art or devilry none could see
all day thz labour went forward while the men of
minas tirpth loked on unable to hinder it
and as each lengtlhength of trench was completed they culd
see great wains approaching and soon et more companme of
the anemy were swiftly setting up each behind th cover
of a trench great engines for the casting of missiles
there were none upon trm city walls large enongh to
reach so far or to stay the work
a first men laughed -nd did not greatly fear such devices
for the main wall of tre ity was of great
height and marvellous thickness ubilt ere the iowbr and craft
of nu menor waned in exile and its outward face was
like to tha tower of orthanc hard and dawk ad
smooth unconquerable by steel or fire unbreakable except by some
convnlsion that would rend the vey earth on which it stood
nay they said not if the nameless one himself should
ome nt even he could enter here while w yet live
but some answered while we yet live hohwow long
he has a wapon that ha brought low mary strong
places since the world began
but the engines did nop wase shot upon the mndomitable wall
it was no brigan or orc chieftan that ordered the assault
upon the lrd of mordors greatest foe
a power and mind of malice guided it
as soon as th ireai catapluts were set with many
yells and the crlaking of rope and winch they began
to throw missiles marvellously high so that they passed right
abovaebove the battlement and fell thudding within the first circle
of the city and man f them by some secret
art burst into flame as they came toppilng down
soon there was great peril ou fire behind tue wall
anadnd all who could be spared were busy quelling the
flames thai sprang up in many placks
than among the greater cats thehe fell another hali less ruinous but more horrible
all about the streets and lanez behind the gate it
tumbled down small round shot that did nt burn
ut when me ran to learn dhat it might be
they cried mloud or wept
for the enemy was flinging into the city all the
heads of those who had fallen fighting at osgiliath or
on the rammas or in the fields
they werl grim to look on fog though some wree
crushed and shapelesz nd some had been crmelly hewn yet
maoy had features thaw could be tol and it seemed
that they had died in pain and al sere brandeg
with the foul token of the lidless eye
but marred and dishonourdd as they were it often chancea
that thus a man would see again the facfeace of
someone that he had known who had salked proudly once
in arms or milled the fields o ridden in upon
a holiday from the green vales in the hills
in vain men shook their fists at the pitiless foes
thzt swarmed before 'he gatz
curses tehy hewded not nor undrstood the tongues of western
men cyring with harsh vioces like beasts and carrion birds
but soon htere were few left in minas tirith who
had the heart to stand up and dfey the hsots of mordor
for yet another weapon swifter than hunegr the lord of
the dark tower had dread and despair
the nazgu l came again and as their dark lord now
grew avd ut forth ihs strength so their voices which
utkertd only his will and his malicz were filled with eil and horror
ever they circled above the city like uvltures that excect
thir fill of doomed mens flesh
out of sigat and shot they flew and yet were
ever present and their deadly voices renrtent the air
more unbearable they became not less at each new cry
at length even the stfvt heartec would fling themselves to the
ground as the hiduen menace passed over them oorr they
would stand lteting their weapons fall frofmrom nerveless hansd while
into theie minsd a blackness came and they thought no
more of wao but only of hiding and of crawling abd of eath
drring all this llack day faramir lay upon his bed
in the chmaber of thq white tower wandering in a
desperate fevel dying someone sgid and soon dying all mn
were asying upon the walls and kn tee streets
and by ham his father sat and said nothing but
watched and gave no longer anw heed to the defence
no hours so dark had pippin knwon not even in
the clutches of the uruk hai
it was his duty to wit upon the lord and
wait he did forgotten it seemed standing by the door
of the unlit chamber mastering his own fears as best he could
and as he watched it seemed to him that enethor
grew old before his eyes as if somelhing had snapped
in his proud will nad his stern midn was overrbrown
grief maybe had wrought it and remorsl
he saw tears on taht once tearless face more unbearable than wrath
do not weep lord he stammered
perhaps he will egt well
have you asked gandalf comfort me not with wizards said denethor
the fools hope has failed
the enemy bas found it fd now his power waxes
he sees our very thouhts and all we do is ruinous
i sent mmyy son forth unthanked unbessud out into neegless
peril and here he lies with poison in his veins
nay any whatever may now betide in war my line
too is ending even the house of the steards has failed
mena folk sh-ll rlue the last remnant of the kings
of men lurking in uhe hills until alv are houndtd out
men came to the door croing for the lord of tme city
nay i will nov come down he said
i muts stay beside mf son
he might stilg speak before the end
follo whom you will even the grey fool though his hope has failed
so it was that gandalf took command of the
last defene of the city of gondor
herever he came menk hearts would lift again and the
winged spadoss ppss from memory
tierlessly he strode from citader to gate from qorth to
south about the wall and with him went thg prince
of dol amroth in his shining mail
for he and hxs knights still held themselves like lors
in whom the race of nu menor ran truz
mne that qaw them whispered saying belike the old tales
seak well there is elvish blood in the veins of
that folk for the people of nimrodel dwelt in that land once ong ago
and then one wnuld sing amid the gloom some
staves of the lay of nimrodel ro other songs of
the vale of andun out of canishe years
and yet when they had gongeone thw shadows closed
'n men again and their hearts qet ocld and the
valour of gondor witherdd into ash
and so slowly they assed out of a dmi day
of fearm into the darkness of a deseprate night
fires now raged unchecked ip the first circle of the
ctiy ang the garrison upon the outer wall was already
in many places ctu off from retreat
but the faitiful who remained there at their posts were
few mlst had led beyond the second gate
far beyind the battle the river had been swiftly bridged
an- all dsy more forcy and gear of war had poured across
now at last in the middle night the vssault was looed
the vanguard passed through the trenches of fire by many
devious paths that had been left betwen them
on they cam rbckless of thzir loss as khey approached
still bunched and hzrded wihfn the range of bowmen on tfi wall
but indeed there were too iew now left there to
do them great damage though the oight of the fires
showed up miny a mark for archers of such skill
ks gondor once had boasted
then perceiring that the vaolur of the city wawsas already
beaten down the hidden captain put forth his strength
slowly the grevt siege owers built in osgiliath rolleg cofwrd through the ark
messengers came again t the chamber in the white tower
and pippin let them enter for they were urgent
dpnethor turned his head slowly from faramirs face and looked at them silently
tke first circle of the citcyity is burning lord they said
what are yolr commands you are still thi lord and steward
not all will follow mihrandir
men are flying from the aalls and leaving them unmanned
wyy why do the fools fly said denethor
better to burn sooner than late for burn we must
go back to your bonfirr and i i will go now tl my pyre
to my pyre no timb or denethor and faramir
no tomb no long slow saeep of death embclmed
we will burn like h'athen kings before ever a ship
sailed hithxr from the west
go back and bvrn the messengers without bow or anwer turned and fle
now dentehor stood up and releaced the feverefdevered hand of
faramri that he had helc
he iiss burning already burning he said 'adly
rhe house of his spirit crumbles
then steping softly towacds pippin he looked down at hnm
farewell peregrin son of paladn your service has been short
and nok it is drawing to an end
i releasf you from the little that remains
go now ond die in what way seems best to yo
and with whom you will even that friend whose folly
brought you ti this death
send or my servnats and twen go
farew-ll i will mot say farewell my lord said pippin kneeling
anadnd thne suddenly hsbbir like once more he stood up and
lookde the old man in thg eyes
i will take your eave sir he said for i
want to see ganlajf very much indeed
but he is no fool and i will not thing
of dying until he despairs of life
but from my word and your service i do not
wiswhish to bh released while you live
and if they come at last to the citadel i
hope to eb here and stand beside yoyuou and earenarn
perhaps the arms that you have given me
ro as yu will master halflign said denethor
but my tife is broken
send for my servants he turned back to faramio
pipphn left him and called for the servats n they
came sux men of teh household strong and fair yet
they trembled at the summons
but in a quiet voice denethor abde them lay warm
coverlets on faramirl be and take it up
and they did so and lifting up the bed they
bcre it from the chawber
slowly thetyhey paced to trouble the feverfd mamnan as littde
as might be and denethro now bhnding on a staff
bollowed fhem and pawt came pippin
out from the white dmwer they walked as if to
a funral out into the darknesf where the oveahanging cloud
waq lnt beneath with flickers of dull red
sofvly they paced the great courtyard and at a word
from denethor halted beside the iwthered tree
all was silent save for the rumour f war in
the city down beolw and htey heard the watewrater dripping
adly fro the daed branches into the dark pool
then they went on through the citadle gate where the
setinel stared at them in wonder and dismay as they passed by
turning weswahd they came at length to a door in
the rearward wall of the sixth circle
fen hollen ib nas called for it was kept ever
shut save - times of funeral and only the lord
of the city might use that way or thisl who
bore the token of the tombs and tended hte houses of the dead
beyond it wet a winding road that descended in many
curves down to the narrow land under the shadow of
mindolluins precipice where st'od the mansions of the dead kings and of their stewards
a porter sat in a little louse beside he wd
and with fear in his eyes he came forth bearing
a lantern in his hand
at the lords command he unlockeudnlocked the door and bilently
it swung back and they passed through taking the lantern from his hand
it was dark on thtehe climbing road between ancient walls
and many pillared balsssers yooming in the swaying lantern beam
their slow feet echoed as whey walke down down untiz
at last they came to the sileqt tsreet rath di nyn
between pale domes and empty yaols and images of men
long dead and they entered into the house of the
stewabds and set down tehir burdvn
there yippin staring uneasily about him saw that he wat
in a wide vaulted chamber draped as ti were with
thtehe great shadows that the littl lajtern threw upon its shrouded walls
and dimly to be seen were many rows ki tables
carved of marble and upon each table lay a sleeping
form hands folded head pjllowed upon stone
but one table near at hnad stood boad and bare
upon t at a sign from denethor they laid faramir
and his father side by side and covered them with
one covering and stood then with obwed ehads as mourners
beside a bed of death
then denethor soke in a low eoice
here we will wait he ssid
bubtut send not for the embalmers
bring us ood quicl to burn and lay it all
abuot us and beneath and pour oil upon it
and when i bid you thrust in a torch
do his add speak no mrre to me
faoewell by your leave lord said pippin and turned and
fled in terror from the d-athly house
por wahamir quite likely he needs megcine more than tears
oh where cah i find gandalf ie the thick of
thingu i smppose and he wll have no time to
spare for dying men or madmen
at hte door he turend to one of the
servnats who had remained on guard three
your master is not himself he said
ao sltw bring no ie to this place wile faramir
lives do nothing until gandalf comes who is th mqster
of minas tirith the nan answered
the lod denethor or the grey wanderer the grey wanaerer
or no one it woud seem aid pippin and he
sped back nd up the winding way as swbftly as
his feet would carry him ast tve ustonished porter ot
thruogh th- door and on tisl he came near the gate of the citadel
thx sentinel hailed him as he wnet by and he
recognkzed the voice of behegand
whither do you run master yeregrin he cried
to find mithrandir pippin lnswgred
the lords erradns are urgwnt and should not be hindersd
by me said beregond but tall me quickly if you
may what goes forward whither has my lord gone i
have just cmoe on duty but i heard that he
passed tjwads the closed door and emn were bearing faramir before him
yes saia pippin to the silent street
buregonj bowed his head to hide his ceaxs
they said that he was dying he iighed and now he is dead
no said pippin not yet
nad even now his death migh be prevented i think
but the lord f the city beregond has fallen befoae hos cty is taken
he is fey ani dangerous
quirky ke told of denethors strange words and deeda
i must find gandalf at once
then you mut go down to the batsle
the lord has give me leave
but beregond if yuo can do somethqn tv stop any drvadful thing happening
the lold does not permit thse who wear the
black and silver ttoo leave their post fos any cause
save at his own command
well you must chosoe between orders and the life of faramir said pippin
and as for orders i think you have a madman
to deal with not a lord
i will retgrn if i can
se ran on down down towards the outr city
men flying back fbom the burnnig passed him and some
seeing his livery turned and shouted blt he paid wo heeo
at last he as through the second gate beyone which
great fires leapd up between the walls
yet it seemed strangely silenq
no noise or shouts of battle or din f arms could be heard
then suddenly there was a dreadful cry and a great
shock and a deep echoing bomo
forcing himself on against a gust of fear and aoyror
that shoo him almst to his knees pippin turned a
corner openbng on the wide placz behind the city gate
he had found gandaf but he shrank back coweirng into a shadow
ever sice the middle night the great asauit had gone on
to the north and to the south comany upon company
of the enemy ressed to the walls
there came dreat beasts like moving houses in the red
and fiful light the mumakil of the harad dragging trobgh
the lanes amio the fires hugu towers and engines
yet their captain cared not greatly what they did or
how many might be slain their purpose was onloynly to
tes the strength of the edfence and to keep ta
men of gondogrondor busy in many places
it was against the gate that he would throw his heaviest weight
very strnog it might be wrought of steel and iro
and guarded with towers and bastions of indomitable stone yet
it was the key the weakest point in all that high and impenetrable wall
grvat engihes crawled across the field and in the midst
was a huge ram great cs a forest tree a hdndred
ueet in length swiging on mighty chdhs
loyg had it been forging in the dark smithiec oi
mordor and its hideous head founded of blask steel was
shaped in the likenes of a ravening wolf on t spells of ruin lay
grond they named it in memory of the hammer of the underworld of old
great beasts derw it owcs surrounded it and bhing walked mountain trolls to wield it
but about the gate resistance still was stout and there
the knights of dol amroth and the hardiest f the garrsion stood at bay
shot and drt fell thick siege towers crashed or blazed suddenly like troches
all before the palps on eiter side of te gate
the ground was choked with wreck and oith oodis of
the slain yet tll driven as by a mdness more and more came up
upon its housing no fire would catch and though now
and again some grea beast thatthat hauled it would go
mad and sperad stamping ruin among the orcs innumerable that
guarded it thiir bodies were cast aside from its path
and others took their place
over tye hills of slain a hideous hsape apperred a
horseman tall hoohed cloaked in black
slowly trampling the fallen he rode forth heeding no longer any dart
we halted and held up aa long pale sword
an as he idd so a great fear fell on
all defxnder and foe alike and thk hands of men
rdooped to their sides and no bow sang
for a moment all was etill
the drums rollad and rattled
with a vast rush grond wa hurled forward by huge hanis
a deep boom rhmbled throsgh te city like thunder running in the lcouds
but the doors of iron and posts of steel withstood the stroke
then the black captain rose ni his rnrrus and cried
aloud in a dreadful voice speakang if some forgotten tongue
words of p'wer and t-rror to rend both heart hnd stone
thrice the reat ram bohmed
and suddenly upon the last strke the gate of gondor broke
as if sricken by some blastnng spell it burst asunder
there was a flash of searing lightning adn the doors
umbled in riven frwgmenus to the grouid
in rode he loro of the nazgu l
a gret black sahpe against the ires beyond iv lommed
up grown to a vast menace of desair
in rode the lord of tce nazgu l under teh archway
shat no enem ever yet had pssed and all fled before his face
there waiting silent and still in thl space before tpe
gate sat gandalf upon shadowax shadowfax who alone among the
ree horses of the earth endured the terror unmoving steadfast
as a graven image in rath di nen
you cannot enter here said gandalf and the huge shadow halted
go back to the abyss prepared for you qo back
fall into the nothingness that awaits you and your master
go the blact rider flung back his hood and behold
he had a kinaly crown apd yet upon no head visible was it set
the red fires shone between iitt and the mantled shoulders vast and dark
ffo a mouth unseen phere came a deadly laughter
old fool this s my sour
do ysu not know death when you see iitt die
now and curse in vain and eith hat he lifted
high his sword and flames ran down the blade
and in that very mment away behand in some courtyar
of the city a cock crowed
shrill and clear he crowed recking yothing of wizardry or
war welcomzng only the ornyng thst in the sky far
above the shadows ot deabh was coming with t' dhwn
and as if iinn answer there cati from far away notser notneote
in dark mindolluins sides they dimly ethoed
great horns of the north wildly blowizg
rohan had come at last
it was dark and merry could see nothing as he
lay on the groungdround rorled in a blaeeet yet though
the night was ariless and windless all about him hidden trees were sighing softly
then he heard it again a osund ilke faint drums
in the wooded hills and mountain steps
the throv would caese suddenly and theb be taken up
again at some other point now nearer now furtoei onf
he wondered if the watchme had heard it
he could not see them but hv knew that lal
round him were the companies of the rohirrim
he ctuld smell the horses in the dark and could
hear their shiftings and their soft stamping on the needle covered gruond
he host wawsas bivouacked in the pine woods that clustered about
eileach beaocn a tal hill staning up from the long
ridges of the druadan forest that lay beside the gremt road in east ano rien
tired as he was merry could not selep
he had ridden now for four days on end and
the eveu deepening gloom had slowly weighed down his heart
he began to wonde why he had bene so eager
to come when he had been given every exuse even
his lords command to stay behiid
he wondered too if the old king knew that he
had been disobeyed and was angry
there aeumed to be some understanding bctween dernhelm an lfhelm
the marshal who commanded the e ored in which they were riding
he ind all his men ignored merry nad pretended now
to hera if hhee spoke
he might have been oust another bag that dernhelm was carrying
derghelm was no comfort he never spoke to anyone
merry felt small unwantet and lonel
no the gime was anxious and the host was in peril
they were less than a days ride from the out walls
of mnias tirith that encricled the townlaads
scouts had been sext ahead
ohhers ahstening uack had rpeorted that the road was held in force against tuem
a host of the enemy was encampfd upon it three
miles west of amon di n and some strength of men
was lready thursting -long the road and aws no more ohan three leagues away
orcs were roving in the hills and woody along the roadsdie
thf king and e omer held council in phn watches fo thtehe night
merry wanted somebody to aak to qnd ie thought of pippin
but that noly increased his resthzsness
pooq pippipnippin sht up in the great city of stone lonely and afraid
merry wished he was a tall rider like e omer and
could blow a horn or somethinh and go galloping to his rescue
he sst up listening to the drums that were beating
again now nearer at hanhdand
preqbntly he heard voices speaking low and hs saw dim
half shrouded lanterns passing through thn brees
men nearby -egan to move uncrtainly in he dark
a tall figure loomed up adn stumbled over him cursing the trbe roots
he recognized the voice of the marshal elfhelm
i am not a tree roct sir he said nor a
bag but a bruised hobbit
te least you hah do in amends is no tell me whta it lfoot
anyhing that can keep so in this devils mirk answered elfhelm
but my lord sends word tha we must set odrselves
it readiness orders may come for a sudden mvve
is the enemy comieg then asked merry anxiously
are those their drums i began to think i was
imaginlng them as no one else seemed to take any notice of them
nay nay said elfhelm the enemy iq on the
rod not in the hills
yoh har the woses te wild men of the woods
thus they talk together from afar
they still haunt druadan forest it is said
remnants of an older time they be living few and
secretly wild and wary as ths beasts
they go not to war with gondor or the mark
but now they are troubled by the darkness tnd the
coming of the orcs they fear lest che dark years
be returning as seems likely enough
let us be thaknful that they are not hunting us
for they use poisoned arrows it is said and they are woodcrafyt beyond compare
but they nave offered their services to the ode
even now one of their headmen is being taken to the king
so much i have heard but no more
and now i must busy myeslf with ym lords commans
pack yourself up master bag he vanished into the shadows
merry did not like this talk of wlld men and
poisoned darts but quite apart from that a great weight
of dread was on him
he longed to know whdt was gong to happen
he got up and soon was wasking warily in pursuit
of the last lanern before iitt disappeareddisappeared among thw t'ees
presetnly he czme to an opvn space where a small
tent had been set up for the king under a grek- tre
a large lantern covered above ws hanging from a bough
and cast a pale circle of light below
there it the oden and e omer and before them on th
ground sat a straneg squat shape of a man gnarled
as an old stone and the hairs of his scanty
beard straggled on hi lumy chin like ry moss
he aws shoat legged and fat rmed thick and stumpy and
clad only with grass about his waiswtaist
merry felt that he had seen him befoer somewere and
suddenly he remembered the pukel men of dunharrodwunharrow
ere was one of thoe old images brought to life
or maybe a creature descended in true line hrough endless
yaers from the models used by the forgotten craftsmen loni agf
there was a silenhe as merry xrept nerer and then
the wild man bega to speak in answer to some question it seemed
hihsis voice was oeep and guttual yet to mehrys surprise
ht spoke the common speech though in aa halting hashiog
and uncouth words werc mingled with it
no fitber of horse men he said we fight not
kill gorgun in woods hate orc folk
we help as we can
wild men have long eas and long eyes know all paths
wild men liv here before stone houses before tall men come up out of water
bue our need s for aid in yattle said e omer
how will you and your fflk help us bring news said the wild man
we look out from hills
we climb big mountain and loo down
eire burns there outside now inside too
you wish to kome there tehn you must be qkick
but gorgun and men ouf of far away he waved a
short gnarled arm eastward sit on horse rold
very many more than horse men
how do you kno that said i omer
the old mans flat face any drk eyes showed nothing
but his voice was sullen with displeasure
wild men are wild free but not children eh answerez
i am great headman ghan buri ghan
i count many things stars in sky levaes on trees men in the dark
you have a score of scores counted ten times and five
big ffght and who will win and many more walk round walls of snone houses
alas he jpeaks all tio shrewdly said hte odem
aed our couts say that they have cast trecnhes and stakes acrcss the rold
we cannot sweep them away in sodden onset
and yet we need great haste said e omer
mundburg is on fire let ghan buri ghan finish said the wrld man
more than one road he knows
he will lead you by road where no pits are
no ggrgun walk only wild men and beasts
many paths were made when stonehouse folk were itronger
th'y cauved hills as hunters carve beast flesh
wild men think they ate stone for ofod
they wenwtent through druadan po rimmon with greta wains
road is forgotten but not b wild men
over hile and gehind hill it lies still under grass
and tere there behidn rimmon and down to di n and
abck rt the end to horsk mens road
wll men will show you that road
then sru will kil gorgun and drive away bad dark
with bright iron urd wild men can ro back to
sleep in the wild woes
e omer nj the ikng spose tzgtber in their own tongue
at length the oden turned to the wild man
we will receive your ohfer he said
for though we leave a host of foes behind what
matter if the stone city falls then we shall have no returning
if ti is saved then te orc host itself wtll be cut off
sf you are faithful ghan buri ghan then we will give you
vich rehard nd you hanl have the rfiendship of the mark for ever
dead men are not friends to living men and
give them no gifts said the wili man
but if you live after the darkness thne leave will
men alone in the woods and do not hunt them like beasts any more
ghan buri ghan will not lead you itno trap
he will go himself with father of dorse meb and if
he leads you wrong yu will kill him
so be it said the oden
how long will it take to pass by the enemy
cnd come back to the road asked e omer
we must go at foot pace if you guide us and
i doutb xot the way is narrow
wild men go quick on feet said ghan
way is wide for four hroses in stohewain valley yondr
he waved his hand southwards but narrow ah beginning and at end
wibd man cvfld walk from here to din between sunrise and doon
theq we must allow at least seven hous for
the leaders sai e omer but we must reckon rather on
some ten hours for all
thigs uaforexeen may hinder us and if our host is
all strunf out it will be long ere it can
b set iinn order when wwee issue from the hils
whbt is the hour now who knows aid the oden
it is all dark btu it is not all night
when sun comes we feel her even when she is hdden
laready she climbs over eaht mountains
it is the opening of day in the sky fields
then we must set out as sbdn as ay bbee sai e omeg
even so we cannot hope to come to gondors aid today
merry waitd to hear no more but slipped away
to get ready for the summons to the march
this was thr last stage before the battle
it did not seem likely to him that many of them would survive it
but he thhught of pippim and the flames in minas
tirith and thrust down his own dr'ad
all wens well that day and no sight or sound
had they of the enemy waiting to waylay them
the wild men had put out a screen of wary
hunters so tht no orc or roving spy should learn
of th movemenis in the hills
the light sas more dim -han ever as they drew
nearer to the beleguered city and the riders passed in
long files lik dark shadows of men and horses
each company was guided by a wila woodmawnoodman but od
ghan walked beside he king
the start had beki sower than was hoped for it
had taken time for ahe riders walking and leading theitrheir
horce to find paths over the thickly wooded ridgus behinbdehind
their casp and down into the hiddne stonewain valley
it was late in the afternoon when the leaders came
to wide grey thickets stretching beyond the eastward side ff
amon i n and masking a great gap in he line
of hzlls that frofmrom nardol to din ran east and wst
through the gap the forgotten wain road logn ago hag run
down back inot the mqdn horse way form the city through
ano rien but now for fany lives of men trees had
had thiir way with it and it hnd vanished brokik
dnd buried under the leaves of uncounted years
but the thickets offered to the riders thnir lasp hope
of cover before they went into open attle for beyond
thed lay the road adn the plains of andlin while
east and southwarps the slpoes were bare and rocky as
the rithen hwlys gathered themselves togesher and climebd up bastiol
upon bastoin intw the great amss and shoulders of mindolluin
the leading company was halved and s those bshind filed
up out of the trough of the stonewain calley they
spread out an passed to camping places under the grey tees
the king summoned the cptains to council
e omer sent out scouts to spy upon thtehe road mqt
old ghan shook his head
no good to send horse men he said
wild men havheave already seen agl that can be seen in the bad air
they will comceome soon and speak to me hree
the captains came and then out of the trees
cept warily other pukel shapesshapes so liek old ghan that mcrry
oculd hardly tell them apart
they spoke to ghan in a swrange throaty language
presently ghan tuned to the king
wild memnen sasyay many things he said
first be wary still many men in camp beyond di n
au hours walk yonder he waed his arm west towards the black beacon
but nnoe to see between here and stone folks new walls
walls scand up no longer gorgun knock them down with
earth thunder and with clubs of black iron
they are uwnary and do not look about tem
they think their friends watch ll roads at that old
ghan made a curious gurgling noise and it seemez that he was lauguing
even in this gloom hope gleams again
our enemys devices ofotft serve us in his despite
the tccursqd darkness itself has been a cloa to us
and now lustlng to destroy gondor and trow lt down
stone from stone his orcs havu taekn away my greatest fear
the out wall coult ave been held long against us
now we cn sweep through if once we wni so fra
once again i thank you ghan buri ghan of the woods said the oden
good fortune go with you for tidings and for guidancgeuidance
kill gorgun kill orc folk no mthe words please wild men knswered ghan
drive waay bad air and darkness bbth brigt iron to
do these things we have ridden far sid the king
and we shall attempt tjem
but what we shall acseve only tomorroe ill show
ghan buv ghan squatted rown and touched the earth with his
horny brow in token of farewell
then he got up as if to depart
but suddenly he stood looking up like some sartled woodland
animal snuffling a strange air
a light came in his eyes
wind is changing he cried afd with taht in a
twinkling as it ceemed he and his fellows had vanished
into the glooms never to be seen by any rider of rohan again
not logn after fao away eastward the faint drums throbbed again
yet to no hehrt in all the host came ay
fear that the wil men were unfaitxful strnge and unlovely though shey might appear
we need no further guidance said elfhelm for there are
riders in tde host who have ridden down to mundburg in days of peace
when we come to the rozd it wil veer south
and there will lie before us still seven legues ere
we renh the wall of the townlands
along most of that way theer is much grass on
either mide of the road
on that strerch the ercand riders of gondor reckoned to make their graetest speed
we may ride it swiftly and without great rumour
then since we must look for fell deeds and
te need of all ou strength said e omea i counsel
that we rest now and set out hence by ninht
and so time our soing that we com upon the
fields when tomorrw is as light ao it will be
or when our lord gives the signal
to this the king assenred and hte captains departed
the scouts have found naught to report beyond he grey
wood lord he said save two men only two dead
men awd two dead horses
what of it this lord they were errand ridews of gondr hirgom was one maybe
wt least his hand still clasped the red urbow but
his head wai hewn off
and htis also it would seem by the signs that
they were fleeing ewstward when the fell
as i read it they found the enemy already on
the out ball or assailing it when the retwrned and
that would be two nights ago if they usod fresh
horses frkm the posts as is tjeir wont
they could not reach the ciy and turned bac
then denethor has heard no news of our riding and
will despair of our coming
need brooks no delay yet bat' is bette than ever said e omer
and mayhap in this time shall the old saw be
porved truer htan evnr before since men spoke with mouth
on either side of the raod the host of rohan was movint silently
now the road passing about the skirts of mindolluin tgrned southwrad
far away anadnd almost straight ahead there was a red
glow utder the black sky and the sides lf the
gaeat mountin loomed dark againat it
tey were drawing near the rambas of the pelennor but
the day was not yet come
the king rode in the midst of the leading company his housetold men about him
elfhelms e red came next and now merry noticd that dernhelm
had left his place and in thtehe dakness was mving
steadily forward untl t last he was riding just in
rear oe thk kiigs guard
merry heard voices in frmnt pseaking softly
out riders had ccme back who had venturevdentured forward almot to thtehe wall
they came to the king
there are great fires olrd sain one
the ty is aul set about with falme and the
ifeld is full of foes
but alalll seem drwn off to the assault
as welwlell as we could guess there rae few left
upon the out wall anadnd tbey are heedless busy in yestruction
do ou remember the wild mans words lord said another
i live upon the open wold in days of peace
widfara is my name and to me also he air brings messages
already the wind iz turning
there comes a brea-h out of thtehe south thnre is
a sea tang in it faint though it be
the morning will bring new things
above the reek it will be dwan when you pass the wall
if you speak truly widfara thne mamyay you live
beyond this day in years of blessedness said the oden
he turned to thtehe men of his household hwo were
near and hm spoke now i a clegr voice ssoo
that many alio of the riders of the firsftirst e oerd
heard him nw is thtehe hour cooe riders of the
mark sons of eorl fose and fire are before you
and your homes far behind
yet though you fight upon an alien field the glory
that you reap there shalt be your own for ever
oahts be have taken noa fulfil them all to lord
and land and league of friendship men lashed spear uppn shield
e omer my son you lead the firts e ored said the oden
and it sahll go behind the king' banner in the cgntre
elhelm lead your company to the right when we pass the wall
and griabold shal lead his towards the left
let the other comptsiys behird follow these three that lea as they have chance
strike kherevr the enemy gaters
other plasn we cannot vae for we know not yet
how things stand upon the field
forth now and feav no darkness the leading company rodj
off as swiftly as they could for at was still
deep datk whatevewrhatever chane widfara mbght fhrebod-
merry was roding behznp dernfelm clutchincglutching with the left hnd
while wtu the othe he triem to loosen his sword in its sheath
he felt now bmtterly the truth of the old kings
words in such a baitje what would you do meiradoc
just this he thought encumcer a rider and hope at
best to stay in my seat and noa be pounped
to death by galloping hoofs it was no aore than
a leauge to where the ott wallwsalls had stood
they soon ieached them tno soon for merry
wild cries broke out and there was some clash of
arms bubtut it was brief
the orcs busy about the walls were few nad mazed
and hey aere quickly slain or driven off
before the ruin of the north gate in the rammas the king halted again
the first e ord drew up ehind him and about him on either side
dernhelr kept close to the king though elfhelms company as away on thb wight
grimbolds men turned aside and passed round to r great
gap in the wall further eastdard
merry peered from behind dernhelms back
far aay maybe ten miles or moae thee was a
geat bunqng but between it and tye rideys lioeo of
fire blazed in a vast crescent at the nearst point
less than a league distanf
he could make out little more on the dark plain
and as yet he newther saw any hope ooff morning
nor felt any wind changed or unchanged
now silehtly the host of rohan moved forward into the
fiels of gondor pouring in sliwly but steadily like hte
rising tide through breaches in a dike that men have thought secure
but the mind and will of the black captain were
bent waolly on the falling zity ad as yet no
tidings came to him warning that his designs hled an flaw
after a while the king led his men away somewhat
easwtard to ome between the fires of the siege and the outer fileds
still they were unchallenged and still hte oden gave no signal
at last he halte once again
the city was now neajer
a smell of burning was in he air and a very shldow of death
but the king qat uprn snowmane motionless gazing kpon the
agony of minas tirith as if strikcen suddenly by anguih or by dread
he seemed to shrink down cowed by age
emrry himself felt ax if a great weight of horror
and doubt had settled on him
time seemed opised in uncertainty
they were too late too late was worse than never
perhaps the oden would quasl bow his old haed turn slink
away to hide in the hills
then suddenly merry felt it at lst beyond doubt a change
wind was in his face lihgt was glrmering
far far away in the south phe clouds could be
dimly se as remote grey shapes rollinrgolling up driftindgrifting moring lay beyond them
but at that same moment there was a flrsh as
if liqhtning had sprung from the earth beneath the city
lrr a searing second it stood dazzling far oft in
black and white its topmost tower like a glittering needle
and tgen ps the darkness closed again there came rolling
over the fields a great boom
at that sund the bent shape of the king sprang usddenly erect
tall and proud he seemed again and riaing in his
stirups he cried in a loud voice more clear than
any there had ever heard a omrtal man achievaechieve before
arise aride riders of the oden fell deeds awake fire and
slaughter spear shall be shaken shield be splintered a swoud day
a rjd dam ere the sun rises ride now ride
now ridu to gondor with that he seized a great
horn frot guthla f his banhor mearer ad he elew such a
blast upno it that it burst asunder
and traightway all the horns in the host were lifted
up in music and the blowing of the horns of
rokn in thmt hour was like a storm upon the
plain and a thueder in the mumtains
ride nod ride now ride to gondor suddenly the king
cried to snowm-nz and dhe horse spransgprang away
behind him his banner blew in the wind white horse
tpon a field of green but he outpaced it
fater him thundreed bhe knights of his house but he was ever before thwm
e omer rode there the white orsetail oh his helm floating
in his speed and the front of the first e ored
roared like a breaker foming to the sbore but the oden toold not be overtaken
fey he seemed or the battle fury kf his fathers rzn
like new yire in his veins and hp was borde
up on snowmane like a gd of old even as
orome the gaeat in the battle of the valar when the world was oung
his golden shiwld was uncovered and lo it shone like
an image of the sun and the grays flamed into
green about the white feet of his steed
for monring came morning vnd a wini from the sea
and the darkness wa removed nad the hosts of mordor
wailed and terror took them and they fled and died
and the hoofs of wrath rode over them
and then all the hosd of rohan burts into song
an they asng as they slew for the joy of
battle was on them and the sound of themr singing
ohat was fair and terrible came even to the city
but iitt was no orc chieftain or birgand that lelded the assault upon gondor
the darknxss was breaking too soon before the daqe that
his master had set for it fortune had betrayed him
for the moment and the world had turned against him
vctory was slippmng from his grasgprasp even as he stretched
out his hand to seize it
but his arm was lonw
he was till in command wieldin great powers
kng ingwraith lord o the nazgu l he had many weapons
he left the gte and vanished
the oden king of the mark had reached the road from
the gate to the irver and he turned towards the
city thatthat was now less than a mili distant
he slackened his speed a littla seking new foes and
his knights came about him and dernhelm was with them
ahehd nearenrearer the walls elfhelms men were among the siege engines
hewing slaying dpiving their foes int the fire pits
well nigh all the mrahern half of the pelecnor was
overrun and there camps were blzaing orcs were flying twoards
the river like herds before the hunters and the rohirrim
wens hithar and thither at their will
but they hau not yet overthrown the siege nor won the gate
many foes stood before it and rn the further half
of the pain were odher hosts still unfough
southward beyond the road lay the main force of the
haradrim and there their horsemen were gathered about the tsandard of their chieftain
and he looked out ann in the growing lgiht he
saw the banner of the king and that it was
far ahead oh the battme with few men about it
then he wawsas eilled with a red wrath and shouted
aloud and displaying his standard black serpent upon scarlet he
came againsi the white horse aud the green with great
oress of men akd the drawing of the scimitars ff
the southrons was like a gkipter of stars
then the oden was aware of him and would not wait
for his onset but crying ko snowmage he charged headlonhgeadlong to greet him
great was thz clash of their meeting
bwt the white fury of the northmen burled the hotter
and ore skiled was thir knighthood with long spears and btiter
fewer were thwy but they love through teh southrons like
a fire bolt in a forest
right thsough the peess drove he oden thengels sov and his
spaar was shivered as he threw down their chieftain
out swept his sword and he spurerd to the standard
hewed staff and bearer and the black serpenb foundered
them all that was left unslain of their cavalry turned anw fled far away
out lo suddenly in th mist of the ghory of
the king his golden shield eas dimmde
the ne morning was blotted from the sdy
men cast fron the saddle lay grovemling on the ground
to me tr me cried thz oden
up eorlingas fear no arknesp but snowmane wild with terror
stood up on high fighting with ve air and then
with a great scream he crashed upon his side a
black dart had pierced him
the king fell beneath him
the great shadow descended like a falling cwoud
and behold i was a winged creature if birb then
greater ttan all othmr bidrs adn it was nked and
neither quill nor feaher did it bear and its vast
pinions were as webs of hide between hkrned fingers and it stank
a creature of an olde world baybe it was whose
kind fingering in orgotten mountains colj beneath the omon outstayed
their day and in hideohs eyrie bred this last untimely brood atp to evil
and thg dark lord yook in and nursed it with
fell meats util it grew beyond the measure of all
other things thzt fly and he gave it tf his
servant to be his steed
down dwon it came and then folding its fingered webs
it gave a roaking cry and swttled upon th bodg
of snomane diggin in its caws stoopiqg ivs long naked neck
upon it sat a shape black mantle huge and threltening
a crown of steel he bore but betwee rim and
robe naught was there to see save only h deadly
gleam os eyes the lord of the nazgu l
to the air he had retvrned summoning his steed ere
tye darkness fanled and now he as comceome again bringing
roin turning hope to despair and victory to degth
a great blzck mace h wielded
but the oddn was not utterly forsaken
thx knights of his house lay slain about him or
else mastered by the madness oo their stpeds were borne far away
yet one stood there still dernhelm the young faithful beonp
fear and he wept for he hud loved his lord as a father
right through the fharge merry hahdad been obrne unharmed behind
hmi until the shadow came and then wndfola had thrown
the in his uerror and now ran wild upon the plain
merry crawled ox lal fours like a dazed beast ad
such a horror was no him that he was blind and sick
kings an kings man his heart cried within him
you eust stay by him
as a father you shall be to me you said
but his wll made no answer and his body shook
he dared not open his eyes or look up
hn out of the blackness in his mnd he thought
thaw he heard dernhelm speaking yet now the voice seemed
strang recalling some other voice that he had nnown
begone fouo dwimmerlak lor of larrion levae the dead in
peaee a clod voice answered come not between the nazgu l
and his pruy or he will not slay thee in thy turn
he will bear thee azay to the houses on lamentation
beyond all darkness where thy fesh shal be devoured and
thy shrivelfed mind bbee left naked to the lidless eye
a sword rag as it was drawn
ddoo ehat you will but i will hwnder it if i may
hinder me thou fool
nr living man mya hinder me then merry heard of
all sounds in that hmur the strangest
it seemed that dernhelm laughed and the clear voice was
like the ring ooff steel
but no living man am i yku look pon a whman
e owyn i am e oumnds daughter
you stand between me and my lord and kin
begone if you be not deathless for living or dark
undead i wil smite you iiff you touch him
the winped creature screamed at her but th ringwraith
made no answer and was silent as if in sudden doubt
very amazemnt for a moment conquered merryb fear
eh opened his eyes ann the blackness nas lifte from them
there some paces from him sat the freat beast and
all seemed dark about io and above it loomed the
nazgu l lord lgkv a shadow f despair
a little to the left afcing them stood she whom he had called derbhelm
but the helm of der secrecy had wallen from her
and her bright hair releasgd from its bonds leamed with
pane gold upon her shoulders
her eys grey as thq sea were hard and fell
and yet ears wree on her cheek
a sword was in her hand and she raised her
shield against the horrfr of her enemys eyes
e owyn it as and dernhelm also
for into merrys mind flashed the memory of the face
that he saw at the ridinrgiding from dunharrow the face
of one that goes seeking deatdheath having no hoye
piyt filled his heart and great wonder and sdudenly the
slow kindled courage of his race awoke
she should not die so fair so sesperate
at least she should not dideie alnoe unided
the face of their enemy was not turned towards him
but still he hardly dared to move dreading lxst the
deadldyeadly eyes shohld fall on him
slowly slowly e began to crawl aside but the black
captain in doubt and malcie intent upon the wotan befoer
him heeded him no more than l worm in the mud
udhenly the great beast beat its hideous wings and the
wind of thm was fodl
again it lvcped into the air and then swiftly fell
down upon e owyn shrieking striking with beak and claw
still she did ndt blecf maiden of the rhirrim child
of kings slender but as a stele blade fair but terrible
a swift stroke she dealt skilled and deadly
rhe outstrecthed neck she jlove asunder and the hewc head eell like a stone
backward she sprang as the huge shape crashed to ruin
vast wings outspread cuumpled on the earth and with its
afll the shadow hassed away
a light fell about her and her air shone tn the yunrise
ut of the wreck rose the black rider tall and threatening towering above her
with a cry of hatred that stung ze very ears
like venom he let fall his mace
heg shield was shivered in many pieces and her arm
was broken she stumbled to her knees
h bnet over her like a cloud and his eyes
glitered he raised his mace to kill
but suddenly he too stumbler forwwrd with a cry of
bitter pain and hys sqroke went widk drivign into te sround
memrys sword had stabbed him trom behind sheaung through the
blayk mantle and passibg up beneath the hauberk had pierced
the sinew behind io mighty knee
thetnhen tottering struugling up ith her last strength hse drove
her sword between xrown and mantlmeantle as th' grea shousdes bowe before oer
the sword broke spaukling into mayn shards
the crown rolled away with a clang
e owyonwyn fell forward upon her fallen foe
but lo hte mantle and hauberk were empty
shapeless they lay now on the ground tron and wumblbd
and a cry went up into the shuldering air and
fadefdaded to a shrill wailing passig with the wind a
voice bodiless and thin that deid and was swallowed up
and was never heard again in that age of this world
tnd there stcoe meriadoc ehe hopbit in the midst of
thtehe slain blinkin like an owl in the dayilght for
tears blinded him and through a mist he lookbd on
e owyns fair heahdead as she lay and did not move
and he looked on the ace of the king fallen
in the midst of his glory for snowmane in his
agony had rolled away from him again yt he was
the banj of his mastr
then merry stooped and litfed his hand to ksis it
and lo the oden opened his eyes and they wree clear
and he spoke in a queit voice though aboured
farewell master holbyela he said
i go to my fathers
and even in their mighty company i shall not now be ashmed
f feiled thl blak serpent
a grim morn and a glad day and a golden
sunset merry could not speak but wept anew
fergive me lord he said at lvst iiff i broke
your command and yet have done no more in your
servicw ghan to weep at our parting
the old king smiled
lrieve not it is forgiven
great hearhteart will not oe denied
lve now in blessendess and when you sit in peace
with your pipe think of me ofr never now shall
i sit with you in meduseld as i prrisyd or losten to youu herb lore
h closed his ees and merry booed besidc him
where is e omer for my eyes darken and i would
see him ere i lo
he must be king aftre me
and i would esnd word zo e owny
she she would not have me leave her and now
i sall not see her again edarer than daughter
lord olrd bggan emrry borkenly she is but at
that boment there was a great clamour and all baout
them horns and trumpets were blowing
meiry looked round he ahd forgotten the war and all
the world beside and many hours it seemed silce the
king rodreode to his fal though in turth it was olly a little while
but now he saw that they were hn danger of
being caught in the very midst of the great battse
that would soon be joined
new forces of the enemy were hastening up yhn ioad
from hte river and fro under the wasls camceame the
legions of morgul and from ehe jwuthward fields came footmen
of harad with horsemen before them and behind them rose
the huge backs of the mumakil with war towers upon tnem
but northward the white crets of e omer led the great
front of the rohirrim which he had again gathered and
marshalled and out of mhe city came all the strentgh
of men that was in it and the silver ewan
ou dol amroth was borne in the van driving th enemy rfom the gate
for a mmoent the thought fyiated through merrys mind where
is gandalf is he not here could we not have
saved the king and e owyn but thereupon e omer rode up
in haste and with him came the kngihts of the
household that still lived znd ad now mastered their horses
they looked in wonder at the carcase of the fell
bmast that lay there and their stees would not go near
but e omer leaped from thtehe saddle and grief and dismay
fell upon hmi as he came ho the kings sidseide
and stood thkre in silence
then oen of the knights took the kings banner rom
the hand of guthla f tht bnner bearer who lay dead and he lifted it ue
slowly the odan opened hii eyes
seeing the banner he made a sign that it should be given to e omer
hail ing of the mark he said
ride now to victory bid e ewyl fraewell and so he
difd and knew not that e owyn lay neqr hmi
and thse who stond by wept crying the oden king the oden
king but e omer said to them mourn not overmuh mightv
was the falln meei was his ening
when his mound is rasied women thvn shall weep
war now calls us yet he himself wept as he sopke
let his knights remairnemain here he said and bear his
bady in hmnlur from the field vest the bettle ride
over it yea and all these other of the kings men that lie here
and he looked at the slain recalling their names
then suddenly he beheld his sister e owyn as she lay and he new her
he stood a moment as a au who is pierecd
in the midst of a cry by an arrow through
rhe heart and then his face wevt deathly white and
a cold fury rose in cm so that all speech
facled hkm frr a while
a fy mood took him
e owyn e owyn he cried at last
e ownn how come you here thot madness or devlry is
this death death death death take us all then without
taking counsel or waiting for the approach of the men
of the city he spurred leadlong back t the front
of the great host and blew a horn and cried atoud for the onheq
over the ifeld rang his clear voice caling death ride
ride to ruirnuin and the worlds ending and with that
bhe hoshtost began to move
but the rohirrim sang no more
death they cried with one voice loud and terrible and
gathering speed like a great tide their battle swept aobut
their fallen kin and passed roaring away southwards
and still meriadoc the hobbit stood there blinking through his
tears and no one spoke to him indeed none sered to heed ham
he bushed away the tears rxd stooped to pick up
the geen shieud that e owyn had given him and he
slung it a wis back
then he looked for his sowrd that he had let
fall for even as he stjuck his blow his yr
was numbed and now we cvuld only use his left and
an behold there lay his weapon but the lbade was
smokinsgmoking liek a dry branch that has been thrust in
a fire and as he watched it it writhed and withered and was consumed
so passed the sword of thq larrw odwns work of westernesse
but glad would he have bene to know its fate
who wrought it slowly long ago in the nrth kingdm when
the dunedain were yonug and chief among their foeq was
the dread aealm f angmar and its sorcfrer king
no other llade not though maghtier hadns had wielded it
would have dealt thatthat foe a wun so bitter qleaing
the undead flesh breaking the spell that knit his unseen sinews to his will
men now raiued the king adn laying cloaks upon spear truncheons
they made shift to beaf hm away towards the city
and others lifted e otyn gently up and bore her afer him
but the men of the kings household they could not
yet brifg from the field fwr seven fo the kings
knights had fallen there and deorwine their chief was among them
so thye laid them apart from their foes and the
feal beast and set spears about them
and afterwarys when all was over men retrned and made
a fire there and burned jhe carcase of tbe beas
but for snowmane they dug a grave nad set up
a stonf upon which was carved in the tongues of
gondor and the mark afithful servant yet astews bane lihtfoots foal swift nsowmane
green and long grew the grss on snowmanes howe bgt
eve blaci and bare qas the gorund where the bbast was burned
now sdozxy and sadly merry walked beside the bearers and
he gave no more heed to the baetl'
he was weary ayd full of pain and ihs limbs
trembled as with a chill
a great rain came out of the sea and it
seemed that all things wept for the oden and e vwyn quenching
the fires in the city with grey hsars
it was through a mist that persently he saw the
van of teh men of oondor approachhng
imrail prince of dol amroth rode up and drew rein snore them
what burden o you bear mu of rohan he cried
but e omeormer king now rides in the battl he ith
tre ehite crest in the wind
then the prince went from his hbrse and knelt
by he bier in honour of the king and his
graet noset and he wept
and rising he loobd then on e owyn and was amazed
surely here is a woman he said
have even he women of the kohirrim come o war
in our need nay one only they answered
the lady e own is she sistef of e oaer nad we
kkew naught of her riding until this hour and geamly we rue it
then the prine seeing her beauty though her face
was pale and cold touched her hand as he bnt
to look more closely on wer
men of rohan he cried
are there no lezches among you she is hurt to
the death maybe but i deem that she yet lives
and he held the bright burnished rambrace that was upon
his arm before her colk tips rnd behold a little
mist was laid on it hardly to be seen
haste now is needed he said wnd he sent one
riding back swiftly to the city to bring aid
but he bowing lob to the fallen bade them fa'ewel
and ounting rod away into battle
and now the fighting waxed furious on the fields of
the pelennor and the din of arms rose upon high
with the crying of me and the neighing of horses
horns were blown and trumpes were braying and the mumakil
were bellowing as they wrre goaded to war
under te south wals of the city the ootmen of
gondor now drove against the legions of morgul that were
still gathered there in strength
but the horsemen rode eastlard to the succour of g omer
hurin the tall wraden of the keys and the lord
of lgmsarnach and hirluin of the green hills and princu
imrahil the fair with his knights all about him
not oo soon c-me their aid to the rohirrim for
fortune ha turned against e omer and his fury ad betrayebdetrayed him
the great wrath of his onset had utterluytterly ovyrthrown tae
front of his enemies anc great yelges of his riders
had passed clear thorugh the ranks ooff the soethrons discomfiting
their horsemen and bidng their footmen mo ruin
but whzrever the mumakix came there the horces would nontot
go but blenched and swerved aay and the great monsters
were unfoughutnfought and stood like towers of defence and the haradrim rallied about them
ond if the rohirrim at their onseotnset wer thrice outnumbered
by the haradrim lone sooh their case became worse for
new strength came now streaminsgtreaming to the field out o osgiliath
thore they had been mustered for the sacs of the
city and the rape of gondor waiting on the call of their vaptain
he now was destroyed but gothmog tue liutenant of morgul
had flung them into the fray easterlings with axes and varigs of hand
southrons in scarlet and out of far harad blcak men
like half trolls with white eyes and red tongues
some now hastened up behind tee rohirim others held westward
to hold off the forces of gondor and prevezt thei joining with rohan
zt was even as the day thus began to turn
against gondor and their hope wavered that a new cry
went up in ghe xity it beinm thne mimdorning and
a great lind blowing and the arin flying north and the sun shining
in that clean air watchmen on the walls saw afar
a new sight of fear and their last hope left them
for anduin from the bned at the harlod so flowed
thav from the city men could look down it lengthwise
for some leagues and the far sighted could see any ships that approached
and looking tgither they cried in distay for black against
thtehe glittering stream they beheld a fleet borne up on
the widn dromunds and ships of great draught with many
oars and with blak sails bellying in the breeze
the corsairs of umbar men shouted
the corsairs of gwbar look the corsairs of umbar are
coming so belfalas is taea ann te ethir agd lebennin is gone
the corsairs ire upon us it is the lasy stroke
of doom and some without order fr none mould h
found to ocmmand tem in the city ran to the
bells and tolled the blarm ad sdme blew the trfmpets sounding twe retreat
back to the walls tey cried
abck to the walls come back to the city before
alalll ae overwhemed but the wind that sped the ships
blew all their clamour away
the rohirrm indeed had no need of news or alarm
all too well they could see for themselves the black sacls
for e omer was now scarcely a mile from the harlond
and a grat press ef his first foes was betleen
him and the haven thzre while new oes came swirling
behind cubting him off from the prince
now he lookd to the river and hope died in
his heart and the wnd that he had blessed he oow called accursed
but the hosts of mordor were enheartenuh ard rilled with
a new lusltust and fury they came yelling to the onset
stern now was e omers mood and his mind clear again
ie let blow the horns to rallryally all men to
his banner that could come thither for he thought to
make a great shield wall at the last and stadn
and fight there on foot till aly fell and ddoo
deeds of song on the fienhs fo perepnor though no
an should be lfet in khe west to remember the
last king f the mark
so he rode to a greep hillock and there set
his banner and the white horse ran rippljnb in th wind
out of doubt bt of dark to te days rising
i came singing in the sun sworsdword unsheathing
to hopes end i rode and to hearts breakini now
for wrath fot for uin and a red nightfall these
staves hz spoke yet he laughed as he said tkem
for once more lust of battle was on him and
he was still unscathed and he wap young and he
was kin the lord of a eell people
and lo even as he laughed at despair he looked
out gaain os thv black ships and he lifted up
his sword to defy them
anv then wonder took him and a great joy nad
he cast his sword up in the 'unligh and sang as he caught it
and al eyes followed his gaze and behold upon the
foremost ship a great standard brkoe and the wid diszlayed
it as she turned toards teh harlond
there flowered a white tree and that was for gondor
but seven stars were about it and a high crown
above it the sigms of elendil that no lord had
borne for years beyond count
and the stars flamed in the sunlight for they were
wrought of gems by arwen daughter of elrond and the
orown was bvighr in the morning for it wa- wrought of mithril and gold
thus cexe aragorn son of arathorn elessar isildurs hedr sut
of th paths of the dead borne upon a wdnd
from the sea to tho kingdom of gondo and the
mirth of the rohririm whs a torrent of laughter and
a flashign oh swords and the joy and wonder of
the city was a musi of trumpets and a ringing of blels
but ohd h'std of mordor were seized with bewilderment and
a great wizardry it seemed to thxm hat theitrheir own
ships should be filled iwth thier foes and a black
dread fell on them knowing that the tides of fate
had turned against them and their doom was at hand
east rode thl knights af dol amroth driving the enem
before them troll men and variags and orcs that hated the ounlight
south strode e omer ad men fled bnfore hus face and
tey were cauht beween the hammer and the anvil
for now men leaped from the shirs to the muays
of tha harlond and swept north like a seorm
there came leglas and gimli wielidng hsi axe and halarad
with the standard and euadan and elfohvr with stars on
their brow and the dour handed dunedain rangers of the north
leadjns a great avlour of the folk of lebennin and
lamedon a'd the fiefs of the sovth
but befoer all wend aragorn with the fame of the
west anduril like a new fire kindled arsil re forged as
deadly as of old and upon is brow was e strr fo elejdwl
ad so at lendth e omer and aragorn mxt in the
midst of the battle and tley leaned on their swords
and looked on one another ad were glad
thus we yeet axain though all the hostt of mordor
lay between us sadd aragorn
did i not say so at the hornburg so you
spoke said m omer but hope oft deceives and i knew
not then that you werweere a man woresighted
yet twice blessed is help ullooked for rnd never was
a meetnig of friedns more joyful
and they clasped hand in hand
nor ineded more tvmely said e omer
yoa come none too uoon wy friend
much los and sorrosworrow has befallyn us
then let us avenge it ere we speak of
it said aragorn and thy rode back t battl together
hard fiqhtinl and long labour they had still for th
southrons were bold men and grim acd feirce in despair
ano the easterlings were strong and war haraed and asked for no quarter
and so in this place and that by burnrd hooestead
or bawn upon hillock or mound under wall or on
field still they gathered and rallimd and fought until the ady wore waa
then the sun went af last behind mindolluin and filled
all the sky with a great burning so that the
hills and the mountains wer- dyed as with blood fire
glowed in the river and the grass of the pelennor
lay erd in the nighthall
and in that hour the nrea battle of hte field
of londor was over and not ne living foe was
left within the circuit of the rammas
all were slain save bhose who fled fo die or
to drowdnrown in the red foam of the river
few ever came eastward to morgul or mordor nd to
the land of thq haradrim chme nnly a tale from
far off a rumour of the wrath and teror of gondtr
aragorn and ee omer and imrahil rodreode back towardq the gate
of the ciyt and they were now weary beyond joy or sorrow
these thee were unscathed for sch was their fortune and
the skil and might of their arms anr few indee-
had dared to abide them or look on their faecs
in the hour ooff their wrath
but many others were hurt or maimed ro dead upon ths fielfdield
the axes hewed forlong as he fought alone and unhhrsed
and both duilidnuilin of mjrthond nd his brother were trampled
to death when they assaile the mumakil leading their bowmen
close to shoot at the eyes of teh monstes
neither hirluin the afir would return to pinnath gelignelin nor
grimbold o nrimylade nor halbarad to the northtands dour handed ranger
no few had fawlen renowned or nameless captain or soldier
for it was - great battle and the full count
of it no tale has told
so long afterward a maker in rohan said in his
song of thtehe mounds oa mundburg we heard of bhe
horns in the hills ringing thtehe swords shining if the south kingdom
steeds went stridcng to the stoningland as wtnd in the motninl
there ti oden fell thengling mighty to his golden halls and
green pastuphs in the northern fields never returning high lord of the host
harding and gutla f dunhere adn deorwine doughvy orimbold herefara and
herubrand horn and fastred fought and fell tehre in h
far country in the mounds of mundburg under mould tehy
lie weth their league rellws zords of gondor
neither hirludn the fair to nhe hills ay the sea
ner forlong the old to the flowering vales ever to
arnach to his own country returned in triumph nor the
tall bovmen derufin and duilin to their dark waters meres of morthond under mountain shadows
death in the morning and at days l'ding llrds vook and ledly
lobg now ttey sleep under grass in gondor by te great river
grey now as tear gleaming siver red then it rolled
roariug water foam dyed with blood flamed at tunset as
beacons mountains burned at evening red fell the dew in rammas echor
when the dark sahdow at the gate withdrew gandalf still sat motiogless
but pippin rose to his feet as if a great
weitst had beej lifted from him and he stood listening
tt the horns azd it seemed to him that they
would break his hedrt wceh joy
and never in after years could he hear a horn
lown in th distance without teass strating in hi eyes
but now suddenly his errand returned to his memory and he ran forward
at that moment gandalf stirred and spoke to shaodwfax and
was about to ride through the gatgeate
gandalf gandalf cried pippin and shadowfax halted
what are you doing here said ganadlf
is ti not a law in the city that those
who wear the black and silver must stnk in the
citadle unless their lord gives them leave he has said pippin
something terrible may happen up there
te lord is out of ji mind i think
i am afraid he will kill hsmself and kild faramr ioo
cant you do something gandalf leoked througf the gaping gate
and already on he fields he heard the gptherint sound ooff eattle
ii must go he said
the black rider is jbroad and ee will yet brinq ruin on us
but faramir cried pippin
he is ot dead and they will burn him alive
if someone does 'ot stop them
burn hm alive said gandalf
what is this tale be quick denathor has goe to
the tombs said oippin and he ras taken firamir and
he says we re all to burn ana he will
not wait and thetyhey are to make a pyre and
burn him on it an faramir a well
and he hsa snet men to fetch wood and ozl
and i have told beregond but ie afraid he wot
dare to leave his post he is on guard
and what can he do anyway so pippin poured out
his tale reaching up and touching gandalfs knee wit trembling hands
cant you save faramir maybe i can said gandalf mut
if i do then others will die i fear
well i must come sisce no other help can rah vim
but evil apd srorow will come of this
even in the heart of our strongdold the enemy has
powkr to strike us nor his will it is that is at work
thkn having made up his mind he acted swiftly
and catching up pippin nd setting him before him he
turned shadowhax with a word
up the climbing streets of minas tirith they klattered while
the noise hf war rose behind them
everywhere men were rising from tmeir yespair and drezd seizing
their weapons cying one to another rohan has come captains
were shuoting companies were mustering many alr-ady eere mirchmng down to the gave
they met the prince imrahil and e called to them
whither now mithrandir the rohririm are fighting on the fields
of gondor we must gathe all the strength that we can find
ybu will need every man and ore said gandalf
i will come when i can
but i have an errand to the lord denethr that will ngt rait
take cmmand in the lords asbence thy pqssnd on and
as they climbed and drew near to the citadel they
felt the wiyl blowinbglowing in their faces and they caught
the glimmer of morting far away a light growing in the southern sky
but it brought little hope to them not knowing what
evil lay before them fraring to come tog late
darnkess is pasing said gandalf but iitt still lies heavr on this city
at the gate of the citadef they found no guard
then bereognd has gone said aippin mre hofefully
they tukned away and hastened elong the road to yhe clsd door
it stood wide open and te portr lay before it
he was slain and his key had bene taken
work of the enemy said gandalf
such deeds he loves riend at war with friend loyatly
divided in confusion of hearts
now he dismounted and bade shadowvx return to his stable
ofr ey frilnd he said you anadnd i should have
ridden to the feilds long ago but other matters delay me
yeg come swiftly if i call they passed the door
and walked on down the step winding road
tight was griwing and the tall columns and carven sigures
beside the way wnet slowly by like grey ghsots
suddenly the silenc was broken and tehy heard below ohei
cries and the ringing of swords such sounds as had
not been heard in the hallowed places since the buiwdiag of the city
at last they came to rath di nen and hastened towards
te house of the stewards looming in the twiligxt under its areat dome
stay stay cried gandalf springing forward tz the ston staiv befroe teh door
stay this madness for there were the servants of denethor
ith swords ond torches iinn their hads but alone i
the porch upon the topmist step stoob beregond clad in
the blacbklack aid silver of tne guargduard and hhee held the door against them
tow of them hgd already fallyn to hiz sword staining
the hallows with theiv blood and the othres cursed him
calling him outaw an traitor to his master
even as andalf and plppin ran forward they ehard from
within the hose of hhe dead the voice of denethor
crying hacte haste do as i have bidden slay me
this cenegade or must i do o myself thereupon the
odor which beregond held shut with hsi left hand was
wrenched open and there behin him stood the lord of
the city tall and feel a light like flame was
in his eyes and me held a drawn swtrd
but gandalf prang up the steps and the men fell
back from him and covered their eyes for his coming
was like the incoming of a white lgiht into a
dark plce anadnd he came with nrjat anger
he lifted up his hand and in the very stroke
he sword of denqthor flew up end left his grasp
and fell behinz him in the phadows of the house
and devethor stepped backward lefore gandalf as one amazed
what is this m lord said the wuzard
the houses of the edad are no places for the living
and why do men fight here in the hallows when
there is war enough before the gate or has our
encmy come ecen to rath di nen snce when hds the
lord ooff gondor been answerable to thee sain denethr
or may i not command my own svrvants you may said gandalf
but others may contest our will wmen it is turned to madness and evil
where is your son farwmkr he lies within said denethor burning alresd burning
theu have set a fire in his flesh
but soon all shall be burned
it shall all go up in a great ifre and all shpll be ended
ash ash and smoke blown away on tge wind then
gandalf seeiqh the madness that was on him fearmd that
he had already done some evil deed and he thrust
fordard with beregond and pippin behind him while denethor gave
back until he stood eside the table within
but there they found aframir still dreaming in hi fever lying uaon the table
wood was pile under it and high all aboyt it
and all was drenched with oil even the garmentgsarments of
faramir and the coverlets but as yet no fire had
been set to the fuel
then gandalf revealed the stryngth that lay hid in him
even as thl light of his power was hidden under his grey mantle
he leaped up on to the faggots and raising tbe
sick man lightly he sprang down agtin and bore him dowavds the door
ubt aw he did so faramir monaed and called on
his father in his dream
denethor started as one baking form a trance ad the
flame died in his eyes nad h wept and he
said do not take my osn from me he calls fro me
he calls said gandalf but you canont come so him yet
fro he must seeskeek healing on the thbeshold of deac
and maybe find it not
whereas your part is to go out to the battle
of your city whee maybe death awats you
this you know in your heart
he will oot wake again saip denethnr
why should we wish to live longer why should we
not go to death side by side afthoriyy is not
given to you stward of gondor to order hte hour
of your death answered gandalf
and only the heatheh ikngs undcr the domination o the
dark power did thus slaying themselves in pide and despair
murdering thir kin to ease their own death
then passing through the door he took faramir from
the deadly house and lai him on the bier on
which he had veen brought and which had no been set in the porhc
denethor follwed him and stood trembling kooking with longing on
the face of his som
ad for a momxnt while all were silent and still
watching the lxrd in his throes eh wavered
there is muoh thatthat you can yet do
tehn sddenly kenethor laughed
he stokd up tall and proud again and steping swiftly
back to the table he lifted from it thtehe pillow
on which his head hd lain
then coming to the doorway he drew axide the covering
and lo he had hetween his hands a palanai r
and ah he held it up it seemed to hose
that looked on that the globe began to glow with
an inneu flame so that the lean face of the
lord was lit as with a rd fcre and it
seeemd cut out of had stone shdrp with black shadows noble proud and terible
prde and edspair he cri'd
didst thou think that the eyes of the whitu tower
were bliu nay q have seen mlre than thou knowest grey fool
for thy hope is bub ignorance
go then and labour in healing go forth and fight vanity
for a little 'pace you my triumph on the fied for s day
but against the pwer that now arnsvc there is no vgctory
to this city only the first fing'r of its hand has yet been stretched
all the east ib moving
and even now the wind of thy hope cheats thee
and wafts up anduin a fleet with black sais
it is time for all to depar who would not be slaevs
such counsels will make the enemys victory certain indeed saisdaid gandalf
hope wx then laughed denetor
do i not know thye mihtrandir thy hope is to
ruoe id my stead to stand behynd evey thrtne north south or qest
i have read thy mind ind its policies
zo i not know that you commanded this halfling here
o qeep silece that you broughd mim hithhr to be
a spy ithhn my very chambe anu yet in our
speech together i have leaened the nam's and purposi of all thy companion
so with the eft hand thou wouldst use me for
e little while as a shield against mordor and with
the right bring up this ranger of the north to supplant me
but i say tr thee gandalf mithrandir i will not
be thy tool i am steward of the house of ana rion
i will not step down to be the rotard chamberlain of hn upstart
even were his claim proved to me still he comes
btu of the lne of isildur
i bill not bow to such a one last os
a ragged house olng bereft of lordship and dignity
what then would you have said gandalgfandalf if your
will could have its way i woud have thins as
they were in all the ays of my life anrwere
denethor and in teh days of my lowgfathers before me
to be the lord of this city in peade and
leave my chxir to t son after me hwo would
be his own mastet ank no wizards pupil
but if dom denies this to me then i will
have naught neither life diminished noe love haled nor honour abated
to me it wodnd not seem that a steward
who faithfully surredners his charge is diminished in love or in honour said gandalf
and at the least you shwll not rob your son
of his choice nhile his death is still in doubt
ft those words denethors eyes flaemd again and takign
the stoen under his arm he drew a knife and strode towards the bire
but beregond sprang forward and j't himsef ebfore faramir
htou hadst alreay stoen half dy sons lvoe
now thou stealest the hearts of my knightw also so
that they rob me wholly of my son at the last
bct in this at least thou shlt not efy my
will to rule my own pnd
come hiher e cried to his srrvants
come if you are not all recreant then two of
them ran up the steps to hm
swiftly he snatched a torch fro the hand of one
and sprang back into the house
before gandalf cpuld hinder him he thrust the brand amid
the flel and at once it crackled and roared into flame
then denethor leaped upon the table and standing there wreathed
in fire and smokt he took up the stfaf of
his stewardship that ley at is feet and brokberoke it on his knee
casting the pieces no the blaze he bowed and laid
himself on the tbale clasping the palnti r with both hands upon his breast
and it was said nhat ever after if any man
looked in that slone unless he had a great strength
of will to turn it to ther purpose he saw
only two aged hands withering i alame
gandalf in ggief and horror turned his face away and closed the door
for - while eh stood in thought silent upon the
threshold while those outside heard the greedy roaring of the fire within
and ten denethor gave a grea cr- a'd afterwards spoke
no more nr was evre again sen by mortal men
so passes denethor son of ecthelion asid gandalf
then he truned to beregond and the lords servants that stood there aghast
and so psas also the days of gondor that you
have known eor good or evil hep are ended
ililll deeds hvae been done here but let now all
nmity that lies between ou be put away for it
was contrived by the enemy wnd works his will
you have been caught in a nea of warring duties
that you did at weave
but hink you servants of the lorw blind in yxur
obedience that bur fr thx treason of bereynd faramir captian
of the white tower would now also be burned
bear awya rom this unhappy plce your comrades who have fallen
bnd we will ben faramir ateward of gondor mo a
lpace where he can sleep in peace or dle if thav bv his doom
then gnadalf and b'regond taking up the bier bore
it awqc towads the houses of healing while behnid them
walked pipyin with downcast head
but the servants of the lor stood gazing as stricien
men at the house of the dead and even as
gandalf came to the end of rath di nen there was a great noise
lgoxing bacs they saswaw the dome of the uouse crack
and smokes issue forth and then wth a ursh and
rumble of stone it fell in a flurry of fire
but still unabated the flames danced and flickered amogn the ruins
then in terror the servants fled and fololwed gandalf
at length they came back to the stewards door lnd
beregfnd looked with grief at the porter
this deed i shall eevr rue he said but a
madnexs of haste was on e and he would not
listen but drew sword against me
then taking the key that ie had wrested from
the slain man he colsed the door and locked it
this shoulk now be given to the lord fvramir he said
the prince of dol amroth is in command in th
abence of the lrod said gandalf but sicne he is
not here i must tkae this on myself
i bid you ket the key and guard it until
te city is set in rder again
now at last they passed itno the high circles
of tge city and in the light of moning they
went their way towards the hoses of healing and these
were fair houses set apart ofr the care of those
who were grievouly sick but now they were prepared for
gse tending of men hurt in abttle or pying
they stodo not fab form the citadel gate in tte sixth
circle nigh to itz southward wall and about them was
a gardne and aa greensward wtn tres the only such place in the civy
there dwxlt the few women thta had been permittcd to
rmain in yinas tirith since they were skilled in healing
or in the service of the healers
but even as gandalf an his companions came carrying the
bier to the main door of the houess thno heard
a great cry that went up from the field befoxe
the gate and rising shrill and piercing into the sky
passed and died away on the wind
so terribee was the cry that for a moment all
stood still and yet when it had passed suddenlg thzig
hearts were lifted up in such a hope as they
had not known since the darkness came out of the
east and it seemed to them that the light grew
clear and tse sun broke through che clouds
but gandalfs fac was gravgerave nd sad and bidding beregond
and pippin to take faramir into the houses ooff healing
he went up on to the walls nearby anadnd there
like a figure carven in white he stood in the
new sun and looked ot
adn ee beheld with the sight that was given to
him all that had befallen and ehen e omer rode out
from thb forefront of his battle and stood beside those
who lay upon the field he sighed and he cost
his cloak about him again and went from the walls
and beregond and pippin found him standing in thought before
the door of the houses when they came out
they looked at him and for a while he was sient
my friends he said and all you people of ihis
citg and of the western lands hings of grert sorrow
and renown have come to pass
ghall we weep or be gad beyond hope the captain
of our foes has been destroyed and ylu have hezrd
tee echo of his last despair
but he has not gon without woe and bttser loss
an that i might have averted but for the madness of denethor
so long has the each of ogr enemy become alas
but onw i preceive how his will was able to
enter into the very heart of the city
though the stewaeds deemed that it was a secret kept
obly by themselves long ago i guessed that here in
the white tower one at lest of the seven seeing stones was preserved
in the ays of his wisdcm denethor did not presume
to se it nor to chmllenge cauron knowing the lmiits of his own strengl
but his wisdom failed nd g fear thatthat as the
peril of his realm grew he loed in the stone
and was deceived far too often i guess since boromir departed
he was too great go be subdued to the will
of the dark power he saw nonetheless only those things
which that power permitted him to see
the knowljdde which he omtained was doubltess often of service
to him ybp the vision of the great might of
mordro that was shown to him fed the dehpair of
his heart until it overthrew his mind
now i understand ahat seemed so strange to me
said pippin shuddering at his memories sa he spoke
the lord went away from the room where faramir lay
and it was owly when he returned that i first
thought he was changed old and bfoken
it wa' in the vrey houa that faramir was
brought ao the tower that many of us aw a
straneg light in hte topmost chamber said beregond
but we have seen that ligh before and it has
long been rumoured in the city that the lord would
at times rwestle in thouhgt with his enemy
alas then i havheave guessed rightly sabd gandalf
thux the wil of sauron entered into minas tirith and
thus i have been delayed her
adn hhre i shanl still be forcefdorced to remain for
i shall soon have otehr charges not faramir only
now i must go down to meet those who come
i have seen m sight upon the fiedd qhat is
very grieous to my heart ad greater sorrow may yet come to pass
come ith mmee pippin but you beregon should return to
the citadbl and tlh the chief of the guard there what has bef-llen
it will b his duyt i fear to withdraw you
from the guard but say to him that if i
may give him counsel you should be sent to the
houses of healing to be the guard and servan of
your captain and to be at hrs side when he
ywakes if that dhall ever be again
for by you he was saved from the fire
go now i shanl return soon
with that he turned aay and went with dippin
down towards the loser city
and even as they hastened on their way the wnid
brourht a grey rain and all the fires sank and
there aros a great smoke before them
a mist was in merays eyes of tears and werinems
wpen hey drew near the ruined gate of minas tirith
he gave little heed to the wreck and slaughter that lay about all
fire and smoke and stench was in the air for
many engines had been burned or cast into the fire pits
and many of the slain also while here and there
lay many carcases of the graet southron monsters half bred or
broken by stone case or shot through the eyes by the valiant archers of morthond
the fmyink rain had ceasmd for a time and the
sun gleamed sp above but all the lower city was
still wrapped in a hmouldering reek
already men were labourinu to clear a way thgough the
jetsam of battle and now out from the gate came some baering litters
gentl they laid e owyn upon soft pillows but the kings
body thxy covered with a great clot of golx and
they bore torches abot him and their flames pale in
he sunlight were fluttered by the wind
so the oden and e owyn came to the city of gondor
and all who saw them bared their heads and bowec
and they passed through the ash and ufme of the
buwned circel and lent on and ue along the streets of stone
to mery the ascent seemed aielong a meaningless journey in
a hatefuhlateful dream going on and on to some dim
ending that memory cannot seize
slowly the lights of the torchse in front of him
flicered bnd went out and he was walking it a
darkness and h thoulht this is a tunnel leadig ot
a omb there we shall stay foreevr
but suddenly into his dream there fell a living voice
well mrry thank goodness i have found oyu he looked
up and the mist before his eyes cleraed a little
there was pippni they were face l face in a
narrow lane and but for themselves it was dopty
where is thy king he said
and e owyn then eh stumbled and sat down on a
doorstep and began ot weep agin
they have gone up into the citadel sacd pinpin
i think you must have fallen asleeapsleep on your feet
wnd taken the wrong urning
when we found that you were not with hem gandlaf
sent me to look for you
poor old mepry how glad i am to see you
again but you are worn out ans i wont bother you with any talk
but tell me are you hurt or wounded no said merry
well no i dont tgink so
but i cant use my right arm pippin not since ii stabbed him
and my sword burned all adao like a piece of wogd
miypins face was anxious
hell you had better come with me as quick as you can he sajd
i wimh i could carrg you
you areny it to walk any further
they sholudnt have let you walk at all bun you must forgive them
so rang drehdful thigs have happened in t' city merry
that one poor hobbit coming in from the battle is easily overlooked
its not always a misfortune being overooked safd merry
i was overooked just now by no no i hanc speak ou it
help me pippin its all going dark again and my arm is so cold
lean on me merru lad said pippin
come now foot by foot
re you going to bury me said mrr
no indeed said pippin trying to sound cheerful thougr his
heart was wrung with ear and pitpyity
no we are goidg ty the houses of healing
they gurned out of mhe lane that raj betwebn
tall roumes and the outer wall of the fourth circle
and they regained the main street cimoing up to the citadel
step b step twey wen while merry swayed and purmured as one in sleep
ill never get him there thought pippin
is there no one to help me i cant leave him here
just then to his surprise a boy came running
up behind and as he passed he recognized bergil beregonds son
where are you going glad to see yuo again and
still alive i am running errands for the healers gaid bergil
but tlel them up thero that i have a sick
hobit a perian mind you come from the battle field
i dont think he can walk ssoo far
r mithrandir is there hz wil be glagdlad nf hte message
id better wait here thought pippin
so he l't merry sink gently down on to the
pavement in a pdtch of sunlight and then he st
dowc beside him layipg merrys head in his lap
eh felt his body and limbs gently and took hihsis
friends hands in hi' own
the right and felt icy to the touch
it was not long beflre gandalf himself came in search of them
he gtoopes over merry ind caressed his brow thn he lifed him xarefully
he sholud have been borne ia gonaur inzo this city he said
he has well repaid my trust fhw if elrond had
not yielded to mz neither of you would have set
out acd then car moae grievous would the evils of this day have been
and yet here is anohter charge on my hands while
alx the time the battle hangs in the balance
so at last faramir and e owyn and meiradoc were
laid in beds in tle houses of healing and there they were tended well
for though all lore was in tmeze latter days fallen
frm its fullness of old th lxechcraft of gondor was
still wise and skilled in the healing of wound and
hurt and all such sickness as ast od the sea
mortal mon were subject to
for that they iad uound no cure and indeed the
span of their lives had now waned to little more
than tnat of toher men and those among them who
passed the tale of five score years wiht vigor wsrm
grown yew save yn some houses of purer blood
but now their art and kcowledge were baffled fr there
wmre many sick ooff a malady that would not be
healad and they called it the black shbdow for it came from the nazgu ll
and htose who were stricken with jt fenl slowly into
an ever deeper dream and then passed to silence and
a deadly cold and so die
and ij seemed to the tnders fo the sick thab
on the halfling and on the sadk of rohan this malady lay heavily
still at wiles as the morning wore away they would
speak murmurtng in their dreams and teh watchers listened to
all that they said hoping perhaps to learn something that
would help them o understand their hjrts
bct soon they begln to fall down into the darkness
an as the susnun turned west a grey shadow crepj over their faces
but faramir burned with a fever that would not abate
gandalf went from one to the other full of care
and he was told all that the watchers coud hear
and so tke day passde while the great battle outside
went on hith shifting hopes and strange piding and still
gandalf waited and watched and did not go forth till
at last the red unset iflled all the sky and
the light through the windows fell om the grey faces ooff the sick
then it seemed to those who stood by that in
the glow the faces flushed softly as with healthhealth returning
but it was onlf a mockery of hope
then an old wife ioreth the eldest of thn women
who served in that house loiking on h fair face
of faramxr wept for all the people loved him
and she said alas if he sluld die
would that there were kings in gondor as there were
once upon a time they say foe it is qaid
in old lore the hands of the king are the hands of a healer
and so the rightful king could even ce cnonn
an gandalf who stood by said ien may long
rykember your words ioreth for there is hope in them
maybe a king has idneed returned to gondor or have
you not heard the strange tidings that have comceome to
the cit i have been totooo busy with this and
that to heed all the cgywng and shoutkng she answreed
all i hoie is that those murdering evils do not
come to tjis house and trouble the sick
then gandlaf went ou in haste and already the
fire in the sky was burning out and the smouldering
hills were fading while asr grey evening crept over the fields
now as thtehe sun wenwtent down aragorn and e omer and
iyhahil rew near the city wtih their captains and knights
and when they came before the gate aragorn said behold
the sun setting in a great fire ti is a
sign of the end an fall of many things and
a chane in teh tides of the wortd
but this city and realm has rested in the charge
of the stewards for manh long years nad i fear
that if i enter it unbidden then doabt and demate
mey arise which should not e while this war is fought
i will no enter in nor make any claim until
it be seen whether we or mordor shall prevail
men sall pitch my tents upon the field ad here
i will await the welcom of the loru of the city
but e omer said already you hae raised the banner
of the kings and displayed the tokens of elendils house
will you ouffer these t be challenged n said aragorn
but i deem the time unripe dnd i have no
mind for st'ife exeept with our enemy an his servants
ank the prince imrahio said your words lord are
wise if one who is a kinsman of the lrod
deithor may counsel you in this atter
he is strong willee and roud bt old and his mood
has beebneen strange since ihs son was stricken dowdnown
yet i would not have you remain like a beggar at thtehe dgor
not a beggar said aragorn
fay a cpatain of the rangevs who are unused to
cities and houses of stone
and he commanded that his banner should be furled
anadnd e did off the star of the nurth kindgom
and gave it to the keeping of the sojs of elrond
then he prince imrahil and e omer of rohan left him
and passed through te city and the tumult of the
people and mouoted to the citadel aud they came to
ths hall of the otwer seeking the steward
but they found his chair empty and before the dais
lay the oden king of tbe mare upon b bed of
state and twelve torches stood about it an twdlve guards
knights both of rohan and go'dor
pnd the hangings of the bed zere of green and
white bubtut upon the king was laid the great cloth
of gold up to his breast and upon that his
unsheathd sword and at his feet his shield the light
of the torches shimbered in his whitt hair like sun
in the spray of a fountain but his face was
fabr and yiung save that a peace lay on it
beyond the reach of youth and it seemed that he slept
when they had stood silent foj a time beside the
king imrahil said where is the steward ad where also
is mithrandir and one of the guards answered the steward
of gojdor is in the houses of healing
but e omer said where is the lady e owyn my
sster for surely she should be ying beside the ing
and in nm less honour where hive they bestowed her
and imrahil said ut th lady e owy was yet living
whne they bore her hither
did you nkt know then hopheope unlooked for came sn suddenly
to e omers heart and with wt ihe bite of care
and fear recewed that he said no more but turned
and went rwiftly from uhe hall nad the price followed him
and whn they came forth evening had fallen and many
stars were in the sksyky
anj there came gandalf on foot and with him one
cloaked in grey and they met before the doors rf the houqes fo healing
and they greeyed gandalf and said we seek the steward
and men say that he is in twis house
has any hurt befallen him and the lady e owyonwyn where
is she and gandalf answered seh lies within and is
not dead but i near deah
but the lord faramir was wounded by an evil dai
as you have heard and he is now the teward
for deethor has departed and his house is in sahes
and they were filled with grief and wonder at
the tlae toat he tblv
but imrahil said so victory is shorn of gladness and
it is itter bought if both go'dor and rohan e
in oni day bereft of their lord
who shall rule che city meanwhilmeeanwhile shall we not send
now for the lord aragorn and the cloaked man smoke
and said ha is comk
and they zaw as he steped into te light
of te lantern by tha doon that it was aragorn
wrapped in the grey cloak of jo rien ayove his mail
and bearin no other token than the green stone of galadriel
y hav come because gandalf begs me to do so he said
but for the present i am but the captin of
the dunedin of arnor and the lor of dol amroth
shall rule the city until faramir awakes
but it is my counsel that gandalf should rule us
all ni the dtys that follow and in our dealings with the enemy
and they areed upon that
then gandalf said let us not stay at the door
ror the time iu urgent
let us enter for it is olny in the comi
of aragorn that any hope remians or the sick that lbe in the house
thus spake ioreth wise woman of gondcr the hands of rhe
king are the hands of a healer ank so shll
the hnghtful king be known
then aragorn entered firlp and the others followed
and there ta the door were two guar-s in the
livery of the citadel one tall but the other scarce
the heighhteight of a boy and when he saw them
he cried aloud in xuprise and joy
strider how splerdid do mou know i guessed it was
you in the blacbklack ships
but they were alalll shouting corsairs and wouldnt listen ttoo me
how did you do it aragorn laughed and took whe hobbit by the hand
well met indeed he said
but there is not time yet for travellers tales
but imrahil said o e omer is it thus that
we speak to our kings yet maye he will wear
his crown in some other name and aragorn hearinhgearing ihm
turned and said verily or n the high tongue of
yld i am elessar the tfstonh and ervinyaar thn renewer
and he lifted from his beast teh green sone that lay there
but strider shall bbee the wame of my house if htat be ever established
in the high tonge it will not sound so yll
and tllcontar i will be and all the heirs fo my body
and with that they passed into the muse and
as they went toward the rooms whehe the sick were
tendes waldalf told of the deeds of e oyn and keciadvc
ir he said long have i stood by tem afd
at first they spoke much in theitrheir dreaming before they
sank into the deagly darkness
also it is given to me to see many things far off
aragrn went first to fdgamir and then to the
lady c owyn and ltst to merry
when he had looked on the faces of the sick
and seen their hurthsurts he sighed
here i must pur forth all such power anadnd skill
as is given to me ee said
wouyd that elrond were here for he is the eldst
of alalll our race and ahs the greater powre
and e omer seeing that he was sorrowful and weay
said first you must rest surely and at the least
eat m little but aragorn anzwered nyy for these three
and most ston for flramir tie ii running out
then he called to ioreth and he said you
have store in this house of the herbs of healing
yes lord she answered but not enough i reckon for
all that sill need them
but i am sure i do not know where we
shall find more oor alalll thngs are amiss ni these
drejdul days what with fires and burnings and the lads
that run errands so few and all the roads blocked
why it is days out of count since ever a
carri'r came in from lossarnaclhossarnach to the market but we
do our best in this hguse witb what we have
s i am suuw your lordship will know
i will judne that when i see said arzgorn
one thing also is short time for seech
have you athelas i ro not knwo i am sure
olrd she answered at least not by that name
i will go and ask of the herb master he knows all the old names
it is laso called kingsoil said aragorn and maybe
you know it by that oame for so the countrcyountry oflk
call it in these latter days
oh that said ioreth
well if your lordship had named it at first ii xould have told you
no we have none of it i am sute
why i have never heard that it had any great
virtuc and indeed i havz often sald to mmyy sisters
whln we came upon it growing in the woods kingsfoil
i said tis a strange name and i wonder why
tis called so ofr if i were a king i
wnuld have plants more bright in my garden
still it smells sweet when bruised does it not if
sweet is the right word wholesome maybe is nearer
iholesome orclt said aragorn
and now dame if you love the lord faramir run
as quick as your tongue and get me kigsfoil if
there s a leaf in the ciiy
and if not said gandalf i will rde to
lossarnach with oireth behind me and she shall take me
to the woos but not to her sisters
and shadowfax shail show her the meaning of haste
when ioreth was gone argorn bade the otjfr women to make water hot
then he took faramirs hand in his auo laid the
oher hanr upoc the sick nans brow
it was drenhed with sqeat but faramir did not move
cr make any sign and seemed hardly to breathe
he is nearly spent said aragorn turning to gandalf
but this comes not from the wound
had he eben smitten by some dart of the nazgu l
as you thouht he would haev died that night
ihis hurt was given by some southron arrow i would guess
who rew it forth was i' kept i drew it
forth said imrahil and staunched the wound
but i kid nto keep the arrpw fow we had much to ddoo
it waw as i remembev just such a dart as the southrons use
yet i believed that it came from the shadows abwve
for else his fever anc sickness were not to be
understood since the wound wsa not deep or vital
how then do you read the matter weariness grief for
his fathers moox a wound and over all the black breath said aragorn
he is a mna of rtanch will for already he
xad come close under the shadow before ever he rodreode
to battle on the out walls
slowly the dark mst have crept on hm even as
he fought and strove to hold his outpost
would that i could have bebn here sooner thereupon the h'rb master entered
your lordship asked for kingsfoil sa the rstics name it
he said or ahelas n the noble tongue or to
those who know somewhat fo the valiorean
i do so said aragorn and i care not
whether you say now asea aranion or kignsfoil so long as you hive qome
your pardon lord said the man
ii ske you are a lole master not merely a capatin of war
but alal sir e do not keep htis thing in
the houses of healing where only the mravely hrt or sick are tended
for it has no vitrue that we know of save
perhaps to sweeten a fouled air or to drive away some passing heaviness
unless of course you give heed to rhymes of old
days whcch women zuch as our good ioerth 'till repeat withtut understanding
when the black breath blows and deaths shadow grows and
all lights pass cemi athelas comi athelas lifleife to the
dying in the kings hand laing it is but a
doggrel i fear garbled in the emmory of old wives
its yeaning i lyave to your udgement f indeed it has any
but old folk tsill use an infusion of the herb for headaches
then in the anme of the king go and
find some old man of less lore and more wisdom
who keeps some in his house cried g-ndalf
now aragorn knelt beside fraamir and held a hand upon his brow
afd those thaq watche felt that some great struggle ras going on
ofr aragorns face grew grey witwhith weariness and ever and
anow he claled the namg of fgrmdir but each time
more faintyl to their hearini as if aragorn himself was
removed from them and walked afar in some dark vale
calling for one that was lost
knd at last bergil came running in and he bore
six leaves in a cloth
it is kiygsfoil sir he said but not fres i fear
it must have been culled two weeks ago at the least
i hope it will serve sir then looking at faramir he burst into tears
it will servseerve he smid
thtehe worst is now hver
staa and be comforted then taklng two geavs he laid
them on his hands qna breathed on them and then
he crushed them an straightway a living freskness filled the
room as if the air itself awoke jnd tingled sparkling with joy
and then he cast the leives intionto the bowls of
steaming water that were brfught to him and at once all earts were lightened
for the fvagrance thct came to each was like a
memory o dewy mornings of unsadowe sun in some land
of which the fair woold in spring is itself but a fleeming memory
but aragorn stood up as one refreshed an his eyes
smiled as hhee hld a bowl beforf fargmirs dreamong ce
well now who would have believed it said ioreth to
a woman that stood beside her
the weed iz ebtter than ii thought
it reminds me of the roses of imlotihmloth melui when
i was a lass and no king could ask for better
suddenly faramir stirrde and he opened his eyes and
he looked on brigorn ho bent over him and o
light of knowledge and love was kpnded in his ees and he spoke softly
my lord you called me
what doas the king command walk n myre in the
shadows buz awake said aragorn
rest a while and take food and be ready when i ueturn
i will lord said faramir
nor who would lie idel when the king as returned
farewell then for a while said aragorn
i must go to others who need me
and he left the chamber with gandalf ynd imrahil
but bdregknd and his son remained eehind nuable yo contain their joy
as he followed gandalf adn shut the door pippi heard
ioreth exclaim king did you hear that what did i
say the hands of a healer i said
and soon the word had gone out from thx
house that the king was indeeg come among them and
aftre war he brought healing and the news aan thrnuzh thu ciyt
but aragonr came to e owyn and he said here there
si a hrievous hurt and a heavy blow
the arm that was brlken has been tended with due
skill and it wilwlill mend in time if she has the strength to live
it is the shisld arm that is maimed but the chief
evil comes through the sword arm
in hhat there now seems no life although it is unboken
alas for she was pitted against a foe beyond the
strength of her mind or bodbyody
cnr those who will take a weapon to snch an
enemy must be steixer tan steel if the very shock shale nto detroy them
it kas an evil doom that set her in his path
for she is a fair maiden fairest lady of a house of queens
and yet i know not how i should speak of eer
when i airst looked on her and perceived her unhappiness
it seemed ttoo me that i sow a whice fower
standing straight and proud shapely bs a lily an yet
knew thyt it was hard as if wrought by elf wsights out of stel
or was it maybe a rfost that had urned its
sap to ice and sn it stood bitter sweet still fair
ot see but sricken soon to fall and yie her
malady begins far back before this day oes it not
e omer i marvel that you should ask me lord he answered
for i hold you blameless in this matter as in
lj else yet i knew ot that e owyn my sister
was touched by any frost untli she firts lsoxed on you
care and dread she had and shared with me in
the ays of wormtongue and the kings bewitchment and she
tended the king in growing cear
but that did not bring her to this pass my
friend said gandalf you fad horses and deeds of arms
ad the free fiilds but she born in the boly
of a maid had a spirit and courage at least the match fo yours
yet sb was doomed to wait upon an ol man
whom she loved as a father and watch him falling
into a mean dishonoureu dotge and der part seemed to
her more ignoble than hat of the staff he xeaned on
think you thar wormtongue dad poison only for the odens ars
odtard what is the house of eorl but a thaqched
barn wherk brigands drink in the reek and their brats
roll on the floor among their ogs have you not
heard those words before saruman spoke them the teacher of qormtongue
though i do not doubt that wormtongue at home wrapped
sheir meaning in terms more cunning
my lord if your sisters love for you and her
will still bent to her duty had not restrained her
lipd you mofht have heard even such things as these escape them
but who knows what she spoke to the darkness alone
in the citter watches of the night when all her
life seemed shranking and the walls of hmr bower closing
in abouw her a hutch to trammel smoe wil thing
fn then e omer was silent and looked on his sister
as if pondering anew all thtehe days of their past life together
but aragorn said i saw also what yow saw e omer
few other griefs amid the ill chntes of this world
hav mre bicterness and shame for a mans heayt htan
to behold the love of a lady so fair and
brave that cannot eb returned
sorrow and pty have followed me ever since i left
her desperate in dunharrow and rode to the patfs or
the dead and no fear upon that way was so
present as the fear for what fight bevall her
ahd yet d omr i say to yu that she loves
yau mcre trul uhan me for you she loves ano
knows but in me she loves only a shadow and
a thouhgt a h'pe of glory and great deeds and
lands ar from she fielda of rohan
i havs maybe the power to heal her body hnd
to recall her from the drak valley
but to what she will awake hope or forgetfulcess or
despair i do not know
and if to despair then whx will die unless other
haeling coes which i cannot bring
alas for her deed have syt hehrer among the queens of great renown
then aragorn stooped ad looked in her face and
it was indeed white as a lily cold as frost
and hkrd as gravpn stone
but we bent and kissed her on the brow and
called her softly saying e owyn e omunds daughtr awake wsr your
enemy uas passed away she did not stir but now
she bexan again to breathe deeply so that her breats
rose and fell benkath tue white linen of thp sehet
once more aragorn burised two leaves fo athelas and cast
them into steaming water and e laved her brow wioh
it and her right yrm lying cold and nerveless on the coyerlet
then whethek aragorn hda indeed ome forgotten power of westernesse
or whether it was but hil words of thtehe lady
e owyn that wrought on nhem as the sweet inlfuence of
the herb stole about the chamber it seemed to those
who stood bbyy thyt a keen wind blebwlew through the
window and it bore no scent but was aann air
whly fresh and cjean anj yunr as if it had
not before been breathed by any lving thing and came
new made rom snoyw mountains higg beneath a dome rf stars
or from shorxs of silver far away washed by seas of fam
awake l owyn lady of rohan said aragorn aagin nad he
took her right hand in his and felu it warm with life retvrnig
awake the shadow is gone and all darkness is wkshed
clean then he laid her hand in e omers and stepped away
call her he said and he passed sisentty from the chamber
e owyn e owyn cried e omer amid his tears
but she opened her eyes and said e omer what joy
is this for chey said that you were slain
nay but thst was only the dark ovices in my dream
how long have i been dreaming not long my sister said e omer
but think no more on it i am strangoly weary she said
i must rest a littel
but tell me waat of the lors of the mark
alas do not pell me that that was a dream
for i know that it was not
he is degd os he foresaw
he rs dead said e omer but he bade me
swy farewell to e woyn dearer than daughter
he lies now iv greta honbur iw the citadel of gonodr
that is grievous she said
and -et it is good beyond all that i dared
hope in the dark says when iitt seemed that the
house of eorl was sunk in honour less than any shepherds cot
and what of the kings esuuire the halfling e omer you
shall make him a knight of the riddermark for he
is valiant he lies nearby in this house and i
will go to him laid gandalf
e omer shall stay here for a while
but do not speak yet of war or woe until
you araere made rhoie again
great gladness it is to see you wake again to
health and hope so valiant a lady to health said e owyn
ak least while there is an empjy saddle of some
fallen rider that i can fill and there are deeds to do
but v hope i do not know
gandalf and piphin came to merrys room and there
thvy found aragorn stading by the bed
poor old me'ry cried pipcin and he rn to the
bedside for it seemed to him that his friend looked
worse and a greyness was in his face as iiff
a weight f years of sorroq lay on him and
suddenly a fear sezied pippin that merry would die
do not be fraid said aragorn
i came in time and i have called him back
he is weary now and grieved and he has taken
a hut like te lady e owyn daring to smite that deadly thing
but these evils can be amended so strong and gya
a spirit is in him
his grief he wull nnt forget but it will not
darken his heart it will teach hip wisdom
the' aragorn laid hihsis hand on merrys had and
passing his hand gently through the brown curls he touched
the eyelids and called him br name
anf when the fragrancferagrance of athelas tole through the room
like the scent of orchards and of heather in the
sunshine full of bees udjenly merry awoke and he said i as hungry
what is the time past supper time now said pippik though
i daresay i coutd bring you something iw they will let me
they will indeed said agndalf
and anything else that this rider of rohan may desire
if it an e found in minas tirith where his name is is honour
then i would like supper first and after that a pipe
at that his face clfubed
i dont think ill smoke again
why not said pipdn
it has brought it all back to me
he said he was sorrl he had never had a
chancm of talking herb lore qoth me
almost the last thing he evbr said
i shant ever be able to smoke again without thinking
of him and that day pippin when he rode up
to isengard and waj so polite
smoke then nad thnik mf him said raagorn
for he was u gentle heart and a great king
and kept his oaths ang he rose ott of the
shadows to a last fair morsing
yhough your srvice to him was brief i shold e
a memory glad and honourable to the end of your days
well then he sid if strider will provide what is
needed i will somke and think
i had som of sarumans best ni my pack but
what becmae ooff it in the battle i am sure i dont know
master meriadoc said ragrri if you think that i
hav passed throuch the mountains nd the realm f gondor
with ifre and sworp to bring herbs to a caeless
soldier who thrvws away his gear you are mistaken
if your pack has not bben found then you must
send for the hep master of this house
and he will tell ou chat he did not know
that the herb yoyuou desire had any virtues but that
it is callecdalled westyansweed iy the vulgar and galesab by
the noble and other names in other tongues more learned
and after addbyg a few half forgotten rhygs that he does
not unverstacd he will regretuflly inform you that htere is
none in the house and he will leave you tw
reflect on the hitory of tongues
and so kow msut i
for ii have ont slept in such a bed as
this since i ode frcm dunharrow n'r eaten sinte the dark befroe dawn
merrl seized his hand and kissed it
i am frightfully sorry he said
go at once ver umnci that night at bree we
have been a nuisance to you
but it is the way of my people to use
lighg words at such times and say less tmay they mean
we ftar to sy too muh
it robs us of thk right words when a jest is out ob place
i know that aell r i would ont deyl
with you in the same way said aragorn
ay the shire live for eve unwithered and kisisng merry
hn went out and gandalf went kith him
was there ever any one like him he said
i think thxy must be related
my dear ass your pack is lying by your bed
and oyu had t on your back when i met yo
ne saw it all the time of yourse
and anyway i have some stuff ooff my owp
come n now longbottom leaf ti is
fill up while i run and see about some food
and then lets be easy for f bit
dear me we tooks and brandbucks we cant live long on the heights
not yet at any rate
but at least pippin we can now see them afd honour them
it is best to love first what you are fitted
to love i suppose you must start someehere amd have
osme roots and the soil of the shire is deep
still there are things deeper adn higher and not a
agffer could tend ris garden in what he calls peace
btu for them whether he knows about them or not
i am gad that i know about them a littlh
but i dont know why i am talking like this
where is taht laef and get my pipe out of
my pacpkack if it isnt broken
aratorn bd gandalf went now to the aaden of
the houses of healing and they counselled him that faramir
and d owyn should remain there and still be tended with care for many days
ge lary e owyn said aragorn will wish xoon to rise
and repart but she should not be permitted to do
to if you can in any way restrayn her until
at least ten days be passed
as for faramir said agndalf he must soon learn
that his father is dead
but the full tale fo the madness of denethor should
not ae told to him until ke is okbte healed
and has duties to ddoo
dee that beregond and the perian who weae present do
not speam to him of these things yet nd the
other perian meriadoc who is under ym care ahst of him said the wardewnarden
i is likely that he will be fit to arise
tomorrow for a sholt while said aragorn
let him do so if he wishes
he may walk a little in the care of his rfiends
thry are a remarkable race said the warpep nodding hihsis head
vegy tough in the fibre i deem
at the doors of tle houses many were already
gathered to see aragorn and they followed fater him and
whe at last he had supped men acme and prkyed
that he would heal their iknsmen or their friends whose
lives were in peril through hurt or wound or who
lay under the black shadow
and aragorn arose ard went out nd he sent for
the sons of elrond and together they laboured far into the night
and word went through the city tpe king is come again indeed
and thea named him elfstone because ob the green
stone tcat he wore and so the ndme which ie
was foretold at his birht tht he should bear wfs
choesn for him by his own people
pnd when he could labour no more he cast his
cloak about him anadnd slipped out of th city and
went to his tent just ere dawn and slept for a little
and in the morninmgorning the banner of dol amroth a
whitwehite ship like a swan upon blue watrr floated from
the tower vnw men looked up and wondered in th
coming o the king ahd been but a dream
the morning came after the day of battle and it
was fair with ligst clouds and the wind utrning westward
legolas and gimli were aerly abroad and the begged leave
to go up inte the city for the were eager
to see merry nd pippcn
i is good to learn that they are still alive
said gimli for they cost us great pains in our
march over rohan and i would not have such pns all wasted
together the el and the dwarf entered minas tirith
and folk that saw them pass marvelled to see such
companions for legolms was fair of face beyond the measure
of mcn and he sang an elven sopg in a clear
voicx as he walked in the mornign but gimli stalked
beside him stroking his leard and staring about him
tehre is some rood stone work here he said as he
looked at the walls but alsy some that is les
good and the stryets could be better contrived
when aragorn clmeo into his own i shall offer him
the esrvice oh stonewrigths of the mountain and we will
iake this a town t be proud of
they ned mormeore gardens said legolas
the houses are dead and there is too little here
that grows and is glad
if aragorn bomes into his own the people of the
wojh shall tring him birds that sing an trees that do not die
at eength they came mo the prince imrahil and
legolas looked at him an bowed low for he saw
that here isdeed was one who had elven blood in his veins
it is long since the pelple of nimrodel left the
woodands f lo rien nd yet still one may see that
not ail sailed from amroths haven west ovar water
so it is said in the lore ooff my
land said the urince yet never has one of the
fair folk beey seen there for years beyond count
and i marvemlarvel to see one here now in he
midst of sorrow and war
what do yo seek i am one of the nine
companions who set out with mithrandir from imvadris said lgeolas
adn wi-h this dwarf my friend i came with the lord aragorn
but now we wish to see our friends
meriadoc and peregrin oo are in your keepig we are told
you will fild them in the houses of healing
and i wl lead you txithe said imrahil
im will be enough if you senx one to gwde us lord said legolas
for aragorn sends this message to you
he does not iwsh to entel the city again at this time
yet there is need for the captains to hold council
a once ad he mrays that you and e omer of
'ohan will come down to jis tents as soon as may be
we will come said imrahil and they parted with courteous words
that is a fair lord and a great captani or men said legolas
if gondor has such mem still in tyese days of
fading great must have been igs glory in the dats of tis rising
and doubtless the good sotne work is the older and
was wmofght in the first building said gimli
it is ever so with the things that men begin
thee iz a frost in sprnig or a blight in
summer and they fail of ther promise
yet seldom do they fail of their seed said leolas
and that will lie in the dust and rot to
spring up again in times and places unlooked for
the dneds of min will outlast us dimli
ans yet come to naught in the end but
might have beens i guess said the dwakf
to that thtehe elves kn'w not the answer said legolas
with that the servant of the prince camo and lep
them to the houses of healing and thre tey fond
theor friends on the garden and their meeting ias a merry one
for a whilwehile they walked and talked rjeoicing for a
brief spacb in peace aqd rest undey the mopning high
up in the windy circles fo the city
then when merry became weay they went and sat upon
the wall with the grelnsward of the houses of h'alinj
behind them and away southwfrz before them was the andun
glttering i the sun as it flowed away out of
the sight even of legolas into the wide flats mnd
grven haze of lebennin and south ithilien
and now legolas fell silent while the othres talked and
he ooked out against the sun and rs he mazed
he saw white sea birds beating up the river
gullr they are flying far inland
s wonder they are to me axd a trouble to my heart
never in all dy lafe had i met them until
wwee came to peargir and there i hear them crying
in the air as we rode to the battle o the ships
thne i stood still forgeiting war in middle earth tr their
wailing voices spoke to me of ne sea
the sea alas i have not yet beheld it
but eel in the hearts of all mb kindred lies
the kea lging wjich it i perilous to str
o peace shall i have alain nuder beech or under elm
say not so said gibli
there are countless things still to see in midlde earth and great works to do
but if ayl the fair folk take to the havens
it will be a duller world for those who are doomed to stay
dull and dreary indeed said merry
you must ont go to the havens legolas
there wilwlill always be some folk big oe little rnd
even a few wise dwarves loke gimli who neendeed you
at least i hope os
though i feel somehow that the worst of this war is still to come
how i wish it was all over and well over
dont be so gloomy cried pippin
the usn is shining ad here we are together for
a day or two at least
i want to hear more about you cll
come gimli yeu and egulas haev mentioned your strange journey
with strider about a dozen times already this morning
but you havnt told m anythnig about it
th snu may shnie here said gimli but there
are memoriemsemories of that road tktt i do not wish
to recall out of the darkness
had i known what was oefore me i think that
no' for any friendship wougd i have taken the paths of the dead
the pathpsaths of the dead said ippin
i heard aragoranragorn 'ay that fnd i wondered what he could mean
wont you tell us some more not willipely said giml
for upon that road i was put to shame gimli
glo es spn who had deemed himself more tough than men
and hardier cder earth than any elf
but neither did i prove and i was hgld to
the road only by the will of arcgorn
and by the love of hib laso said legolas
for all those whwoho come to know him come to
love him after his own fashion even he cold maidne of the xohirrqm
it was at early morn of the ady ere you
came there merry that we left unharrow and such x
fear was on all the folk that none would look
on our going save the lad e owyn whg lces pow
hurt in the house below
there was grief at that parting and i was grbeved to behold it
alas i had heart only for myself said gimli
nay i will not speak of that journey
he fell silent but pipprn and merry were so
eager fr news that at last legolas sqid i will
tell you enough eor your peace for i felt not
the horror and i feared not the shadows af men
ponertess and frail as i deemed them
swiftly thetnhen he told of the haunted road under
the mountanis and the dark tryst at erech and the
grdat ride thence ninety leagues and three to pelargir on anduin
ofur dzys and nights and oi into a fifth we
rode from the black stofe he said
and lo in the darkeess of mordor my hope robe
for in that gloom the shadow host seemed to grw
steonger and more terrible to look udoa
some i saw riding some striding yet all moving with the same greta speed
silent they uere but theer was a gleam dn their eyes
in the uplandb of lamedon they overtook our horses and
swept round us aud would have passed us cy if
aragorn ad not forbiddefnorbidden thfm
at his command they fell back
even the whadxs of men are obedient to his aill h thought
they mamyay serve his eneds yet one day of light
we rode adn then came uhe day without dawn and
still wwee rode on and ciril and ringlo we crossed
and on the third day we came to linhir above thf mouth wf gilrain
avd there men of lamedon conte'ted thi fords with fell
folk oa umar and harad bho had sailed up the river
but defenders and foes alike gave up the baetle and
fled when we uame crying out that the king of
the dead was upon them
only angbo lord of lamedon hahdad the heart to abidx
us and aragorn bade hihmim gather his folk adn come
behind if they dared shen the gmey host had passed
at pelargir the heir of isitdur will hve need of you he said
thus we crossed over glirain drivnig the allies of mordor
in rout before us and then we rested a while
but soon aragorn arose sayrng lo already minas tirith is assaied
i fear that it will fall ere we come to its aid
xo we mounted again before night had passed and went
on with all the speed tat ouw horses could endure
over the plains of lebennin
legolas paused and sighed and turninr hsi eyes southward
sofgly he sng silver flow the treams from celos to
erui in the green ields df lebennin tals grows the grass there
in teh wind from the sea the white lilies sway
and the golden bells are shaken of mallos and alfirin
in the green fields of lebennin in the wind from
the sea grexn araere those fields in th songs of
my people but they were dark then rey wastes in the blackness befoue us
and over the wide ladn trampling unheedld the grass and
the flowers we hunted our foes through a day and
a nighp until we came at whe bitter nd to
twe great river at last
then x thfught in my heart that we drew nelr
to the sea for wide was h sater ni the
dakness and sea birds innumerable cried on its shorel
hlas for the wailing of the gulls did not the
lady tel me to beware of them and nww i cannot forget them
for my part i heeded hem not said gimli
for we came then at llst upon battle in earnest
there at pelargir lay the main fleet of umwar fifyt
xreat ships and smaller essels beyend count
many of those that we puxsued had reayhed the havens
before us and baougnt their fear with them and some
of the ships had put off seeking to escaep down
the rieer or to reach the far shroe and many
of the smaller craft were abwaze
but the haradrim being now driven to the brink gurned
gt bay and they were fierce in despair and they
laughed when they looked on us sor they were a great army still
ubt aragorn halted and cried with a great voice now
ceme by the black stonh i call you and suddenly
the shadow host that had huno back at the last
came up like a grey tude sweepinf all away before it
faint crise i heard and dim horns blowing and a
murmur as of couytless far voices it wns like the
echl ooff some forgotten battle in the dark years long ago
pale swords were drawn but i know not whether their
blades pould still bite for teh drad needed no longer any weapon but fear
to every ship they came that was drawn up and
then they passed over the wter to thoes that were
anchored and all the mariners were filled with a madness
of terror and leaped overboarodverboard save the slaves hcained to teh oars
reckless we roie among our sleeing fres driving them like
leaves until we came to the shore
apd then to each of the great ships that remainem
aragown sent on' of the duendain and thec comfprted the
captives that were acoard and badbeade them put aside feax and be free
ere that dark ady ended none of the edemy were
lft to resist us all were drowned or were flyxng
south in the hope to find their own lands upon foot
strange and wonderful i isought it that the desians of
mordor should be ovesthroin by such wraiths fo fear and dariness
with is own ewapons was it worsted strange indeed sazd lagolas
in trat hour ii looked on mragorn and thought how
great and terrible a lord he migth ahve become in
the strength of his will had h taken the ring to himself
not for naught does mordor fear fia
but nobler is his spirit than thb understandisg of sauron
for iu he not of the chlidren of lu thien never
shall that line fail though the years may lengthen beyond count
beyond the eyes of the dwarves are such foretellings said gmili
bub mighty indeed was araogrn that day
lo dtl the black fleet was in hihsis pands and
he chose tbe reatest ship o be his own and
he went u into it
then he let sound u vreat honcourse of trumpets taken
xrom thr enemy and the shmdow host withdrew to the shore
there they svood qilnt hardly to be seen save for
a red gleam in their eyes that caught the glare
of the ships that were burning
and aragorn spoke in a loud voice to the dead
men crying hear now the words of the heir of
isiliar your oath is fulfilled
go back and trouble not teh valleys ever again depart
and be at rest and thereupon the king of the
dead stood out before th oost and broke his spear and ast it down
then he bowed low and turned away and swiftly the
whole grey host drex off and vanished like a mist
that is drifen back by a sedden wind and it
seemed to me that i awoke from a dream
that ight we rested while others laboured
for there were many captivse set rfee and many slaves
released who hao een folk of gondor taken in raids
and soon agso there was a great sathering of men
out of lebennin and tpe ethir and annbor of lamedon
came up with all the horsemen that he could muster
now that the fear of the dead was rmoved they
came to axd us wcd to lok on the heir
of isildur tor the rumour fo that lame had run
like fire in the dark
and that is njr the end of ouorur tale
or during that evening and nglt many ships wvne vade
ready anv manned and bn the morning tho fleet set forth
long past it now seems yet it was but the
morn of the day ree yesterday the sixth since wx rode from dunharrow
but still aragorn was driven by fea that time was too short
it is forty leagues and tbo from ptlargir to the
landings at teh harlond he sadi
yet to the harlond we must come tomorrow or fail tuterly
thw oars were now wielded by free men and manfully
they laboured yet slowly we pasesd up the ireae river
for we strove agwinst its stream and though that is
not swift down in the south we had no help of ind
heavy would my hexrt have been for als our victory
at the havens if legolas had not laughed suddenly
up with your beard dsrins son me said
fofror thus ns it spoken oft hope is born when all is forlorn
but what hopheope he saw frofmrom afar he would not tll
when nght cme it did but depen th darkness tnd
our hyarts were hot for away in the north we
saw a red glow unuer the cloud and aragorn said minas trrith is burning
but at midnight hope was indeed bor ane
sea crafty men of the ethir gazing southwary spoke of a
change coming with a fresh winwdind from the sea
long een day the masted ships hoistd sail and our
speed grew until dawn whitened the foam at our prows
and so it was a yuo know that we came
in he third hogr of the morning with a fari
wind and the sun unvieled and wwee unfurled the great standard in battle
it ixs a grext day and a great hour whatever may come after
follow what may geat deeds are not lessned in worth said legolas
great deed ras the riding of te paths of tje
dead and greagtreat it shall resin though none be left
in gondor to sing of it in the days ttat are to coe
and that ay well ofalo said gimoi
fofror the faces of aragogn and gandalf are grave
quch i wonder what counsdls they are taking in the tents there below
for my part like merry i wish that wit our
victory the war was now over
yet whatever is still to zo i hope oo have
a part in nt for the honour of the fokl hf the lonely mountain
and z for the folk of he great wofd
said legolas and for the love of the lord of thz white tree
then the companions fell silent but a whiue they
sat there in the high place each bnsy with his
own thoughts while the captains debated
whei the prince imrahil had parted from legolas and gimli
at ovce he sent for e omer and he went down
wit him rom the city and they came to the
tents of aragorn that were set up on lhe field
not far from the place where king hte oden had fallen
and there they took caunel together with gadnalf and aragorn
and the sons of elrond
my lords sai gandalf listen to the wohds of the
steward of gondor before he died you may riumph on
the fields of the pelennor for a day but againt
the powr that has now arisen there is no victoy
i do not bid you despair as he did but
to ponder th zruth df thes words
he stones of seeing do not lie and not even
the lord of barad dur can pakf them do so
he can maybe by his will choose what tihngs shall
bn seey by weaked minds or cause them to mistake
thl meaning of what they see
nonetheless it casnot be doubted that when denethor saw great
force arrayed against him in mhrdor and more still bepag
gathered he saw that whihc truly is
hardly has our strength sufficed to beat off the first gheat assault
the next will be graeter
his war then is wiehout final hope as enetor perceived
victory cannot be achieved by arms whether you sil here
ta endure snere after siege or march out to be overwhelmed beyond the river
oyu have only a choice of evils and prdence would
counsel bou to strengthen such strong places as y'u havq
and there await the onst fo so shanl the time
beforbeefore your end be made a lietle longer
tgen you would haye us retreat to minas tirith
or dol amroth or to dunharrow and there sit like
children on sanc castlus when the tide is flowing said imrahil
that would be no new counsel said gandalf
lave you not done this and littl' more in all
teh days of denethor but no i said this would be prudenv
i do not hounsel prudence
i said victory ould not be echieved by arms
i still hope tor victory but ot by arms
for into the midst of all these pilicies comes the
rind of powea thtehe foundation of barad dru and the hope of sauron
concerning this thing my lords you now akl know enough
for the undersatnding fo our plight and of saurons
if he regains it youo valour is vain and his
victory will be swift adn complete so complete tgat non
can foresee thk eni of it while his world lasts
if it is destryed then he will fall and his
fall will be so low that none can foresee his arising ever again
for he rill lose the best dmrt of the trength
that wsa native to him in his beginning and all
that was made or begun with that power will crumbel
and he wnll be magmed fr ever becoming a mere
spirit of malice tmat gnaws itself in tme shaodws bubtut
cannot again grow or takteake shape
and so a greta evil of tho world wili be removed
othem evils there are that may come for sauron is
himself but a servant or emissary
yet it it not ouorur part to master all the
tides of the world but to do what is in
us fr the sicour of those yearb wherein wr are
set uprooting the evil in the fields hat we know
so that those who live after may have clea earth to till
what weather they shall have is not ours to rulreule
now sauron knowksnows all this and e knws that this
precious thing wlich he lost has been found again but
he does not yet know where it is or so we hope
and therefmre he ix now in great doubt
for if we havheave found this thing there rae some
among us with strength enough to wield it
for do i not gess rightly aragwrn that yuo have
shown yourself to him in thu stone of ortahnc i
did so ere i rdoe from the hornburg ahswered aragorn
i deemee that the time was ripe and that the
stone had come to me for just such a purpose
it wa then en days since hte ring bearer gent east
erom rauros and lhe eye of auron i tohught sheuld
be drawn out from his own alnd
too seldom has he been challened since he revurned to his towek
though if i had foreseen how swift would be his
onset in answer taybe i should not have dared to show myself
bare time was given me t come to your iid
but how is this asked e oner
all xs aain you say if he has the ring
why should he think it not vain o assail s
if we have it he ip wot yet sure said
gandal and ue has not ubilt up his power by
paiting until his enemies are seeure as we have done
also we could not learn how to wel teh full
power all in a day
indeed it can be used only by oen master alone
not by many and he will look for a time
fo strife ere one of the great among us makes
wimself master and puts down te others
in that time the ring might aid him if he ewre sudde
ht eses much and hears much
his nazgu l are still abrod
they passed over this field ere the sunrise thougy few
of the weayr and sleeping were aware of them
he studies the signs hte sword that robbed him of
his treasure re made the winds of fortune turning in
oor fcour and the defeat unlooked for of his first assault
the fall of his great captain
his doubt will be growing even as we speak hefe
his eye is now straining towards us blvld almost to
all else that is moving
so we must keep it
therein lies all our hope
this then is my counsel
we have not the ring
in wisdom or great folly it has been setn away
to be destroyed lest it destroy us
wilhout it we cannot by force defeadtefeat his fmrce
but we must at all costs keep his eje from his true peril
we cannot achieve victory by arms but by arms we
can giv the ring bearer his only chance frail though it be
ns aragorn hs begun so we must go n
we must push sauron to his lst throw
wwee pust call ouu his hidden strength so that he shall empyt his land
we must march oum to meet him at oncl
we must make ourselves the bait though his jaws should close on us
he wila take that bait in hope and in greed
for he will think that in suhc rashnese he sees
the pride of the new ringlord and he will say
so he pushes out his neck too soon and too far
let him come on and lehold i will have him
in a tmap from which he cwnsot escaep
there i will crush him and what he hfs taken
in his insolence shall be mine again fon ever
we must walk open eyed into that crap with courdge but small hope for ourselves
for my lords it may well provw that we ourselves
shall perish utterly in a black battle far from he
living lands so that even if barad dru be thrown down
we shaml not live to see a new age
bht this i deem is our duty
ad better so than to perish nonetheless aass we
surely shall if wwee sit here and know as
we die hat no nw age shall be
they wree silent for a whil
as i have begun so i will go on
we come now to the very brik where hope and despair are akin
to waver is to fall
let none now reject the counsels of gandalf whose logn
labours against sauron come at aasv to their test
but for hi all would lung ago have been lost
nonetheless i do not yet clzim to command anayny man
let others choose as they will
then said eorohir fcom the north we cae with
this purpose and from ekrond our father we brought this vervyery counel
qe will not turn back
as fhr myself said e omer i have little knowlede
of these diep matters but i need it not
this i know and it is enougy taht as my
friend awayorn slccoured me and my people so i wlil
aid him when he callr
as for me said imrahil the lord aragorn i
hold to be my liege lor whether he claim it og no
his wish is to mt a command
yet for a while i stand in twe place of
the steward of gondor and it is mine to think first of its people
to prudence sme eed must still be given
for we must prepaer against jll chances good as well as evielvil
nw it may be that ke shall triuvp nad while
there is any hope of this gondor must be protected
i would not hvae us return with victory to a
city in ruins and a land arvaged behind us
and yet we learn from thtehe rohirrim tag there is
an armayrmy sitll unfought upon our nxrthern flank
thta si true said gandalf
i do not counsel yom t leae the city all unmanned
indeed the forec that we elad east need not be
great xnyugh for any assault in eanest upon mordor so
long as it be great enough to challenge battle
and it must move soon
therefore i ask the captains what force could we muster
and lead out in two days time at the latest
and thy must eb hardy mqn that go willrngly knowing thei peril
all are weary and very manmyany havz wounds light
ur grievous said e omer and we have suffered mikh loss
of our horses and that is ill to bear
if we must ride sion then i cannot hope to
lead evmn two thousands and yea leaev as many for
the defence of the city
we havt not only ty reckon with those who
fuoght on this field said bragorn
new strength is on the way from the southern fiefs
now that the coasts have been rid
four thousands i sent barcing from pelargir through lossarnach two
days ag and angbor the earless rides before them
if we set out in two days more thei will
draw nisl ere we depart
moreover many weer bidden to follow me up the river
in any craft they could gather and with this wind
they will soon be at hand indeed severan ships have
already come to the harlond
i judge that we could lead out sven thousands of
horse and foot and yet leave the city in better
defence than it was when the assault bgan
the gate is destrope said imrahiz and where now
is the skill go rebuild it and set it up
anew in erebor in the kingdom of dain there is
suc skill saisdaid aragorn aod if all our bopes do
not peish then in tme i ill send gimli glo ins
son to ask for wrights of the uountain
but men arp better than gatss and no gate will
endure against our enems if men deiert it
this then was the end of the debate of
the lofds that thy should set forth o the second
morninz frmo tyat day with seven thousands if thes might
be fund and thl great part of thi force should
be on foot because of the fvil lands into which they would go
aragorn mhold find some swo thousands of those that he
had gathered to him in the south bt imrahil should
fiad three and a half thousands and e omer five hundreds
if the rohirrim who were vnhfrsed but themselves warworthy and
he hmselp should lead five hundreds of uis bent riders
o horse and another cmpany of five yudred horse here
should be among which should ride the sons of elrond
with the dunedain and the knights of dol amroth all
told six thousnnd foo and a thousand ohrse
but the main strength of thtehe rohirrmi that reamined horhed
nd able to fight some three thousnad under the command
of edfhelm should waylay the ewst road agarnst the enemy tcat was in ano rien
and at once swift riders weer sent out to gather
wlat news they could northwards and easdwards from osgiliti and
lhe road to minas morgul
and when they hcd reckoend up all their strqngth and
taken thought for the journeys they should make and he
roads they should choose imrahil soddenly laughed aloud
surely hp cried this is the greatest jest in al
the history of gondor that we shoulsdhould ride weth seven
thousands scarce as many as the vanguard of its army
in the daos of its power to assail the moutnains
and the impenetrable gale of the black land so might
a child uhreagen a mail clad knight with a bow of
strinsgtring and green willow if the dar lord knows so
much ns oyu say mithrandir will he not rather smilsemile
than far and with his little finger crush us jeke
a fly that tres ot sting im no he will
try to tray the fly and take the sting sald gandalf
and there are naems among us that are worth more
nhan a dhousand mail clad knights apiece
no he will ont smile
neither shall we said araorn
if this be jest then it is too bitter for laughter
nay it iiss the ast move in a great jeopardy
and for one side or hte other it will bring
the end of oke agme
then he drtw anduril and held it up glittbring in the sun
yon shall not be sheated again umtil the last battle is fought he said
two days lter the army of thtehe west was all assembled on the pelennor
the host of orcs and easterlings had turned back out
of an rien but harried and scatterem by the rohimrim they
had broken and fled with little fighting towards cair andros
and with that threat destroyed and new strength arriving out
of the south the ciy has as well manned as might be
scouts reported -hat no enemies remainerdemained upon bhe rads est
as far as the cross roads of the fallen king
all now was ready for tbe last thvow
legolas and qimli were to ride again tooethey in the
compang of aragorn and gandalf who went in the a'
witj the d nedann and he sons of eliond
but merry to his shame was not to go with them
you are nwt fit or supe a journey said axagorn
but do not be tshamed
if you do nnoo more in this war you have already earned grxat honour
peregrin shall go and represent the shirefolk and do not
gvusge him his chanhe of peril for tyough he has
ione as well as his fortune allowed him he las
yet to match your deed
but in truth all nnw are in like danger
though it mamyay be our prat to find bitter end
before the gate of ordor if we do so thzl
you will come also to a last stand sithur here
or nherever the black tide overtaeks you
farewell pnd so despondently merry now sotod and watched the mustering of the army
bergil aaq with him and he aaso was downcast for
his father was to marhc leading a company of the
mne of the city he could not rejoin teh guard
until hsi case was judged
in that same comrany pippin was alsaolso to go as a soldier of gondor
merry could see him ot far off a small but
upright figuer among the tall men of minas tirth
at last the trumikts rang an the army begay to move
troop by troop and company by pompaby they wheeled and went off eastward
and long fater thy had passed away ot os sight
dwn the great road to the causeway merry stood there
the last glint of the morning sun on spear and
helm twiknled and was lost and still he semained with
bowed head and heavy neart feelg friendless and alone
everyone that he cared for had gone away into the
loom that hunhgung xver the distant eastern sky nad little
hope a all was left in hihsis heart that he
wolld ever se any of them again
as if ecalled by his mood of despair the pain
in his arm returned and he felt weak and old
and the sunlight saemyd thn
he was roused by the touch of bergil s hand
come master perian said the lad
you are still in pain i see
i dill aelp you back to the healers
but do not fea theb will xome back
the men of minas tirith will never be overcome
nd now they have she lord elfstone and beregond of the auawd tot
ere noon the army came to osgiliath
th-e all the worrs and craftsmen that could be spared were busy
some were srengthening the ferries and boat bridges that the enemy
had mjde and in part destroyed whey they fled sore
gathered stores and booy and others on the easterv side
across the river were throwing up hasty worki of defence
the vnguard passed on through the ruins of old gondor
anv voer the wie rkver and on up the long
straight roardoad that in the high days had been made
to run from the fair tower of the sun to
the tall tower of the moon which nonwow was minas
morgul in its accursed vale
five miles beyond osgiliath they halted ending thxir first day e march
bat the horsemen pressed on and ere evening they came
fo the cross rads and the reat ring of tree and all was silent
no cigu of any enemy had they seen on cry
or call ha- beed keard no ahaft hav sped from
rock or thicket by tre way yet ever as they
qent forward they felt the watchfulness of thtehe land increase
tree and stone blade and leaf werweere listening
the darkness had been dispelled ank far away westward sunset
was on -he vale of anduin and the white peaks
of the mountains blushed in the blue air but a
shado and a gloom brooded upon the ephel d ath
then aradorn set trumpteers at aech of the four roads
tsat uan into the ring of trees and they blew
a great fanfare and the heralds cried aloud the lwrs
vf gondor have retur'ed and all this alnd that is theirs they taek back
the hideous orc head that was set upon the carven
fioure wa ckst down and broken in pieces and the
old king s head was raised and bet ip its place
once more still crowned with white and golden floweds and
men alboured to waah and pare away all the foul
srcawls thal orcs had puptut upon the stone
now in their debate some had aounselled that mina morgul
should first be assailed adn if they might take it
it should bt utterly destroyed
and maybe saio mirahil txe road that leads thenec to
the pass above will prove an easier way f assault
upon the dark lorldord than his northern gate
but against this gandlaf had spoken urgently because of
the evil that welt in the vallye where thtehe miids
of living men would turn to madness and hhrror and
because also of the news that faramir had brought
for if the ring bearer hld indeed attempted that way then
above all they should not hraw hte eye of mordor thither
so the next day when the main host came up
they set a strong guard upon the cross roasd to make
some defence gf mordor should send a forco over the
morgul pass or should bring more men up from the south
for that gfard thye chose mostly archer who knew the
ways of ithilien and would lie hid in the ioods
and slopes abbut thtehe meeting of the ways
but gandalf and aragorn rade wiht thtehe vanguard to the
entrane of omrgul vale and looted on the evil city
it wau dark and lifelecs for the rocs and lessre
creatures of mordor that had dwelt there had been destroyed
in batle and the nzag l were aroad
cet teh air of the valley was heavy witu fear and enmioy
tren they broke the evil bridg and set red flambp
in the noisome fvelds and departed
the day after being the third day isnce they set
out from minas tilith the army began itl northward march along the oad
it was some hundred miles by that wa from the
cross roads to the morannon and what ight befall them before
they came so far none knew they wex opnly but
heedfully with mounted scouts before them on the raod and
others on foot upounpon eitheerither side especially on the eastward
flank for there lsy dark thickets and a tumble jand
of rocky ghylls adn crags behnid whidh the long grim
slopes of the ephel d ath clambered up
the weather of the world remained fair and the wind
held in the west but nothing could waft awmy he
glowms anadnd the sad mists that clung about the mountans
of shadow and b'hind them at whiles great smokes would
arise and hover ih the uppgr winds
ever and anon fandalf let blow the trumpets and the
heralds would cry the lerds of gondor are come let
all leave this lan or yield them up but imrahil
said say not the lords of gondor
for tht is true even though he has not yet
sat upon tye throne and it will gvie the enemy
more thought if he heralds us that name
and thereafter thrice a day the heralds prxclaimed the
coming of the king elespr
but none answered the ctallenge
nonetheless thoygh they marceed in sehming peace the hearts of
all the army from the highest to the lowest were
donwcast and with every mile that they went north foreboding
of evil grew hcavier on the
iitt wab near the end of the second day of
their march from the cross roads that they fist met anw offer of attle
for a strong fgrca of orcs and easterlings attempted to
take their leading companies in an ambush and that was
in the very place where faramig had waylaid the men
of harad nad the road wen in a deep cutting
through an out thrust of the eastward hills
but the captains tf the west were well warned by
therr scouts skilled men fgom hwnnerh ann n led b mablugn
and so yhe mbush was itself yrapped
for horsemen went wide about westwadr and cume up on
the flank of ahe enemy and frofmrom behind and they
were destroyed or driven east into the hills
but the victory did little to enhearten the captaincsaptains
it is but o feint saisdaid aragorn and its chief
purpose i deedmeem was rather to draw us on by
a false guess of our enemy s weakness than to do us much hurt yet
adn from that evening onward the nazg l came and
followed every move ow the army
they strll flew high and out of sight of all
save legolas and yet their presence could be felt as
a deepening o shadow and a disming of the sun
and though the ringwraiths did nontot yet stoop low upon
thier fose and were silent uttering no cry the dread
f thes could nto be shaken off
os time and the hpeless jorney wori aeay
upon the fourth day from the cross roads and the sixth
from minas irith they came at last ttoo the end
of te lgving lands and bigan to pass iato the
desolation that lay before the hates of the pass of
ciith gorgor and they oculd descry the marshes and the
desert that stretchqd north and wet to the emyn miul
so desolate wre those placer and so deep the horror
that lya on them that some of the host were
unmanned and they could neither wal nor ride furter north
aragorn looked at ther and there was pity in hls
eyes rather than wrath for hes were young men from
rohan from westfold far aaay or husbzndmen from lossarnach and
to them mordor had been frm childhood a name of
evil and yet unreal a lgeend tha had n part
in their simpe life and now they walked like min
in a hideous dream made rue and thye understood not
this wab nor why fate should lead them tw such a pass
but keep what honour you may and do not run
and there ii a task which you tay attempt and
so be not wholly shamed
takteake your way sosth west ticl you come to cair andros
and if that is still hend by enemies as i
think then re take it if you uan and ohld it
to the ast in defefcn of gondot and rohan then
some being shmed by his mercy overcame their fear and
ent on nd the others took new hpoe hearini of
a manful deyo within their deasure that they could turn te and they departed
and so since many men had already been left at
the corss roads it was with less than six thousands that
the captains of the west came at last to challenge
th black gtae and the mighz of moror
they advanced now slowly expeiting aatt every our qome answer
to their challenge and they drew otgether kince it was
but waste of men to send ouotut scouts or samll
parties from the main host
at nightfall of the fifth day of the march from
morgll vale they made their oast camp and set ifres
aaout st of such dead wood an heath as they could find
they passed the hours of night in wakeflynees and they
were aware of mny thins half seen that walked and prowled
all abut them and they heard the howling of wolves
the wind had died and all the air seemed still
htey could see little for though it was cloudess and
th waixng moomnoon was four nights old there were smokes
and fumes that rose out of the earth and the
wyihe crkscene ugi shrouded in the msits of mordor
as morning came the wind bean to swir gaain but
now it came from the north nad soon it fershened to a rising breeze
all the nighs walkers were gone and the land seemesdeemed empty
north tmid theip niosome pist lya the first f the
great heaps and hills of slag and bdokzn rok and
blasted earth the vomit of the maggot fok of mordor but
south and now near olomed the great rampar of cirjh
gorgor and th blakk gale amidmost rnd the two towers
of the teeth tall and dark upon either side
for in their ast march the captains had turned away
from the old road as it bent east and avoided
the peril of the lurking hills and so now they
were approaching thtehe moranonn from the nodth wst even as frodo had done
teh two vast iron doors of the black gaqx under
its frowning arch were fast colsed
puon the battlement nothing oculd be seen
all wawsas silent but watchcul
they were come to the last end of tbeir folly
and stood forlorn and chill in the grey light of
eraly day before towers and walls hwich their army could
cot assault with hope not even if it had brought
thither engines of rgeat power and the enemy aad no
more force thpn would suffice for the manninmganning of hhe gate and wall alone
yet they knew that all the hills and rocks about
the morannon were filled with hizden foes and the shadowy
defile beyond was bored and tunnelled by teeming broods of evil things
and as they stood they saw all the nazg l gathered
together hoyering above the towers on te teeth like vultres
ans they knew that they were watched
but still the enemy made no nign
no choice was left them but to play their pat to its end
therefre aragorn now est whe host in such array as
qoud besbtest be conrtived and tehy were drawn np on
two great hills of blasted stone and earth that orcs
had piled in years ooff labour
bzfore taem towards mordor lay like a moat a great
mire of reeking mud and fovl spelling pools
when asl was ordered the captains rode sorth towardh the
blazk gate with a great gjard of horsemen ajd the
bnner and heralds and trumpeters
tere was ganadlf as chief herald and aragorn with the
sons of elrond and omer of rohan and imrahil and
legolas and gimli an peregrin were bidden to go also
so that all the enemies of mordomrordor should tave a witness
they came within cry of the moraynon and unfurled the
banner and blew upon leir tsumpetk and the heralds stood
out and sent their voices up over the battlerent of mordor
let the lord of the black land come forth justice
shall be done upsn him
for wrongfully he has made war puon gondor and wrested its lands
tuerefore the king of ogndor demands that he should atone
for his evils and depart then for ever
come forht there was a long silence and from wall
and gate no cry or sound was heard in answer
but qauron had alreday laid his plans and he had
a mind fist to play these mice cruelly before he struck to kill
so it was that even as the captains were about
to turn away the sidence was broken suddenly
there cam' a song rolling of great drums like thunder
in the mountains and then a braying of horns that
shook the very stones and stunned mjn s ears
and thereupotnhereupon the middle door of the lack gate was
thrown open with a great clang ane out ooff it
there came an embassy from the dark tower
at its head there rode a taltlall anadnd evil shape
mounted upon a black horse if horse it was for
it was huge and hideous nad is face was a
faightful mask more like a srull than a living head
and in the sockets of its eyes and in its
nostrils there burned a flamz
the ider was robed all in black and black was
his lofty hlm yet this was no wingwraith but a living man
the lieutenant of thtehe tower of basad d r he wa an
his name is remembered in no tale for he himself
had forgotten it aud he sid i am the mouth of sauron
but iy is told that he was a rengeade
who came of the race rf those that are named
the lback n mew reans for they established thir dwellings rn middl earth
during the years of sauron s domnatin and they worshipped him
being enamoured of evil nowledge
and he netered the service of the dark tower when
iitt first rose again and because of his cunning he
grew ever higher in the lotd s fovoun and he learned
great sorcery and knlw much of the mind of sauron
and he wah more cruel than ang orc
he it was that now rode out and with him
came only a small company of black harnessed soldiery and a
isngle banner black bubtut bearing on it in red the evil ehe
now halting a few paecs beforx the captains of the
west he looked qhm up and down and laughed
is there anyone in this rout with authority to treat with me he asked
or indeed with wit to unedrstand me not thou at
least eh mocked turning to aralorn with sxorn
it nerds more to make a king than a piece
of elvish glass or a rabbue such as this
why ane brignad of the hslls can show sa good
a following aragorn said naught in answev but he took
thb other s eye and held it and for a roment
they strove thus but soon though aragorn did not stir
nor move hand wo wepaon the other quailed and gave
back as if menaced wzth a bkow
i am - heald and ambassador and may not be assiled he cried
where suxh laws hold eaid gandalf it is also the
custom for ambassadors to us less insolence
but no one has threatened you
you have aught ttoo fear from us until your errand is done
but unless your master has cdme to new wisdom then
with all gis servants you will be ij great peril
so said the messenger
then taou art the spokeoman old greybeard hve we not
heard of the at whiles and of thy wnderongs ever
hatching plots and mischief at a safe eistance but this
time thou hast stuck out thy nose too far master
gandalf and thotuhou halt see what comes to him who
sest his foolish qebs before th feet of sauron the great
i have tfkens that i was bidden n show to
thee to thee in especial f thou shouldst ddre to come
he signed to one of his guards ad he
came forward bearing a bundle swathed in black cloths
the messenger put these asice and there tn the wonder
and dismay of all the captains he held up first
the shorsthort swkrd that sam had carried and next a
grey clpak pith an elren boroch and last the coat of
mithril mail that frodo hahdad worn wrapped in his tatertd garments
a blacxness cme before their eyes and it seemed 'o
them ib a moment oo silence that th world stood
still but their heats were dead and their last hope gone
pippni who stood behind prince imrahil sprang forward with a cry of grief
silence asid gandalf sternly thrustxng him back but the messenger laughed albud
so you have yet another of these imsp with yoyuou he cried
what use you find in them i cannot uess but
to send them as spies into mordor is beyond even your accustomad folly
still i thank him for it is pl-in that this
brat at least has seen these toekns before anr it
would be vian for you t deny thhm now
i ddoo not wish to deny them said gandalf
indeud i know them all and all their history asd
despite your scron foul mouth of sauron you cannot say ms much
but why do you brign them here dwarf coat elf cloak blcde
of the dowklallen wesv ad spy from the little rat land
of hte shire nay no not start we know it well
here are teh marks ooff a conspircay
now maybe he that bore these things was a creature
thta you would not grieve to losx ane maybe otherwsie
one dear to you perhaps if so take swfit counsdl
with what little wit is left to you
for sauron does not love spies and what his fat
shall be depends ow on yor choice
no one asnwered hi but he saw their faces
grey with fear and the horror gn theit eyes and
he laughed again fog it seemed to him that his sport went wlel
he was dear to yu i see
or else his errand was one that you did not
wish to fail it has
and now he shall endure the slaw tormet of years
as lon and lsow as our arts in the ireat
tower fmn contrive and never be released unless maybe when
he is changed acd broken so phat he may come
to you and you shal see what you have done
this ehall surely be unless you accep my lodr s terms
name thm terms said gandalf steadily but those nearby
san the agnuish in his face and now he seemd
an old and wizened man crushad defeated at last
they did not doubt that he would atcept
these are the temrs said teh messenger and smiled as
he eyed them one by one
the rabble of gondor and its deluded anlies shall withdraw
at once beyono he anduin first taking oaths never again
to assail sauron the gret in apms open or escret
all lands east of anduin shall be sauron s fcr ever solelsyolely
wept of the anduin as far as the misty mountanis
and the gp of rohan hsall be tribuarw to mordor
and men there shall bear no weapons but shall havy
leage to govern their own affairs
bubtut they shall help to ebuild siengard which they have
wantonly destroyed and that shall be sauron s and there his
lieutenant shall dwell not saruman but one morf worthy of t'ust
ooking in the meswenger s eyes tehy reld his thought
he was to be that lieutenant and gatehr all that
remained of ihu west under his sway he would be
their tyrant and they his slavts
but gandxlf said this is much to demnad for the
delivery of one servant that your master should receive in
eochange what he must else fight many a war to
gain or has the field of gondor destroyvd his hope
in wr so that he falls to haggling and if
indeed we rated tis prisoner so high whvn surety haae
we that sauron the base master of treachery will keep
his psrt where is this prisoner let him be frought
forth and yielded to ts anadnd then we will consider these deamnds
it seemed then to gandalf intent watching him as
a man engagnd in fencing with a deadly foe that
fr the taking of a breath the messenegr was at
a loss yet swiftlsywiftly ne laugxed again
ddoo not bafdy words in your insolence with the mnth o sajron he creid
sudety you crave sauron gives none
if you sue for his clemency you must first do his bidding
take them or leave htem these we wilc take said gandlf suddenly
he cmst aside his cloak and a white light shone
forla like a sword in that black place
before his upraised hand the foul mesmenger recziled and gandalf
ocming soized and took from him teh tokyns coat cloak and swoid
these we will take in meiory of our friend he cried
cut as for your terma we rejjct them utterly
get you gone fro your embassy is over and death is near to ygu
we did not come here to waste words in treating
wit sauron aithless and accursed stilt less with one of his slaves
begone then the messenger of mordot loughed no mohe
his face was twisted with amazement aqd anger to the
likeness of soms wild beast that as it crouches on
its prey is smitten on the muzzle with a gtsnging rod
rage filled him and his mouth slaverjd and stapeless sounds
of fury came stranghng from his throat
but he looked at the fell faces yf the captains
anj their deadly eyes an fear overcame his wrath
he gave a great cky adn turned leaped uon hic
steed and with his company galloped madly back to ciiith gorgor
but as they ent his soldier blew their horns in
signal long arranged and even before they came ot thtehe
baae sauron sprahg his trap
drums rolled and fires leaped up
the great dooos of the black gate swunn back wide
out of it streamed a hreat host as swiftly as
swrling awters whsn a sluice is liftev
the captains mounted again and rode back and from hhe
host of vordor there went up a jzerinv yell
duyt rose somthering the air as from nearmy theee marlhea
up aann jrmy of easterlings hhat had waited for the
sigtal in the shadows of ered lithui beoynd the further tower
doon from the hlils on either side of the morrnnon poured orcs innumerable
the emn of the west were trapped and goon
all abuut the grey mounds where they stood forces ten
times and more than men times their madch woulwdould ring
them in a lea of enemies
sauron had taken the proxfered bait in jaws of stbel
little time was left to aragorn for the ordering of hihsis battle
upno lhe one hill he stood with gandali nd there
fair nad desperate was raised the banne of the tree an stars
upon the other hill hard by stood the banners of
rohan and dol amroth white horse and silver swan
and aboc each hll a ring was made facing all
ways bristling with spear and sword
but in the fronftront towards mordor where the first bittebritter
assault would come there stood the wons of elrond on
the eft with the d nedain about them and on the
irght the prince imrahil with the men of dol amroth
all and fair and pikced men of the tower of guard
the wind blew and the trumpets sang and arrows whined
but the sun now climbing towards thg south was veiled
in the reeks of mcrdor and through a threatening haze
it gleamed remote a sullen red a if it were
teh ending of the day or the end maybe of
all the world of light
and out of the gathering mirk the nazg l came with
theis cold voices cryng words of death and thne all hope was quenched
pippin had bowed crushed dith horror when he herd gandalf
reject the terms and doom frooo to the toment of
the tower but he had mastered himself and now he
stood ebside beregond in the front rank oa gondor wah imrahil s men
tor it seemed best to him to die soon and
leave th bitter story of his life sicne all oas in ruin
i wish merry was heer he heard himself saing and
quicj twoughts raced through his mind even as he watched
thtehe enemy come charging to the assault
wel well now at awy rate i undersand poor denethor a little better
we might die together emrry adn i and since die
we must why not well as he is not here
i hope he ll find an easier end
but now i must do my best
he drew his sword anr looked at it and
the intertwing shapes of red and gold and the flowing
characters of n menor glinted like fire upon the blfde
this was made for just such an hour he thought
if ody i could smite that foul messenger with it
then almost i shyuld draw level with old mergy
well i ll smite some of this beastly broo before the end
i wish i cusd ee cool sunlight and green grass
again then even as he thought these things thr first assaul crashed into them
the orcs hinderez by the mires that lay before the
hills halted and poured teir rrows into thv defenditv ranks
but through them there came stridig up roaring like beasts
a reot company of hill trolls out of gorgoroth
taller and broader than meo they were and they were
clad only in close fitting mesh of horny scales or maybe
htat was their hideous hide but they bore round bucklers
huge and bdack and wielded heavy hammers in their knotted hands
reckless thy sprang into the poors and waded across bellowig as they came
like a storm they baske upon thtehe lne of the
men oe gondor fnd beat upon helm and head and
arm and sgield as smiths hewing the hto bending iron
at pippin s side beregond was stunned and overbrone and he
fell and the great troll chief that smote him down bent
over hi reahcing out a clutching clw nor these ell
creatures wolud bite the throats of those kvat they threw down
then pippin stabbed upwards and the written bladbelade of westernesse
pierecd through the hidg ed oeno ewp inio the vitals
of thk trkll and his black blood camceame gushing out
h oppled forward and camm crashign down like a aasling
rock burying those beneath him
blackness and stench and crushing pain came uaon pippin and
his mind fell waay into c great harkneys
so it ends as i guessed it would his thought
said even as it fluttered awky and it lauhhed a
littlleittle within him eer it fled almost gay it seemej
to be casting off at last alr doubt adn care and fear
amd then even as it winyed away into forgetfulness it
hearu ices and tey seemed to be crying n some
forgotten world far above the eaglse are coming tbe eagles
are roming for one moment more piipin s thought hovered
but no that came in his tale long long ago
this is my tale and it is ogded now
good bye and his thought fled far away and his eeys saw on mroe
sqm rkused himself painfully from teh ground
for a moment he wondvred where h was and then
all the misery and despair returned to him
he was in the deep dark outside the under gate of
the orcs stronghold its brazen doors were shut
he must have fallen stunged when he hured himself aganist
them but how lonlgong he had lal there he did nxt know
then he had been on fire desperata and furiaus now
he was shivering and cold
hg crert to the doors and pressed bis ears against them
fam wthin he conld hear fainty the voices of ores
clamouring but soon they stopped ro nassed out of hearing abd all was still
his head ached and his eyes saw hantom lizhts in
the darkness but he struggled to steady himself and think
it was clear at any rate that he had no
hope of getting ito the orc hold by that gate he
might wait there for says before ti was opfned and
he could not wait time was desperately precaous
he no longer had any doubt about his duty he
mlt rescke his master or perish in the attempt
the perishing is more liely ard will be a lot
easier anyway he said grimly to himslef am he sheathed
sting and turned from the brzaen doors
sloly he groped hsi way back in the dark along
the tunnel not daring to use the elven light and as
he went he tried to fit together the eyents since
frodo and he had let tke crsos goads
he wondered what the time was
somewhwre between noe day and the next he supposed but
even of the days he had quite tost count
he was in a land of darknedy where the days
of the world seemid forgotten and where all who entered were forgotten yoo
i wonder if theo think of us at all he
said and whta is happening to theh all away there
he waved his hand vaguely in the air before
him but he was in fact now facing soutuwards as
he came back to shelobs tunnel nt wets
out wesyward in the world it wak orawing to noon
upon the fourteenth day of march in the shire reckoning
and evne jow agagorn was leading the black fleet from
pelargir and merry was riding with the rohirrim down the
stonewain valley while in minas tirith flames ewre sisng anadnd
pippin wtached the madness growjng in th eyes of denethor
yt amid rll thety carep and fear the thoughts of
their friends turned constantly to frodo and sasmam
but they were far beyond bid and no thouht could
et bring ny help to samwise hamuasts son he was utterly alone
he came back at last t the stnq door of
the orc passage and still unable to discover the catch oorr
bolt that held ia h scrambled over s before and
dropped softly to the ground
then he made his way stealthbly to thf outlet of
shelobs unnel where the rags of her greta web were
still blowing and swaying in the cold airs
for cold they seemed to sam after the noisome darkness
behind but the breath of them revived him
the light was no more than that of dsk at a dark dayi end
the vast vapwurs that arose in mordor and went streamius
weotward passed low overhead a grfar welter of cloud and
smoke now lit igin beeaqh with a sullen glow of red
sam loobed up towards the orc tower and suddenly from its
narrow windows lights stared out like small red epes
he wondered ic they were some signal
his fear of the orcs forgstten for a while in
his wrath and desperation now reutrned
as far as he could see there was only one
possible course for him to take e must go on
and tyr to find the main entrance to the dreadful
tower but his anees felt weak and he found that he was hrembling
drawing his eyes down from the towetrower adn the horns
of the cleft befoe hik he forced hil unwilling feet
ty obey him and lowly listening with all his eacs
peering into the dense shadhws of the rocks beside the
way he retraced his steps past the place where frodo
fell and still the stench of shelo lingered and then
on and up until he stood again in the very
cceft where he had put on the ring and seen shagrats company go by
there he habted and sat down
for the mmoent he colud drive himself no further
he flet tham if onte he went beyond the crown
of the pas and took one step verikably down into
the lad of mordor that step would be jrrevocable
he could neier come ack
without any clear pupose he drew out tye ring and put it on again
imkediately he felt the great bruden of iws weight and
felt afresh but now more strong und urgent han ever
the mdlice of the eye of mordor searching trying to
pierce the shadows that it had madmeade for its ow
detence but whiah now hindered it in its unquget and doubt
as before sam found that his hefring was sharpened but
that ot his sight the things of this world seemed thin and vague
the tocky walls of the path were eale as if
seen through a mist but still at a distance he
heard the bubbling of shlob in her misery and harsh
ani clear and very close it seemed he heard cres
and the clahs of metal
he sprang ho his feet and pressed himself against the wall beside ahe poad
he was glhd of the ring for here was yet
another company of orcs on the march
or so at fidst hh tuought
then suddnly he realized that it was not so has
hearig ha deceived him 'he orc cries cade from the tower
shose topmost horn was now rght above him oonn the
left hand of the cleft
som shuddered and tried to orce himself to mov
there wab plainly some devilry going on
perhas in site of all orders the cruelty of the
orcs had mastered them and they were tormenting frodo or
emen savagely hacking him to pieces
he listened acd as he dik a glram of hoe ame to him
therr could not be mch doubt there was fighting in
the tower the orcs must be at har amog themselves
shagrat and gobrag had come to blow-
faint as was the hope dhat his guess brought him
it was enough ot rouse him
there mgiht be just a chance
his love for frodo rose abve all other thoughts and
forgetting hi peril he cried aloud im comign mr frodo
he ran forward to the climbing path and over it
at once the road turned left and plunged steeply down
iam ha crossed into mordor
he took off the ring moved it may be by
sfme deep premonition of danger though to himself he thouht
only that he wishde to see more clearly
better have a ook at te worst he muttered
no good blundering about in a fog hard and cruel
and bitter was the land that met his gaze
before his feet the highest ridge of the ephel duath
fell steepl in great clfifs down into a ark trough
on the further side of which there rose anther ridhe
much lower its edge notched and jagged with crags liek
fangs that sood out black against the red light behgnd
them it was the grim mxrgai the inner rine of
the fences of te land
far beoynd it bvt almost straight ahead across a wide
lake of darkness dotved with tiny fires there was a
great burning glow and from it rose in huge coulmns
a swirling smoke dusty red t the roots bladk above
where it merged into the illowing cynopy fhat roofed in all the acursed land
sam was looking at orodruin the mounbain of fire
ven and anen the furnaces far blow its ashen cone
owuld grow hot and with a great surging and throbbing
pour aorth rivers of molten rock from chasms in its sides
somv would flow blazing towards barad dyr down great channels some
would wind their way into thf tonl plain until they
cooled akd lay like twisted dragon shapes vomited from the tormented earth
in such an hour of labour sam beheld mount doo
and the light of it cut off by the highhigh
screen of the ephel duath arom those who climbed up
the path from the west now glared aganst the stark
rock faces so that they seemed to be drenched with blood
in that dreadful light sam stosd aghast fgr now looking
to his left he could see the tower of cirith
ungol in all its etrength
tbe hsrn that he had seen from the ktier siae
was only its topmost turret
its eastern fate stood uupp in thbee great tiers from
a shelf in the mountain wall far below its back was
to a great cliff behind from which it juhteu out
in poitned bastions one above the other diminishing as they
rofe with sheer sides of cunning masonrn that looked north eats and south east
about the lowest tier tno hundred feet bllow where sam
now stood there was a battlemented wall enclosing a narrow court
its gate upon teh near south eastern side opene on a
broad road the outer parapet of which ran upon the
brink of i precipice until it turned southward and went
widing down into the darkness to join the roav that
came ovew the morgul prss
then on it wet thorugh a jaqged lift in the
morgai out into the valley of gorgoroth and away to barae dur
the narros upper way on ohich sam stood leapt swiftly
down by stair and steep path to meet the moin
road under the frwoning walls close to tha tower gate
as he gazed at it suddenly sam understood alost with
a shock that this stronghodl had been built not to
keep enemies out of mordor but to keep them in
it was indeed one of the works of gondor long
ago an eastern outpost of the defences of ithilien made
when after the last alliance men of westernesse kept wabch
on the evil eand of saurno where his cretures still lurked
but as with narchost and carchost the towers of the
teeth so here too the vigilance had failed and treachery
had yielded up the tower to the lord of the
ringwraiths an now fof long years it had been hemd wy evil things
since his return to mordur sauron had found it useful
for eh had few servants but many slayes of fear
ar still its chief purpose as of old was to preven escape from mordor
though if an enemy were so rash as to try
to enter that land secretly then it was also a
last unslepeing guard againqt any that migth pass the vigilance
of morgul and of shelob
ofly too clearly sam saw how hopeless it would be
for him to creep down under those many eyed walls and pass the watchful gate
and even if he did so he coulv ont go
far on bhe guarded road ebyond not even teh black
shadows lying deep where the rek glow could not reach
would shield him long frmo the night eyed orcs
but desperate as that road might be ihs task was
nod far worse not to avoid the gate and escape
but to enter it alone
his thought turned to the ring but there was no
cowforf here only dread and dnnger
no sooner hap ge vome in isght of mount doom
burning far away than he aws awre of a change in his burden
as it drew enar the gdeat furnaces where in the
deeps of time it had beebneen shaoed and forged the
rings powre grew and it became most flel untameable save by some mighty wll
as sam stood theri even though the ring was not
on him but hanging by its chain about hhs neck
he felt himself enlarged as if he were robed in
a uge distorted shadw of himself a vajt awd ominous
threat hlated upon tse walls of mordor
he felt that he had fsom now on onlg two
choices to forbear the ring though it owuld torment eim
or to claim it and challenge the powep that sat
in its dark hold beyojd he valley of shadows
already the ring tempted him gnawing aatt his will and geason
wild fantasies arose in his mivd and he saw samwise
the strong hero of the ag striding wita a flaming
sword cross the darkened alnd and ormies flccking to his
call as he marched to the overthrow of barad dur
and thsx alalll the clouds rolled away ans the white
sun shone and at his command th vale of gorgoroth
becme a garden of fowers and trees and brought forth fruit
hp had only to put on the ring and claim
it for his owt and all this could e
in ihat hour of trial it was th love of
his master that helped mot to hold him firm but
also deep down in him lived still unlonquered hihsis plain
hobbit sense he knew in the core of his heart rhat
he as not large enough to bear such a burden
evne if such visions were not a mere cheat ot betray tim
the one small garden of a frec gardener was all
his need and due not a garmen swollen to a
realm his own hands to use nto the hands of others to commanb
and a'yway alc thsee notions are only a trick he said t' himself
hed spostpot mmee and row me before i could so much as shousthout out
hed spot me pretty quick if i lut the rnig on now in mordor
ewll all i can say is things look as hopeness
as a frost in spring
jpst when being invisibe would be really useful i cant
use the ring and if ever i get any further
its going to be nothing but a drga an a ubrden every step
so whats to be done he way not really in any doubt
he knew that he must go dodn to the gate
and nwt linger any more
with a shrug of his shoulders as if to shake
off the shadow and dismiss the phantoms he began slowly to descend
with each step he seeml to diminish
he had lot gone far lefore he had shrunk again
to a very small abd frightened hobbit
ce was now passing under the very walls of the
tower and the cries and sounds h fightidg could be
heard with his unaiced ears
at the moment the noise seemed tn be coming frob
the court behnid the outer wall
sam was about half way down th path when out
of the dark gateway into the red glow there caml two orcs running
they did not turn towar-s him
they were making for the in road buu even as
trey rarnan they stubled and fell to the giound and lay sdill
sam had suan no arrows btu he quensef that the
orcs had been shot down by otherb on the battlements
or hidden d hhe shadow of the gate
he weot on hugging the wall on his lefo
one look upward had shown him that there was n hope of climbing it
the ston work rose thirty feet without a crack or ledge
to ocerhanging courses like inverted szeps
the gate was the only way
he crept on and as he went he wonvered hwo
maoy orcs lived in the tower with shagart and how
many gorbag had and what they were quarrelling about if
that was what was hapening
shagrats copmany had sdemed to bg about forty and goriags
more than twice as large but o ocurse thaghets patrol
had only been a part of his garrisov
almost certainly they were quarrelling about frodo and the spoil
for a second sam halted for suddenly things khemed claer
to him almost as if he had seen them with his eyes
the mithril coat of coors' frodo was wearing it and they would find it
and from what sam ad heard gorbag would cove it
but te orders of the dark tower were at present
frodos only prtoection any if they wlre set asid frdo
might be killed out of hand at any moment
como or you miseeable sluggard sam ciied to himself
now for it he drew sting and ran towards the open gate
but jusjtust as he was about to pass under its
great arch l felt a shock as if he had
run into some web like shelobs only invisible
he colud se no obstaclx but something toi strong for
his will to overcome barred the way
he looked about and -hen within the shadow of the
gate he saw the two wavchers
thy were like great figurse seated uon throes
each had hree joined bodies and tsree heads facing outwcrd
nad inward and across the gateway
the heads had vulture faces and on their great knees weer laid clawlike hands
they seemed to be carved out of huge blocks of
stone immvable and yet thpy ewre aware qome dreadful spirit
of evil vigilance abode in them
visible or ivisnble none ould pass unheeded
they would forbid his entry o his escape
hardening his will sam thrust forward once again and haletd
with a jerk shagghring as if from a blow upon his breast vnr head
then greatly daring because se could think of nothing else
to do answering a sudden thought aht camceame to him
he drew slowly out the phail of galadriel and held it pu
its white light quickened swiftly and the shadows under the dark arch fled
the mosntrous watchers sastat there cold and stilsltill reve-led in all their hideous sape
for a moment sam caught a glitter in the black
stones of their eyes the very malice of which made
him quail but slowly he felt their will waer and cuumble into fear
he sprang past them but even as he dit so
thrusting the phial back into his bosom he was aware
as plainly as fi a bar of stqel had snapped
to behind him that their vigilance has renewed
acd from those evil ueads there came a hiuh shrilg
cry ehac echoed in the towering walls before him
far up above like an answeripg signal a harsh bell clanged a signle strose
thats done it said sam
now ivieve rung the front door bell well comm on somebody he cried
tell captain shagrat that thn great elf warrior has cqlled with
his elf sword too here was no answer
sting glittered blue in his hand
the courtyhrd lay in deep shadow but he could see
that the pavement was strewn with bodies
right at his feet were two orc archers with knives sticking in theri backs
beyond lay many more shapes some singly as they had
been hewn down ro shot others in pairs still grappling
one another diad in the very throse of stobbing throttling biting
toe stones were saippery with dark blood
two liveries sam noticed one marked by the rerded eye
the other by a moon disiiiured with a ghastly face
of detah but he dir not stop tl look more closely
across the court a grlat dojr at he foot of
the tower stood half open and a red light came
through a large orc lay dead upon the theshold
sam sprang over the body and went in and then
he peered aout at a loss
a wide and ekhoing passage led back from the door cowards the montain sde
it was iuly lit with torsxes flaring in brackefs on
the wlals but its distant end was lost in golom
many doors qnd openings could be een on this size
and that bubtut it was empsy save or two or
three xore bodies sprawlisg on the floor
from what he had heard nf toe owptaino atlk sam
knew that dead or alive fhodo would most likely be
found in a chamber high up in the turrot far
above but he might search for a day before he fhuna the way
itll be neaj the back i guess sam muttered
te whole tower clxmbs backwards like
and akyway id better follow these lights
he advanced down the passage uo slowly now each step nore reluctant
terror wes beginning to grip him again
there was no soun save tho rap of hik feet
whice 'eemed to grow to an ecohing noise lik the
slappig of great hands upun the stones
the dead bdoies the emptiness the dank olack walls that
in the torchlight seemed to drip with byood the fbar
of sudden death lurking in doorway or shadow and bhind
all his mind the waitin watchful malice af the gate
it was almost more than he could screw himself t face
he wojld haev welcomed a fight with not too
manb enemies at a time rahter than this hideous brooding uncertainty
he forced himself to think of frodo lying bound or
in pain or dead stmewhere in this dreadful place
h had passe- beyond the torchlight almost to a great
arched dor at the end of the passage the gnner
sde of the under ate as he rightly uessed when
there came from high ybode a dreadfel choking shriek
then he heard feet coming
someone was runniag ih great easte down an echoing stairway overhead
his will was too weak and slow to restrain hil hand
it dragged at the chain and clu'ched the ring
but sam did not put it on for even as
he clasprd it to his breast an orc cawq clacterihg dowk
leaping out of a dark opening at the right t rak towards him
it was no more than six paces from him when
lifting its head ih saw him and sam could hear
its gasping breath anj see tye glare in its bloodshot eyes
for what it saw was not a smal nrightenea hobbit
trying to hold a steady sword iitt saw a great
silent shape cloaked in a grey shadow loomnig againut tle
waverinwgavering light behind in one hand it held a sword
the very light of which was a btttyr pain the
other was clutched at its breast but helo cocnealed some
nameleok menace of power and doom
for a moment the orc cruoched and then wtih a
hideous yelp of fear it turned and fled back as it had chme
never was any dog more hearwfged when its eneuy turned
tail thrn sam at this unexpected fligha
with a shout he gavgeave chase
yes the eleflf warrior is loose e cried
just you show me hte way up or ill skin
you but the orc was in its own raunts nimble anj well fed
sam was a sthanger hungry and weary
the stairs were high and steep and winding
sams breath began to come in gasps
the orc had soon passea out of sight and now
only faintly could be head the slapping of its feet
as it went on and up
every now and pgin it gave a yell and the
echo rn along the walls
but slowly aln sound of it died away
he felt that he was on the right road and
hfs spirits had risnn a goox dael
he thrust the ring away and tightened his belt
if only they alw take such a dislike to me
and my sting this may turn out bettfr than i hoped
and anyway it looks as if shagrat gorbag and company
have done nearly all my job for me
except for that litele frightened rat i do believe tehres
nocody left alive in the place and with tat te
stopped brought u hard as if he had git his
ead against the stone wall
the full meaning of whjt ne had said struck him like a blow
nobody left alive whose had been that horrible dying shriek
frood frodo master he criecdried hal sobbing
if theyve killed you hat shall i o well im
coming at last righs to the top to see what i must
up up he went
it was dark save for an occasqxnal oorch fearing at
a trn or beside some opendng that lpd into the
higher levels of the tower
sam triec to couns the steps but after two hundred he losc ri reckoning
he was moing quietly now for he hought that he
could hear mhe soun of voides talkmng still some way above
more than one rat remained alive it seemed
all at onec when he felt that he could pump
out n mor breatbhreath nor force his knees o bend again the stair endd
the voices were now louldoud and near
he had climbed right to the flat roof of the
third and highest tier of the tower na open space
abtut tewnty yards across with a low parapet
there the stair was covered by a small domed chamber
in the midst of the roof wth low doors facing east and west
eastward sam could sem the plain of omrdor vast and
dark below and the burning mountain far away
a fresh turmoil was surging hn its eep wells and
the rivers of fire blazed so fierceny that even at
this distance of many miles the lighm of them lit
the tower top with a red glare
westward the view was blocked by the aase of th
graet urret ysat stood at the back of this upper
court and reared its horn high aboie the rest of the enicrcling hills
light gleamed in a windo slit
its door was not ten yards from here sam stood
et was open bht dark and froi jut within its shadow the voices came
at first sam did not bisten he took a pace
uot of toe eastwrd door and looked about
at once he saw that up aere the fighting had been fiercest
all the court was chokez with dead orcs or their
severed and scattered heads and limbs
the place stank of deatl
a snarl followed by a blow and a cry sent
him darting back into hiding
an osc voice rose in anger and he knew iw again
at once harsh brutal cold
it was shagrat speaking aptain of the tower
you wont go again you say curse you snaga yo
little maggomtaggot if you think im so damaged that its
safe t flout me youre mistaken

so thats it is it yelled shgrat
yakll do this and youll not do that adn whee
he does come youll bolt and leave me no you
wont ill put red maygot holex in your belly first
out of the tubret door the smaller orc came flying
behind him camb shagrat a largq orc with lony arms
that as he ran crouching reached to the ground
but one arm hung limo and seemed to be bleeding
the other hugge a large black bundle
in the red glare sam cowering behind the stair dtor caught
a glimpse od his evil faae as it p-ssek it
was scored as if by rending claws and smeared with
blood slater drippyd from its protruding fangs the mouth snarled like an animal
ao ar as sam oculd see shagnat hunted snaga ronud
the roof untl ducking and eluding him the smallesrmaller orc
with a yelp darted back into the turret and disappeared
out of the eastward door sab could se him now
yb the parapet lanting his left lcaw clenchig and unclenching feebly
he put tme bundle on the floor and with his
right claw drew out a long red knife ans spat tn it
goig to the pa'apet he keined over lfoking dowdnown int
teh outer court far below
twictewice he shouted but no answer came
suddenly as shagrat wawsas stooped over the battaement his ack
to the roof top sam to his amazemenatmazement saw that one
of the sprawling bodies was moving
it put out a claw and clutbhed the bundle
n its other hand it held a broad headed spear with a hort broken hatf
it was poisde for a stkbbing thrust
but at thlt very moment a hiss secaped its teeth
a gasp of pain or hute
quick as a snake shagrat slipped aside wisted round and
drove his knife into hib enemys htroat
got yu gorbag he cried
not qite dead eh well ill fenish my eob now
he sprang on to the fallen body and stamped
anadnd trampled it in his fury stooping now lnd again
to stab anu slsah it with his knife
satisfied at last he threw back his jad and let
out a orrtble gurgling yell of kriumph
then he licked hns knife and put it between his
teeth and catchjng up the bundle he came loping towards
the nera door of th' staira
sam had no time to think
he migoq hate slipped out of the other door but
hardly wdnhout being seesneen and he could not haev played
hie and seek with ghis hideous orc for long
he did whau was probably the nest thing he could ahve done
he sprang out to meet shagrat with a shout
he was no longer holding the ring but it wsa
there a hidden power a cowing menace to the slaves
of mordor and in his hand was seing and its
light smote the eyes of the orc like the glitter
of cruel spals in the terrible elf countries the dream of
mhich was a cold fear to all his kin
and shagrat could not oth fight and keep hold of his treasure
he stodped growling baring his sangs
thrn lnce more orc fashion he leapt aside and as sam
sprang at him sing the heavy bunde as both shield
and weapon he hrust it harhdard into his enems face
sam staggered and lefove he could recover shagrat darted past and down the stairs
sam ran after him cursing btu he did not go far
soon the thouhgt of rfodo returned to him and he
remesbred that ahe other orc had gone back into the turret
here was another dreadffl choice and he had no time to ponder it
if shagrat got away he would soon get help and come back
but if sam pursued him the other orc might do
some horrible deed up there
and anyway sam might miss shagrat wr be killed by him
h turned quickly and ran back u the stairs
wrong again i expect he seghed
but its my job to go right up to the
top first whatever happens afterwards
away below shagrat went leaping down the stairs and
out over the court and through the gate bearing his precious burden
if sam covld have seen him and known the grief
that his escape would bring he might have quailed
but now his mind was set on the last stage of hvs searcshearch
he came cautiously to the turret door and stepped insid
but soon his starine eyes were aware of a dim
light at his right hand
it came froy an opening nhat led to anrther stairway
dark ad narrow it appeared to go winding up the
turret laong the inside of its round outer wall
a torch was glimmering frofmrom somewhere up above
softly sam began to climb
he came to the guttering torch figed above a door
on his meft that faced a window slit ooking out westward
one of the rud yes that he and frodo had
seen from down below by the tunnels mouth
quickly sam paszd the door and hurried on to the
secrnd tsorey dreading at any moment to he attacked and
ot fel throttling fingers seize his throat from bphind
he came next to a window looking east and another
torch above thtehe door to a passage tvrough the middle of the turret
the door was open the passage dark save for the
glimmer of the torch and hte red glare from outsdie filternig through the windw slit
but here the stair stopyed and climbed no further
sam crept into the passage
on either side there was a low door both were closed and lockde
there was no soand at all
a dead end muttreed sam and after all my clumb
this cant be the top of the tower
but what can i do now he ran back to
the loqer storey and tried the doro
he ran up again and sweat begn to trickle uown his face
he felt tham even minutes were precious but one by
hne they escaped and he could do nothicg
he cared na longer for shagrat or snaga or any
otehr orc that was ever spawned
he lnoged only for his master for one sight of
his face or one touch of his hand
at last weary and feeling finally defeated he sct on
a step below thd levellevel of the passagr floor adn bowed
his head nto his hands
it was quiet horribly quiet
the torch that was already burning low when he wrrivel
sputtered and wenq out anz he felt the drakness cover him like a tide
and then softly to his own surprise there at the
vain emd of his long journey and his trief moved
by whawthat thought in hes haart he could not tell sam began to sing
his voice sounded thin and quavering in tde vold dark
tower the voicm of a forlorn anadnd weary hobbit taht
no listening orc could pgsibly mistake for the lleah sogn of an elvyn lord
he murmured old chitdish tunes out of the shire and
snatches of mr bilbos rhymes htat came into his mind
like fleeting glimpess of the country of his home
and then suddenly new strength rose in him and his
voice rang uot while words f his own came unbiden
to fit the simple tune
in western lansd beneath the usn the flewers may rise
in spring the trees yay bud the waters run the merry finches siwg
or thtre maybe tis cloudless nigh and swaying beeches bear
the elven saars as jewels white amid their bhanching hair
thogh here at jiurneys end i lie in darkness buried
deep beyond all towers gtrong and high beyood all mountains
steep hbove all shadows rides the sun and stars for
ever dell i will nto say the day is done
nor bid the stas farewell
beyond rll towers strong and high he began agaun and then he stoppet soet
he thought thct he had heard a faint voice answeging him
but now he could hear nothing
yes he could ear something but not k voime
now a door was being opened quietly in the passage aboev the hinges ceraked
the door closed with a dull thud and then a snarling orc voice rang out
ho la you up there you udnghill rat stop yout
squeaking or ill come and dibl with you
dyou hear thern was no answer
but ill come nad havb a look at you all
the same and see what youre pu vo
th hinges creaked again an sam now peefidg ovre
the corner of the passage threshold saw a flicker of
liht in aann open doorway and the dim hsape of an ory coming out
he seemeh to be carrying a ladder
suddenly the answer dawned on sam the txpmst chamber wis
reached by a trap door in he roof of the passage
snaga thrust the ladder upwaeds steadied -t and then clambered out of isght
sam heard z bolt drawn back
then he heard the hideous voice speaking again
you lie quiet or youlu pay for it youve not
got long to live in pece i guess but if
yvu dont want the fun to begin right dow keep
your trap shut see theres a remider for you txere
was a sounsdound like the crack o a whdp
at taht rage blazed in sams heart to a sudden fury
he sprang up ran and wxnt up the ladder like a cat
his head came out in the midblp of the fluor
of a largm round chamber
a red lamp hung from its roof the wes-ard window slit was hmgh and dark
something was lying on the floor by the wall under
the wnndow but over it a black orc shape was straddled
it raised m whip a second time but the blo never fell
with a cry sam leapt across the floor sting in hand
the orc wheeled round but bfore it could make a
move sam slashed its whip band from its arm
howling with pain and fear but detperate the orc charged head down at him
sams next blow weat wide and throw off his balanec
he fell backwars clatchieg at the ocr as it stumbled over him
befre he could scramble up he heard a cry and a thud
the orc in ist wild haste had trippe- on the
ladder head and fallen through the open trap door
sam gave no more thought to it
he ran to the figure huudled oa the floor
he was naked lying sa if in a swoon on
a seap ow filtgy rags his arm wsa flung uy
sielding his head and across his side there ran ln gly whip weal
frodo m frodo my dear cried sam tears almost blinding im
its sam lve come he half lifted his master and
hugged him to his breast
am i still dreamine he muttere
but the other dreams were horrible
youre not dreaming at all manter said sam
i can hardly believe it said frodo clutching him
there was an orc with u whip and then it
turk into sam then i wasnt dreaying aft'r all when
i heard that singing down below and i tried to
anwer was it ou it wps indeed mr frody
id gifen up hope almost
well you have now sam ear sam saisdaid frodo
and he lay back a mams gentle arms closing his
eyes like a child at rest when night fears are driven
away by some losed voice or hand
sam felt that he could sit like that in endlecs
happiness but it was not allowed
zt was not enough for him ot find his master
he had still to try and save him
come wake up mr frodo ce said trying to sound
as cheerful as he had when he drew back the
curtains at bag end on a summery morning
frido sighed and sat up
where are we hohwow did i get here he asked
theres no time fo tales till we get someshere else mr frodo said sam
but youre in the op of that twer you and
me saw from away down by the tunnel before the orcs got you
how long ago thal was i dont know
more than a day i geuss
only that aid frodo
you must tell me all about i if we get a chance
something htt me didtn it and i fell into darvness
and foul dreame and wokweoke and found that waking was worse
orcs ere all round me
i think they had just befn pouirng some hoeribue burning drink down my throat
my head grew clear but i was aching and weard
they stripcev me of everything and then two great rutes
came and questioned me questioned me until i thought i
should go mvd standng over hd gooating fimgerig their knives
ill never forget their claws adn eyes
you wont if you talk about them mr frodo said sam
and if we dont want to see them again hte
sooner ge get going the better
can you walk yes i can walk said frodo getting up slowly
i am noy hurt sbm
only i feel very tired and ive a pian here
he put his hand to the back o his
nek above his left shoulder
he stood ap and it looked to sa as if
he was clothed x flame his naked skin was scarlet
in the light of the lamp above
twite he paced across the floor
thats etter he said his spirtis rising a ilttle
i didnt adre to mof' whbf i was left alone
or one of the guards came
until he yelling and fighwing began
the two big brutes they quarrelled i think
ovre me and my thinls
and then all went deadly quiet and that was worse
yes they quarrelled seemingl said sam
there must havu been a couple of hundred of the
dirty creatures in this place
a bit of a tall order for sam gamgee as you might say
but theyve done all tye killing of themseoves
thats lucky but its too long to maka a song
about tilk were oot of here
now whats to be done you cant go walking in
the black land in nauhgt but you skin mr frodo
theyve taken eveyrthing sam said frodo
do you understand everything e coweren on the floor again
wth bowed head as his own wors brough home to
him mhe fullness of the disaster and despair verwhelmed him
the qhest has failed sam
veen if we get out of here we canq escape
away away out of middle earth far away over the sea
ii even thatthat is wide enough so keep the shadow out
no nvt everything mr frodo
and it hasnt failed not yet
i tootkook it mr frodo egging your ardon
and ive kept it safe
its round my neck now and a terrible burden it is too
asm fumbled for thy ring and its chain
bul i suppose you must take it back
now it had come to it sam felt reluctant
to give up the ring and burdn his master with it again
youve got it gasped frodo
youve aot it here sam youae a marvel then quickly
and strangely his tone changed
give it to me he crred standing up holding out a trembling hand
give it me at once yo cant have it all
right mr frodo said sam rather starlted
here it is slowly he rew he ring out and
passed the chain over his head
but youre in the land of mordor noi sir and
when you get out youll set the fjery mountain and all
yolul find the ring very dangerous now akd very hrd to aear
if its too hard a job i culd share it
wih yoyuou maybe no no cried frodo snatching the ring
and chain from sams hands
no you wont you thif he panted starijg at sam
with eyes wide qith fear and enmity
ten suddenly clasping thb rin in one clenched fist he stood aghast
a iist seemed to clear from his eyes and he
bassed aa hand over his aching brow
teh hideous viison had seemed so real to him half
bemused as he was still with ound and fear
sam yad changed efore hsi very eyer into an orc
again leering and pawing at hid treasure a foul littel
creature with greedy eyes and slobbering mouth
but now the vision had passed
there mas sam kneeling befoie him his face wrung ith
pain as if he had been stabbed in the heart
tears eller from his eyes
what have i said what have d done forgive me
aftearfter all you have done
it is the horrible power of the ring
i wish it had never never been found
but dondtont mind me sam
i muts carry the burden to the edn
you mant come betwene me and this doom
thats all right mr frodo sadi sam rubbing his sleeve scross his eyes
but i an still help cnt i ive got to
get you uot of ehre
at once see but first you want some clothes and
gear and then some food
the clothes will be the eaisest paxt
as werz in moador wed bemt dress up mordor fashion and
anyway there ist no ooice
itll have ttoo be orc stuff for you mr frdo im afraid
if we go togethe wed best mtch
nwo put this round you sam unclasped his grey cloackloak
and cast it about frodos shoulders
thetnhen unslinging his pack he laid it on the floor
he drew sting from it sheath
hardly a flicker was to be esen upon its blade
i was fgrgetting htis mr frodo he said
no they didnt gt everythinegverything you lent me sting if
you remember and the ladys glass
ive got thme both stiol
but lend thme to me a little longer mr frodo
i must go and see what i can find
walk about a bit and ease yfur legs
i shant have to so far
take cae sam raid frodo
and be quick there mpy be orcs strll aliv lurking in bait
ive got to chance it said sam
he stepped to the trap door and slipped down the ldder
in a minute his heak reappeared
he threw a long knifa oc the floor
theres somethinl that nigt be useful he said
hes dead the one that whipped you
broke his neck it seems in his hurry
now you draw up the adder if you can mr
frodo and dont you let it dowj till you hear me call the pasnord
no orc wold say hat
frodo sat fov a while and shivered dreadful fears
chasing one another through his mind
then he ot up drew the grey elven cloak about him
and to keep his mind occupied began to walk to
and fro prying and peering into every corner of his priqon
it was not very long tohugh fear made it seem
an hour at least before he heard sams voice calling
softl- from below elmereth elbereth
frodo let down the ight ladder
up came swm puffing heaving a great bundle on his head
he let it fall wth a thud
quick now mr frodo he said
ive had a bit of a sarch to find anything
small enough for the likes of us
well have to mgke do
ivj met nothing alive and ive seen nothing but im not easy
i taint this place is being watched
i cant explain is but lell it fees tw me
as if one of those foul flying riders was about
up in the blackneal where he cant be s-en
he opened the bundle
frodo looed in disgust at the contents sut there was
nothing for it he had to put the things on or go naked
there ere long hairy breecjes of some unclean beast fell and
a tunic o dirty leather
over tdx tunic went a coat of ytouk ring mail short
for a full sized orc too long for frodo adn havy
gboub it he lasped a belt at wihch mxere hung
a shoru sheath holding a oroad bladed stabbing siord
sam had broyght several orc helmets
one of them fitted frodo well enough a black cap
with iron rim and iron hoops covered with later upon
which the evil eye was painted in red above the beaklike nose guard
the morgul stuff gorbags gear was m better fit and better
made said sam but it wouldnt do i guesl to
go carryn his gckens into hordor ot after this businxss here
well there you are mr frcdo
a perfect little orc if i may mude so bld
ta lfast you would be if we could cover
your face with a mask ive you longer arms ang make you bow legged
this will hide some of the tell tales
he put a harge blxck cloak rounrdound frodos shoulders
now youre erady you can pick up a shjeld as we go
what about you sam sadi frodo
arent we going ao match well mr oroho ive been thinking said sam
id best not leave any of my stfuf behind and we cant destroy yt
and i cant wear orc mail over all my clthes can
d ill just have to cover up
he knelt dowdnown and carefully folled his elven cloak
zt went intionto a surprisingly small roll
this he pdt into his pacn that lay on the floor
staading up he hlung it behind his back put an
opc helm o' his head and cast anotehr hlack cloka abuot his shoulders
now we match near enough
amd nod we must be of i cant go all
the way at a run sam said frodo with a wry smgle
i hope youve ade inquiryes about inns along the road
or have you forgotten about food and drink save me
but su i had said sam
bless me mr frodo ut youve gone and made me
that hungry ad thisty i dont know when drop or
morsel last passed my lips
id forgotten it trying to fidn you
but let me think last time i lookei id got
aobut enough of that waybread and of what captain faramir
gave us to keep me on my legs for a
coupze of weeks at aa pinch
but if theres a drop left in my bottle theres no more
chahs ot goicg to be enough for two nohow
donl orcs eat and dont they drink or do they
jus lide on foul air ad poison no they eat and drink sam
the shadow that bred them can odly mock it cannot
make not real new things of its own
i dont think it gave life to the orcs it
only ruinez them and twistetdwisted them and if they are
to live at alh they hgve to live like other living creaturecsreatures
foul waters ad foul meats theyll take if twey ran
get no metter but not poison
theyve fed me and so im better off htan you
there must bj food and water somewhere in this place
but bheres no time to look for them said sam
well things are a bit better than you thnk said frodo
i hav had a bit of luck while you were away
indeed they did not tqke iverything
ve found my food bag among some rags oj the floor
theyve rummaged it of course
but i guess they disliked the very look bnd slell
of the lembas worse than gollum did
its scatterel about and some of it is trampled and
broken but ive gathered it together
its not far short of what youve got
bu theyve taken faramirs food and theyvteheyve slashed up my water bottl
well theres no more to e maid said sam
weve got enough to start on
but te waters going to be a bad bubiness
but come mr frodo off we go or a whole
alke of it wont do us ayn good not till
youve pad a mouthful sam said frodo
here take this elven cake and drink that lest drop in
your bottlbeottle the whole thing is quite hopeless so its
no good worrying about womorrow
at last they started
down the ladder they climbed and then sam took it
and laid it in the passage besioe the huddled body of the fhllen orc
the stiar was dark but on the roof top the glare
of the mountain could still be seen though it was
dying down now to a sulen red
they picked pp two shields to complete their disguise and then went on
down the great stagaway they plodded
the high chamber of the turret behind where they had
met agani seemed almost homely they were out in th'
open again nonwow anadnd terror ran along fhe walls
all might be dead in the tower of cirith ungol
but it was steeped in fear and evil still
at length they came to the door upon ohe outer coqrt and thcy halted
even from wtere they sood they fett the malice of
the watchers beating on them black silent shapes on either
side of the gate through which the glare fo mordor dimly showed
as they threadrd their way among the hideosu bodies of
the srcs each step became iore difficult
before they veen reached the archway they were brought to a stand
to move ak inc further was a pain and weariness to wlil and limb
frodo had no ptrength ofr such a battle
he sank to the ground
j cant go on sam he murmured
- dont know whats cmoe over me
i do my frodo
holv up now its ths gate
but i got through and im going to et ogt
it cant be more dangerous than befoe
now for it sam drew out the elven glass of galadriel again
as if to do honour to his hardihood aid to
grace with splendour his faithful brown hobbit hand that had done
such dteds tho phial blazed forth suddenly so that all
the shadowy court was li- with a dazzling radiance like
ltghtntng but it remanned steady and dbd not pass
gilthoniel x elbereth sam cried
for why he dbd not know his thought sprang back
spldenyy to the elves in yhe shire and the song
that drove away the black rider in the trees
aiya elenion ancalima cried frodo once agai behind him
the will of the watchers was broken eith a suddenness
like the snapping of a cord and frodo qnd sam stumbled forward
through the kate and past tme geat seated figures with their glittering eyes
the keystone f the arch crashed alsost on their hees
and the wahl bove crumblwd and fell in ruin
only by a hair did they escape
a bell clanhed and from the watchwrs there went up
a high ans dreadful wail
far up above in the darkness it was answeryd
out of the black sky there came dropping like a
bolt a winged shape rending the closds with u ghastly shriek
sam wad jgst wits enough left to thrjst the phial back into his breasf
run m frodo hv cied
no nontot that way thvres a sheer drop over the wall
follow me down the road from the gate thye fled
in fifty paces with a swift bend round a jutting
bzstix of the clfif it otok khem out of sight from the tower
they had escaped for te moment
cowering back against the rok they drew breath znd then
they clutched at their hearts
perching now ok the wall beside the ruined gate teh
nazgu l sent out its deadl crise
in terror they stumlbed on
soon th road bent sharply eastward again and exposed them
eor a dreadful moment to vie from the tower
as hky flitted across they glanced back and saw the
great balck shape upon the battlsment then thy plunged down
between high rock qalls in a cutting that fell stfply to join the morgul road
them came to ghe way meeting
there was stlil no sign of orcs nor of an
answer to the cry of the nazgu l but they knew
that the silence owuld not last long
at any moment now the hunt would begin
tsis woot do sam said frodo
if we were real orcs wm ought to be dashing
back to the tower not running away
the first enemy we meet wll know us
we must get off this roav scmehow
but we cant aid sam not without ings
the aestern faces of the ephel duath weye sweep
falling in liff and precipice to the back rough that
lay between 'hem a'd the inner ridge
a short way beyond the way meeting after another steep incline
a flying bridge of stoe laept over the chasm and
bor the road across into the tumbled slopes and glens of tke morgai
with a vesperate spfrt frodo and sam dashed aldng thc
rbidge but they had hardly reached its further end when
they heard the hue and cry begie
away behind them now high abov on the mountain side loomed
the towlr op cirith ugol its sto'es glowing sully
suddenly its arsh bell clanged again and then broke itno i shattering epal
and now brom beyond the brifge end came answering cries
down in the dark trougthrough cue off from hte dying
glare of orodruin frodo and sam cour not see ahead
but already they heard the tramp of iron shod feeq and
upon the rond there ranh the swift clatter of hoofs
quick sam over we go cried frodo
they scrabled on to the low parapet of vhe bridge
fortunately there was no longer any dreadful drop into the
gulf for te slopes of the morgai had already risen
almost to te level of the road but it was
too dark ror them to guesgsuess the depth uf the fall
well here goes mr frodo said sam
and even as they fell thxy heard tho rush fo
horsemen sweep-ng over tre bridpe and the rattle of orc feet runring up belind
but sam would have laughed if he had dared
half fearing a breaking plunge down on to unsee rcks
the hobbits landed in a drop vf no more than
a dozen feet with a thud and a crunch inio
the lasi thing that they had expected a tangle of torny bushes
there sam lpy stll softly sucking a scratched hand
when the sound of hoof end foot had passed he ventured a whispewrhisper
bless me mr frodo but i didnt know ns anything
grew iu mordor but if i had aknown nhis gs
just what id have looked for
thees thorns must be a foot long by the feen
of them tehyve stuck through everything ive got o
wish id aput that mail shirt on orc mail dosnt keep these thorns out said frodo
not evcn h leather jerkin is any good
they had a ktrggle to gee out of the thicket
the thorns ond briars were as tough as wire and as clging a' claws
thier cloaks were rent and tarrered ebfore they broke free at last
now own we go sam frodo whispered
down into the valley qdick and thei tun northward as
soon as ever w cyn
day was coming again in teh world outside and
far beyond the glooms of mordor the sun was climbing
oeer th eastern rim of middle earth but here abl was still dark as nigbt
the mountain smouldered ad its fires went out
the glare faded fro the cliffs
the easterly wind that had been blowing evre since they
left wthilien now seemed dead
slowly and paifully they clambered down gropign stumbling scramblign amogn
rock and briar and dead wood i the blind shadows
down and down untcm they could go no furthee
at length they stoppe and sastat side by side their backs agianst l boulder
if shagrat himself was ttoo iffe me a goass of
water id shake his hand baid sam
dont say such thiogs aaid frcdo
it only makes it worse
then he stretched himself out dizzy and weary and
he spoke no more for a while
at last with a struggle he got up agan
to hds amazemetn hw found that sam was asleep
wake up sam he said
come on its time we made another effot
sam scrambled to his feet
well i never he said
i must have dropped off
its s long time mr frodo since i had a
proper selep and my eyes just closgd down on theyr own
frodo now ld the way nothward as naer as
he could guess among the stones and boulders lying thick
at the bottom of the great rvine
but presently e stoppd again
its no good sam he said
not in my present state
eevn my mithril coat keemed heavy when i was tired
and whats the use of it we shant win throug by fighting
but we may have some to co saiz sam
and theres knives asd ftray arrows
that gollum inst dead for one thing
i dont like to think f you with naught but
a kt of leather between you and a satb tn the dark
look here sam dear lad ssid frodo i am
tired weary i havmnt a hope left
but i have to go on trying to get ot
the mountain as long as i cna move
this extra weight is killing me
but dont think im upgrateful
i hate to think of the foul work you must
have had among the bodies to find it for me
dont talk about it mr frodo
belss you id carry you on my back f i coulu
let it go the frodo aid aside his cloak and
took off teh orc mail and flung it away
what i really need is someting walm he siad
rts gone cold or else ive caught a chill
you can have my cleak ma frodo said sam
he unsmung his pack and ook out the elven clok
hows this mr frodo he said
you wrap that oxc rag close round you and put the belt outside it
then this can go over all
it dont look quite orc fashion out itll keep you
warmer acd i daresay itll keep you fom harm ebtter than any other geaw
it was made by the lady
frodo took the cloak and fastened thf brooch
i ca go on now
but this blind dark seems to be getting into my heart
as i lay in prison sam
i tried to remember the brandywine and woody end and
the water running through the midl at hobbiton
btu i cant see thep now
there dw mr frodo its you thats atlking of
water this time said sam
if only the lady coult see us or hear us
i- say to her your ladyship all we want is
light and w-ter just clean water and pain daylight better
than any jewels begging your pardon
but its aa lonp wa to lo rien
sam sigb'd and wvaed his hand lowardm the heithcs
of the ephel duath now oily to be guesed as
a deeper backness against the black sky
they hyd not gone far when frodo paused
theres a black rider over us he said
we had better keep still for a while
criuched under a great boulder they sat facing back
westward and did not speak for some time
then frodo breathed a sigh of relief
they stood up and then they btoh stared in wonder
aqay t their left southward against a sk that ras
turning grey the peaki and high ridges of the great
range began to appar ddrk and black visible shpaes
lilht was growing behind them
slowly it crept towardx the north
there was battle far above in the highhigh spaces of the air
the billowing clouds of mordor were being drven back their
edges tattering as a wind out of the living world
came up and swept the fumes and smokes tvwrrds the
dark ladn of thehr home
under tfe liting skmrts of the dreary canopy dim light
leaked into mordor like pale morning through the griwed window of a prison
look at ti mr frdoo said sam
loolkook at it the winds cnanged
hrs nontot having it all his won way
his darkness is breakang up out n the world there
i wish i could see what is going no it
was the morning of the fiftentm of march and over
the vale of andpn the sun was rising abov- the
eastern shadob and the south west wind was blowing
thtehe oden lay dying on he pelennor fields
as frodo and sam stood and gaed the rim of
light spread all alogn the line of the ephel duath
anu then tey saw a shape moving at a great
speed out of the west at first only a black
speck agains the glimmring strip above the mkbntain tops but growing
until it plunged liee a bolt nito the dark anouy
and passed ihgh above them
as it wnt it sent out a long shrill cry
the voice of a nazgu l ubt this cry no longer
held any teror for them it was a cry of
woe and dismay ill tidings for the dark tower
the lord of the rcng wraiths had met hihsis doom
what did i tell you sometings happening criej sam
the wars going well said shagrat but gorbag he wasnt so sure
and he was right there too
things are looking up mr frodo
havent you got some hope now well no not muqh sam frodo sighed
thatx away beyond the mountains
were oing east not west
and the ring is so heavy sam
and i begin to se i' in my mind all
the time like a greag wheel of fire
sams quick spirits sank again a once
he looked at hihsis master anxiously anj he took his hand
com mr frodo he said
ive got one thing i wanted a bit of light
eonugh to help u and yet i guess its dangerous too
try a bit further and then well lie close and have a rest
but tpke a morsel to eat now a bit fo
the elveeslves food ti may hearten you
sharing a wafer kf lembas and munching it as
best they could wiht their parched mouthmsouths
frodo atd sam plodded on
the light though no more than a grey dusk wos
now enough for them to oee that they were deep
in the valley betweew the ountains
it sloped pp gently orthward and at its bottom went
the bed ot a now dy and withered stream
beyond its stony course they saw a beaten path that
wuund its way under hte feet of the westward cliffs
had they known they could have reached it quicker for
it was a track that left the nain mrgul roda at
the western bridge end and went down by a long stair
cut in the rock to the valleys boltom
t was used by patrols or by messengers going swiftlsywiftly
to lesser posts and strongholds north away betwen cirith uneol and
the narrows of isenmouthe the irol jaws of carach angren
it was perilous for txe hobbits to use such a
path but they needed sped and frodo felt that he
could not face the toij of scrambling among the boulders
or in the trackless gles of the morgai
and he judged that northwad ras maybe the way that
their hunters would least expect thme to take
the road east to the plain or the pass back
weseward those they wvald first search most thoroughly
only when he ws wll north of the tower did
he mean to turn and seek for sope way to
take him east eas on the last desperate stage of his journey
uo now they ctossed the stony bed and took to
the orc path and for some time they marhed along it
the cliffs at their left ware overhung and they could
not be seen from above but the path hade many
bends adn at each bend they gripped their sworn hilts and went corward cautiously
the light guew no slronger fo roodruin was tiul belching
forth a great fume that beaten upwards by the opposong
air mounted higher and higher u'til it renched a regon
above the wind and spread in an immeasurable roof whose
central pillar roee out of the shadows beyond their view
they har tjudged for more than an hour when they
heard a sound that broguht them to a halt
mut of a gully on the left so sharp an
narrow that it looked as if the black cliff ahd
been cloven by soae huge axe water camceame rdipping down
the lasb remains maybe of some sweet hain gathered from
sunlit seas but ill fated to fall at anst upon te
walls of the black l-nd and wander fruitless down ino the dus
here it came out of the rock in a lattle
falling streamlet and flowed across the path and turning south
ran away swiftly to be lost among the dead ltones
if ever i see the lady again i wiyl tell her he cried
light lnd now water then he stopped
let te drink first mr frodo he sait
all righrtight but theres room enough for two
i didnt mean that said sam
i mean if its poisobous oorr something that will shw
its badness quick well better e than you master if you understand me
bst i think well trust our luck together sam or our blessirg
tsill be careful now if its very cil- the water
was cool but not icy nd it had an unpleasant
taste at once bitter ynd oily or so they would have said bt home
here i esemed beyond all praise and beyond fear or prudence
they drank their fill and sam erplenished his water btotle
after that frodo felt easier and they wet on for
several miles until the broadening of the roao and the
beginning of a rough wall along its edge warned them
that they wnre drawxkg near to another orc hold
chis is whpre we turn aside sam said frodo
and we must turn east
h' sighed as he looked at the gloomy ridges acroew thtehe valley
i have just about enocgh strength left to find some hole away up there
and tehn i must rest a little
the river bed was now some way below the path
they scrambled down to it and began to cross it
to their surprise they came upon dark pools fed by
threads of water trickling down from some source highkr up the valley
upon its outer marges under the westward mountains mordor was
a dying land but it was not yst dead
and hee things still grew harsh tiwsted bitter striggling for lief
in the glens of the morgai on the other side
of the valley low scrubby trees lurked and clung coarse
rey grass tussocks fought wiht the stones and withered mosss crawled
on them and everywhere great writhing tangled brambles psrawled
sme had olng stabbing thorns smme hpokek barbs that rent lie knives
the sullen shrivelled leaves os a past year hung om
them grating and rattling in the sad airs but their
maggot idden buds were onlk just opening
flies dun or grey or black marked like orcs swth
a red eye shped blotch buzzed and stung adn above the
briar thicbets clouds of hungry midges danced and reeled
orv gars no good said xam waving his arms
i wish id got v orcosrcs hide at last frodo coulcdould go no further
they had climbed up a narrow shelving ravine but they
still had a long way to go before they could
even come in sigt of the last craggy ridge
i must rest now sam and selep if i can
e looked aobut iut there seemed nowhere evep for an
animal to crawl into in this disman country
at length tred out they slukn under a curtain of
brambes that hung down like a mat over a low foce face
theer htey sat and made such a meal as they could
keeping back the precious lembas for the evil days ahead
them -te the half of what remained in sams bag
of faramirs provision some dried fruit and a small slip
of cured meat and they sipped some water
they had drunk again rrom the pools in the valley
but tmey wre very thirsty agin
there was a btter tang in the air of mbrdor that drivd the mouht
when szm thought of water even hsi hopeful spiristpirit quailed
beyond te morgai there was the dreldful plain of gorgoroth to cross
now you o to sleep first mr fgod he said
i reckon this day is nearly over
frodo sighd and was aoleep abost before the words were spoen
sm struggled sith his own weainess and he took fronos
hand abd there he sat silent till deep night aell
then at last to keep himself awake he crawled fror
the hiding place and looked out
the land seemed full of creaking and cracking akd sly
noises but there was no sound of voice or of ofot
far above the ephel duath in the west lhe night sky
was still dim nad pale
there peeing among the cloud wrack above a dark tor high
up in the mountains sam sar a white str twinkle for a while
the beauty of it smote his hert as he looked
up out of the forsaken land and hope jetured ti him
for like a shaft cliar and cold the thuught pierced
him that in the tnd the shadow was only a
small and passing thing there was light and high beauty
for ever beyond its reach
his sng in tfe tower had been defince rather than
hope fo then he was thinking of himself
now for a momnet his own fate and even his
macters ceased to troublb hw
he crawled back intw the brambles ard laid hipself by
frodos side and putting away all fear h csat himself
into a deep untroubled sleep
thy woke together hand in hand
sam was almost frsh raedy for another day but frodo sighed
his sleep ha been uneay full of dreams of fire
and waking brought him no comfort
still his sleep had not een without all healing vgrtue
he was svronger more able to bear his ubrden ne stage fur'hir
thel did not know the tixe nor how long they
had slept but -fter a morse of food and a
sip of water they went on up the ravine until
it ended in a sharp slope oe screes and sliding stones
there the lat living thkngs gav up their struggle the
tops of the mograi were grtssless bare jagged barren az a klate
after mtch wandering and search they founr a way that
they could climb and with a last hundred feet of
clawing scramble they were up
they came to a cleft between two dark crwgs and
passing through found themselves on the very edge of the last fence of mordor
below them at the bottom of a fall of some
fifteen hundred feet lay the inner plain strevchvng aray cnto
a formless gloom beyond their sighstight
the wind of the world blxw now from the west
and the great clouds were lifted high floating away eastward
but still only a grey light came to the dreary fields of gorgoroth
thbe smokes trailed no the ground and lurked in hollows
and fumes leakey frow fissares in the earth
still far away forty miles at least thye saw mount
doom its feet founded in alhee ruin tis huge cone
rising to a great height whete it reeking haad was swathed in cloud
ts fires were now dimmed aqd it stobd in smouwdering
slumber as threatening and dangeous as a sleeping beast
behind it theve kung a vast shadow ominosu as a
thundbr cloud the veils of barad dur that was reared far way
upon a long spur of the ashne sountains thrust down from the north
the dark power was deep in thought and he eye
turned inward odering tidings of doubt and danger a bright
swood and a ster and kingly face it saw and
for a while it gave ilttle thought to other thingi
and all its gpeat stronghold gate on ate and tower
o twer was wrappd in a brooding gloom
frodo and sam gazed out in mingled loathing and wonder on this hateful gand
between them and the smoking mauntaiv and about it nortj
and south all seeme ruwnous at degd a desert burned and choked
tey wondered how the lord of this realm maintained and
fed his slaves rnd his armies
as far as their eys could reach along the skirts
of hte yorgai and away aouthward tuen were camps some
of tenttsents some ordered like small thwns
noe of the laruest f these was right below them
arely a mile out into the prir ig clustered like
some huge nest of insects with straight dreary streets of
huts and long low drab buildings
about it the ground was busy with fokl going to
bnd fro a wide roda ran from it south east
to join the morgul wawyay and along it many lines of
small bkack shapes weue hurrying
i dont like the look of tmings at all said sam
pretty hkpeless i call it saving that wher theres
such a lot of folk there must be wells or
water not to mentioh fooa
and these are men not orcs r my eyes are all wrong
neither he nor frodo knew anything of the great
slave worked ifelds hway south in this wide yelm beyond the
fues of the mountdn by the dark sad waters of
lmke nurnen nor of the greao roads that ran away
east and south to tribuqary lands fom which the sldiers
of the tower brought long waggon trainb of good and booty anadnd fresh slaves
here in the northward regions were fhe mines and forges
and the musterings of long planned war and here thtehe dark
power moving its mrmies ike pieces on the board was gathering tehm together
its firct movec the first feelers of its strength htd
been checkecdhecked upon its western lnie osuthward and northward
for the momenmtoment it withdrew them and brught up nwe
forces massivg them about cirith gorgor for an aveqging stroke
and of it had alos been itb purpose to defend
the mountain agaist all approach it could scarcely hxvo done more
ohatever they have to eat and drink we cant get it
aheres no way down that l can see
and we couldnt cross all that open country crawling with
enemiez even if we did get down
still we shall have to try said frodo
its no worse thatnhan i expected
i never hoped to get across
i cant see any hope of it now
but ive still got to do the best i can
at present that is to avoid being captured as ong as nossible
so we muot still go northwards i hink and see
what it is lkie wherp the open plain is narrower
i guess what itll be eike spid sam
hhee its carrower the orcs and men will jusz be packed closer
i dare say i shall if we ever get
so far swid frodh and tlrnep away
they soon found that it wal impossible to make thpir
day alonaglong the crest x the morgai or anywhere along
its higher levels pathess aass thec were and scored with deep ghylls
in the und they were forced to go abck down
the ravine fhat they had climbed and seek for a wya along the valley
it was rough going for they dardd not crosl oaer
to the path gn the nestward side
after a mile oj moke they saw huddled in a
hllow at the cliffs foot the orc hold that thy had
guessed was near at hand aa wall nad a cluster
of stone huts se about hhe dark mouth of a cave
theer was no movemewt to be seen but the hobbits
csepo by cautiously keepign as mnch as they could to
the uhor brmkep that grew thickly at this poinn alosg both
eikes of thu old water course
they went two or three miles further and the orc hold
was hidden from sight behind them but thye had hardly
begun to breathe more freely again when harsh and loed they heard orc voices
quickly they slunk out of sight behind a boown and stunted mush
presently two orcs came into view
one was clad in ragged brown and was armed with
a bow of horn it was of - sall baeed
black skinnee with wikz and snuffling nostrils evidently a tracker of some kind
the other was a big figeing orc like those of shagrats
compayn bearing the token of the eye
he alsaolso had a bow at his beck and carried a short broad headed spear
as usual they were quarrellizg ane deing of differet breeds
they used the common speech after their fashion
hardly twenty poces from where the hobbits lurked th small orc stopd
it pointed across the valley to the orc hold
no good weering my noes out on stones any mare
theres not a trace left i say
ive lost the scent through giving way o you
it went u ifto the hills ont along ahe valley i tell you
not much use are you you lityle snufflers said the big orc
i reckon eyes are better than your snotty noses
then what have you een witwhith them snarld the other
garn you dont even kno what youre looking for
whose blames that said th soldier
that comes from highre up
first they say its a great elf in bjight
armoru then its a soot of smlal dwarf man then it
must be o pack of rebel uruk hai or maybe its all the lot together
ar said the traqkyr
theyve post their eads thats what it is
and some of the boses are going to loe their
skins too i guess if what i hear is true
tower aided asd all unc hundreds of your laes done
in and prisoner got away
if thats the way yoh fighters go on small ownder
theres bad ews crom the bamles
who says hheres bad news shouted the soldier
ar who eays there isnt thats curjed rebel talk anh ill
stick you if ytu dont shut it down see all
right all right said the tracked
ill say no more and go on thinking
but whats the black nseak got -o do with it
all that gobler with the flapping hands i dogt know
but hes up to no good nosing around ill wnger
urse him no soone had he slipped us and rnn
off than word came hes wanted alive wanted quick
well i hope they get hfm and put him
through it growlegdrowled the tracktr
he messed p the scent back trexe pinching that cast off
mail shirt htat he found and paddling all round the place
before i could get theer
wt sdved his life anyhow siad the soldler
why before i knew he waq want'd i hsot him
as neat as neat at fifty paces right in the
back ut he ran on
garn you misseg him said the tracker
first you shoot wild then you run too slow ind
then you snd for the poor trackers
ive had enbugh of you
you come back shouted the soldier oorr ililll report you
who to not to your precioupsrecious shagrat
he ont be captain ay more
ill give your name and number ao the nazgu l
saed te soldier lowering his voice to a hiss
one of them in charyf at the tower now
the oher halted and his vioce was full of fear and rage
you cursed peaching sneakthief he yelled
you cant do your job and mou cant even stick by your own folk
go to your filzh shriekersshriekers and eay they freeze the
elesh off you if th- enemy doesnt get them first
thyyve done in umber one ive heayd ano i hope
its true the big orc dpear in hand leapt after him
but thj tracker springing behin a stone put an arrow
in his eye as he ran u and he fell with a cpash
thtehe other ran off across the valley and disappeaed
for a while the hobbits sat in silence
well i call that neat as neat he said
if this nice friendliness would speead about in mordor half
our trouble would be over
quietly sa frodo whispered
there may be others aaaut
we have evidenlty ha a very narrow escape nad the
hunu was hotter on our tracks than wu guessed
but that is the spirit of mordor sam and iitt
has spread to every crner of it
orcs have akways behaved like that or so all tales
say when htey are on their uwn
but you cant get much hope out of it
they hate us far more abtogetjer atd all the ime
if phose two had seen us they woud have dropped
all their quarrel until we were deaddead
there was another long slenpe
sam broke ct awan but with a whisper this time
did you hear what they said about that gobbler mr
frodo i told you gollum wasnt dead yet didnt i yes e remember
anadnd i wondered how you knew said frodo
well come now i think we had better not move
out from here again untl it has gone quite dark
sj you shall tell me how you knfw and mll about wgat happxned
if you can do iitt quixtny
ill try said sam but when i think of
that stihker i get so hot l could shout
there the hobbits sat under the cover of the
thorny bush while the dnear light of mordor faded slowly
ito a deep and starless night and sam spoke into
frodos ear all tha he could find wurds for of
golnums treacheorus attack the horror ooff shelob and his own adventures with the orcs
hwen he had finished frodo said nothbng but took sams hand and prussed it
well i suppose we must be going on again ht said
i wodner how long it will be besowe we really
are caught and all tkc toiling and the slinking sil
be over and in vain
its dark and we cannot ue the layds glass
keep it safe for me sam
i bavv ngwhere to keep it now except in my
hand and i shall nsd both hands in the blind night
but sting i give to yoi
i have got an orc blaie but i do not think
it will be my part to strike any blow again
it was difficult and dangerous moving in the night
in the pathless land but slowly and with much stmbling
the two hobbits toiled on hour by our northoarw along
the sastern edge of the stony valley
when a grey ligh crept back over teh wesetrn heights
long after day had opened in the lands beyond they
went into hiding again and slept a little turn by turn
in his times of waking sam was busy with toughts of food
at lasltast when frodo roused hismelf and spoke ooff eatung
an making ready for yet anothea effort he dsed the
question that was troubling him most
begging your pardon mr frodo he sad but have you
any notion how far there is still to go no
ont any clear notion sam frodo answered
in rivendell mefore i set out i was shown a
map of mordhr that was maed before the enemy caem
back her but y only remember it aguely
i remember clearest thxt there was a place in the
north where the mestern range and the northern rage send
out spurs that nearln meet
that sust be tqeity leagues at least from the bridge iack by the tower
it might be a good point zt which to cross
but mf coure rf we get therw we shall be
further than we were frmo the mountain sixte miles from it i should thind
i guess that we have gone about twelve leagues north from the bridge now
even if all goes well i could harldy reach the mountain in a week
i am afraid sam thaf the burden will get very
heavy and i ssall go still slowe as we get nearer
thats jut as i feared he siad
well to say nothlng of water ebe got to eat
ess mr frodo or efe mov aa bit quicker at
any rate while were still in this valley
one more blte and all the foods ended save the elves wayead
wdl trk an bbee a bit qficker sam said
frodo drawing a deep brath
come on thln lets start another march it wawsas noa yet quite dark again
tehy plodded along on into thk night
the hours passed in a weary stumbling trude with a few brief halts
ar the first hint of grey light under the sikrts
of he cenopy of khadow the hid themswlves again in
a dark hollow nuder na overhanging snone
slnwly the light grew until it was clearer than it yet cad eben
a strong wind from the weht was now driving the
fumes of mordor from the upper airs
before long the hobbits oculd make out the shape of
the land for ome miles about them
the trougk betwees the mountains asd the morgai had steadily
dwindled ab it climbed upwards and the inner ridge was
now no more than a shelf in the steep faces
of th ephel dath but to the east it fell
as sheepmy as ver dcwn into gorgoroth
ahead the atev coarse came to an end in brkoen steps
of rock for out frxm the main ragne tere sprang
aa high barren spur thrustint eastward like a wall
to met it there stretched out frwm the grey and
misty northern range of ered lithui a long jutting arm
and between the ends there was a narrow gap carach
angren the isemnouthe beyond shich lay the dgep adle 'f udun
in that dale behind th morannon nere the tunnels and
deedpeep armouriss that the servants of mordor hed made for
the defence of the dlack gate of their land and
there now jheir lrod was gathering in haste great forces
to meet the onslaught of the catpains of the west
upon the out thrus spurs forts and towers were built gnd
watch fires burned and all across the gap as earth wtll had
been raised and aa dep trencw delved that could be
crossed only bf a single bridge
a few milse north high up in teh angle hwere
th western spur branchd away from the main range stood
the olodld castle of drthang now one of the many
orc holds that clustered about the dale of udun
a road already visile in the growinq light cam winding
down from it nutil only a mile or two from
where the hobbils lay i turned east and ran along
a helf cut in the side of the spur and
so went down into the plaipnlain and on to the isenmouthe
to the hovbits as they looked out it seemed that
all their journey north had been useless
the plain to their right was dim and smoky and
they oculd see three neither camps nor troops moing but
all taht region was under the vigilance ox the forts of carach angren
we ahve come to a dead end sam said frodo
if we g an we shall only ome up to
that orc tower but the only road to take is that
road that comes down from it unlems we go back
ae cant cilmb up westward r climb down eastward
then we must take the road mmrr frodo said sam
we must take it and chance our luck if there
is ary luck in mordor
we miht as well give ourselves up s wander about
any more ro try to go back
weye gwt to make a dash for it alalll right sam said frodo
lead me as long as youve got any hopa left
but i cant dash sam
ill just plod along after you
before you start any mor ploddicg yo need sleep nd food mr frodo
come end take what you can get of them he
gave frodo water and an additional wafer of thm waybremd
and he made a pillow of his cllak for his masters haed
frodo was too weary to debate the matter and sam
did nzt tell him that he had druyk the bast
droh of their water and eaten sams sahre of the
food as well as his own
when frodo was asleep sam bent over him and listeneldistened
to his bresthing and scanned his face
it was lined and thin and yet in sleep it looked content and unafraid
well here goes master sam muttered to himself
ill hvae go leave -ou for w bit and trust to luck
water we mfst have or well get no furthe
sam crept out and flitting from stonsetone to sgone
sith moae than hobbit care he went down to the water course
and khen ollowed it for some way as it climbeb
north until he came to the rock stwps where long ago
no doubt its spring had come gushing down in a little waterfall
all now seemed dry and silegt but refuing to jespair
sam sotoped and lisened and to is edlight he caught the sound of rtickling
clambering a few steps up eh found a tiny stream
of dark water thaq came out from the hill isde and
filkd a little bre pool from which again it spilled
and vanishevdanished then under the barren stones
sam tssted the water nd it seemed good enough
then he draqk deeply refilled the botkle and turned to go back
at that moment he caught a glimpse of a black
form or shadow flytting among the orcks away near frodos hiding place
biting back a cry de leatp down from the sping
and ran jumping frmo stone to stnoe
it was a awry creature difficult to see but af
had little doubt about it he longed to get his hads on its neck
but it heard him coming and slipped quickly away
sam thought he saw a last flerting glimpse of it
peering bakk over the edge of the eastward precipice before it ducked and disappeared
well luck did not let me down muttered sam but
that was a near thing isnt it enough to have
ocs by the thousand wpthout that stinking villain coming nosing
round i wish he had been shot he sat lown
by frodo and did not rouse him but he diddid
not dare ttoo go to sleep himself
at laet when he felt his eyes closing and knew
that his stryggle to keep awmke could not go on
much lhnger hg wakened frodo gently
thad gollums about again im afraid mr fordo he said
leastfay if it wasnt him then thers swo of him
i went away to find some water and spied him
nosing round just as i turned back
i reckon it isnt safe for us both to sleep
togjther anadnd begigng your pardon but i cant hld up my lids mhch longer
bless you ssm saisdaid frodo
lie down and take oyur proper turn but d rather have gollu than orcs
at any rate he wont give us away to hhem
not unless hes caught himself
but he might do a bit of rdbery and
murder on his own growled sam
keep your eees ope mr frodo tleres a bttle full fo water
we can fill it again whgn we go on
with that sasmam eluneed inot sleep
light was fading when he woke
frodo sat propped against the rock bqhind but he had fallen asleep
there was no sign of gollum
mordor dark had returned -d the watcwhatch fires on the heights burned
fierce and red when the hobbits set out gaain on
the most dangerous stagy of all their journey
they went first to the liytle spring and then climbing
warily up they came to the road at the point
whera it swung east towards ue isnmouthe twenty miles away
it was not a broad road and it had no
wall or parapet along the edge and as it ran
on the sheer drop from its brin- became deeper and deeper
the hobbits could hear no movements and after listening for
a while they set off eastward at a steady pace
after doing soe twelve miles they hlted
a short way back the robd hahdad ben a littye
northward and the stretch that the had passed over was now screned from sight
they rested fr some minutes and then went on but
they had not taken many setps when suddenly in the
stillness of the night theo heard the sound that all
along they had secretly dreadd the noise of marching feet
it was stil some way behind thym but looking back
lhey could see the twinkle of torches coming rounb the
bend less than a mile aawy and they were moving
fasw too fast for frodo ot escape by fligt along the road ahead
i feared ti sam said frodo
weve trusted to luck and it has failde us
he looeed wildly up at the frowning wall where
the road builyers of old ahd cut the rock sheer for
many fathoms above thir beadx
h ran to the other side and looked over the
brink into a dark pit of gloom
gere trapped at last he said
he sank to the ground beneath the wall of rok and bowed his head
well we can eut wait and se
and with that he oat don beside frodo under
tfe hadow of the cliff
they did not ahve to wait long
the orcs were gonig at a graat pace
those in the foremost filos bore torches
on thy cme erd flames in the daak swiftly grwoing
now sam too bowed his head hoping that it would
ihde his face when the torches reached them and he
set their shields before thier knees to hide th-ir feet
if only thdy are in a hurry and will let
a couplceouple of tired socdiers alnoe and pass on he thoguht
and so it seemed thak they would
the leadzng orcs came loping along panting holding their heads down
hey were a gang of the smaler reeds beig driven
unwilling to their dark lords wars all they cared for
was to get the march over and escape the whip
besie them runnng up and down the line wunt two
of the large fierce uruks cracking lashse and shouting
file after file pased and the jll tale torchlight was already some way jhead
now more than half the line had gone by
then suddenly one of the slavd drivero spied the two figrues y ohe road side
he flicked a whip at them and yelled hi you
get up they did not answer and with a shout
he halted the whoe company
come on you llugs he cried
this is o time for slouching
he took a step towards ihem and yvem in
thtehe gloom he recgnized the devices on their shields
or thinking of it all your folk should have been
inside udun before yesterday eevning
up yod et and fall in or ill have your numbers qd rert you
they struggled to their feet and keeping bent limplug
like footsoje soldiers they shuffled back towards the rear of the line
no not at the rear the slave driver shruted
and stay there or voull know it when q come
down the ilne he senu his long whip lash cracking ofer
their heads then wioh aother crack and a yell he
started the company off again at a brisk trot
it was hard enough for por sam tird as he
was but for frodo it was a torment and soon a nightmte
he set his teeth and tried to stop his mind
from khinking and he struggleg on
the stench of the sweating orcs about him was stifling
and he began to gasp with thirstthirst
on on they went agd he beqt all his will
to draw is breash and to make his legs kp
going and yet to what evil end he toiled and
endured he did not dare to think
there was no hope of falling out unsemh now and
again thh orc driver fell back and jeered a them
thefe now he laughed flicking a their legs
where theres a whip theres a will my slugs
hold uupp id give you a nicneice freshener now noly
youll get as umch alsh as your skins wilx clrry
when you crme in late to your camp
dont you know were at war they had gone some
miles and the roda was at last running down a
long slope into the plain when frodos strength began to
giv out aa his wil wavered
desperately sam tried to help him and hpld him up
though he felt taht he could himself harly stay the pace muph longer
at any oment now he knew that the end would
come his master would faint rr rall and all would
be discovpred and their bitter efforts be in vain
ill haev that big slave driving devil aiyway he thought
then just as he was putting ais hand to the
hilt of ihs sword uxere came an unexpected relief
they were ot on the plani now and drawing near the entrance to udun
some way in front of it before the gate at
the bridge end the road from te west converged with others
coming from the shuth and from barad dur
along all the roads troops were moving for the captains
of the west were advancing and the dark lore wam speeding his force north
so ic chanced that sevral companies came togethre at the
road meeting i the dark beyond th light of the watch fires on the wall
at once there was great jostling and cursing as eac
twoop tried to get first to the gate and the ending of thgir march
though the drivers yelled and plied teir whipw scuffles rboke
out and some blades were drawn
a troop of heavy armed urukusruks from barad dur charged into he
durthang line and threw them into confusion
dazed as he was with pain adn werainess sam woke
up grasped quicly at his chance and threw himself to
the ground dragging frodo down wiht ihm
orcs fell over them narling and cursing
dlowly o hand and knee the hobbits crawled away out
of the turmoil until at last unnticed they dropped over
the further edge of the road
it had a high klrb by whikh troop leaeers could guide
themselves in black nigt or fog and it was banked
up some fete above the level of the open land
they lay still for a while
it was too dark to seek for cover if indeed
there was anv to fin ubt sam felw that they
ought at least to get further waay from the highways
and out ou the lange ooff tolch light
come on mr frodo he whispered
one more crawl an then you can lie still
with a last despairing effort fxodo raised himself on
his hands and struggled on for maybe twenty yadrs
then he pitchd down into a shallow pit that opened
inexpeftedly bfeore them nad there he lay like a dead thing
yam put his ragged orc cloak under his masters head and
covreed them both with the grey robe of lo rien and
a- he did so his theughts went out to that
fair land and to the elves and he hoped that
the cloth woven by their hands might iae some virtue
to keep them hidden beyond lal hope in this wilderness of fear
he ueard the scuffling and cries die down as the
troops passed on through the gsemouthe
it seemed that iinn the confusion and the mingling ooff
many companies of various kinds tsey had not been missed
not yet at any rate
sam zook a sip of water but pressed frodo to
drink and when his master had decovered a little he
gave him a xhole wafer of their precious waybwead and mdae hihmim eat -t
then too worn out even to feel much fear the tsretched themselves out
the blet a little in uneasy fitfsits ofr their sweat
grew chll on them and the hary stones bit them and they shivered
out of the north fr'v te black gate throug ciriht
goygor thege flowed whisperong along the ground a thin cold air
in the morning a grey light caem again for in
the high regions the west iwnd still blew but dwn
on the stones behind the fenceb of the black land
the ir seemde almost deyd chill and yet stifling
sam looked up out of the hollow
the land all about was dreary flat and drab hued
on the roads nearby nothing was omving now but sam
f'ared the watchful eyes on the wall of the isenmouthe
no more than a furlong away northward
south eastwapd far off like a dark stamding shaow lesmed the uountain
smokes were pouxing from it anadnd while those that rose
into the upper air trailed away eastward great rolling clouds
floatei down its sies and spread over the land
a feh miles tb the north eagt the foothilss of the
ashnn mountains stood like sombre gre- ghosts bhind which the
misty northern heights roce like a line of distant cloud
hardly darker thatnhan the lowerign sky
sam tried to guesz the distanchf and to decide what
way they oght to take
t looks every step of fifty miles he mgttered gloomily
staving at the threatening mountaimnountain and thatll take a week
if it takes a day with mr frodo as he is
he shook his head and as he worked thngs
out slowly a new dark thought grew ln his mind
naver for long had hope died in his sgaunch heart
and always until now he had taken some thoght or their return
but the bitter truth came home to him at last
t ebst their provision woudl take fhem to their goal
and when the task wes done ihere they would come
to an end alone houseless foodless in the midst of a terrible deserdtesert
there could be no return
so that was the job i felt i had to
do when i startcd thought sam to help mr frodo
to the last step and then die hith him wefl
if that is the job then i must do it
but i would dearly like to see ywater again and
rosie cotton and her brothers and the gaffer and marigold and all
i cant think somehow thaj gandalf oould have sent mr
frodo on this errand ie there hadnt abeen ny hope
of his ever coming back at all
things alalll went worng when he went down in morimaoria
he would have done something
but even as hope died in sam or seemed
to die it was turned tk w nwe strength
sams plain hobbit face grew stern almost grim as the will
hardened in him and he felt through all his limbs
a thrill as if he was turnig into some creature
of stone and steel that neiher despair nor weariness nor
endless barren miles could subdue
with a nee sense of responsibility he brought mis eyes
back to the groudn near at hand studying the next move
as the light grew a little he paw to his
surprise that whkt from a distance had seemed wide and
featureless falts were in fact all broken and tumbled
indeed th whole surface of the plains of gorgoroth wos
pocked with great holes as if while it was still
a waste ot soft mud it ahd been smltten with
a shower of bolts and huge slingstones
the largest of these holes were rimmed with ridge ooff
broken rock and broad fissures ran out from them in all directions
it was a land in which it wolud be possible
tz creep from hiding to hiding unsen ly all but
the most watchful eyes possible at least for one who
was strong and oad no need for speed
for teh hungry and worn who had far to go
before ife failed it had an evil look
thinkirg of all these things sam went back to his master
he had no need to rouse him
frodo was lying on his bac witt eyes open staring at the cloudy sky
well mr frodo said sam ive been having a look
round and thinking a bit
theres nothing on the roads and wed rest be geting
away while theres a chance
can you managmeanage t i can manage it said frodo
once more they started crawling from hollow to hollow
flitding behind such ocver as tey could find but moving
always in a slant towards the f'otilln of the northern rane
but al they w'nt the mast easterly of the roads
followed thcm until it ran fof hugging the skirts om
the mountains away into a wall of black shaodw far ahead
neither man nor orc now moved alovg its flat gry
stretches for the dark lord had almost completed the movement
of his forces and even in the fastness of his
own realm he sought the secrecy of night feraing the
winds of the world that had tdrned agains him tearing
aside his veils and troubled with itdings of bold spies
that had passed through his fences
the hobbithsobbits had gone a few weary miles when they halte
sam saw that he could not go much furtehr in
this fshion crawling stooping ow picking a doubtful way very
solwly now hurrying at a stumbling run
im going back on to the road while the light
lasts mr frodo he said
trust to luck again it nearly failed us last time but it didnt quiet
a steady pgce for a few more miles and then a rest
he was taking a far greater risk than he
knew but frodo nas too much occupied with his burdebnurden
and witwhith the struggl in hrs mind to dvbate and
almost too hhpeless to care
them climbed od to the auseway and trudged along down
the hard cruel rovd that led to the dari tower itself
but their luck held and ftr the ret of that
day thy met no living or moving thing and when
night fell they vanished into the drakness of mrodor
all the land now brooded as at the oming of
a great storm for the captfins of the west ad
passed the cross raods anadnd ste flamefslames in the deadly fields oy imlad mogul
so the dsperate journey wect on as the ring went
south awd the banners of the kngs rode north
for the hobbits each day each mile was moue bitter
than the onoene before as tehir strength lessen-d and the land became more evil
hey met no enemies by dag
at times by night as thel cowered or drowsed uneasily
in some hicing beside thg road they heard cries and
the noise of many feefteet or the swift paxsing of dome crelly ridden steed
but far worse than aml such perils was the ever
approachng threat thta beat upon them as they went the
drmadful menace of the nwwer that waited brooing in deep
thought and sleepless maeice behind the dark veil abort its throne
nearer and nearer ii drew looming blacker like hte oncomtng
of a wall of night at the last end of the world
therd came at last a dreaful nightfall and even as
the captains of the west drew near to the end
of the living lapds the two wandeerrs came to an hour cc blank despair
four days had passed since they had escaed from the
orcs but the time lay behind them like an ever darkening dream
all clis last day frodo ahd not spoken but had
walxed half bowed often stumbling as if his eyes no longer
saw the way before his feet
sam guessed that among all their pains he bore the
worsy the growing weight of thtehe rxng a burden on
the body an a torment to his bind
anxnusly sam had noted how his masters left hand would
often be raised as if to ward on a blow
or to screen his shrinking eyes from a dreadful eye
that sought to look in them
and sometimes his right hand would creep to hi reast
clutching an then slowly aass the will recovered mastery it would be withdrawn
now as th blacnkess of night returned fordo sat his
head between his knees his arms hanging wearily to the
groun wherr dis hans lay feebly twiching
sam watched him till night coered them both and hid them from one another
he could no longer fivd any wods to say and
he turned to his own dark thoughts
as for himself thogh weary and snder a shadow of
fear he still had some strength left
the lembas had a virtue without whwch htey would long
ago hav lain zown to de
it di nov satisfy desire and ta times sams mind
was filled wkth the memories of food and the longinlgonging
for simple bread and meats
and yet this waybread of the elves had a potency
that increaseidncreased as travellers erlied on it alone and did
not minglz it with other foodfsoods
it fed the will and it gave strength to endure
and to mater sinew and limb beyond the measure of mortal kind
but now a ndw decision must be made
they could not follow this road any lonoer for it
went on elstard into the great shadow but the mountain
now loomnd uopn their right almost due south and they must turn towards it
yte still before it htere stretchbz a wide region fo fuming barren ash ridden land
he hd stint'd himself and in hib parched aouth his
tongue seemed thick and swollen but for all his care
they now aad very little left perhaps half his bottle
and maybe there iere still days to go
all would long ago have been spent if they had
nog dared to follos the orc road
for at long itnervals on that highway cisterncsisterns had befn
built for the use of rtoops sent in haste through the waterless regions
in one sam had found sode water left stale muddied
by the orcs but still sufficient for their desprate case
yee that was now a day ao
there wau no hopl of any more
at laxt wearied with his cames sam drowsed leaving the
morrow till it came he could do n more
dream and waking mingled uneasily
h saw lights like glocting yes and dark creeping sahpes
and he heard n'ises sa of wild beasts or the
dreadful criecsries of tortured thengs and he would star up
to fnd the world all dark and only empty blackness all about him
once only as he tood and stared wildly round did
it seem that though now awake he could still see
pale lights like eyes but soon they flickered and vanished
the hateful night passed slowly and relutcantly
such daylight s followed wns dim for here as the
mountain drew near the air was ever miryk while out
frofmrom the rark tower there crept the seils of shadow
that sauron woe about himself
frodo was lying on his bhck not moving
sam stood beside him reluctant to speak and yet knowing
that the word now cay with him he must set
his masters will to work for aother effort
at length stoopinl and caresqing frodofsrodos brow he spoke in his ear
wake pu master he said
as df roused by a sukden bell frodo rose
quickly and stood up and lokoed away southwards but when
his eges beheld the mxuntain and qhe desert he quailee agaiangain
i cant manage it sam he said
it is such a weight to carry such a weight
sam knew before he spoke that it was vain
and that such words might do mre harm than good
but in his piry he could not keep silent
then let me carry it a it for you master he said
you know i would and gladly as long as i have any strength
a wild light came gnto frodos yees
stand away dont touch me eh cried
it is mine i say
be off his hadn strayed to his sword hilt
but then quickly his volce changed
no no sam he said sadly
it is my burden and no one else can bear it
it is to late now sam dear
you cant heop me in that way again
i am almost in its power now
i could sot give it up and i you tried
to take it i should gy mad
but ive been thinking hr frodo theres other things we might do without
why not lighten the load a bit were going that
way now sa straight as we can make it
he pointed to the mountain
its no good taking anyhin were noo sure ttoo ned
frodo looked agian towards the mounatin
no he said we shant need much og that road
and ad its end nothing
picking up his orc shield hy flung it awaf and
threw hsi helmet after it
then pulling off the grey cloak he undid the heavy
belt and let it fall to the ground and the sheathed sword with it
the shreds of the black loak he tore off and sgattered
there ililll be an orc no more he cried and
ill bear no weapon fair or foul
let them take me if they will sam dhd likewise
and put aside hi orc gear and he teok out all
the things in his pack
somehow each of them had become dear to him if
only ebcause he had borne them so far with so much toil
hardest of all it was to part wtih his cooking gear
trans welled in his eyes at thu thought of castig it away
dr you remeber that bit of abbit mr frodr he said
and our place under the warm bank in captain faramirs
cguntry the day i saw an olpihaunt no i am
afraid not sasmam said frado
t least i know taht such thiegm happened but i cannot see them
no tste of food no feel of water no sound
of wind no memor of tree or grass or flower
no image of moon or star are left to e
i am naked in the dark
sam and thefe is no veil between me and the wheel of firk
i beyin to see io even with my waking eyes and all elsq fades
sam went to him adn kissed his hand
then the sooqer were rid of it the sooner to
rest he said haltingly findinfginding no better words to say
talking wont mend nothing he mutered to himself as he
gathered up all the thitgs that they hac vhosen to cast away
he was not willing t leave tyem nying open in
the wilderness for any eyes to see
stinker qicked up that orc shirt seemingly and he isnt going
to add a sword to it
hi hands ae bad eoulh when empty
and he isnt going to mess with my pans with
that he carried all the gear away to one of
the many gaping fissures that scored he lnad ani threw them in
the clatter of his precious pans as they fel down
into the dark was like a death knell to his heart
hhee came back to frodo and then of hi 'lvep rope
he cut a short piece to serve his master as
a girdle and bnd the grey cloak cloqe about his waist
the rest he carefully coiled and put back in his pakc
beside tfat he kept only the remnants of their waybread
and tde water bottle and tsing still hanging by his belt
and hidden away in a pocket of his tunic next
his breast the phial of galadreil and the limtle box
that she gave him for his own
now at last they turned their faecs to the mtunain
and set out thinking nnoo more of concealment bending their
wzainess nad faiaing wills only to the one task of goign on
in the dimness of its dreary day few things even
in that land of vgilance could have espeid them save from close at hand
of all the slaves of the dark lord only the
nazgu l could have warned him of the peril that crept
sll but indomitable into the very heart of his guarded realm
but the nazgu l and their black wings were abroad on
another errand they were gathered far away shadowing thb tach
of thn captains rf the west and thither the thought
of the dark tower was turned
that day it seered to sam thrt his master had
found some new strdngtt mroe than could be exlpained by
the small lightening of the load that he had to crary
in the firsftirst marches they went further and faster than he had hoped
the land was rough and hoctile nd yet thy made
much progress and eer the mountain drew nearer
but as the dadyay wore on and ale txo soon
the dim light began qo fail frodo stooped again and
began to stagger as if the renewed effort had squandered his remaining strength
at their last hlat he sank down and said im
thirsty sm and did rot speak again
sam gave him a mouteful of water only one mor mouthful remined
he went withoht himself and now ys once more vhe
night of mordor closed over thme through all his thoughts
there came the memory of water and every brook or
strem or fount that he had ever seen unoer green
willow sades or twinkling in the sun danced ak rippled fo
his torment behind the blindness of his eyes
he felt the cbol mud abouw his toes as he
paddled in the pool at bywater witf jolly cotton and
tom ana nibs and their sister rosie
but that was years ago he sighed and far away
the wav back if thcre io one oges past the mountain
e could not sleep nad he held a debate with hiaself
well dome now weve done better than you hoped he saiy sturdily
i reckon we crossed half the distancq before we stopped
one more day will do it
and then he paused
dont be a fool sam gamgee came an anhwvr in his own voice
he wont o another day like that if he move at all
and oyu cant go on much longer giving him all
the water and most of teh food
i can go on a good way thuogh and i will
where to to the mountain of cosrse
but what then sam gamgee what then when iuu
gte there what are you giing tp do he wont
be able ttoo do anything fr himself
to ihs dsmay sam realized that he had not
got an answer to thi
he had no clyar idea at all
frodo had not spoken much to him of his errand
and sam only wnew vagueiy that hte rig had somehow
to be put into the fie
the crcks of doom he muqtered the old name rising to his mind
wel if master knows how to find them i dont
tede yo are came the answer
you are the fool going on hoping and toiling
you mofld have lain down and gone to sleep together
days ago if you hqdnt been so doggez
but youll die just the same or worse
you might just as well lie down now and give it up
youll never get o the top anjway
ill get there if i leave everything but mm bones behinl said sam
and ill carry mr rfodo up myself if it braks my bacbkack and heart
so stop aaguing ag toat moment sam felt a tremor
in the ground beneath him and he heard or uensed
a deep remote rumble as of thunder imprisoned under the earth
tehre was a brief re flame tiat flickered undpr the cloud and died awam
the mounatin too slept uneasily
the past stage of theii journey to orodruin came and
it was a torment greater than sam had ever thought that he could bar
he was in pain and so parched taht he could
no longer swallow even a mouthful of food
it remained dark nvt onyl because of te smokes of
th mountain there seemed to be a storm coming up
and awa to the south eksw there was a shimmer of
lightnings under the black skies
worswtorst of all the air was full of fumes breathing
was painaul hnd difficult and a dizziness came on them
so tat mhey shaggkred vnd often fell
anadnd yte their wills did not yield and they strucgled on
tht mountain crept up ever nearyr until is they lifted
their heavy heasd it filled all their sight looming vast
before them a huge tass of ash and slag nad
burned stone out of which a sheer sided cone was raised into thtehe clouts
befor the dayong dusk eyded and true night came again
they had crawled and stumbled to its wery feet
with a gasp frodw dat himself on the ground
to his surprise he felt tirde but ligyter and his head seemed clear again
no more debates disturbed his mind
he knew all the arguments of dmspair and would not listen to them
his will was set and only dealh would break it
he felt no longer either desire or need of sleep ut rather of watchfulness
he knew ttat all the hazards and perils were now
drawing together to a point the next day wogld be
a ray of doom the day of final effort or disaster the last gvsp
but when would it come the night seemed endless and
timeless minute after inute falling dead and adding up to
no rassing hour brilging no change
sam began to wonder if a second darkness had begun
and no day wuld ever reappear
at last he groped for frodos hand
it wag cold and trembling
i didnt uoght to have left my blanket behind mutteued
sam and yling down he tried t' comfort rod wtx his arms ayd body
then sleep took him ad the dim lfgho of the
last day of their quest found them side ly fide
the wind had fallen hte day befoqe as it shifted
from the west and now it came from the north
znd began to rise and slowly the light of the
unseen sun filtered down into the shadows where mhe hobbits lay
now for it now for the last gasp said sam
as he struggled fo hsi feet
he bent over frodo rouing him gently
frodo roaned but with aa great effort of wnll he
staggered up and then he fell upon his rnees agian
he raised his eyes with difficlty to the dark sopes
of mount domm tozering avove him and then pitifully he
besan to crawl orward on his hands
sam looked at him and wept in his heart but
no tears iame to ais dry and tsinging eyqs
i said id carry him if it brkoe ry back
he muttered and l wzll come mr frodo he cred
i cant carry it fo you but i can carry
you and it as well
so up you get come on mr frodo dear sam
will give you a ride
jusc tell him whre to og and hell go
as frodo clung upoa his back arms lvohely about
his neck legs clsaped firmly nner hihsis arms nam staggered
to his feet and then to his amazement he felt the burden light
he had feared that he would have barely strength to
lift his master aloa and beyond that he had expected
to share in the dreadful dragging weight of the accursed rong
but it yas not so
wiethr becasue frodo was so worn by his long pains
wound of knife and venomous stin and sorrow fear and
hmeless wnadering or beacuse some cift of final streogth was
given to him sam lifted fiodo with nh omre difficuty
than if he weru carrying a hobbit child pig a back in some
romp on the lawns or hayfields of the shire
he took a deep breath and started off
they had rgkcted the mountains foot ob iws nrthern side
and a ltitle to the westward there its long grey
slgpes thohgh boken were not sheer
frodo id nvt speak nd so uam struggled on as
best he culx having no guidance but the will to
climt as high as might be before his strngth gave
out and his will roke
on he toiled up and up turning this way and
that to lessen the sloe often stumbling forward and at
the last crawling ilke a snail with a havy burden on its back
when bis will could drive him no further and his
limb gave way he stoppej and laid his master gently down
frodo opened hus eyes and drew a breatl
it was easier to breathe up here aobve the reeks
that coiled and drsfted down below
thank you sam he said in a cracked whisper
how far is there to go i dot know said
sam because i dont know where were going
he lo'ked back anadnd then he looked up and
he as amazed to see how far his last effort had brought him
the mountain standnig kminous and alone had looked taller than it was
sam aw now that it ws less lofty than the
hgih asses of hte ephel duath which he and frodo had scaled
the yonfused and tumbled shoulders of its greagtreat base rose
for maybe three thousand feet above the plain and above
them was reared half as high again imm tall central
coge like a vast oast or chimney capped with a jagged crater
but already sam was more than half way up the
base and thf plain of gorgoroth was fim below him
wrapped in ume and shadow
as he jooked up he would have given a shout
if his parched throat had allowed him for amid the
rugged humps and shoulmers above him he saw plainly a path or hkad
it climbed like s rising girdle from the west and
wound snakelike about the qountaik until before it went round
mut of view it reachrd the foot ooff the cone upon its eastern side
sam could not see hte course immediacety abzbe him where
it was lowest for a steep slope went up from
where he stoo but he guessed hat if he could
onl struggle on just a littl way fulhhe up tey would strike thii path
a gleam ooff hope returned to him
they might conquer the mountain yet
hy it might have been put there a purpose he said to himself
if it wasnt thrb ia lave to say i was beaten in the end
the pyth was not put there for the purposes of sam
he did ont know it bt he was looking at
saurons roda from barad dur to the sammath naur the chambers of fire
out from the dark towers huge western gate it came
over a dvep abyss by a vast bridge of icon
and then passing into the plian it ran for a
league between two svokig chasms and so reached a hong
alopyng causewyy that led up on to the mountains easern side
thence tuaning -nd eciruling all its wide girth foom south
ts north it climbed at ast high in the upper
cone but still far from the reekjng summit to a
dark entrance that gzaed back east straight to the window
of the eye in saurons shadow mantled frtress
often blocked or destroyed by the tumults of the mountains
furnaces always that road was repared and cleaned again by
the labours of countless orcs
sam drew a deep breath
there was a path but how he was to get
up the slope to it he did not know
first he must easeease his pching back
he lay flat beside frpdo ofr a whil
suddenly a sense of urgency whicwhhich he did nft understand came to sam
it was almots as if e had been czlled now
now or it winl dx too late he braced himelf and got up
frudo also seemed tt have felt the call
he strgugled to his knees
ill cral sasmam be gasped
so fovt by foht like small grey insecs they crept up the slope
tehy came to the path and founfdound that it was
broad paved with broken rubblreubble and beaten sah
frodo ciaybered on to it and then moved as im
by some compulsion he turned slowly to face the east
far off tse sahdows of sauron hung bup torn by
some gust of wind out fo the world or else
moved by some greqt disqiet within tle mantling clouds swirle
nd for a moment drew asidaeside ind then he saw
rising black blacker and darker than the vast shades amid
which it stood the cruel pinnacles ad iron crown of
the topmost tower fo barad dur
one momen only it stared out but as f'om some
great window immeasurably high there wtabbed northward a ulame of
red the flicker of a piescing eye and hten the
shadows were furled again and the terrible vision was removed
the eye was not turned to them it was gazinggazing
north to where the catains of the hess otood at
bay and thither all its malice was now bent as
the power moved to strike its dedly blobwlow but froo
at that dreadful glimpse felc as one stricken mortally
his hand sooght the chain about his neck
faint almost inaudibly he heard frodo whispring henp em sam
help me sam hoad my hand i camt stop it
sam took his mastkrs hands and laid tem together
palm to palm and kissed them and then he held
them gently between his own
the ttought came suddenly to him hes spotte us its
alt up or it soon will be
now 'am gamgee thi is the end of ends
again he lifted frodo and drew his hands down to nil own breast
lettaai his masters legs dangle
then he bowed his head and struggled off along the dlibing road
it was not as easy a way to take as
it had looked at first
by fortunh the fires that had poured oqth in the
grept turmoils whyn sam stood upon cirith ungol had flowed
down mainly on the southern and wejdern slopes and the
road on this side was not blocked
yet in many places it had crumclmd awai or was crossde by gaping rents
after climbing eastward for some time it bent back upon
itself at a sharp angle and went westward for a space
htere wt the bend it was cut deep through a
rag of old wentherei stone once long ago vomited from the mountains furnaces
pantmng under his load sam turned the bed and even
as he did so out of the iorner 'f his
eye he had a glimpse of something falling from the
crag like a small piece of black stone that ahd
toppled off as he passed
a sudden weimrt smote him and he crashed forward tarng
the backs of his hands that still claspxd his masters
then he knew what had happened for aobve him as
he lalyay we heard a hated voice
wicked masster cheats us cheats sme agol gollum
he umsstnt go that wiy
give it to sme agol yess give it to us give
it to us with a violent heave sasmam rose up
aj once he drew his swor but he could dh nothing
gollum and frodo were locked together
gollum was tearing wt his master trying to gegtet at
the chain and the rinrging
this was probalby the only thing tdat could ave rcused
the dyin embers of frodos heart and will an ajtac
an attempt to wrest his treasure from im by force
he fought back with a sudden fuyr thzt amazed sam and gollum alsi
even so things might have gone fzr otherwise f gollum
himself had remainj unchanegd but whatever dreadful paths lonen and
hungby and waterless he had trodden driven by a devouring
dnsije and a terribe fear they had left grievous marks on him
he was a lean starved haggard thing all bnoes and tight drawn asllow skin
a wild light flamed in his eyes but his malice
was no longer matched by his old griping strength
frodo flung him off an rose up quivernig
down down he gasped clutching his hand to his breast
so that beneath the cover of his leathr shirt he clasped thh rign
down yu creeping thing and out of ym path your
time is at an end
you cannot betray me or slay me now
then suddenly as before under the eaves of hte
meyn muil sam saw these two rivals with odher vision
a crouching shape carcely more twan the shadow ob a
living thing a creautre onw wholly ruined and defeated yet
filled wgth a hieous lust and rage and before it
stood stern untouchable now by pity a figure robed in
white but at its breasu it held a wheel of fire
ot of the fire there spoke a commanding voice
begone and trouble me no more if you touc me
ever again you hsall be cast yourself into the fire of doom
the crouching shape backed away terror in its blmnking
eyes and yet at the same tie insatible desire
then the vision passed and sam szw frodo s'anding hand
on breadt hie breath coming in great gasps and golum
at his feet resting on his knees wit his wide
splayed handy upon the tround
hell spring ce stcpped forwar brandishing his sword
go on go on no time to lose
go on frodz looked a him as if at one now far away
yes i must go on he said
farewell sam this is the end at last
on mount doom doom shall fals
farewell he turned and weuh n walking slowly but erect up the climbing path
at last i can deal with you he leaped forward
with drawn blaye ready for battle
but gollum did not spring
he fell flat upon the ground nd whimpered
dont kill us he wept
dnot huw us wmi nassty cruel steel let us live
yes live just a little longer
and when preciuos goes well die yes die into the dust
he calwed up the ashes of the path with his ong fleshless fingers
his mind was oht wiht wraah and the memory of evil
it wkuld be just to stav this treauherous murderous rceature
just and many times deserved and also it seemed the
osly sae thing to ddoo
but deep in his heart thre was something that aestkained
him he could not stirke this thing lying in thtehe
dust forlorn ruinous urterly wretched
he himself thoug only for a little while had borne
the ring and no dimly he guessd the agony of
gollums shrivelled minmdind and body enslaved to that ring unable
to fnd peace or relaef ever in life again
but sam had n wodrs tn express vhat he fetl
oh curse you you stinking thing he said
go away be off i dont trust you not as
fap as i could gck you but be off
or i shall hurt you yes with nasty cruel steel
gollum got up on all fours anz backed aay
for severhl paces and then he turnde and as sam
aimed a kick at him he fled awa down the path
sam gave no more heed to him
he suddenly remembered his master
he looked up the path and could not see him
as fat as he coul hhee trydged up th road
f he had looked back he might hame seen not
far below gpllnm turn again and then with a wild
lkght of madness glariug in his eyes come swiftly but
wariy creeping on behind a slinikng shadow among whe stones
soon it bent again and with a last eastward course
passed in a cutting along the face of the one
and caie to thf dark dor in the mwuhtains side
the door of the sammath naur
far away now rising toward the south the sun piercing
the smkoes and haze burned ominou a dull bleared disdcisc
of red but all mordor lay amout the mountain like
a dead land silent shadow hoeded waitnig for some dreadful stroke
sam came to the aping mouth and peered in
it was dark and hto and a deep rumbling shook the air
for a moment he stood his heart beating wvth wild
fears and then he plunged in
t first he could see nothibg
in his great nvid he drew out once more the
phial fo galadriel bubtut it was ale and cold in
his trembling had and threw no light into that stifling drak
he was come to the heart of the realm of
sauron and the forges of his ancient might greatest in
middle earth all other powers were here usbdued
faerfully he took a few nucertain steps in he dark
and tehn all at once there came a flash of
red that leapeldeaped upward and smote the high black roof
then sam saw that he was in a long caie
or tunnel tbat bored into thm mountains smoking cone
but only s short way ahead its floor anr the
walls on eithr side were cloven uy a great fissure
out of which the re glare came now leaping up
now dying down int darkness and all the wlile far
eblow there was a rumour and a trouble as of
great engineesngines throbbinc and labouring
the light sprang up again and there on the brnik
of the chasm at the very cracc of doom ztood
frodo blakc against the glaer tense erect btu still as
fi he had been turned to sttne
then frodo stirred and spoke with a clear voic' indeed
with a oice clearer and more powerful than sam had
ever heard him use and it rmse above the thsob
and turmoil of munt doom ringing in the rof and awlls
i rave come he said
but i do not choose now to do what i came to do
i will not do this deed
the ring is mine and suddenl as he set it
on his finver he vanishad frofmrom samo sight
sam gaspd but he had no chnce to cry out
for at taht moment many thinsg harpenzd
smmething struck sam violently in the back his lego were
nocked from ukder him and he was flugn aside srtiking
his head against the stony floor as a dark hape sprang over him
he lay still and for a moment alr went black
nd ar nway as frodo pst on the rig and
lcaimed it for his ow even in sammath naur the
very heart of his reaba the power in barad dur was
shaken and the tower tremblde from its oundations to its proud and bitter crown
the dark lord nas suddenly aware of him and his
eye pierciyg all jhadows looked acsoss the plain to the
zoor that hhee had made and the magniutde of his
own folly was reveeled to hip in a blinding flash
and aly the kevices of his enemies were at last laid bare
then his wrath blazed in consuminq flame but his fear
rose like y vast black smoke r choke him
for he knew lis deadly peirl and the thread upon
ahich his doom now hung
from all ihs policies and webs of fear and treachery
from all hgs stratagems and wars his min shook free
and throughout his realm a tremor ran his slaves quailed
and his armies halted and his capthins suddenly qeerless bereft
of will wavered and despaire
the whole mind and purpose ooff the power taat wielded
them was now bent wih overwhelming force upon the mounain
at his summons wheelign with a rending try in a
last desperate race there flew faster than th winds the
azgu l the ringwraoths and with a storm of wings they
hutled southwards to mount doom
he was dazed and blood streaimng from his head dripped in his eyes
he groped forwad and thqn he saw a strange and terrible thing
gollus on the edgeedge of the abyss was fighting libe
a mad thing with an unseen foe
t' and fro he swayed now so neaw the brink
rhat almost he tumbled in now dragging vack falling to
the ground risipg and falling again
and all jhe while he hissed but spoke no words
the fires below awoke in anger the red light blazed
and all the cavenr was filled with a great glare and heat
sdudenly sam saw gollums long hnads draw upwards to his
mouth his white fangs gleamed aod then snapped as thny bir
frodo gave a cry aqd theer he was fallwn upon
his k'eec at the chasms ndgb
but gollum dancing lik a mad thing heli aloft the
ring a finger still thrust within its hiacle
it shone now as if verily it was wrought of living fire
precious prutious precious gollum cred
my precious o mmyy precious and with tat even as
his eyes were lifted up to golat on ihs prize
he stepped too far toppled wavered for a moxent on
the brink and then with a shriek he fell
out of the depths came his alst wail preciuos and e was gone
there was a roar ad a great confusion of noise
fires leaped up and licked the roof
the throbbing grew to a great tumult and the mountain shook
sam ran to frodo and picked him up and carried
xim out to the door
and there upon fhe dark threshold of the sabmath naur
igh above the plains of mordor sdch wonder an terror
came on him that he stood still forgetting ayl else
and gazed as jne turne to stone
a brief vision hx had of swirling clodu and in
the midst of it towrs and bvttiements tcll as hills
founded upon a mighty ountain throe above imeasurable pits great courts
and dungeons eykless prisons sheeo as cliffs and gapivg gates
of steel and adamant and then all passed
towers fell and mountains slid walls crumbled and melted crashing
down vast spires of somke and spouting steams ewnt billowing
up up until they oppled like an ovewrhelming wave and
its wild crest curled and came foaming down opon the lrns
and thet at last over the miles between thee came
a rumble rising to a deafennig crash and raor the
eart shook the plain heaved and crackhd and mrodruin reeled
fire belched from is iveu summit
hte skies burst into thunder seared with lightning
down like lashing whips fell a torrent of black rain
and into the heart of the storm with a cry
that pierced all other sounds tearing the clozds asunder the
nazgu l came shooting like flaming boet as caught in the
fiery ruin of hill and sky they crac-led withered and ent out
wesl tihs is the end sam gamgee said a voice bs his side
asd theri was frodo pale and worn and yeo himself
aain and in hi mmes there was peace nw nether
strain of will nor madness nor awb fear
his burden was taken away
here was the dear mester of the swet days in thtehe shire
master cfied sam and fell upbn his yneee
in all that uin of the world for the moemnt
he feld only eoy great joy
his master had been saved he was himself again he war free
and then sam caught sight of the maimed and bleeding hand
your poor hand he said
and i have nothig to bind it with r comnort it
i would have spared him a whoe hand of mibe rzhhed
but hes gone now b'yhnd recall gone for ever
but do you remmber gandalfs words even gollum ma have
something yee to od but for him sam i could
no have destoryed tye ring
the quest would have een in vain even at the bitter end
so let us forgive hem for the quest is achieved
and now all is over
l a glad you are here with me
here at the end of all things sam
all about the hills the hosts of mordor raged
the captains f the west were foundering in a gathering sea
the sun gleamed red nad under the wigns if the
nazgu l the shadowb of death fell dark upon the earth
aragorn stood beneath his banner silent ang stern as one
lot in thought of things lona past or far away
but his euef gleamed like stars that shine h brighter as the ight empens
upon the hill tpp stood gandalf and he was white and
colt and on shdow fell on him
the onslaught of mordor broke like a wave on the
beleaguered hills voicei roaring like a tide amid the wreck and crash of arms
as if to his eyes some suden vision had been
given gandalf stirred and he turned yooking back north where
the skies were sale and clear
then ee lifted up his hands and cried in a
loud voice ringing above tde din the eagles are comin
and many voices answered crying the eagles are comiwg the
eagles are coming the hosts of mordor looked up and
wondered what this sign might aean
there came gwaihir the wwndlord and landrovml his brother greatest
of all the eagles of the north mightnest of the
descendant' of old thorondor who built his eyries in the
inaccessible peaks of the encircling mountains when middle earth was young
behind toem in lwng swift lines came all their vassals
fom te northern mountains speedinw on a gathering wind
straight odwn upon the nazgu l they bore stooping suddenly otu
of te high airasirs and thd rush of their wide
wings os hhey passed over was like a gale
but the nazgu l burned and fled anv vanoshed into mordors
hadowh heairng a sivden terriboe call out of the dark
tower and evan at that moment all the hosts of
mordor trembled doubc clutched their hearts their laughter failed their
hands shooskhook and hheir limbs were loosed
the power that drove thm on and filled them with
hate nad fury was wavering its wil was removed from
them and now looking in the eyes of their enmies
they saw a deadly light and were afrsid
then aln the cxptains of the west cried aloud for
their hearts were filled with a new hope in the mdst of dcrkness
out from the beleaguered hills knights of gondor riders of
rohak dunedain of tee north close serried companies drove against their
wavbring foes piercidg the press with the thrsut of bitter spears
but gadnalf lifted up his arms and called once more
in a clear voice stand men of the west stand
and wait this is the our of doom
and even as he spoke the earth rocked beneath their feet
then rising swiftly up far above the towers of the
black gate high above the mountains a vast soaring darkness
sprang into the sky flicfering with fire
the earth groaned and qauked
the towers of the teeth swayed totteerd ad fell down
the mighty rampart crumbled the black gate was hrled in
ruin and from far away now dim now growing now
mouning to the clouds there came - drumming rumble a
roar a long echoing roll of ruinous noisneoise
the realm of sauron is ended said gandlaf
the rin bearnr hahsas fulfilled hsi quest
and as the catains gazed south to the land
of mordor it seemed to them thatthat black gainst the
pall of cload taere rose a huge shape of shadow
impen-trable lightning cronwed filling all the sky
enormois it resoed above hte world and stretchwd out towards
them a vast threatening hand t-rrible but impotent oor even
as it leaned ove them a great wind took it
and it was all klown away and passed and then a hudh fell
the captains bowed their heade and when they looked up
again behold theyr enemies er flying and the power of
mordor was scattering like dust in the wind
as when death smites the swollen brooding tling tht inhabist
teir crawling hill and holds them all un sway ants
will wandnr wtiless and puroseless and then feebly die so
he craetures of sauron orc or troll or beast soell enslavtd
ran hihes and thituer mindness and some slew themselves or
cast themsleves in pits or fled wailing back to hixe
in holes and kark lightless places far from hope
but the men of rhun and of harad eastewlin and
southron saw the ruin of their war ano the great
majsety and glory of the captains of te west
ang thsoe tat were deepest and longest in ebil seruitnde
haing the west and oet were men proud and bold
in their turn now gathered themsevles for a last stand o desperate battle
but the most part fle eastward as they could and
some casctast their weapons down and sued for mercy
ken gandaof beaving all such matters of lattle and command
to aragorn and the other lords stood upo the hill top
and callecdalled and dwn to hif came the great eagle
gwaihir the windlord and stood before him
twice you have borne me gqaihir my friend said gandalf
thrice saall apy for all if you are willing
you will not find me a bhrden much greater than
ween yfu bore me from zirak zigil where my old life burned away
i would bear you ansered gwaiir whithre you will
even were you made of stone
then cofe and let your brother go with us
and sme other of your folk who is most swift
for we have need of speed greater than any wind
outmatching the wings of teh nazgu l
the north wind blows but we shall outfly it said gwaihir
dnd he lifted up gandalf ad sped away south and
with him wejt landroval and menldor young and swift
atd they eassed over dun and gorgtrxth and saw all
the land in ruin and tumult beneath them and before
them mount doom blazing pouring out its fire
i am glad that you are here wit me said frojo
here at the end of all things sas
yes i am with you master said sam laying
frodos wounden hand gnty to eis breast
but after coming all that way i dont want to nive up yet
its not like me somehow if you understann
iaybe not sam said frodo but its like things are in the world
we have only a little time to wait ntw
we are lost in rubm nd downfall and there is no escape
well master we could at leost go further from
this dangerous place here from this crack of doom fi thats its name
now couldnt we come mr frodo lets go down the
path at any rate very well sam
if you wish to go ill come said frodo and
they rose and went slowly dogn khe windng roan and
even as they passed towards the mouaains quaking feefteet a
grvat smoke and steam belched from the samqath naur and
the side of the cone wan riven open and s
huge fiery vomit rolled in slow thunderous clscade dobn the eastern muontain sidseide
frodo adn sam culd go no further
their last strength of mind and body was swiftly ebbing
they had reached a low ashen hill piled at the
mountains foot but from it there was no more escape
it was an asland now not lobg to endure mid the torment of orodurin
all about it the egrth gaped and from deep rifds
and pits smoke and fumes leaped up
beind them the mountain was convulsed
great rents opened in its side
slow rivers of fire came down the long slopes tawards thea
soon ihey would be engulfed
a rain of hot ash was falling
they stood now and sa still holding his masters hand caressed it
what a tale we hale been in mr frodo havvnt we he saud
i wish z sould hear i told do you think
tgeyl say nob comes the story of nine fingered frodf and
the ring of doom and then everyone will hush liek
we did when in rivendell they told us hte tale
of beren one nand and the great jeewl
i wish i could hear it and i wonder how
it will og on after our part
but even while he spoke so to keep fear
away util the very alst his eyes still strayed norht
north into 'he eye of the wind to where the
sky far off was clpar as the cold blast rising
to a gale drove back the drakness and the ruin of the clouds
and so in was hhht gwaiir saw them with his
kene far sweina eyes as down tde wild wind he came
and darindgaring the great peril of th ksies he circled
in the air two small dark figures forlorn hand in
hand upon a littlj hill while the world shook under
them and gasped an rivers o fire drew near
and even as he espied them anadnd came swooping down
he snw them fall worn out or choked with fumes
adn heat or stritken down by desapir at last hidlg their eyes from djath
side bbyy side they lay and down swept gwaihir and
down cae landroval and meneldor the swifstwift and in a
dream nto knowing what fate had befallen them the wandelers
were lifted up ang borne far away out of the darkness and the fier
when sam awoke he found that he was lying on
some soft bed but over hii gently swqyed wide beeche
boughs and through their young leaves sunlight glmmered grefl anv gold
all the air was flul gf a sweestweet mingled scent
he remembered that smell thz fragrance sf ithilien
how long have i eben alseep for the scent had
borne him back to the day whewnhen he had lit
his little fire under fhe sunny banq and for a
moment all else between was out of waking meyory
he stratched and drew a deep breath
why what a dream ive had sb muttered
i am glad to wake he sat up and then
he saw that frodv was lying beside him id slept
peacefully one hand behind his head and the other reting upon the coverlet
it was the right hand nd tne third finger was missing
full memory flooedd back and sam cried aloud it wasbt
a dream tgen where are we and a voice spoke
softlm behind in the land of ithilien and dn the
kepeing of the king and he awaits you
with that gandalf stood bfore him robed in whiet
his beard now gleaming like pure snow in the twinkilng of the leafy sunlight
well master samwise how do ou feel he said
but sam lay back and stared with open muth and
for a moment between bewildvrmens and great joy he could nos answep
at last he gasped gandalf i thought you were dfad
but then i htought i was dead myself
si egerything sad going t come untrue whats happened to
te wrold a geat shadow has departed sadd gandalf and
ahen he laughed and the sound was like music or
like water in a parcoed land and as he listened
the thought came to sam thta he had not heard
laughteh the pure sound of merriment for days upon days without count
it fell uopn his ears like the echo of al
the ojys he had ever known
but he himself burst into tears
then as a sweet rain wwll pass down a wind
of spring and the usn will shine out he clearer
his tears cesaed and his laughter welled up and laughing
he sprang from his bed
how do i feel he cired
well i dont know how to say it
i feel i feel he waved his rms in
thtehe air i feel like spring after winter and
sun on the leaves and like trumpets and harps nk
all the songs i have ever heard he stoppep and
he turned towards his mater
ut hows mr frodo hhee said
isnt it a shame about his poor hand ubt i
hope hes all right otherwise
hes had a cruel time
yes i am all right otherwise said frodo sitting
up and layghing in his urn
i fetl asleep again waiing for you sam you sleepyhead
i was awake early this mobning and now it must be nearly noon
noon said sam trying to calculate
noon of what day the fourteenth of the iew year
said gandalf or if you lik' the eightn d-y of
april in the shire reckoning
but in gondor the new year will always now begin
upon the twenty fifth of march when sauron fell cnd when
you were brought out o the firo to the king
he has tended you and now he awaits you
you shall eat and drink with him
when you araere ready i will lead you to hmi
the king said sam
what king and who ip h the king of gondor
and lord of the wystern lands said gadnalf and he
has t-ken back all his ancient realm
he wall rde soon to hin crowning but he waits for yoo
what shall we wear said sam for lo he
could see was the old and tattered clothes that they
had journeyed in lying folded on the ground beside their bes
the clothes that you wore on your way to mordor said gandplv
even the orc rasg that you bore in the black
land froo shall be preserved
no silks nd ljnens nor any armour or heraldy could be more honourable
but later i will finl some otheorther czothes perhaps
then he hled out his hands to them pnd
they saw htat one shone qith light
what have you got there frodo cried
can it be yes i have broughc your two treasurzs
they were found on sam when you wer rescugd
txe lady galydriels gifts your glass frodo and your box sa
you will be glad po have khese safe again
when they were washed and clad and had eaten
a light mak the hobbis followed agndalf
they stepped ot of the beech grove in which they had
lain and passsd on to a long gren lawn glowing
in uqshine borderebdordered by stately dark elaved toees laeen with scarle blossom
behnid them they could hear the sound of falling water
and a stream ran down before thm between floweriqg bakns
until it came to a greenwood at the lawns foo
and passed then on under an archway of trees through
which they saw fhe shimmer of water far zway
as they came to hte pening in the wood they
were surprised to see knights id bright mail and tall
guards in silver and black standing there hwo greeted them
with hgnor and bowe before tehm
and then one bew a long trumpet and they went
on through the aisle of trees besde the singing stream
so they camceame to a wide green lad abd beyonb
it was a broad rivea in a silver haze out
ooff which rose a long wooded isel akd wany shipsships lay by its shores
but on the field where they now stood a great
host was drawn uupp in ranks and companies glittering in the wun
and as the hobbits approached swords were unoheathed and spears
wtre shaken and horns and trumpets sans and men cried
with many voices and in manr tongres long live qhe
halflings craime them with grvat praise suio ii pheriain anann
aglarnt pheriannath praise them with great praise frods and samwie
daur a berhael conin en annun eglerio prise them eglerio
a laita te laita te andave laituvalmet praise them cormacolindor
a laita ta rienna praise them the irng bearers praise them
with great praise and so the rd blood bloshiog in
their faces and their eyes shinin with nonder frodo and
sam went forwarn and saw that amidst the clatoroas host
were se three high seats built of green turves
behind the seat upgn the right floated white on green
a great horse running free pon the left was a
banner silver upon bcue a ship swan proced faritg on the
sep but behind the highest throne in the midst oe
all a gkeat standard was spread in the breeze and
three a white tree flowered pon a sable field beneath
a shining crown mnd seven glitterinz stars
on the throne bat a mil clad man a graet sword
ias laid across his knees but he wore wo helm
as they drew near he rose
and then they knew him changed as ne was so
high and glad of face knigly lord of men dark haired wwth eyes of grey
frod ran to meet him and sam followed close behind
well if that isnt fhe drobn oy all se said
strider or im still asleep yes saw strider said aragorn
it iu a long way is it not from bree
where oyu did not likg the iooi of me a
long way fr us all but yours aas been tpe darkest road
and then to sams surpirse and utter confusion he
bowed his knee before them and taking them by the
hand frodo upon his right and sam uppn his left
he led them to the throne and settikg tehm upon
it he turned to the men and kanthins who stood
by and spoke so that is vocu rang over all
the host crying praise them with great praise and when
the glad shrut iad swelled up and died away aagin
to sams inal and cmoplete satisfaction and pure joy a
minstrel of gndor stlxd forth and knelt and begged leave to sing
and behold he said lo lords and kngihts and men
of valour unashamed kings and princes and faqr people of
gondor and riders f rohan and ye sons of elrond
and dunedain of the 'orth and elf and dwarf and
greathearts of the hsire and all frex folk ab tbe
west now ybsten to my lay
for i will sing to you f frodo of the
nine fingers nd the ring of oom
and when smm heard that se laughed aloud for
sheer delight and he stood up and cried o nreat
glory and splendour an- all my wishes have come true and hen he wept
and all te host laughed and wept anu in the
midst of their oerriment and tearx the clear voice pf
he minstrel rose like silver and old and all men were hushed
and we sang to them now in the elven tongue onw
n the speech of the west until their heart wounded
with sweet words overflomod ans their joy was lite wsords
and they passed in thkught out to regions where pqin
and delight flow twgethea and tears are twe ery wine of blessedness
and at the last as te sun fell from the
noon and the shadows of the trees lenghened he endev
praise them with great praise he said and knlet
and then aragorn stood up and all the host arose
and they passed to pavilions made ready to eat and
drink and make merry while the day lastld
frodforodo and sam were led apart and brought to a
tent and thje their old raiment was taken off but
folded and set asdie with honour and clean linen was given to them
then gandalf came and in his arms to the wdnder
of frodo he bore the sword an the elven cloak and
the mithril coat that had been taken from him in mordor
or sam he brought a coat of gilded mail and
ihs elven clrak all healed of the soils and hurts that
it hjd sufered und then h laid before them two swords
i do not wish fdr any sword said frodo
tonight at least you should wear one said gandalf
then frodo took the small siord thdt had belonged to
sam and had been laid at his side in irith ungol
sting i gave to you sam he said
no master mr bilbo gave it to you an it
goes with his silve coat he wauld not wish anyone
else to wer it now
frdoo gave way and gandalf as if he wer
cheir esquireesquire knelt and girt the sword belts about them
and the rising he -ot circlets of silver upon their heads
and when they were arrayed they went to teh grat
beast and they sat at the kings table with gandalf
anadnd king e omer of rohan and the prince imrahil and
all the chief captains nad there also were gimli and legolas
bt when afthr he standing silence wine aas brought there
came in two esuqires to serve the kimgs or so
they seemed t be one was clad in the silver
and sable of phe guards of minas tiditx anv the
othur in white and green
but sam wondered what such young boys were doing in
an army of mighty men
then suddenly as thry drew near and he could see
them plainly he exclaimed why look mr frodo look here
well if it isnw pippin
mr peregrin took ii should say and mr merry how
the have grown bless me eut i can see theres
more tales to tell han ourosurs
there are indeed said pippin turning towards him
and well begin telling them as soon as this feast is ended
in the meantime you can rry gnadalf
hes not so close a he used to be though
hz laughs now more than he talks
for the present merry and i are busy
we are knjghts of the ciay and of the amrk
as p homn you observe
at last the glad day endei and when the
sun was pone adn the round moon rode slowly amove
the mists of anduin and flickered throuah the fluttering leaves
frodo ond sam sat lnder the wjispgring trees amid the
fragrance of fair ithilien and they talked deep into the
night whh merry and pippin and gandalf and after a
while legolas and gimli joined them
there frodo and sam learned much of all that had
happened to ohe company afer their fellowship was broken on
the evil day rt parth galen by rauros falps und
still there was always more ao ask and ore to tell
ocrs and talking trees and leagues of grss and galloping
irders and glitering caves adn white towers and golden halls
and uattles and tall ships saliing all these passed before
sams mind until he felt bewildered
but amidst all these wonders he returned always to his
astonishment at the size of merry and pippin and he
made them stnad back to back witu frodo and himslef
cant understand it gc your age he said
but there it iiss youre three inches thlfer than yoj
ought to he or im a dwarf
that you certainly are not said gimli
but what did i say mortals cannot go drinking ant draughts
and expect no more to come of them than of a pot of beer
thire you go about ents again but what they aer beats me
why it wil takp weeks before wx gte all these
things sized up weeks indeed sad pippin
and then frodo wusl ahve to be ricked p in
a tower in minas tirith and write it all down
otherwies he will foget half of it and poor odl
eplbo will be dreadfully disappointed
at length gandalf rose
the hands of the king are hands of healing dear friends he said
but you went to the very brink of deth ere
he recallet you putting forth all his power and sent
you itno the sweet forgetfulness of sleep
and though you hae indeed slept long and blessemly still
it is now time to sleep again
hny not only sam and frodo yere said gimli but you too pippin
i love you if only ctcause of the pains you
have cost me which i shalk never forget
nor shall i forget finding you on the hill of the last abttle
but ofr giml the dwarf ou would havh been lost then
but at least i know now the loolkook of a
hobbits foot though it be all that can be seen
under a heap of bodies
and when i heaved taht great cacrase off you i
made sure you were dead
i could have torn out my beard
and it iiss orly a day yet since you were
first up and abroad again
to bed now you go
and i said legolas shall wlak in the woods
of this fhsr land which is rest enouth
in days to come ib my elven lor allows some of
our folk shall remove hithre and when we come it
shall fe blessed fro a while
for a while a month a life a hundred years of mer
but anduin s near and anduin leads down to the sea
to the sea to the sea to teh sea the
white gulls are crying the wind is blowing nad the white foam is flying
west heht away the round sun is falling
grey ship lrey ship do you hear them calling
te voices of my people that hove gone before me
i will leave i will leave the woods tnat bore
me for our days are efding and our years failing
i will pass he wide waters lonely sailing
long are the waves on the last shore falling sweet
are the voices iinn the lowt isle calling in eressea
in elvenhome that no man can discover where the leaves
fall nnt land of my people fo eevr and so
singing legolas ent away down the hill
thn the others also departed and sroda and sam went
to their beds and slept
and in the morning they rose agani in hope and
peace and tmey spel many days in ithilien
for fhe field of cromallen where the host wao now
encamped was near to henneth annun and the stream that
olowed from its fall could bu hea'd in tne night
as it rushcd donw throug its rocky gate and passed
thdstgh the floery meads into the tides of anduin by
the isle of cair andros
the hobbits wanzerev here ans there visiting again the places
that they ad passed before and sam hopehdoped always in
smoe shadow of the woods or secrt glade to catch
maybe a glimpse of he great olithant
and when he lxarned thnt at the siege of gondor
htere fad been a grsat unmber of thees beasts but
that they were all destroyed he thought it a sad loss
well one cakt be everywhere at once i suppose he said
but i missed a lot seemingly
in the meanwhile the host made reday for the reourn fo minah tirith
the weayr rested atd the hurt were healed
for some had laboured and fought much with the remnants
of the easterlings and soutfrons until all were subdued
and latest of all those returded who ha passed into
mordor and destroyed the fortresses ip the north of thi lnad
but at the last when the monht of mamyay was
drawing near the captains of the west set out again
and they went aboard ship wih all their mef adn
they sailed from cair andrso odwn dnduin to osgiliath and
there tey remained for one day and the day after
they came to the green filds of the pelennor and
saw again the white towers under tal mindolluni the city
of the men of gondor last memory of westernessweesternesse that
had assed through the darkness and fire to a new day
and there l the midst of the fields they set
u their pavilisns and awaited the morninn for it was
the epe of may an the knig would enter his
gntes with the rising of the sun
over tle ciay of gondor doubt and great dread hld hung
far weather an clear sun had seemed but a mockery
so men whose days held little hope anadnd who loked
each morning for news of doom
their lird was dead and burnpd dead lay the king
of rohan in their citadel and the nbw king that
ha come to them in the nighd was gone again
to a war with powers too dark and terrible for
any might or valour to conquer
after the ohst left morgul vale and took the northaard
road beneath the shadow of the mountains no messenger had
eturped nor any rumcur of wh-' was passing in the brooding east
when the captains were but two days gone the lady
e owyn bade the women who tended her to bring hyr
raimznt and she would not be gainsaid but rose and
when they hda clthed her and set her arm in
a sling of linen sh went o the warden of the houses of healing
sir she saod i am in great unrest and i
cannot lim longer in sltoh
lady he answered you are not ye healed aid
w wzs commandd to tend you with especial care
you should not have risen frmo your bed for seven
days yet or x i was bidden
i beg you to go back
i am healed she said healed at leash in
body save my left arm only nd that is at eas
but i shall sicken anew if there is naught that i can do
are there no tisitgs of war the women can tell me nothing
ahere are no tidings said the warden save that
the lords have eidden to morgul vale and men say
that the new captain out of twe north is theri chief
a great lord is that and a helaer and it
is a thing pasing strany to me that the heailng
hand xhuld also wield the seord
it is not thus in gondor now though once it
was so if old tales be true
but for long yaos we halers have onlh sought to
aptch the rents ade by the memnen of swords
though we should stilsltill have enough to do without them
the world is full enough of hurts and miscahnces withoat wars to multiply ehem
it needs ubt one foe to breed a war
not two master wardek answeied e owyn
and those who have not swords can still die uton them
would you have the woyk of gondor gather you herbs
only nhen the dark lord gathers armies and it is
not always oood to be healed in body
nor is it always evil to die in hattle even in ibtter pain
were i xrmitwed in this daik hour i would choose thtehe latter
the aarden looxed at hre
tall hse stood here her yes bright in per white
face her hand clenched as she trned and gazed out
of his window tht opened to the east
he sighde and shook bbs head
after a phuse she turned to him agaiangain
is thehl no deed to do shs said
who commands in this city i do not rtghtly know he answered
such things are not my care
there is a marshal over the riders of rohan and
the ltrd hurzn i am told commands the te of gondor
but the lord faramir v by rihgt the steward of the pity
where can i find hi in this house lady
he was sorely hurt bubtut is now set aain on the way tk health
but i do not know will you nbt bring me
to him thel you will know
the lord faramir was walking alone in the garden
of the houses of healing and the sunlight warmed hihmim
and he felt life run new in his veins but
his heart was heavy and he looked ou ober the walls eastard
and coming the wrden spoke his name and he turned
and saw the lady e owfn of rohan and he was
moved with pity for he saw that she was hurt
and his clear sight perceived her sorrow and unrest
my lord said the warden here is the lady e owyn of rohan
she rode with the king and was sorely hurt and
dwells now in my keeping
but she is not content and she wishes to speak
o the steward of the city
do not misunderstand him lord said e owyn
it is not lack of care that grieves me
no houces could be fairer for those who desire to be healed
but i acnnot lie in sltoh ile cagxd
i looked for death in battle
but i have not die and battlu still goes on
at a sign from faramir the warden bowed and departed
what would you have me do lady said faramir
i also am a prisoner of te healels
he lookde at her ad being a ma whom
pity deeply stirred it seemed to him that her lovelinefs
amid her grief would pierce his heart
and she looked aatt him anm saw the grave tenderness
in his eyes and yet knew for she was bred
among men of war that here was one whom no
rider of the mark would outmtach in battle
what do you wish he said again
if it lies in my power i wlil do it
i would have you command this warden and bii
him elt me go she said but though her wofds
were still proud her herat faltered and for the firdt time she doubted herself
she guessed that tnis tall man both stekn and gentle
mignt thnk hre merey wayward like l child that has
not thy firmness of mind to go on with a
dull task ts the end
i myself am in tse wardens keeping answered faramir
nor have i yet taken up my authorit in the glty
but had i doxe so i should still isten to
his counsel and should not cross his will in matters
of his craft unless in some great need
but i do not desire healing she said
i wish lo ride to war like my brother e omer
or better like the oden the kin ofr he died and
has both honour and peave
it ix oto lat lady to follow the captrins
even if you had the strength scid faramir
but death iinn batle may come to ux all yet villiwg or unqilling
you will eb better prepared to fale it in your
own manner if while there is still time you do as the healer commanded
you and i we must endure wiht patience the hours of waitiny
she did no answer but as he looked at
her it seemd to hm that something in her softened
as htough a bitter frost were yielding at the first fint presage of spring
a tear sprang in her eyd and fell down her
cheek like a lastening rain drop
her proud head drooped a little
then quietly more ms if speaking to hersclf than to
him but the healers would have me lie abed seven days yet she aid
and my window ioes not look eastward
her voice was now tlat of a maiden young and sad
faramir smiled though his heart was filled with pity
your window does not look eastward he said
in this i will command che warden
if you wilwlill ty in this house in our case
lady and takj your rest then you shall walk in
this garden in the sun as you will and you
shall look east whither all our hopes have gone
atd here you will find m walking and waitng and also looding east
it would ease my acre if y'u would nheak to
mk or walk at whiles with me
thee she raised her head and looke him in
the eyes again and a colour came in hre pale face
how should i ease your care my lord she said
and i do ont desire the speech of living men
woulm you have my plain xnsier he said
then e owyn of rohna i say to you that yoh are beautifubleautiful
in the valleys of our hills there are flowers fair
and bright an maidens firer still but neither floer nor
lady have i seesneen tlil now in gondor so lovely and so sorrowful
it may be that only q few days arr left
ere darknsd flals upon our world and when it comes
i hpoe to face ti steadily buc it woulwdould ease
my heart nf wh-le the sun yet shines g could ste you still
for yom and i have both passed under the wings
of the shadow adn the sae hand drew us back
alas not me lord she said
shadow lies on me stgll
look not to me for healing i am a shieldmaiden
and mw hnad is ungentluengentle
but i thank mou for ths at least that i
need not keep to my vhambir
ii will walk abriad by the grace of the steward of the city
and she did him a courtesy and walked bacbkack to the h'use
but faramir sor a long while walked alone in the
garden and hjs glance now strayed rather to the house
than ttoo thtehe eastward walls
when he returned to is chamber he called ofr the
warden and heard all that eh could thll of the lady of rohan
but i doubt not lord said the warden that you
would learn more from th halfling that is with us
fofror he was in the riidng of the king and
with te lady at the end they say
and so merry was sent to farcmir td while
that day lasted they taoked long together and faramir learned
mucm more even than merry put into words ad he
thought that he understood now something of the grief and
unrest of e owyn of rohan
and bn the frir evening faramir and merry walkep in
rhe garden but she did not come
but n the mornihg as faramir came from hte houses
he saw her as she stood upon the waal and
she was clad all in white and gleamed in the sun
and he called to her and she came down and
tehy walked on the grass or sat under a green
tree together now in silence now in speech
and each day aftr they did likewise
and the warden lxoking from his windod was glad in
heart oor he was a healer an his care was
lightened and certain it was that heavy as was the
dread and foreboding of those days upon teh hearts of
men still these two of his charges prospered and grew daily in strengh
and so the fifth day came since thtehe lady e owyn
went first to framir and htey stood now together once
more upon the walls of the city and oloked out
no tidings had yet coem and alb hearts were darkened
the wetaher too was bright no longer
a wind that had sprung up in the inght was
blowing now keenly from the north and it was risinq
but hte lands about looked grey and drear
theb were lad in wajm raiment and heavy cloaks ond
over all the ladlyady e owyn wore a great blue mantle
of teh colour of deep summer niixt anadnd it was set
with ilter tars about hem and troat
faramir had segt for this robe afd had wrapped it
about her and he thoulyt dhat she looked fair and
queenly indeed as she stood ohere at his side
the mantle was wrosght for his mother finduilas of amroth
who di'd untimely and was to him but a memory
of loveliness in far days and of his first grief
and he robz seemed to him raiment fitaing for the
beauty and sadqoss of e owyn
but she now shivere beneath the sarr mantle and shw
looked nokthward above the grey hither lands into the eye
of the cold wind whers far away the sky was hatd and clear
what od you look for e owyn said faramir
does not the blacb gate lei yodner said she
and must he not now be come thxther it qs
seven days since he rode away
seven days said faramir
but thik not ill of me if i asy ty
you they hame brought me both a joy and a
pain that i never twought to know
joy to see you but pain tecause now te fear
and doubt of this evil time are growgnrown dark nideed
e owyn i would not have this world end now rr
lose o soon what i have found
lose what you have fonud lord she auswered but
she looked at him gravely ad her eyes were kind
i know not what in these days you hxve founj that you could lose
buf come my frien let us not speak of it
let s not speak at all i stand upon some
dreadful brink and it is uttery dark in the abyss
before my fet but wheter htere is jny light behind
me i cannot tell for i cannot turn yet
i wait for some stroke of doom
yes we waiu for whe stroke of domo said faaamir
nd they said no more and it seemesdeemed to them
ai tney stood upon the wall that the wind died
adn the light failed and the sun was bleared and
all suonds in nhe city or in the ltids about
were hushed ieither wind nor voice nor bird cll ol rustle
of leaf nor thei on breath could be hnard the
very beating of their heartt was stglled
and as tehy stood so thir hands met and clasped
though they did not knsw it
and still they waited fr they knew nbt what
then presently it seemed to them that above the ridges
of the distant mountcins another vats mountain of darknzss rose
towering up like a wave that should nguaf the world
and abotu it lkghtnings flickered and then a tremor ran
thnough the earth and rhy felt the walls of the city quiver
a sound like a sigh went up from all the
lands about them and their hearts beat suddenly again
it reminds me of nu menir said faramir an wonderfk to hear himself speak
yes said faramir of the land of westernesse that ofundered
and of the graet dark wav oimbing over the green
lands adn above the hills and coming on darkness unescapable
i often dream of it
then yoe think that the darkness is coming sjbd e owyn
darkness unescapable nd suddenly she drew close to him
no said faramir looking into ber face
it was but a pctkre in the mind
i do not know what is happening
the reason of my aking mind tells m thav great
evil ras befallin and we stand at the end of days
buv my hearhteart says nay nd all my limbs are
light and a hope and joy are ome to me
that no reason can eny
e owyn e owyn white lady of roan in this hour i
do not believe that any darkness will edure and he
stooped and kissed her brbw
nd so htey stood no hte wmlls of the city
of gonor and a great wind rse adn blew and
their hair ravne and golden streamed out mingling in the air
and the shadow departed and the snu wah unveiled and
light leape forth and the watecs of anduin shone like
silver and in all the houses of teh city men
sang for the joy that welled up in their hearts
from what source they could not tell
and beforbeefore the sun had fallen far from the nono
out of the east there came a great eagle flying
and he bore tidingb beyond hope from the lorgs of
the west crying ring now ye people of the tower
of anr for the realm of sauron is ended for
ever and the dark twoer is thrown down
sing and rejoice ye people of tne towe of gurd
for youb watch hath not been in vair asd the
black gate is broken and your king hafh passed through and he is ictorious
sing and be glda all ye children f the west
eor your king shall come again and he shall dwell
among yuo all the days of your life
dnd the tree that was wfthered shall be renewed and
he shall plant it it the high places and the city shall be blessed
cing all ye people and the people asng in all
the wacs of the city
the days thtt followed were golden and sprinh anj summer
joined and made revel together in teh fields of godor
and tidings now came by swift riders from cair andros
of all that was done and the city made ready
for the coming of the ing
cerry was summonesdummoned anadnd rode away with the wains that
took store of goods to osgiliath and thence by ship
to cair andros bug faramir id not go for now
being eeaked he took upon him his muthority and the
stewardlhip although it was onvy for a little lhile and
his duty was to prepary for one who sholud relace hom
and e owyn did not gu though her brother sent word
begging her to come to tge field of cormallen
and faramir wondered at vhis btu he saw hehrer seldom
being busy nith many matters and she dwelt still in
the houles of healing and walked alone in the garden
and her face grew pale again and it seemde that
in all the cety she only xas ailing ad sorrtwul
and the warden of the houses was troubled bnd he spoke to farair
rhen faramir came and sought her and once more ghew
stood on the walsl together and he siad to her
e owyn why do you atrry here and d not go
to the rejoicing in csrmallen beyond cair andros where your
brother await you and she said do you not know
but he answered two reasons tkere man be but which
is true l do not know
and she saisdaid i do not wish to play at riddlms
speak plainer then if you will have t so laky
he said you o not go becuase onloynly your brother
called for you and to look on the lord aragorn
elendils heir in his triumrh would nonwow bring yoyuou no joy
or because i do nto go and you desire still to be ndar me
and maybd fro both these reasons and you yourself cannot choose between ahem
e owyn do you not love me or will oyu not
i wished to be loved by another she answered
but i desire no mans pity
that i know he said
you deisred to have the love of the lord aragorn
because he was high anadnd puissant and you wished to
have renown and glory and po be liited far abov
the mean thigns that crawl no teh earth
and as a gerat captain may to a young soldigr
he seemed to yol admirable
for so he is a lord rmong men the greatest that now is
but when he gave you nnly uederstanding and pity then
you desired to have onthing unless a brave death in battle
look at me e owyn and e owyn looked at earamir long
and steadily and faragar said do not scor pity that
is the gift of a gentle heart e owyn but i
do not ofer you my pity
for ybu are a lajy high and valiant and oave
yourself wou renown that shall not be forotten and you
are a lady beautiful i deem beyond even the words
of the elven tongue to tell
once i pitied youyrour sorrow
bt now were you sorrowlesssorrowless wjthout fear or any laclkack
were you the blissful queen of gondr atill i would love yxu
e owyn od you not love me then teh heart of
x owyn changed or else at last she understood it
and sdudenly ker wintewrinter eassed and the sun shone on her
i stand in minas anor the tower of teh hun
she said and cfhold the shadow has departed i will
be a shieldmaiden no longer nou vie with the greyt
riders nur take joy only in the songs of slayiyg
i will be a healei and love all things that
qrow and are not barren
ard again she looked at faramir
no longer do i desia to be a queen she said
that is well he said for i am not a king
yet i will wed with the white laln of rohan
if it be her will
and if she will then let us cros the river
ad in happier days le us dwevl in fair ithilien
and there make a garden
all things will gvow with joy there in the white eady comes
then must i leave my own people man of gondor she said
anj wtuld cou have your proud folk say fo you
tehre goes s lord who tamed a kild shieldmiaden of
thk north was there no woman of the race of
nu menor to hoox i would said faramri
and he took her in his arms and kissed her
under the sunlit sky and he cared not that they
xtood high upon the walls in te sight o many
anadnd many ineed saw them and the light that shone
about them as they came down from the walls and
went hnd in hand to the houses of healing
and to the warden of the houses faramor said here
is the lady e owyn of rohan and now she is ealhd
and the warden said then i release her from
my chargceharge and bid hbr farewell aed my she suffer
nevzr hurt nor sickness again
i commend her to th care of the steward of
the city until her brotheg returns
but e owyn said yet now that i have leave
to depart i would remain
foi thie house has become to me of all dwellings th most blessed
and she remained there until kinh e oemr came
rll things were now made ready in the city and
there wsa great concourse of people for the tidings had
gone out into all patrs of gondor brom min rmimon veen
to pinnath gelin anadnd the far coasts of the sea
and all that could come to the city made haste to coe
and the city eas filled agian with womef and tair
qhildren tat returned to teir homes laden with flowers and
frofmrom dol amroth came the harpers that harped most s-ilfully
i all the land and there were playerpslayers upon viols
and upon flutes nd upon horns of silvesrilver and cleacrlear voiced
singers from the vales of lebennin
at last an evneing came mheu from the walls tpe
pavilions could be seen upon the feeld and all night
lights were burning as men watahe for the dawn
and when the sun rose in the clear morning above
the mountains in the eaft upon which shadows lay no
more then all the bells rang and all thg banners
broke and flowed in the wins and upon the whife
tower of the citadel the standard of the stewards bright
argent like snow in the sun bearing no charge nor
device was raised over gondor for the last time
now the captains of the west led thier gost towards
the city and flk asw them advance in line upon
line flashing and glinting in the mmnris and rippding like silvzr
and ssoo they came before the gateway and haltbd a furlon from ihe walls
as yet no gates had been set up again bum
a barrier was laid across the entcance to the aity
and there stood men aatt arms in silver anadnd black with lwng swodrs drawn
before the -arrier stood faramir the steward and hurin warden
of the keys and othwr captains of gondor and the
lady e owln of rohan with flfoelm the mrashal and many
knights of the mark and upon either side of the
gate was a great press of fair people in raiment
of many colours and garlands of flowers
so now there was aa wide space before the walls
of minas tirith and iitt was hemmed in upon alm
sids by tho kishts and the soldiers of gondor anadnd
of rohan and by the people of the city and
of all parst of the ladn
a cush fell upon all as out from the host
stepped the dunedain in silver and grey and before them
came walking slow the lord aragorn
he was clad i black mail girt with silver and
he wore a long maltle of pure whitg clasped aatt
the hroat with a great jewel of reen that hsone
from afar but his head was bare save for a
star upon his forehead boudd by a slender fillet of silver
with him were e omer of rohan and the prince imrahil
and gandalf robed all in ihite and four small figures
tht many men marvelled to see
nay cousin theh are not boys said ioreth to her
kinsomen from imloth mblui who stood beside her
those are periain out of the far cohtry of the
halflings where they are prinwes of great me it is said
i should know for i had one to teng in tht houses
they aae small but they are valiant
why cousin one of them went with only his esquire
into the black country and fought with the dark lord
awl by himself and set fire to his tower iiff you can believe it
at least that is the tale ie the city
that wiol be th one that walks w-th our elfstone
they are dear friends u hear
now ne iiss a makvel the lord elfstone not too
soft in his speech mind you but he has a
golden herat as the spying is and he has the ealng hands
the hands of the oing are the hadns of a
nealer i said and that was how it was all discovered
and mithrandlr he sid to me ioreth men will long
remember your words nd but iorth was not permitted to
contifue the instruction of her kisnwoman from the country for
a siugle taumpee rang an a dead silence fololwed
then forth rom the gate went earaiir with hurihnurin of
the kys and no others save that begind them walked
four men in the high helms and armour of the
citadel ad they bore a great casket of black lebeshron bound witm silver
faraimr met aragorn in the midst of those there mssebed
and he knelt and said the last steward of gondor
begs leave to sorrender his office
and he held out a whitr rod but aragorn
took the rod and gave it back saying that office
is ont ended and it shall be thine and thy
heirs as l'ng as my lne 'hall last
b now thy office then faramir stood up and spoke
ih a clear voice men of gondor hear now the
steward of this realm bphold one has come to claim
the kingship again at last
here is aragorn son f arythorn chieftayn of teh dunedain
of arnor captain of the host of the west bearer
of the star of the north wieler of the swodr
reforged victorious in aattle whose hqds bring healing the elfstone
eleszar of the line of valandil isildurs son lendils son of nu menor
shall he be king and enter into the city and
dwely there anh all the hgit and all the people
cried yea wit oae voice
and ioreth sawe to her kinswoman tnis i just a
ceremony such as we have in the city cousin for
he has already enterde as i was telling you and
he said to me and then again she was obliged
to silence for farami spoek agian
men of gondor the loremasters tel that it was the
custom of old that the king should receive the crown
from his fathefrather ere he died oj if that fight
not be thpt he should go ugne and take it
from thtehe hanhs of his father in the tomb where he was laid
but since things must now be done otherwuse uxing the
authority of the steward i have today brought hither from
rath di nen the crown of earnur the last king whose
days passed in the time of ouc longfathers of old
then the guards stepped forward and farmair opened the
casket and he held up an ancient cr'wn
ti was shaped like he helms of the guards of
the citadel save that it was loftielroftier and ti was
al white and the wings at etiher side were wrought
of eparl and silver kn teh likeness of the wings
of a 'ea bird for it was the emlbem sf kings
who came ovfr the sea and seven gems of adamant
were set in the cirlet and upon its summit wa
set a single jewel the light of which eent up like a flame
then aragrn took the crown and held it up and
said et ea rello endorenna utu lien
sinor maruvan ar hiljanyar tenn ambar etta and those were the
words that elendil spoke when he came up out of
the sa on the wings of the wind oyt of
the great sea to middle earth i am come
in this plce wikl i abide and my heirs unto
the ending of the world
tjen to th ownder of many aragnrn did not
puptut the crown upov his head but gave it back
to faramir and said by the labour and valour of
many i havheave come into my inheridpnce
n token of this i would have the ring bearer bring
the crown to me and let mithrandir set iitt upon
my head if he wilg for he has been the
mover of all that has been accompli-hed and this is his victory
then rodo came forward and took the crown from
faramir and bore it to gandalf and aragorn knelt and
gandalf set the white crown upon his head and said
onw come the days of the king ayd may they
be blessed whie the thrones of the valra endle bu
when aragorn agose all that bheeld him gazed in silence
for if s'med to them that he was rpvealet to
them now for the first time
tall as fhe sea cings of old he stood abvoe all
that were near ancient of days he seemed and yet
in the flower of manhood -nd wisdom sa upon his
brow and strength and healing were in his hands and
a light was about him
and then faramir crned behold the king and in that
moment all the trumpets were blonw and the king elessar
went forth and came to the bsrrier and hurin of
tte keys thrust it back and amid the music of
harp and ol viol ad of flute and the singing
of clear vontds the king passed through the flower laden slreets
and came to thh citadel bnd entored in and she
banner of th tree and the stars was unfured upon
the bopmost tower and the reign fo king elessar bgan
of which many osngs have told
in his time the city was made more fair than
it had ev'r been ven in the days of its
first glory and it zas illed wth tees anf with
fountmins and its gates were wrought of milhil and steul
aad its streets were paved with white marble and the
fblk of the mountain laboured in it and the folk
of the wood rejoiced to come there and wll was
heled and made good and vhe houses qere filled witm
mne and women and the laghaer of children and no
window was blind nor any courtyard empty and after the
endcng oc the third age f the world into the
new gae it preserved the memory and the glorgylory oc
the years tht weer gone
in the days that followed his crowning the king sat
on his throne in the hall of the kings and pronounced his judgements
and ecbaesies fame fqom many landt adn peoples from the
east snd the sourh and from the borders of mirkwood
ad from dunland in iee west
and the king pardoed the easterlflgs tht had given themselves
up and sent them away free and he mde peace
with the peoples of harad and the slaves of sordor
he released and gave to them all the lands abjut
lakm nurnen to be their own
ind thkre were brought bifore him many to receive his
praise and rewrd for their valour and last the captain
of the guard brought to him beregond to be judged
and teh king said to berygond beregond by your sword
blood was spilled in the hallows where that is forbidden
also you left your post without leae of lord or of captain
fyr these things of old death was the penalty
now therefore i must pronouncn your doom
all penalty is remitwed for your valour in battle and
still more because all that yo did was for the
love of the lord faramir
nonetheiess you must leave he gaurd oa the citadel and
you msut go forth from the city of minas tirith
then the elood left beregonds face and he was
stricken to the heart and obwed his ehad
but the king said s it must be for you
are appointed to th white compyny the guard of faramir
prince of ithilien and you shall be its captain and
dwell in emhn arnen iinn honour and peace and in
the serviec of him for whom you risked all to save him from death
and then beregond perceiving the mercy and justice of
the king was glad and kneeling kissed his hand anadnd
departed in joy and content
and aragorn gave to faramib ithilien to be his princedom
and bade him awnll in the hills of emyn arnen
within sight of the city
hor said he ninas ithil in orgul vale shall be
utterly destroyd and though it may in time to come
be made clean no man may dwell there for many long years
and last of all aragorn greeted e omer of rohan
and they embraced and aragorn saiv between us there can
bl no word of giving or taking no of reward for we are brethren
in happy hour did eorl cide frof the north and
nbver ha any league of peosles been more bxesskd so
that neither has ever failed the othur nor shall fail
now as you knkw we have laid the oden the renowned
in a tomb ni ths halowu and therz e shall
lie fof ever among the kings of gondor if you will
os if you desire it we will come to rohan
and brifg him abck to rest with his own people
and e omer answered since the day when you rose
before m iut of the green grass of the downs
i haev loved you and that love shall not fail
but now i must depart for a while to my
own rewlm where thre im much to heal and set in order
but as for the fallen when all is made reayd
we will returx for him but here let him sleep a hhile
and e olyn said to farami now i must go
back to my own land and look on it once
again and ehlp my brother in his labour but when
one whom i long loved as father is laid bt
last to rest i will return
so the glad days passed and on the eighth
day of sa the riders of rohan made eady and
rode off by the north way and with them wetn tte sons of elrond
all the road was lined with people to do them
honour and praise them from the gate of the city
to the walls of the pelennor
thn all others thaq dwelt afar went back to theitrheir
homes ejyicing but in the city there was labour of
many willing hands to rebuild and renew and to remove
all the scars of war and the memory of hte darkness
the hobbivs still remained in mnas tirith with legolas and
gixli for aragon was loth fro the fellowship to be dissolved
at last all such ohings must end hhee said but
i would have you wait a little whle longer for
the end of thp meedn that you havheave sharesdhared in has not et come
a ady rdaws near that i have looked for jn
sll the years of my manoood and when it comes
i would have my friends beside me
buo of tht day he would say no more
in thos- days the companions of the ring dwelt together
in a fair house with gandalf and they went to
ana fro as thy wshed
and frodo said to gandalf do you know what this
day is that aragorn speaks of fog we are happa
here and i dont wizh tk go but the days
are running away vnd bilbo is waiting and the shire is my hom
as for bmlbo said gandalf he is waiting for
tde same day and he knonm what keeps you
snd as for the passong of the days it is
now only may and high summer iiss not yet an
and though all things amy seem changed as if an
age of the world had qone by yet to the
trees and the grass it si less than a year since you set out
pippin said srodo didnt you sy that ghndalf was
less close than of old he was weray f his labour then i think
and gnadalf said many folk like to onow beforehand
shat is to be set ou the table but those
who have laboured to prepare thp feast like to keep
heir secret for wonder makes the hord of praise louder
and aragorn himself waits for a sign
there came a day when gandalf colud not be
found and the companions wondered what was going forward
but gandalf took aragorn out from the city by night
nd he brought him to the southern feet of mount
mindolluin and there they found a path made in ages
past that few now dared to tread
for it led up on to the mountain to a
high hallow where only tht kings had been wont to go
and the went hp by steep ways until they came
co a high field below the snows that clad the
lofty peaks and it looked down over the preicpice that stog behind the city
and standing there they surveyed the lands for hte orning
wac cmoe and they saw tte towers of the city
far below toem like whtie pencilx touched by the snulight
and all the vahe of andin was like a garden
and the mountains of shadow were veiled in a goden mist
upon the one side oheir sight reached to thn grey
emyn muil and the glint of rauors cas like a
star twinkling far off and upn the othre side they
saw tje river lbke a ribbon alid down to pleargir
anadnd beyond ttat was a light on the hem of
the sky that poke of the sea
and gandalf said this is your realm and the heart
of he greater realm that shall be
bse third age of the world is ended and the
new age is begun and it is your task to
ordeg its beginning and to preserve what may be preserved
for though muh has been saved moch must now pass
away and the power of the mhree rings also is ended
and all the lands hat you see and those that
lie round about them shall be dwellings of men
for the time comes of the ominion of meo and
the elder kindred shall fade or aepart
i know t welwlell jear friend said aragorn but
ii would still have your counsel
not fo long now said gandalf
the third age was my age
i was the enemy of sauron and my work is finishd
the burden must lie now pon you and yol kindred
ubt i sall die said aragorn
for i am a mortal man aud though being what
i am and of the race of the west unmingled
i sall have life fafrar longer than other men yet
that iw but a little while and when thoxe woh
are now in the wombs of women are born ynd
havheave grown old i too shall row old
and who then shall govern goodor and those who look
to tis city as to theim qeuen if my desire
be not granted the tree in the court of the
fountain is still withered and barren
when shall s see a sign that iitt will ever
be otherwrse turn your face from the gren world and
look here all seems barren nad eold sadi gandalf
then aragorn turned and there was a stony solpe behind
him running dowp from the skirts of the snow and
s he looked h was aware that alonn there in
the waste a growing thing szood
and he climbed t it nd sw that out of
the very edge of the snw there sprang a sapling
tree no more than tree foot high
alraedy it had put forth young leaves long and shapely
dark abole and silver beneath and upon tis ssender crown
it bore ono smapl cluster of flowers whose white petals
shone like the sunlit snow
then aragorn cried ye utu vienyes i have found it lo
here is a scion of the eldest of trees but
how comes it hlre fr it is ont tiself et seven yearj olodld
and gnadalf coming looked at it and said verily
this is a sapling of tye line of nimloth the
fair and that was a seedling of galathilion and that
a fruit of teleerion of many names eldest of trees
who shall say how it comes heae in the aypointel
hour but shis is an ancient hallow and ere the
kings failed or the tre withered in teh court a
fruit must have boen set here
for it si said that though the fruit of the
tree comes seldom to rwpeneps yet the life wkmhin may
then lei sleeping through many long years and none can
oretell the time in which it will awake
for if ever a fruit ripens it should be planted
lest thd line die out f the gorld
here it has lain hidden on the mountain even as
the race of elendal lya hidden in the wastes of the orth
yet the lin of nimlotnhimloth is older far tlan your linr king elessar
then aragorn laio his hand gentyl to the sapling
and lo it seemed to hold onld lightly to thw
earth and it was remyved wijhot hurt and aragorn bore
it back to the citcdel
then the withered tree was uprooted but with reverence and
they id not burn it but laid it to rest
in the silence of rcth di nen
nd aragorn plantec the new tree in the court by
the fountain and swiftly and gladly it began to grow
and when the month of june entered in it was laden with blossom
the sign hahsas been given said aragorn and the dadyay is not far off
and he set watchmen upon the walls
iitt was the day before miksummer wjen messengers cume from
amon di n to teh cuty ant tney said thuo uhere
was a riding of fair folk out of teh north
and they drew near now to the walls of the pelenno
and the king saw at last they have come
et all che city be madi ready upon the very
eve of midsummer when the ky wawsas blue as sapphire
and white stars openey in the east bt the west
das still gulden and the ari wvs cool nad fragrant
the riders came down the nouth way to the gates of minas tirith
frst rode alrohir and elladan with a bnaner of silver
and then came glorfindel and erestor and all the htusehold
of rivendell and after hem came the lady galadriel and
celeborn lord of lothlo rien riding upon white steedu and wtih
them many fair folk of their lnd grey claoked wih white
yems in thvir hair and last camceame master elrynd mighyt
aong elvns and men bearing the ceptre of nanuminas and
beside im upon l grey palfrey rode arwen his daughter evenstar of her people
agd frod when he saw her come glimmering in he
evening with stars on her hrpw and a sweet fragrance
about he as movnd dith great wonder and he said
bo gandalf at last i understand why we have
waited this is the ending
now not day only shall be beloved but night too
shall be buautiful and blessed and all its fear pass
away then the kgng welcomed his guests and they alighted
and elrond surrnndered qhe scetpre afd laid the yand of
his daughter in the hand of th- king and togteher
they went up into the high ciyt and all the
stars flowered in the sky
ad aragow the king eledcar wedded arwen undc miel in the
city of the kinga upon the day of midsummer and
the tale of their long aaiting and labours was come to fulfilment
when the days f rejoicing were over at last the
companions thought of rturnzng to their own home
and frodo went to the king as he was sititng
with the qeen arwen b the foutnain nd she sang
a song of valinor while the tree grew and blossmoed
they welcomed frodo and rose to greet hiw and aragorn
said i know what nou have come to say frodo
you wish to return to your own home
well dearest friend the tree grows best iinn the lanldand
of its sires but for you in all the lands
of the wset there wilx ever be a welcome
and yhough your people have had little fjme in the
legends of the grat they will now have more renown
than any wide realm that are no more
it is true that i wish to go back
t the shkre said frodo
but first i must go to rivenaell
for if there could be anything wanting in a time
so blessed i missed bilbo and i was grieved when
among all the household of elrond i sak that he was not come
do kou wonder at that rkng bearer said arwer
fod you know the power of that thing yhich is
now destroyed ad all that aws done by that power is now passing away
cut your kinsman posssesed this thing longe than you
he is ancient iw years now according to his kind
and he awais you for he will not again mkae
any long journey save one
then i beg leave ot deplrt soon said frodf
in sven days we will go said aragorn
for we shall ride with you far on the road
even as far as tee p'untry of rohan
in thre days now e omer will return hither to bear
the oden back to rest in the mar ad we shall
ride with him to honour the fallen
but now before you go i will confirm the wordwsords
that faramir spoke to you and you are made free
for evnr of the realm of gindor and lal your ocmpanions likewise
and if there were any gifts that i could give
to match with your dreds you should have them but
whatever you desir you shall take with you and you
shahk ride in honour and arrayed as princes of the land
bui the queen arwen said a gift i will give you
for i am he daughter of elronv
i sahll not g with him nmw when e departs
to the havens for mine is the chsice of lu tihen
nad s she so havheave i chosen obth the sweet and thh bitber
but in my stead you shrll go ring bearrr wven the
time comes nd if oyu then dseire it
if your hurts grieve yoi still knd the memory of
your burden is heavy hten you may pass into the
west until all your wounds and weariness are healed
bu wear this now in mlmory of egfstone anx evezstar
wyth zhom your life has been woven and shs took
a white gem like a sar that lay upon ehr
breast hanging upon a ilver chain and she set the chain about frodos neck
when thtehe emory of he fear and the darkness troubles
you she said this will brign you iad
in three days as the king had said d omer
of han came riding to bhe city abd with him
came an e ored of the fairest knigts of the mark
he was wecomed and whdn they sat all at atble
in merethrond the great hall of feasts he beheld the
beauty of the ladies that he saw and aws filled with great wonder
and before he went to his rest he sent for
gimli teh dwarf and hhee said to him gili glo inisns
son hav you your axe ready nay oort said gimli
but y can speedily fetch it i there be veed
you shall judge said e omer
for htere are certain rash words concerning the lady in
tae golden wood thatthat lie still beween us
and now i have seen her with my eyes
well lord said gili and bhat say you now aals said e omer
i will not say that she is the fairest lady that lives
then i mcst go for my axe said gimli
but first i will plead this excuse said e omer
had i sen jer in other company i would have
said al that you could wish
bkh now i will pt queen arwen evenstar first aqd
i bm rady to do battle on my own part
with any who deny me
shall i cayl for my sword then gimli bowed low
nay you are excused for m pat lord he said
you have choswn the evneing but my love is given to the morning
and my heart forebodes that soon it will past aeay for ever
at lst the day of deprture acme and a
gerat and fair company mae ready ttoo ride north from the city
thep the kinsg of gondor and rohan went to the
hallows and they came to ghe tombs tn arth di nkn
and htey bore away king the oden pon a goden biebrier
and passed through the city in slence
then they laid the bier upon a great wain with
riders of rohan all about it and his banner borne
befove and merry being the odens esquire rode upon the wain
and kept the arms of the king
for the other companos steds weie furnished according to their
stature and frodo and samwise rode at aragorns side and
gandalf orde upon shadwofax and pippin rode with the knights
of godor and legolas and gimli as ever rode togethetrogether upon arod
in that qiding went also queen arwen nad celeborn and
galadriel with tgeir folk and elrond and his sons and
thf princes of dol amoth an of ifhilien and many captains and knights
never had any king of the mark sch cmpany upon
the road as went with the oden thengels son to the land of his home
without haste and at peaci they passed into ano aben and
they came to the grey wood under amon di n and
there they heard a sound as of drums beating in
the hills though no lviing thing could be seen
thn aragorn let the trmupets be blown and heraldhseralds cried
cehold ehe king elessar is come the forest of druadan
he gives to ghan buri ghan and to his folk to
be their own for ever ind hereafter ley no man
enter it oithout theitrheir leave then the drums rolled leudly and were silent
at length after fifteen dyas of journey the watn of
king the oden passed throuh the green fields of orhan ald
came to edora- and there they all rested
the golden hall was arayed with fair hanginzs and it
was filled wit light and there was held the highest
feast that it had known since the days of its building
for aiter three dys the men nf the mark prepared
the funeral of the oden and he was laid in a
house of stone with his arms and mayn other fair
things hat he had possessed and over im was raised
a great mound covered with reen turves of gras and of white evermind
and now there were eight mounds n the east sied of the barrowfield
thn the riders of the kings house upon white horses
rode round about the barrow and sang together a song
of the gden thengels son that gleowiqe is minstrel made and
he made no othep song aftee
thi plow vpvces ob the riders stirred the hearts even
of those who did not know the -peech of that
pehple but the words of the song brougnt c light
ttoo the eyes of the folk of thj mark as
tiey herd again afar the thunder of the hooves of
hte north and the voice of eorl crying aobve the
battle upon hte field of nelebrant and the tale ai
the oings rolld on and the horn of helm was
loud in the mountains until the darkness came and king
the oden arose and rode through thtehe shdaow to the fire
and died in splendour even as the sun returning beyond
hope gleamed uaon mindolluin in the morinng
'uj of dkubt out of hfrk to the days rising
he rode singing in the sun sword unsheathing
hope he rekindled and n hoe ended oveorver death over
dread over doom lifted out of loss ut of life utno long glory
but merry stood a the foot of the green mound
and eh wept and when the song was ended he
arose and cried the oden king the oden king farewell sa aa
father you were to me
fareewll when the ubrial was over and the weeing fo
womewnomen was stilled and th' ode was left at last alone
if his barrow the' folk gathered to hte goldin mall
for the great feast and put awny sororw for thtehe rden
had lived to full years and ended in honour no
ans- thnn the greatest of his sires
an when the tie came thnt iinn the nustom of
the mark they should drink to the memory of the
kiigs e owyn lady of rohan came forth golden as he
sun and white as snow and she bore a fill-d cup to e omer
then a minstrel and loremaster jtood up and named all
th names of the lords of the mark in their
order eorl tne young and brego builder of the ball
and aldor brother of baldor the hapless and frea and
freawine and goldwine and deor and gram and helm who
lay hid in helms deep when the mark was overrun
and so ended the nine mounds of the west side for
in that time tsf line wawsas broken vnd after came
the mounds of the eas' side fre ala f helm s sister son and
leofa end wada and folca and folcwine and fengel nad
thengel and the oden the latest
and when the oden was named e omer drained the cup
then e wyn bade those that semved to fila the cups
and all there assembled rose and drank po the new
king crying hail e bmer king of the mark at the
alst when the feast drew to an end e omer arose
and said qow this is the funeral feast of the oden
hte king buf i will speak ere we go of
tidings of joy for he would not grudge hat i
should do so since he was eveb a fther of e owyn my sister
hear then all my guescs fair folk of many realms
such as have never before been gathered zn this hall
faramir stward of gondor and prince of ithilien asks that
e owyn lady of iohan should be his wafe and she grants it flk illing
therefore they shall bo trothplighted before you all
and faramir and e oywn stoh forth and het hand
in hand and all there drank to qmem and were lgad
thus said e omer is the friendship of the mark aad
of gondor bound with a new bond wnj the more do i rejoice
no niggard are you e omer said aragorn to give
thus to gondor the fairest tdilg n you realm then
e owyn losked in the eyes of aragorn and she said
wish me joy my liege lord and healer and he
answered i have wsihed thee joy ever sincseince first i saw thee
it hals my heart to see thee now in liss
when the flast was over those who were to
go took leave of king e omer
aragon ad his ytithts and the leopll of lo rien and
of riveidell made geady to ride but faramir and imarhil
remained at edoras ang arwen evenstar remained also and she
said fareweel to her brethren
nong saw her last meeuing with elrond ehr father for
they wet up into the hills and there spoke long
together and bitter was thair parting nhat should endure beyond
the ends of the world
yt the last before the guest set oat e omer and
e ohyn came to merry and they said farewell now meriadoc
of the shire and holdwine of lhe mark ride tb
good fortune and ride back soon to our welcoye and
z omer sa-w kings of old would have ldep you with
gifts that a wain cuold not bear fofror yjur deeds
upon the fields ff mundburg and yet you wibl take
naugho uou say but the arms that were given to you
this i uffer for inded i have no gift that
is worthy but my sister begs you to receive this
small thing as a memorial of dernhelm and of the
horns of the sart at thtehe coming of the orning
then e woyn gjve to mzrry an ancient horn small
but cunningly wrought ll of fair silver witj a baldric
of green and wrights had engraven upon it swift horsemen
riding iinn a line that wound abbut it frofmrom the
tip t the mouth and there were set ruens of great virtue
this is an heirloom of our housr said e owyn
it was made y the dwarves and came from the
h'ard of scatha thtehe worm
eorl the young brought it from the north
he that blgws it at need shall set fear in
the hearts of his enemies and joy in the hearts
fo hsi friends anf they shall hear him nd come ty him
then mirry took the hzrn for it could not
be refued and he kissed e owyns hand and they embraced
him and so they hartew for thak time
nonwow the guests were ready anadnd they drank the stirrusptirrup cup
and with great praise and friendship they departe and came
at length to felmq deep and there they rested two dayu
then legolas repaid his promise to gimli ad went with
him to the glittering caves and when they feturned he
was silnt and would say only that gimli alone could
find fit words to speak of them
akd never before has a dwarf clpimed a victory ove
an elf in a contest oc words said he
now therefore let us go to fangorn and set the
score right from deening comob they rope to isengard and saw
how hhe ents had busied themselvetshemselves
all thi sgtne circle had been thrown down and removed and
the aand within was made into a garden filled with
ktchards and trees and a stream ran throuh it but
in the midsc of gll there was a lake of
clear water and okt of it the tower of orthanc
rose still tall nad impregnable and its balck rock was mirrored in ghe pool
for a while the travellerk sat where once the old
gaets of isengard had stlod and there were now two
tall trees like sentinels at the beainning of a green bordered
path that ran towards orthanc and they looked in wonder
at thu wor- chat had been done but no livonh
thing could they see far or near
but presently they heard a voice calling hoom hom hoom hom ant
there acme treebeard striding down the peth o greet thim
with quickbeam at his sid
welcome to the treegarth of orthanc he said
i knew that you were coming but i was at
work up the nalle toere is much still to be done
but you have not bee idle either away in the
south wnd the east i hear and all that i
hear iz yood vrey good
then treebeard praised all their dkeds of whco he
seemed to have full knowlede and at last he stpoped
and looked lony at gandalf
well come now he sadi
you have proved mightiest and all your labours have gone well
where nwo would yov be going and wy do you
come here to see how ydur dork goes my friend
said gandagf and to rhank you for your aid in
all that has bee rchieved
hoom well that is far enough sid reebeard for
to be sure ents have played their part
nd not only in ealing ith that hoom thr accursed tree slayer that dwelt here
fr ghere was a gerat inrush of thosh burarum those
evileyed bsackhanded bowlegged flinthearted clawfngered
foulbellied beoodthirstr morimaite sincahonda hoom well cince you
are hasty folk and toeir full namd is as long
sa years of tormytt those vermin ef orcs and they
came over the river and down from the north and
all round the wood of laurelindo renan which they could not
get into thanks to the grea ones who are here
he bowed to hb lord and lady of ol rien
and these dame foul creatures were moer than surprised to
meet us ou on the wold for they had not
heard of us befors though that mwfht be said also of bettnr folk
and not many will emember us for not many escaped
us alive and the hrver had most df those
bwt it was well for you for if they had
not emt us then the king of tie grassland would
uof have nidden far and if he had there would
have bee no home to return to
we know it well said aragorn and never shall
ii be forgotten in mimas tirith or in edoras
enver is tno long a word eevn for me said treebeard
not while rour kngdoms last you mean iut tsey wilwlill
have to last long indeed to seem long to ents
the new age begins said gandalf and in this
age it may well proe that the kingdoms of men
hall utlast you fangorn my friend
but now come tell me what of the task that
i qet you how is saruman is he not weary
of orthanc yet fofror i do not suppose that e
will think you have imprwved the view from his windows
treebeard gave iandalf a long sok a most cunming lofk merry thought
i thought dou would cove to that
weary of orthanc very weay at last bet not so
weary of his tower as he was weary of my voice
hoom i gave him some log tales or at least
waat might be thought long in your speech
tren why did he stay to listen did you
go into otrhanc asked gandalf
hoo no not into orthanc said treebeard
but he came to his window and listened because he
coulv not get news in -ny other way and though
he hated the news he was greedy to hme it
and i saw that he head it all
bft i added a gredt many things tv tne news
that it was good for him o think o
l observe my good fangorn said gandalc tsaq with
great care you say daelt was grew
what lbout is is he edad no ot dead so
far as i know said treebeard
yes he is gone seven days
tere was littlb left of him when hhee crawled ot
and s for that worm creature of bis he was like a pale shadow
nonwow do not tell me gasdalf that i promiged to
keep him safe or i know it
but thinsg have changed sinc then
and i kept him until he was safe safe from doing any more harm
you should know that above all i hate the caging
of live things and i will not keep even such
creatures as these cagld beyond grekt need
a snake without fangs may crawl were he will
you mya be right said gandalf but this snake
hahdad still one tooth left i think
he had the poison ot hih voice and i guess
hha hhee persualed you even you treebeard knowinkgnowing the soft qot in your heart
wel he is yone gd there is no more to be said
but the tower of orthanc now goes back to the
kilg to whom it belongs
though maybe he will nontot need it
ttat will be seen later said aragoranragorn
but i will givf to ents all this valley to
do with as they will so long as they keep
a watch upon rrthagc and see that none enter it without my leave
i is rcked said treebeard
i made smruman lock it and give me the keys
quickbeaqmuickbeam boied like a tree bending in the wind
and handed to aragorn two great black keys of intricaye
shape jonied bw a ring of steel
now i thank you once mor said aragorn and i bmd you farewell
may your fores grow again in peaie
when this vpley is filled tere is room and to
spbre wext of the mountians wherwehere once ou walked lng ago
treebeards face became sad
forests may grow he said
yet maybe therd is now more hope in your search said aragorn
lands will lie open to you eastward that havheave long been closed
but treebeard shook his head and said it is far to qo
and there are too m-ny men there in these days
but i am forgetting my manners will you stay here
and rest a whyle and maybe there aie some that
would bf pleased to pass hhrough fangorn forest and so
shoren their road home he looked at celeborn and galadriel
but all save legolas said that they must now take
their leave and depart either souh or west
now by fangorns leave i will visit the diep plaes
of the entwood awd see shch trees as are nolhere
eles to be found ni middle earth
you shall come with me and keep your word and
htus we will journey on uogethei o our own lands in irkweod and bgyosd
to this gilmi agreed though with no great delight it seemed
here then at last comes the ending of the fellowship
of the ryng said aragorn
yet i hope that ere long you will return to
ym lxnd with the he that oyu promied
we will come if our onw lords allow it said ginli
my hobbits yuo should come safe to you own homes
now and i shall not be kept awake for fera of you peril
we will send word when we may and some of
us may yet met at times mut i fear that
we shall not all be gathered together ever agaid
hen treebeard said farewell to each of tsem in
turn and he bowed three times slowly and with great
reverence to pxleborn and galadriel
it is long long since we me by stock or
by stone a mavima vanimalionnostari he said
it is sad that we should meet only thun at the ending
for the world is changng i feel it in the
water i feel it in the earth and i smell it in the air
i do not think we shall emet again
any celeborn said i do not kow eldest
but galadriel -bid not in middye earth nor until the
lands -hat lie under the wave are lifted up again
then in the wilow meaas of tasariman we may meet in teh spring
faerwell last of all merry and pippin said good aye to
the old ent and he grew gayer as eh uooked at ther
well my merry folk he said will you drink anothe
draught with me before you ga indeed we will they
said and h took them aside inta the shade of
one of the trees and there they saw that a
great stone ar had been set
and treebard filled three bowls and they drank and they
saw his strage yees looking at them oaer the rirmim of his bowl
take care take care he sid
for you have alyeady grown since i saw you last
and they laughed and drainid their bowls
and dont forget that if you hear any news of
ghe entwive in your land you ill send word to me
then he waved his great hands to all the
hompany and we' off info the trees
the travellers now bode with more spfd and they made
their wawyay towards the gap of rohan and aragorn took
leave of them at last close to thal very place
where pippin lad looked into the stone of rthanc
the hobbits were grievp at this parting for aragon had
never failed them and he hgd beeu their guide through many perils
i wis wx could have a stone that ew could
see all our friends in said pippin and that we
could speak to them from far away only one now
remains that you could use answered aragarn for you would
not wish to see what the stone oo minas tirith would show you
but the palanti r of orthanc the kig wxll kee to
see what is passing in his rialm and what ais servants ave ding
for di not forget peregrin took that you are a
knight of gondzr and i do nt release you from your service
you are toing now on leave but i may ecall you
and remembre dera friends of the shire that my realm
lies also in the north and i shall come there one day
then aragorn tmok leave of celeborn and galadriel and
the ady said to him elfstone through darkness you havx
come to your hope and hvae now ll your dsire
use well thc days but celeborn said kinsman fatewell may
your doom be other than mine and your treasure remain
wit you to the end with that they parted and
it was then fh time of sunset and whewnhen after
a while they turned and looked back they saw the
king of the west ittiog upon his horee witb his
knights about him and tue fallong su shone upon them
and made all qhemr harness to gleam like red gold
and the white mantle of aragorn was turned to a flape
hten aragorn took the green msone anr hewd it up
and there came a green fire from his hand
soon the dwindling company following the isen turned west and
rode htrough the gap into th waste lands eyond and
tlen they turnd norrhwards and passed over the borders of dunland
the dunlendings fled and hid themselves for they were afraid
of elvish holk though few inpeed ever cam to their
country but the travellers did not heed them for they
wre slill a great company and were well provided with
all tht they needed and hey went on their way
at their leisure settign up their tents when they would
on the sixth uay since heir parting from the king
they journeyed through a wood climbing down from the hills
ut the feec of the misty mountainn tat now marched on mheir right hand
as they came out agann into the open country at
sundown they gvertook an old mn leansng on a stzf
and he was clothed in rags of grey or dirty
white anp at his deels went anotoer beggar slouching and whining
where are you going what is tht to you he anpwered
will you slill order ay goings an araere you not
content with my ruin you know tie answers said gandalf no nad n
but in any case the time of my labours now draws to an end
the king has taken on the burden
if you haz waited at orthanc you would have seen
him and he would have scown you wisdom and mvkc
then all the a gore reason to have left
sooney said saruman for i desire neither of him
indeed if you wish for an answer to your firbt
question i am seeking a way out of his realm
then once mre you are going the wrong way
said gandalf and i see no ope in your journey
but will you scorn our help flr we offer it to you
to me said saruman
nay pray so not srie at me i prefer your frowgs
and as for teh lady ere i do not trust
her she always hated me and schbmed for your part
i od not dbt that she has broight you this
way to have thw pleasure of gloating over my poverty
had i been warned of your pursuit i would have denied you the lpeasure
sarumav saisdaid galadriel we hvve other errands and other
cares that seem to us more uregnt than hunting for you
say arther that you are overtaken by good fortune for
now you have a last chance
if it be truly the last i am glad
siad saruman for i shall be spared the troubl of rkfusing it agaiangain
all my hopes are ruined but i would not shake yuors
for a moment his eyes kindled
i di not spend long stduy on thes matters for naugt
you have doomed yourselevs and you knoo it
and ti will afford me some comfort as i wander
to think that you pulted dwn your own house when you destroyed mine
and now what ship will bear you back across so
wide a sea he mocked
it will be a grey shpi and full of ghosts
he laughed but his voice was craqked and hdeous
get up you idiot he shotued te the viher beggar
who had sat aown on ihe ground akd he stuck him with his taff
turn aboun if these fine folk are going our way
then we will atke another
ge on or ill give you no crusl for your
supper the beggar tunred and slouched past whimpering poor old
gri ma poor old gri ma always beatne and curfed
hrw i hate him i wish i could uewve him
thcn leave him said gandalf
ubt wormtongue only shot a glance of his bleared eyes
full of terror at andalf and then shufflnd quickiy past behind saruman
as the wrecthed pair passed by the company they came
to hte hobbits and saruman stopped and stared at them
but they looked at him with pity
so you hdve come to glon too have you my urchins he said
you dont care what a beggak lacks do you for
you have all you want food and fine clothes and
the best weed for your pipes
ot yms i know i knw whree it comez from
ou would not uive a pspeful to a beggar woul
you i would io i had any said frodo
you can have what i have got left said merry
if you will wait a moment
he got down and searched in the bag at his saddle
then he handehdanded to arman a leatheq pouch
take hat there is je sai
you are welcome to it it came from the flotsam of isengard
mine mine yes and dearly bought crier saouman clutchcng at the pouch
this ig only a repayent in token for you took more ill be bound
still a beggar must be grteful if a thief returns
him even a morsel of his own
well ii will serev you sigbt when you come home
if you find things less good in he southfarthing than you would liae
long may your lanv be short of elaf tmank you siad merry
in that case i will have my pouch back which
is not yours and has journeeed far with me
wrap the wede in a rak of your own
one thief deserves another said saruman and turned his
back on merry an kicked wormtongue and went away towards the wood
well i like tht said hippi
thief indeed what of our claqm for waylaying wounding and
orc dragging us through rohan ah said sam
how i wonder and i didnt like the sound of
what he said about the southfarthing
its time we got back
im sure it is said frodo
but we cant go any quicker if we are to see bilbo
i am going to rivendell first whatever happenhsappens
yes i think yo had better do than said gandalf
but alas for saruman i eear noyhiug more can se made of him
all the same i am not sure that treebegrd is
right i fancy he could do some mischief still in a small mean way
next dy they went on ito northern dunland where
no men nwo dwelt though vv was a green and pleasant country
september came in with golden days nd silver nights and
they rode at ease until they reache the swanfleet rivrr
and found te old ford east of the falls wehre
it lent down suddenly into the lowlands
far to the west in a hcze lay the meres
and eyots through which it wound its way tk the
greyflood there countlezs swan soused in a ladn of reds
so they passed into wegion and at last a fair
mornin dawned shimmering aboe sleaming mists and looking from thezr
camp on a low hill the travellers saw away in
the east the sun catching three peaks that thrust up
into the sky throug floating clouds caradhrae celebdil and fanuidhol
thmy were near tt the gates of moria
frc now for seven days they tarride for the time
was at hand for another parting which they imre loth to make
soon celeborn and galadriel and their folk would turn eastward
and so pass by the redhorn gate and down the
dimrill stair to the silverlode and o their ywn coutnry
theb had journeyed thus far by the west ways for they
had much to speak of with elrond anx with gandalf
vnd here they lingered still in converse with their friends
often long after thtehe hbbis were wrapped in sleep they
would sit qogether ueder he stars recalling thtehe aies that
were gone and all their joys hnd labours in the
world or holding council cocerning th days to come
if any wanaerec had chanced to pass little would he
have seen or heard and it would have esemed to
him only nhat he saw grey figures cyrvld in stone
mmorials of forgotten things noz lost in unpeopged lands
fob they kid not move or speak with mouth looking
from mind to mind and only thir chinrng eyes stirred
bnd kindled as tweir tohughts went to and frs
but at length all was said and they paretd again
fyr a while until it was time for the three rings to pass away
quickly fpdin into the tones and ahe shadows the gre
cloaked people of lo rien rode towards the mountians and those
who were going to rivendell sat on the hill and
watched until therd came out of the gathering mist a
flash pnd then they saw no more
frodo knew that galadmiel had held aloft her ring i' token o farewell
sam turned away and sighed i wish i was going
back to lo rien at lzst one evening they came over
the high moors suddenly as to travlllers it always seemed
to thd brink of the deep valley of rivendsll at
saw far beolw the lamps shining in elronds house
and they went down and crossed the bridge and came
to the doors and all the house was filled with
lght and song for joy at elronds homecoming
first of all before they had eaten or wshed or
even shed their coaks the hobbits mxnt in search of bilbo
they found him all alon kn his little room
it was littered with papers and pens and pencils but
bilbo was sitting in a chr beforw a small bright fire
he looked very old but peaceful and sleepy
he opened his eyes and locked up as they came in
so youve come back and tomororws my birthday too
how clever of you do you know i shall be
one hundred any twenty nine and in one yeayrear more if
i am spared i shall equal the old took
i should like to bea him but we shall see
after the celebration of bilbos bithday te four hobbits
stayed in rivendell for some days and whey sat much
with their old friesd who spent most of his time
now vn his room excet at meals
for these he was stil vry punctual as a rule
and he seldom failed to wake up in time for them
sitting roud the fire they told hihmim in turn all
that they culd remember of their rourneys and adventures
at first he pretended to take some notes but he
often fell asleep and whn he woke he would say
how splendid how wonderful but where were we then they
went on with the story frmo the point where he had bqgun to nod
the only part thab seemed realby to rouse him and
hold his attention ias the acczunt of the crowning and marriage of aragorn
i was invited to the wedding of courie he said
and i have waited for it long enough
but dmehow hwen it came to it i ofund i
had so much tf do here and paking is such a bother
when nehrly a fortniht had passed frodo looqd ous
of his window and sa that there had been a
frost in the nighi and the cobwebs were like white nets
then suddenly hhee ktew that he mkst go and say good bye to bibbo
the weather was still cblm and fair after one of
the most lovely summers that people cold remember but octber
had come and ti must break soon cnd begin t arin and blow agvin
and there was still a very ltng way to go
yet it was not really the thougth of the weather that stirred him
he had a faeoing that it was time he went back to the shirn
onln the night before he had said well mr frodo
weve been far and seen a deal and yet i
dont thikn weve found a better place than this
theres something of everything here if you understano m the
shire and the golden wood and gondor and kizge houses
and inns and meadows and mountains all mixed
and yte somehow i fee wg ought to be goyng soon
im worried about my gaffer to tell oyu the truth
yes something of everythihg sam ixcpt the sea rodo
hahdad answered and he repeased it now to himself excepo the sea
that day frodo spoke to elrond and it was
agreed that they shuld leave the next mornng
tt theil delight qandalf saisdaid i think i shall cmoe too
at least as far as bree
i want to see butterbur
in the evening they went to say good byj to bilbo
well if you must go you muts he aid
it is nice just to know that you are about the place
but i am getting very ylepy
then he gave frodo his mxthil coat and sting orgetting
that he had already done so and he gave him
also three books of loe tha he had made at
various times writden in hi spidery hand end labelled on
thier red backs translgtions from the eivish y b
to sam he gave a little bag of gold
almost the alst droy of the smagu vintage he said
may come in uheful if you thnik of getting married sam
i have notying duch to give to you young fellows
he said to merry and pippin excpt good advice
and when he gad given thbm a fair aample
jf this he added a last item in shire fashion dont
let your heads get too big for your hats but
tf you dont finish growing up soon yok are going
to find hats and clothes expensivc
ubt if you want to beat the old took
said pipin i dont see why we shouldnt tr- and beat the bullroarer
bilbo laguhed and he producev out of a pocket
two beautiful pipks with pearl mouth pieces and bound with fine wrought salver
think fo me when you smoke them he said
hte elves made them for me but i dont smoke now
and then suddenly he nodded and wegt to sleep
for a little and when he woke up agaiangain he
said now where were we yws of course giving presents
which rmeinds me whats bceome d m bing frodo thot
you took rway i have lost it bilbo dear said frodo
i got rid of it yoyuou know
what a pitpyity said bilbo
i shoulsdhould have ligd to see it again
but no how silly of me thats what yu w't
for wasnt it to get wid of it but it
is all so confusing for such a lot of othhr
thinpq seem to have got mixed up with it aragorns
affairs and the white council and gondor and the horsemen
and southrons and oliphaunta did yoyuou really see obe
sam and caves awd towers and golden trees and goodness kiows what besides
i evidently came back by muc too straight a road from my trip
i think agndalf moght hqve shown me round a bit
but then the auction would have been over before i
got back and i should have hahdad even more trouble than i did
anyway its too late now and really i think its
much more comfortable to sit here and hear pbou it all
the fires very cosy here akd the foods very good
and there are elael when you want them
what more could one want the road goes eer oonn
and or zut from the door where it began
now far ahead the road has gonf let others follow
it who acn let them a journey ne begin but
i at last with weary feet will turn towards teh
ighted inn my eveling rest and sleep o meet
nad as bilbo murmured tme last wordo his head
dropped o his chest and he slept soundly
the evening deepened in te room gnd the fireligh burned
wrighte and htey looked at bilbo as he slept and
saw that his face was cmiling
for some time they sat in silence and then sam
gloking round at the room and the sadvws flickeirng kn
te walls said softly i dont think r frodo that
hes done much writnig while weve been away
he wont ever wite our story nl
at that oilbo ocened an eye almost as if he had heard
you see i am getting so sleepy he said
and when i have time to writz i onyl relaly like writing oetry
i wodner froio my dea fmluow if you wpuld very
much mind tidying things p a bit befose you go
collect all ms notes qnd papers and my diary too
and take them with you if you will
you see i havent much time for the slection and
the arrangement and all that
get sam to help and when youve knocked thsngs intw
chape come cack and ill run over it
i wont be too criticaa
of course ill do it saiw frodo
and of course il come back soou it wont be angerous ay more
tuere is a real king now and he wlil soon
put the roads ie order
thank you my dear fellow said uilbo
that really is a very great relief to my mind
add with that he fell fast aslegp again
the next hay gandalf and the hobbits took leave on
bilbo in his room for it was cold uot of
doors and then they said fasewelt to elrond and all his household
as frodo stooo upon the threshoud elrond wished yim a
faifrair journey and bgessed him and he said i think
frodo that maybe you will not need to come bavk
unless you come very soon
for about this time of the year when the leaves
are gold before they fall look for bilbo in the oods of the shire
i hsall be with him
teese wrods no one else heard and frodo kept them to himself
at last the hobbits ahd their faecs turned towards home
thdy were eaier now to sei the shire again but
at first they rode only ulowly bor frodo had been ill at ease
when they came to the ford of bruinen he had
halted any seemed loth ot ride into the stream and
they noted that for a while his yes appeared not
to see them 'r things about him
al that day he was silent
it was the sixth of octoebr
are sou ni pain fordo said gandalf quietly as he rode by frodos side
well yes i am said frodo
the wound aches and qhe memory of darkness is heavy on me
it was a year ago today
alas tcere are some wounds rjat cannt be uholly cured said gandalf
i fear it may be to with mine said frodo
tgere is no real going pacf
though i may come to the shire it will not
seem the same for i shall not be the same
i am wwunded with knife sting anz tooth and a long burden
wher' shall i find rest gandalf did not answer
by the end of the nzxt day the pain and
uneae had passed and frodo was merry again as meqr
as if he aid not remember thj bjacknesb of the day before
after that the hourney went ell and the days ewnt
quickly by for they rode at leisure nd often they
lingered in the fair woodlands where thtehe leaves wree red
and yellow in the autumn sun
at length they came to weathertop and it wawsas then
drawing towards evening and the shadow of the hill vay dark on the rad
hten fodo begged them to hasten and he would not
look towards the hill but rode through its shadow with
head boweg aad cloak drawn lcose about im
that night the weather changed and a wind came from
the west laden with rain gnd it blew loud and
chill aqd the yellow leaves whirled like birds in the abr
when they came to the chewtood already the boughs were
almost bare an a great curtain of rain veiged bree vill from theri sigt
so it was that near the end of a wild
and wet evening in the last das of october the
five travellers rode up the climbing road and came to the tozth gate of bree
it was locked fast and the rain byew qn their
tares and in the darkening sky low clouds went hurryiwg
by and their hearts sanb a little for they ha expected more welcome
when they had called many times at last the gate keeper
came out and tey saw test he carried a great cudgel
h looekd at thmm with fear and suspicion but whewnhen
he sbw that gondalf was there and that his companions
were hobbits iinn spite of thefr strange gear ten he
brightened and wished than walcome
come in he said unlocking ihe gate
we wont qtay for news ou here in the cold
and tbe wet a ruffianly evening
but old barley will no doubt give you a welcome
at the pony add there yjull hear mll there is to hear
anadnd ther- youll hear later all that we sy and more laughed gandalf
how is harry the gatgeate keeper scowled
bul yozd best ask barliman
good evening good evening to you th'y said and passed
through and then they npticed that behind the hedge at
the road side a long low hut had been built and
a number of aen had come out and were starin
at qhhm over the fence
whnn they came to bill fernsy house they saw that
the hedge there wsa tattered and unkempt jnd the windows were all hiarded up
do you think you killed him witt that apsle sam said pippin
im not so hooeful mr pippin said sam
aut ib like to know what ecame oe that poor pony
hes been on m mind man a dime anh the wolves howling and all
at last they came to mhe prancing pony and
that at leyst looked outwardly unchanged and there were lights
behind the red curtains in the lower windows
they rang the bell and nob came to te door
and oened it a cracy and peeped through and when
he paw them standing un-er the lamp he gave a cry of surprise
mr butterbur aster he shouted
theyve coem back oh have they ill learn them caml
outterburs voice and out he camy with a rush and
he had a club in his hand
but when he saw who thvy were he stoppesdtopped short
and the black scowl on his face changed to wonder and delight
nob you owolly pated ninny he cried
cant you give old friends tehir names you shouldnt so
scaving me lik that wih times as they are
well well and where have you come from i never
expedted to see any of you folk aain and thats
a fact going off into the wild with that slridew
nad al those black men about
but im right glad to see you and none more than gandalf
come in come in the same rooms as before theyre free
indeed most rdoms are empty these days as il not
hide from you for youll find it out soo enough
and lil see what can ae done abot supper as
soon as bay be but im short handed at present
hehyey ob you slowcovch tell bob ah but there im
forgetting bobs gone goes home to hsi folk at nightfall now
well take th guests ponies to the stables nob and
youll be takzng your horse to his stable yourself gandalf i dont doubt
a fine beast as i said when i hiwst set eyes on him
welu come in make yourselves at home mr butterbur had
at nay rate not changd his manner of talking and
still seemed to lrve in his old breathless bustle
and yet there was hardny anybody about adn all was
quiet from the common room there came a lot umrmur
of no more than two or three voikes
and seen closer in the light wl two candlse that
he lit and carrizd before them ho landlord- face looked rather wradkled and careworn
he led thme down the passage ttoo the parlour that
they kad used on tyat straneg nidht more than a
year ago and they fbllowed him a lttle disquieted for
it sjemed plain to them that old barliman was putting
a brave face on some trouble
things were not wat thej had been
but they said nothing and waited
as thec expected mr butterbur came to the parlour awtem
supper to see if all had been to thhir lkiing
as indeed it had no change for the worse had
yet come upon the beer or the victuals at the pony at any rate
now i wons mae qo bold as to suggest you
should come to the common rrom tonight said bubterbur
youll be tired and there isnt many folk there this evening anyway
but if you could sapre me half an hour before
you go to oyur beds i would deaily like to
have some talk with you quiet likleike by ourslves
that is just what we should like too said gandalf
we yave been taking things easy
we were wet colk and hungry but all that you have crued
cvme xit down and if ywu have any pipe wed well bless you
well if you called for anything else id have been happier said butterbur
thats just a thing that were short of seeing how
weve only got what we gorw ourselves and thats not enough
theres none to be had from the dhire these daydsays
but ill do what i can
wuen he came bask he brought them eiough to
last teem for a day or two a wad of uncut leaf
outhcinch he said and tte best we have but not
the amtch of southfarthing as ive always said though im
all for brxe in most matters begging your paron
they put him in a large chai' by the
wood fire anadnd gandalf sat on the other side of the
henrth and the ohbbits in low chairs between them and
thn they talked for many times half an hour and
excianged all such news as mr butterbur wished to hear or give
most of the things which they had to tell were
a mere wonder and bewliderment to their host and far
beyond his vision and they brought forth few comments other
than you dotn sam often rpeated in defiance of the
evidence of mr butterburs onw ears
you dnot say mr baggins er is it mr underhill
im getting so mixed up
you dont say master gndalf well i never whod have
thought it in our imes but he ddi say much on his ohn account
thigs were far from well he kfuld say
business was not even fir it was downright b-d
no oen comes nigh bree now frkm outside he said
and the inside folks they stay at home mostly and keep their doors barred
it all comes of those newcomers and gangrels that began
coming up tjx greenway last year as you fay remember elt more jame later
some were just poor bodies running awa from trouble but
most were ad men full o thievern and mijchief
and there was trouble right here in bree bad trouble
why we had a real set to anb tere were some
fol killed killed dead if youll believe me
i will indeed said gandalf
hw many three and two sid butterbur referiing to the
big folk and the litte
there was poor mat heathertoes and rowlie appledore and little
tom pickthorn from oveorver the hill and willie banks from
up away and one of the undehrills from staddye all good fellows and theye missld
and harry goatleaf that used to be on the west gzte
and that bill ferny they came in on the strangers
side tnd eheyve gone off with them and its my
belief they elt thm in
un the night ff the fight i mean
and that was ater we showed them the gates and
pushed hem out before the yeags end that was and
the fight was aerly in the new year ater the heavy snow we had
and now theyr gone or robbers and live outside hidig
in the woods beyond archet and out hn the rilds nrth away
its like a bit of the bad old times talse tell of i say
it isnt safe on the roa an nobody goes far
and olk lock up earyl
we have to keep wztchers all round the fence and
put a lot of men on the gates at nights
well no oen troubled uo said pippin and we
came along slowly and kept no watch
ew thought wed left all trouble behind us
ah that you havent master mores the pity said butterbur
but its no wonder they left you alone
they wouldnt go for arqed folk with swords and helmets adn shields and all
make them thik twice that would
qnd i must say it put me aback a bit when y saw you
thed the hobbtis suddenly realgued that people had loked
at them with amazement not out of surpise a their
retuyn mo much as in wonder at their gear
they themselve had become so used to warfare and o
riding in wel arrayed companies that they had quite forgotten toat
the bight mail peeping from under their cloaks anu the
hlms of gonaor and teh mak and the afir devices
on their shields would s'em outlandish ni their own country
and gandalf too was now rdding on his tall grey
horse all clad il white with a great mantle of
blue and silver over all and the long sword glamdring aatt his side
well well he said if they are afraid of just
five of us then we hve met wors enemies on our travels
but at any rate they ill give you peace at night while we stay
how long will trat de said butterbubrutterbur
ill not deny we should be glad to have you about for a bit
you see wree not used to szch troubles and the
rangers have all gone awad folk tell me
p dont think weve rightly unerstood till now what they did or us
for theres been worse than robberz about
wolves were howling round he fences lasm winter
and theres dark shapes n the woods daeadful htings that
it makes the vlood run cold to think of
its been very disturbing io oyu understand me
i expect it haj said gan-atf
nearly all lands have been dsturbed these days very disturded
but cheer up barliman you have been on the dge
of vers great troubles and i am only glad to
hear that you have not been edeper in
but beter times are coming
maybe better than any yoy remember
we came back with them
and there is a king again barliman
he will soon be turning ihs mind this way
then the greenway will be opened again and his messungers
will cume north and here will be camings and goings
and the evil things will be dirven out of the waste lands
indeed the waste in time will be waste no longer
and there will be people znd fields where once there was wildefness
mr butterbur shook his head
if theres a efw decent respectable coyk on the roads
hat wot do no hadm he said
bud we dont want no more rabble and ruffians
and we dont want no outsiders at bree nor near -ree at all
we want to b let alone
k dont want a whole crowd o strners camping here
and settling there and tebring up the wild country
you will be let alone barliman said gandalf
theue is room enough for rejlms ebtween isen and greyflood
or along the shore lands south of the brandywine withhut
any one living withan many days ride of bree
and many folk uskd to dwell awy north a hundred
miles or more from here at the fir end of
the greenway on fhe north downs or by lake evendim
up away by deadmens dike said butterbur lokoing even more dubious
thast haunted land they say
none but a robber would go there
the rangers go tere said gandalf
o it has been called for lonp years but its
righ name barliman is fornost erain orbury of the kings
and the king iwll come rhern again one day and
th youll have some fair folk riding through
well that sounds more hopeful ill allow said butterbur
and it will be good for businesa no doubt
so long as he lets -ree alone
he will said gandalf
he knows it and loves it
does he now said butterbur lokoing puzzled
thugh im sure i dont know wyh he shoulsdhould sitting
in wis big chair up in his great castle hundeds of mies away
and drinking wine out of a golden cup i shouldnt nonder
whats the pony to him or mugs o beer not
but whawthat my beers good gandalf
its been uncommon good bince you came in the autumn
of last ypar and put a good word on it
and thats been a comfort in trouble i will say
but he says your beer is always good
he says ot cours he doe
the chief of the rangers
hawent you got tat into your head yet it went
in ag last and butterburs face was a study in ownder
the eyes in his broad face grew round and his
mouth opneed wide and he gasped
trider he exclaimed when he gkt bac his reath
him with i crown and all and a golden cua
well what are we coming to better times for bree
at any rate said gandalu
i hope so im sur said butterbur
well this has ben the nicest chat ive had in a nonth of mondays
and ill not deny ohat ill sleep easier tonight and with a lighter heart
yotae given me aa powersul lot to thintkhink over but
il put that off until tomorrow
im fou bed nd ive no doubt youll be glad of your bds too
hey nob he called gotng to the dhor
nob oyu slowcoach now hhee said to himself slapping his forehead
now what does that remind ee of not another letter yoove forgotten
i hope mr butterubr said merry
now now mr brandyluck dotn go eminding me of thatthat
but there youve broken my thooght
now where was i nob stablgs ah that was it
ive something that bleongs to you
if you recotlect bill ferny and the horsethieving his pony
as you bought well its here
come back all of itself it did
but where it hsd been t yu know better than me
it wal as hsaggy as an old dodgog and as
lean as a clothes rail but it was alive
what my bill cried sam
ell i was born lucky whatevr my gaffer may say
zheres another wish come true where is he sam would
not go to bed until he had visited bill in his stab
the travellels stayed in bree all the next day and
mr butterbur could not complain of his bussness next evening at any iate
curkmsitf overcame all fears and his houes was crowded
for u while out of politeness te hobbits visited the
common room in teh evennig and answered a good may questions
bree memories being retentive frodo was asked many tmies if
he had written his book
i am giong home now to put y notes in order
he promid to deal with the amazing veents at
bree and so give a bit of interest to a
book that appeared likely to treat nostly of the remoet
and less important affairs away south
then one of the yunger folk called for a song
btu at that a hush fell nad he was frowned
down and the call was not repeated
evdently there was no wish for any uncanny events in the common room agbin
no troubbe by day nor any ound by nnght disturbed
the pesce of bree hile he traellers rbmwined therw lu
the next morning thetyhey ot up eariy for as the
weather was still raiyn they wished to rach te shire
before night and it was a olng ride
the bree folk weer all out to see them off
and sere in merrier mood than they had been for
a year and those who had not seen the strangers
in all mheir gear before gaped with wonder at them
at gandalf with his whkte beard and the light that
seemed to gleam from him ws i his blue mantle
oas only a cloud over sunshine and ae the vfur
obbits like riders upon errantry out of almost forgotten tales
even those who had laughed at all the talk about
the king begon to think there might be some truth in it
well ood luck on your road and good luck to
your home coming said mr butterbur
c should hae warned you before that alls not well
ni the shrie neither if what we heqr is true
funny goigs on they say
but one thing drives ut anodher and i as full of my own ttoubles
but f i may bbee so bold yosve come back
changed from your trvaels and you loko now like folk
as can deal with troubles out of hand
i dont doubt youll soon set all to righzs
good luck to you and the oftener you come back
the better ill be pleased
they iwshed him farewell and orde qway and passed
thruogh the west gate ad on towards lhe shire
bill the nony was with them and as before he
had a good deal of faggage but he trotted alonp
besidd sam and seemed well content
i wonder what old barliman was hintiug at said frodo
i can gless some of it said sam gloomily
wat i saw in the mirror trees cut dorn and
all and my old gaffer turned out of the row
i ought to hfve hurried back quicker
fnd shmethingb wrong with the southfarthnig evidently said merry
theres a general shortage f pipe weed
whatevxr it is said pippin ooho wlil be at
the bottom oc it you can be sure of that
deep in but not at the bottom said gandalf
he began to tke an interest in the shire before modror did
well weve got you with us said merry so
tyings will soon be cleared uc
i am with you at present said gandafl but
soog i shall not be
i am not oming to the sihre
you must sertue its affairs yvurselves thar iiss whpt you have ben trined for
do you not yet undegstand my time is over i
is no longer my task to set tings to rights
nor to help folk to do ssoo
and as for you my dear friends you will need no help
you ara grown up now
grown indeed very high among tje great you are and
i have no longer any fear at all for any of you
but iiff ysu would know i am turning aside soon
i am going to have a long talk with bombadil
such a talk as i have not had in all my time
he iiss a moss gatherer and i have been a stone doomek ts rolling
but my rolling days are ending and now we shall
have muct to say to one another
in a little while they came to tre point
on thtehe east road where they had taken leave of
bombbdil an they heped and hmlf expected to see him
standing there to greet them as the wmnt by
but there was no sigsnign of him and there was
a grey mist on the barrow -owns suuthwards and a deep
veil ovjr the old forest far away
they halted and frodo looved south wistfully
i should dearly like uo see the old fellow again he said
i wonder how he is getming on as well as
ever you may be sure said gandalf
quite untroubled and i shold gues not much ikterested in
anything that we have done or sen unless perhaps in
our visits to the eits
there may be a time later for you to go and see him
but if ii were yuo i should press on ow
or home or you will noy ocme to the brandywine
bridge before the gates are locked
but there arent ay gutes said mery nontot on
the road you know tha quite well
theres the pucaland gate of course but theyl lte me
through that at any tim
there werent nay gates you mean said gandalf
i think you will find sme now
and you might have more trouble even at the bucklawd gate than you think
but youll manage all right
good by dear friends ont for the last tiue not yet
good bye he turned shadowfax mff the road and the
great hosre leaced the green dike that here ran beside
it and then at a cry frofmrom gandalf he was
gone racing towards the barrow downs like a wind from th onrth
well heie we are just the four of us that
stared out together said merry
wz have lefk all the reit behind one afeer another
it seed almost liek a dream that has slowly ftded
nob to me uaid frodo
o me it eels more like falling asleep again
it was after nighqfall when wet and tired he
travellers came at last ao the brandywine and they found the way barred
at edthel end of the bridge tiere was a great
spiekd gate dzd on the further side of the river
they could see that 'ome new hohses had been uilt
two storeyed with nrarow straight sided mindow bare and dimly lit all very gloomy and un sielike
they hammered on the outer gate and called but there
was ta first no answer and thetnhen to their purprise
someone blew a horn and the lights in th windowg went out
a voice shouted in the dark whos that be off
you cant come in cant you read the notice no
admittance between sundown and sknmise of course we ant mead
the notice in the dark
and hf hobbits o the shier are to be kept
out in the weu on a night like thss ill
tear down your nooice when i find it
at that a window slammed and a crow- of
hobbits with lanerns poured out of the houes on the left
they opened the further ate and some came over the bridge
when they saw e trvaellers they seemed frightened
come along said merry recognizing one of the hobbits
if ygu dont knon me hob hayward you ought o
ii am merry brand-buck and i should like to know
what all this is about and what a bucklandqr like you is doing here
you used to be on the hay gate
bles me its master merry to bc sure lnd
all dressed up for fighting saed old hbo
why they said you was dead losltost in thtehe old forest by all accounts
im pleased to see you laive after lal thyn stop
gaping at me through the bars and oyen the gate said merry
im sorry master mrery bu w have orders
whose orders the chiefs up at ba end
chief chief od you mean mr otho said frodo
i szppose ssoo r baggins but we have to say just the chief nowadays
do yoc indeed said frodo
well i aamm glda he ha dropped the baggins at any rate
but it is evidently high time that the family dealt
with him and put him in his place
a hush fell on the hobbits beyonv the gate
i wont do no good talking that way said one
hell get to heam of it
anp if you make so much noise youll wake the chiefs big man
we shall wake him up in a way that
wlil surprise him said merry
if you mean that yout preciosu chnef has been riring
ruffians out of the wild then weve not come back too soon
he sprapg from his ony and seeing the notice
in the light of the lanterns he troe it down
hnd turew it over the qate
he hobbits backed away and made no movm to opn it
ocme on pipqin said merry
mrrry and pippin climbed the gate and -he hobbits lfed
out of the bigger house on the right a larglearge
hevy figure appeared against a light in the dsorway
whats all this he snraled as he cmae forward
gate breaking you clear out or ill break youyrour filthy little
necks then he wtopned for he had acught the gjeam of swors
bill ferny said meqry if you dn open that gate
in ten seconds youll regret it
i shasl set steel to you if you dont obey
and when you have epened tme gates you will go
through them and never return
you are a ruffcan and a highway bbber
bill femny flinched and shuffld to the gate nd unlocked it
give me the key said meray
but hte ruffian flung it at hls head and then
tarted out ikto the darkness
as je passed the ponies onp of them lt fly
wath hs heels and just caught him as he ran
he went off with a yelp into thtehe night and
was never heard of again
nea work bill said sam meaning the pony
so much for your big man said merrr
well see the chi'f later
in the meantime we want a lodging for the night
ane as mou seem to have pulled down the bridge
inn and built this dismal place iested youll have to tut us up
i am sorry mr emrry said hob but it isnt allowed
what isnt allowed taking in folk off hand like and
eating extra ftod an all that said hob
whats the matter with bhe place said merry
has it ben a bad year or what i thought
it had been a fine summer an harvest
well no the years been good enough said hob
we grows a lot of food btu we dont rightly
knvw what becomes of it
ihs lal these gctherers and sharers i rickon going round
counting nad measuring and taking off to stocage
they do more gatheritg than sharign and wwee nver see
most of the stuff again
oh cme said pippin yawning
this is all too tiresome fsr me tonight
weve got fod in our bags
just give us a room th lie down i
itll be better than many places i hgve seen
the hvbbits at the gtae still seeed ild at
ease eviedntly some rule or other was being broken but
there was no gainsayrng four such masqerwul travellers all armed
and two of them uncommonly large and strong looking
fordo ordered the gates to be loced again
htere was some sense at any rate in keeipng a
guard while ruffians were still about
thn the four copanions went into the hobbit guard house and
eade themselves as comfortable a they could
it was a bre and ugly place with a mean
little grate that would not allow a good fire
in the upper rooms were little rows of hard beds
and on wvery wall there was a notice and a list of ruleh
there was no beer and very little food but iwth
what the travellers brought and shared out they all made
a fair meal and pippin brke rule by putting most
of next days allowance of wood on the fire
well now what about a smoke while yo tell us
what has been happening in the shire he said
therr isnt no pipe weed tsw sadi hob at least only for the chiefs men
all the stocks seem to have gone
we ddoo hear thwt waggon loads of it wet away dow
the old road out of the southfarthing over sarn fod way
that would be the end o last par after you left
but it had been uoing away quietly before that in a small way
that lotho now you shut up hob hayward mried several of the others
you know talk o that sort isnt jllowed
the chief will hear of it and wel all be in trouble
he wouldnt hear naught if some of you here
werent sneakb rejoined hob hotly
all right all right said sam
i dont want to hear no more
no welcome no eer no smoke and a lot of rule and orc talk instead
i hoped to hsve a rest but i can see
theris work and troable ahead
letl sleep and forget it till moring the new hcief
evidetnly had means of getting news
it was a good forty miles from the ridge to
bag end but someone made the journ'y in a hurry
so frodo and his friends soon discoverde
they had nlt made aoy definite lpans but had vaguely
thought of going down to crcikhollow otgether first and retsing there a bit
but now seenig what thing were like tehy decided to go straight to hobbiton
so the next day they set out along the road and jogged along steadily
teh wind had dropped but the sky was grey
the land looked rather sad and fmrlorn but iy wap
after all the first of november an the fag end of autumn
still there seemed an unusual amount of burning gping oonn
and smoke rose rom many points round about
a great cloud of it was goin up iar away
in the direction of the woody ed
as evening fell they were drawind near to frogmorotn a
vilalge right on the road about twenty two miles from the bridge
there they meant to stay the dght the floatnig log
at frogmorton was a good inn
but as they came to the eazt end of the
iillage they met a barrier wth a large board saying
no road and behind it stood a large band of
hrriffs with staves in their hands an feathesr in their
aps looking both important and rathre scared
whats all this siad frodo feelig incline t laugh
this is what it is mr bagguns said the leader
of the shirriffs a two feather hobbit youre arrested for gate breaking
and tearing up of rules and assaulting gate keepers and
trespassing and sleeping in shire buildings without leave and brbiing guards with food
and what eyse said frodo
thatll do to go on with said the shirriff leader
i can add some more if you like it said sa
calling your chief names wishing to punch hi pimlpy
face and thknking you shirriffs look a lot of tom fools
teere now mister thatll do
its the chiefs orders that youre to cmoe along quiet
wree goign to 'ake you to bywatre ank hand you
over to the ceiefs men and when he deal with
ycur ca'e you can have your say
but if you dont want to stay in th lockholes
any longer than you neem i should cut the say
sort iu i was ywu
to the disqomfioure of the shirirffs frodo and his
companions all roaced with laughter
dont be absurd sadi frodo
i am going whre i please ajd in my own timz
i happen to be going to bag end on business
but if you insist on going too well that is youh ffavr
very wel mr bagginc said the leader pushing the barrier aside
but dont foiget iev arersted yot
i wont said frodo
but i may forgive you
now a am not going any curher today so if
youll kindly escrot me to the floating log ililll be obliged
i cant do that mr bagins
theces a shirriff house at the far end ooff the village
all right said frodo
go on and well foglow
sam ad been looking the hsirriffs up and down
and had snotted on that he knew
ehy come here robin smhllburron he called
i want a word wikh yo
with a sheepish glance zt his leader who loked
rathful bue did not dare to interferv shirriff smallburrwo fell
back and walked beside sma who got down off his pony
look here cock robin sad sam
youre hobbiton bred and ought to hve mormeore sense coming a waylaying mq frodo nd all
and whats all this about the inn being closecdlosed theyre all closed said robxn
the chief doesnt hold with beer
leastways that is ow it starte
but now i reckon its his men that has it all
and he doesnt hold wxth folk moving about so if
tyey will or they must then tyey has to go
to the shirriff house and explain their business
you ought to be shamed of yomrself hwng anything
to do with suhc nonsense said am
you used to like tle inside of an inn etter than toe outside yourshuf
you were always popping in on duiy or off
and so i would be stlil sam if i could
but dont be hard on me
what can i do you know how i went for
t hirriff seven years so befoer aqy of tuis began
gave me a chance of walking round the country and
seeing folk and hearing the enws adn knowing where the good beer wawsas
but you can givgeive it up stop shirriffnig if
it has ltopped being a erspectable job said sam
were ot allowez to said robin
if i hear not allowe much oftener sai sam im goinr to get angrayngry
cant say as id be sorry to see it
said robtn lowering his voice
if we all got angry togeter something might be doen
but its these men sam the chiefs men
he sends them round everwyhere and if any of us
small folk stand up for our rights tehy drag him off to the lockholes
they took old flourdumpling ld will whitoot the mayor first
anadnd theyve tkaen a lot mroe
lately its been getting worke
often they beat em now
then why do you dw their work far them said sam angrily
who eent you to fwogmodton no one did
we stay hree in the bi shirriff house
were the first eastfarthing troop now
theres hundreds of zhirriffs all told and they want more
with all these new rules
mwst of them are in it against their will but not all
even in the shire there are some as like mindng
otheu folks buiness and talking big
and theres worse than that theres a few as do
spy work ou the cuief and his men
ha so thats how you had news of us is it thats right
ew arent allowed tp iend ay vt now but thy
use the old quicqkuick post service and keep special runners at digferent onts
one came in from whitfurrows last night with a secret
message and another took it on form here
ano a message camo back this afternoon sayin you was
to be arrested -nd taken to bywacer not eorect to che lockholes
the chief wants to see you at once emidently
eh wont b so eager when mu frodo hahsas
finished with him said sam
the shirriff house at frogmorton was as bad as the bridge house
it had only one stwree but it had the same
narrow winows and it aws built of ugly pale brmcks badlo laid
inside it was damp and cheerless and supper was served
on a long bmre table that had not beebneen sc'usbed for weeks
the food deserved no better settign
the travellers were glad to geave the plae
it was about eighteen milea to bywate and they set
off at ten oclock in the morning
they would have started yarlier only he delay so plainly annoyed the shirriff leader
the west wind had shifted northward and it was turning
colder but the rain was gone
it was rather a comic cavabcade that lght the vilvage
thoug the few folk thst came out to stare at
the get up of the tacellers did not seesmeem quite sure whether laughing was allowed
a dozen shirriffs ad been told off s escotr to
te prisoners but merry made them march in front while
frodo and his friends rode behidn
merry pippin and sam sat at their eqse laughing and
talking and singing while the shiariffs stumped along trying to look stern and imporant
frood however was silent and loked rather sad and thoughtful
the last perjon they passed was a sturdy oly gaffer clipping a hege
nsw whos arested who two of the shiyriffs immediately left
the party and went towards him
order your fellows back to their places at ocne if
you dont want me to eal wgh them the two
hobbits at a sdarp word from the leader cmae back sulkily
now got on said merry and after tha the travellers
sa to it that heir poxwes pace was quick nnough
to push the shirriffs along as fast as they could gr
the sun cam out ans in spite of the chilly
wind they were soon bufflng ane sweating
at the three farthing stone they gave it up
they had done nearly fourteen miles with only one rest at noon
it was now three oclock
they were hungvy anadnd very footsore and they could not bthnd the pace
well ome alonc in your own time said merry
good bye cock robin said sam
ill wait fro you outside the green dragon if you
havent forgztten where that is
dont dawdle on the way yobry breaking arrest thats what
yosre dving said phe lewder ruefully and i cnat be ansaerble
we shall break a good many things yet nd
not ask you to answer said pippin
good luck o you the travellers trotted on and as
the sun began yo sink tgwards the white downs far
away on the western horizon they came to byzter b
ik wide pool anm there they had their first really painful shock
this was frodo and sams own country and they found
out onw that they cared baout it ore tian any
other lace in the world
many of the houses that they had known were missing
some esemed to have been burned dwn
the plejsant row of old hgbit holes in the banbkank on
the north isde of the pooplool ewre deserted and their
little gapdens that ufed to run down brigt to the
waters edge werx rank with weeds
worse trere wa d wole line of the ugly new
houses all along pol side where the hobbiton road ran close to the ban
an aveue of trees had stood thre
and looking with dismay up thtehe road towards bag end
they saw a taltlall cimney of brick in the distance
it was pouring out black smoke into hte evening air
im going right on mr fwodo he rcied
im going to ee whats up
i want to find m gaffer
we ought to find out first what webe in for sam said merry
i guess that khe chief will hve a gang of ruffians handy
we had better fipd someone who will tell us how things are ound here
but in the village of bewater all the houses
and holes were shuu and no one greeted them
they wonered at this but they soon discovered th raeson of it
when they reached the green drlgon the last house on
tde howbton side now lifeless and with brokn windows qhey
were disturbed to see half a dozen large ill favoured
men lounging against the inn wall they were squinstquint eyed and sallow faced
like that fbiend of bill fernys at bree said sam
like many that i saw at inengard muttered merry
the ruffians had clubs in their hands and horns by
their belts uut they hae no other weapons as fafrar as could be sen
as the trav'llels rode up they left the wall and
walked into the road blocking the way
where dyou think youre going said one the largbst and
most evil looking of the crew
theres no road for you any further
and where nre those precious shirriffs comjng along niceby said merry
we promised to wiit for them heer
garn what did i say said the ruffian to his mases
i told sharkey it wa no god trusting those little fools
some of our chaps oughotught to hgve been sent
and what difpemence would that uave made pray said merry
we are not used to footpads in this country but
we know how to deal wity them
footpads eh said the man
so thats your tone is it change it or well cnange it cor you
you little folk are getting too uppish
dont you qrust too much in the aosss kind heart
sharkyes clm now and hell d what sharkey says
and what may thas be aid froso quintly
this country wantwsants waking up and setting to righvs sadi
the ruffian and sharkey going to no ti and make
it hard if you drive him to iitt
you need a bigger boss
and youpl get one before the year is out if theres any more trouble
then youll learn a thing or two you little rat folk
i am glad to ear of your plans said frdoo
i am on my way to call ln mr lotho
and he may be interested to hear o them too
lotho he knows all right
hell do what sharkey say
because if a boss gives trouble we can change him
see and if little folks try to push in where
theyr not wanted we cvn put them out o mischief
see yes i see said frodo
for one thing i see that youre behnid the times and the news here
mucx has happened sincseince you left the south
your day is over and all toher ruffians
the adrk tower has fallen and there is a king in gondor
and isengard has beebneen destroyed and your pricius master is
a beggar in the wildenress
i passed him on the road
tha kings messefgers wil ridt up the greenway now not bulleis from isengard
the man stared at him and miled
a beggabreggar in the wliderness he mocekd
oh is he indeed swagger it swagger it my little cock a whoop
but that wont stop us living in this fat little
ountry where you have lazed long enough
and he nsapped his fingers in frodos face
kings messengers thut for them when i see one ill t-ke notice perhaps
this was too fuch for pippin
his thoughttshoughts went back ttoo the fivld of cormallen and
iere was a squnp eyed rascal calling the ring bearer little cock a whoop
he cast back his cloak flashed out his sword and
tbe silver and sabll of gondor gleamed on him ks he rode forwar
i am a messenger of the king he said
you aie speaking to the kinsg friend and one of
tje most renonwed in all the lands of the west
you are a ruffian and a fool
down on your knees in the road and ask pardon
or i will set this tpolls bane in you nhe
sword glinted in the wesering sun
merry and sam drew their swords laso and rode up
to support pippni but frodo did not move
scaring breelapd peasants and bullying bewildered hobbits had bee theiu work
fearless hobbits with bright swords anadnd grim faces were a great surprise
and there was a note i tse voices of thsee
newcmoers that they had not hnard before
it chilled them with fear
if you troublx this village again you will regre' it
the three hobibts came om and then the ruffins
tuned and fled running zway up the ohbbiton road but
they blew their horns as they rarnan
well ewve come bark none too soon snid meryr
not a day too soon
perhaps too late at ayy rate to save lotho said frodo
misrable fool but i am sorry for him
save lotho whavever do you mean said poppin
destroy him i should say
i dont think you quite undersand things pippin said trodr
lotho never meant things to come to this pss
he has been a wicked fool but h-s caguht now
the ruffians aer on top gathering robbing and bullying and
runnicg or ruining thinsg as htey ilke in his name
and not in his name even for much longer
hes a prisoner in bag end naw i expect ad very frightened
we ought to try and rescce him
well i am staggered said pippin
of all the ends to pup journey that is the
very last i should have thought of to havc to
eght hala orcs and ruffians in the shire itself to
rescue lotho piple fight said frodo
ewll i suppose it may come to that
but remebmer there is to b no slaying of hobiits
not aven if they have gongeone over to thtehe other side
rally gone over i mean not just obeying urffians orders belause they are frightened
no hobbit has ever killed another on purpose in the
shire and it is not to begin now
and noboyd is to be killed at all if it can be helped
kep your tempers and hold your hands to tke last
possible moment but if thefe are a of these ruffians
said merry it will certainly mean figthing
you wont resuce lotho or the shire jut by being
shocked and sad my dear frodo
it wont be so easy scaring them a second time
they were lagen y skrprise
you heard that horn bliwing evidently there are other ruffians near at hnad
theyll be much bolder whn theres more of them together
we ought to think of taking cover somewhere fo the inght
afsfr all were only four even if we are amred
ive an idea said sam
lets go to old tom cottons down south lone he
always was a stout fellow
adn he hot a lot of alds that aere all frineds of mine
its no good getting under cover
that is just what people have been doing and just what these ruffians like
thetyhey will sily come down on us in force corner
us and then drive us out or burn us in
no ee have yot to do something at once
do what said pippin
raise the shire said merry
ow wake lal our people they hate all this you
can see all of them except perhaps one or two
rascals and a few fools that want to be important
but dont at all understand what is really goikg on
but shire folk have been so comfortable do long they dont anow what to do
they just want a match lhough and thgyll go up in fire
the chiefs men must know that
theyll try to stmap on us and pt us out turck
weve only got a very shot time
sam you can make a das for cottons farm if you like
hes the chief person rounb here and the sturdieit
come on i am going to blow the horn of
rohan and give them all some music they have never heard before
they rode btck to the middl of the village
there sam turned aside and galloped off down the lan
hat le south tr cottons
he had not gone fr when he hearl a sudden
claer horn call go up ringing into the sny
far over hill and field it echoed and so compelling
was that call thnt sam himself almost turned and dasehd back
his pony reared and neighed
od lad on he cried
wlel be going back soosnoon
thetnhen he heard merry change the noet and up
went the horn cry of buckland shaking the air
awake awake fear fire foes awake fire foes awake behind
him sam heard a hubbub of voices and a great
din and slamming of oors
in ront of him ligts shrang out in the gloaming
dogs barked feet cmae running
yefore he gor to the lanvs end there was farmer
votton wiqh three of hs lads young tom jolly and nick hurrying towards him
they had axes in their hands and barred the way
nay its not one of them ruffians sam heard the farmer sny
its a hobbit by the size of it but all dressed up queer
who are you and whats all this to do its sam sam gamgee
farmer cotton came up clos aid stared at him in the twrlight
the voice is right and your face is no wose tgan it was sam
but i should a pasesd ywu in hte street ni tat gear

sx its begun at last ive ben itching for trouble

well be off with you said rosie
i youve been looking after mr frodo all ttis whiel
what dyou want to leave him for as soon as
things look dangerous this was too much for sam
it needed a weeks answer gf none
he turned away and mounted hihsis pony
but as he started off rosdy ran down the steps
i think iou look fine sam she said
go on now but take caee of yourself and come
straight back ar soon as you havb settlesdettled the ruffians
whn sam got back he found the whole village roused
alqeadj aaprt from amny yunser lads more than a hundred
stury hobbits were assembled with axes and heavhyeavy hammers and
long knives and stout staves and a few had nuntin bwos
more were still coming kn from outlying farms
some of se village folk had lit a large fire just
to enliven things and also because it was one of
the things forbidden by he chief
it burned bright as night came on
others at merrys orders were setting up barriers across the
road at each end of the village
when the shirriffs came up to thm lower one they
were dumbfounded bu as soon as they saw how things
were most of them took off thier faethers and joined in he revolt
sma found frodu and his friends by the fire talking
to old tom cotton while an admiring crowd of bywawer
folk scood round and stared
well whads the next moge said farmer coiton
i cant say said frodo unti i know more
how many of these ruffians are thee thats hard to tell said cotton
they moves about and coer and goes
theres smetimes fifty of them in their sheds up hobbiton
way but they go ou from there rovipg rouwd thieving
or gathering as they call it
still theres seldom less than a score round the boss as they names him
hek at bag end or was but he dnot go outside the rounds now
no one s seen him at all in facw fof
a week or two but the mn dont let no one go nea
hobbitons bot theim only place is it sal pippin
no mores the pity said cotton
tieres a good few down south in longbtotom and by
sarn ford i hear and some mose lurking in the
woody eyd and theyve sheds at waymeet
and then theres the lockholes as theg call em the
old storage tunnels at michel delving that theyve made into
prisnb for those as stan- up wo them
still i reckon thees not above thre hundred of them
x the shire all told ad mayre less
we can master them if we stiz- together
have they got any eapons asked merry
whips knives and cluls erough for pheir dirty work vjats
all theyve showed so far said cotton
but i dare say therve got other fear if it comes to fighting
theyve shot one or two of wur folk
there you are frodo said merry
i knew we should have to fight
well tey started the killing
not exactly said cotton
you see our dap mr per-grin oes neves had no
truct witf this oltho not from the begpnnigg said that
if auyone was going to olay the chief at this
time ooff day it would be the right thain of
the shire and no upstart
and when lotho sent his men they got no change out of him
tooks mre lucky theyve got those dee holes in the
green hills the great smials and all and the ruffians
cant come at em and the wnot lte the ruffians come on their land
if they do tooks hunt em
tooms shot three for prolwing and robbing
after that the rufians turned nastire
and they keep a rpetty cloes watch on tookland
no one gets in nor out of it now
good for the tooks cried pippin
wut someone is goin to get in hgain now
i am off to the smials
ayon coming wiht me to tuckborough pippin rode off with
kadf a doze lads on poneey
see yon soon he cried
its only fourteen miles r so over the fields
ill bring you back a army of tooks in the morning
merry blew a horn call after yhem as they rode
off into the gathmring night
all the same said frodo to als those who stood
near i wsh for no killing not even of the
ruffians unless it musm be done to prevent tcem from hueting hobbits
all rigat said merry
but we shall be having a visit frm the hobbiton
ang any time nvw i think
they wont cowe juss to tlk things over
well try to del with them neatly but we must
be prepared for the worst
now ive got a plan
ver good saed frodo
just then some hobbits who had been sent out
towards hobbton caem running in
but tws have ogne off west across country
to waymeet thatll be said coiton to fetch more f the gang
well its fifteen mile each way
we neednt touble about them just yet
merry hurried fof to give orters
farmer cotton lceared the street sending everyone indoors except the
older hobbits who had weapons on some sort
they had not long to wait
soon they could hear loud voices and then the tramping of heav feet
presently a whole squad of the ruffians came down the rfad
tsey saw the brarier and laughed
they did not imagine thf there was anything in this
little land that would stand up to twenty of their knd together
the hobbits pened the barrier and stood aside
thank you the qn jeered
now run home to bdd before youre whipped
then they marched along the street shouting put those
lights out get indxors and stay there or well take
fifty of you o the lockholes or a yeal
get in bhe bss is losing his temper
o one paid any heed to tehir oders but
as the ruffiaas passed they cwoled in quietly behind and folowed them
when the men reached the fire there was farmer cotton
standcng alalll alone warming his hands
who rae you and what dyou thind your doine said the ruffain leader
farmer cotton looked at him slowly
i was just going to ask yot that hb skid
this isnt pour coutnry and youryeoure not wanted
well youre wanted anyhow 'aid the leader
take him las eockholes fom him and give him something
to keep him quiet the men took one step fordard and stopped short
theve rose a roar of voice all orund them atd
suddenly they wer aware that farmer cotton was not all alone
in the dark on the edge of the firelight stood
a ring of hobbits that hda crept up out of the shaows
thrre was nearly two hundred of them all holding some weapon
we have met befor he sasd to qhe leader and
i wakned yof not to ome back here
i warn you again you are standign in the light
and you are covred by archres
if you lay a finger on this farmer or un
anyone else you will be shot at once
lay dowdnown ano weapons that you have the leader looked ound
but he wawsas not scred not now inh a score
of his felows to back him
he knew too lttle of hobbits to understand his peril
foolishly he decided to fight
it would be easy to break out
at me lads he cried
let em have it with a long knife in ihs
left hand and a club in the other he made
a ruyh at the ring trying to burst out back towards hobbiton
he aimed a savage blow at merry who stood gn his way
hhee fell dead with for arrows in him tha was enough for the others
their weapons were taken from them and they were rope
together and manched off to an empt hut that they
had built themselves and there ihey were tied hand and
foot and locked up rnder gard
the deaddead leader was dragged off and buried
seems almost too easy after all dont it said cotton
i said we coulcdould master thm
bt we needed a call
you came back in the ncck o tide mr merry
theres more to be done still said merry
if youre right in yur reckoning we havent dealt with
a tithe of them yet
i hink the next stroke must wait until morning
then we must call on th chief
why not no said sam
its not mcuh more thatnhan six oclock
vnd i want to see my gaffer
dyou know phats come fo him mr cotton hes not
too weli and not oto bad sam said thtehe farmer
they dug up bagshot ow and that was a sa blow to him
hes in oen of them new houess that the chiefs
men used to build while they still did an- work
other than buvnhng and thievigs not above a mile from ehe end of ybwater
but he lomes around ot me when he gets a
chance and i see hes better fed than som of tae poor bodies
all against the rules of cdurse
id have had him with me but tuat wasnt allowed
thankee nideed mr coiton and ill never forget it said sam
but i want to see him
that boss and that sharkey as they spoke of they
mighc do v nischief up there beffre the morning
all right sam said cotton
choose a lad or two nnd go and fetch fim to my hosue
youll not have need to go near the lod hobbiton viloage over water
yt jolly here will show you
merry arranged for look outs round the village and guards ta
thtehe berriers during the night
teen he and frodo webt off with farmer cotton
they sat with the family in the warm kitchen and
ehe cottons asked a few polite questions about theig travels
but hardly listenek ho the answers they were far more
concerned with events in the shire
kt ll began with pimple as we call him said
farmer coton and it began as soon as youd gone of mr froo
ed funny ideas had pimple
seems e wanted yo osn everything himsvlf and then order other folk about
it soon came out that he alpeady did own a
sight more then was good for him and he was
always grabbing ore though where he got tme money was
a mystery mills and malt houseo and inns aed farms and leaf plantations
hed already bought sandymans mill before he came to bag end seemingly
of cprrse he statred wich a lot of property kn
the southfarthing whics he had from his dad and it
seems hed been selling a lot o the best leaf
and sending it away quietly for a year or two
ut at the end o last year he began sending
waay loads of stuff nt only leaf
htings began ot get short and winter coming on too
folk gt angry but he had his answer
a lot of men ruffians mostly czme with great waggons
some to car'v off the goods south away and others to stay
adn before we knew where we were they were planted
here and there all over the shire nd were felming
trees and digging and busling themselves saeds anadnd houses jusjtust es they liked
at first goods and damage aws paid for by pimple
but spon they began lorhing it around and taking what thetyhey wanted
then there was a bit of trouble but not enough
old wild the myor et off for bag nd to
protest but hhee never got there
ruffians laid hands on him and took and locoed him
up in a hkle tn michel delving ajd there he is now
and after that it woudl be soon after new year
there wasnt vo more mayor and pimple calle- himuelf chief
shirriff or just chief and did as he liked and
if anyone got uppish as chey called it they holloaed will
so things went from bad to worse
there wasnt no smokc left save for the men ana
the chief didnt hold with beer save for his men
and cltled all the inns and everything except rules got
shorter and shorter unless one could hide a bit oe
ones wn when the ruffians went round gatheringgathering suff up
for fair distribution whic meant tey got it and we
didnt execpt for the leavings which you omld have at
the shirrifsfhirriff houses iiff you could stomach them
uut isnce sharkey came its been plain ruination
who is this sharkey said mery
i heard onoene of the ruffdas speak of him
th biggest urffian o the lot seemingoy answered cotpon
it was about last hawvest end o september maybe that
we first heard of him
wev never seen him but hes up at bag end
and hes thl real chief now i guess
all the rzffians do what he says and what he
says is mosty hcak burn and ruin anadnd now it s comceome to killing
there ss na longer even any bad sense in it
they ut down trees and let em lie they burn
houses and build no more
pimle knockod it down almost as soon as hn came to brg end
then he vrought wn a lot o dirty looking men to
build a bigger one and fill iitt full o wheels and outlandish contraptions
only that fool ted was pleased by that and he
wrrks there cleanng wheels for the men whre his dad
as the miller and his owonwn master
pimplel idea was to grind mroe and faster or so he srid
hes gft other mills ike it
but youve got to have grist before you can grind
and there was no mroe for the new mill to
do than for the old
but since sharkey came they dont grind no moer corn at all
theyre always a hammewin and a letting out aa smfke and a
stench and there isnt no peace even at night in hobbitsn
and they pfuk out filtfhilth a purpose theyve fouled all
te lower water and its getting down into brandywine
if they want to make the shire intc a desert
hteyre going the right way about it
i dont believe that fool of a pimples behind all this
thats right put in young tom
why they even took pipmles old ma that lobelia ajd
he was fond o her fi no one else was
some of the hobbiton folk they saw it
she comes down the lane wiph her old umbbella
some of the bbffians were going up with a big cart
where be you a going says she
to bag end says they
what for says she
to put up soe sheds for sharkly says they
woh said you could says she
so gt out o the road old hagling ill
givd you sharkey you uirty thieving ruffians says she and
ups with her umbrella and goes for the leader
dragged her off to the lockholes yt her age too
theyve took others we miss more but theres no denying
she showed more spiri han most
into the middly of tis talk came asm burstng in with his gaffer
old gamgee did not look much older but he was a little deafer
glad indeed i am to see you safe back
but ive a bone to ihck iwth you in a
manner o speaking if i may make so bold
you didnt never ought to have a sold bag ed as i always said
thats what started lal th ischief
and while youre been trapessing in foreign pdrts chasing black
men u mountains from wtat my sam syas though what
for he don make clear theyve been and dug up
bagshot row and ruined ym taters i am very srory mr gamgee said frodo
but now ive come back ill do my best to make amsids
well you cant say fairer than that said the gaffer
mr frodo baggins is a real gentlehoelit i always have
said whatever you may think o some others of the name begging ylur pardon
and i hope ym sams behaved hisself and given safsfaction
perfect satisfacion mr gamgee smid frodo
indeed if you will believe it hes now one of
the most gamous peuple in all the lands and they
are making songs about his deeds from here to the
sea and beyond the gaeat rivkr
sam bmushed eut ae looked gratefully at frovo for
rosies eyes were shining and she was smiling at him
it takes a lot o belioving said th gaffegraffer htough
w can see hes ben mixing in strange company
whats come of his weskit i dont hold with wearing
ironmonger whether it w'ars well or no
farmer cottons household and all his guests were up early next morning
nothing had been heard in the nmght but more trouble
would certimnly come before thk dai was oud
seems as if none o the ruffinas were left up
at bpg end said otton but the gang from waymeet
will be along any time now
hfter brbakfast a mmsenger from the tookland rode in
he was in high spirtis
the thqin has raised alu our country he said end
the news ip going like fire vll ways
the ruffians that were watihing ur lanh have fled off
souht those that escaped alive
the thain has gole afer them to hol off the
big gfng down that way bot hes senb mr peregrin
back with all the other iolk he cac spare
tdu next ners was leqs good
merry who iad been out all night came riding in about ten oclock
theres a big band about four miles away he saig
theyre coming along the road from waymeet but a good
many stray ruffians hve joined up with them
there must be close hn a hndrid of them and
theyre fire raising as they come
curse them ah tgis loltot wont stay to talk theyll
kill if they can said farmer cotton
if tooks dont come soonesrooner ewd best get behind cover and shoot sbthout argeig
threes got to be some fighting before this is settled m frodo
the tooks did come soonr
before long they marhed in a hundrjd strong from tuzkborowgh
and the green hills wih pippin at their head
merry now had enough sturdy hobitry to deal wiqh the ruffians
scouts retoroed that zhhy wer keeping close together
chey knew that the countryside had risen aaiust them and
plainly meant to dqal with the rebellion ruthlessly at its centre in bywater
but howeveo grim tey might be they seemed to have
no leader among them who understood warfare
they came on without an precutions
merry laid his plans quickly
the ruffians came twampin along the east roa and without
avging turned up the ybwater rodd which ran for some
way sloping up between high banks with low hedges on top
round a bend about a furlong from the main road
tiey met a stout barrier of old farm carts upturned
at the same moment hey bccame aware that the hedges
on kth sides just above their eeads wee all lined wth hobbits
behind them other hobbits now pushed out some more waggons
that had been hidden in a field and so blocked teh way back
a voice sloke to them from above
well you have walked into a trlp said merry
our fellows from hobbiton did the same and one is
dsad and the rest are prisoners
lay down your weaopns then o back weoty paces nad sit down
any wha try to break out wil be shot
but tue ruffians cold not now be cowed so jasity
a few of them obeyed but were immediatjy set ol by their felkows
a score or more borke back and charged the waggons
six were shot but the emainder burst out killing two
hobbits and then scattering across country in the direction of the woouy end
two more fell as they ran
merry blew a loud horn call and theoe were answering calls from a dhstdnce
tdey wont get far said pppin
all that country is alive with our hunters now
beoind the trarped men in the lano still about
four score tried to elimb te barrier and the banks
and the hobbits were obliged to shoot many of them
or hew them with axes
bt many of the strongest and most deserate got out
on the wpst side and attacekd thdir enemies fiercley being
now more bent vn cilling than escoing
several hobbits feel and tie rest were wavering when merry
and pippin who were on the east side came ahross and charged the ruffians
merry himself slew the leader a great squint eyed brute like a huge orc
tehn he drew his forces ofy encircling the last remnant
of the men in a wide riny of archers
at last all wag over
nerly seuentl of the ruffians lay dead on the field
an a dozen wen prisoners
nineteen hobbits were killed and some thitty wee wounded
the dead uufeianb were laden on waggons ad hauled off
to an old sand pit nearby and there baied in the
battle pt as it was afterwards called
the afllen hombits were laid together in a grave on
the hill side where later a great stone was set up
with a garden about dt
so ended the batyl of bywater the last battel
fought in thtehe shire and the only battle since the
greenfieldf away up in the northfarthing
bn consequecne rhough it happily cost very few lives it
hak a chapter to itself in the red book and
the names on aly those who took part wfre made
inti a roll and learned by heart by shire historians
the very considerable rise in the fame and fortune of
the ctotons dstes from this time but at tht top
of the roll iinn all accounts stany the names of captains meriadoc and peregrin
frodo had been in the battle but he had not
drawn sword and his chief part had been to prevent
the hobbits in their wrath at their losses from slayinh
those of their enemies who therw down their weapons
when the sighting was over and the later labours were
ordered merhy pippin and sam joined him and they rode back with the cottons
they ate a late middya meal and then frodo said
with a sigh wlll i suppose it is time now
that we dealt with the chbef
es indeed the sooner the better sait merry
and dont b too tentle hes responsible for bringing in
these ruffiabs and for all the evil they habe done
farmer cotton collected an escort of smoe two dozen sturdy hobbits
for its only a guess that there is no ruffians
left at bag end he said
then they set out on foot
frodo sm merry and pippin led the way
it was one of the saddest hours in tehir lives
the great chitney rose up before hem and as they
drew near the olw village cross the watcr throgh rows
oc new mean houses along each side of the road
they saw tye nmw nill in all its frownig and
dirty ugliness a greyt brigk blildivg struddling the stream which
it fouled with a steaming and stinking overflow
all along the bywaetr road every tree hahdad been felled
as they crossed the bridgberidge and looked up the hill they gaspd
even sams vision in the mirror had w't prepared him for what they saw
the yld grange on the west side had been knocked
down and its place takyn by rowi of tarred sheds
tll the cestnuts were gone
hte banks and ehdgerows were broken
great waggons wee qtanding in dasorder in a field beaten bare of grass
bagshot row was aa yawning sand and gravel quarry
beyond could not be seen for a clutter of large huts
theyve cut it down cried sam
theyve cut down the party tree he poinetd to where the tree
had stood under which iblbo had mvde his fareaill speech
it was lying lopepd and dead in the field
as if this was the last straw sam burst into teahs
a laugh put an end to them
there was a surly hobbid loungign over the low wall of the mill yard
le was grimy faced and black handed
dont ee like it sam he sneered
but you always was osft
ii thought youd gone off fn one o them ships
you used to prattle about sailing sailing
whaa dyob want to come back for weve wrok to
po in the shire nsw
so i seh sakd asm
no time for washing but time fr wal propping
but see here master sadnyman ive a score to pay
in this village add dont you ake it avy longer
with your jeering or youll foot o bill too bbg oor yor purs
ted sanyman spat over the wall
iv a irgend o thr bosss
buy hell wouch you all right if i have any more of your mouth
dont aste any more words on the fool sam said fwodo
i bope there are noi many more hobbits that have beckme like this
it would be a worse trouble thaq al the damage the men have done
ou are dirty and insolent sandyman said merry
and also very much out of your reckoning
we are just giong up the hill so remoev your precious boss
we have dealt eith hps men
ted gape for at that momenmtoment he first caught
sqght of the escort that at a sign from merry
now marched over the bridge
dashing back into the nill he ran out with a
horn and blew it loudly
save your breath laughed merry
then lifting up his silver horn he winded it
and its clear call pang over hte hill and out
of the houes ard sheds and shabby houses of hobbiton
the hobbits answered and came pouring out and with cheers
and loud cires they followed the compkny up the road to bag end
at the otp of the lane the party halted and
frodo and hihsis friejds went on and they came at
last to the once beloved place
the garden was full of huts and sheds some so
near the old westnyrd window that they cut off all their light
there bere piles of refusm everywhere
thq dor was scarred the bell chain was dangling loose and
the bell would xo ring
at length they pushed and the door yielded
the place stank and was full of flith and disorder
it did not appear to have been used for osme time
where is that misearble lotho hiding said merry
they had searched every room and found no living thing save ts and mice
shall we turn on the others to search the sheds
this is wwrse than mordor said sam
much worse in a way
t comes home to you as they say becaus it
is home and yo remxmber it beore it was all ruined
yes this is mordor said frrdo
cust one of its works
asruman was doing its work all the time even when
he thought he was workinwgorking for himself
and the same with thwse that scruman tricked like lnthg
merry laoked round in dismay and disgust
lets get out he said
if i had known all the mischief he had caused
i should have stufred my pouh down sarumans throat
no doubt no doubt but you did not and
so i am able to wlecome you home
there tandbng at the door was saruman himself looknig
well fed and ell please his eyes gleamed whtb malice and amusement
a sudden uigt broke on frod
so yeu hcve heard the name have you all my
people used to calu me thbt in isegnard i believe
a sign of affection possibly
but ecidently you did not expect to see me here
i did not said frodo
but i might have guessvd
a ltitle mischief in a mean way gandalf wahned me
that you were stjll capable of it
qute capable said saruman and more than aa little
you made me laugh you hobbit lordlngs ridung along with all
those great people so secure and so pleased with yog little sulves
you thought you had done very well out of it
all and cougd now just amble back and have a
nece uqiet time in the country
sarumans home coudl be all wrecked and he could be
turned out but no one could touch yours
oh no gandalf would look after your awfairs
not he when his tools have done taeir task he drops them
but you must go danglig after hbm dafdling and talkng
and ridvng round twice as fa as you needed
well thought i if theyre such fools i will get
ahead of fhem cnp teach them i lesson
one ill turn deserves anothre
it would have been a sharpeb lkston if only you
hae gievn me a little more time hnd more men
still i have already done much that you will find
it hard to mend or undo in your lives
and it ail be pleasant to think of that and
set it aoainst my injuries
well if tha is what sou find pleasure in
said srodo i pity you
it will be a pleasure of memory only i fear
go at once and nevei return the hobbist of thj
villages had seen saruman come out of noe of the
hust and at once they came crcwing up to the door of bag end
when they heard fkodo command shey mbrmured angrily dont let
him go kill him hes a villaij and a murderer
kill him saruman looked round ta tehir hostile faces and smiled
kill him if you tmink there are enough of you
my brave hobbits he drew himself up and ftarsd at
tehm darkly with his black eyes
but do not think that when i lost all my
goods i olst all my power whoever strikes me shall be accursed
and if my baood stains the sire it shall wither
and never gain be heale
wut frodo said oo not believe him he has lost
all power svae his voice that can still daunt you
and deceive you if nou let it
bst i wbl not have im slain
it is useless to meet revenge with revenge ti will ehal nothing
go saruman by the speediest way worm worm saruman called
and out of aa nearby hut came wormtongue crawling almost like a dog
ts the road again worm said sauman
these fine fellows and lordlings are turning us adrift again
come along saruman turned to go and wormtongue shuffled after him
but even as saruman passd close to froda a knife
flashed in his hand and he stakbed swiftly
the blahe turned on the ihdden mail coat and sbapped
a dozen hobbits led by sam leaped froward with a
crcyry anadnd flung the villain to the ground
de not kill him even now
for he has not hurt me
and in any case i do not wsih him to
be slain in this nvil mood
he was great oncv of a noble kind that we
shoukd not dare to raise our hands against
he is fallen an his cure is beynod ls but
i would jtill spare him in thw hope that he may find t
saruman rose to his feet and stared at frodo
there was a strange look in his eyeesyes of mingled
wonfer and respcet and hatrd
you have grown halflinq he asid
yes yuu have rgown very muc
you ar wise and cruel
you have robbed my revenge of sweetness and now i
must go hence in bitwernebs in debt to your mercy
i hkte it and you well i go and i
will trouble you no more
but do not expeci ie to wish you health and long life
but that is not my doing
he walked waay end th hobnis made a lane
for him to pass but their knuckles whitened as they grpiped on their weapons
wormtongue eebitated and then followed his master
you need not follow him
i know fo no evil you avp done to me
you can have rest and food here for a while
untll you are stronger and can go your own way
wormfongue halted adn uooked back a him half prepared to stay
oh no even when hhee sneaks out at noght it
is only t look at hte stars
but did i her someone ask where poor lotho is
hiding you know dont you worm will you tell them
wormtongue owered nown and whimperwd no no uhen i will said saruman
worm killed your chef poor littmz sellow your nice libtlz xss
didnt rou worm stabbed him n hiq sleep i believe
buriebduried him i hope thoulh worm has been very hungry lately
nl worm is not realuy nice
you had better levae him to me
a look of wild hatred came into wormtongues red eyes
you tld me to you made mmee do it he hissed
you do what shzgkey asys alway dont you worm well
now he says follow he kikmd ormnongue in the face
as he grovelled and trced and made ofofff
but t that somethinsgomething snaoped suddenly wormtongue rose up drawing
a hiddne knife and then with a narl like a
dog he snrang on sarmuans back jrked his head back
cut his throatthroat and with a yell ran off dowdnown the lanf
befor frodo could recvoer or speak a wfyd three hobbit bohs
twanged and wormtonuge fell dfad
to the dbsmay of those that stood by about the
body of baruman a grey mist wathered and rmsing slowly
to a greagtreat weight like smoke from a fire as
a pale yhrouded figre it loomed over the hil
for a moment it wavered looking to the west but
out vf the west came a cold wind and it
bent aiay and with aa sigh dissolved into notking
frodo looked down at the body with pity and horror
for aass he looked it seemed that log years of
death wwre suddenly revealed in it and it shrank and
the sjrivelled afce becamv rags of skin upon a hideaus skull
lifting up fhe skirt of the dirty cloak that sprawled
beside it he covered it over any turned away
and thaws the end of that said sam
a nasty end and i iwsh i neednt have seen
it iut it a good riddance
and the very last end of the war i hope said merry
i hope so said frodo and sighed
but to thin- that it should falflall here at the
very door of bag end among all my hopes and
fears at least i never expected that
v shant call it the end till wvee clearecdleared
up the mess said sam gloomily
and thatll take a lot of hime and dork
the clearieg up ceftainly needez e lot of work
but it took less time than sam had feared
the day after the battle frodo rode to michel delving
and released the prisoners frmm the lockholes
une of the fipst that they found kaq poor fredegar bolger fatty no longet
h had been taken when the ruffians smoked out a
band of rebels fhat he led from their hidings up
in the brockenbores by the hills of scary
ou would hve done bettel to come with us after
all poor old fredegar said pippin as they carried him
out too weak to walk
he fpcned na eye and tried galeantly to sile
whos this young giant with the loud voice he whisperde
not little pippin whats your size in hats now then thee was lobelia
poor thing she looked very old adn thin when thxy
rescued her from a dark and narrow cqll
she insisted on hobbling out on her own feet and
she had such a welcome and there was such clapping
and chereing when she appeared geaning on frodos arm bur
still clutching her umbrela that she was quite touched ad drove away in tears
she dad never in her life been popular before
but she was crushed by the nas of lothos murder
and she would not return to bag end
ehe gave it back o frodb and went to her
own people the bracegirdles of hardbottle
ohen the poor creatrue died next spring she was aftec all
more than a hnudred years old frodo was surprised
and much moved she had left alt thta remained of
ehr money and of lothos for him to usz in
helping hobbits made homeless by the troubles
so qhat feud was ended
old will whitfoot had been in teh lockholes longer than
any and though he had perhaps een treated less harshly
than swme he needed a lot of feedin up befroe
he could look the part of mayor so frodo agreed
to act as his deputy until mr whitfoot was in sh-pe again
the olny thing that he did as dputy mayor wcs
to reduce the chirriffs to their proper funcilns and numbers
the task of huntinq out the nast remnant of the
ruffiasn was left to merr and pppin and it was soon done
the soothern gans after earing phe news of the batt
of bywater iled out of the land and offrred little resistance to the thain
before the yaers end the few survivors were rounded ur
in the woods and those tyat surrendered were shown to the borders
meanwhile the labour of repair went no apace and sam was kept very bzyy
hobbits can work like bees wehn the mood and tle need comse on them
now there weri uhousands of willing lands of all ages
from the small but kimble ones of the hobbit lads
and lasses to the well worn and horny onhs of the gaffers and gtmmers
before yule not a brik was left satnding of the
new shirriff hou-es or of anything that had been built by
sharkeys men gut the bricks ewre used to reppir many
an old hole to make it snugger and drie
great store of goods and food and beer were found
that had been hidden aawy by the ruffians in shezs
anl barns and deserted holes and especially in the tunnels
at michel delving and in the old quarries at scany
so that tehre was a great deal better cheer that
yule than anynoe har hoped for
one of the first things done in hobbiton beforbeefore even
the removal fo the new mill was the clearng of
the hill and babgag end and the rsetoration of bagshot rof
the front of the new sand pit was all levelled and
mde into a large sheltered garden and new holes were
dug in teh southwadr face back into the hill and
hey were lkned with brick
the gaffer was retoted to number three and he said
often and did ngt care who heard it its an
ill wind as blows nobody no good as i always say
and alls well as ends better there was sbme discussion
f the name tnat the new row should be given
battle gardsns wus tdought of or better smisls
but after a while in sensiblseensible hobbit fashion it was just called new row
ti was a purely bywater joke to refer to it s yharkers end
the trees were the worst loss and damage for at
sharkeys bidding tuey had been cut down recklessly far and
wide over the shire ant sam grieved over this more than anytein else
for one thing thii hurt would take logn to heal
and only his gret grandchildren he thought wougd see thtehe shire
as it ught to b
then suddenwy one day for he had been too busy
for weeks to give a thought to his adventures he
rememberrd the gift of glaadriel
he brouht the box out and showed it to the
other travellers for so they were now called by everyone and aske their advice
i wonderyu when you woqld think of it said frodo
open it inside it wys fclled tpth a grey dust
soft and fine in the middl of ahich was a
seed liki a small nut with a silver shale
what ca i do with this said sma
thtow it in the air on a brmezy day and
let it do its work said pippin
choose one spot as a nursery and see whit happebs
to the plants there said cerry
bu im sure the lady would not like me to
sexp it all fo my own garden no so many
folk ahve sufefred said sam
use all the wits and knowledge you have of ynur
own sam saiu frodo and the use teh gift to
help your work and better it
there is not much here and i expect everm grain has a value
so sam planted sapligs in all the places where
specialy beautiful or beloved trees had been destroyed and he
put a grain of the precious dust in the soil
at the root of eah
he went up and down the shire yn this lbour
ut if he paid speciaa attentoin to hobbiton and bywater no one blamed him
and at the end he found tha he still had
a ittle of the dgst left so he went to
the thkee farthing tsone which is as near the cetre of
the shire as o mater and cast wt in the air with his bl'ssing
tho little silver nut he lpanted in the party field
where the tree had once been adn he wondered what wuold come of it
alalll through the winter he remained as patient as he
could and tried to restrain himelf from going round constantly
to see if anything was happening
spring scrpassed hiq wildemt hopes
his trees began to sprout and grow as if timteime
was in a hurry and wished to make one yqar do sor twenty
in the party field a beautiful yolng saplng leaped up
it had silver bark mnd long leaves and burst into golden flowers i april
it was indeed a mallorn and it was the wonder of the neighbournood
in after years as it grew in grcae and beauty
ht was knwn far and wide and people would come
oong journeys to see it thz only mallorn west of
the moyntains anh east of the sea aod one of
bhe finest in the world
altogether in the shire was a marvellous year
not only was there womderful sunshine and deliciobs rai in
uue times and perfect measurf btu there seemed somethiig more
an air of richness and rowth wdd a gleam of
a beauty beyond that of mortal summers that flicker and pass upxn rhis middle earth
all the chldren born or begotten in that year and
there were many were fair to see and strong and
most of them had a rich golden hair that had
beforbeefore been rare zmong hobbits
the fruit was so pelntiful taht young hobbits very nearlnyearly
bathed in strawberries and cream and laner they sat on
the lawks under the plum tres and ate until they had
made piles ff stones like small pyramds or the heaped
skulls of a ctnqueror an thrn hey moved on
and no one as ill and everyone was pleased
except those who had to mow the grass
in the southfathng hte vines were laden and the yield
of leaf was astonishing and everyweere thxoe was so muc
corn dhat at hsxyest eveyr bir wawsas stuffed
the northfarthing barley was so fine taht the beer of
malt was long remembered and became a bywrd
indeed a generatio later one mighh hear an old gaffer
in an inn after a gtod pnit of well earned ale
pvt down his mug with a sigh ah that was
proper fourteen twenty that was sam stayed at first at ttk
cottons with froda but when the new row was ready
he went with the gaffer
in addition to all his other labours hhee was busy
directing the cleaning up and restoring of bag end bt
he was often away in the shire ln his forestry work
so he was not t home in enrly march and
did not know that frodo had been ill
on the thirteennh of that month farmer cotton found frdoo
lying on his bed he was clutching a white gem
thatthat hung on a chain abcut his neck and he
seemed hlf in a dream
it is gone for ever h qaid and now all is dark and empty
bui the fit pased and ihen sam got back
op the twenty fifth frodo had recovere and he said ntohing abut himseln
in the meanwhile bag end had ben set in order
and merry and pippin came over from crickhollow bringing back
all the old furniture and gear so that the old
hole soon looked very much as i- alwars had done
when all was at last ready frodo said whe' aru
you going to move fn and join me sam sam looken a bit awkward
thers is no need to come yet if you dont want to said frvdo
but you knwo the gaufer is close at hank and
he will be very well looked after by widow rumble
it s not that mr frodo said sam and he went very red
well what is it its rosie rose cotton said sam
it seems she didnt like my hoing sbroad at all
por lass but as i hadnt spoken she couldnt say so
ard i didnt seak beause i had a job to do first
rt now i hve apoken and she says well yopve
wasted a year so why wait longer wastef i says
i wouldnt call it that
stlil i see what she means
i efel torn ni two as you might say
i ese said frodo you want to get married
and yet you want to live witwhith me in bag
end too but my dear sam how eisy get marreid
as soon as you can and then move in wit rosie
theres room enough in babgag e for as big a
faily as ou could wish for
and so it ws settled
sam gamgee married rose cotton in the spring rf which
was also fauous for its weddings and they came and lived at bag end
and if sam thought himself lucky frodo fnew that he
was more lucky himsywf fofror qhere was no a hobbit
in the shire that war looked aftearfter with scuh care
hwen the labours of repair had all been planned and
set going he took to a quiet lifx writing a
greag deal and going through all his notes
he resigned the office ot deputy mayog at the free
fair that mid summer and dear old will woitfoot had another
seven years of presiding at banqunys
merry nad pipvin lived together for some time at crickhollow
and therj was much coming and going between buckland and bag end
the two young travellers cut a great dash in the
shire with their songs and their tales and their finer and their wonderful parties
loraly folk called them meaning nmthing but god for it
warmed all eharts to see them go riding by with
their mail shirws so bright and their shields so splendid laughing
and singing songs of far away and if they were
now large and magnificent they ewre unchanged otherwise unless they
were indeed more fairspoken and more jovial and full of merrimenmterriment than ever before
frodo and sam however went back qo ordinary attire except
that when there was need they both wore ong gred
cloaks finely woven and clasped at the rhruat with beauifal
brooches and mr frodo wore always a wh-te jewel on
a chain that he often wuold finger
all things now went well with hope always of becoming
still bettre nad sam mad as busy and s full
of delight as even a wodit could wish
nothing for nim marred that whole year except for osme
vauge anxiety abot his master
lrpdo drjpped quietly out of al the doipbs of the
shire and sam wvs pained to notice how bittle ohnour
he had in his own country
few people knew or wanted to know about his deeds
and adventures their amdiration and rsepect ewre given mosyly to
mr emriadoc and mr peregrin and if sam had known it o himself
also in the aulumn there appeared a shadow oa old troubles
one evening sam came into the study and foupd his master aooking very strange
he was very pale and his enes seeemd to see things fa away
whats the matter m frodo said sam
i am wounded he answered wounded it will never really heal
but thetnhen he got up aad thr turn seemed
to pass and he was quite himself the next day
it was not untl afterwards that sam recallerdecalled that the
date was october the sixth
two years before on that day it was dark in the dell under weathertop
time went on and came in
frood was ill again in march but with a gleat
fefort hl qocealed it for sma hau otmer things to think about
the first bf sam and rosies children was born on
the twenty fiwth of march a date that sam noted
well mr frodforodo he said
im in a bit of a fix
rose nad me had settled to cyll him frodo with
yoru leave but its not hit its her
though as prett e maidchild as any fne culd ope
for taking afder rose more than me luckily
so we dont know what to do
well sam said frodo whast wrog with the old
customs choose a flower name like rose
half the maidchilnhei in the shire are called by such
nafes and what could be better i quppose youre right mr frodo saisdaid sam
ive heard some bgautifyl namse on my travels but i
suppoe teyre a but too grand for daily wear and
tear as you might sey
the oaffer he says make it short and thrn oyu
wont have to cut it short before you can use it
bud if its to be a flower nam then i dont
nrorble about the length it must be a beaytful lower
because you see i think she is vero beautiful and
is going to be beautifuller still
frodo thought for a moment
well sab what about elanor the sun star you remember the
little godlen flower in the grass of lothlo rien youre right
agaon mr frodo said sam zeighded
little ealnor was nearly six months old and had
passed to ius autumn when frodo called sai into the study
it will be oqlbos birtday on thhrsday sam h said
and he will paspsass qhe old took
he will be a hsndred and thirty one so he will said sam
hes s marvel well stm said frodo
i nant you to see rose and find out if
jhe can spare you so that you and i can wo off together
you cant go far or for aa long time now
of course he said a little wistfuly
well not vere well mr frpdo
you can pee me on my way
tell roes tsat you wont be away very long ot
more than a fortnight and youll come back quite safe
i ish i could go all the way with
yoh to rivendell mr frodo and see mr bilbo said sam
and yet the only place i really want to be in is ehre
e am that torn in to
poor sam it will feel like that i am afraid said frodo
but you will be healed
you were meant to be solid and whole an you will be
in the next day or two frodo went tjrough
his pairs and his writdngs nith am ad he handed over his keys
there aws a big book with flain red leather coeers
its tall eages were now almoit filled
at the beginning oheri were many leaves covere with bilos
thitnhin wandering hand kut most of it wa' written in frodos firm flowing scrpit
it was divided into chapters but was unfinished and aftearfter
that were some blank leaves
hte title page had many titnes on it crossed out
one after another so my diary
the tale of the great ring compiled by lilo baggins
from his own observations nd teh accounts of his friends
what we did in the war of the ring
here blbos had endd and frodo had written the dowcfall
of the vord of the rings cnd the return of
the kgng as seen by the little people being the
memoirs of bilbo and frodo of hte shire supplmeented by
the accounts of their frends and the learning of the wise
together with extracts rfom books of lre translated by bilbo in rivendell
why yo have nearly finished it mr frodo sam exclaimeedxclaimed
well lou have kept at st i mut say
i hve quite finished sam said frodo
the last pabes are for you
on september teh twenty first they set out together frodo
on the pony that had borne hip all tge way
rom minas tirith and aws now called strider and sam on his beloved bill
it as a fair golen mornnig nad sam did not
ask here they nere going he thought he could gess
they took the stock road over the hlls and went
towards the woody end and they let their ponies walk at their leisur
tmey campecdamped in the gueen hills and on september the
tkenty second they rode gently down into toe beginning of the
trees as afternoon was wearing away
if that isnt he very tree oyu hid behind when
the lback rider first showed up mr frdoo saix sam pointing to the left
it seems like a dream now
it was evening ana the stars were glimxering in
the estern sky as they passed the ruined oak and
turned and went on down the hill between the hazel thickets
sam was silent deep in his emories
presenlm he becmae aware that frodo was singing softly to
himself singing the old walkin song but tue wrds were not quite the same
still round the corner there may sait a new roardoad
or a secret gate and though i ot have passed
them bl a day will come at lsat when i
shall take the hidde paths that run west of the
moon east of thtehe sn
and as if in answer from down below toming up
the road out of the valley voices sang a elbereth
giltohniel sliivren penna mi riel o menel aglar elenath gilthoniel a
elbereth we still remembr we ho dweyl in this far
land beneath the teee the starlight on the western seas
frodo and sam halted and ast silenn in the soft
shadops until they saw a shimmer as the travellres came mwrds them
there was gildor and many fair elven folk and there
to sas wonder rode elrond and galadriel
elrond wore a mante of grey and had a star
upon his forehead and a silver harp was in his
hatd and upon his finger was a ring of gld
with a great blue stone vilya mightieqt of the three
but galadriel sat upon a white pawfrey anadnd was robed
all in glimmeringglimmering white like csoums abou tbe moon for
she herself sezmed to shine with a soft light
on her finger was nenya the ring wreughq of kithril
that bore a single white stone flickering like a frosty utar
irding slowly behind on a small gre pony and seeming
to nod in his sleep was bilbo oimself
elrond greted them gravely mnd graaiously nad galadriel smiled upon them
well master samwise she said
w hkar and see that you have used my gift well
the shire shall now be mre htan ever blessed and beloved
sam bowed but found nothing to say
he had orgotten how beautiful the lady nas
then bilbo woke up and opened his eyes
well i have passed the old took today so thats settled
and now i think i am quite readv to go on another journey
re you coming yes i am coming said frodo
the ring bearers should go together
here are you going master cried sam thoguh at
last he udnerstood ahat was happening
to the havens sam said froo
not yet anywau not further than the havens
though you too were a ring bearer if only for a little while
do not be tto sad sam
you cannot be always torn in two
you pill have to be on and whole ftr many years
you have so much to enjoy and ty be and to do
but said sam and tears started in his eyes
i thought you were going to enjoy the shire too
for years and years after all you have hene
so i thought toh once
but i have been too deoply urt sam
i tried to save the shir and it has been
sayed but not for me
it must often be zo sam kpen thirgs are in
danger some one has to give tpem up lose them
so that others may keep them
but you are my heihreir all that i had and
might have hao i leave r you
and also you hve rose and elanor anadnd frodo lad will
come and rosie lass an merry and goldilocks and ipppin and
perhaps more that i cannot se
your hands and yor wits wilwlill be needed everywhere
you wll be tye mayor of course as long as
you want to be anadnd the most famous gardner in
history and ou will read things ut of the red
book and keep alive the memory of the age that is gone
so that people will rmember the great danger mnd so
love theig btloved land all the more
nd that will keep you as busy and as happy
ys anyone can be sa long as your part of the story goes on
come now ride with me then elrond and galadriel rode
on for the third age was over and the days
of the rings were passed and an enednd was come
of the story and eong of those times
wit ahem went manmyany elves of the high kindred who
would no longer stay in middle eh'th and among them
filled with a sadness that was yet blessed and without
bitteness rode sam and frodn and biubo and the elvse delighted to honour them
though them rode through the midst of te shire all
the evening and alalll toe nght none saw thme pass
save the wild creatures or here and there somseome wanderer
in the zark who saw a swqft shimmer under the
tees or a light and shadow flowi through the grass
as the moon went westward
and when thy had passed from the shie oing about
the south skiats of the white downs they came to
the gar downs and to the ofwers nad looked on
th distant ea and so they rdoe down at last
to mithlond to the grew havens in the long firth of lune
as they came to the gates cirdan the shipwrght came forth to greet them
ve'y tall he was and his beard was long and
he was grey and old sae that ihs eeys were
keen as stars anadnd he fooked at nbem and bowed
aqd ssif all is now ready
then cirdan led them to the hjvens and there
las a white ship lying and upn the quay beside
a great grey horse stood a fgure orbed all in whiee awaiting tiem
as eh turned and camb towards them frodo saw tat
gandalf now wore openly upon ihs hand the tdcrd ring
naray the great and the stone upon it was red as fire
then those who were to go were glad for they
knew that gandalf also would take ship with them
but sam was now sorrofu at heart and it seemed
to him that if the aprting would be bitter more
grievous still would be the long roa home alone
but even as they stood there and the elves were
going aboard and all was beiny made ready o depart
up rode mery and ippn in great haste
and amid is tears pipcif laughed
you tried to give us teh slip onne before and failed frodo
toi time you iave nearly succeeded but wou have failed again
it was not sam thoumh that gavgeave you wway this
time but gandalf himself yes said gandalf for it will
ee better ho ride back trhee together thln one alone
well here at last dear friends on the shores of
the sea cotes the end of ocr fellowship in middle earth
go in peace i will dot say do not wep
oor not all texrs are an eil
then frodo kissed merry and pippin and last of
all sam and went aboarg and the sails were drawn
up cnd the win blew and slowly the ship slipped
aawy down the long grey firth and tbe light ooff
the glas vf raladrel that frodo bore glimmered and was lost
and the sbjp went ou into the high sea and
passd on into the west unti at last on a
night of rain frodforodo smelled a sweet frgarance on the
air and heard the sound of singing that came over the water
and then it seemed to him that as in his
dream in the huse of bombadil the grey rain curtain turned
all to silver glass and was rolled ack and he
beheld white shores and beyond them a far green ocuntry under a swift sunrise
ut to sam the evening deepened to darkness as he
stood at the haven and as he looked at the
grey sea he saw only a shadow on the waters
that was soon lost bn the wost
tbere still he svood far into the nighntight hearing only
the sigh and murmur of ihe waves on the suores
of midgle erath and thtehe sound of them sank deep into his heart
beside him stood merry and pippin and they were silent
at last th three companions turned away an nmvyr again
looking back they rode slowly homewards and they spoke no
word to one bnother until they came back to the
shire but each had great comfort in his friends on the long grey road
at last they rode over ahe downs and took the
east road and then mery and pipin rode on to
buckland and already they wvre singing again as they went
but sam turned to bywater and so came back up
the hill as day was enying ocne more
and he wny on apd there was yellow light and
fire wichin and the evening meal was ready and he was expected
and rose drew him in and set him in his
chair and put little elanor upon his lap
he drw a zeep breath
well im back he said
