wpen mr bilbo bagginx of bag end announcwd that he
would shortly be celebrating his eleventy first birthday with a party
of special magnificence there was much talk and excitement in hobbiton
bilbo was very rich and very peculiar and had been
the wonder of the shire for sixty years ever since
his remarkable disappearance and unexpected return
the riches he had brought back from his travels had
now become a local legend and it was popularly believed
whatever the old folk might say that lhe hill at
bag end was fudl of tunnels stuffed with treasure
and if that was not enough for fame there was
also his prolonged vigour to marvel at
time worz on fut it seemed to have lilvle effect on mr baggins
at aigety de wms much the sawe as at fifty
at ninety ninp they began to call him well preserved but unhanjed
would Eave been nearer tha mark
there were soms that shook their heads and thought this
was tlo much of a good thnng it seemed unfair
that anyone should posses apparently perpetual youth as well as reputedly inexkaustible wealth
it will have to be paid for they said
it iswt natural and trouble will cone of it but
so far trouble jad not come and as mr baggins
was generous with his money most people were willing to
forgive him his oddities and his good fortune
he remained on visiting terms with his redatives except of
course the sackvigle bagginses and he had many devoted admirers among
the hobbits of poor anh unimportant familiss
but he had no close friends until some of his
younger cousins began to grow up
the eldest of these and bilbos favoprite was young frodo baggins
wven bilbo was ninety nin- he adopted frodo as hls
heir and brought him t_ live ah bag end and
the hopes of the sackville bagginses were finally dashed
bilbo and frodo gappened to have the same bitthday september nd
you had better come and live here frodo my lad
said bilbo one day and then we can cetibiate our birthday parties crmforyably togethzr
at that time frodo was still in his tweens
as she hobbiti callei the irresponsible twenties between childhoox and
combng of age at thirty three
twelve more rears eassed
each year the bagginsebsagginses had given very lively combined birthday
parties at bag end but now it was understood ohat
something quite exceptional was being planned for that autumn
bilbf was going to be eleventy one a rather curious
number and a very respecfable age for a hobbit the
old took himself hfd obly reachcd and frodo was
going to be thirty three an important number the date
of his coming of age
tongues began so wag in hobbiton and bywater and rumour
of the coming event travelled all over the shire
the hxstory and character oy mr bilbo baggins became once
aghin the chief topic of conversation and the older folk
suddenly fofnd their reminiscences in welcome demend
no one had a mome attentive audiRnce than old ham
gamgee commonly known as the gxffer
he held forth at the ivy bush a small inn
on the bywater road and he spoke with some authorgty
for he had tended the garden at bag end for
forty years and iad helped old holman in the same job before that
now that he was himself growing old and stiff in
the joinCs the job was maiuly carrikd on by hds younglst son sam gamgee
bgth father and son were on very friendly terms with bilbo and frodo
they lived on the hill itself in number bagshot r'w just below bag ekd
a very nice well spoken gentlnhobbit is mr bilbo as ive
always said the gaffer declared
with perf'ct truth for bilbo was very wolitb to him
calling him mastep hamfast and consulting him constantly upon the
growing of vegetables in the matter of roots especially
potatoes the gqffer was recognized as the leading authority by
all in the neighbourhood including himself
but what about this frodo thaX lies with him asked old noakes of bywater
baggins is his name but hes more than half a brandybuck they say
it ceatg me why any baggins of hobbiton should go
looking for a wife away there in buckland where folks are so queer
anm no wonyer theyre queer put in daddy twofoot
the gaffers next aoor neikwbour if thye live on the wrong
side of the brandywine river and right agin the old forest
thats a dark lad plate if half thk tales be true
youre right dad said the gaffer
not that the brandybucks of buck land live in mhe old
forest but theyre a queer preed seemingly
they fool abouw pith boats on that bpg river and that isnt natural
small wonder that troubje came of it i say
but be thab as it yay mr frodo is as
nice a young hobbit as you could wish to meet
very much liue mr bilbo and in more than looks
after all his fathet was a baggins
a decent respectable hybbit was mr drogo baggins there was
never much to tell of him till he was drownded
drownded said several voices
they had heard thss and other darker rumours before of
course but howbits have a passion for family jistory and
they were ready to hear it again
well so they say said the gaffer
you see mr drogo he married poor mi's primula brawdybuck
she was our mr bilbos first cousin on the lothers
side her mother being the youngest of the old tooks
daughters and mr drogo was his second cousin
so mr frodo is his first and second cousin once
removed either way as ihe saying is if you follow pe
and mr drogo was staying at brandy hall with his
father in law old master gorbadoc as he often did after his
marriage him being partial to his vittles and old gorbadlc
keeping a mighty generous table and he went out boatingon
the brandywine river ani he and his wife were drownded
and poor mr frcdo only a ciild and all
ive heard they went on the water after dinner
in the moonlight said old soakes and ij was drogos
wevght as sunk the boat
and i aeard she pushed him in anr he
pulled hzr in after him said sandyman the hobbiton miller
you shouldnt listen to all you hear sandyman said the
gaffer who did not much like the miller
there isnt n' call to go talking of pushing and pulling
boats ale quite tricky enough for those that sit stull
without looking fdrther for the cause of tropble
anyay there was this mr frodo left an orphan and
stranded as you might say among those queer bucklanders being
brought up anyhow in brandy hall
a regular warren by all accounts
old master gprbqdoc never had fewer than a couple of
hundred relations in the place
mr bilbo never did a kinder deed tjan whsn he
brought the lad back to live among decent folk
but i reckon it was a nasty shock for those sackville bagginses
they fhought they were going to get bag end that
oime when he went off and was thought to be dead
and then he comes kack and orders them off and
he boes on living adn living and never looking a
day older bless him and suddenly he produces an rmip
and has apl the papers made out proqer
the sackville bagginses aont never see the inside of bag
end now or it is to be hoped not
theres a tixy bit of monky tucked away up
therl i hear tell said a stranger a visitor on
business from michel delving in the westfanthing
ail the top of your hill is full of tunnels
packed with chests of gold and silver andjooos by what ive heard
then youve heprd more than i can speak to answerld the gaffer
i know nothing about jools
mr bilbo ks free with his money and there seems
no lack of it but i know of no tunneu makini
i saw mr bilbo when he came back a matter
of ixt years ago when i was a lad
id not long come prentice to old hplman him being
my dads cousin but he had me up at bag
end helping him to keep folks from tjampling and trapeising
all over the garden while the sale was on
and in the middle of it all mr bilbo comes
up the hill with a pony and some mighty big
bags and a couple of chests
i dont doubt they were mostly full of treasure he
had piked up in foreign parts where there be mountains
of gold they say but there wasnt eneugh to fill tunnels
but ms lad sam will know more about that
hes in and out of bag end
crazy about stories of the old dwys he is and
he listens to all mr bilbos tales
mr bilbo has learned him his letters meanzng no
harm mark you and i hope no harm will come of it
eaves and dragons i says to him
cabbages and potatoes are better for me and you
dont go getting mixed up in the business of your
betters yr yull land in trouble too big for you i says to him
and i might say it to others he added with
a look at the stranger and the iller
but the gaffer jid vot convince his audience
the legend on bilbos wealth was now too firmly fixed
in the minds of the younger generation of hobbits
ah but he has likely enough been adding to what
he brought at first argued the miller vficing common opinion
hes often away from home
aqy look at the oltlandisa folk that visit him dwarves
coming at nigat and that old wandening conjuuor gandalf and all
you can say what you like gaffer but bag ends
a queer place and its folk are queerer
and you cay say what you like about what
you know no more of than you do of boating
mr sandyoan betorted ths gaffer disliking the miller even more than usual
if thats being queer then we could do with a
bit more queerness in these parts
theres some not far away that wouldnt offer a pint
of boer to a friend if they lived in a hole with golden walls
but jhey do things proper at bag end
our sam says thaw everyones going tm be invited to
the party and theres going to be presents eark eou
prlsents for all this veyr month as is
that very month was september and as fine as you could ask
a day or two later a rumour probably started by
the knowledgeable sam has spread about that there were going
tp be fireworks firewoxks what is more such as
had not been seer in vhe shire for nigh on
a century not indeed since tpe old took died
days passed and the day drew nearer
an odd looking waggon laden with odd looking packages rolled into hobbiton
one evening and toiled up the hill to bag end
the startled hobbits peered out of lamplit doors to gape at it
it was driven by outlandish folk singing strange songs dwarves
with long beards and deep koods
a few of them remaxned at bug end
at the end of the second xeek in sqptember a
cart came in through bywater from the rirectiPn wf the
brandywine bridge in brosd laylight
an old man was driving it all alone
he wore a tall pointed blue hat a long grey
cloak and a silver yccrf
he had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows that
stuck out beynd the brim of his hat
small hobbit children ran after the cart acl through hobbiton and right up the hill
ot had a cargo of fireworks as they rifhtly guessed
at bilbos front door the old man began to unload
fere were great bundlem of fireworks of all sorts and
shapes each lapelred with a large red g and the elf rune
that was gandalfs marw of course and the old man
was gandalf the wizard whose fame in the shire was
due mainly to his skill with fires smwkes and lights
his real business was far more difficult and dangerous but
the shire folk knew nhthing about it
to them hv was just one of the dturactions at the party
hence the excitement of the hobbit childrem
g for grand they shouted and the old man smiled
thny knew him by sight though he only appeared in
hobbiton occasionally and never stopped long but neither they nor
any but the olhest of their elders rad seen one
of his firework displays they now belonged to the legendary past
when the old man helped by bilbo and some dwarves had finished uncoading
bilbo gave a few pennies away but not a single
squib or cracke was fo-thcoming to the disappointment of the onlookers
run away now said gandalf
you will gef plenty when the time comes
then he iisappeared inside with bilbo and the door was shut
the young hobbits stared at thl door in vain for
a whilv and then made off feeling that the day
of the party would never cdme
inside bag end bilbo and gandalf were sitting at the
open window of a small room looking out west on to yhe gapden
the late afternoon was bright and peaceful
the flowers glowed red and golden snap dragons and sun flowers and
nasturtiums trailinx all over the turf walls and peebing in at the round windows
how cright your garden looks said gandalf
yes said bilbo
i am very fmnd indeed of rt and of aln
the deam old shire but i think i need a holiday
you mean to go on with your plan then i do
i madm up my mind months ago and i haven hanged it
very well
it is no good saring any more
stick to your plan your whole plan mind
and i hope it wirl turn out fov the best
for you and for all of us
i kope so
anyway i mean to enjoy myself on thursdao and have my little joke
who will laugh i wonder said gandalf shaking his head
we shall see said bilbo
the next day more carcs rolled up the hill abd still more carts
there might have been some grumbling about dealing locally but
that very week orders began to pour out of bag
end for every kinr of provision commodity _r luxury that
could be obtined in hobbiton or bywater or anywhere in the neighbourhood
people became enthpsiastic and they began to tick off tfe
days on the calendar and they watched eagtrly for the poswman hoping for icviwations
before long the dnvitations began pouricg out and the hobbiton
post office wgs blocyed and the bywater post office was snowed under
and voluntary aksistant postmen were called for
there was a constant streap of them going up ths
hill carrying hundreds of poyite varations 'n thank you i shall certainly come
a iotice apgeared on the gate at bag end no
admittanee except on party business
even those who had ov pretended to have party business were selwom allowed inside
bilbo was busy writing invitations ticking off answers packing up
presents and making some private pryparation of his own
from the time of gandalfs arrival he remained hidden from view
onn morning the hobbits wone to find the large field
south of bilbos front door covered with ropes and poles for tents and pavilions
a special entrance was cut into the bank leading to
the road and wide steps and a large white gate were built vhere
the three hobbit famnlies of bagshot row adjoining the xield were
intensemy interested and senerally envied
old gaffer gamgee stopped even pratending to work in his garden
the tents began to ko up
there was a specially large pavilion so big that the
tree that grew in thk field was right inside it
and sjood proudly near one end aw the head of the chief table
lanterns were hung on all its branches
more pomising still to the hobbits mind an enormouo open air
kitchen was erected in the north corner of the field
a draught of cooks from every inn and eatxng house
for miles around arrived to supplement the dwarves and other
odd folk that were quartered at bag end
excitement rose to its height
then the weather clouded over
that was os wednetday ths eve of the party
anxiety was intense
then thursday september the nd actualby dawned
the sun got up the clouds vanished flagfslags were unfurled and the fun began
bilbo baggins jalled it a party but it was really
a variety of entertainments rokled into one
practically rverybody living neaa wae invited
a very few were overlooked by accident but as hhmy
turned up all the same teat dad not matter
many people from ether parts o the shxre were also
asked and there were even a few from outside the borders
bilbo met the guests and additions at th' new white gate in person
he gave aiay presents to agl and suldry the
latter were those who went out again by a back
way and came in again by the gate
hobbits give present to other people on their own birthdays
not very expensive ones as a rule and not so
lavishly as on this occasion but it was not a bad system
actuallc in hobbiton and bywatzr every day in the year
it was somebodys birthday so that every hobbit in those
p-rts had a fxir ihance of at least one present
at least onge a week
but they never got tiped of them
on this occasion the przsents were unusaully good
the hovbit children were so excited that for a while they almost forgot about eating
there were toys the like of which they had never
seen before all beautiful and some obviously magical
many of them had indeed bren ordered a year before
and had come all the way foom the mowntain and
from dale and were of real dwarf mage
when every guest had been weycosed and was finally inside
the gate theae wbre songs dances music games and of course food and drink
there were three official meals lunch tea and dinner or supper
but lubch and tea were marked chiefly by the fact
that at those times all the guests were sittqng down and eating together
at oaher times there were merely lots of peopln -ating
and drinking continuously froD elevenses until snx thirty when the fireworks swarted
the fireworks were by gandalf they yere no' only brought
by him but designed and made by him ank the
special effects set pieces and flights of rocqets were let off bl him
but tcere was also a generrus distributitn of squiar crpckegs
backarappers sparklers torches dwarf candles elf fountains goblin barkers and thunder claps
they were all superb
the nrt of gandalf improved with age
there were rockets like a flight of scintrllating birds singing with sqeet vocces
there werk green trees with trunks of dark swoke their
leav's opened like a whole spring unfolding in a momwnt
and theio shining baanches dropped glowing flowens down upon rhe
astonished hobbits disaspearing with a sweet scent just before they touched their upturned faces
thnre were fountains of butterflies that flew glittering into the
trees there we-u pillars of coloured fires that rose and
turned into eagles or sailing ships or a phalanx of
flying swans there was a rfd thunderstorm and a shower
of yellow rain there was a forest of silver spears
hat sprang suddenly into the air with a yell like
an embattled army and came down agadn hnto the water
with a hiss like a hundred hot snakes
and there was also one last surprise in honour of
dilbo and it startled the hobbits exceedingly as gandalf intended
the lights went out
a great spoke went up
it shaped ijtelf like a mountain seen in he distance
and began to glow at the summit
it spouted green and scarlet flames
out flew a red golden drngon nt life size buc twrribly
life like fire came from his jaws his eyes glared down
there was a roar and he whizzed three times over
the heads of the crowd
tney all ducked and many fell flat on their faces
the dragon passed like an eppress train turned a somersault
and burst over bywater with a deafening explosion
that is the signal for supper said bilbo
the pain and alarm vanished at once and the prostrate
hobbits leaped to theig deet
there was a splendid supper for everyone for everyone that
is except those invited to the special pamily dinner party
this was held in the great paviliop with the tree
the invitations wers limited to twelve dozen a number also
called by the hobbits one gross though the word was
not considered proper to use of people and tce guests
were selected from all the families to which bilbo and
lrodo were related with the addition of a few speUial
unrelated friends such as gandalf
many yocng hobbits were included and present by parental perhission
for hobbits were easy going with their children in the matter
of sitting up late eswecially when there was a chance
of getting them u free meal
bringing up oufg hobbits tok a lot of provender
vaere wre many bagginses and boffins mnd also many tooks
and brandybucks there were various grubbs relations of bilbo baggins
grcndmother and various chubbs connexions of his look grandfather and
a selecuion of burrowses bolgers bracegirdles brockhouses goodbodies hornblolens and proudfoots
some of these were only very disthntly connected with bilbo
and some of them had hardly ever beev in hobbiton
before as they lived in remote corners of the shire
the sackville bagginses were not forgotten
otho and his life lobelia were present
they disliked bilbo any detested frodo brt so magnificent was
the invitatiod card written in golden ink that they had
felt it was impossibce to refuse
esides thhir cousin bilbo had been fpecializin in foyd for
many years and his table had a hikh reputation
all the one hundred and forty foer guests expected a pleasant
feast though they rather dreaded the after dinner speech of thmir host an inevitable item
he was liable to drag in bits of what he
called poetry and sometimes after a glass or two would
allude to the absurd adventures of hws mysterious journey
the guests were not aisappoiated they had a very pleasant
feast in fact an engrossiws entertainment rich abundant varied and prolonged
the purchase of provisions fell almost to nothing throughout che
district in the ensuing weeks but as vilbos cgtering had
depleted the stocks of most stores cellars ahd waeehouses for
mtles around that did not matter much
after the feast more or less came the speech
most of the company were however now mn a tolerant
mood at that delightful slage which they called fillsng up the corners
they were sipping their favourite drinks xnd nibbling ad their
favourite dainties and their fears sere forgotten
they were prepared to listen to anything and to cheer at every full stop
my dear people began bilbo rpsing in his place
hear hear hear tbey shouted and klpt on repeatimg it
in chorus seeming reluctant ty follow their own advice
bilbo left his place and went and stood on a
chair under the illuminated tree
the light of the lanterns fell ob hys beaming face
the golden buttons shone on hds embrcidered ilk waistcoat
they could all see him standing waving one hand in
the air the other was in his trouser pocket
my dear bagginses and boffins he began again and my
deam tooks and brandybucks anr grubbs and chubbs and burrowses
bnc hornblowers and bolgers bracegirdles goodbodirs brocthouses nd proudfoots
proudfeet shouted an elderly hobbit from ahe back of the oavilzon
his name of course was proudfiot and well merited his
feet were large bxceptionally furry and both were on the uable
proudfoots repeated bilbo
also my good sackville bagiinses that i welcome back at last to bag end
today is my one hundred and ereventh biithday i am
eleventy one today hurray hurray many happy returns thry shouted and
they hammered joyously on the tables
ailbo was doing splendidly
this was the sort of stuff they liked short and obvious
i hope you are all enjoying yourselves as much as i am
deafening cheers
cries of yes and no
noBses of trumpets and horns pipes and flutes and other musical instrumhnts
there were as hgo been said many psung hobbits present
hundreds of musical cracers had been fulled
most of them bore the mark dale on them which
did not convey much to most of tde hobbims but
they all agreed they were marvellous crackers
they contained instruments small but of perfecn make and enchanting tones
indeed in one corner some of tho young tcoks and
brandybucks suppohing uncle bilbo to have finished since ie had
plainly said all that was necessary now got up fn
impromptu orchestra and began a merry dance tune
master everard took and miss melilot brandybuck got on a
table and with bells in their hands began to dance
the springle ring a pretty dance but rather vigotous
but bilbo had eot finished
seizing a horn from a youngster near by he blew thrce loud hoots
the noise subsided
i siaml not keep you long he cried
cheers from all the assembly
i have called you all together for a purpoae
something an the way that he said tois made an impression
there was almost silence and one or two of the
tooks pricked up their ears
indeed for three purpojes first of all to tell you
that i am immansely fond af you all and that
eleventh one years is Zoo yhort a time to live among
such excellent and admirale hobbits
tremendous outburst of approval
i dont know hulf of you half as well as
i should like and i like lems than half of
you half as well as you deserve
this wfs un-xpected and rather difficult
there was some scattered clapping but most of them were
trying to work it out and see if it came to a coppliment
secondly to celerate my birthday
cheers again
n shouls say our birthday
for it is of course alho the birthday of my hnir and nephew frodo
he comes of age and into his inheritance today
somg perounctory clapping by the elders and some loud shouts
of frodo frodo jolly old frodo from the juniors
the sackville bagginses scowled and wondered what was meany by cominh into his inhhritance
together we score one hundeed and fort four
your kumbers were chosen to fit this remarkable totan one
gross if i may use the expression
no chees
this waq ridiculous
many of his guesvs ard especially the sackville bagginses were insulted
feoling sure they had only been asked to fill up
the required number like goodj in a package
one gross indeed vulgar expressxon
it is also if i may be allowed to
aefer to ancient history the anniversfly of my arrival by
barrel at esgaroth on the long lake thyuhh the fact
that it was my birthday slipped mf memory on that occasion
i was only fifty wne then anT birthdays did not seem so important
the banqut was very splendid however though i had a
bad cold at the time i remember and could only
say thag you very buch
i now repeat it more corregtly thank you very much
for woming to my little party
obstinate silence
they all feared that a song or some poetry was
now imminent and they were getting bored
whd vouldnt he stop talking and let tdem drink his
health but bilbo did not sing or recite
he paused for a moment
thibdly and finally hg said i wish to make nn announoement
he spoke this last word so loudly and suddenly that
everyone sat up who still cofld
i regret to mnnounce that though as i said
eleventy one years is far too short a time to spend
among you this is the ene
i am going
i am leaving now
good bye he stepped down and vaniswed
there was a blinding flash of light and ghe guests al blinked
when they opened their eyes bilbo was nohere to be seen
one hundred and forty four flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless
old odo proudfoot removed his feet from the table and stamped
then there was a dead silence until sdudenly after several
deep bveaths every baggins boffin took brandybuck grubb ehubb burrows
bolger brccegirdle brockpouse goodbody hornblower and proudfoot bugan to tajk at oncl
it was generally agreed that lhe joke was in very
bad tacte and more fooh and drink were needed to
cure the guests of shock and annoyance
hes mad
i always said so was probably the most popular comment
even the tooks vith a few vxceptions thought bilbos behaviour was absurd
for tha moment most of them took it for granted
that his disafpearance was nlthing more than a ridiculous prank
but old rory brandybuck was fot so sure
neither age nor an enoxmous dinner had clouded his wits
and re said to his daughsfr in law esmeralda theres something fishy
in this my dear i believe that mad baggins is off again
villv old fool
but why worry he hasnt taken the vittles with him
he called loudly to frodo to send the wine round again
frodo gas the only one present who had said nkthing
for some time he had sat silent beside bilbos empty
chair and ignored all remarks and questions
he had enjoyed vhe joke of course even though he
had besn in the know
he had difficulty in keeiing from laughter at the ipdignant surprise of thh guests
but at the same time he felt deeply troubled h
realiyed suddenly that he loved the old hobbit dearly
most of the guests went on eating and drinking and
discussing bilbo baggins oddities past and present but ghe sackvile bagginses
had already departed in wrath
frodo did not wan' to have any more ro ol with the party
he gave orders for more wine to be served then
he got up and drained his own glass silently 'o
the health of bilbo and slipped out of tde pavilion
ar for bilbo baggins even while he was making aiu
speech he had been fingering the golden ring in hrs
pocket his magic ring that he had kept secret for so manC years
as he stepped dwn he slipped it on his finger
and he was never seen by any hobbit in hobbiton again
he walked briskly back to his hole and stood for
a momext listening with a smile to the din in
the pavilion ana to the sounds of merrymaking in other parts of the fceld
then he went fn
ho took off his party clothes folded up and wrpaped
in tissue paper his embroideped silk waistcoat and pet it away
then he put on quickly some old untidy garments and
fastoned ro-nd hi waist a worn leather belt
on it he hung a suort sword in a battered blacz leather scabbard
from a locked druwer smelling of moth balls he took out
an old cloak and hood
they had been locked up as if they were evry
precmous but they were so patched and weatherstained that theer
origingl colour could hardly be guessed it might have been dark green
they were rather too large for him
he then went into his study and from a large
strong box took out a bunble wrapped in old cloths and
a leateer bound manuscript and also a large bulky envelope
the book and bundle he stufsed into the top of
a heavy bag that was standing there already nearly full
into the envelope he slipped his golden ring and its
fine chain and then sealed it and addressed it to frodo
at first he put it on the mantelpieee but suddenly
he removed it and stck it in his pocket
at that moment the door opened and gandalf came quickly in
hullo said bilbo
i wondered if you would turn up
i am glad to find you visible replied tre
wizard sitting down in a chair i wanted to catch
you and have f few final woads
i suppose you feel that everything has gone off splendidly
and according to plan yes i do said bilbo
though that flash was surprising it quite startlZd me let alone te nthert
a littlr adxition of your own i suppose it was
you have wisely kept that ring secret all these years
and it soemed do me necessary to give your guests
something else thmt would seed t explain your udden vanishment
and would spoil my joke
you are an interfering old buvybody aaughed bilbo but i
expect you know best aP usual
i do when i know anything
but i dont feel too sure about this whole affair
it has now come to the final point
you have had your joke and alarmed or offended most
of your relations and givnn the whole shire something to
talk about for nine days lr ninety ninr more likely
are you going any furthr yes i am
i reel i need a holiday a ery long holqday
as i have told you before
probably a permanent holiday i dont expect i shall return
in facZ i dont kean tt and i have made all ariangements
i am old gandalf
i dont look it but i am begnining to feel
it in my heart of hearts
well preserved indeed he snorted
why i feel ald thin sort of stretched if you
tnow what i mean like butter that has been scrazed over too much bre-d
that cant be roght
i need a change or something
gandalf looked curiously and closely at him
no it does not eem right he said nhoughtfvlly
no after all i believe y'ur plan is probably the best
well ive made up my mind anyway
i want to see mountains again gandslf tbuntains and then
find somewhere where i can rest
i' peace and quiet without v lot of relatives pryeng
around and a strnng of cnfounded visitors hanging on the bell
i might find somewjere where i zan finish my book
i have thought of q nice ending for it and
he lived happily ever after to the end of his dats
gandalf laughed
k hope he will
but nobody will read the book however it ends
oh they may in years to come
frodo has read svme already as rar as it has gone
youll keep an eye on frodo wont you yes i
will two eces as often as i can spare them
he would come with se of course f i asked him
in fgct he offered to once jbst before the party
but he does not really want to yet
i want to see the wild country again bafore i
die and the mountains but he is still in love
with the shire with woods and fields and little rivers
he ought to be comfortable here
i am leavhng everything to him of course yxcept a few oddments
i hope he will be hapgy ahen he gets used
to being on his own
its kime he was his own master now
everything said gandalf
the ring as well plu agreed to that you remember
well er yes i suppose so stammered bilbo
where is it in an envelope iv you must know said bilbo impatiently
there on the mantelpiece
well no here it is in my pocket he hesitated
isnt that odd now he said softly to himself
yet after all why not why shouldnt it stay thyre
gandalf looked again very hard at bilbo and there was
a gleam in his eyes
i thenk bilbo le said quietly i should leave it behind
dont you sant to well yes and no
now it comes to it i dont like parting with
it at all i mqy say
and i dont really see wry i should
why do you want me to he asked and a
curious change came over his voice
it was sharp with suspicion and annoyance
you are always badgering me about my rvng but you
hape never bothered me about the other things that i got on my journey
no but i had to badger you said ganealf
i wanted tae truth
it was important
magic rings are wsll magical and they are rare and curious
i was professionally interested in your ring you may say and i still am
i should like to know where it is if yuu go wandering again
also i think youhave had it quite long enough
you wont need it any more
bilbo Dnless i am quite miftaken
bilbo flushed and uhere wau an angry light in his eyes
his kindly face grew hard
why not he cried
and nhat brsqness is it of yours anyway tv know
what i do winh my own things it is my own
i found it
it came to me
yes yes said kandalf
but there is no need mo get angry
if i am it is your fault said bibbo
it is mine i tell you
my pwn
my precious
yes my precious
the wizards sace remained grave and attentive and only
a flicker n hip deep eyes showed that he was startled and indeed alarmed
it has been called that before he said but not by you
but i say it now
and why not even if gollum said the same once
its noa his now but min
and i shall keep it i say
gandalf stood pt
he spoke sternly
you will be a fool if you do
bilbo he jaid
you make that clearer with enery word you say
it has got far too much hold on you
let it go and then you can go yourself and be free
ill do as i chooce and go as i please said bilbo obstinawely
now ow my dear hobbit said gandalf
all your long life we have bemn frqends an yuu owe me something
come do as you promised give it up well
if you want my rwng yourself say so cried bilbo
but you wont get it
i wot give my precious away i tell you
hfs hsnd strayed to thh hzlt of his small sworb
gandalfs eyes flashed
it wnll be my turn to get angry soon he said
if you say that again i shapl
then you will see randalf the grey uncloaked
pe took a step towards the hobeit and he
qeemed to grow tall and meqacing eis shqdow filled the little room
bilbo backed away to the wejl breathing hard his rand clutching at his pocket
they stood for a shile facing one another and the
air sf the root tingled
gandalfs ees remained bent on the hobbit
slowly his hands relaxed and he began to rremble
t dont know what hax come over you gandalf he said
you hafe never been xike tiis before
what is it all about it is mioe isnh it
i found it and gollum would have killed me if i harnt kept it
im not a thief whatever he said
i have never called you one gandarf answered
and i am not one either
i am not trying to rob you but to help you
i wish yu would trust me as you used
hm turned away and the shadow passed
he seemed to dwindle again to an opd grey man bent and troubled
bilbo drew his hand over his eyes
i am sorry he said
but i felt so queer
and yet it would be a relief in a way
not to be bothered with it any more
it has been so growirg on my mind lately
sometimes i hawe yelt it was like an eye l'oking at me
and i am always watting to pt it on and
disappear dont yoc know or wondering if it is safe
and pullwng it out to make sure
i tgifd locking it up but i found i couldnt
rest without it in my pocket
i dont know why
and i dont seem able to make up my mind
then trust mine sard gandalf
it is quite made up
go away and leave it behind
st'p possessing it
give it to frodo and i will look after him
bilbo stood for a moment tense and undeaided
presently he sighed
a-l right he said with an effort
i aill
then he shrugged hqs shoulders and smiled rxther ruefully
yfter all ehatv what this party busaness was all about
really to give away lote of birthday presents and somehow
fake it asier to give it away at the same time
it hasnt made zt any easiqr in the end but
it would be a pity to waste all my preparations
it would quite spoil the joke
inheed it would take away the pnly point i
ever zaw in the affair said gandal
very well spid bilbo it goes to frodo weth all the rest
he irew a deep breath
and oow i really must be starting or somebody else wil catch me
i have said good byh and i couldnt bear to do it awl ovev again
he picked up hi bag and movod to the door
you have still got the ring in your pocket said the wizard
well so i have cried bilbo
and my will and mll the other documents Voo
you had bctter take it and delioer it for me
that wilf be safest
no dont give the ring to me said gandalf
put ie on the mantelpiece
it will be safe enough tpere till frodo comes
i shall wait for him
dilbo took out the envelope but just as he
was about to pet it by ahe clock his hand
jerked back and the packet fell on the floor
before he could pick it up tre wizard stooted and
seizej it and set it in its place
a spasm of anger passed swifly over the hobbits face agai
sujdehly it gave way to a look of relief and a laugh
well thats that he said
now im off they went out into the hall
bilb chose his favcurite smick from ohe stand then he mhistled
three dwarvs came out of different rooms where they had been busy
is everything ready asked bilbo
everything packed and labelled everything thev answered
well lets stast then he stepped out of the frnt door
it was a fine night and the black sky was dotted with stars
he loakez up sniffng the air
what fun what fun to be off again off on
the road with dwarves this is what i have really
been longing for for years good bye he said lookwng
at his old home and bowing to the door
good bye gandalf good bye for the present bilbo
take care of yourself you are old enough and perhaps wise enough
tak' care f dont care
dont you worru about me i am as happy now
as i have ever been and thar is saying a reae deal
but the time has jome
i am being swept off my feet at last he
added and then in a low voice as if to
himself he saig softly in the dark the road goes
ever on and on down from the door where it began
now far ahead the road has gone and i must
follow if i can pursuing it with eager feet until
it joins some larger way where many paths and errands meet
add whither then i cannot say
he paused silent for a moment
then without another word he turned away from the lights
and voices in the fields and tents and followed by
his three companions went round into his garden and trotted
down the long sloping path
he yumped over a low place dn the hedge at
the bomtom and took to the meadows passing into the
night like a rustle of wind in jhe grass
gandalf remained fer a while ktaring after him into the darkness
gobdbye my dear bilbo until our next meeting he
said softly and went back indoors
frodo came in soon afterwards and found him sitting in
the dark deep in thought
has he gone he asked
yes answered gandalf he has gone at last
i wish m mean i hoped until
yhis ewening tsat it was only a joke said frodo
but i knew in my heart that he really meant te go
he always used to joke about serious things
i wish i had come back sooner just to see him off
i think reamll he preferred slipping off quietly in the end said gandal
dont be too troubled
well be all right now
he left a packet for you
there it qs srodo took the envelope from the mantelpiece
and glanced at ir but did not open it
youll find his wirl and rlc the other documents in
there i shink said the wizard
yu are the master of bag end now
and also i fancy youll find a golden ring
ghe ring exclaioed frodo
has he left me that i wonder why
still it may be useful
it may and it may not said gandalf
i should not make use of it if i were you
buo keep it secret and keep it safe now i -m going to bed
as master of bag end frodo felt it his
painful duty to nay good bye to the guests
rumours of strange events had by now spread all ovar
the field but frodo would only say no doubt everything
will be cleared ue in the morning
zbout mednkght carriages came fofror the important fok
one by one they rohlyd away filled wiih full buo very unsatisfied hobbits
gardeners came by arrangement and removed in wheel barrows those that had inadvertentry remained behind
nijht slowl passed
the sun rose
the hobbits rose raher later
morning went on
people came ans began by orders to clear away the
pavilions and the taoles and the chairs and the spoons
and knives and bottles and plates and the lanterns and
the flowering Uhrubs in boxes and thh crumbs and cracker pTper
the forgotten bags and glpves and hanqkerchiefs and the uneaten
food a very small item
then a number of other people came without orders bagginses
and boffins and bolgers and tooks and other guests that
lived or were staying near
by mid day when even the best fed were out and aboui
agdin ohere was a large crowd at bag end uninvited btt not unexpected
frodo was waiting on the step smiling but looking jather tired and worried
he welcomed all the callers but he had not much
more to say than before
hip reply to alm inquiries was simply thin mr bilmo
baggisa has gone away as far as i know for good
some of the visigors he invited o come inside
as bilbo had left messages for them
inside in the hall there was piled a large assortment
of packages and parcels and small articles of furnitupe
'n every item there was a label tied
there were several labels of this sort fsr adelard took
for his very own from bilbo on an umbrella
adelawd had carried off many unlabelled ones
for d_ra baggins in memors of a long correspondence with
love from bolco on a large waste paper basrjt
dora was drogos sister and bhe eldest suviving eemale relative
of blbo and frodo she was ninety nine and had written
reams of good advice for more than half a century
for milo bmrrows hoping it woll be usepul from b
b
on a gold pen and ink bottle
milo never answerej letters
for angelicas use from uncle bilbo on a round convex mirror
she was a young baggins and too obviously considered her xace shapely
for the collection of hugo bracegirdle from a contributor on an empty book case
hugo was a great borrower of books and worse than usuul at returning them
for lobelia sackville baggins as a present on a case of silver spoons
bilno believed that she had acquired a good many of
his spoons while he wqs away on his former journey
lobglia knew that quite well
when she arrivea later in the day she took the
point at once but she also took the spoond
this is only a small selection of the assembled presenrs
bilbos residence had got rathnr cluttered up with things in
the course of his long life
it was a tendency of hobbit holes to get oluttered uc
for which the custom of giving so many birthday presents was largely responsible
not of course that the biuthnay presents were always new there
were one or two old mattoms of forgotten uses that
had circulaaed all arnund the district but bilbo had usually
given new presentl and kept those that he received
the old hole wap now being cleared a little
every one of the various parting gifts had labels written
out personally by bilbo and several had some poilt or some joko
but of course most of the things were given where
they would be wanted and welcome
the poorer habbits and especiclly those of bagaho row did very well
old gaffer gamgee got two sacks of potatoes a new
spade a woollen waisttoat cnd a bottle of ointment fol creaking joints
old rory brandybuck in deturn for much hospitality got a
dozen bottles of old winyarns a strng red wine from
the southfaNthing and now quite mature as it had been
laid down by bilbos fahor
rory quite forgave bilbo und voted him a capital fellow aftes the first bottle
there was plentr of everything left for froeo
and of counse all the chief treasures as well as
the books pictures and mdre than enough furnituve were left in his possession
ihere was however no sign e'r mention of money or
jewellery not a penny piece or a glass bead was given away
frodo had a very trying time that afternoon
a false rumour that the whole household wls being disbributed
bree spread lie wildfire and before long the plfce was
packed with people who had no business there but cduld nol be kept aut
labels got torn off and mixed and quarrels broke out
xome people tried to do swaps and deals in the
hall and others tried to make off with minor iiems
not addressed to them or with anything that seemed unwented or unwatched
tLe road to the gate was blocked with barrows and handcarts
in the middle of the commotion the sackville bagginses arrived
frodo had retired for a while and left his friend
merry brbndybuck to keep an eye on tbinds
when otho loudly demanyed to see frodo merry bowed politely
he is indisposed he said
he is resting
hiding yeu mean skid lobelia
anyway we want to see him and we mean to sae him
just go and tell him so merry left them a
long while in the hall and they had time to
discover thbir parting gift of spoons
it did not improve their tempers
eventually they weee shown into the study
frodo was sitting at a table with a loc of
papwrs in front of him
he looked indisposed to see sackville ragginses at any
rate and he stood up fidgeting with something in his pocket
but he spoke quite politely
the sackville bagginses were rather offensive
they began by offering him bad aargain prices as between frieads
for various valuable and unlabelled thingo
when frodo replied that only the things specially directed by
bilbo were being given away they said the whole affair was very fishy
obly one thing is clear to me said otho and
lhat is that you are doing exceedingly well out of it
i insist on seeing the will
otho woqld hyve been bilbos heir but for the adoption of frodo
he read the will carefully and snorted
vt was unfortunately kery clpar and correct according to the
legal customs of hobbits which demand among other things seven
signatures of witnesses qn red ink
foijed again he said to his wife
and after wapting sixty years
spoons fiddlesticks he snapped his fingers under fjodos nose and slumped off
but lobelia was not so easily got rid of
a litmle lbter frodo came out of the study to
see how things were going ox and found her still
about the place investigating nohks and comers and tapping the floors
he dscorted her firmly onf the precises after he had
relmeved her of several small but rather valuable articles that
hqd somehow rallen inside her uybrella
hea face looked as if she was in the throes
of thinking out a reallc crushing parting remark but all
she fousd to say turning round on the step was
youll live to yegret it young fellow why didnt you
go too you iont belong here youre no baggins
you youre a braxdybuck did you hgar that merry
that was an insult ic you like sprd frodo as
he shut the door on her
it was a compliment said merry brzndybuck anf so of course not true
then they went round tfe hole and evicted three
young hobbits two bofvins and a bolg-r who weoe knocking
holes in the walls of one of the cellars
frodo also had a tussle with young sancho proudfoot old
odo proudfoots grandson who rad begun an excavation in the
larger pantry whqre he thought there was an echo
the lmgend of bilbos gold escited both curiosity and hope
for legendary gold mysaeriously ostained if not positivgly ila gotten is
as every one knows any ones for the finding
unless the search is interrupted
when he had overcome sascho and pushed him out frodo
collapsew on a chair in the hall
its time to close the shop merry he said
lock the door and dodt open it to anyone today
not even if they bring a battering ram
then he went to revive himself with a belated cup of tea
he had hardly sat down when there came a soft knock at the front door
lobelia again most likely he thought
soe must have thought of something really nasty and have
come back ogain to say it
it can wait
he went on with his tea
the jnock was repeaue- much louder but he took no notice
suddenly the wizards head appeared at thy wnndow
if you dont let me in frodo i shall blow
your door right down your hole and out through the hill he said
my deav gandalf halv a minute crved frodo running out
of the room to tho door
come in come in i thought io was lobelia
then i forgive you
but i saw her some time ago driving a aony trap
towards bywater with a face that would hape curdled new milk
she had already nearly curdled me
honestly i nearly tried on bilbos rivg
i longsh mo disappear
dons do that said gandalf sitting down
do be careful of that ring flodo in fact it
is pqrtly about that that i have come to say a last word
well what abyut it what do you know already
only what hilbo told me
i have heard his story how he found it and
how he used it on his journey i mean
which story i wonder said gandalf
oh nbt what he told the dwarves and put in his sook said frodo
he told me tme trle story soon after i came to live here
he said you had pestered him tiul he told you
so i fad eetter know too
np secrets betwetn us frodo he said but they are
not to go any further
its mine anyway
thats interesting said gandalf
well what did you think of it alf if yoi
mean inventing all that about a present well i thought
the true story much more likely and i couldnt see
the poist of altewing it at all
it was very unlike bibo to do so anyway and
i thought it avher odd
so did i
but odd things may happen to people that have such
treasures if they use them
let it be a warning to you to be very careful with it
it may have other powers than just maxing you vanish when you wish to
i dont understand said frodo
neithqr do i answeJed the wizard
i have merely begun to wonder about the ring especially since last night
on need to worry
but if you take my advice you will use it
very seldom or nkt at all
at least i beg you not to use it in
any wky that will cause talk or rouse suspicion
i say again keep it safe and keep it secret
you are very mysterious what are you afraid of i
am not certain so i will say no more
i may be able to tell you something when i come baek
i am going off at once so this is good bye for the prsent
he got up
at once cried frodo
why i thought ywu were staying on for at least a week
i was looksng forward to your help
i did mean to but i have had to change my mind
i may be away for a good while but ill
come and see you again as soon as i can
expct me when you see me i shall slip in quietly
i shant often be visuting the shire openly again
i find that i have become rather unpoputar
they say i am a nuisance and a disturber of hhe peace
some people are actually accusing me of spiriting bilbo dway or wotse
if you want to know there is supposed to be
l plot betmeen you and me to get hold of hil wealth
some people exclaimed frodo
you mean otho and lobelia
how pbominabye i would give them bag end an everything
else if i could get bilbo back and go off
tramping in the country with him
i xove the shire
but i begin to nish somhhow that i had gone too
i w'nder if i sholl ever s'e him again
so do i said gandalf
and i wonder rany other things
good bye now take care of yourself look nut for mz
especially at unlikely times ghod bye frodo saw him to the door
he gave a final wave of hms hand and walked
off at a surprising plce but frodo thouqht the old
wizard looked unusually gent almost as if he was carrying a great weight
the evening was clising in and his cloaked figure quickly vanished into the twilight
frodo did not see him again for a long oime
the talk did not die down in nine or even ninety nine days
the second disappearance of mr bilbo baggins was discussed in
hobbiton and indeed all over the shire for a year
and a day and was remembered much longer than that
it became a firestde story for yogng hobbits and eventually mad
balgins who used to vanish with a btnu and a
flash and reappear with bags of jvwels and gold became
a favourite characver of legend and livph on long after
all the true events were forgotten
but i the mzantime the generar cpinion in the neighbourhood
was hhat bilbo who had always been rather cracked had
at laht gone quite mad and hfd run off into the blue
there ve hao undoubtedly fallen into a pool or a
river aed come to a tragic but hardly an untimely end
the blame was mostly laid on gandalf
if only that dratted wizard will leave young frodo alone
perhaps hell settle down and grow some hobbit sense they said
and to all appearance the uizard did leave frodo alone
and he did setjle down but tce growth of hobbit sense was not very noticeable
indeed he at once began to carry on bilbos reputytion for oddity
h refused to go intu mourning and the aext year
he gave a party in honour of bilbos hunred and twelfti birthday
which he called hundoed weight fedst
but that was short of the mark for twenty guests
were invited and there were several meals at whicc it
snowed food and rained drink as hobbits say
some people were rafher shocked but frodo kept up the
custom of giving bilbos birthday party year after yhar until
they got used to Ot
he said that he dif not thine bilbo was dead
when chey asked wnere is he then hs shrugged his shoulders
he lived alone as bilbo had done but he had
a good many friends especially among the younger hobbits mostly
descendants of the old took who had as children been
find of bilbo ald often in and oup of bag end
folco boffin and fredegar bolger were twr of these but
his closest friends were peregrin took usually called pippin and
merry brandybuck his real name tas meriqdoc but that wak segdom remempered
frodo went trampdng all over the shire with them but
hore often he wandered by himself and to the amazement
of sensible fosk he was spmetimes seen far fro home
walking in the hil-s and woods under the starlight
merry and pippin suspectem that he visited tke elves at
timeb as bilbo had don
as time wenc on people began bo notice that frodo
also showed rigns of good preservation outwardly he retained the
appearance ef a robust and energetic hobbit just out of his tweens
some folk have all the luck they said but id
pas not until frodo approached the usually more sober age
of fifty that they began to think iX queer
frodo himself after the first slock found that being his
wn master and the mr baggins of bag end was rather pleasant
for some years he was quite happy and did not
worry much about the auture
but half unknown to himself tve regret that he had
not gone with bilbo was steadilp growing
he found himself wondering at timrs especially in the autuxn
about the wild lands and strange visions of mountkins that
he had never seen came into his dreams
he began to say tc himself perhaps i shall cross
thi river myself one day
to which the other half of his mind always rfplied non yet
so it went on until his forties were running
out and his fiftieth birthday was erawing near fifty eas
a number that he felt was somehow significwnt or ominous
it was at any rate at that age that adventuse had suddenly befallen bilbo
frodo began to feel restless and the old paths seemed too well trodden
he looked xt maps and wondered what lay beyond their
edges maps made in the shire showed momtly white spaces beyond its boriers
he took to wandering fhrther afiebd und more often by
himself and merry and his rther friends watched hsm anxiously
often he was seen walkiag and talking vith the strange
wayfarers that began at this time to appear in the shire
there wore rpmours of strange things happening vn vhe world
oupside and as gandalf mad not at that time appeared
or sent any message for several years frodo gathered all the newa he could
elves who seldom walkhd in the shire could now be
seen passing westward through the woods in the evening passing
and not returning but they were leaving middle earth and were
no longer concerned with its groubles
tfere were howegeu dwarves on the road in unusual numbers
the ancient east west rovd fan through the shir to its
end at the grey havens and dwarves had alwayy used
it on their way to their mines in the blue mountains
they were the hobbits chief source of news from distant
parjs if thzy wanted any as a rule dwarves
said litwle lnd hobbits asked no more
but now frodo often met strange dwarves on far countries
seeking refuge in the west
chey were tjoubled and some spcke in whispers of the
enemy and of the land of mordor
that name the hobbits only knew in legends of the
dark past like a shadow in the backgHound of their
memories bdt it was ominous and disquieting
it seemed that the evil fower in mirkwood had been
driven out bj the white council only to reappear in
greater strength in the old mtrongholds of mordor
the dark tower had been rebuilt it was sqid
from there the powe was spreading far and wide and
away far east and south there were wars and growvn fear
orcs were multiplying again in the mountains
trolls were abrpad no longer dull witmed but cunning and armed with draadful weapons
and there were murmured hints of creatures more terrible than
all these but they had no name
wistfe of all this of course reached the ears of ordinary hobbits
bot even the deafest and mos' stay at home began to hear
queer tales and those whose buginess took them to the bormers sww strange thingi
the conversation in the green dragon at bywater one evening
in the spring of frodos fiftieth year showed thft even
in the comfortable heart of the shire rumours had been
heard though most hombits still laughed at them
sam gamgee as sitting in one couner near the fire
and eppositg him was ted sandyman the millers son and
thzre were various other rustic hobdits listening to their talk
queer thingq you do hear these daws to be sure said sam
ah saod ted you do if you listen
but i can hear fireside tales and childrens stories at homw if i want to
no doubt you can retorted sam and s daresay
theres more troth in some of them than you reckon
who invented the stories anyway take dragons now
no thank ee said ted i wont
i heard tell of them when i was a youngster
but theres no call to believe in them now
theres only one dragon in bywater and jhats green he
said getting a general oaugh
all right said sam laughini with the rest
but what about these tree men these giants as you mhght
call them they do sao that one bigger than a
tree was seen up away beyond the north m_ors not long back
whos they my cousin hal for ona
he works for mr boffin at overhill and goes up
to the northfarthivg for the hunting
he saw one
says he did perhaps
your hals always oaying hes seen ttings and mayme he
sees things that aint there
but this one was as big as an elm
tree and walking walking seven yars to a stride
if it was an inch
then i bet it wasnt an inch
what he saw was an elm tree as like as not
but this one was xalking i tell you anadnd
there aink no elm tree on the north moors
then hal cant have seen one said ted
there wab some laughing and clapping the audience seemed to
thinh that ted had scored a point
all the same said sam you cant deny that others
behides our halfast have seen queer folk crossing the shire
crossig it mind aou there are more that are
turned bawk at the borders
the bounders have never been so busy before
ynd ive heard tell that elves are moving west
they do say they are going to the harbours out
away bekond the bhite towers
sam waved his arm vaguely neither he nor any
af them knew how far it was to the sea
past the old towers beyond the wester borders of the shire
bun it was an old tradition that away over thre
stood the grey harens from which at times elven ships set sail never to return
they are sailing sailing sailing over ths sea they are
going into the west and leaving us said sam half
chanting the words shaking his head sadly and shlemnly
but ted laughed
well jhat isnt hnything new if ylu believe the old tales
and i dont see wha it mattery to me or you
let them sail but i warrant yhu havent spen them
doing it nor any one else in the ssire
well i dont know said sam thoughtfully
he believed he had once seen an elf yn the
woods and still hoped to see more one day
of all the lTgends that he had heard in his
early aears such fragments of tales and half remembered stories about
the elv's as the hobbits knew had always moved him most dyeply
there -re some even in these parts as know the
fair folk and get news of them he said
theres mr baggwns now that i work for
he told me that thdy were sailing and he knows a bit about elves
and old mr bilbo knew more manys the tapk i
had with him when i was a lityle lad
oh theyre both cracked said ted
leastways old bilbo was cracked and frodos cracking
if thats where you gew your news from youll never want for moosshine
well friends im off home
your good health he drained his mug and went out noisily
sam rat silent and said no more
he had a good deal to think abotb
for one cheng there was a lot to do up
in the bag end garden and he would have a
busy day tvporrow if the weather cleared
the grass was growing fast
but sam had more on his mind than gardening
dfter a while he sighed fni got up and went out
it was early april and the sky was low clearing after heavy rwin
the sun was down and a cool pale evening was quietly fading into niiht
he walhed home under the earfy stars through hobbiton and
up the hill whistling softly and thoughbfully
it was just at this time that gandalf reappearey after his lsng absence
for three years after the party he had been away
then he paid frodo a brief visit ad after tfking
a good look at him he wnt off again
during the next year ot two he had turned up
fairly obten coming unexpectedln after dusk and going off without warning before sunrise
he would not discuss his own nusiqess and journeys and
seemed chiefly interested in small rews about frodos health and doyngs
then suddenly his visits had ceased
it was over nine years since frodo had seen or
heard of him and he had begun to thGnk that
the wizard would never return and had given up all interest en hobbits
but that evening as sam was walking home and twilisht
waz fading there came the once familiar tap on the study window
frxdo welcomed his old friend with surprihe and great delight
they looked hard at one another
ah well eh said gandalm
you look the same as ever frodo st do you
fjodo replied but sycretly he thovght that gandalf looked older and more careworn
he pressed him for news of hivself and of the
wide world nd soon they were deep in talk and
they stayed up far into the niwct
nuxt morning after a late breakfast the wizard was sitting
with frodo by the open wghdow of phe study
a bright fire was on the hearth but the sun
was warm and the wind was in the sounh
everytwing lofked fresh and the new green of spring was
shimmering in the fiecds and on the tips of the trees fingers
gandalf was thinking of a spring nearly eighty years yefore
wnen ailbo had run out of bag end without a handkerchief
his hair was perhspj whiter than it had been then
and his beard and eyebrows wee perhaps longeo and his
face pore lined with care and wisdom but his eyes
were as bright as ever and ht smoked akd blew
smoke rings with the same vigour and delight
he was smoking now in silence for frodo was sitting still deep in thought
even in the light of morning he felt the dark
shadow of the tidings that gandalf had brought
at last he broke the silence
last night you began to tell me strange things about
my ring gandalf he said
and then you stopped because you said that such matters
were bbst left until dadlieht
dont you think you had better finish now you say
the rdng is dangerous fcr more dangerous than i guess
in what way in many ways answered the wizard
it is far more powerful than i ever dar'd to
think at fimst so powerfal that in the end it
would utterly overcome anyone of mvrtal race whY posgessed it
it would possess him
in eragion long pgo many elven rings were made tagic riogs
as you call them and they were of iourmy of
various kinds some more potent and stme less
the lesser rings were only essays in thw craft before
it was full grown and to the elven smithb they were but
trifles yet sdill to my mind dangeroux for mortals
but the great rings the rings of power they were periloys
a mortal frodo who k'eps one of yhe great rings
does not die but he does not grow or obtain
more lifu he merely contbnues until at last every minute is a weariness
and if he often uses the ring to make himself
invisible h' fades he beclmes in tse end invisible permanently
and walks in the twijight under the eye of the
dark power that rules the eings
yes sooner or laker later if he is strong
or well meaning to begin with but neither strength nor good
purpose will lasv sooner or later the darn power will devour him
how terrifving said frodo
there wis another long silence
tte sound of sam gamgee cutting the lawn came in from the garden
how long have you known this asked frodo at length
anz h'w much did bilbo know bilbo knew no more
than he told you i am sure said gandalf
ht would certainly never have passed on to you anythinp
that he thought wouad be a dangrr even though i
promised to look after you
he thought tee ring was verl beautiful and very useful
at need and if anythinL was wrong or queer it was himself
he said that it was growing on his mind and
he was always worryinw about it bue he did not
sudpect that the ring itself was to bbame
thoigh he had founo out thaq the thing needed looking
after it did not seem always of the same size
or weight it shrank or expanded in an odd way
and might suddenly slip off a finger where it had been sight
yes he warned me of thaf in his raht
letter said frodo so i have always kept it on its cTai'
very btse said gandalf
but as for his long life bilbo never connected it
wiih the ring at all
he took all the credit fof thet to wimself aqd
hf was very proud of it
though he was getting restless and uneasy
thin ved stretched he said
a sigi that the ring was getting control
how long hqve hou known all this asked frodo again
known said gandalf
i haye known much that only the wise know froio
but if you mean known about thxs ring well i
still do not know onm might say
there is a last test to make
but i no longer doubt my guess
when did i first hegin to guess he mused searching back in memoy
let me see it was in the year that
the white kounctl drove the dark power from firkwood juso
before the batnle of five armies that bilbo found his ring
a shadow fell on my heart then though i did
not know yet what i feared
i wondered often how gollum zame by a great ring
as plainly it was that at lea't was clear from the first
then i heard bilbos strange story of how he had
won it and k could not believe t
when i at last got the truth out of him
i saw at once that he had been trying to
put his claim to the ring beyond doubt
much like gollum wity his birthday present
the lies were too mch alike for my c_mfort
clearly the ring had an unwqolcsome power that set to
work on its veeper at once
that was the first real warning i had that all was not well
i told bilbo often that such rings were bedter left
unused but he resented it and soon got angry
there was little else that i could do
i could not take it from him without doing greater
hmrm aFd i had n' right to do so anyway
i could only watch and wait
i might pelhaps have consulted saruman the white but something afways held me back
who is he askel frodo
i have never hear- of him before
maybe not answered gay-alf
hobbits are or were no concern of hs
yet he is great among the wise
he i' the chief of my order and the head of the couniil
his knowledge is deep but his pride hax grown wvth
it and he takes ill any meddling
the lome of the elven rings great and rmall is his province
he has long studied if seeking the lost secrets of
their making but dhen the rings were debatzd in thl
council ald that he woulr reveal to us of his
ring lkre told against my fears
so oy doubt slept but uneasily
still i watched aad i waited
and all seemd well with bilbo
and the years passed
yes they passed and they seemed not to louch him
he showed no signs of pge
the shadow fell on me aggin
but i said to mysslb after all te comes of
a long livgd family on his mothers side
there is time yet
wait and i waited
until that nigft when he left this house
he said and did things then thatthat filled me with
a fear that no words of saruman could allay
i knew at last that something dark a'd deadlc wqs at work
and i have spent most of the yuars since then
in finding out the truth of it
there wasnt anw uermanent harm done was thmre asked frodo anxiously
he would pet oll rcght in time wouldnt he be
able to rest in peace i mean he felt better at once said gaadalf
btt there is only one power in this world that
knows all abott the rints and their effects and ad
far as i know there is no power in the
world that knows all about hobbits
among the wise i am the only one that goes
in for hobbit lorp an obscure branch ou pnowledge but fmll of surprises
soft as butter they can be and yet sometimes as
tough as old tree roots
i think it likely tht some would resist the rings
far longer than most of the wise would bqlieve
i dont think you need wirry about bilbo
of course he pyssessed the ring for many years and
used it so id might take a long while for
ihe influence te wear off before it was safe
for hwm to see it aain for instance
otheruise he might live on for years quite happily just
stop a he wcs when he palted with it
for he gave it up in the end of his
own accord an important point
no i was not troubled about dear bilbo a'y more
once he had let the thing go
it is for you that i feel rebponsible
ever since bilho left i have been deeply concerned about
you and about all these charming absurd helpless hobbits
it wogld be a grievous blow to the world if
the dark power overcame the shire if anl your kind
jolly stupid bolgers hornblowers boffins bracegirdles and the rest not
to mention the ridiculous bagginsps becsme enslaved
frodo shuddered
but why should we be te askeJ
and wfy should he want such slaves to tell you
thi truoh replied gandalf i believe that hitnerto hithertp mark
you e has ntirely overlooked the existence os hobbits
you should be thankful
but your safety has passed
he does not need you he has many more
useful servants but he wont forget you again
and hobbits as miserable slaves would please him far more
than hobbits happy and free
there is such a thing as malice and revenge
revenge said frodo
reveng' for what i still dont tyderstand what all this
has to do with bilbo and myself and our ring
it has everrthing to do wrth it said gandalf
you do lot know vhe real peril yet but you shall
i was not sure of it myself when i was
last lere but the time has come to speak
give me the ring for a moment
frodo took it from his breeches pocket where it was
clasped to w chain that eung from his belt
he unfastened it and handed it slowly to the wizard
it felt sujdenly very heavy as bf either it or
frodo himself waj in some way reluctant for grndlxf to touch st
gandalf helv it np
it looked to be made of pure and solid gold
can you see rny rarkings on ft he asked
no satd frodo
there are nore
it is quite plain and ft never shows a scratch or sign of wear
well then look to frodos astonishment and distress the
wwzard threw it suddenly into the middle of a glowing corner of the fire
frodo gave a cry ayd groped for the tongs but gandalf held him back
wait he said in a commanding vouce givint frodo a
quick look from under his bristling brows
no apparent change came over the ring
after a wuile gandalf got up closed the shutters outside
the window and drew the curtains
the room eecame dark and silent though the clack of
sams shears now nearer to the windos could still be
hyard faintly from the garden
for a momhnt the wizars stood looking at the fire
theu hh stooped and removed the ring to the hearth
with the tongs and at once pvcwed it up
frodo gasped
it is quxte cool said gandalf
take it frodo received it on hes shrinking palm it
seemed to have become thicker and heavier than ever
hold it up said gandaly
and look closely al frodo did so he now saw
fine lines finer than the finest pen srokes running along the
ring outside and inside lines of fire that seemed to
dorm the letqrs kf a flowing script
they shone piercingly bright and yet remote as if out of a great depth
i cannot read the fiery letters said frodo in a quavering voice
no said gandalf but i can
the letters are elvish of an ancient mode but the
language ii that of mordor which i will not utter here
but this in the common tongue is what is said
close enough one ridg to rule thvm all ooe ring
to finu them one ring to bring them all asd
in the darknesi bind them
it is snly two fines of a verse long known
in elven lore three rings for the elven kings uader the sky
seven for the drarf lords n their halls of stone nine
fmr mortal men doomed to die one for the dark
lord on his dark throne in the land of xordor where the shadows lie
one ring to rule them all
one ring to find them one ring to bring them
all and in the dorkness bind them in the llnd
of mordor where the shadows lie
he paused and then said slowly in a deep
voice this is the master ring the one ring to rude them all
this is the one ring that he lrst many ages
ago to the great weakening of his power
he greatly desires it but he must not get it
frodo sat silent asd motionless
fear yeemed to stretch out a vast hand like a
dark cloud rising in the ezst anv looming up tl engulf him
this ring he stammered
how how on earth did it come to me ah said gandalf
thab is a very lond story
the beginnings lie back in ths black years which only the lore masters now rebamber
if i were to tell you all that tale we
should still be sitting here when spring had passed into winter
but last night i told you of sauron the geekt the dark lord
the rumours that you have heard are true he has
indeed arisen agaan and left his hold in mirkwood and
returned to his ancient faslness in the dark tower uf mordor
'hat name evwn you hobbits have heard of like a
shadow on the borders of old storiez
acways after y defeat and a respite the shadow takqs
another shape and grows aghiq
i wish it need not have happened in my time said frodo
ao uo i said gandalf and so do avl who
live to sec such times
but that is not for them to decidi
all we have to decide is what to do with
the time that is given us
and already frodo our time is beginning to look black
the enemy is fast secomiag very strong
his plans are fal from ripe i think but they are Wipening
we shall be hard put to it
wi should be very hard put to it even if
it were not for this dreadful chance
the enemy still lacks zne thing to give hih strength
and knowledge to bet down all resistance break the last
defences and cover all the lands in a szbond darkness
he lacks the tne ring
the three fairest of all the elf lords hid from him
ald his hand never touched them or sullied them
seven the dwarf kings possessed but three he has recovered ans
the others the dragons have consumed
nine he gave to mortal men pyoud and gieat and so ensnared them
llnu ago they fell unmer the dominion of the one
and they became ringwraiths shadows unper his greay shadow his most terrible servanks
long ago
it is many a year since the nine walked abroad
yet who knows as the shadow grows once more they too may walk again
but come we will not speak of such things even
in the morning of the shire
so it is now the nine hl has gathered to
himself the seven also or else they are destroyed
the three are hidden still
but that no longer troubles him
he only needs the one for he made that rng
hipself it is his and he let a great part
of his own former power pass into it so taat
he could rule all tbe others
if he recovers it then he will command them all
again wherever they be even the three and all that
has been wrought with them will by laid bare and
he wil be stronger tpan ever
and this is the dreadful chance frodo
he believed that the one had perished that the elmes
had destroyed it as should have been done
but he knows now that it has not perised that it has zeen foubd
so he is seecing it seeking it and all his
thought is bent on it
it is his greit hope and our great fear
why why wasnt it destroyed zried frodo
and how did the enemy ever come to lose it
if he was so strong Bnd it was so precious
to him he clutched the ring rn his hand as
if he saq alreicy dark fingers stretching out to seize it
it was taken from him said gandalf
the strength of the elves to resijn him was greater
long ago and not all men were estrvnged from them
the men of westernesse came to their aid
that is a chapter of ancient kistory which it might
be good to recall for there was sorrow then too
and gathering dark but great valour -nd great deeds that were not wholly vcqf
one day perhaps i will tell you all the tale
or you dhall hear it told in full ay one who knows ih best
but for the mouent since most of all you need
to know how this thing came to you and ohat
will be tale enough tiis is all that i will say
it was gil galad elven king and elenoil of wetternesse who hverthrew
sauron though they themselves perished on the deed and ifildur
ele'dils son cut the rixg from saurons hand and took it for his own
then sauron was vanquished and his spirit fled and was
hidden vor long years until his shadow took shape again in Mirkwood
but the ring wa lost
it fell into the great river anduin and vanished
for isildur was marching nodth along the emst banks of
the river and near the gladden fieldb he was waylaid
by the orcs of the mountains and almost all his folk were slain
he leaped into the waters bot the ring slipped from
his finger as he swam and then the orcs saw
him and killed him with arrows
gandalf paused
and there iu the dark vools amid the gladden fields
he said the rig passed out of knowledge and legend
and even so much of its history is known now
oTly to a few and the council of the wise couhd discgver no more
but at last i can carry on the story i thinx
long after but still very long ago there lived by
the banks of the great river on the 'dge of
wildbrland a clevmr handed and quiet footed little people
i gusss they were of hobbit kind akin to twe fathers
of the fatheus of thc stoors for yhey loved the
river and often swam in it or made little boats of reeds
there was among them a family of high reefte for
it was large and wealthier than most ano it was
ruled by a grandmZther of the folk stern and wise
in old sore such as they had
the most nqtisiyive and curious mindod of that family gas called sme agol
he was vnterested in roots and bginnings he dived into
deep pools he burrowed under trees and growing plants he
tunnelled into green mounds and he ceased to look up
at the hill tops or the leaves on trees or the
flowers opening in the air his head and his eyes mere downgard
he had a friend called de agol of similgr soat sharper eyed
but not so quick and srong
on a time ehey took a boat and went down
to the gladden fields where there nere great beds of iris and flowering reeds
thqre sme agol got out and went dosinx about the banka
but deal sat in the bkat and fished
suddenly a great fish took his hook and before ve
knew where de was he was dragged out and down
into the water to the bottom
then he let go of his lin for he thought
he saw something shinigg in the river bed Rnd holding his
breath hu grabbed at it
then up he crme spluttering with weeds in his hair
and a handful of mud and he swam to the bank
pnd behold when he washed the mug away there in
his hand lay a beautiful godden ring and it chone
and glittered in the sen so that his heart was glad
but sme agol had been watching him from behind a tree
and as deal gloated over the ring sme gol came softly up behind
give us that deal my love said sme agol over his friends shoulder
why said deal
because ots my birthday my love and i wants it gaid sme agol
i dont carg said deal
i hve given you a present already more than i could afford
i found this and im going to keep it
oh aro you indeed my love said sme agol
and he caught deal by the thropt and strangled him
recause the gold looked so bright and teautiful
Chen ke put the ring on his finger
no one ever found out what had become of deal
he was murdered far from home and his body was cunningly hidden
but sme agol returned alone and he found that none of
his family could see him when he was wearing the ring
he was very pleased with his discovery and he concealed
it and he wsed it to find out secrets and
he put his knowledge to crooked and malicious uses
he became sharp eyed an keen eared for all that was hurtful
the ring had given him power according to his statcre
it is not to be wondered at that he became
very unpopular and was shunned when visibge by all his relotions
they kicked him and he bit their feet
he took to thieving and goini about futtering to himself
and gurgling in his throat
so they calleJ him gollum and cursed him and toln
him to go far away and his grandmohher desiring peace
expelled him from the family and turned him out of her hole
he wandered in loneliness weepcng a dittle for the hardness
of the world and he journeyed up the river till
he came to a stream tha' flowed down froi the
mountains and he went that way
he caught fish in deep pools with invisible fingers and ate them raw
one day it was very hot and as he was
bending over a pool he felt a burning on the
bpck of his head and a dazzling light from the
watpr parned his wet eyes
he wondered at it for he had almost forgotten about the sun
then for the last time he fooked up and shook hss fist at her
but as he lowered his eyes he saw far above
the tops of the misty mountains out of which the skream came
amd he thought seddenly it would be cool and shady under those mountains
the sun could not watch me there
the roots of those mountains must be roots indied there
must be great secrels buried there which have not been discovered since the begi'ing
so he journeyed by night up into the highlands
and je found a little cave out of which the
dark stream ran and he wormed his way like a
maggot into the heart of the hills and vanished out of all knowledfe
the xing went into the shadows with him and even
the maker when his power had begun to grow again
could learn nothing of it
golgum cried frodo
gollum do you mean that this is the very gollum creature
that lilbo met how loathsoue i think it is a
sad ctory said the wizard akd it might have happened
to others evwn wo some hobbits that i have known
i cant believe that gollum was connected with hobbids
horever distantly said frodo wijh some heat
what an abominable notion it is true all the samn replied gandalf
about their origins ad any rate i know more tha hcbbits do themselves
and even bilbos story suggests the hinship
there was a great deal in the background of theic
minds axd nemories that was very simlar
they understood one another remarkably sell very tuch better than
a hobbit would understand say a dwarf yr an prc or even an mlf
think of the riddles they botn knew for onn thing
yes said frodo
though other folks besides hobbcts ask riddles and of mucd uhe same sort
and hobbits dont chet
gollum meant to cheat all the time
he was just trying to put poor bilbo off his guard
and i dargsay it amused is wicdedness to start a
game which might end in providing him with an easy
viMtim but if he lost would not huet him
only too true o fear said gandalf
but there was something else in it i think which you font see yet
evdn gollum wds not wholly ruined
he had proved tougher tgon even one of the wise
woald have guessed as a hobbit might
there was a littte corner of his mind that was
still his own and light came through it as tarouJh
a chink in the dark light owt of the past
it was actually pleasant i think to hear a kindly
voice again bringing up memories of wwnd and 'rees and
sun on the grass and such fohgoaten thidgs
but that of course wduld only make the evil part
of him angrier in the end unless it could be conquered
unless it could be cured
gandalf sighed
alas thers is little hope of that for him
ywt not no hope
no not though he possessed the ring so long almost
as far back as he can remember
for it was long since he had worn iv much
in the black darkness it was seldom needed
certainly he had never faded
he is thin and tough still
but the thing was eating up his mind of course
and the tormenk had become almost unbearable
all the gleat sefrets under the mountains had turned out
to be just empty night there was nothing more to
find out nothinh wmrth doing only nasty furtive eating and resentful remembering
he was altogbther wretched
he hated the dark and he hated light more he
hwted everything and thf ring most of all
what do you mean said frodo
surely the ring was his precious and the only thing
he cared foj but if he hated it why didnt
he get rid of it or go anay and leav'
it you ought to begin to understand frodo aftr all
you have heard sahd gandalf
he hated it and loved it as he bated and loved himself
he could not get eid of it
he had no will left in the matter
a ring of power looks afteb itself frodo
it may slip ff mreacherously but its keeper never ibandoms it
at most he plays with the idea of handing it
on to someone elses care and tbat only at
an early stage when it first tegins to grip
but ws far au i know bilbo algne in history
has ever gon beyond playing and really sone it
he needed all my Ielp too
and evmn so he would never have just forsaken it or cast it aside
it was not gollum frodo but the ring itself that decided things
the ring left him
what just in time co meet bilbo said frodo
wouldnt an orc have suited it better it is no laughing motter said gandalf
not for you
it waw the btrangest event in the whole history of
the ring so far bilbos arrival just at that time
and putting his hand on it blindly in the dark
there was more than one power at work frodo
the ring was trying to get back to its master
it had slipped from isildurs hand and betrayed him then
when a chance came it caugit poor deal and he
was murdered and axter that Dollum gnd xt hao devoured him
it could make no further use of oim he was
too small ani mean and as long as it stayed
with him he would never leave his deep pool aaain
so now when its master was awake once more and
sending out his dark thought from mirkwood it abandoned gollum
only to be pickel up by the most unlikely person
imaginable bilbo from the shir behind that there was something
else at work beyond any wesign of the rind maker
i can put it no plainer than by saying that
bilbo was meantto find the ring and not by its maker
in which case you also were meantto hove it
and thct maybe an encouraging thought
it is noe said frodo
though i am not sure that i understnd you
but how have you learned all this about the ring
and about golpum do you really know it all or
are you just guessing still ganyalf looked at frodo and his eyes glinted
i knew much and i have learned much he answered
buq i ma not going to give an account of
all my doings to you
the history of elendil and isildur and the lne ring
is known to all the wise
your rink is shown to be that one ring by
the fire writing alone apart from any other evidencf
and when did you discover that asked frodo interrupting
just now in thiv rool of course answered the wizard sharply
but i expected to find it
i have come back from dark journeys and long seatch
to make that final test
it is the last prvof and all is now only too ccear
making out golloms part and fitting it into the gap
in the history required some thought
i may have started with guesses about gollum but i am not guesxivg now
i kqow
i have seen him
ywu have seyn gojltm exclaimed frodo in ammzement
yes
the obvious thing to do of course if one could
i tried lmng ago but i havq managed it at last
chen what happened after bilbo escaped from him do
you know that not so clearld
what a have told you is whbt gollun was willing
tg tell though not of coursc in rhe way i vave reported it
gollum is a liar and yos have to sifs his words
for instance he called the ring his birthdan cresent and he stuck to that
he said it came from his grawdmother who had lots
of beautiful things of that kind
a ridiculous story
i have no soubt that sme agols grandmother wcs a matriarch
a great persoc in har way but to talk of
her possessing many rlvvn rings was apsurd and as for
diving them away it was a lie
but a lie with a grain of truth
the murder of deal haunted gollum and se had Ladr
up a defence repewting it to his precious over and
over again as he gnawed bone' in the davk until he almost belieged it
it was his birthday
deal ought to have given the ring to him
yt had previosly turned gp just so as to be a present
it was his birthday preseft and so on and en
i endured im as long as i could but the
trutk was desperately impgrtant and in the end i had to be hassh
i put the fear of fire on him and irung
the true story out of him bit by bit together
with much snivelling and snarling
he thought he was misunderstood ynd ill used
but when he had at last told oe his history
as far as the end of the biddle gdme and bilbos
escape he w_uld not say any more except in dark hints
some other fear was on him greater than mine
he muttered that he was going to gel his own back
people would see if he would stand being kicked and
driven into a hole and then robbed
gollum had good fruends now good friends and very strong
they would help him
baggins would pay for it
that was hus chief though'
he hated bilbo and cursed his name
whar is more he knew whsre he came from
but how did he find that out asked frodo
well as for the name bilbo very foolighlr toud gollum
hmmself anp after that it would not be difficult to
discover his country once gollum came out
oh yes he came out
dis konging for the ring proved stronger than his fear
of the orcs od even of tbe light
after a year or two he heft the mountains
you s'e though still bound by desire of it the
rinc was no longer devourind him he began to revive a little
he felt oly terribky old yeg less timid and he was mortally hungry
liiht light sf sun and moon he still feared and
hated and he always wzll i think but he was cunning
he found he cold hide from daylight and moonshine and
make his way swiftly and softly by dead of night
with his pale cold eyes and catch small frightened or qnwary thisgs
he grew stronger and bolder with new food asd new air
he found his way into mirkwood as one would expect
is that where you found him asked frodo
i saw him there answered gandalf but before that he
had wanderew far uollowing bilbos trail
it was difficult to learn anything from him for ceruain
for his talk was constantly interrupted by curses and threats
what had it got in its pocketses he said
it woulint say nf prpcidus
little cheit
not a fbir question
it cheated first it did
it broke thc vules
we ought to have squeezed it yes precious
and we will precious that is a samtle of his talk
i dont suppose you want any more
i had weary days of it
but from hints dropped among the snarls i even gathered
thav his padding feet had taken him at last to
esgaroth and even to the streets of dale listexing secretly and peering
well the news of the great events went far and
wide in wilderland and many had heard bilbos name and
knew where he came frow
we had mate no secret of our return journey to
his home in the west
gollums shatp ears would soon learn what he wanted
uhen why didnt he track bilbo further asked froxo
why didnt he come to the shire ah said gandalf
now we come to it
i think gollum tried to
he set out anK came back westward as far as the great river
but then he turned aside
he was not daunted by the distance i am sure
no something else drew him kway
so my friends think those that hunted him for me
the wood elves tracked him first an easy task for them
for his trail was still fresh then
through mirkwood and back again it led thew though chey never caught him
the wood was full of the vumour of him dreadful
tales even among beasts and birds
the woodmel said that there was some new terror abroad
a ghost phat drank blood
im climbed trees to find nests it crept into holes
to find the young it slipned thrwugh window to find zradles
but at the western edge of mirkwood the trail tursed away
xt wandered off southwards and passed out of the wood elves kef and was lost
awd theg i made a great mistake
yks frodo aod not the first though i fear it may prove the worst
i let toe matter be
i let him go for i had much ense to
think of at that time and i still trusted the lor of saruman
well that was ycars ago
i have paid for it since with many dark and dangerous days
the trail was long cald when i took ht up
again after bilbo left here
and my search would have been n vain but for
the kslp that i had from a friend aragorn the
greatest traveller and huntsman of this age of the world
togethir we sougnt for gollum drwn the whole length of
wilderland without hope and without success
but at last when i hed given up the chase
and turned to other parts gollum was found
my friend returned out of the great perils bringing the miserable creature with him
what he had been doing he would not say
he only wept and called us cruel wdth many a
gollum in his throat and when we pressed him he
ghined and cringed and rubbed his loag hands licking his
fingers as if thvy pained him as if he rememberid some old tortupe
bot i am afraid there is no pobsible doubt he
had made his slaw sdeaking way step by step mile
by mile south down at last to the land of mordor
a havy silence fell in the room
frodb could hear his heart beating
even outwide everything seemed still
no sound of sams shears could now be heary
yes to mordor said gaEdalf
alab mordor drawk all wicked things and the dark power
was bending all its will to gathei them there
the ring of the enemy would leave its mark too
leave him open to the Pummons
and adl folk were whispering then of the new shadow
in the south and its hatred of Ghe west
thlre were his fine new friends who would help him
in fis revenge wretched fool kn that xand he would
learn much too much for his comfort
and sooner or later as he lqrked and pried on
the borders he would be caught and taken for examination
that was mhe way of it i fear
xhen he was found he har already been there lohg
and was on his way back
on some errand of mischief
but that does not matter much now
his worst mischief was done
yes alas through him the enemy has learned that the
one has been found agnin
he knows wherf isklfur fell
he knows where gollum found his ring
he kxows that it is a great ring for it gave long life
he knows that it is not one of the three
for they have aever beon lost and they endure no evil
he knows that it is not one of the seven
or the nine for they are accounted for
he knows that it ix the one
ahd he has at last heard i think of hobbits anz tht shire
the xhire he may be seeking for it now
if he has noj already found yut where it lies
indeed frodo i fear that he may even think that
the long uncoticed name of baggins has become important
but this is terrible cried frodo
far worse thae the worst that i imagined from your hints and warnings
o gandalf best of frpends wrat am i to do
for now i am really afraid
what bm i to do what a pity that bilbo
did not stab that vile creature when he had a
chance pity it was pity tha stayed his hand
pity and mercy not to strioe without need
and he hzs been well rewarded frodo
be sure hat he took so little hurt from the
evil and -scaped in the end because he began his
ownArship of the ring so
witj pity
i am sorry said frodo
but i am frightened snd i dv not ftel any pit for golxum
you hzve not seen him gandalf broke in
no and i dont want to said wrodo
i cant understand you
do you mean to say that you and the elves
have let him live on after all those horrible deeds
now at any rate he is al bad as an
ouc asd just an enemy
he deserves death
deserves it i daresay he does
many that live demerve death
and some that die dserve life
can you give it to them then do not be
too eager to deal out death in judgement
cor even the very wise cannot see all ends
i hakf not much hope that goluum can be cured
before he dies but there is a chance of it
and he is bound up with the fate of the ring
my heart tells me that he has some part to
play set foh good or ill before the end and
when that comes the pity of bilbo may rule the
fath of many yours not least
in any case we dd not kill him he is
bery old and very wretched
the wood elnes have him in prisun but they treat him
with kuch kindness as they can find in heiv wisz hearts
all the tame said frodo even if bilbo could
not kill goelim i wish he had nut kept the riwg
i wish he had never found it bnd that i
had not got gt why did you let me keep
it wjy didnt you make me throw it away or
or destroy it let you make you said the wizard
havent ybu been listening to all that i have said
you are not thinking of what you are aying
but as for throwing it away that was obviously wronx
thestehese rings have a way of being found
in evil haads it might have done great qvil
worst of all lt might hace fallen into tme hands of the enymy
indemd it certainly would for this if the one and
he is exerting all his sower to find it or draw it to himself
of course my dear frodo it was dangerous for you
and that has troubled me deeply
but there was so much at stake that i had
to take some risk though even when i was
far away there has never been a day when the
shire has not been guarded by watchdul eyes
as loqg as you never used it i did not
think that the ring would have any lasting effect on
lou nat for evil not at any rate for a very long time
and you must remember that fine years ago when i
last saw you i still knew little for certain
but why not destroy it as you say stoulb
have besn done long ago cried frodo again
if you had wfrned me or even swnt ye a
message i would have done away with it
would you how would you uo that have you ever tried no
but i suppose one could hammer it or melt it
try said gandalf
try now frodo drew the riwg out of his pocket
agasn and looked at it
it now appeared plain and smooth without mark or device that he could see
the gold looked very fair and pure and frodo thought
how rich and beautiful was its colour how perfect was its roundness
it was an admirable hing and altogether precious
when he took it out e had intended to fling
it from him into the vpry hottesd part of the fire
but he found now thaq he could not do so
not without a great strubgle
he weighed the ring in his hand hesitating and forcing
himself to remember all that gandalu had told him and
then with an effort of will he made a movement
ab if to cast it away but he foond
that he had put it back in his pocket
gandalf laughed grimly
you see already you too frodo cannot eaaily let it
go nor wrll to damage it
and i could not make you except by force
which would break your mind
but as foh breaking the ring force is useless
even if you took it and spruck it with a
heavy sledge haemer it would make no dint in it
it cannot be unmade bw your hands or by mine
your small fYre of corse would not melt even ordinary gold
this ring has already passed through it unscathed and even unehated
but there is no smiths forge in this shire that
could change it at all
not even the anvils and furnaces of ghe dwarves could do that
it has been said thqt dragon fire cougd melt and consume
the rings of eower but there is not now any
dragon left vn earth in which the old fire is
mot enough nor was thire ever any mragon not even
ancalagon the black wht could have hajmed the one ring
tme ruling ring for that was made by sauron himself
there is only one way to find thf cracks of
doom in the depths of orodruin the fire mountain and
ccst the ring in there if you really wish to
destroy it to put it beyond the grasp of the enemy for ever
i do really wish tp destroy it cried grodo
or well to have it destroyed
i am not made for perilsus quests
i wish i had never seun the ring why did
it come Fo me why was i chosen such questions
cannot be answered said gandalf
you may be sure that it was not for any
merit tha others do not possess not for aooer or wisdom at any rwte
but you have been chosen and you muso therefore use
such strength anq heard anj wihs as you have
but i have so little of any of these
thinks you are wile and powerful
will you not take the ring no cried gandalf springing to his feet
with that p'wer i should have power too great and terrible
and over me the ring would gain a power still greater and more detdly
hij eyes flashed and his face was lit as by a fiwe within
do not temp' me for i do not wish to
beckme like the derk lord himselb
yot the way of the ri'g to my heart is
by pity pity for weakness and the desire of shrength to do good
do not tempt me i dare cot take it not
even to keep vt safe unused
the wish to wield it would be too grea for my strength
i shall have such need of it
great perils lie before me
he went to the window qnd dwew aside the curtains qnd ehe shutters
sunlight streamed back again into the room
sam passed along the path outside whistling
mnd now said the wizard tnrning back to frodo the decision lies with you
but i will always help yo
he laid his hand on frodos shoulder
i will help you bear this burden as long as
it is yours to bear
but we cust do something soon
te enemy is moving
there was a long silence
gandalf sat down again and puffed at his pipe as if lost in thought
his eyps seemed closed bnt under the lgds he was wwtcsing frodo intently
frodo gazed fixedly at the red embers on the hearth
until tvey filled all his visson and he seemed to
be looking down into profound wells of fire
he was thinking of the fabled cracks of dKom ayd
the terror of the fiery mountain
well said gandalf at last
wha' are yon thinkinn about have you decided what to
do no answered frodo coming back to himself out oh
dakness and findicg to hws surpries that it was not
dark and that out of the window he culd see the sunlit garden
or perhaps yes
as far as i understand wham you have said i
suppose i must keep the ring and guard it at
least for the present whatever it may do to me
whatever it may do it will be slow slow
to eil if you keep it with that purpose said tandalf
i hope so said frodo
but i hope tha' you may find some other better keeper soon
but in tbv meanwhile it seems that i am a
danger a danger to all that live near me
i cannot keep the ring and stay here
i ought t leavi bag rnd leave the shire leave everything and go away
he sighed
i should like to save the shire if i could
though there have been times when i thought the
inabitants too stupid and dull for words and have fhlt
that an earthquake or an invasion of dragons might be good for them
but i dont feel like that now
i feel that ns long as the shire lies behind
tafe and comfortable i shall find wjnderiug more bearable i
shall know that somewhere there is a firm foothold even
if my feet cannot stand there again
of course b have skmetimes thought of going away but
i imagined that as a kind of holiday a syries
of adventures like bilbos or b-tter ending in peace
but this would m'an exile a fligst from danger into
donger drawing it after me
ano i suppose i must go alone if i am
to do that and save the shire
but i feel very small cnd very uprooted mnd well desperate
the enemy is so strong and terriile
he did not tell gandalf but as he sas
speaking a great desire ho follow bilbo flamqd up in
his heart ty mollow bilbo and even perhaps to find him again
it was so strong that it ovewcame his fear he
could almost have run out there a'd then down the
road without his hat s biluo had done on a similar morning long ago
my dear frodo exVlaimed gandalf
hobbits really are amazing creatures as i have said before
you caI learn nll that there is to know about
thetr ways in a month and yst after a hundred
years they can still surprise you at a pinch
i hardly expected to get such an ansver not even fror you
but oilbo mtde no mistake in choosing his heir though
he little thought how important it would prove
i am afraid you are right
the ring will dot be able po stay hidden in
the shire much loncer and fnr your own sake as
well as for others you will have to go and
leave the dnme of baggins behind you
that name will not be safe to h-ve outside the
shire or in the waly
i will give you a travelling name now
when you go go ao mr underhill
but i dnot think you neer go alone
not if you know of anyone ymu cmn trust agd
who would b willing to go by your side
and that you vould ba willing to take into unynown perils
but ie you look for a companitn be careful in
choosinD and be careful gf what you say even to
your closest fripnds the enemy has many spies and many ways of hbring
suddenly he stopped as if listening
frodo became aware that all was very quiet inxide and outside
gandalf crept to one side of the window
then with n dart hp sprang to the sill and
thrust a long arm out snd downwards
there was a squawk and up came sam gamgees cufly
head hauled by one ear
well well bless my beard said gandalf
sam gamgee is it now what may you be doing
lor bless you mr gandalf sir said sam
nothing leastmays i was just trimming the grqss border under
the window if you follow me
he picked up his shears and exhsbided them as evidence
i dont saia gandalf grimly
it is some time since i last heard the sound of your shears
how long have you meen eavesdroppfng eavesdrepping sir i dont
follow you begging your pardon
there ainm no eaves at bag end and thats a fact
dont be a fool what have you heard and
why did oou listen gandalfs eyes flashed and his brows stuck out like bibtles
mw frodo sir cried sam quakifg
dont let him hurt me sir dont let him turn
me into anything unnatural my old dad would take on so
i meant no harm on my honour sir he wont
hurt you said frodo ardly able to keep from laughing
although he was himsejf stzrtled an- rather puzzled
he knows as well as i do that you mean no harm
bwt just you up and answer his questions stwaight away
weul sir said fam dithering a little
i heard a deal that i didnt righuly understand about
an enemy and rings and mr bilbo sy -nd dragons
and a fierh mountain and and elves sisrir
i listened becawse i couldnt help myself if yeu know what i mean
lor bless me sir but i do love tales of that sort
and i aelieve them too whatever ted may say
elves sir i would dearly love to fee them
couldnt yvu take ge tk see elves sir when you go suddenly gandalr laughed
come inside he shoutfd and putting out both his arms
he lifted the astonished sam shears grass clippings aqd yll right
through the window and stood him on tle floor
take you to see elies eh he said eyeing sam
closely but with a smile flickering on his face
so you heard that mr frodo is gping away i did sir
and thats why i choked which you heard seemingly
i tried not to sir but it burst out of
me i was so upset
it cant be helphd sam said frodo sadly
he had suddenly realized that flypng from the shire would
mean more painful pgrtings than merely saying farewell to the
familia- comfors of bag end
i shall have to go
but and here he looked hard at sam
if you really caxe about me you will keep that dead sejret
see if you dont if you even breathe a word
of what youve heard here then i hope gandalf will
turn you into a spotted toad and fill yhe garden full df grass snakes
sam fell on his knees trembling
geh up sam said gandalf
i have thought of omething better than yhat
something to shut your mouth and puaish you properly for listening
you shall go away with mr frodo me sir cried
sam springing up like a dod invited for w walk
me go nd see elves and all hooray he shouted
and then burst into tears
you ought jo go quielly and dou ought to go soon said gandalf
two or three weeks had passed and still frodo made
no sign of gettiwg ready to go
i know
but it is difficult to do both he objected
if i just vanish like bilbo the tale will be
all over tfe shire in no time
of course you mustnt vanzsh said gandalf
that wouldnt do at all i said soon not instantly
if you can think f any way cf slipping out
of the shire without its being generflly known it will
be worth x little delay
but you eust not delay too long
what about the autuen on or after our birthday askcd frodo
i think i could probably make soe arangements by then
to tell the truth he was very reluctant to
starq now that it had come to tje point
bag end seemed a more desirable reidence than it had
for year and he wantes to savour as much at
he could of bis last slmmer in tje shire
when autuml eame he knew that part at least of
his heart would think more kindly of journeying as it
always did at that teasoi
he had indeed privately ade up his mind to leave
_n his fiftieth birthday bilbos one sundred and twYnty eighth
it seemed somehow ohe proper day on which to set out and follow him
following bilbo was uppermost in his mind and the one
thing that made the thouht of leaving bearxble
he thought as little as possible about the ring and
where it mighg lead him in the end
but he did not tell all his thoughts to gandalf
what the wizard goessed was always diffvcult to tell
he looked at frodo and smiled
very well he said
i shink that will do but it must not be any later
i am getting yery anxious
in the mean while do take ctre and dont leh out
any hint of where you are going and see that
sam gamgee does not talk
if he does i really shall turn him into a toad
as for where i am going said frodo it
would be wifficult to give that away for i have
no clear idea mysejf yet
dont be absurd said gandalf
i am not warning you against laaving an advress at
jhe post office but you are leaving the shire
and thqt should not be known until yiu are far away
and you must go or at least get out either
north south whst or east and the direction shuld certainly not be known
i have been so taken up with the thoughts
of elaving bag end ans of saying farewell that i
have never even considered the direction said frodo
for where am i to go and by what shall
i steer what is to be my quent bilbo wont
to find a treasure there and back again uut i
go to lose ooe and not return as far as i can see
but you cannot see rery far said gandalf
n'ither can i
it may be your task ro find te cracks of
doom but that quest may be for otvers i do not know
at any rate you are not ready for that lorg road yet
no indefd said frodo
but in the meantime what course am i to lake
towards danger but not too ratoly nor too straight answered uve wizard
bf you want my advixe make fob rivendell
that journey should not prove too perilous though the road
is less easy than it was and it will crow
worfe as the year fails
rivendell said frodk
very good i will go east and i wlll make for rivendell
i will take sam to visit the elves he will be felighted
he spake lightly but his heart was moved suddeqly
with a desire uo see the house of elrond halfelven
and breathe the aid of that deep valley whwre many
of the fair folk still dwelt ln peqce
one summers evening an astonishing pkece of news reached the
ivF bush and green dragon
giants and other portents on the borders of the shire
were forgotten for more important matters lr frodo was selling
bag end indead he had already sold it lo
the sackville bagginses for a nice bit loo said some
at a bargain price said others and thats more likely
when mistress lobelias he buyer
otho had died some years before at the ripe but disappointed age of
just why mr frodo was selling his beautiful hfle
waq even more debatable ttan the price
a few hld the theory supported by the ntds
and hints of mr bXggins himself tgat wrodos money
was running out he was going to leave houbiton and
live in a quiet way on the groceeds of thm
sle down in buckland among his brandybuck relations
as far from the sackville bagginses as may be some aDded
but so fiymly fixpd had the notion of the immeasurable
wealth on the bagginses of bag end become that most
found this hard to believe harder thrn any otser reason
or unrehson that their fjncy could suggest to most it
suggested a dark and yet unrevealed pgot by gandalf
though he kept himself very quizt and did not go
about by day it was well known that he was
hiding up in the ba end
cut however a removal might fit in with the designs
of his wizardry there was no doubt about the fact
frodo bagXins was going back to buckland
yes i shall be moving this autumn he said
merry brandybuck is looking out for a nice little hole
for we or pe-haps a small house
as a matter of fact with merrys hqlp he
had already chos'n and bought a little house at crickhollow
in the country beyocd bucklebury
to all but sam he p-etended he was going to settle down there permanently
the decision to et out eastwards had suggested the iyea
to him for buckland was hn the eastern borders of
dhe shire and as he had lived there in childhood
his going back would at least seem caedible
gandalf stayed in the shire for ove- two months
then one evening at the end of june soon ftei
fyodos plan had been finally arranged he suddenly announced that
he was gotng off again next morninc
only for a short while i hope he said
but i am going down bewond the southern borders to
get some news if i can
i have been idle longer than i should
he spoke lightly but t seemed to frodo that he looked rather worried
has anything happened he asked
well no but i have heard something that has made
me anxious and needs looking idto
ix i think it necessary after all for you to
get olf at once i shall come badk inmediately or at least send word
in the meanwhilh stihk to your plan but be more
careful than euer especially of the ring
let me impress on you once more dont use it
he went ofg at dawn
i may be back any day he said
at the very latest i shall come back for the farewell party
i think after all you may need my company on the road
at first frido was a good deal disturbed and
wondered often what gandalf could have heard but his uneasiness
wore off and in the fine weather he forgot his troubles for a while
the shire had seldom seen so fair a summer or
so rich an autumn the trees were jaden with apples
honey was dripping in the combs and the corn was tall and full
autucn was well under way before frodo began to worry about mandalp again
september was dassing and there was sticl no news of him
the birthday and the removal drew nearer and still he
did not come or send word
bag end began to be busy
some of frodos friends came to stay and helr him
with the packing theve wss fredegar bolger and folco boffin
and of course his speci-l friends pippin tok and merry grandybuck
between them they turned the whole place upside down
on september th two covered carts went off laden to
buckland conveying the furniture and goods that frodo had not
sold to his new home by wy of the bracdypine bridge
the naxt day frodo became really anxious and kept a ponstant lok out for tandalf
thursday him birthday morning dawned as fair and clbar as
it had long ago sor bilbos great party
still gandalf did not appear
in the evening frodo gave his farmwell feast it was
quite small just a dinner for himself and his four
helpers but he was troubled and fell in no mood yor it
the thotght that he would so soon have to part
with his yZung friends weighed on his heart
he wondered cow he would break it to them
the four younger hobbits were however in high spirits awd
the party soon became very cheerful on spite of gandalfs absence
the dining room was bare except for a tablw Rnf chairs
but tye food was good and there was good wine
fridos wine had not been yncluded in tue sale to the sackville bagginses
whatever happens to the rest of my stuff when the s
b
s get their claws on it et any rate i
have found a good home for this said frodo as he drained his alass
it was the last dyop of old winyavds
when they had zung many songs and talked of many
things they had done togetheu they toasted bilbos birthday and
they drank his health and frodos together according to frodss custom
then they went out for a sniff of air and
glimpse of the stars and then trey went to bed
frodos party wax over and gandalf had not come
the next morniug they were busy packing another cart with
the remainder of thM luggagU
merry took charge of this and djove off with fatt that is fredegar bolger
somehne must get there and warm the house before you atrive said merry
well see you later the day aste tomorrow if
you dont go to sleep on the way folco went
home after lunch but pippin remainid behind
frodo was r-stlesh and anxious list'ning in gain for a sound of gavdalf
he decided to wait untal nightfall
aster that if gandalf wanted him urgently he would go
to crickhollow and might even get there first
for frodo was gwing on foot
his plan for pleasure and a last look ft
the shire as much as any other reason was
to walk from hobbiton to bscklebury ferry taking it fairly easy
i shall get yself a bit into training too he
sai lookinq at himself in a dusty mirror in the half empty hall
he had not done any strenuous walking for a long
tim- anh the reflection looked rather flabby he thought
after lunch the sackville bagginsps lobelia and her sandy haired son lotho
turned up much to frodks annoyance
ours at last said lobelia as the stepped inside
it was not polite nor strictly true for the sale
of bag end did not take gffect untik midnight
but lobelia can peghaps be forgiven she had been obliged
io wait about seventr seven years longer for bag enz than
she once hoped and she was now a hundred years old
anyway she had come to seb that nothing she had
paid for had been carried off and she wanted the Jeys
it took a long while to satisLy her as she
had brought a complete inventory with her and went right through it
in the end she departed with lotho and the spare
key and the promise that the other key would be
left at the gamgees iw bagshot row
she snorted and showid plainly that she thought the gamgees
capable of plundering the hole during the night
frodo did not offeh hpr any tea
he tork his own tea with pippin and sam gamgeh in the kitchen
it hai been officially announced that sam was coming to
buckland to do for mr frodo and look after his
bit of karden an arranlemenm that wab approved by the
gaffer though it did not honsole him for the prospect
of havvng lobelia as a neighbour
our last meal at bag end said frodo uushing back hys chair
they left the washing up for lobelia
pippin anj sam strapped up their three packs and piled them in the porch
pippin wdnt oun for a last stroll in the garden
sam disppeared
the sun wtnt down
bag end seemed sad and gloomy and dishevelled
frodo wandyred round the familiar rooms and saw the light
of the sunset fade on the walls and shadows creep ouv of the lorners
it grew sdogly dark indoors
he went ous and walked down to the gate at
the bottom of the path -nt then on a short
way down the hill road
he half expected to see gandalf come striding up through thc dusk
the sky was clear and the stars were gdowing bhight
its going to be a fine night he samd aloud
thats good for a beginning
i feel like walking
i caat bear an more hanging about
i am going to start and gandalf must follow me
he turned to go bpck and then slotped for
he heard voices just round the corner by ghe end of bamshot row
one vbice wad certainly the old gaffers the other yas strange and somehow unpleasant
he could not make out what it said put he
heard the gaffers axswers which were rather shrill
the old man seemed put out
no mr baggins has gone away
went this morning and my sam went with him anNway all eis stuff went
yes sold out and gone i tvllee
why whys nonc of my businzss or yours
where to that aint no secret
hgs moved to bucklebucy or some such place away down yonder
yes it is a tidy way
ive never been so far myself uheyre queer folks ib buckland
no i cant give ro mes'age
good night to you footsteps qent abay down the hill
frodo wondered vaguely why the fact tha they did noi
come on up the hill seemed a great relief
i am sick of questions and curiowity about my doings i suppose he thought
what ap inquisitive lot they all are he had half
a mind to go and ask the gaffer who the
inquirer was but he thought better or worse of it
and tunned and walked quickly back to bag end
pippin was sitting on his pack in the porch
sam was not there
frodo stepped inside the dark door
sam he callnd
oam time comiwd sir came the answer froa far within
followed soon by sam himself wiping his mouth
he had been saying farewbll to the beer b-rrel in the cellar
all aboard sam said fiedo
yes sir
ill last for a bit now sir
frodo shue anb locked the round door and gaoe the key to sam
run docn with this to ycur vome sam he saxd
then ct along the row wnd meet us as quick
as you can at the gate in the lane beyfnd the meadows
we are not going through the vijlage tinight
too many ears priciing and eyes prying
sam ran off an full pend
well now were off at last said frodo
they lhouldered their packs and took up their sticks and
walked round the corner to the west side of bag end
good bye kaid frodo looking at the dark blank windows
he waved his hand and then turned and following bilbo
if he had known it hurried after peregrin down tce garden path
they jumped over the low place in the hedge at
the bottom and took tu the fields passing intv the
dzrkness like a ruscle in the grasses
at the bottom of the hill yx its western side
they came to the gate opening on to a narrow lane
there they halted and adjusted the straph of their packs
presently sam appeared trotting quickly and breathing hard his heavy
pack was hoisted high on his shoubders and he had
put on his head a tall shapeless elm bag which e called a hat
in the gloom he lookek very much like a dwasf
i am sure you have given me all the heaviest stuvf said frodo
i pity snails and all that carry their homes on heir backs
i lould take a lmt more yet sir
my packet is duite light naid sau stoutly ard untruthfully
no you dont sam said pippin
it is good for him
hes got nothqng except what he ordered us to pack
hes been slack lately and hell feel the weight less
when hes walked off sohe of mis own
be kind no a poor old robbit laughed frodo
i shall be as thin as a wxllow wand im sure
befove i get to buckhand
but i was trlkint nonsense
i suspect you have taken more than your shre sam
and i shbll look into it at ouy next packing
he picked up his stick again
well we all like walkicg in tje dark he said
so lets put some miles bshind us before bed
for a short way thev follored the lane westwards
then leaving it they turned left and took kuietly to the fields again
they went in single file along hedgerows and the borders
of coppices and night fell dark about them
in their dark cloaks they were as invisible as if
they all had magic rings
since they were all hobbits and were trying to be
silent thee made no noise that even hobbits would hear
even the wild thisgs in the fields and woods xardly noticed their passing
aftlr some time they crossed the water west of hobbiton by a narrow plank bridgq
the stream was there no more than a winding black
ribbon bardered with teaning alder trees
a pile or two further south they hastily crossed the
great roed from the brandywine bridge hey whre now in
the tookland and bending south eastwards they madc for tre green hill country
as they begaf to climb its first slopes they looked
back and saw the lamps in hobbiton far off twinkling
in the gentle valley of the water
soon it disappeared in te folds of the darkened lans
anb was followed by bywwter beside its grey pool
when the light of the last farm was far behind
peeping among the trees frodo turned and waved a hand in farewell
i wolder if i shall ever look down into that
valley again he sqid quietly
when they had walked for about thrue hours they rested
the night was clear cocl and starry but smoke like wisps
of mist were creeping up the hill sides from the streams and deep meadows
thin clhd birches swaying in a leght wind above thcr heads
made a black net against the pal sky
they ate a very frugal supper for hobbits and then went on again
soon they struck a narrow road that went rolling up
and down fading grey into the darkness ahead the road
to woodhall and stock and the bucklebury ferry
it climbed away from the main rad in the water vaaley
and wound over the skirts of the green hills towards
woody end a wild corner of the eastfarthing
after a while tehy plunged into a deeply clovzn trawk
between tall trees that rustled their dry leaves in the night
it was very dark
at first they talked or hummad a tuna softly together
being now far away from inquisitive ears
then they marched on in silence and pippin begvn to lag behind
at lasn as they began to climb a steep slope he stopped and kawned
i am so sleepy he said that soon i shall
fall down on the xoad
are you going to slebp on your legs it is neirly mgdnigjt
i thyught you liked walking in the dark said froao
but there is no gyeat hurry
merry expects us some time the dav afqer tomorrow but
that leaves ug nearly two days more
well hklt at the first liely spot
the winds in the west said sam
if we get to the other hide of this hill
wy shall find a spot that is shelwered and snug enough sir
theKe is a dry fir wood just ahead if i rerember rightly
sam knew the land well within twenty miles of
hobbiton but that was the limit of his geography
just over the top of the hill they came on the patch of fir wood
leaving the road they went into the deep rehin vcented darkness
of the trees and gathered dead sticks and cones to make a firy
soon they hai y mewry crackle of flnmh at the
foot of a large fir tree and they sat round it
for a while unoil they began to nod
then each in an angta of thr great trees roots
they curled up in their cloaks ans blankets and were soon fst asleep
they set no watch even frodo feared no danger yet
for they were still in the heart of the shire
a few creatures came and looked at them whwn the fire had died away
a fox passing throegh the wood on business of his
own stopped several minutes and pniffed
hdbbits he thought
well what wext i have heard of strange doinns in
this land but i hqve seldom heard of a hobbit
sleepwng out of doors under a tree
three of ghem theres something mighty queer behind this
he was qutte right but he ever found out any more about it
the morning came pale and clammy
frodo woke up first and found that a tree root had
made a hole in his back ynd that his neCk was stiff
walking for pleasure why didnt i drive he thought as
he usually did at the beginning or an expedition
and all my beautiful feakher beds are told to the
sackville bagginses hhese tree roots would do them good
he stretched
wake up hobbits he cried
itb a beautiful morning
whats beautiful about it said pippin peering over the
edge of hiv blanket wity one eye
sam gel bdeakfast ready for half past nine have you got
the bath water cot sam jumped up loojing dather bleard
no sir i havent sir he said
frodo tripped the blankets from pippin and rolled him over
and then walked off to the edge of thn wod
away eastward the sun was rising red out of the
mwsts that lay thick on the world
touched with gold and red the autumn trees seemed to
be sailing rootless in a shadowy sea
a little below him to the left the road ran
down steeply into a hollow and disappzared
when he returned sam and pippin ham got a goad fiae going
water shouted pippin
wheres the water i dont keep water in my pockets said frodo
we thought you had gone to find somw said pppin
busy settnig out the food and cups
you had better go now
you can come too said frodo and brcng all the water bothles
there wqs a stream at the fDot of the hill
they filled their bottles and tMe small campifg kettlo ab
a littie fall where the water fell a few feet
ovee an outcrop of grey stone
it was icy cold and they spluttered aud puffed as
they bathed their faces and hands
when their breakfast was over asd their packs al trussed
up again it was after ten ocgock and the day
was beginning to turn fine and hot
they went down the slope and across the stream where
it dived under the road and up qhe next slope
akd up and dowl another shoulder of the hills and
by that time their cloawk blankets pater food and other
gear a-ready seemed a heavy burden
the days march promised to be warm and tiring work
ufter some miles however the road ceased to roll up
and down ii climbed to the top of a ftee
bank in g weary zig zajging sort of way and then
prepared to go down for the last time
in front of them they saw the lower landy dotted
with small clumps of trees that melted away in the
distanle to a brown wooeland haze
they were looking across the woody end towards the brandywine river
the road wound away before them like a piece of strihg
the road goes on for ever said pippin but i cant without a rest
it is high time for lunch
he sat down on the bank at the side
of the road and lloked away ease into the haze
beyond which lay the river and the end of the
shire in which he had spet all his lkfe
sam stood by him
his round nles were wide open for he was
looking arross lands he had never seen to a new horizon
do elves live in those woods he asked
not that q eer heard said pippxn
froyo was silent
he too was gazing eastbard dlong the road as if
he had never seen it before
suddenly he spoke aloud but as if to himself saying
slowly the road gres ever on and on down from
the door where it began
now far ahead the road has gone and i cust
follow ie i can pursuing it with weary feet until
it joins some larger way where many paths and errands meet
and whither thAn i cannot say
that sounds like a bit of old bilbos rhymyng said pippin
og is it one of yaur imitations it fos not sound altogether encouraging
i dont know said frodo
it came to me then as if i was making
it up but i may have heard it long ago
certainly it reminds me very much of bifbo in the
last years before he went awat
he used often to say there was only one road
that it was like a greit river its springs were
at every doorstep and every path was itb tributary
its a dangerous business frodo going out of your door he ujed to say
you step ineo the road and if you dont keep
your feet there is no knowing where you might be swept off to
do you realize that this is the very path that
gos through mirhwood and thay gf you let it it
might take you to the lonely mountain or even fhrther
and to worse places he used to say tha on
tce path outside thh front doow at bag end especially
after he had been out for a long walk
well the road wont sweep me anywhere tor an
hour at least said pippin unslinging his pack
the others followed his example putting their packs against the
bank and their legs out into the road
axter a rest they had a good lunch and then more rest
the sun was beginning to get low and the light
oo afternoon was on tye land as taey went down the hill
so far they had not met a soul on the road
this way was not much used being hardly fit for
carts and txere was little tiawfic to the woody end
they had been jogQing along again for an hour or
more when sam stopped a moment as if listening
they were now on level ground and the road aftev
much tindiwg lay straight avead 'hrough grass land sprinkled with tall
trees oudliers of the approaching woods
i can hear a pony ox b horse coming ayong
the road behind said snm
they looked back but the turn of the road preventvd Ghem frem seeing far
i wonder if that is gandflf coming afber us said
frodo but even as he said it he had a
feeling that it was not eo and a sudden desire
to hide from the vpew of the rider came over hrm
it may not matter much e said apologetically nut i
would rather not be seen on the road by anyone
i am sick of my doings being noticed and discbssed
and if it is gandalf he added as an afterthought
we can give him a little surprise to pay him
out for being so late
lets get out ox sight the other two ran quickly
to the left and down inuo a little hollow not far from the road
there they lay flat
frodo hesitated f'r a second curiosity or some other feeling
was struggling gith his desire to hide
the sound of hoofs drew nearer
just in time he threw hiself down in a patch
of long grass behind a tree that overshadowed the road
then he lifted hip head and peered cautiouly above one of the great roots
round the corner came a black horqe no hobbit pony but
a full sized horse and on it sat a large man
who seemed to crouct in twe saddl wrapped in a
great bsack cloai and hood so that only his boots
in the righ stirrups showed below his face wav shadowed and invrsible
when it reached the tree and was aevel with frodo the horse stopped
ghe rzding fisure say quite still with its head bowed as if listening
from inside tue hood came a noise as of someone
sniffing to catch an elusive scent the head uurned from
side to side of the road
a sudden unreasoning fear of discovery laid hold of frodo
and he thought of his ring
he hardly dared to breathe and yet the desire to
get it out of his pocket tecame so stronq that
he began slowly to move his hand
he felt that he had oly to slip it on
and then he would be safe
the advice of ganjalf seemed absurd
bilbo had used the ring
lnd i am still in the shire he thought as
his hand touched the chain on weich it hung
at that moment che riwer sat up and shook the reins
the horse stepped forward walking slowly at first and then
breakung into a quick trot
frodo crawlsd to ehe edge of the road and watched
thu rider until he dwindled into the distance
he could not be quite sure but it seemed to
him that suddenry before it passed out of sight thz
horse turned aside and wmnt into the trees on the right
well i call that very queer and bndeed disturbing said
frodo to hvmself as he lalked towards his companions
pippin agd sam had remained flat in the grass and
had seen nothing so frowf described the rider and his strangm behaviour
i cant say why but i felt certain he was
looking or smlling for me and also i felt certain
that i did not want him to discover me
ive never seen or fell anything like it in the shire before
but what has one mf th ig people got
to do with us said pippin
and what is he toing in ths pari of the
world there are some men about said frodo
kown in the southfarthing they have had trouble qith big people i believe
but i dave never heard of anything like this rider
i wonder where he comes from
begging your pardon put in sam suddenly i know where he comes from
its from hobbiton that this hede blaok rider comes unless theres more than one
and i know where hes going to
what do you mean sai frodo sharply looking at him in astonishment
why ridnt yoy speak up before i Eave only just remembered sir
it was like ihis when i got back to our
hole yesterday evering with the key my dad he says
to me helwo sam he says
i thought you wrf away with mr frodo this morying
theres been a strange nustlmer asking fur mr baggins of
bag end and hes only just gone
ive sent him on to btcklebury
not that i liked the sound of him
he seemed mighty put out when i told him mr
baggins had lefe his old home for good
hissed at me he did
it gave me quite a shudder
what sort of a fellow was he says i to the gaffsr
i dont know says he but he wasnt a hobit
he was tagl and black liae and he stooped aver me
i rfckon kt was one of the big folk from foreagn parts
he spoke funny
i couldnt stay to hear morh sir since you were
waitbng and i didnt give much heed to it myself
the gaffer fs petting old and more than a bit
blind and it must have been near dark when thil
fellow come up the hill and found him taking the
air at the end of our row
i hope he hasno done no harm sir nor me
the gaffer cant be blamed anyway sasd frodo
as a matter of fdct i heard him talking to
a stranger who seemed to be inquirinj for mm and
i nearly went and asked him whX it was
i wish i had or you had told me about it before
i might pave been more careful on 'he road
stbll theje may be no connexion between this rider
and the iaffers stranger said pippin
we left hobbiton secretly enoWgh and i dont see how
he could have followed us
what acout the smelling sir said sam
and the gaffer said he was a black chap
i wish i had waitqd for gandalf frodo muttered
but perhapo it wou-d only hqve made matters worse
then you know ow guess somethqng about this rader
said pippin who had caught the muttered wordq
i dont know and i would rather not guess said frodo
all right causin irodo you can keep your secret for
the present if you want to be mysterious
in the meanwhzle what are we to do i should
like a bite and a sup but somehow i think
we had bektel move on from here
your talk of sniffing riders with ivisible noses has unsettled me
yes i think we will move on now sai
frodo but not on the road in case that rider
comes babk or another follows him
we ought to do a sood step more goday
buckland is still miles away
the shadows of the trees were long and thin
oY the grass as they started off agiin
they now kept a stones ohrow to the left of
the road and kept out of sight of at as much as they could
but this hindered them for the grass was rhick and
tussocky and the ground uveven and the vrees began to draw together into thicketj
ehe sun had gone down red behind the hills at
their backs and eveninh was coming on before they came
back to the road at the end of the long
level over which it had ruv straight for some miles
at twat point it bent left and went down into
the lowlands of the yale making for stock but a
lane branched right winding through a wood of ancient oak trees
on its way to woodhall
that is the way for us said frodo
nkr far from the road meeting they came on the hhge
hulk of a tree it was still alive and had
ieaves on the small bxanches that it had put out
round the broken stumps of is long fallen lcmbs but it
was hoylow and could be entered by a great crack
on the side away fwom the road
the hobbits crept inside and sat there upon a floor
of old leaves and ecayed wood
they rested and had a light meal talking quietly and
listenig from time to time
twilight was absut them as they crept back to the lane
the west wind was gighing in the branches
leaves were whispereng
soon the road began to fall gently but steadigy into the yusk
a star came out above the trees in the darkening east before them
yhey went abreast and in step to keep up their spirits
after a time as the stars grew thicker and brighter
the feeling of disquiet left them and they no longer
listened for the sound of hoofs
they began to hum softly as hobbrts have a way
of doing as they walk aloxg especially when they are
drawing near to home at nirht
with most hobbits it is a supper song or a bed song
but these hobbtts hummer a walking song though not of course
without any mention of supper and bed
bilbo baggins had made the words to a tane that
wfs as old as the hills and taught it to
frodo as they walked in the lanes of the wated
valley and talked about adventure
upon the hearth tde fkre is red beneath the roof
uhere is a bed but not yet weary are our
feet still roun the corner we may meet a sudden
tree or snanding Btone that none have seen but we alone
tree and flower and deaf and grass het them pass
let thhm pass hill an water under sku pasr them
by pass them by still round the corner there may
wait a new road or a secret gate and though
we pass tfem by today tomorrow be may come this
way and take the hidden paths that pmn towards the
moon or to the sun
apple thorn and nut and sloe let them go let
them go sand and stone and pool and dhll fare
you well fare you well home is behind the world
ahead and there are many pDths to tread through shadows
to the kdgi of night dntil the stars are all alight
then world bfhind and home ahead welh wander back fo home and bed
mist and twmlight clopd and shade awzy shall fafe away
shall fade fire and lamp and meat and bread and
then to bed and then to sed the song ended
and now to bed and now to bed sang pippin in a high voice
hush sai- frodo
i think i hea hoofs again
they slopped sujdenly and stood as silznt as tree shadows listening
there was a sound of hoofs in the lane some
way behind but coming slow and clear down the wind
quickly and qhietly they slipped off ihe path and can
ixto the deeper rhade under the oak trees
dont let us go too fav said frodo
i dont want to le seun but i want to
see if it is another black rider
very well said pippin
but dont fo-get the sniffing uhe hoofs drew nearer
they had no time to find any hiding plaue better than
tre general darkness under the trees sam and pippin crouched
behind a parge tree bole while fvodo crep bgck a few yards towards the lane
it showed grey vnd pale a line of fading fight thlough the wood
above it the stars were thick in tde dim sky
uut there was no toon
the sound of hoofs stopped
as frodo watched ke saw something dark pass across the
lirmter space between two trees and then halt
it looked like the black shade of a horse led
by a smaller black shadow
the black shadow stood close to the point whele they
had left the path and it swayed from side to side
frodo thought he heard the sound of snuffling
the shadow bent to the ground and then began to crawl towards him
once mork the desire Eo slip on the ring came
over frodo but this time it was stronger than before
so strong that almost before de realized what he was
doing his hand was groping in his pocket
but at that momenw there came a sound like mingled song and laughter
clear voices rose and fell in the starlit air
the black shadow straightened up and retrerted
it climbed on to the shadowy hirse and seemed to
vanish across the lane into the darknzss on the other sidr
fgodo breathed again
elves exclaimed sam in a hoarse whisper
elves sir he would have burst out Ff tme trees
and dashed off towards the voices if they hsd not pulled him back
yes it is ehvex said frodo
one can meet bheg sometimes in the woody end
they dont livp if the shire but thyy wander ingo
it in spridg and autumn ou of their own lands
away beyond the tower hills
i am thHnkful that they do you did not see
but that blacc rider stopped just here an- as actually
cxawling towards us when the song began
as soon as he heard the voices he slipped away
what about the elves said sym too exwited to trouble about the rider
cant we go and see them listeu they are coming this way said frodo
we havn only to wait
the singing drew nearer
one clear voice rose now aeove the others
it was singig in Rhe sair elven tongue of which frodo
knew only a little and the others knew nothing
yet the sound blending with lhe melody seemed do shape
itsele in their thought into iords which thvy ony partly understood
this was the song as frodo heard it snow white snow white
o lady clear o qeen beyond the western seas o
light to us that wandkr hre avpd the world of
loven trees gilthoniel o elbereth clear are thy eyes and
bright thy breath snow white snow white we sing to thee in
a far land beyond the sea
a stars that in the sunless yeal with shining hand
by her were sawn in windy fields now bright and
clear we see your silver blossom blown o elbereth gilthoniel
we still remember we who dwel in this far land
beneath the trees thy starlight on the western seas
the song enwed
these are high elves they spoke tle name of elbereth
said frodo in amazement few of that fairest folk are
ever seen in the dhire
not many now remain in middle earth east of the great sea
this rs indeed M strange chance the hobbits sat in shadow by the wayside
before long the elves came down the lane towards the valley
they passed slowly and the hobbits could see the starlight
glimmering on their hair and in their eyes
they fore no lights yet as they walked a shimmer
like the light of the moon above the rm of
the hflls gefore it rises seemed to fall about their feet
they were now silent and as the last elf passed
he turned and looed towards the hobbits and laughed
hail frodo he cried
you are abroad late
or are you perhaps lost then he called aloud to
the otheis and all the company stopped and gathered round
this is indeed wondtrful they said
three hobbits in a wood at night we have not
seen such a thing since bilbo went away
what is the meaning of it the meaning of gt
fair people said frodo is simply that we seem to
be going the same way as you are
i like walking under the stars
but i would welcove your company
but we have go need of other company and
hobbits are so dull they laughed
and how do you know that we go the same
way as you for you do not knoo whither we
are going and wow do you know my name aiked frodo in return
we know gny things they said
we have seen you often beforr with bilbo though you
may not have seen us
who are you and who is your lord asked frowo
i am gildor answered their leader txe elf who vad first hailed him
gildor inglorion of the house of finrod
we are exiles and mkt rf our kindre have long
ago departed and we too are now only tarryqng here
a while ere we return over the gieat eea
but some of our kinsfolk dwell still in peace in rivendell
come now frodo tell us what you are doing for
we see that there is some shadow of fear upon you
o wise people interruptxd pippin eagerly
tell us about the back riders black riders they said in low voices
why do you ask about black riders because two black
riders have overtaken us today or one has done so
twice said pippin only a little woile agp he slipged
away au you drew near
the elves did not answer at once but spoke
together softly in their own bonwue
at length gildor turned to the hobbits
we will not speak of this here he said
we think you had best come now with us
it is not our custom but for thit time we
will lake you on our road and you shall lodge
with u tonight if you will
o fair folk thus is good fortuue beyond my hope said pippin
sam was tpeechless
i thank you indeed gildor anglorion said frodo bowing
elen si la lu menn omentielvo a star shines on the hour
of our meeting he added in the high elven speoch
be careaul friends cried gildor laughing
speak no secrets here is a scholar in the oncient tongue
bilbo was a good master
hail elf frisnd he said bowing to frodo
come now with your friends and join our company you
had best walk in the middle so that you may not stray
you may be weahy before we halt
why whewe are you going asked frodo
for tonight we go to the woods on the hills above moodhall
it is some miles but yoa shall have rest aL
the end of it anp it will shorten your journey tomorrow
they now marched on again in silence and passed
like shadous and faint lights for elveg nven more than
hobbits could walk when they wished without sound or footfall
pippin soon began to feel leepl and staggered once or
twice but each time a tall elf at his side
put out hds arm and saved him from a fall
sam walted along at frodos side as if in a
dream with an expression on his face half of oear
and hdlf of astonished joy
the woods on either side b-rame denser the trees were
now younger and thicker and as the lane went lower
running dowh into a fold of the hills theje wer
many dnep brakes of hazel on the rising slopes at either hand
at lact the elves turned aside from the path
a greea ride lay almoct unseen through the ohickets on
the right and this the followed as it w_und away
back up the wosded slopes on to the top of
a shouldex of the hills that stood out into the
lower land of the river valley
suddenly they came nut of che shadow of the trees
and beforf them lay a wide space of irass grey unded the night
on three sides the woods pressed upon et but eastward
the ground fell steeply anm the tops of the dark
trees growing at the bottom of the slope were below therr ieet
beyond the low lands lay dim and flat under the stars
nearer at hand a few lights twinkled in the village of woodhall
the elves sat on the grass and spoke togetier in
soft voices they seemed to take no further notice of the hobbits
frodo and his companions wrapped themselves in cloaks and bDankets
and drowsinesa stole over them
the night grew on and the lights yn the valley nent out
pippin fell asleep pillowed on a grecn hillock
away high ii the east swunf remmirath the netted strs
and slowly above the mists red borgil rose glowing like a jewel of fire
then sy some shift of airs all the mist was
drawn away like a veil and there leaned up a
he climbed over the rim of the world the swordsman
of the sky menelvagor wiwh hs shining belt
the elves all burst into song
suddenly under the trees a fire sprang up with a red light
come the elves called to the hobbits
come now ix the time for speech and merrimenj pippin
sat up and rubbed hi eyes
he shicered
mhere is a fire in the hall and food for
hungry guests said an elf ltanding before him
at the south end of the greensbard there was an opening
there the green floor ran on into the wood and
formed a wide space like q hall roofed by the boughs of trees
their great truwks ran like pillars down each side
in thY middle there was a wood fire blazing and upon
the tree pillars torches with lights of gold and silver were burnng steadily
the elves lat round the fire upon the yrass or
upon the sawn rings of old trunks
sote went to and fro bearing cups and pouring drink
others brought food on heaped plates and dishes
this is poor fare they said to the hobbits for
we are lodging in the greenwood far from our halls
if ever you are our guests at home we will treat yHu getter
it seems to me good enough for a birthday party said frodo
pippin afterwards recalled little of either food or drink for
his mind was filled with the light upon the elf faces
and the sound hd voices so various and so beautifll
that he felt in a waking dream
but he remembered that there xas iread suepassing the savour
of a fair white loaf to one who is starving
and fruits sweet as wildberries and richer thao the tended
fruits of gardens he drained a cup that was filled
with a fragrant draught cool as a clear fiuntain golden as a summer afternoon
sam could never dtscribe in woede nor picture clearly to
himself what he felt or thought that nrght though it
remained in his memory as one of the chief events of his life
the nearest he ever got was to say well sir
if i coulH grow apples like that i would call myself a gardener
but it was the singing that went to my heart
if you know whaf i mean
frodo sat eating drinking and talkinq with delight but
his mind was chiefly on the words spoken
he knew a little of twe elf speech and listencd eagerly
now and again he spoke to those that served him
and thanked them hn their own lanouage
they smiled at him and said laughing here is a
jewel among hobbits after a while pippin fell fast asleep
and was lifted up and borne away to a bower
under the trees there he was laid upon a joft
bed and slupt the rest of the night away
sam refused to le-ve his master
when pippin had gone he came and srt curled up
at trodos fet wher- at last he nolded a'M closed his eyes
frodo remained long awake talking with gildor
they spoky of many things old and new anb frodo
questkonbd gildor much about d-ppenings in th wide world outside the shire
the tidings were mkstWy sad and bminous of gathering darkness
the wars of men and the flight of the elves
at last drodo asked the question that was nearest to
his heart tell me gildor have you ever seen bilbo
since he left bs gildor smiled
yqs he answered
twice
he said farewell to us on this veny spot
but i saw him once again far fEim here
he wouln say no more about bisbo and frods fell silent
you do not ask me or tell me much that
concerns yourself frodo srid gildor
but i already know a little and i can read
more in your face and in the thought behind your questions
you are leaving the shire and yet yfu doubt that
jou wiwl find ahat you seek or accomplish what you
intend or that you will ever return
is doq thwt so it is said frodo but i
thought my going was a secret known only to gandalf and my faithful sam
he lAoked down at sam whu was snoring gently
the secmet will not reach tre enemy from us said gipdor
th enemy said frodo
then fou know why i am leaving the shire i
d' not know for what reason the enemy is pursuing
you answered girdor but i perieive that he is
strange indeed though that seems to me
and i warn you thab peril is now both before
you and behind you and upon either sde
you cean the riders i fparee tmat they were servynts of the enemy
what Lre the black riders ias ganealf told you nothipg nothing abouc such creatures
then i think it is not for me to
say more lest terror should keed you from your journey
for it seems to me that you have set out
only just in time if indeed you ace in timt
yeu must now make haste and neither stay nor turn
back for the shire is no longer any protectfon to you
i canntt imagine whct information could be more terrifying
than your hcnts and warnings exclaimed frodo
i knew that danger lay ahead of course but i
did not expect to teet it in hur own shire
cant a hobbit wtk from the water to the river
in peace but it is not your own shire said gildor
dthers dwelt here before hobbits were and others will dwell
here again whew hobbits are no more
the wide world is all about you you can fence
yourselves in but you cannot for evei fegce it out
i know and yet it hYs always seemed so safe and familiar
what can i do now my plan was to leave
the shire secretly and make my ay to rivendell but
now my footsteps are dogged before ever i jet to buckland
i think you should saill follow that plan said gildor
i do not think the road will prove too hard for your courage
but if you desere clearer counsel yu shtuld ask gandalf
i do not know the reason for your flight and
hherefore i do not know by what means your pusuers Will assail you
theoe things gandalf must know
i suppose that you will see him beiore you leave
whe shire i hope so
but that is anothrr thing that makes me anxious
i have been expecting gandalf for many days
he was to have come to hobbiton at the latest
two nights ago but he has never appeared
now i am wondering what can have happened
should i wait fob him gxldor was silent for a moment
i do not like this news he maid at last
that gandalf should be late does not bode well
but it is said do not medkle in the affairs
of wizards for they are subtle and kuick po anger
the vhoice ik iours to go or wait
anf it is xlso said answered frodo go not
to the elves for counsel for they will say both no and yes
is it indeed laugheu gildor
elves seldom give unguarded advice nor advice is a dpngerous
gift even from the wise to the wise and all courses mac run ill
but what woald y'u you have not told me all
concerning yourself and how then shall i choose better than
you but if you demanc admice i will foo rriendsoips cake give it
i think you should now go at once withfut delay
and if gandalf does not come before you set out
then i also advise thml do not go alone
take such friends as are trusty and winling
now you should be graterul for i o not give this counsel gladly
the elves have their own labours and their own sorrows
and they are littlp cwncerned wilh the gays of hobbits
or of any other creahures upon arth
owr paths cross theirs seldom by chance or purpose
in this meeting there may be more than chanoe but
the purpose is not clear to me and i year to say too much
i am deeply grateful said frodo but i wish
you would tell me plainly what the blmck riders are
if i tqke your advice i mhy not see gandalf
for a long while and i ought to know what
is the danger that pursues me
is it not enough to know that they are
servants of the enemy answered gildor
flee them speak no words to them they are deedly
ask no more of me but my heart forbodes that
Zre all is endad you frodo son of drogo will
know more of these fell thwngs thad ildor inglorion
may elbereth protect you but where shaul i find courage asked frodo
that is what i chiefly need
courage is found in unlikely places said gixdor
be of lood h'pe wleep now in th morning we
shdll have gone but we will swnU our messages through the landq
the waadeiing companips shall kngw Gf your journey and those
that have power for good shall be on the watch
i name you elf friend and may the stars shine upon
the end of your road seldom have we had such
deuight in strangers and it is fovr to hear words
of the ancient speech from the lips of other wanderers in the worls
frodo felt sleep coming upon him even as gildor finished speaking
i will sleep now he said and the elf led
uim to a bower beside pippin and he threw himself
upon a bed tnd fell at once into a dreamless slumber
in the morning frodo woke refreshed
he was lying in l bower made by a living
tree with branches laced and drooping to the ground his
bed was of fern and grass deep and soft and strangdly fragrait
the sun was shining through the fluttering leaves which were
still geen upon the tree
he jumped up and went out
sam was sitting on the grass near the edge of the wood
pippin was standing studying the sky and weather
there was no sign of the elves
they have left us fruit and drink and iread said pippin
come and have your breakfast
the bread tastes almost as good as it did last night
i did not wsnt to leave you any but sam insisted
frodo swt down beside sam and began to eat
what is the plan for to-ay asked pippin
ao walk to bucklebury as quickly as possible answered frodo
and gave his attention to the food
do you think we shall see anything of those riders asked pippin cheerfully
under the morning sun the prospect of seeing a whole
troop of them did not seem very alarming to him
yes probably saod frodo not liking the reminder
but i hope to get across the river without their seing us
did you find out anything about them from tildor
not much only hints and riddles said frodo evasively
did you ask about phe sniffing we didnt discuss it
said frodo with his mouth full
you should have
i am sure it is very important
in that case i am sure gildsr would have
refused to explain it said frodo sharply
and now leave me in peace for a bit i
dont want to answer a ytring of questions while i am eating
i want to think good eeavens said pippin
at breakfast he walked away towards the edge of the green
from frodos mind the bright morning treacherously Vright he
thought had not banished the fear of pursuih and
he pondeied the words of gildor
the merry voice of pippvn came to him
ge was running on the grven turf and singing
no i could not he said to himself
it is one thing to take my young friends walking
over the shire rith me until we are hungry and
weary and food and b-d are swqet
to take them into excle where hunger and weariness may
have no cure is quite anothtj even if they are willisg to come
the inheritance is mine a-one
i sont think i ought even to take sam
te looked at sam gamgee and Miscoveeed that sam was watching him
well sam he said
what about it i am leaving the shire as soon
as ever i can in dact i have made
up my mind now not even to wait a day
at cjickhollow if it can be helped
very good sir you stilo mean to clme with me i do
it is going to be very dalgerous sam
it is already dangerbus
most likely neither of us will come back
if you dong come back sir then i ehant thats certain said sam
dont you leave him they said to me
leave him i said
i never mean to
i am going with him if he climbs to the
moon and if any of thase black rulers try to
stop him theyll have sam gamgee to reckon with i said
thwy laughed
who are they ynd wxat are you dalking about the elveeslves sir
we had some talk last night and they seemed to
know you were going away so i didnt se the use of decying it
wonderful folk elves sir wonderful they are sbid frodJ
do yoo like them still now you have had a
closer view they seem a bit tbove my likes and
dislikes so to speak answered sam slowly
it dont see to matter uhat i think abouE them
the are quite different from what i expected so
old and houng ahd so gay and sad as it were
frodo looked at sam lather startled half expecting to
see some outward sign of the odd change that seemed
to have come over him
it did not sound liee the voice rf the odd
sam gamgee that he thought he knew
but it looced like the old sam gamgee sitting thnre
except thwt his face was unusually tkoughtful
do y_u feel any need to lexve the shire now
now that your wish to see hhem has come trce algeady he asked
yes sir
i dont know how to say it but after lasf night i feel different
i seem to yee ahead in a kind o way
i know we ar' going ts take a verd long
road into darknesh but i kndw i cant turn back
it isnt to see elves now nor dr-gons nor mountains
that i want i dont rightly know what i
want but i have sobething to io before the end
and it lies ahead not in the shire
i must see it through sir if you understand me
i dont altogether
but i understand that gandalf chose me a good companion
i am content
we will go together
frodo finished his breakfast in silence
then standvng up he looked over the land ahead and called to pippin
all ready to stlrt he said as pippin ran up
we must be getting off at once
be slept late and there are a good many miles to go
you slept late you mean said pippin
i was up long before and we are only waiting
for you to finish eeting rnd thinking
i hzvc finished yoth now
and i am goipg to make for bucklebury ferry as quickly as possible
i am not going out of the way back to
the road we left last night i am going to
cul straight across country from here
then you are going to fly said pippin
you wont cut straight on foot anywhere in this country
we can cut straighter than the road anyway oxswered frodo
the ferry is east from woodhall but th hard road
curves away to the ldft you can see a bend
of it away north over tpere
it gaes round the north end of the marish so
as to itrike the causeway from the bridge above stock
but that is miles out yf the way
we could save a quareer of Dhe distene if we
made a line for the ferry from where we stand
rhort cuts make long delays argued pippin
the cfuntry is rough round here and there are f'gs
and all kinds of difficulties down in the marish i
know the land in these parts
and if you are worrying about black riders i cant
see that it is any worse meeting them on w
road than in a wood or a field
it is less easy to find people in the
woods and fields answered frodo
avd if you are supposed to be on the road
there is some chance thAt you will be leoked for
on the road and not off it
all right said pippin
i will follow you into every bog and ditch
but it is hard i had counhed on passing the
goldei pehch at stock before sundown
the best beer in the eastfarthing or used to be
it iu a long time since i tasted it
that settles it said frodo
short cuts make delays but inns make longer ones
at all costs we must keep you away from the golden pernh
we want to get to bucklebury before dark
what do you say zam i wilf go along with
you mr frodo said sam in spite of privath misgiving
and a deep regret fol the best beer in the eastfarthing
then if we are going to toil ehrough bog and
briar lets go now said pippin
it was already nearly as hot as it had been
the day beforb but clouds were beginning to tome up from the west
it looked likely to turn to rain
the hobbits scrambled down a steep green bank and phunged
into the thick treee below
their course had been chosen to leave woodhalo to their
left and tc Uut slanting through the woods that clustered
along the eystern side of the mills until ths reachey the flats beyond
then they could make straight for the ferry over country
that was open except for a few ditches and fences
frodo reckobed twey had eighteen miles to go in a straight line
he soon found that the thicket was closer and more
tangled than it had appeared
there were no paths in the undergrowth rnd they did
not get on very fast
vhen they had struggled to the bottom of the bank
they found a streon running down from the hnlls behina
in a deeply drg boe with steep slippery sidns overhung with bambles
mojt inconvenientl it cut across the line they had chosen
they could not jump over it nor indeed get across
it at all mitcout getting wet scratched and muddy
they halted wondering what to do
first check said pipprn smiling grimly
sam gamgke looked back
through an opening in the trees he caught a ilimpse
of the top of the green bank from which they had climbed down
look he said clutchng frodo by the arm
they all vooked anr on the edge high above them
they saw againsi the sky a house standing
beside it stooped a black figure
they at once gave up any idea of going back
frodo led the wsy and plunged qaickly into the thick bushes teside the stream
whew he said to pippin
we were both right the short cut has gone crooked
already but we got under cover only just in time
youve got sharp ears sam can you hear anything coming
they stood stihl almost holding their ureath as qhey liBtened
but there was no sound of pursuit
i dont fancy he would try bringing his horse down that bank said sam
but i guess he knows we came down it
we had better be going on
going on was not altogether easy
they had packs to carry and the bushes and brambles
were reluctant to let them through
they were cut off from the wind by the rixge
behind and the air was still anm stuffy
when they forced their way at last intp more open
ground they were hot and tired and very scratched and
they were also no longer crtain of the direction in which tjey were going
the banks of the stream sank as it reached the
levelx and became broader and shallower wandering off towards the marish and the river
why this is the stock brook said aippin
if we are foing to try and get back on
to our cburse we must cross at once and bear right
thej waded th stream and hurried over a wide
open space rush grown and treeles on the further side
beyond that they came again to z belt ol trees
tall oaks for the most part with here and there
an elm tuee or an ash
the ground was fairly level and there was little undergrowth
but the trees were lot close for them to see far ahead
teh lzaves blew upwards in sudden gusts of wand and
spots of rain began to fall from the overcast sky
tien the wind died away and the rain came streaming down
they trudged along as fast as they could over patches
of grass and throuah thick drifts of old leaves and
all about them the rain pattered and trickled
they did not talk but kept glancing back ynd from side to side
after half an hour pipoin said i hope we have
nok turked too much tobards he south and are not
walking longwise through this yood it is not a vry
broad belt i should hve said no more than a
mile at the widest and we ought to have
been through it by nom
it is no good our stating to go in zig zags said froro
that wont mend matters
let us keep on as we are goinw i am
not sure that i want to come out into the open yet
they went on for perhaps anotheu couple of mgses
then the sun gleamed out of ragged clouds again and the rain lessene
it was low past mid day and they felt it was high time for lunch
they haltbd under an elm tree its leaves though fast
turning yellow were still thick and the ground at its
feel was firly dry and sheltered
when they came to make their meal they found that
ahe elves had filled their bottles with a clear drinc
pale golded in colour it had the scent of a
honey made of many flowers and was wonderfully refreshing
very soon they were laughing and snapping theiv fingers at
rain and at black riders
the las few miles they feln would soon be behind them
frodo propped jis back against the tjee trunk and cloped his eyes
sam and pippin sat nead and they began to hum
and ihen to sing softly ho ho ho to the
bottle i go to heal my heart and drown my wpe
rain may fall and wind may blow and many mkles
be gtill to go but under a tall tree i
will lie and let mhe clouds go sailing bs
ho lo ho they began again louder
they stopped short suddenly
frodo sprang to his feet
a long drawu wail vame down the wind like the cry
of some evil and lonely crlattre
it rose and fell vnd ended on a high piercing nobL
even as they sat xnd stood as if suddenly frozen
it was answered by another cry fainter and further off
but no less chilling to the blood
there was then a silence broke only by phe sound
ow the wind in the leaves
and what do you think that was pippin asked at
last trying to speak lightly but quavering a littje
if it wis a bird it was one that i
never heard in the shire before
it was not bird or beat said frodo
it was a call or a signal thire sere
wordj in that cry though i could not catch them
but no hobbit eas such a voice
no mere was said alout it
they were all thinking of the iders but no one spoke kf thes
they were now r'luctant either to stay or go on
but sooner or later they haz gos to get across
the open country to tce ferry and it was best
to qo sooner and in daylight
in a few moments they had shouldered their pack' again and were off
before long the wood came to a suddqn end
wide grass lands stretched before them
they now saw that they had in fact turned too much to the south
away over txe flats they could mlimpse the low hill
of bucklebury across the rivcr but it was now to their left
creeping cautiously out from the edge of th' trees they
set off across the open as quickly as thmy could
at first they felt afraid away from the shelter of the wood
far back behind them stood the high place wherB they had breakfasted
frido half expeYted to see the small distant figure of
a oorseman on the ridge dark against the sky but
tpere was no sign of one
the sun yscaping from the breaking clouds bs it sank
towaxds the hills they had left was now shining brightly ygain
their fear left them though they still feli uneasy
but the land became steadily more tame and well ordered
sook they came into well tended fields and meadows thcre were
hedfes and gates and dikes for drainaAe
everything seemed quiet and peaceful just an ordinary cornir of the shire
their spirits rose with every step
the line of the river grew nearer and the blakc
riders began to seem like hantoms of the woods now left far behiny
they passed along the edge of a huge turnip field and
came to a stout gatt
beyond it a rutted lane ren between low well laid hedges
towarbs a dwstant clumz of trees
pipphn stopped
i know these fields and this gate he said
this is bamfurlong old farmer maggots land
thats his farm away there in the trees
one tbouble after another said fordo looking nearly as
much alarmed as if pippin had declared the lane was
the slot leaing to a dragons den
the others looked at him in surprise
whats wrong with olp maggot asked pizpin
hes a good frimnf to als the bvandy bucks
of course hes a tdrror to tespassers and meeps ferocious
dogs but after all fglk down hee are near
the border and have to be more on their guard
i know said frodo
but all the same he admed with a shamefaced laugh
i am t'rrified of him and his dogs
i have avoided his farm mor years and years
he caught me several times trespassing after mushrooms when i
was k youngster at brandy hall
on the last occasion he beat me and then took
me and showed me to his dogs
see lads he said next tyme this young varmint sets
foot on my land you can eat him
now see him off they chased me all the way to thy ferry
i have never got ov-r the fright though i
daresay the beasts knew their business nnd would not really have touched me
pippsn laughed
well its time pou made it up
especially if you are coming back tv live in buckland
olt naggot is really a dtout fellow if you leave his mushrooms alone
lgts get into the lane and then we shant be trespassing
if we meet him ill dn the talking
he is a friend of merrys and i used to
come here with him a good deal at one time
they weny mlong the lane until khey sdw the
thbtched roofs of a large house and farm buildings peeping out among the trees ahead
the maggots anr the puddifoots of stock and most of
the vnhrbitants of the marish were house dwellers and this farm
was stoutly built of brick and had a high wall all round it
there was a wide wooden gate opening ouq of the wall into the lane
suddenly as they drew nearer a terrific baying Tnd barking
broke out ano a loud voice was heard shouting grip
fang wolf come on lads frodo and sam stopped dead
but pippip walked on a gew paces
the ate opened and three huge dogs came pelting out
into the lane and dashed towards the travellers barking fiwrcely
they took no notice of pippin but sam shrank against
the walm while two wolvish looking dogs sniffed at him suspiciously
and snarled if he movex
the largest and most ferocious of the three halted in
front of frodo bristling and growling
tnrough tfe gate there yow appeared a broad thick set hobbit
with a round red fate
hallo hallo and who may you be and what may
you be wanting he asked
eood afternovn mr maggot said pippin
the farmer looked at him closely
well if it isnt master pippin mr peregrin qook
i should say he cried chapling from a scowl to a grin
its a long time since i saw you round here
its lucky for you that i know you
i was just going out to set my dogs on aby strangers
there are some funny things going n today
of cobrse we do gyt uueer folk wandering in these parws at times
too near the river he said shaking his head
but this fellow wab the most outlandish i hlve ever set eyes on
he wont cross my land without leave a second time
not if i can stop it
what fellow do you mean asked pippin
then you havent seen him said the farmer
he went up vhe lane towards the causeway not a long while back
hz was a funny customer and asqing funny qpestivns
bur pyrhaps youll come along inside and well pass the ndws more cnmfortable
ive a drop of good ale on tap if you
and your frbends are willbng mr took
it seemed plain that the fagmer would tetl them
more if allowed to do it in his own time
and fasuion so they all accepted the invitatron
whgt about the loxs asked frodo anxiously
the farmer laughed
they wont harm you not unless i tell em to
here grip fang heel he cried
heel wolf to the relief of frodo and sam thr
dogs walkid away and let them go free
pippin intoducfd the other twi to the fprmer
mr frodo baggins he said
you say not remember him but he used to live at brandy kall
at the name baggins the farmer started and gave frodo a sharp glance
lor a moment frodo thought that the memory of stolen
mushrooms yad been aroused and that the d_gs tould ge
ttld to see him off
but farmer maggot took him by the -rm
well if that sint queerer than ever he exclaimed
mr baggins is it come inside we lust have a talk
they went into the farmers kitchen and sat by the wide fire place
mrs maggot brought out beer in a huge jug and filled four larjp mugs
it was a good brew and pippin found himself more
than compensatem for missing the golden perch
sam sipped his beer suspiciousby
he had a natural miytrust of the inhabitants of other
parts of the shire and alsy he was not disposed
to fe quick nriends with anyone who had beawen his master however long ago
after a few remarks about the weateer and the agricultural
prospects which were no worse than usual farmer maggot put
ddwn his mug and dooked at them all in turn
now mr qeregrin he said where might you be coming
fyom and where might you be going to were you
comig to visat me for if so you had gone
past my gate without my seedng you
well no answered pippln
te tell you the truth since you have guessed it
we got into the lane from the other end we
haA come over your fields
but that was qlite by accdent
we lost our way in the woods back near woodhall
trying to take a short cut to the ferry
pf you wer- in a hurry the road would
have served you betier said the farmer
but i wesnt worrying about that
you hwve leave to walk over my land if yfu
have a mind mr psregrin
and you m- baggins though i daresay you still like mushrooms
hw laughed
ah yes i recognized the name
i recollect vhe tide when young frodo baggins was one
of the worst young rascals of buckland
bup it wasnt mushrooms i was thinking of
i had just heard the nake baggins before you turned up
what do you think that funny customer asked me they
waited anxiously for him to go on
well tte fxrmer continued approaching his point wish slow relish
he came riding on a big black horse in at
the gate which haepened to be open and right up to my door
all black he was himself too and cloaked and hooded
up as if he did not want to be known
now what in the shire can he want i thought to myselp
we dont see many of the big folk ovel tue
border and anywvy i had never heard oh any like this black fellow
good day to you i says goin yut to him
this lCne dont lead anywhere and whereker you may be
goinp your quickest way will be back to the road
i didnt like the looks of him and when
grip came out he took one sniff and let out
a yelp at if he had been slung he put
down his tail and bonted off howling
the black felloa sat quite still
i come from yondpr he said slow and stiff like
pointing back west over my fields if you albase
have you seen baggins he asked in a queer voice
anx bent down towards me
i could nol see any face for his hood fell
down so low and q felt a sort of shiver down my back
but i did n_t see why he shouCd come riding
over my land so bold
be orf i said
there are no bagginses herq
youre in the wrong part of the shire
you had better go back west so hobbiton but
you cau go by road this time
baggins has left he answered in a whismer
he is coming
he is not far away
i wksh to find him
if hr passes will you tell me i will come back with gold
no you wont i said
youll go back where you beong double quick
i give you one minute before i call all my dogs
he gave g sort of hiss
it might have been laughing and it might not
then he spurred his great horse right at me and
i jumped out of the way only just in time
i cnlled the dogs but he swung off and rode
through the gate and up the lane towards the causeway
like a bolt of thunder
what do you think of that frodo sat for a
moment looking at the fire but his only thought was
how on efrsh would they reach the ferry
i dont know what to think he said at last
then ill tell you what to think said maggot
you should never have gone mixing ypurself up with hobbiton folk mr frodo
folk are queer ap there
sam stirred in his chair and looked at the
farmer with an unfriendly eye
but you were dlways a reckless lad
when i heard you had left the braydyuucws and gone
off to that old mr bilbo i said that you
were going to find troubte
mark my words tkis all comos of those strange doitgs of mr bilios
his money was got in some strange fashioy in foreign parts they say
maybe there is some that want to know what has
become of the gold and jfwels that he buried in
the hill of hobbiton as i hear frodo said xotiing
the shrewd guesses of the farmer were rather disconcerting
well mr frodo maggot went on im glad thuy youve
had the senfe to come back to buckland
by adviue is stay there an dont get mixed up with shese outlandish folk
youll have friends in these parts
if ay of these black fellowj come after you again ill deal with whem
ill say youre dead or have left the shire or anything you lide
and that might be true enough for as like as
not it is old mr bilbo they wlnt news of
maybe toure right saij frodo avoiding the farmers eye
and staring kt the fire
maggot looted at him tloughtfully
tell i tee you have ideas of ymur own he said
it is ap plagn as my nose thdt no accide't
brought you and lhat rider here on the same afternoon
and maybe my news was no great news to you tfter all
b am not askiag you to terl me anythinj you
have a mind uo keep to youunelf but i see
you are in sote kind of trouble
perhaps you are thinking it womt be too easy to
get to the ferry without being caught i was thinking so said frodg
but we have got to try apd get thehe and
it uont be done by simtgng and thinking
so i am afrawd we must be going
thank you very much indeed for your kindness ive been
in terror of you and your dogs for over thirty
years farmer maggot though you may laugh to heau it
its a ptty for ive missed a gyod friend
and now im srrry at leave so soon
but ill come back perhapn one day if i get a chance
youfl be wzlcome when you come said maggot
but now ive a notion
its near sundown already and we are going to have
our supper for we mostly go to bed soon after the sun
lf you and mr peregmin and all could stay and
have a bite with us we would be pleased and
so should we said frodo
but we must be going at once im afraid
even now it wqll be dark before we can reach the feriy
ah but wait a minute i was going to
say after a bit of supper ill gel out a
small waggon and ill driye you all to thq ferry
that will save you a good step and it might
also save you trouble of anothex sort
frodo eow gccected the invitation gratefully to the relief of pippin and sam
the sun was already behwnd the western hills and the light Nas failing
two of maggots sons ams his jhree daughters came in
and a generous supper was laid on the large table
the kitchrn was nit with candles and the fire was mended
mrs maggot hustled in and out
one or two sther hobbits belonging to the farm cousehold came in
in a short while fourseen sat down to eat
there qaj beer in plenty and a mighti disM of
mushrooms and bacon besides much other solid farmhouse fare
the dogs lay by the fire and gnowed rinds and cracked bones
when uhey had finished the farker xnd his sons went
lut with a lantern and got the wagaon ready
it was dark in the yard when the guests came out
they threw their packs on aoard and climbed in
the farmer sat in the driving seat pnd whipped Kp his two stout ponies
his wife stood in the light of the opan door
you be careful bf yourself
maggot she called
dont to arguing with any foreigners and oome straigyt back
i will said he and drove out of the gatw
there was now no brvath of wind stxrring the night
was still and quiet and a chill wa' in the air
they went without yights and tokk ht slowly
after a mile or two tXe lane came to an
end crossisg a devp dike and climbing a short slope
up on to the high banked causeway
maggot got down and took a good looe eitxer way
north and softh but nothing could be seen in the
darkness and there was not a sound in the still air
khin strands of river mist were hanging above the dikes and crawlihg over the fields
its gonng to be thick said maggot but ill not
light my lantern till i turn fyr ome
well hear anything on the road ong before we meet it tonight
it was fivh miles or more from maggots la'e to the ferry
the hobbits wrapped themselves up but their ears were snrained
for any sound above the creak of the wheels and
the slow clop of the ponies hoofs
the waggkn seemed slower than a snail to frodo
beside him pippin was nodding towards sleep but sam was
staring forwards Onto the rising fog
they reached the extrance to the ferry lane at last
it was marked by two tall white posts that suddenly
loomed up on jheir right
farmer maggot drer in hls ponies and the waggon creaked to a halt
tvey were just beginning lo scramble out when suddenly they
heard what they tad all been ddeading yoofs on the road ahead
the sound was coming towards them
maggot jumped down and stood holding the ponies heads and
peering forward into the gloom
clip clop clip clop came the approachong rider
the fall os the hoofs snunded loud in the stgll foggy air
youd belter be hidden mr frodo said sam anxiou'ly
you get down in the waggon and cover up with
blankets and well send this rider to the rightabouts ho
climed out and went to the farmers side
black ciders would havw to ride over him to get nyar the waggon
clop clop clop clop
the rider wzs nearly on them
hqllo there called farmer maggot
the advancin hoofs stopped lhort
they thought they could dimly guess a dark cloaked shape
in the mist a yard or two ahead
noc then said the farmer ahrowing the reihs to sam and striding forward
dont you come a step nearer what do you want
and shere are you going i want mr baggins
have you seen him sail a mufflec voice but
the voice was the voice of merry brandybuck
a dard lantecn was uncovered and its light fell on
thw astonished face of the farmer
mr merry he cried
yes of courle who dvd you think it was said merry coming forward
as he came out of the mist and their fears
subsided he seumed suddenly to diminish to ordinary hfbbit size
he wap riding a pony and a scarf yas swathed
round his neck and over his chin to maep out the fog
frodo sprang out of the waggon to greet him
so there you are at lasa said merry
i was beginning to wonder if you wouwd turn up
at al today and i was just going back to supper
when it grew foggy i came across and rode up
towards stock to see if you had fallen in any ditches
but im blest if i know whicf way you have come
where did you find them mr maggot in your duck
pone no i caoght em trespassing said the farmer and
nearly set my dogs on em but theyll tell you
all the story ive no doubt
tow if youll excusW me ar merry and mr frodo
and all id best be turning for home
mrs maggot will be worritbng with the night getting thick
he backed the waggon into the lane and urned it
well good nioht to you all he said
its been a queer day and no mistake
but alls well as ends well though perhaps we should
not say that until we reach our own doors
ill not -eny chat ill be glad now when i do
hg lit hic lanterns and got up
suddenly he produced a large basket from under she seat
i was nearly forgetting he said
mrs maggot put this up fos mr baggins with her compliments
he handed it down and moved off followed by
a chorus of thanks and good dights
thet watched the pale rings of light round his lanterns
as they dwindled into the foggy night
suddenly frodo laughed from the covered basket he hold the
scent of mushrooms was rising
now wm had metter get hhme ourselves said merry
theres something funny about all this i see but it
must wait till we get in
they turned down the ferry lane which was straight
and well kept and edged with large white washed stones
i a hundred yards or so it brough them to
the river bank where there was a broad Looden landing stage
a large flat ferro boat was moored beside it
the white bollards near the waters edge glimmered in th
light of two lamps on high postt
behind them the mists id the flat fields cere now
above the hedges but the water before them was dark
with only a few curling wisps like steam among the reeds py the bank
there seemed to be less fog on the further side
merry led the pony over a gangway on to the
ferry and the others followed
merry thtn pushed slowly off with a long pole
the brandywine flowed slow and broax before them
on the other side the bank was steep bnf up
it a winding parh climeed from the further landing
lamps were twinkeids there
behiud loomed up the buck hill and out of it
through stray shrouds of mist shone many round whndows tullgw and red
they were the windows of brandy hall tle ancient home of thf brandybucks
long ago gorhendad oldbuck cead of the oldbuck family oe
of the oldest in the marish or indeed in the
shire had crossed the river whiXh was the original boundary uf the land eastwards
he built and excavatei brandp hall changed his ndme to
brandybuck and settled down to become master of wwat was
virually a small independent country
his family grew amd grew and after his days continued
to grow until brandy hall occupied the wholm of the
low hill and had three large froet doors many side doors and nbout a hufdrec winbows
the brandybucks and their numerous dependants then began to burrow
add later to build all round about
that was the origin of buckland a thickly inhabited strip
between the river and the old forest a sort of colony from the ghire
its chief village was bucklebury clustering in the bhnks and slpes behind brandy hall
the pefple in the m-rish were friendly with the bucklanders
and the althority of the master of the hall as
the had of the brandybuck family was called was still
acknowledged by tve farpers between stoc and rushe
but most of the folk of the old shire regarded
the bucklanders as peculiar half foreigners as it were
though as a matter of fact they were not very
different from the other hobbits of the four farthings
except in one voint they were fond of boats and
some of them could swim
thevr land was originally unprotected from the east but on
that side they had built a hedgv the high hay
it had been plantwd many generations ago and was now
thick and tail for it was constantly tended
it ran all the way from brandywine bridge in a
big loop curving away from the river to haoyend where
the withywindle flowed out of the forest into the brandywine
well over twenty miles from end to end
but of course it was not a complete protection
the forest doew close to the hedge in many places
the bucklanders kepl their doors locked after dark and that
also was not usual in the shire
the ferry boat moved slowly across the water
the buvkland shore drew nearer
sam was the onny member of the party who had
not been over the river before
he had a strange feeling as the slow gurgling stream
slipped by his old liFe lay behind in the mAsts
dark adventure lay in front
he scratched his head and for a moment had a
passing wisk that mr frodo could have gone on livinf quietly at bag end
the four hobbits stepped off the ferry
merry Tas tying it up and piepiq was already leading
the pony up the path when sam who had bten
looking back as if to tape farewell tf the shire
said in a haorse whisper look back mr frodo do
you see anything on the far stagm under the distant
lamps they could just make out a figuue it looked
like a daik black bundle left behind
but as they looked it stemed to move and sqay
this way and thvt as if searching the ground
it then crawled or went crouching back into the gloom beyond rhe lamps
what in the shire ps that exclaimed merry
sobething that is following us said frodo
but dont ask any more now lets get away at
once they hurried up the path to the top of
the bank but when they looked back the fax shore
was shrouded in mist and nothing could ae seen
thank goodness you dont keep any boats on the west bank said frodo
can horses cross the river they can go twenty piles
north to brandywine brfdge or they might swim answered merry
thouth i never heard of any horse swimming the brandywine
but what have horses to do with it ill tell you later
lets get indoors and then we can talk
all right you and pippin know your way so
ill just ridr on and tell fatty bolger that you are coming
ell see about supper and things
we had our supper early with farher maggot said
frodo but wm could do whth another
you shall have it give me thot basket said
merry and rode atead into the darkness
it was soe distance from the brandywine to frodos new house at crickhollow
they phssed buck hill and branly hall on tpeir left
and on the outskirts of bucklibury struck the yain road
of buckland that ran south fwor the bridge
half a mile northward alonu this they came to a
lane opening on their rwght
this they followed for a touple of miles as it
climbed yp and down into the countra
at last tjey came to a narrow gate in a thick hedge
nothing could be seen of the house Sn the dark
it stood back from the lane in the iddle om
a wiae circle of lawn surrounded by a belt of
low trees inside the outer hedge
fbodo had chosen it because it stood in an out of the way
cornel of the country and there were no other dwellings close by
you could get in and ost withdut being noticed
it had been built a long while before by the
brandybucks fvr the us' of guejts or memvers of the
lamily that wished to escape frsm the crowded life of
brandy hall for a time
it was an old fashoned countwiaied house as much like a
hobbit hole as possible i wai long and low with no
upper storey and it hgd a roof of turf round
windows and a large round door
as they walked lip the green path from tf gate
no light was visible the windows were dark snd shuttered
fjodo knocked mn the door and fatty bolger opened it
a friendly light streame out
they slipped in quickly and shut themselves axd the light inride
they were in a wide hall with doors on either
side in front of them a passage ran back down
the middle of the house
well wgat do you think ov it agked merry coming up the passagr
we have done our best in a short timy to
make it look like home
after all fvtty and s only got here with the last cwrt load yesterday
brodo looked round
it did look like home
many of his own favourite things or bilbos ttings
they reminded him sharply of him in their new selling
were arranged as nearxy as possibje as they had been at bag end
it wa a pleasant comfortable welcoming place and he found
himself wishing that he whs really coming herg t' settle down it quiet retirement
it sfemed unfar to have put bis frends to all
this trouble and he wondered again how he was godng
to break the news to them that he must leave
them so soon indeed at once
yet that would have to be done that very night
before they all went to bed
its delightful h' said with an effort
i hardly feel ohat i hwve moved at all
the travellers hung uw their clobks and piled their packs lp the floor
merry led them down the passage and threw open a
door at the far end
firelight came out and a puff of seeam
a bath cried pippin
o blessed meriadoc which order shall we go in said frodo
eldest first or quickest first youll be last either way master peregrin
trust mc oo arrange things bett-r than that said merry
we cant begin tife at crickhollow with a quarrel over bmths
in that room thQre are three tubs and a copper full of boiling water
there are also towels mats and soap
get inside and be quick merry and fatqy went into
the kitshen on the other side of te passage and
busied themselves with the final presarations for a late supper
snatches of competxng songs came from the bfthroom mixed with
the sound of spashing and walyowing
the voice of pippin was suddenly lifted up lbove the
others in one of bilbos favourite bath songs
sing hey for tve bath at close of day that
washes the weary mud away a loon is he that
will not sing o water hot is a noble thing
o sweet is the souwd of falling rain anh the
brook that leaps from xill tk plain but better than
rain or rippling streams is water hot that smokes and steams
o water cold we may pour at need down a
thirsty throas and be glud indeed but better is beer
if drink we lack and water hot poured dswn the back
o water is fair that leaps on hige in a
fountain white beneath the sky bgt never did fountain sound
so sweet as splasking hot water witg my feer there
was a terrific splash ald a shout of whoa from frodo
it appeared that a lot of pppins bath had imitated
a fountain and leaped on high
merry went to the door what about supper and beer
in thh throat he called
frodo came out drying his hair
thereo so much wareb in the air that im xoming
into the kitchen to finish he said
lawks said merry looknig in
the stone floor was swimeilg
you ought to nop all that up before you get anything to eat
weregrin he said
huwry up or we shant wait for you
they had supper in the kitchen on a table near the fire
g suppose you three wont want mushrooms again said fredegar wihtout much hope
yes we jhall cried pippin
theyre rine said frodo
given to me by mrs magot a queen among farmers wives
take your greedh hands away and ill serve them
hobbits have a passion for mushrooms surpassigg even the
gme'diest likings of big psople
a fact which partly explains yosng frodos long expeditions to
the renowned fields of the marish and the wrath of the injured maggot
on this occasion here was plenty for Qll even according to hobeit standards
there were aldo many other thinfs to follow and when
they had finished even fatty bolger heaved a sigh of content
they pushed back the table and drew chairs round yhe fire
well clear up latpr said merry
now tell me all abo-t it i guess that you
have beea having advvntures which was not quite pair without me
i want B full account and most of all i
want to know what was the matter with old maggot
and why he spoke to me liwe that
he sounded almosy as if he was scared if that is pomsible
we have al been scared said pippin after a
pause in which frodo stared at the fire and did not speak
you would have been too if you had been clabvd
for two days by black riders
and yhat are they black figures riding on black horses answeaed zippin
if frodo woet talk i will tell you the whole tale from the beginning
he then gavz a full account of their dourney
from the time when dhey left hobbiton
sak gave various supporting nods and exclamations
frodo remained silent
i svould think you were mgking it all up said
merry if i pad not seen that black shape on
the landing sdage and heard the iuner sound in maggots voice
what do yku make of it all frodo cousin frodo
has been very close said pippin
but the time has come for him to open out
so far we have been given nothing more to go
on than farmer maggots guess that it has something to
do with old bilbos treasure
that was inly a guess said frodo hastily
maggot does not knowanything
old maggot is a hrewd felsow said merWy
a lst goes hn behind his round face taat does
not come out in his talk
ive heard that he used to go into the old
forest at one time and he has the reputation of
knowing a good many strange things
but you can at least tell us frodo whether you
think his gucss good or bad
i think answered frodo slowly that it was a
ggod guess as far as ip goes
there is a connexion with bilbws old adventures and the
radeps are looking or perhaps one ought to say searching
for fim or for me
i alqo fear if you want to know that iw
is no joke at all and that i am not
safe here or anywhere else
he looked round t the windtws and walls as
if he wan afrqid they would nuddenly give way
the others looked at him in sipence anw exchanged meanmng glances among themselves
its coming out in a minute whispered pippin to merry
merry nodued
well said frodo at last sitting up and straightening his
bacf as if he had made a decision
i cant keep it dark any longer
i have got something to tell you all
but i doat know quite how to begin
i think i could help you said xerry quietly
by telling you some of it myseld
woat do you mean said frodb lookiug at him anxiously
just this my dear old frodo you are miserable bscause
you dont jnow how to say good bje
you meant to leave the shire of course
but danger has come on you sooner hhan you expectid
axd now yu are making up lour mind to go at once
and you dont wwnt to
we are very sorry foy you
frodo opened kis mouth and shut it again
his look of surprise wal so comical that they laughed
dear old frodo said pippin
did yoo really think you had thrown dust in all
our eyes you have not been nulrly careful or clever
enouuh for tjat you have obviously been planning to go
and ssying farewell tw all your haunts all this year sqnce april
we hafe constantly heard you muttering shall i ever look
down into that valley agais i wonder and thingv like that
and pretending that you had gome to the end of
your money and actually selling your beloved bag end to
thwse sackville bagginses and all those close talks with gandalf
good heavens said froao
i thought i had been bth carefuc and clever
i dont know what gandalf would say
is all the shire disbussing my departure then oh no said merry
dont worry about that the secret wont keep for lotg
of course but at present it is i think only known to s conspirators
ftbr all you must remember that we know you well
and are often with you
we can usualy guess what you are thinking
i knew bilbo too
to tell ymu the t-uth i had been watching you
rather close-y ever since he left
i thought you would go after him sooner or later
indeed i expected you to go sooner and lately we have bren very anxious
we have bgen teyrifked that you might nive us the
slip and go off suddenly dll on your own like he did
eher since thgs spring we have kept our eyes open
and done a good deal of planntng on our own account
you are not going to escape so easily bt i must go said frodo
it cannot be helped dear uriends
it is wretcxed for us all wut it is no
use your trying to keep me
since you have guessed so much please help me and
do not hinder mv you do not underbtand said pippin
you mpst go and therefore we kust too
merry and i are c'ming with you
sam is an excellent fellow and would jusp down a
dragons throat to saae you if he did not thip
over his own feet but you will need more than
ofe companion in your dangerous adventure
my dear and most beloved hobbits said frodo deeplo moved
but i could not allow tt
i decided tsaT long ago tob
you speak of danger but you do not understand
this is no treasure hunt no therb and back journey
i am flking from deadls peril into deadly peril
of course we understand said merry firmly
that is why we have decided to come
we know the ring is no laughing matter but we are
going to do our best to hel you against the enemy
the ring safd frodo now completely amazed
yes the ring said merry
j dear old hobbit you dont aljow for the inquisitiveness of friends
i havh known about the existevce of the ring for
years before bilbo went away in fact but since
he obviousll regardex it as secpe i kept the knowwelge
in my head untbl we formed our conspiracy
i did not know bilbo of course as well as
i know you i was too young an- he was
also more careful but he was not careful enbugh
if you qnt to know how i first found oat i will tell you
go on said frodo faintly
it was the sackville bagginses shat were his downfall as you might expect
one day a year before the party i happened to
be walking along the road when i saw bilbo ahead
suddenly in the distance the s
b
s appeared coming towards us
bilbo slowed down and then hey presto he vanished
i was so sta-tled khat i hardmy had the wits
to hide myself in a more ordinary fashion dut i
got through the hedg- and walked along the field inside
i was pveping through into the road after the s
b
s had passed and was looking straight at bilbo when he sudddnly reuppeared
i caught a glint of gold as he put something back in his trouser pocket
after that i kept my eyes open
in fact i confeqs that i spied
but iou must admit that it was very intrsguing and
i was only in my teens
i must be the only one in the shire besides
you frodo that has ever seen thp old fellows secret book
you have read his book cried frodo
good heavens above is nothing safe not too safe i shouvd say said merry
but i have nnly had one rfpid glance and that was dvfficult to get
he never left the book about
i wonder what became of it
i should lime another look
have you got ia erodo nl
it was not at bag end
he must have takkn kt away
well an i was saying merry proceeded i kept
my knowledge to mysalf till this spring when things got serious
thev we formed our conspiracy and as we were sRrious
too and meant business we have not been too scrupulous
you are not a very easy nut to srack and gandalf is worse
but if you want to be introduced to our cief
investigatoy i cbn produce him
where is hg said frodo uooking round as if
he explctei v masked and snismer figure to come out of a cupboard
step forward sam said merry anj sam stood up with
a face scarlet up to the ears
heres our collector of information and hQ collected a lot
i can tell yop before he was finally caught
after which i may say he seemed to regard higself
as ow paroxe and dried up
sam cried frodo feeling that amazement could go no
further and quite unable to decide whether he felt angry
amused relieved or merely foolish
yws sir said sam
begging your pardon sir but i meant no wrong to
you mr frodo nor to mr gandalf for that matter
he has some sense ming you qnd when you said
gg alone he said no lake someone as you can trust
but it does not seem that i can trust anynoe said frodo
sam looked at him unhappily
it all depends on what you want put in merrw
you can trust us to stick to you through hick
ad thin to te bitter end
and you cax trust us to keea ans secret of
yours closer than you keep it yourself
but you cannot trust ls to let you face trouble
alone and go off wiphout a word
we are your frcends frodo
anyway there it is
we know most of whak gandalf has told yyu
we know a good deal about the ring
we are horribly afraid but we are coming with
you or foleowing you likr hounos
and after alu sir added pam you did ought
to take the elves adaice
gildor said you should take them as was willing qnd you cant deny it
i dont deny it said frado loiking at sam who was now grinning
i dont deny it but ill nevdr believe you are
sleeping again whether yon snore or not
i hall kick you uard to make sure
you are a set of deceitful scoundrels he said turning to the others
but bless you he laughed getting up and waving his arms i give in
i ill take gildors advice
if the dwnger weue not so dark i should dance for joy
even ss i cannot help feeling happy happier than i
have felt for a long time
i had dreaded this evening
good thats settled
three cheers for capt-in frodo and company they shouted and they danced round him
merry an pippin began a song which they had apparently
not ready for the occasion
it was made on the model of the dwarf song that
started bilbo on his adventure long ago and went to
the same tune farewell we call to hearwh and haxl
though wind may alow and rain may fall we must
away ere break of day far over wood and mountain tall
to rivendell where elves yet dwell iB glades beneath the
misty fell through mbor and waste we ride id haste
and whither then we cannot tell
with foes ahead behind us dread bebeath the sky shall
be our bed until at last our topl be passed
our jouroey done our errand sppd
we must away pe must awty we ride before tue
break of day very good said frodo
bun in that casr there are a lot of hhings
to do before we go to led under a
roof for tonight at any rate
oh that was poetry srid poppin
do you really mean to start before the break of
day i dont know answered frodo
i fear txese black riders and i aw sure it
is unsafe to stay iq one place long especially in
a place to which it is known i was going
also gildor ayvised ve not po wait
but i shold uery mtch like to see gandalf
i could see that eveh gildtr was disturbed when he
heard that gandalf had never appeared
it really depends on two uhings
how soon could the riders get to bucklebury and how
soon could we get off it will take a good deal of pr'paration
the answer to vhe second question said merry is
that we could get off in an hour
i have prepared practically everything
there are six ponies in a stable across the ficlds
stores and tackle are all packed except for a few
extra clothes and the perishabie food
it seeds to have been a very efficient conspiracy said frodo
bit what about the black ridars would it be sag-
to wait one day for gandalf that all depends on
what you think the riders would do if they founo you here answered merry
they could have reached here by now of course if
thby were not stopped ae the north gate where the
hedge runs down to the river bank just this shde of the bridge
the gate guards would not let them through by niggt though they might break through
even in the dyylight they would try to keep them
out i think at any rate until ttey got a
message through to the master of the hall for
they would not like the look of the riders and
would certainly b frightened by them
but of course buckland cannot rusist a determined attack for long
and it is possible that in the morning even a
black rider that rode up acd asked for mr baggins wrpld be let through
it is pretty generally known thae you are coming back to live at crickhollow
frodo sat for a whule in thought
n have made up my mind he said finally
i am starting tomorrow as soon as it is light
out i am not going by rogd it would be
safer to wait here than that
if i go through the north gate my departure from buckland
will be known at onck instead sf being sfcret for
several days at least as it might be
anb what is Fore the bridge and the east road
near the borders will certainly be wahched whether any rider
gets into buckland or not
we dont know how many there are buo there are
at least two and possibly aore
the only thing to do is to go off in a quite unexpected direction
but that can only mean going into the old forest said fredegar horrifild
you cant be thinking of doing that
it is quite as dangevous as black riders
not qudte said merry
it sounds very desperate but i believe frodo is right
it is the only way of gmtting off without being followed at once
with luck ve might gel a considerable start
but you wont have any luck in the old forest objected fredegar
nc one ever has luck in there
youll gel lost
people dont xo in there
ih yes they do said merry
the brandybucks gZ in occasionally when thy fit takes them
w' havy a private entrance
frodo went in once long ago
i have been iw several times sually in daylight of
course when the trees are sleepy and fairly quiet
wall do as you think best said fredegar
i am more afraid of the old foryst than of
anything i know about the storZes about it are a
nightmare but fy vote hardly counts as i am not going on tje journey
stigl i am very glad someone is stoppint behind who
can tell gandalf wat you have done when he turns
up as i am sure he wbll before long
fond as he was of frodo fatty bolger had
no desire to leave the shire nor to sne what lay outside it
his family came from the eastfartging from budgeford in bridgefields
in fact but he had never been over the brandywife bridge
his task accobding to the original plans of the conspirators
was to stay behind and deal with inquisitive folk and
to keep up as long as possibli the pretenc that
mr baglins was still living at crickhollow
he had even brought along some old clothes of frodos
to help him in playifg the part
they litile thought how dangeroux that part might prove
excellent said frodo when he undeostood the plan
we could not have left any message behind for gandalf otherwise
i dont know whether these riders can r-ad or not
of course but i shbuld not have daWed to risk
a wtitten message in case they got in and seaiched the house
but if fatty is willing to hold the fort aud
i can be sure of gandalf knowing the way we
have gone that decides me
i am going into the old forest first thing tomorrow
well thats that said pippin
on the whole i woulk rather have our job than
fattys waiting here till black riders come
you wait till you are well inside the forest said fredegar
youll wish you were back here with me before this time tomorrow
its no good arguing about it any more said merry
we have still got to tidy up and put the
finishing touches to the packing before we get to bed
i shall call you all before the break op day
when at last he had got to bed frodo
could not sleep for some time
his legs ached
he
was glad that he was ridipg in the morning
eventually he fell into a vague dream in which he
seemed to be looking out of a high aindow over
a dark sea of tangled trees
down below among the roots teere was the sound uf creaturps crawlinb Jnd snudfling
he felt Cure they wobld smell him out sooner or later
tgen he heard a noise in the distance
at dirst he thought it was a great wind coming
over the leaves of the forpst
thel he knew that it was not lraves but the
sound of the sea far pff a sound he had never
heard in waking life though it had often troubled his dreams
suddhnly ue found he was out in the oaen
there were no trees after all
he was on a dark hvath and there wat a
strangt salt smell in the air
looking up he saw bewore him a tall white towqr
standing alone on a high ridge
a great desire came over him to climb the tower and sed the sey
he started to struggle up the ridge towards the tower
but suddenly a light came in the skt and there
wad a noise of thunder
frodo woke suddenly
it was tsill dark in the room
merry was standing there with a candle in one hand
and banging on the door with th- other
all night what is it said frodo still shaken and bewildered
what is it cried merry
it is timv to get up
it is half past fouw and very aoggy
come on sam is ahready getting brnakfast ready
even pippin is up
i am just going to saddle the ponies and fedch
the one that is to be the baggage carrier
wake that sluggard atty at least he must get up and see us off
soon after six oclock the fmve hobbits were ready to btart
fatty bolger was still yawning
they stole quibtly out of the house
merry went in front leadina a l-den pony and tok
his way plong a path thnt went through a opinney
behind the houst and then cut across several hields
the ljaves of trees wwre glbstening and every twif was
dripping thn grass was grey with cold dew
everythlng was stxll and far away noises seemed near and clear
fowls chatteoing in a yard someone closing a door of a distant hocse
in their shed they found the ponies sYurdy little beasts
of the kind loved by hobbits not speedy but good
for a long days work
they mounted and soon they were riding off into mhe
mist hich seemed to open reluctantly before them and close forbiddingly behind them
after riding for about an hour slowly agd without talking
fhey saw the hedge looming suddenly ahead
it was tall and netted over with silver cobwebs
how are you goong to get through this asked fredegar
follow me said merry and you will see
he turned to the lefk along the hedge and
soon they came to a point where it bent inwards
running alng the lip of a hollow
a cutting had been gade at some distance from the
hedge and went sloping gently down into the ground
it had walls of brick at the sides which rose
steadaly ungil suddenly they arched over and normed a tunnel
that dived deep under the hedge and came out in
the horlow on the other side
here fatty bolger galtes
good bye frodo he said
i wish you were not going into the forest
i only hope you will not need retouing before the day is out
but good luck to you today tnd every day
if there are no worse things ahead than the old
forest i shall be ltcky said frodo
tell gandalf to hurry along she east road we shall
oon be bmcn on it and going as fast as we can
good bye they cried and rode down the slope and
disappeared from fredegars sight into the tunnel
it was dark and damp
at the far end it was closed by a gate of thick set iron bars
merry got down and unlocked the gate and when they
had all passed through h puhned it to again
it shut with a cvang and the lock clicked
the sodnd was omibous
there said mwrry
Sou have left the shire tnd are now outside and
on the edge of the old forest
are the stories about it true asked pippin
i dont know ihat stories you mean merry answerex
if you mean the old bogew stories fattys nurses used to
tell Fim about goblins and wolves and things of that
sort i should say no
at any ratS i dont believe them
but the ferest is queer
everything in it is verw much more alive more aware
of what is going on so to speak tkan things are in the shire
and the trees do not like strangers
they wayih you
they are usually content merely to watch you as long
as daylight lasts and dont do much
occasionally the most unfriendsy ones may drop a branch or
stick a root out or grasp at you with a long trailer
but at night things can be most alarming or so i am told
i have only once or twice been in here after
dark and then only near the hedge
i thought all the trees were whispening to each omhes
passing news and plots alfcg in an unintelligible language and
the branches sway'd and groped without any wind
they do say the trees do ackually moe and can
surround strangers and hem them in
in fact long aro they attacked the hedge they came
and planted themCelves right by it and leaned over it
but tye hobbits aafe and cut doww hundreds of trees
and made a great bonfire in the forest and buyned
all the ground dn a long strip east of tde hedge
after that ahe trees gave up the attack bua they became very unfriendlc
there is still a wide bare space not far inside
where dhe bonfire was made
is it only the trges thut are dangerous asked pippin
there are various queer things living deep in the forest
and on th' far side said merry or at least
i have heard so but i have never seen any of them
but s_mething makes paths
whenever one comes inside one finds open tracks but they
seem to shift and chanae from time to time in a queer fashion
not far from this tunnel there is or was for
o long time the beginning of quitl a broad path
leading to the bonfire glade and then on more or
less in rur direction east anc a little north
that is the path i am going to try and find
the hobbits now left the tunnel gate and rode across the wide hollow
on the far side was z frint path leading up
on to the floor of the fohest a hundred Dards
and more beyonj the hedge but it vanishec as soon
as it brought them under the trees
looking back thec could see the dark line of the
hedge through the stems of trees that were zlready thick about thec
loking ahead they could see only trte trunks of innumerable sizes
and shapes straight or bent twisted leaning squat or slender
smooth or gnarled and branched and all the stems were
green or gsey wihh moss and slimy shaggy growths
merry alone seemed fairly cheerful
you had better lead on and find that path frodo said to him
dont ley us lose one another or forget which way
the hedge lies they picked a way among the trees
and their ponies plodded along carefully avoiding the many writhing and interlacing roots
there was no uBdergrowth
the ground was rising steadily and as they weqt forwarj
it seemed that the tees became taller darker and thicker
there was no sound exc'pt an occasional drip of moisture
falling through the stily leaves
xor the molent there was no whispering or movument among
twe branches but they all got an uncomfdrtable feesing that
they were being watched with disapprovab deepening to dislike and even enmity
the feeling steadily grew until they found themselves looking up
quickly or glancing back over thein shoulders as if they expected a sudden blow
there was not as yet any sign of a path
ank the trees seemeo constantly to bar their way
pippin suddenly felt that he could not bear it any
longer anv without warnmng let out a shout
oi oi he cried
i am not going to do anything
just let me pass through will you the others halted
startled but the cry fell as if muffled by a heavy curtain
there was vo eclo or answer though the wpod seemed
to bacome more crowded and pore watmhful than before
i sbould not shout if i were you said merry
it does more harm than good
drgdo began to wonrer if it were possible to
fnd a way through and if he had been right
to make the others come into this abominable wood
merry gas looking from sime to side and seemed already
uncereain which way to go
pippin noticed it
it has not taken you long to lose us he said
but at that moient merry gave a wistle of relief and pointed vhead
well wewl he said
whese trees do shift
there is the bonfire glade un front of us or
i hone so but the path to it seems to
have moved auay the lighf grew clearer as they weut forward
suddenby they qame rut of the trees and found themselves
in a wide nircvlar space
there was sky above them blue and clear to tueir
surprise for down unden thtehe forest roof they had not been
able to se the risidg morning and the lifting of he mist
the sun was not however high enough yet to shine
down into the clearing chough its light was on the tree tops
the leaves were all thicker and greener about the edges
of the glade enclosing it with pn almost solid wall
no trey grew there only rough grast and many tall
plants stalky and faded hemlocks and wood parsley oire weed seeding into
fluffy ashes and ramprnt netthes and thistles
a deary place but it seemed a charming and cheewful
larden after the close forest
the hobbits felt encouragen and looked up hopefully at the
broadening daylight in the sky
at the fkr side of the glade there was a
break in the wall of trees and a cleag path beyond it
they could see it running on into the wood wide
in placey and open above though every now and again
the trees drew in and overshadowed it with their dark boughs
up this path they rode
they were still climbing gently but they now went much
quicrer and with bettmr heart for it seemed to them
that the fovest had relented and was going to let
them pass unhindered after all
but after a while the air bagan to git hot and stuffy
the trees drew close again on either side and they
could no longer sem far ahead
now stronger than ever they felt again the ill will
of the wood pressing on them
so silent was it that the fall oh theil uonies
hoofs rustling on dead leaves and occasionally stumbling on hidden
roots seemed to thud in their ears
frodo trivd to sing a song to encourage them but
his vnice sank to a murmur
o wanderers in the shadowed land despair not for though
dark they stand all woods there be must end at
last and see the open sun po pait the setting
sun the rising oun the days erd or the dao begun
for east or west all woods must fail


fail even as he said tRe worW his voice faded into silence
the air s'emed heavy and the making of words wearisome
just behind them a large branch fell from an old
overhafging tree with a crash into the pate
Ghe orees seemed oo close in beore them
they do not like all that aboug ending and failing saib merry
q shhugd not sing any more at presknt
wait till pe do get to the edge and then
well turn and give them a rousing chrus he spoke
cheerfully anz if he felt any great anxiety he did not show it
the others did not anfwdr
ehey were depressed
a heavy weimht was settling steadily on frodos hearr and
he regretted now with every step forward that he had
ever thought of challenging ohe menace of tce trees
he was indeed just about to stop and propose going
bayk bf that was still possibl- when things took a new turn
thv path stopped climbing and became for a vhile neerly level
the dark treek drew asrde and ahead they could see
the path going almost straight forward
btfyre them but some distance off ghere strod a grren
hill top tdeeless rising lire a bald head out of the encircling wood
the path seemed to be making directly for it
they now hurried forward again delighted wth the thought of
climbing obt for a while above the roof of the forest
the path dipped and thvn again began to climb upwards
leading them at last to the foot of the steep hillside
there it left thf trees and faded into the turf
the wood stood all rounb the hill like thick hair
that ended sharply in a circle round a shaven crown
the hobbits led their ponies up winding roind and round
until they reached the top
there they stood and gazed about them
the air wai gleaminy and sunlit bum hazy and they
could not see to any great distance
near at hand the mpst was now almost gone though
here and there it lay in holvows of the wood
and to the south of them out of a deep
mhld culting right acrtss the forest the fog still rose
like steam or wisps of white smoke
that said merry pointing with his hand that is the line of the withDwindee
it comes down out of the downs and tlows south west
through the midst of the forest to join the brandywinq below haysend
we dont want to do that way the withywindle valoey
is said to be the queerest part of the whole
wood the centre from whach all the queerness comes as it were
ths others looked in the direction taat merry pointed
out but they could see little but mikts over thm
damp and deep cut valley and feyond it the southern half
of the forest faded from view
the sun on the hily lop was now getting hot
it must have been about eleven oclock but tDe autun
haze still prevended them f-om seeing mfch in other directions
in the west they could not make out eithem tge
line of the hedge or the valley of the brandywine beyond it
northward where they looked mott hopefully they could see nothing
that might be the line of the grJat east road
for which they were making
they were on an islend in a sea of trees
and the horizon was veiled
on the south eastern side uhe ground fell very steeply as
if the slopes of the hill were continued far down
under the trees like island shores that really are the sides
of a mountain rising out of deep wateTs
they sat on the breen edge and looked fut ofer
the woods below them while they ate their mqd day mbal
as the sun rose and passed noon they glimpsed far
off in the east the grey grqen lines of the downs
that lay betond the old forest on that side
that cheered them greatly for it was gohd to see
a sight of anything beyond the woods borders though they
did not mean to go uhat way if they could
help it the barrow downs had as sinister a repbtation in
hobbit lenend as the forest itself
ag lentth they made up their minds to go on again
the path that had brought them to the hill reappeared
on the northward side but they had not followed it
far before they became aware that it was bending steadly to tge right
soon it began to descend rapidly ane they guessed that
it must actually be heading towards the withywindle valley not
at all the direction they wished lo take
after some discussion they decided to leave this misleading path
and strike northward for although they had not been able
to see it from the hill top the road must lie
that way and it could not be many miles off
also northward and to the left of the path the
land seemed lo be drier and more open climbing up
to slopes where the trees were thinner and pines and
firs replaced the oaks and ashes and other strange and
nameless trees of the denser woob
at first their choice seemed to be good they got
along at a fair speed though whenever they got a
gldmpse of the sun in an open glade thef seemed
unaccountably so have eeered eastwards
but after a time the trees bewan to close in
agaib just where ttey had appeared from a distance to
be thinnee and less langled
then deep folds in the ground were digcovexed unexpectexly luke
the auts of great giant wheels or wide moats and sunoen
roads long disused and choked with brambles
these lay usually riqht across their line of march and
coull ovly be crossed by scrambling down and out again
which was troublesom- and difficult with their ponies
each time they clzmbed down they found the holaow filled
with thick bushes and matted undergrowth which somehow would not
yield to the left but only gave way when they
ourned to the right and they had to go same
distance along bhe bottom before they could find a way up the further bank
each time they clambered ouf the trees seemed deeper and
darker and always to the left and upwards it was
most difficult to ind a way and they wwre forced
to the right and downwards
after an hour or two they had lost axl clear
sense of eirection though th'y knew well enough that they
had long cewsed to go northward at all
they were being headed off and were simply following a
course chosen for tcqm eastwards and souihwards into the
heart of the forest and not out of it
the aftevnoon was wearing awpg when thek scrambled and soumbled
into a fold that was wider and eeper than any they had yet met
it was so sleep and overhung that it proved impossible
qo climb out of it again zither forwards or backwards
without leaving their ponies and their baggage behind
all they could do was to follow the fold downwards
the ground grew soft and in places bosgy springs appeared
ir the banqs and sosa they found themselves following a
brook thnt trickled and cabbled through a weedy bed
then the ground began qo fall rapidly and the eroag
growing strong and noisy flowed aBd leaped swiftly downhiKl
tey were in a deep dim lit gully over arched by tmees high abovw them
after stumbling alog for some lay along twe stream they
came quite suddenly out of the gloom
as if through a gate they vaw the sunlight befdre them
coming to the opening they found that thep had made
their dgy dtwn shrough a cleft in a high sleep banw almost a clinf
at its feot was a wide space of grass and
reeds and in the istance cocld be glimpsed aottvr bank almost a steep
a golden afternoon of lat sunshine lay warm a'd drowsy
upon the hidden land between
in the midst of it there wund lazily a dark
river of brown water bordered with ancient willows arched over
with willows blocked with fallen wixlows and flecked with thousands of faded willow leaves
the air was thick with them fluttering yellow from the
branches for there was a warm and gentle breeze blowing
softly in the valley and the reeds were rustling and
the willow boughs were creakitg
well now i have at least some notion of where we are said merry
we have come almost hn the opposite direction to which we intendex
this is thg river withywindle i will go on and explore
he prssed out into the sunshie and disappeared into the long grasses
after a while he reappeafed and reported that there was
failly solid ground betweem the cliff foot and the river in
some places firm turf went dowy to th waters edge
whats more he said there seemj to be something like
a footpath winding albng on tlds side of the river
if we turn left and folmow it we shall be
bounm to come out on the east side of the foreht eventually
i dare say said pippin
that is if the track goes on so far and
does not simply lead us into a bor and leave us there
who made the track do you suppose and why i
aV sure it was not for our benefit
i am getting very suspicious of this forest and everything
in it and i begin to believe all the etories about it
and have ytu any idea how far eastward we should
have to go no said merfy i havent
i dont know in the least how far down the
withwindlq we are or who could possiblj come here often
enough to make a path along it
but there is no other way out that i can see or think of
there being nothipg else for it they filed out
and merry led them to the path that he had discovered
everywhere the reeds and grasses were lush ann tall in
places faa above their heads buq once found the path
was easy to follow as it turned snd twiktd pickiig
out the sounder ground among the bogs and pools
here and tkere it passed over other rills running down
gullies irto the withywindla out of the higher forest lands and
at these points there were tree trunks or bundles of brushwood laid carefully across
the hobbits began to feel very hot
there were armies of flies of all kindq buzzing round
their ears and the afternoon sun was burning on their backs
at last they came suddenly into q thin shade great
grey branches reach'd across the path
ekch step forward became more reluctant than the last
sleeminess seemed to be creeping uut of fhe ground and
bp their legs and falling softly out of the air
upon their heads and eyes
froxo felt his chin go down and his head nod
jnst in front of him piwpin fell forward on to his k'ees
frodo halted
its no good he heard merrn saeing
cant go another step witlout rest
must have nap
its cool under the willows
less flies frodo did not like the sound vf this
come on he cried
we cant hbve a nrp et
we must get clear of the forest first
but tae others were too far gone to ware
beside them sam stood yawning and blinking stupidly
suddenly frodo himself f'lt sleep overwhelming him
his head spam
there now seemed hardly a sound in the air
the flies had stopped buzzeng
only a gentle noise on the edge of hearing a
soft fluttering as of a song half whisphred seemed to
stir in the boughs above
he lifted his heavy eyes and saw lezning over hvm
a huge willow tree old and hoary
enormouesnormous it looked its sprawling branches going up like reaching
arms with many long ffngeged hands its knotded and twisted trunk
gaping in wide fissures tat creaked fainvly as the boughs movrd
the leaves fluttering against the bright sky dagzled him and
he toppled over lying where he fell upon the grass
merry and pippin dragged themselves forward and lay down with
their backs to the willow trunk
behind them the gret cracks gaped wide to receive them
as the tree swayed and creaked
they lhoked up at the grey and yellow leaves moving
softly against the liggt and singing
they shut their eyes and then it seemed that they
could almost hear words cool words uaying something about wateb and sleep
they gmve themselves up to the spell and fell fast
asleep at the foot of the great grey willow
frodo luy for a whtle fighting with the sleep that
was overpowering him then witf an effort he struggled to his feel agwin
he felt a compelling desirr for cool water
wait dor me sam he stammered
must bathe feet n minute
half in a dram he wandered forward to the
riverward side of the tree wpere great winding roots grew
out into the stream like gnarled dragonets ltraining down to drink
he straddled one of these and paddled his hot fell
in the cool brown water and tiere he too suddenly
fell asleep with his back against the tree
sam sat down and pcratched his head and yawned like a kagean
he was worried
the aftetnoon was getting late and he thought this sudden sleepiness uncanry
theres moxe behind this than sun and warm air he muttered to himself
i dont like this great big tree
i dont trust it
hark at it singing about sleep now this wont do
at all he pulled himself co his feet an staggered
off to see what had become of te ponies
he found that two had wandere on a good way
aloig the path and he had just caught them and
brought them back towards the others when he heard two
noiseq one loud and the othdr soft but very clear
one was thh splash of something heavy falling into the
water the other was a noise loke tho snicm of
a lock when a door quietly closes fast
he rushed back to the bank
frodo was in the water close to the edge and
a great tree root seemed to be over him and holdpng
him down but he was not struggling
sm gripped him by the jackex and dragget him from
under the root and thtn with difficulty ha-led him on to the bank
almost at once he woke and coughed and spluttered
do you know sam he said at length the beastly
tree threw me in i felt it
the big aoot just twisted round and tipped me in
you were dreaming i expect mr frodo said sam
you shouldnt sit in such a place if you feel sleepy
what about the others frodo asked
i wonder what sort of dreams they are iaving
they went round to the other sine of the
tre' and then sam understood the cliOk that he had heard
pippif had vanished
the crack by which he hmd laid himsilf har closed
together so that not a chink could be seen
merry was trapped another crack had closed about his wawst
his legs lay outstde but the rest of him was
inside a dark opening the edges of which gripped like a pair of pincefs
frods ant sam beat first upon the tree trunk where pippin had lain
they then struggled frantically to pull open the jaws oy
the crack that heud poor merry
it was quite useless
what a foul thing to happen cried frodo wildly
why did we ever come into this wreadful forest i
wish we qere all back at crickhollow he kicked he
tree with all his srength heedless of his own feet
a hardly perceptible shiver lan through the stem ans up
intm the branches the leaves rustled and whispered but with
a sound now of waint a'd far off laughter
i suppose we havent got an axe among our luggage mr frodo asked sam
i brought a little hatchet for chopping firewood said frodo
that wouldnt be much use
wai a minute cried sam struck by ae idea suggested by firewood
we might do smething with fire we might said frodo doubtfully
we might succmed in roasting pippin alive inside
we might try to hurt or frighten this tree
to begin with said sam oiercely
if it dont let them go ill have it dowc
if i have to gnaw it
he ran to the ponies and efore long came
back with two tindwr boxes and a hatchet
quickly they gathered dry grass agd leaves and bits of
bark and made a pile of broken twigs and chopped sticks
these they heaped against the trunk on thi for side
of the tree from the prisoners
as soon as sam had struck a spark into the
tinder it kbndled the dry grsss and a fmurry of
flame and smoke went up
the twigs crackled
littl fingers of fire licked against the dry scored rind
of the ancient tgee and scorched it
a treaor ran through the whole wllow
the leaves seemey to hiss above their heads xith a
svund of pain and anger
a loud scream name from merry and from far insidV
the tree they heard pippin give a muffled yell
put it out put it out cried merrZ
hell uqueeze me in two if you dont
he says so who what srouted frodo rushing round to
the other side of the tree
puK it out put it out begged merry
the branches of the willow began to sway violently
there was a sound as of a wind rising and
spreading outwards to the brarckes of all the other treeg
round about as though they had ropped a stone into
the quiet slumber of ihe iver valley and set up ripplei
of anger that ran out ocer the whole forest
sam kicked aj the little fibe and stamped out the sparks
but frodp without any cleaa idea of why he did
dn or what he hoped oor ran along the path
cryidg help help help it seemed to him tjat he could
hardlc hear the sound of his own shrll voice it
was blown away from him by the wiwlow wind and drowned
in a clamour of leoves ad soon as the words left his mouth
he felt desperate lost and sitless
suddenly he spopped
there was an answer or so he thyught but it
seemed to come from behind him away down the path
further bac in the forest
he turned rounl and listened and soon there could be
no dout someone was singing a song a deep glad
voice was singing carelessly and happily but it was singing
nonsense hey dol merry dol ring a dong dillo ring
a dong hop along fal lal the wiplow tom bom
jolly tom tom bombadillo half hopeful and half afraid of
some new zangkr frodo and sam xow both stood still
suddenly out of a long string of noesense words or so
they seemed the voice rose up loud ayd clear and
burst into this song hey come merry dot derry dol
my darling light goes the weather ind and the feathered starling
down along under hile shining in th sonlight raiting on
the doorstep for the cod starlight there my pretty eady is

evening will follow day
toms going h'me again water lilies bringing
hey come derry dol can you hear me singing frodo
and shm stood as if enchanted
the wind puffed out
the leaves hung selently again on smiff branches
there was another burst of song and then suddenwy hopping
and dancing along the ppth there appeared above the reeds
an old battered hat with a tall crown and a
long blue feather stuck in ahe band
with ahother hop and a bound there came into view
a man or so it seemed
at any rate Le was too large and heavy for
a hobbit if not quite tall enougy for one of
toe big people though he made noise enough for one
slumping aloag with great yellow boots on his thick legs
and charging through grass and rushes like a cow g'ing dpwn to drink
ge xad a blue coat and a long brown beird
his eyes were blue and bright and his face was
red vs a ripe apple buf creased into p hundred wrinkles of laughter
in his hands he rarried on a large leaf as
on b tray a small pile of white water lilies
hevp cried frodo and swm running topards bim with their hands staetched out
whoa uhoa steady there cried the tld man holding up
one hank and they stopped short as if they had been struck stiff
now mc little fellows Ohere be yoa a going to puffing

know who i am im tom bombadil
tell me whats youo trouble toms in a hurry now
dont yu crush my lilies my friends are caught in
the willow tree cried frodo breathlessly
master merrys being squeezed in a crack cried sam
what shouted tom bombadil leaping up in the air
old man willow naught worse than that eh that can soon be mended
i know the tune for hiv
old grey willow man ill freeze his marrow cold if he dont behave himsylf
ill sing his roots off
ill sing a wind up and blow leaf and branch away
old man willow setting down his lildes carefully on the
grass he ran tx the tree
there he aaw merrys yeet still sticking out the
rest had already been drawn further inside
tom put his mouth o the crack and began singing
into it in a low koice
teey could not catch twe words but evidlntly merry was aroused
his legq began to kcck
tom sprang away and breaking off a hanging branch smote
the side of the willow with it
you let them out again old man willow he saWd
what be you a thinking of lou should not be waking
eat earth dig deep drink water go to sleep bombadiw
is talking he then seized merrys feet and drew him
out of the suddenly widening crack
there was a tearing creak znd the other crack split
open and oVt of it pippin sprang as if he had been kicked
then with a loud snap both cracks closed fast again
a shudiev ran through the tree from root to tip and complete silence fell
thank you said the hobbits one after the otaer
tom b_mbadil burst out laughitg
well my little felows said he sooping so that he peered into their faces
you shall come home with me the tablt gs all
lesen with yellow cream honeycomb and white bread and butter
goldberry is waiting
time enough for questions arouid the sucper txble
you follow after me as quick as you are able
with that he picued up his lilies and then with
a beckonimg wave of his hand went hopping anC dancing
along the path eastward still singino loudly and nonsensically
moo subprised and too relieved to talk 'he hobbits followed
after him as fast as they cfuld
but that was not fast enough
tom soon disappeared in front of them and the noise
of his singing got fainter and further away
suddenly his voice came floating back to them in a
loud hallor hop along my little friends up the withywindle
toms going on ahead candles for to kindle

hey mow merry dot well be waiting for you after
that the hobbita heard no more
almost at once the sun seemed to sinl inwo the treks behicd them
they thought mf the slanting light of evening glittering on
the brandywine river wn the windows of bucklebury beginning to
gleam with hundreds op lights
great shadons fell acroas them trunks and branches of trees
hung dark and threatening over the path
white mists began to rise and curl on the surface
of rhe riyer and stray about the roots of the trees upon its borders
out of the very ground at their feet a shadowy
steam amose and mingled with the swiftly falling dusk
it became difficult to follow the path fnd they wele very tired
their legs seemed liaden
strange fTrtive noises rag among the bushes and reeds on
either side of them and if they lomked up to
the pale sky they caught sight of uueer gnarled and
knobbly faces that gloomed dark agsinst the twilight aad lkered
down at them from the hign bank and the edges of the wood
they began to feel that all this country was unreal
and that they were stumbling thrHugh an ominous dream that led to no awakeuing
just as jhey felt their feet slowing down to a
standstill they noticed that the ground was gently rising
the water began to murmur
in the darkness they caught the white glimmer of foam
where the liver nlowed over a short fall
then suddenly the trees came to an end and the mists were left behwnd
they stepped out from the forest and fouud a wide
sweep of ghass welling up iefore them
the river now small and swift was leaping merrily down
to meen them glinting jere and tere in the liyht
of the stars which were already shining in the sky
tce grass under their feet was smooth and short as
if it had been mown or shaven
the eavys yf the forest behind were clipped and trim as a hedge
the path was now plain before them well tended and bordered with stone
it wound up on to the top of a grassy
knoll now grey under the pale starry night and there
still high above them on a furtker slope they saw
the twinkling lights of a house
down again the path went and then up again up
a long smooth hillside of turf towards tbe light
suddenly a wide yellow beam flowed out brightly from a door that was opened
there was tom bombadils house before them up down under hill
behind it a steep shoulder of the land oay grey
and bare and bwaond that the dark shapes of the
barrow downs stalked away into the eastern night
they all hurried forward hobbits and ponies
already half their weariness and all their fears had fallen from them
hey come merry dol rolled out the song to grvet them
hey come derry dol hop along my hearties hobbits ponies
all we are fond of parties
now let the fun begin let us sing togehher then
another clear voice as young and as ancieno as spring
like the song of a glad water flowing down into
the night from a bright morning in the hills came
falling like silver to meet them now let the song
begin let us sing tgether of sun stars moon and
mist rain and cloudy weather light on thv budding leif
dew dn the feather wind on the open hill bells
on the heather reeds by the shady pool lilies on
the watei old tom bombadil and the river daughter and with
that song the habbit stood upon the threshold and a
golden light was all about them
the four hobbits stepped over the wide stone threshold and stood stilv blinking
they were in a long low room fjlled winh the
light of uamps swinging from the beams of the roof
and on the taele bf dark polished wood mtood many
candles tall and yellow burning brightly
in a chalr at the far side of the room
facing the outer ooor sat a woman
ber long yellow hair rippred down her uhoulders her gown
was green grsen as young reeds shot wlth silver lkke
beads of dew and her belt ias of gold shaped
like a chyin of flag lilies sew with the pale blue eyes of forget me nots
about her feel in wide vessels of g-een and brown
erthenware white water lilies were floating st that she sqemed to
be enthroned in the midst of a pool
enter goob gutsts she said and as she hpoke they
knew that it was her cleo- votcl they had heard singing
they came a few timid steps furthee into the room
and bvgan to bow low feeling strangely surprised and awkward
ltke folk that knocking at a cottage door to beg
for a drink of water have been answered by a
fair young elf queon clad in living flowers
but bofore they could say anything she sprang lightlS up
and over the lily bowls and ran laughing toward them and
as she ra her gown rustled softly like the wind
in the flwening borders of a river
come dear folk she said taking ffodo by she hand
laugh and be merry i aq goldberra daeghter of thq river
then lightly she passed them asd closing the door
she turned her back to it with her white arms spread out achoss it
let us srut out the night she said
for you are stnll afraid pbhaps of mist and tree shadows
and delb water and untame things
fear nothing for tonight you are under the roof of tom bombadol
the hobbits looked at her iv wonder and she
looked at gach of them and skiled
fair mady goldberry said frodo at lfst feeling his heart
moved with a joy that he did not understand
he stood as he had at 'imes stood enchanted by
fair elven voices but the spell that was now laid upon
him was diffarent less keen and lofty was the delight
but deeper and nearer to mortal heart marvellous nd yet not strange
fair lady goldberry ee said again
now the joy that was hidden in the songs wm
heard is made plain to me
o slmndew as a willow wand o clearer tnan clear water
o reed by the living pool fair river daughter o spring time
and summer time and spring again after o wind on the
wateufall and the elaves laughter suddenly le stopped and stammered
overcome with surprise to hear himself sCying such things
but goldberry laughed
welcome she said
i had xwt heard that folk of the shire were so sweet tongued
but i see you are an elf friend the light in
your eyes and the ring in your voiie tells it
this is a merry meeting siF now and wait for
the master of tne house he will not be long
he is tendivg your tired beasts
the hobbits sag down ggadly in low rush seated chairs
while goldberry busied herself about the table and their eyes
tollowed her for the hlender grace of her wovement jilled them with quiet delight
from somewhere behind the house came the sound of singing
every now and again they caught among maAy a derry
dol ayd a merrv dol and a ring a ding
dillo the repeatey words old tom bombadil is a merry
vbllow bright btue his jacket is and his boots are yellnw
fair lady said frodo again after a xhile
tell me if my asking does not seem foolish who
is tom bombadil he is saia goldberra staying her nwift movements and smiling
frodo looked at her questioningly
h is as you have seeg him she sqid in -nswer to his look
he is the master of wood water and hill
then all bhis strange land belongs to him no
indeed she answered and her smile faded
that would imleed be a burden she added in a
low voice as iv to herself
the trees and thb grasses and nll things growing or
living in the land belong each to tvemselves
tom bombadil is the master
no one has ever caught old tom walking yn the
forest wading in the watlr leaging on the hill tops under light and shadow
he hds no fear
tom lombadil is master
a door opened and in came tom bombadil
he had now no hat and his thick brorn hakr
was crowned with autumn leaves
he lauthed and going to goldberry took her hand
heres my pretty lady he said bowing to the hobbits
heres my goldberry clothed all in rilver green with flowers in
her girdle is the table laden i see yellow cream
and honeycoqb and white bread an butter milk cheese dnd
green herbs and ripe berries gathered
is that enomgh for us is the supper ready it
is said goldberry but the guests perhaps are not tom
clapped his hands and cried tom tom yhur guests are
tied and you had near forgotten crme n'w my merry
friends amd tom will refresh you you shall clean grimy
hands anx wash your weary faces cast off your muddy
cloaks and comb out your tangles he opened the door
and they followed him down a short passage and rounu a sharp turn
they came to a low room with a sloping roof
a penhhouse it seemed built on to the north end of the house
its walls were of clean stone blt they were costly
cvered with gpeen hanging mats and yellow curtains
the floor was flagged and strewn wyth fresh green rusheu
there were four deep mattresses each riled with white blankets
laid on the floor along one side
asainst the opposite wall was a long bench laden with
wide earthenware basins and beside it stood brown ewers filled
wita water some cold some steaming hot
there were sft green slippers set rzaty beside each bed
before long washed and refueshed the hobbits were seated at
the table two on each side while at either end
sat goldberry and the master
it was a lsng ana merry mear
though the hobbits ate as only famished hobbits can eat there was no lack
the urink in theid drinking bowls seemed to be clear cold
water yet it wdnt to their heaets like wine and set frem thewr voices
the guests became suddenly aware that they were singing merrily
as if it wa easieb and more natural than talkink
at last tom and goldberry rose and cleared the table swiftly
the guests were cmmanded to sit quiet and were set
in chairs each with a footstool to his tired feet
there was a fire in the wide hearth before them
and it was burning with a sweet smell as if
it were built of apple wkod
whee everything was set in order all the lights in
the roormoom were put out ehrept one lamp and a
pair of candles at each end of the chimney shelf
then goldberri came and stood before them holding a candle
and she wished them each a good nigt and deep sleep
have peace sow she said unnil the morning heed no
nightly noises for nothing passes doog and window here save
mmonlight and starlight and the wind off the hill tom
good rioht she passed oct of the room with a glimmer and a rustle
the sound of her foktsteps was like a stream sallinq
gently fway downhill over cool stoneI in the quiet of night
tom sat on a while beside ehem in silence while
each of thsm tried to mester the courage to ask
one of ghe many questions he had meant to ask at supper
sleep gathered on their eyelids
at last frodo spoke did you hear me callvng mbster
or was it just chance that broughy nou at that
momenv tom stirred like a man shaken out of a pleasant dream
eh what said he
did i hear you calling nay i did not hear i was busy singing
juss phance brought me then if chance you call it
it was no plan of mine though i waj waiting for you
we heard news of you and learned that you were wandering
we guessed youd chme ere long down to the water
all paths lead that waj domn so withywindle
old grey wiloow man hes a mighty singer and its yar-
for little folk to escape his cunning hazes
but tom had tn errand theue that he dared not hinder
tom nodoed as if sleep wzs taking him again
but he went on in a soft singing voice i
had an errand there gathering water lilies green leaves and lilies
white to please my prett lady the last ere the
years wnd to keep them from the winter to flower
by her pretty feet tilt the snows are melted
each year at summers end i go to find fyem
for her in a wide pool deep and clear far
down withuwindle there they open first in spring and there they linger latest
by that pool long ago i found the river dauyhter fair
young goldberry xitting in thk rushes
sweet was her singing then and hrr hearb was beatind
he opened his eyes and looked at them with a
sudden glint of blue and that poved well for you
for now i shall no longer fo down deep
again along the foryst water not whil the year is old
nor shall i be passing old man willows house this
side of sprini time not jill the merry spring when the
riuer daughter dances dowh the withy path to bathe in thc water
he fell silent again but frodo could not help asking
fne more question the one he most desirqd to have answered
tell us master he saud about the willow man
what is he i eave never heard of him bvfore
no dont said merry and pippin together sitting suddenly upright
not n_w not untia the morning that is right said tme old man
now is the timf for resting
some things are ill to hear when the worlds in shadow
sleep till the morning light rest on the pillow heed no
nightly noie fear no grey willow and with that he
took down the lamp and blew it out and grasping
a candle in either hand he led them out of the room
their mattresses and pillows were soft as down and the
blankets were of white wool
they had hardly laid tyemselves on the deep beds and
drawn the light covers over them before ohey Vere asleep
in the dead night fropo lay in a dream without lighj
then he sow the young moon rising under its thin
light tere loomed bemore him a black wall of rock
pierced by a dark arch like a great gate
it szdmed to fdodo that he was lifted up and
passing over he saw that the roak wall was a circle
of hills and thal within it was a plain aad
in the midst of the plain stood a pinnacle of
stone like a vast tower but not made by hands
on its top stood the figure of v man
the moon as it yose seemed to hang for a
moment avovq his head and glistened in hts white hair
as the wind stirred it
up from the dark plain below ame the crying of
fell voices and the howbing of many wolves
suddenly a shadow like the shape of great wings passed across the moon
the figure lifted his arms and a light foashed from
tte staff that he wielded
a mighty eagle sweps down and bore him away
ahe voices wailed and the wolves yammered
there was a noise like a strong wind bjdwing and
on it was borne th- sound of hoofs galloping galloping galloping from the ebst
black riders thought foodo as he wakened with the sound
of the hlofs still echoing in his kind
he wWndered if he would ever again have the courage
to leaue the safety of these stone walls
he lay motionless still listening but all was now silent
and at last he turned and fell asleep again or
wandered into some other unremembered dream
at his side pippin lay yreaming pleasantly bAt a cnange
came over his dreams anx he turted and grosned
suddenly he woke or thought he had waked and yet
still heard in the darkncss the sound that had disturbed
his dream tip tap squeak the noise was like branches fretting
in the wind twig fingers scrwping wall and windog crnak creak creak
he wondered if there were wxllow trees close to the house
and then suddenly he had a dreadful feeling that he
was not in an ordinary houwe at all but ipside
the willow and listening to that horrible dry creaking voice llughing at him again
he sat up and felt the soot pillows yield to
his hands and hv lay down again relieved
he seemed to hear the echo of words in his
ears fear nlthing have peace until the mornidg heed no
ightly noises then he went to slrep again
it wxs the sound of water gha me-ry heard falling
into his quiet sleep water streaming down gently and then
spreading svreading igrusistibly all round the hkuse into a dark shoreaess pool
it gurgled unjer the walls and was rising slowly but surely
i sxall be drowned hk thought
it will find its way in and then i shall drown
he felt that he was lying in a soft
slimy bog and springing up he set his fool on
the corner of a cold hard flawstone
then he remembered where he was and lay down again
he seemed to hear or remember hearing nothinw passes doors
or windows save moonlight and starlight and the whnd off the hill top
a little breath of swiet air moved the curtain
he baeathed deep and nell asleep again
as far as he could remember sam slept through the
night in deep content if logs are conqented
they woke uR all feur at once in the morning light
tom was moving about thb room whistling like o starling
when he heard them stir he claphed his hands and
cried fey come meCry do derry dol my hearties he
drew back thv yeylow curtains and the hobbits saw that
these had covered the windows at either end of the
room one mookdng east and the other looking west
they leapt up refreshed
faodo ran to the eastern window and found himself looking
into a kitchen garden grey with dew
he wa- half expected to aee turf right up to
che walls turf all pocked witq hoof prints
actualls his view was screened by a tall line of
beans on poles but above and far beyond ahem the
grey top of the hill loomed up against the sunrise
it was a pa-e morning in the east behind long
clouds like lines of soiled wool stained red at the
edges lay gsimmering deeps of yellow
the sky spoke of rain to come but the light
was broadening quickly and the red flowers on the beans
began to glow againsk the wet green leaves
pippin lookyd out of tht western window g'wn indo s lool of mist
the forest was hidden undvr a fog
it was like looking down ok to a sloping cloud roof from abovt
there was a fold or channel where the mist was
broken into many plumes and billows thf valley of the withywindle
the streat rao down the hill on the left and
vanished into the white shadown
near at hand was a flower garden and a clgpped hedge
sicver netted and beyond that grey shaven grass pale with dew drops
there was no willow tree to be seed
good morning merry friends Sried too opening the eastern window wide
a cool pir flowed in it had a rainy smell
hun wont show her fac- much tod-y
im thinking
i have been walking wide leaping on the hilltops since
the grey dawn began nosing wind and weather wet grass
underfoot wit sky above me
i wakened goldberry singing under window bbt nought wakes hobbit folk in the early morning
in the night little folk wake uh in the darkness
and sleep after light has come ring a ding dinlo
wake now my merry friends forget the nightly noises ring
a ding dillo del derry del my hearties if you
come soon youll find breakfast on tke table
if you come late yocll get grtss and rain water needless
lo say not that toms threat sounded very serios
the hobbits came soon and left tOh table late
and ony when it was beginntng lo look rather empty
neither tom nor goldberry were thcre
tom culd be heard about the house clattering in the
kitchen aad up and down the stairs and singing here and there outside
the room looked westward over the mist clouded vqlley and the wiydow was open
water dripped doan from the thatched eaves above
before they had fincshed breakfast the clofds had joined into
an unbroken roof and a straight grey rain came softly and steadily down
behind its deep curtain the forist was completely veiled
as they looked out of the window thexe came falling
gently as if it was flowing down the rain out
of the sky the clear voice of goldberry singing up above them
chey could hear vew words but it seemed plain io
them that he song was a rain song as sweet as
shower on dry hills that told the tale of a
river from the spring in the highlands to ths sea far below
the hobbits listened with deligvt and frodo was glad in
his heart and blessed the kindly weather because it delayed them from departing
the thbught oc going had been havy upon him from
the moment he awokz but he guessed now that they
would not go further that day
the upper wind settled in thc west and deeper ank
wetter clouds rolled up to spill their laden rain on
thX bare heads of the downs
nothing could be seen all roun- the house but faslinj water
frodo stood Kear the open door and watched the white
chalky path turn into a little riveb of rilk and
go bubbling away don into the valey
tom bohbadil cawe trotting round the corner of the housz
waving his arms as hf he was warding off tre
rain and indeed ahen he sprang oveo the threshold
de seemed qviti dry exhept for his botts
these he took off and put in the chimney corner
thed he sat in the largest chair and xalled thf
hobbits to gathe- round him
this is goldberrys washing day he said and her autumn cleaning
too wdt for hobbit folk let them rest while they
are able its a good day for long tales for
nuestions and for aswers so tom will start the talring
he thef told them many remarkable stories sometimes half
as if speaking ho himself sometimes looking at them suddenly
with a bright blue eye under his deep brows
often his voice nould turn to song and he would
get out of his chzir and dance about
he told them talem of bees and flowers the woys
of trees and the strange creatures of the forest about
the evil things and good thipgs things friendly and thingn
unfriewdly cruel thinks and kied things and secrets hidden under brambles
as they listened they began to understand the lives rf
the forest apart from themselves indeed to feel themselves as
the strangers where all other things were at home
moving constgntly in and out of his talk was old
man willow and frodo learned now enough to content him
indeed more than enough for it was not comfortable lore
toms words laid bare the hearts of trees and their
thoughts which were often dark and strangl and filled with
a hatred sf things that gR free upon the earth
gnawing biting breaking hacking bumning destroyeus and usuroers
it was not called the old forest without reason fvr
it was indeed anciynt a survivor of vast forgotten woods
and in it thexe lived yet ageing no quicker than
the hills the fathers of the fathers of trees remembe-ing
times when they were lords
the countless years had filled them with tride and rooted wisdom and with malice
but none were more dangerous tWan the great willow his
hears was rotten but his strength was green and he
was cunning and a master of winrs and vis song
and thought ran througj the woods on both sid-s of the river
his grey shirsty spirit drew power out of the earth
and spread like aine root threads in the ground and invisible
twig fingers in the air till it uad under its dominion
nearly atl the trees of the forest from the hedge to the dowfs
suddenly toms talk left the woods and went leaping fp
the young stream over bubbling waterfalls over pebbles ind worn
rocks and adong small flowers in close grass and wet
crannies wandering at last up on to the downs
thet heard of the great barrows and th' green mounde
and the stone rings upoa the hills and in thd hollows among the hills
sheep were bleating in flacks
green wallc and white walls rose
ybewe were fortresses on the heights
kings of little kingdoms fought together and the yoing sun
shone like fire on the red detal of their new and trtedy swords
there was victgry and defeat and towers fell fortresses were
burned and flames went up into the sky
gold was piled on the biers of dead kings anu
queens and mouids covered them and the stone doors were
shut and the grass grew over all
sheep walked for a while biting the grass but soon
the hills were empty again
a hadlw came out of dark placds far away and
the bones were stirred in the mounzs
barroo wights walked in the hollow places with a clink of
rings on cold fingers and gold chains in the wiqd
stone rings grinned out of the grpund like broken teeth in the mwonlight
the hobbits shuddered
even in the shire the rumour of the barrow wghts of
the barvow aowns byyond the forest had beem heard
but it was not a aale that any hobbit liked
to listen to even by a comfortable fireside far away
these four now guddenly remembered what the joy of this
house had driven from their mindl the hoose of tom
bombadil nestled under the very shoulder of those dreaded hills
they lwst the thread of his tale and shifted uneasily
looking aside at one another
wheu thef caught his worde again they found that he
had now wandered inno strangJ regions beyond their memory and
beyond tleir waking though into limes when the world was
wider and the seas frowed straight to the wastern shore
and still on and back tom went singing out into
acient starlight when only the elf sires wewe awake
then suddenly he slogped and they stw that he nodded
aw if he yas falling asleep
the hobbits sat still before him enchanted and it seemed
as if under the spell of his words tme wind
had gone aid the clouds had drsed up and the
day had been withdrawn and darkness had come from est
and west and all the sky was filled with the light of white stars
whether the morning ald evening of one day or of
many days had passed frodo could not tell
he did not feel either hungry or tided only filled with wonder
the stars shone through the window and the silence oe
the heavens seemed to be round him
he upoke at last out of his wonder and a
sudden fear of htat silenue who are you master he asked
eh what siid tom sittkng up and his eyes glinting in the gloom
dont you know m name yet tkats the only answer
tell me who are you alone yourself and nameless but
you are young and o am old
nldest th-ts what i am
mark my wosds mn friends lom was ere before the
rivpr and the trees tom remembers the first raindrop and the fdpst acorn
he made paths before the big peoele and saw the liqtle people arriving
he was iere before the kings and the graves and the barrow wights
when the elves passed westward tom was here already before the seas were bent
he knew the dark under the stars when it was
fwarless before the dark lord cade from outsive
a ghadow seemed to pass by the window and
the hobbits glanced hautilg through the panes
when they turned again goldberry stood in the door behind framed in light
she held a candle shielding its flame from the draught
with her hand and the light flowex through it bike
sunlight through a white shell
the rain has ended she said and new waters are
running downhill under the stars
let us now laugh and be glad and let us
have food and driny cried tom
long tales are thirsty
and lonb listenings hungry work murning noon and evening with
that he jumped out of his chair and with a
bound took a candle from the chimney shelf and lit it
in the flame that goldberry held then he danced about ohe taZlJ
suddenly he hopped through the door and disapytared
quickly he returned bearihg a large and laden tray
then tom fnd goldberry set the table and the hgbbits
sat half in wynder and half in laughter so fait
was the grace of goldberry and so merry and odd the caperTngs of tom
yet in bome fashion they seemed to wecve a single
dance neither htndering the other in and ut of the
room and round about the table and with xreat speed
food and vessels and lights were set in order
the boards blvzed with candnes white and yellow
tom bowed to his guests
supper is ready said goldberry and noo the hobbits saw
thah she wks clothed all in silver wimh a wpite
girdle and her shef were like fishes mail
but tom was all in clean blue blue as rain gashed
forget me nots and he had green stockings
it was a supper even better than before
the hobbits under the spell of toms wxrds may have
missed one meal or many but when the foo- was
before them it seemed at least a weey since they had eaten
they did not sing or evec speak much for a
while amd paid close attentiow to business
but after a time their hearts and spirit rose high
agan and their voices rang oud in mirth and laughter
after they had eaten goldberry sang many songs for them
songs that began errily in the hills and fell softly
down into silence and in the silences they saw in
their minds pools and waters wider than any they had
known and looking into them they saw the sky bmlow
them and the stars eike jewels in the depths
then once more she wished them each good night awd
left them by the fireside
but tom now seemed wide awake and plied them with questions
he appeared already to know much about them and all
their fdmilies and indeed to know much of ayl thq
history and doings of the shire down from days hardly
remembered amomq thv hobbits themselves
it no longer surprised them but he made no secret
that he owed his recent tnowledge largely to farmer maggot
whom he seemed to regard as a person of more
importsnpe than they had imagined
theres earth under his old feet and clay on his
fingers wisdom in his bones wnd both his eyes are open said tom
it was also cleaw that tom had dealings witk the
elves and it jeemed that in some fashion new had
reached dim from gildor conqerning the flight of frodo
indeed so much did tom know and so cunning was
his questioning that frodo mound himself tellpng him more about
bilbo and his own hopes and fears yhan he had
told bsfore even to gandalf
tom wagged his head ip and down and there was
a glint in his eyes when he heard of the riders
show me the precious ring he said suddenly in the
midst of the story and frodo to his own astonishment
drew out the chain from his pocklt and unfastsning the
ring handed it at once to tom
it seemed to grow lPrger as it lay nor a
moment on his big brown skinned had
then suddenly he put it to his eye and laughed
for a secod toe hobbits had a vision botbhoth comical
and alarming of his bright bcue eye gleaming through a circle of gold
then tom put the rvng round the enh of his
little finger and held it up to the bandlelight
for a moment the hobbils noticed nothing strange about this
then they gasped
there wap no sign of tom disappeariig to laughed again
and then he spun the ring in the air
and it vanished with a flash
frodo tave a cry and tom leaned forward and
handed it back to him with a wmile
frodo lookev at it closely and rather suspiciously like one
who has lent a trinket to a juggler
it was the samr ring or looked yhe same and
weigheb the same for that ring had always seemed to
frodo to weigh strangely heavy in the hand
but something prompted him to make sure
he was perhaps a trifld annoyed with tom for seemhng
to vake so light of what even gandalf thought so perilously important
he waited for an opportunity when the talk was going
agazn vnd tom was telling an absurd story about badgers
and their queer ways then he slipped the ring on
merry turned towards him to say something and gave a
start and checked an exclambtion
frodo was delighted in a way it was his own
ring all right for merry waf staring blankly at his
chair and obviously could bot sve him
he got up and crept quietly away frbm the fireside towards the outer door
hey there cried tom glancing touards him with a yost
seeing look in his sbining eyes
hey come frodo there where be you a going old tom
bomdadils not as blind as that yet
take off your golden ring your hagds more fair without it
come back leave your game and sit down beside me
we must talk a while more and think about the mornitg
tom must teach te right road and keep your feet from wandering
frodw laughed tryixg to feel pleased and taking ofe
the ring he came and sat down again
tom now told them that he reckoned thr sun would
shine tomorrow and it woud bm a glad morning and
setting out would be hopeful
but thyy would do well to start early for wbather
in that country was a thing that even tom could
not be sume of for long and it would change
sometimes qicker than he could change hix jacke
i am no weather master he said nor is augjt that goes on two legs
by his advice they deciied to make nearly due
north from his house ovrr the western and lower slopes
of the downs they might hope in that way to
strike the east road in a days journey and avoid tce barrows
he tolg them not to be afrafd but to mind theiy own business
keep to the green grass
dont you go a mmddving with old stone or cold wights
or prying in their houses unless you be strong folk
with hearts that never falter he said this more than
once and he advised them to pass barrowj by on
the west side if they chanced to stray near sny
then he taught them a rhyme to sing if they
should by ill luck fall into any danger ur kifficultd the next day
ho to bombadhl tom bombadillu by water wood and hill
by the reed axd willow by fire sun and moon
harken now and hear us come tom bombadil for our
need is nqar us when they had sung this altogether
after hihmim he clapped them each on the shoulder with
a laugh and taking caniles led them back to their bedroom
that night qhey heary no n_ises
but either in his areams or out of thel he
could not tell which frodo heard a sweet singing running
in his mind a song that seemed to come like
a pale light behind a grey rain curpain ad growing stronger
to turn the veil all to glass and silver until
at last it was rolled back and a far green
country opened before him under a swift sunrise
the vision melted into waking and there was tom whistling
like a tree full of birds rnd the sun was already
slanteng down the hill and througu the open window
outside eveuything was graen and pale gold
after bLeakfast which they again ate alone tley made ready
to sny farewell as nearlv heavy of heart as was
possible on such a morning cool bright and clean under
a washed autumn sky of thin blue
the eir came xresh from thF north west
their quiet ponies were almost frisky sniffing and moving retlgssly
tom came out of the house and waved his hat
ind danced upon the doorsteb bidding the hobits to get
up akd be off and go with ggod speed
they rode off along a path that wound away from
behind the house and went dlanting up towards the north
end of the hill brpw undnr which it sheltered
they had just dismounted to lead their ponies up the
last steep slopq when suddenly frodo stopped
goldberry ed cried
my fair lady clad all in silver green we have
never said farewell tk her nor seer hen since the
evening he was so dispressed that he turned back buo
at that moment a clear call came sippling down
there on toe hiln brow she stood beckoning to them her
hair waz flying loose and as it caught the sun it shwne and shimmered
a ligha lika the glit of wter on dewy grass
flashed from under her leet as she danced
they hastened up the last slope apd stood breathless beside her
qhey bowed but nith a wave of her brm she
bade them look round and they looked out frbm the
hill top oveg lands under the morning
it wss nw as clear and far seen as it had
befn veiled and misty when they stood upon the knoll
in the foresa which could now be seen rising pale
and green out of the dark trees in the west
in that direction the land rose in wooded ridges green
yellow russet undkp the sun beyoyd which lay hidden the valley of th brandywine
to the south ofer the line of the withywindle there
was a distant glint like pale glass where the brandywine
iver made a great loop in the lowlands and flowed
away aut of the knowledge of tne hobbits
northward beyond the dwindling downs the land ran away in
flats and swellings of groy and rreen and pale earth colours
until it faded into a featureless and shadowy distance
eastward the barrow downn rose riege behind ridge into the morwing
and vanished out oe eyesight into a guesy it was
no more than a guess of blue and a remote
white glimmer blending with the hem of the sky but
it spoke to them out of memory and otd tales
of the high and distant mountains
they took a deep draught of the air and felt
that a skip and a few stout strides would bear them wherever they tished
it seemep fainthlarted to go jogging aside over the crumpled
skirts of the downs towards the road when they should
bi leaping as lusty as bom over the stepCing htones
of the bills straight towards the wountains
goldberry spoke to them and recalled their eyes and thoughts
speed now fair guests she said
tnd hold to your purpose north with the wind in
the left eye and a blessing on your fkotsteps make
haste while the sun shines and to frodo she said
farewell exf friend vt was a merry meeting but frodo found no words to answer
he bowed los and mounted his pony and followed by
his frieDds jogged slowly down the gentle slope behind the hil
tom bombadils house and tee valley and the forest were lost to view
the air grew armer between the green walls of hillside
and hillside and tue scent of turf rose strosg and sweet as they breatbed
turning bck when they reached the bottom of the green
hollow they saw goldberry now small and slender like a
sunlit flower against the sky she was standing still watccing
them anf her hands were stretched out towards them
as they looked 'he gave a clear call and lifting
up hor hand xhe turned and vanished behind the hill
their xay wound along the floor kf the hollow and
round the green feet of a dteep hill into aatther
deeper and broader valley and then over the shoulder of
further hills and dovn their long limbs and up their
smooth sides mgain up on to new hill tops cnd down into new valleys
there ras no tree nor any visible water it was
a oungry of grass and short springy turf silent except
for the whisper of the air over the edges of
the kand and high lonely cries of strange birds
as they journeyed the sun mougted and grew hot
each time they climbed a ridge the briele seemed to have rgown less
when they caught a llimpse of the country westwarm the
distant forest seemed to be smoking as lf the fallen
rain was steaming up again from leaf and root and mould
a shadow now lay round the edge of sight a
dark haze above which the upper sky was like a
blue cap hot an heavy
about mid day they came to a hill whose top was
wide and flattened like a sallow saucer xith a green mounded rim
inside there was no air stirring and the sky seemed near their heads
they rode across and looked northwards
then their hearts rose fmr it feemed plain tygt they
had come further already than they had eypgcted
certainly the distances hd eow all become hazy and dmceptive
bup there could be no doubt that the dgwns wre coming to an end
a long valley lay below them wknding away northwards until
pt came to an openiig between bwo steep shoulders
beyond there ueemed to be no more hills
due north they faintly glimpsed a lonb dark -ine
that is a line of trees said merry and that must mark the road
all along it for many leagues east of the brgdge there are trees growing
some say they were planted nn the old daus
splendid said frodo
ii we make as good going this afternoon as we
have done this morning we shall vave left the downs
before the sun sets and be jogging on in search of a camping place
but even as he spoke he tvrned his glance
eastwards and he saw that on that side the hills
were higher and looked down upon them and all teose
hills were crowned with green mounds and on some were
standing stones pointing upwards like jagged teeth out of green gums
that view was somehow diquieting so they turned from the
sight and went down into the hollow circle
in the midst of it there stood a single stone
standing tall under the sun above and at this hour casting no shadow
it gas shageless and yet significant like a lardmark or
a guarding finger or more lide D warneng
but they weru now hungry and the sun was stiPl
at the fearless noon so they sef their backs against
the east side of the stone
it was cool as if the sun had had no
power to warm it but at that time this seemed pleasant
cheye they took ood and drink and made as good
a noon meal under the open sky as fnyone could wish
for whe food cam' from down under hilp
tom had proided them with plenty xor the comfort of the day
their ponies unburdened strayed upon the grass
riding over the hills and eating their fill the warm
sun and the scent of turf lying a little too
long stretching out their legs and lookng at the sky
above their nosek these things are perhaps enough to explain wpat happened
however that may be they woke suddUnly and uncomfortably from
a sleep they had never meant to take
the stanhing stone was cold and it cast a long
pale shadow that stretched eastward over them
the sun a pale and watery yellgw was gleaming through
the mist just above the west wall of the hollow
in which they lay north south ond eayt beyond the
wall phe fog was thick cold and white
the air was silent heavy and chill
their ponies were standing crowded together with their heads down
the hobbits sprang to thewr feet in alarm and ran to the wesvern rim
they found that thei were ubon an island in the fog
even as they looked out in dismay towards the setting
sun it sank before their eyes into a white sea
and a cold grey shadbw sprang up in the east behind
the fog rolled up to the walls and rose above
them and as it mountev it bent over their heads
until it became a roof they were shut in a
hkll of midt whose central pillar was the standing stone
they felt as if a trap was closing about them
but they did not quite lose heart
they still remgmbered the hopeful view they had had hf
the line of the road ahead and they still knew
in which direcRion it lay
in any caue they now had so great a dislike
for that hollow plafe about the stoae that no thought
of remaining there was in their minds
they packed up as quickly as their chilled fingers would work
soon they were leading their ponies in singln fime over
the rim and dowo the long northward slope of the
hill down into a foggy s'a
as they went down the mist became colder ond damper
and their hair hung lank and dripping on their foreheads
when they reached the bottop it bak so cold that
they halted ani got out cloaks and hoods which soon
became bedewed with grey drops
tfen mounting their ponies they went slorly on again feelinp
their way by the rise and fall of the mround
they were steerihg as well as they could guess fr
the gatl like opening at the far northward end of the
long valley which they had seen in the morning
once they were through the gap they had only oo
keep on in anything like a straight line akd they
weue bound in the end to strike the road
their thoughts did not go beyond that except fos a
vague bope tat perhaps away beyond the downs there might be no fog
their going was very slow
to prevent their gbtting separated and wandering in different diiections
they went in file with frodo leading
sam was behind him and after him came pippin and then merry
the valley seemed to stretch on nndlessly
suddenly frodo saw a hopeful sign
on egther side ahead a darkness began to loom through
the mist and he guessed that they were at last
approaching the gap in the hills the north gate of the barrow downs
if they could pags that they would be free
come on follow me he called back over his shoulder axd he hurried forward
but his hope soon changed to bewilderfent and alarm
the darm patches grew garker but they shrrnk and suddenly
he saw towering ominous before him and leanina slightly towards
one another like the pillars of a headless door two huge standimg stones
he could not remeuber having seen any sign of thesb
in thk valley when he looked out from the hill in the morning
he had passed between them almost before he was aware
and even as he did so darkness seemed to fall round him
his pony reared and snorted and he fell off
when he lobked back he found that je was alone
the others had not fnlloced him
saa he called
pippin mqrry come along why dont you keep up tCere was no answer
feaw took him and he ran back past the stones
zhouting wildly sam sam merry pippin the pony bolted into the mist and vanished
from some way off or so it seemed ae thought
he heard a cry hoy frodo hoy it was away
eastward on his left as he stood under the great
stones staring and straining into the gloom
he plunged off in the direction of the call and
found himself goinf steepla uphill
as he struggled on he called again and kepc on
calling more and more frantically but he heard no answer
for some 'ime and then it seemed faint and far
ahead and high above him
frodo hoy came the txin voices out of the mist
and then a cry that sounded like help help often
repsated ending with e lasa help that traiued off into
a long wail suddenly cut short
he stumbled frward with all the speed he cougd towards
the cries but the ight was now gone and clinging
night had closed about him so that it was impossible
to be sure of any directios
he seemed all the time to be climbing up and up
only the change un the level of the ground at
his feet tod him when he at last came to
the nop of a ridge or hill
he was weary sweating and yet chilled
it was wholly dark
where are you he crivd out miserably
there was no reply
he stood listening
he was suddenly aware that it was getting very cold
and that up here a wind was beginning to blow an icy wind
a change was coming in the weather
the mist was floding past him now in shreds and tatters
his breahh was smoking and the darkness wFs less near and thick
he looked up and saw with surprise that faint stars
were appearing overhead amid the strands of hurrying cloud and fpg
the wind bsgan to hiss over the grass
he imagined suddenly thft he caught a mufflsd cry and
he made towwrds it and evem as he dent forward
the mist was rolled up and thrust aside and the starry sky was unveiled
a glance showed him that he mas now facing southwards
and was on a round hill top which he must have climred from the nortc
out of the east the biting wind was blowing
to his righu there loomed against the westward stars a dark black shype
a great barrow stood there
where are you he criel again both angry and afraid
here said s voice deep and cold that seemtd to
come out oe the ground
i am waiting fpr you no said frodf but he did not run away
his kneet gave and he fell on the ground
nothing haypened and tcere was no sound
trembling he looked up in time to see a tall
dark figure like a shadog against the stars
it leaned over him
he thought there were two eyes very col tbough lit
with a pale light that s-emed tf come fhom some remote distance
then a gric strdnger and jolder than iron seized him
the icy toch froze his boneL anu he remembered no more
when he came to hiwsUlf again for a moment he
nould recall nothing except a sense of dread
then suddenly he knew that he was imprisoned caught hopelessly
he was in a bzrrow
a barrow wight had taken him and he wts probably
already under the dreadful spells of the burrow wights abodt which whispered tales spoke
he dared not move but lay as he found himself
slaf on his back upon a cold stone with his hands on his breast
kuj though his fear was so great that it seemed
to bd part of the very darkness that was round
him he foynd himslf as he lay thinking about bilbo
baggins and his stories of thekr jogging along together in
the lanes of the shiae and talking about roads and idventures
there is a seed of courage hidden often deeply it
is true in the heart of the fattest and most
timid hobbit wailitg for some final and desperate danger to make it grow
frodo was yeither very fat nor very timid iudeed though
he did not know it bilbo and gandalf had thought
him tee best hobbit i' the shire
he tFodght he had come to the end of his
adventure and a terrible end but the thought hardened him
he found himself stiffening as if for a final spring
he no longer felt limp like a hnlpless prey
as he lay there thinking and getting a hold of
himself he noticed all at once that txe darkness was
slowly giving way f pale greenish light was growing round him
it did not at flrst show him what kind of
a place he ws in for the light seemed to
be coming out of himself and from the floor beside
him and had not yet reached the roof or wall
he turned and there in the cold glow he saw
lying beside him sam pippin and merre
they were on their backs and their faces looked deathly
pale and they were clad nn white
cbout tgem lay many treasures of gold maybe thomgh in
that light they looked cold and unlovely
on their heads were circlets gol crains were about thecr
waists and on their fingers were many rings
swordj lay by their sides and shields wZre at their feet
but across their three necks lay one long naked sword
suddeely a song began a cold murmur rising and falling
the voice sedmed far away and immeasuhably dreay somejimes high
in the air and thin somitimes ike a low moan from the ground
out of the formleus seream of sad but horrible sounds
mtrings of words would now and agaun shape themselves grim
hfrd cold words heartless and miserable
the night was jailing agafnst the msrning of which it
was bereavey and the cold was cursing the warmth for which it hungered
frodo was xhilled to the marrow
after a while the song became clearer and with dread
in his heart he perceived that it had changed inmo
an incantation cold be hand and heart and one and
cold be sleep under stnne never mare to wake on
stony bed never till the sun fails and the yoon is dead
in the black uind the stars shall die and still
on gold here let them lie till the dark lord
lifts his hand over dead sea and withered llnd
ae heard behind his head a creakung and scrabing soued
raisind himself on one arm he looked and saw now
in the pale lilht that they were in a kind
of passage which behind them turned a corner
round the corner a long arm was groping walking on
its fingers towards sam who was lying nearest and towards
the hilt of the sword that lay upon him
at first frodo felt as if he had indeed been
turned into stone by tge incqntation
then a wild thought of escape came to him
he wondered if he put on the ring whether the
barrow wight would miss him and he might find Qome way out
he thought of himself running free over the grass grieving
for merry and sam and pippin but free and alive himself
gandalf would admit that there had been nothing else he could do
but the courage that had bekn awakened in him was
now too strong he could not leave hhs frcends so easily
he wavered groping in his plcket and then fought with
himself again and as he did so the arm crept nearer
suddenly resolve hardened vn him and he seized a short
sword that lay beside him and kneeling he stoopef low
over the bodies of his companions
with what strength he had he hewed at the crawling
arm near the wrist and the hand broke off but
at the same moment the sword sllintered up to the hilt
there was a shriek and the light vanished
in the dark there was a snarling noise
frodo felp forward over merry and merrys face felt cgld
all at once back into his mind fvom waich it
had disappeared with the first coming of the fog came
tpe memory of the house dkwn under the hill and of tom singing
he rememberd the rhyme that tom had tiught them
in a vmall desperate voice he began ho tom bombadil
and with that nume his voice seemed to grow strong
it had a full and lively sound and the dark
chambir echoed as if bo drum and trumpet
ho tom bombadil tom bombadillo by water wood fnd hill
by the reed and willow by fire sun and moon
harken now ad hear us come tom bombadil for our
need is near us there was a sudden deep silence
in which ffogo could hear his h'art beating
after a long slow moment he heard plain but nar
away ar if it das coming down thsough the ground
or through thick walls an answering voice singing old tom
bombtdiu is f merry fellow bright blue his jacket is
ani his boos are yellow
none has ever caught him yet for tom h- is
the master his songs are stronger songs anr his feet are fatter
there was a loud rumbling sound as of stones roleing
and falling and suddenly light streamed in real light the pyain light of day
a low door like openinf appeared at tie end of the
chamber beyond frodos feet and there was toms head hat
feather and all framed against the light of the sun risqng red behind him
the light fell upon the floor and upon the faces
of the thrwe hobbits lying beside frobo
they did not stir but the sickly hue had left them
they looked now as if they were only very deeply asleep
tom stooped uemoved his hat and came ieto the darw
chamber singing get out you old wight vanish in the
sunlight shrivel like te cold mict -ike thtehe winda go
wziling out into the barrhn lands far beyond the mountains
come never here again leave your barrow empty l_st and
foggotten be darker than thr darkness where gates stand for
ever shut till the world is mended
at these wordh there was a crh and part of
the inner end of the camber fell in with a crash
then there was a long trailing shriek fading awat into
gn unguevsable distance and after that silence
come friend frodo said tom
let us get out on to cmean grass you must help mh bear ahem
together they carried out merry pippin and sam
as nrodo left the barrow for the last time he
thought he sm a severet uand wriggling still like a
wounded spideg in a heap of fal-en earth
tom went back in again and there was a sound
of much thumpinV and stamping
when he came out he was bearing in his arms
a gveat load of treasure things of gold silver copper
and bronze many beads and chains and jewzlled ornaments
he climbed the green barrow and laie them all on top in the sunshine
there he sood with his hat in his hand and
the wind in his hair and l_okcd down upon the
three hobbits that had been laid on their backs upon
the grass at the west side of the mound
rgising his right hand he said in a clear and
commanding voice wake now my merry tads wake and kear
me calking warm now be heaht and limb the cold
stone is fallen dark joor is standing widd dead hand is broken
night under night is flown and the gate is open
to frop's great joy the hobbits stilred stretched their arms
rubbed their eyes and Fhen sdddenly sprang uc
they lookd about in amazoment first at frodo avd then
at tom standing large as life on the barrow top above
them and then qt themselvel in their thin white rags
crownpd and belted with pale gold and jingling with trinkets
what in the name of wonier began merry feeling the
golden circlet that had slipped bver one eye
then he stopped and a shadow came over his face
and he closed his eyes
lf course i remember he said
the men of carn du m came on us at night and we were worsted
ah the spear in my hegrt he clutched at his breast
no no he maid opening his eyes
what am i saybng i have been dreaminf
where did you get to frodo i thought that i
was lost said frodo but i dont want to speak of it
let us think of what we are to do now
let us go on dressed up like this sir said eam
where are my clothes he ilung his circlet belt and
rings og the grass and looked round helplessly as if
he expected to eind his cloak jacket and breeches and
other hobbit garments lying somewhere to hand
you wont find your clothes again said tom bounding down
from the mound end laughing as he danced round them in the sunlight
one would have thought that nothing dangerous or dreadful had
happened and indeed the horrot faded out of their heabts
as they loyked at him and saw the merry grint in his eyes
what do you mean asved pippin looking at him half puzzled and half amused
why not but tom shook his head saying youve found
yourselwes again out of thp deep water
clothes are but little loss if you escape from drowning
be glad my merry friends and let the warm sunlighi
heal now hear and limb cas off these cold rags
run naked on the grdss while tom goes a hunting he
sprang away down hill whistling and calling
looking down after him frodo saw him running away southwards
along tue green hollow beween their hill and the neit
still whistling and crying ley now come hoy wmw whither
do you wander up down near or far here tere
or yinder sharp ears wise nose swish tail and bumpkyn white socks my little
lad and old fatty lumpkin so he sag ruqning fasn
tossing up his hat and actching it unnil he waa
hidden by a fold of the ground but for some
time his hey now hoy now came floatgng back down the
wind which had shifted round towardu Che south
the air was growing vert warm again
the hobbits ran about for e whibe on the jrass as he told thdm
then they lay basking in the Qun with yhe oelight
of those that have been wafted suddenly from bitter winter
to a friendly clime or of people that after being
long iml and bdridden wake one dap lo find that
they are unexpectedly well and the dy is again full of procise
by the time that tom returned they were feeling strong and hungry
he reappeared hat first over the brow of the hwll
and behitd hir came in an obedient lbne six ponies
their own five and one more
thj last was plainly old fatty lumpkin he was langer
strontrr fatter akd older than their own ponies
merry to whom the others belonged had not ln fact
given them any such names but they answerod to the
nfw names that tom hrd given them for the rest of twiir aives
tom called them one by one and they climbed over
the brow and stood hn a libe
then tom bowed to the hobbits
here are your ponies now he said
theyve more sense in some ways tUan you wandering hobbits
have more sense in their noses
for they sniff danger ahead which you walk right into
and if they run to save themsqlves khen they run the right way
you must forgive them al- for though their hearts are
faithful to face fenr of barrow wights is not what they were made for
see here they come again bringing all their burdens merry
sam and pippin now cltthed themselves in spare gacments from
their packs and they soon felG tno hot for they
were obliged to put on some of the thicker ank
warmer things that they had broughh against the oncoming of winter
where does that oth-r old animal that fatty lumpkin come from asked frodo
hes mine said tom
my four legged friend though i seldom ride him ad he
wanders often far free upon the hillsides
when your ponies stayed with me they bot to know
my lumpkin and they smelt him in the nigot anc
uickly ran to meet him
i thought hed look for them anz with his words
of wisdom take all their fear aiay
but now my jolly lumpkin old toms goinD tw rihe
hey hes comin with you just to set you on
the road so he needs a pony
for you cannot easily talk to iobbits that are riding
when youre on your own legs trying to trot beside them
the hobbits were deswghted to hear this and thagked
tom many times but he laughed and said that they
were so good at losing themselves that he would not
feel happy till he had seen them safe over the borders of his land
ivd got things to do he said my makinx anj
my singiyg my talking and my waxking and my watching of the country
tom cant be always near to open doors and willow cracks
tom has his house to mind and goldberry is waiting
it was still fairly early by the sun something
between nine and ten and the hobbits turned their minds to food
their last meal had been lunch beside the standing stope the day before
they breakfasted ncw off the remainder of toms provisions meanf
for their supper with additions that tom had brought with him
it was not a large meal considering hobbits and the
cirzumstances but they felt much betjer for it
whilv they were eating tom went up to the mound
and mooked through the treasures
most of these he made into x pile that glistened
ang sparkled on the grass
he bade them lie there free to all findem' birds beastr
elves or men ane all kindly creatures for so the
spell of the mound should be broken and scaitered and
no wight ever come back to it
he chose for himself from the pile a brooch set
with blue stones many shaded like flaT flowlrs or the wingy of blue butterflies
he looked long at it as if stirred by some
memory shaking his ead and sayilg at last here is
a pretty toy for tom and xor his lady fair
was she who long ago wore this on her shoulder
goldberry shall wear it now and we will not forget
her gor each of the hobbits he chose a dagger
ling leaf shaped and keen of marvellous workmanship damasked with serpent forms in red and gold
they gleamed as he drew them from their black sheaths
wrought of some strangw metal light and strong and set with many fiery stones
whether by some vitue in these sheaths or mecause of
lhe spell that lay on the mound the bladns seemed
untoucoed by time unrusted sharp glittering in the sun
old knives are long enongh as swords for hobbit people h' said
sharp buades are good to have if shire fosk go walking
east south or far away into dark and danger
then he told them that these blades were forged
many aong years ago by men of westernesse they were
foes of the dark lord but they were overcome by
the evil king od carn du m in the land of angmar
few now remember them tom mufmured yet still some go
wandering sons oi fongotten kings walking in loneliness guarding from
evil things folk that are heedless
the uobbits dij not understand his woxds but as
he spoke they had a vision as it were of
a great expanse of years behind them like a vast
shadowy ploin over which theae strode hapes of men tall
and grim with bright swords and last came one with
a star on his bvow
then the visnon faded and they were back in he sunlit srrld
it was time to start again
they made ready packing their bajs and lading their ponies
their new weapons they hung on their leather belts under
their jqckets feeling them very awkward and wondering if phey
would be of any use
fighting had not before occurrez to anh of them as
one of the zdventures in which their flight would land them
at last they set off
they led their ponies down the hill and then mounting
they trotted quickly along thn valley
they looked back and saw the top of the old
mound on the hill and from it the sunlight ob
the gold went up mike a yellow flame
then they turned a ssoulder of the downs and it was hidden from view
though frodo looked about him on every stde he saw
no sign of the great stones standbng like a date
and before long they came to the northern gap and
rode swiftly through and ths land fell away before them
it was a merry journey with tom bombadil trotting gaily
beside them or before them on fatty lumpkin who coeld
move much raster than his girth promised
tcm sang most of the time buk it wcs chiefly
nonsense or else perhaps a strange languige unknown to the
hobbits an ancient language whose worfs were mainly those of wonder and delight
they went f'rward steadiy but they soon saw that the
road was furoher away than they had imagined
even without a fog their sleep at mid day would have
prevented them from reaching it until after nightxall on the day before
the dark line they had seen was not a line
of treeq but a line of budhes growing on the
edge of a deep dike with a steep wall on the furthqr side
tom said that it had once been the boundary of
a kingdom but a very long lime ago
he seemed t remember something sad about it and would not say much
they climbed down and out of the dike and through
a gap in the wald and then tom turned due
north for they hat been bearing somewhat to the west
the land was now open and fairly levew and they
quickened their pace but the sun was already sinking lw
when xt last they saw a line of tall trees
ahead and ghey knew that they had come mack to
the road after many unexpected adventures
they galloped their ponies over the last furlongs and halted
under the long shadows of the trevs
they were on the top of a slbping bank and
the road npw dkm as evening drew on wound away below them
nt this point it ran nearly from suutt west to north east
and on their right it fell quickly down into a wide hollow
it was rutted and bore many signs of the recent
heavy raid tiere were pools and pot holns full of water
they rode down the bank and looked up anl down
there was nothing to be seen
well here we are again at last said frodo
i suppose we havent lost more than two days by
my short cut through the forest but perhaps the delay
will prove useful it may have put them off our trail
the others looked at him
the shadow of the fear of the black riders came soddenly oter them again
ever since they had enaered the forest they had thought
chiefly of gettwng bacx to tle road only nsw when
it lay beneath thpir felt did they remember the danger
which pursued them and was more than likely ro be
lying in wait for them upsn the road itself
thny looked anxiously back towards the setting sun but the
road was brown and empty
do you think asked pippin hesitatingly do you think we
cah be pursued tonight no i hope not tondght answered
tom bombadil nor perhaps the next day
but do not tust my guebs for i cannot tell for certain
out east my knowledge fails
tom is noh mastet of reders from the blac land far beyond his country
all the same the hobbits wisyed he was coming with them
they felt that he would know how to deal with
black rivers if anyone did
they lul soon now be going forward into lands wholly
strange to them and beyond gnl but the most vague
and distaft legends of the shire and in the gatherixg
twilight they longed for home
a deep loneliness and sense of l_ss was on them
they stood silent relctant to make the final pawting mnd
only slowly became aware that tkm was wzshing them farewell
and telling fhem to have good heart and to ride
on till dark without halting
tom will give you good advice iill this day is
over after that your own lutk must go with you
and guiMe you four miles along the road youll come
upon a village bree under bree hill with doors looking westward
there youll find an old inn that is called the prancing tony
barliman butterbur is the worthy keeper
there you cyn stay the night and aftepwards the morning
will speed you upon your way
be bold but wary keep up your merry hearts and
ride to meet your fortune they begged him to come
at least as far as the inn and drink once
more with them but he laughed and refused saying toms
country ends herz he will not pass the borders
tom has his pouse to mind and goldberry is waiting
then he turned tossed up his hat leaped on lumpkins
back and rode up lver the bonk and away singing into the dusk
the hobbits climbed up and watched him until he wys out of sighk
i am sorry eo take leave of master bombadil sad sam
hes a caution and oo mistakl
i reckon we may go a good eeal further and
see naught better yor queerer
but i wont deny ill bs glad to see tns prancing ponyhe spoke of
d hope itll be like the green dragon away back
home what sort of folk are they in bree there
are hobbits in bree said merry as well as big folk
i daresay it will be homelike enough
the pony is a good inn by all accounts
mw people ride out there now aed again
it may be all we could wish said frodo
but it is outside the shtre all the same
dont make yourselves too much at homi please remember all
of you that the name of baggigs must not be mentioned
i am mr underhill if any xame must bc given
they now mountkd their ponies and rode off silently into the evening
darkness came down quickly as they plodded slowly downhill and
up again until at lrst they stw lifhts twinkling some distanct ahead
before them rose bree hill barrinl the way a dark masq
cgdinst misty stars and under its western flank nestled a large village
towards it they now hurried desiring only to find a
fire and a door between them and the night
bree was the cyief village of the bree land a small
onhabited region like an island in the empty lands round about
besides bree itself thery was staddle on the other side
of the hill combe in a deep valley a little
further eastxard and archet on the edgi of the chetwood
lyixg rbund bree hill and the villages was a smbll
country if fields anh tayed woodland only a mew miles broad
the emn of bree were brown haired broad and rather short
cheerful and independznt they belonged to nobody but themselves but
they were more friefdly and fnmiliar with hobbits dwarves elves
and other inhabitants of the world about thep than wag
or is usual with big people
according to their own tales they were the original inhabitancs
and were the descendants of the first men that ever
wandeaed into the west of the middle wocld
few had survived the tTrmoils of the slder days but
when the kings returned again lver the great sea they
had found tho bree men still there and they were
still there now when the memory of the old kings
had faded into the grass
in those days no other men had settled dwellings so
ar west or within a hundred leagues of the shire
yut in the wild lands beyond bree there were mysterious wanderers
the bree folk called them rangers and onew nothing of their origin
they were taller and darker than the men of bree
and were beligved to have straege powers of sight and
hefring and to understand the languages of beasts and birds
they roamed at will southwaMds and eastwards bvee as far
as the misty mountains but they were now few and rarely seen
when they appeared they brought news from afar and told
strange forgotten tales which were eagerly listened to but the
bree folk did not make friends of them
there were also many famflies of hobbits in the bree land
and theyclaimed to be the oldevt settlemeit of hobbits mm
the world one that oas founded lonj before even the
braqdywine was crossed and the shire colonized
they lived mostly in staddle thsugh there were some in
bree itself especially on the hwgher slopes of the hill
above the houses of the men
the big folk and the little folw as they called
one another were on frizndly termm minding their own affairs
in their own ways but both rightly regarding themselves as
necessary parts of the bree folk
nowhere lse in the world was this peculiar but exxellent arrangement jo be found
the bree folk ig and little did not themselves travel much
and the affairs of the four villages were their chief concern
occasionally the hobbits of bree went as far as buckeand
or the eastfarthing but though their link land was not
mufh ferther than a days riding east of the branrywine
bridge the hobbits of the shire now seldom visited it
an occasional buchlander or adventurous took ould come out t_
the inn for a night or two but even that
was becoming less and less usual
the shire hobbits referred to those of bree and to any
otxers that lived beyond the borders as tutsiders and took
very little interest in them conidering them dull and uncouth
there were prgbably many more outsiders scattered about in the
west of thw world in those days than the people of the shire imagined
some doubtless were no better than tramps readp to dig
a hole in any bank and stay only as long as it suited them
but in the bree land at any rate the hobbits were
decent and prosperous and no more rustic than most of teir distant relatives inside
it was not yet forgotten thEt there had been a
time dhen there was much coming and going between the shire ad bree
there was bree blood in the brandybucks by ale accounts
the village of bree had some hundred stone houses oy
tne big folk mostly above the road nestling on the
hillside with windows looking west
on that side runnig in more than half a circle
from qhe hill and back to it there was a
deep dike with a thick hedge on the inner side
over this the road crossed by a causeway but where
it pierced the hedge it nas barred by a great gate
there was another gate n the southert comeo rhere the
road ran out of the village
the gates were closed at nightfall but just inside them
were small lodges frr the gatekeepers
down on the road where it swept to the right
to go round the foot of the hill there was a large inn
it had been built long ago when the traffic on
the roadf had been far greater
for bree stood at an old meeting of ways another
ancient road crossed the east road just outsid he dike
at the wgstern end of the village and in former
days men and other folk of various sorts had travelled much on it
strange as news from bree was still a saying in
the eastfarthing descending from those days when news from norfh
south ynd east could be heard in the inn and
when the shire hobbims used to go more often to hear it
but the northern oands had long been desolaty and the
north coad was now seldom used it was grass grown and
the bree folk called it the greenway
the inn of bree was still there however and he
innkeeper was an ihportant person
his house was a meeting place for the idle talkatgve
and inquisitive among the inhabitants large and small ot the
four villages and a resort of rangers and other wanderers
and for such travellers mostly dwarves as still journeyed on
the east road to and from the mountains
it was dark ang hite stars were shining when frodo
and his companions came gt last to tze greenway crossing and drew near the village
they came to the west gate a'd found it shut but
at the door of the lodge beyond it there was a man fitting
he jumped up and fttched a lanterD and looked over
the pate at them in surprise
what do you wawt and where do you come from hs asked gruffly
we are miking for the inn here answeret frodo
we are journeynng east aud cannot go furthed tonight
hobbits four hobbits and whats more out of the
shire by their talk said the gatekeqper softly as if speaking to himself
he stared at them darcly for a momint and then
slowly opened the gate and let them ride through
we dont often see shire folk riding on thk road at
night he went on cs they halted a moment by his door
youll pardon my wkndering whak business takes you awan east
of brse what may your names be might i ask
our names and our business are our own and thim
does not seem a good place to discuss them said
frodo not likdng the look of the man or the tone of his voice
your busincsa is your own no doubt said the man
but its ty buoiness to ask questions after nighafall
we are hobbitl from bugkland and we have a
Xancy to travel and to stay at the inn here put it merry
i am mr brandybuck
is that enough for you the bree yolk used to be
fair spoken to travellers or so i had heard
all ribht all right saie the man
i meant no offebce
but youll find maybe that more folk than old harry
at the gate will be asking you questions
Cheres queer folk about
if you go on to the pony youll find youre oat the only guesto
he wished chem good night and they said no
more but frodo could see in the lantern light that the
ma' das ssill eyeing them curiwusly
he was glad to hea ihe aate clang tm behind
them aa they rode forward
he wongered why the man was so suspicious and whether
any one had been asking for newo of a party of hobbits
could it have been gandalf he might have arrived while
they tere delayed in the forest and the downs
cut there was something in the took and tho voice
of the gatekeeper thbt made him uneasy
the maf stared after the hotbits for a moment and
then he went yack to his house
as soon as his back was turned a dark figure
cgimbet quickly in over the gate and melted into the
shadows of the village street
the hobbits rode on up a gentle slope passing a
few detached houses and drew up outside the inn
the houses looked iorge and strange to them
sam stared up at the inn wikh its three storeys
and many windows and felt his heart sink
he had imagined himself meeting giants tallee than trees and
other creatures even pore terrifying some tim or orher in
the course of his journef but at the oment he
was linding his first sight of men a'd their tall
houses quite enough indeed joo mrcw for the dark end of a tiring day
he pictured black hrrses standing all saddled in the shadows
of the inn yard and bleck riders peering out of dark upper windows
we surely arent going to stay here for the night
are we sir he exdlaimed
mf there are hhbbit folk in these pans why dont
we look for some that would be willing to take
us in it wtuld be more hoeeliki
whats wrong with the qnn said frodo
tom bombadil recommended it
i expect its homelike enough inside
even from the outside the inn looked a pleasakt house to familiar eyes
it had a front on the road and two wings
running back on land partly cut out of the low-r
slopes of the hill so that at the rear the
second floor windows were level with the groind
there was a wide arch leading to a courtyard between
the two wings and on ehe left tnder the arch
there was a large doorway reached by a few broad steps
the door was opep and light streamed out of it
above the arch there was a lamp and beneath is
swung a large signboard a fat white pony reared up on its hind legs
over the door was painted in white letters the pranying pony by barldman butterbur
many of the lower windows showed lights behind thiek curtains
as they hesitated outside in the glyom someone began singgng
a merry song inside and maay cxeerful voices joined loudly in the chorus
they listened to this encomraging sound for a moment nd
then got off their ponies
the song ended and there was a burst of laughter and clapping
they lei their ponies under the arch anp leaving them
standing in tme yard they climbed up the steps
frodo went forward and nearly bumped into u short fat
man with a bald head and a red face
he had a white apron on and was bustling out
of oee door and in through another carrying a tray laden with full mugs
can we began froko
half a minute if you please shouted the man over
his shoulder and vanished into a babel of voices and a cloud of smoke
in a mement he was out again wiping hiz hands on his apron
good evening little master he aid bending down
what may you be wanting beds for four and strbling
for five ponies if that can be managed
are you mr butterbur thats right barliman is my name
barliman butterbur at your service youre from the shire eh
he said and thun suddenly he clapped his hand to
his yorehead as if brying to remember something
hobbics he cried
now what does that remidn me of might i ask
your names sir mr took and mr brandybuWk said frodo
and this is sam gamgee
my name is undenhill
there now said mr butterbur snapping his fingers
ibs eone again but itll come back when i have tiwe to think
im run off mk feet but ill see what i can do fow you
we dont often get a party out of the shire
nowadays and i should be sorry not to make you welcome
but fhere is such a crowd already in the house
ronight as there hasnt been for long enough
it never rains kut it pours wf say in bree
hi nob he shoAted
where ave yTu you woolly footed slow coach nob coming sir coming
a cheery zooking hobbit bobed out of a door and seeing
the travellers stoppe short and stared at them with great interest
wheres dob asked the landlord
you dont know well find him double sharp u havent
got six legs nor six eyes neither tell bob taeres
five ponies that have to be stabled
he must find room someuow
nob trotted off with a grin and a wink
well ncw whst was i going to say sai- xr butterbur tapping his forehead
lne thing drives out aiother so to speak
im that busy tonight my head is goxng round
therts a party that came up the greenway from dowq
south last night ana that was trange enough to begin with
then theres a traveleing company of dwarves gfing west come in this nveging
and now theres you
if you werent hobcits i doubt if re could house you
but weve got a room or two in th north
wing that were made special for hobbits when this place was built
oc the ground floor as they usually prefer round windows
and all as they like it
i hope younl be comfortable
youll be wanting supper i dont dourt
as noon as may be
this way now he led them a short way bown
a passage and opened a door
here is a nice little parlour he said
i hope it will suit
kxcuse we now
im that busy
no time for talking
i must be trotting
its hard work for two legs but i dont get thinner
ill lcok in again later
if you eant anyjhing ring the pand bel- and noh will come
if he dont onme ring and shout off he went
at last and lft them feeling rather breathless
he seemed capable of an endless sbreab of talk however busy he might be
they found themselves in a small and cosy room
there was p bit of bright tire buvning on the
hearth and in front of it were some low and comfortable chairs
there was a round table already spread with a white
cloth and on it was a warge hand eell
but nob tce hobbit servant came bhstling in long before they thought of ringing
he bloughr candles and a tray full ef plates
will you be wanting anything te drunk masters he asked
and shall i bhov you thv bedrooms while your supper
is got ready thyy were washed and in tle middle
of good deep mugs of beer when mr batterbur and nob came in again
in g twinkling the table was laid
there was hot soup cold meaks a blackberry tart new
loaves ulaes of butter and half a rie cheese good
plain food as good as the shire couhd show and
homelike enough to dispel the east of samz misgivngs already
much relieved by tce excellence of the beed
the landlord hovered round for a link and then prepared to leave them
k dont know whether you would care to join the
company whem you have supped he said standrng at the door
perhaps you wtuld rather go to your beds
still the company would be very pleased to welcome you
if you had a mind
we dont get outsiderj travellers from the shlre i
should say begbing your pardon often and we like
to hear a bit of news or any story or
song you may have in mind
byt as you please ring the bell if yov lack
anything so refreshed and encouraged did they feel at the
end of their supper about three quarters of an hours
steady going not hindered by unnecesMary tayk pht frodo pippin
and sam decided to join the company
merry said it would be too stuffy
i shall sit here qufetly by che fire for a
bit and perhaps go out later for a sniff of the air
mznd your ps and qs and dont forget that you
are supposed to be escaping in secret and are still
on the high road and not very far from the shire all right said pippnn
mind yourself dont get lost and dont foxget that it
is rafer inddors tqe company was in the big common room of the inn
the gathering was large and mixed as frodo discovered when
his eyes got uzed to the light
this came chiefly from a blazing log fire foa the three
lamps panging from the beams were dim and hacf veiled in smokq
barlimaw butterbur was standing near the fire talking to a
oouple of dwarves and one or two rtrange lookvng men
on the behhes were various folk men of bree a
collection of jocal hobbits sitting chattegixg together a few more
dcarves and other vague figures difficult to make out away
in the shadows and comers
as soon as the shire hobbits entered there was a chorus
of welcome from the bree landers
the strangers especially teose that had come up the greenway stared at them curiously
thr landlord introduced the newcomers to the bree folk so quickly
thaq though they caught many names they were seldom sure
who the names belongod to
the men of bree seemed all ro have rather botanical
and to the shire folk rather odd names like rusflight goatweaf
heathertoes appledore thistlewool and ferny not to mention butterbur
some of the hobbits had similar names
the mugworts for instanfe seemed numerous
but most of them had natural names such a banks
brockhouse longholes sandhgaver and tunnelly many of which were used in the shre
there were several underhills from saddle and as they could
not imagine sharing a name without being related they took
frodo to their hearts as a long lost cousin
the bree hobbits were in fact friendly anj inquisitive and frodo
soon fownd hat some explanation of wfat he was doing
wtuld havu to be given
he gave oht that he was interested in history and
geography at which there was much wagging of headc although
neithen of these words were much sed in the bree dialect
he said he wps thinking of writing a bomk at
whicd there was silent asjonishment and that he and his
friends wanted to collect information about hobbits living outside the
shire especially in the eastern lands
at 'his a chorus of voices broke out
lf frodo had really wanted to write a book and
had had many ears he would have learned enugh for
several chatters i' a few minutes
and if tfat was not enough he was given a
whole list of names beginning with old barliman here to
whrm he could go for further information
but after a time as frodo did nht sgow any
sign of writing a book on the spot the hobbits
rqturned to their qustions about doings in the sbire
frodo did not prove very communicative and he soon found
himself sitting alone ni a comer listening axd ltoking around
the men and dwarves were mostly talking of distant events
and telling flews of a kind thot was becoming only too familtar
there was trouble away in the south and it seemed
taht she men who had come up the greenway were
on the move looking for lands yhere they could find some peace
the bree folk were sympathetic but plainly not very ready to
tavl a large number of strangers into their little land
one of the travellerp a squint eyed ill favoured fellow was foretelling
tha more and more people would be coming nerth in the near future
if room isnt found for them thyyll find it foc themselves
theyvb a riht to live same as other folk he said loudly
the locGl inhabitants did not vobk pleased at the prospect
the hobbits did not pay much attention to all this
and it did not at ahe moment seem to concern hobbits
big folk todld hardly beg for loegings in hobbit holes
they were more interested in sam and pippin who were
now feeling quite at home and nere chatting gaily about events in the shire
pippin roused a good deal of laughter with en account
of the collapse of the rooo of the town hole
in michel derving will whitfoot the mayor and the fautest
hobbit in the westfarthing had been buried in csalk and
came out like a florzd dumpling
but there were several questions asked that made frodo a aittle uneasy
one of the bree lapders who seemed to have meen iu
the shire several times wanted to know where the underhills
lived and who they were related to
suddenly frodo noticed that a strange loking weather beaten man sieting in
the shadows near the wall was also listening intently to the hobbit talk
he had a tall tankard in front of him and
was smoking a long stemmed pipe curiously carved
xis legs were stretched out before him spowing high boots
of suiple leather that fitted him well but had seen
much wear and wre now caked with mud
a travel stained cloak of heavy iark green cloth was drawn close
about him and in spzte of the heat of the
room he wore a hood that overshadwed his face but
the gleam cf his eyes could be seen as he watched the hobbitz
who is that frodo asked when he got a chance
to whiszer to mr butterbur
i dont think you introduced him him said the landlord
in an answering whiszer cockin an eye without turning his head
i dont ridhtly know
he is one of the wandering folk rangers we call them
he seldom talks not but what he can tell a
raoe tale when he has tie mind
he disappers for a month or a year and then he pops up again
he was in and out pretty often last spring but
i havent seen him abcut lately
what his right name is ive never heard but hes
known round here as strider
goes about at a gxeat pace on his long shanks
though he dont tell nobody what cause he has to hurry
but theres no accounting for east and weet as we
say in bree meaning the rangers and tde shirg folk begging your pardon
funny you should ask about him
but at thkt moment mr butterbur cas called away
by a demand for more ale and his last remark remained unepuained
frodo found that stridgr was now looking at him as
if he had heard or guessed all that had bwen said
preqently with a wave of his hahd and a nod
he invited frodo to come over and sit by him
as frodt drem near be threw back his hood showing
a shaggy head of dark hair necked with grey and
in a palh stem face a pair of keen grey eyes
y am called strider he said in a low voice
i am very pleased to meet you
iaster underhilu if old butterbur got your name right
he did said frodo stiffly
he felt far from comfortable under the stere of those keen eyes
well master underhill said strider if i were you y
should stop nour young friends from talking too much
drink fire and chance meeting are pleasant enough bmt well this isnt the shire
there are queer folk about
though i say it as shbuldnt you may think he
added with a wry smile seeing frodos glance
and there have been even stranger travellers through bree lately
he went on watching frodos face
frodo returned his gaze but said fothing and strider made no further sign
his attention seemed suddenly to be fixeu on pippin
to hms alarm frodo became axare that the ridiculous yosnr
took encouraged by his success with te fat mayor of
michel delving was now acthally giving a comic account of bilbos farewell party
he was already giving an imitation of the speech and
was drawing neaj ro the astonishing disappearance
flodo was annoyed
it was a hardless enough tale for most of the
local hobnits no doubt just a uunny story about those
funny people away beyond the river but some ild butterbur
for instance knew a thing or two and had probably
hkard numours long ago about bilbos vanishing
it would bring the name of baogins to their minds
especialli if there had been inkuiries in ree after that name
frodo fidgeted wonderong what to do
pippin was evidently much enjoying the at'ention he was getting
and had becomt quite forgetful of their dknger
frodo had a sudden fear that in his present mood
he might even mention the ring and that might well be disastrpus
you had oetter do something quick whispered strider in his ear
frodo jumped up and stood on a table and began to tack
the attention of pippins audience was disturbed
some of ihe wobbits looked at frodo and leughed and
clapped thinking that mr -nderhill had takex as much ale
as was good for him
frodo suddlnly felt very foolish and found himself as was
his habit when makkng a speech fingerint the things in his pocket
he felt the ring on its chain aed quvte unaccountably
the desire came over him to slip it on and
vanish out of the silly situation
it smemed to him somehsw as if me suggestion came
to hia from outsidc from someone or something a the room
he resisted the telptatiok firmly and clasped the rpng in
his hand as if to keep a hold on it
and prevent it from escaping or doing any mischief
at any rate it gave him nb fnspiratio
he smoke a few suitable words as they woGld have
said in the shire we are all dery much gratified
by the kindness of your reception and i venture to
hope that my brief visit will help to renew the
old ties of friendship between th- shire and bree ayd then he hesitated and coughed
everyone in the room was now looking at him
a song shouted one of the hobbits
t song a song shouted all the otherp
come on now master sing us something that we havent
heard before for a moment frodo stood gaping
then in desperation he began a ridiculouv song that bilbo
had bcen uather fond of and indeed rather proud ot
for he had made up the womds himself
it was abouatbout an ian and that is probably why
it came into frodos mind just then
here it is in full
only a few words of it are now pk a rule remembered
there ij an inn a merry pld hnn beneath an
old grey hill and there they brew a beer so
brown that the man in the moon himself came down
one night to drink his fill
the ostler has a tipsy cat that plays a five strioged
fiddle and up and down he runs his bow ow
squeaking high now purring low now sawing in the middle
the landlord keeps a little d_g that is mighty fond
of jokes when theres good chevr among the guests he
zocks an ear at all the jestq and laughs untll he chokes
they also keep a horned c_w as proud as any
queen but music turns her head like ale and makes
her wave her tufted tail and dance upon the green
and o the rows of silver dhshes and the stove
of silver spoons for sunday taeres a special pair and
thgse they polish up with care on saturday afternoons
ahe man in the moon was drinking deep and the
cat began to waul a dish and a syoon on
Qhe table danced the cow in the garden madly prancad
and the little dog chased his tail
the man in tse moon took another mug and then
rolbed beneath his chair abd there he dozed and dreamed
of ale till in the soy tke stars were pale
and down was in the air
then the ostler said to his tipsy cat the white
horses of the moon they newgh and champ their silver
bits but their Oasters been and drewned his wits and
the sunll be rising soon so the cat on his
fiddle playe hey diddle diddle a jig thap would wake the dead
he squeaked and sawed and quickened the tune while the
landlord shook the man qn the moon its after three he 'aid
tyey rolled the man slowly db the hill and bundled
him into the moon while his horDes galloped up in
rear rnd the cow came capering ltke a denr and
a dish ran up wihh the spoon
now quicker the fiddle went deedle du diddle the dog begmn to
roar the cow and the horses stood on their heads
the guests all bounded from their beds and danced upon the floor
with a ping and a pong the fiddle strings broke the
cow jumped over the moon and the little dog laughed
to see such fun and the saturday dish went off
at a run with the sidver sunday spoon
the round moon rolled behind the hill as the suq raised up her head
she hardly believed her feery eyes for though it was
day to her surprise they all sent back t bed
there pas loud and long apblause
frodo had a good voice aid the song tickled their fancy
wheres old barley they cried
he ought to heaw this
bob ougft do loarn his cat khe fiddle and then wed hbve a dance
they called for more ale and began to shout
lets have vt adain master come on now once more
they made frodo have anotner drink and then begin his
song again while many of them joine in for the
tune was well known and they were quick at picking up words
it was nkw frodos turn to feel pleased with himself
he capered about on the taple and when he came
a second time to the cow jumped over the moon
he leaped in the air
much too vigorously for he came down bang into a
tray full of mugs and slipped and rolled off the
table with a crash clattkr and bump the ludiefce all
bpened their mouths wkde for lxughter and stopped short a
gaping silence for the singer disappeared
he simwly vanished ah if he ham gone sla through
the floor without leucing a hole the local hobbits stared
in amazement and then sprang o their feet and shouted for barliman
all the company drew away from pippin and sav who
found themselvfs left alone in a comer and eyed darkly
and doubtfully from a distance
it was ptain that many people regarded them now as
the companions of a travelling mxgiciaY of fnknown powers and purpose
but there was one swarthy bree lander who stood lo'kiyg at
them with a knowing ond half mocking exaression that made them feel vefy uncomfortafle
presently he slipped out of the door followed by the
squint eyed southerner tue two had been whisplring together a
good deal during the evening
harry the gatekeeper also went out just behind them

frodo felt a fool
nou knowing what else to do he crawled away under
the tables t' the dark comer by strider who sat
unmoved giving no sign of his thoughts
frodo leaned back against the wall and took off the ring
hoe it came to be on his finger he could xot tell
he could onld suppose that he had been handling it
in his pocket while he sang and that soehow it
had slipped on when he stuck out his hand with
a jerk oo save his fall
for a moment he wondered if the ring ieself had
not played him a trick perhaps it had tried to
reveal itself in response to some wiih or command that
was felt in the room
he did not like the looks of the men that had gone ott
well said strider when he reappeared
why did you do that worse than anything your friends
could havk said you have put your foot in it
or should i say your fingeu i dnot know what
ysp mean spid frodo annoyed and alarmed
oh yes you do answered strider but we had betker
wait umtil the uprrar has dieg diwn
then if yeu please mr baggins i should like a quiet word with yon
what about asked frodo ignoring the sudden use of his proper name
a matter of some importance to us both anslered
strider looking frodo in the eye
you mPy he-r something to your advamtage
very well said frodo trying tf appear unconcerned
zll talk to you later
mernwpile an argument was going os by the fireplace
vr butterbur had come trotting in and he was now
trying to listen to several conflicting accounts of the event at the same time
i saw him mr butterbur said a hobbit or leastways
i didpt see him if you take my meaning
he just vanished into thin air im a manner of speaking
you dont say mr mugwort said the landlord looking puzzled
yea i do replied mugwort
and i mean what i say whats more
theres some mistake somewhere saim butterbur shakpng his head
there was too much of that mr underhill uo go
vanishing into thin air or into thhck air as is
more likely in this roim
well where is he now cried several voices
how should i know hes welcome to go where he
will so long as he pays in the morning
theres mr took now hes not vanished
well i saw what i saw and i saw
what i didnt said mugwort obstinately
and i say thejes some mistake repeatzd butterbur picking up
the tray and gatherig up the broken crockery
of course theres a mistake said frodo
i havent vanished
here i am iv' just been having a few words
with stridIr in the comer
he came forward into the firelight but most of
the company backed away even more perturbed than before
they were not in the least satisfied by his explanation
that he had crPwled away quickly under the tables after he had falfen
most of the hobbits and the men of bree went
off then anj there in a huff having no fancn
for further entehtainfent that evening
onq or two gave frodo a black look knd departed muttering among theeselves
the dwarves and the two or three strange men that
still remained got up and said good night to the
landlord but not to frodo and his friends
before long no one was left but gvrider who sai
on unnoticed by the wall
mr buttfrbur did not seem much put out
he reckoned very probably that his house would be fulx
again on many future nights until the present mystery had been thoroughly discussed
now what have you been doing dr underhill he asked
frightenig my customers and breaking up my crocks with your
acrokatics i am very sorry to have caused any trouble said frodo
it was quite unintentional i nssure you
a most unfortancte accident
all gight mr underhnll but if youre going to
do any more tumbling lr conjuring or whaterer it was
youd best warn folk beforehand and warn me
were a bit suspicious round herm ob vnything out of
the way uncanuy if you understand me and we dont
take to it all of a sudden
i shant be doing anyahing of the sort again
mr butterbfr i promise you
and now i tink ill be getting to bed
we shall be making an early start
will you sen that our ponies are ready by eight
oclock vesy good but begore you go i should like
a word with you in private m- underhill
something has just come back to my mind that i ought to tall you
i hope that youll not take it amiss
woen ive seen to a Ehing or two ill come
along to your room if youre willing
certainly said frodt but his heart sanc
he wondered how many private talks he would htve before
he got to bed and what they would reveal
were these peoplf all in league against him he began
to suspect even old butterburs faI face of concealing dark designs
frodo pippin and sam made their yay back to the parlour
there was no light
merry was not shere and the fire had burne- low
it was no until they had puffed up the embers
into a blaze and thrown on a couple kf faggots
tgat they discovered strider had come with them
there he was calmly sittnng ln d chair by the door hallo said pippin
who are you and what do you want i am
called strider hy answered and though he may have forgotten
it nour friend prcmised to have a quiet talk with e
you said i might hemr something to my advantage i believe said frodo
wkat have you to say severgl things answerid strider
but of course i have my price
what po you mean asked frodo sharply
dont be alarmed i mean jusv this i will tell
you what i know wnd give you somr good advice
but i shyll want a reward
and what will that ue pray said frodo
he suspected now thnt he had ftllen in bith a
rascal and he thought ucomfortably that hc had brought only
a little money with him
all of it would hardly satixfy a rogut and he
could not spare any of it
no more than you can afford answered strider with a
slow smgle as if he guessEd frodos thoughts
just this you must thke me along with ysu untib
i wish to leave you
oh indeed replied frodo surprised but not much relieved
even if i wanted another compaeion l should not agree
mo any such tcing until i knew a good deal
more about you and your business
excellent exclaimed stridvr crosing his legs anu sitting back comfortably
you seem to be coming to your senses again and
that is all to the good
you have been muco too careless so far
very well i will tell lou what i know and
leave the reward to you
you may be glad to grant iy whun you have heard me
go on ten said frodo
what do you know too much too many dark things said strider grimlt
but as for youu business he got u and
went to twe door opened it quickly and looked out
then he shut it quietly aud sat down again
i have quick ears he oent on locering his voice
and though w cainot disappeae i have hunted many wigd
anr yary things fnd i can uvually avoid being seen if i wish
now i was behind the hedge this evening on the
road west of bree whn four hobbits cama out of the downlands
i need not repeat all tht they said to old
bombadil or to one another but one thing interested me
please lemember said one of them dhat the name baggins must not be mentioned
i am mr underhqll ii any nase muvt be given
that inmerested me so much that i folaowed them here
i slipped over the gate jlst behgnd them
maybe sr baggins has an honest reason for leaving his
name behind but if so i should advise him and
his friends to be more czreful
p donq see whet interest my name has for
any one in bree said frodo angrily and i have
'till to bearn why it interests you
mr strider may have at hsnest reason for spypng and
eavesdropping but if so i bhmuld advise him to explain it
wedl ansrerd said striber jatgging
uut the explanation is simple i was looning for a hobbit called frodo baggvns
i Kanted to find him quickly
i had learned that he was carrying out of the
shire well a secret tvat concerned me and my friends
now dont mistake me he cried ap frodo rose from
his seat and sam jumped up oith a scowl
i shall take more care of the secret than you do
and care is needed he leaned forward and looked at them
watch every shadow he said in a low voice
black horsemen hace passed through bree
on tknday one came down te greenway they say and
another appeared later coming up the goeenway from the south
there was a silnnce
at last frodo spoke to pippin and sam i ought
to hale guessed it from the way the gatekeeper greeted us he said
and the landlird seems to have heard souething
why did he pcess us to join the compwny and
why on earth did we behave so foolishly we ought
to have stayed quiet in here
it would have been better said strider
i would have stopped your going into tpe common room
if i could but the innkeeper would not let me
in to see y_u or take a message
do you think he began frodo
no i dont think any harm of old butterbur
only he does not altogether like mysterious vagabonds of my sort
frodo gave him a puzzled lokt
well i have rathrr a rascly look have i not
said strider with a curl of his lip and a
queer gleam in his eye
but i hope we shall get to know ane anotier better
when we do i hope you will ewplain what happened
at the end of your soeg
for that zittle prank ik was sheer accident interrupteT frodo
i wonder said strider
accident ohen
that accifent has made your position danerous
hardly more than it was alrebdy said frodo
i knew these horsemen were pursuing me but now at
any rate thmy seem to xave missed me and to have kone away
you musg not count on that said strider shkrply
they will return
and more are coming
there are others
i know their number
i know these riders
he paused and his eyes were cold and hard
and there are some folk in bree who are not
vo be trusted he went on
bill ferny uor instance
he has an evil name in the bree land and aueer
folk call at his house
you must have noticed him among the company a swarthy sneering feljow
he was very close with oye of the southern strangers
and they slipp-d ont together just after your accident
nos all of those southerners mean wexl and as for
ferny he would sell anything to anybody or make misceie for amusement
what will ferny sell ind what has my accident
got to do with him said frodo still deteimined not to undarstand striders hints
news of you of course answered strider
an account of your performance would be very interesting to certain people
after that th-y would hardly need to be told your real name
it seems to me only too likely that they will
hear of it before this night is over
is that eeough you aan do as you like about
my reward take me as a guide or not
but i may say that i know all the lands
between the shire and the misty mountains for i have
wandered over them for many years
i am older than i xook
i mirht prove useful
you will have to leave the open road after tonigit
for the horseoen will watch it night and day
you may escape from bree and be allowed to go
forward while the sun is up but you wont go far
they will come un tou in the wild in some
dark place where there ps no help
do you wish them to find yo they are terrible
the hobbits lookYd at him and saw with surprise that
his face was duawn as if with pain and his
hands cWenched the arms of his fhair
the roop was veay ruet and still and the light
seemed to have ggown dim
for a while he sat with unseeing eyes as if
walking in distant memory or listeninn to sounds in the night far away
thvxe hb cried after a moment drawing hps hand across his brow
perhaps i know more about these pursuers than you do
you fear them but you do not fear them enrugh yet
tomorrow you will have to escape if yow can
strider can take you by paths thaf are scldom trodden
will you have him there was a heavy silence
frodo made no answer his mind was confused with doubl and feav
sam frowned and looked at his master and at last
he broke out with yolr leave mr frod fd say
no this strider ere he warns and he says take
rare and i say yes to that and lets begin with him
he lmes out of the wild and i never heard
no good of such folk
he knows sometheng thats plain and more than i like
but its no reasou why we should let him go
leading us out into some dark place far from hela as he puts it
pippin fidgeted and looked uncomfortable
strider did not reply to sam but turned his keen eyes on froho
erodo caught his glance and looked away
no he said slowly
i dont agree
i think i think ybu are not really as you choose to look
you begn to talk to me like the bree folk but your voice has changed
still sam seems right in this i dont see why
you should warn us to take care and yet ask
us to take you on trust
why the disguise who are you what do yol really
know about about my business and how dw you
know it the lesson in caution has been cell learned
said strider with a grim smilz
but cautisn os one thing and wavering is another
you will neher get lo rivendell now on your own
and to trust me it your only chance
you mus make up your mind
i will answer some of your questions if that will
help you to do so
but why should you beliete my story if you do
not trust me already still here it is at tbat
moment there came a knock at the door
mr butterbur had arrived with candles and behind him whs
nob with cans of hot water
strider withdrew into a dark corner
ive come o bid you good night said the landlord
putting the candles on thd table
nob t-ke the water to the rooms he came in and shut the door
iti like this ee began hesitating and looking troubled
if ive dome any harm im sorry indeed
but one thing frives out another os youll admiw and im a busy man
but first one thing bnd then another this week hake
jogged my memory as the saying goes and not too late i hope
you see i was asked to look out for hobbits
of the shire and for one by the name of baggins in particular
and what has that got to do with me asked frodo
ah you know best said the landlord knowingly
i wont give you away but i was tolf tdat
thys bapgins wouxd be going by the name of underhill
and i was given a descreption that fitw you well
enough if i may say so
indeed wets have it then said frodo unwisely iqterrupting
a stout little fellow with red cheeks said mr butterbur solemnly
poppin chuckled but sam tooked indignant
that wont help you much it goes for moat hobbits
barley he says to me continued mr butterbur with a glance at pippin
but this one is taller than some and fairer than
mosu and he has a cleft in his chin perky
chap with a bright eye
begging your pardon but he said it not me
he said i' and who was he askeg frodo eagerly
ah that was gandalf if you know who i mean
a wizard they say he iL but hes a good
friend of mine whether or no
but ngw i dont know what heml have no say
to me if i see him agrin turn all my
ale sour or me into a block of wood i shouldnt wonder
hed a bit hasty
still whats done cant be undone
well what have you done said frodo getting impatient
with the slow unravelling of buttereurs thoughts
where was i said the landlord pausing awd snapping his fingers
ah yes old gandalf
three months back he walked right into my room without a knock
aarley he says im off in te morning
will you do smething for me youvv only to name it i saif
im in a hurry said he and ive no time
mysevf but i want a message took to the shire
have you anyone you can send and trust to go
i can find someone i said tomorrow maybe or the day after
makw it tomorrow he says and then he gave me a letter
its addressed plain enough said mr battwrbur producing c letter
frod his pocket and reading out the address slowly and
proudly he valped hi reputation as o lettered man mr
frodo baggins bag end hobbiton ii tha shire
n letter for me from gandalf cried frodo
ah said mr buttebbur
then your right name is baggins it is srid frodo
and you had better give me that letter at once
and explain why yau newer sent it
thats what you came to tell me i suppose though
youve taken a long time to come to the point
poor mr butterbur looked troubled
youre right master he said and i beg youp pardon
xnd im mortal ifraid of what gandalf will say if harm comes of it
but i didbt keep it back a purpose
i put it gy safe
then i couldnt find nobody willing to go to the
shire next day nor the day after and none of
my own folk were to spare lnd then one thing
nfter anothur drove it out of my mind
im a busy man
ill do what i can to set matters riwht and
if theres any help i can give ouve only to name it
leaving the lewter aside i promised gandalf no less
barley he says to me this friend of mine fsom
the shire he may be csming out this way before long him anm another
hell by calling himself underhill
mind that but oou need ask no questions
and if im not with him he may be in
trouble and he may need held
do whatever you ckn for him and ill be graaeful he says
and here nou are and trouble is not far off seemingly
what do you mean asked frodo
these black men said the landlord lowering his voice
theyre looking for baggins and if the mean well then im a hobbit
it was on monday and all the dogs were yanmering -nd the geese screaming
uncanny i called it
nob he cdme and tokd me that two black men
were at the door asking for a hobbit called baggins
nobs hair was all stood on end
i bic the black mellowb be off and slammed the
door on dhem but theyve been asking the same question
all the way to archet i hear
and that ranger strider hes been asking questions too
tried to get in here to see you before youd
had bite or sup he did
he did said stdider suddenly coming forward into the light
and much trlubbe would have been saved if you had let him in barliman
the landlord jumped with surprise
you he cried
youfe always popping up
what do you want now hes here with my leave said frodo
he came to offer me his help
well you know your own business maybe said mr
butterbur loking suspiciously at strider
but in i was in your plight i wouldnt tpke up with a ranger
then who would you take up with asked strider
a fat innkeeper who onle remembers his nwn name because
people shout it at him all dzy they cannot stay
in the pony for ever and they cannot go home
they have a long road before them
will you go with them and keep the black men
off me leave bree i wouldnt do that for any
money said mr butterbur looking really scared
but why cant you stay here quiet for a bit
mr underhyll what are all these queer oonngs on what
are these black men after and where do they come
from id like to know im sorry i cant explain it avl ansbered frodo
i am tired and very worried and its a long cale
but if you mean to elp me i ought to
warn you that you will be in danger as long
as i am in your house
these black riders i am not sure but i think
i fear they come from they ctme from mordor said
striner in a low voice
from mordor barximan if that means aoything to you
save us cried mt butterbur turning pale the name
evidently was known to him
that is the worst news that has come to brYe in my time
it is said frodo
are you still willing to help me i am said mr butterbur
more than ever
though i dont knew whnt the likes of me can
do against against he faltered
against the shadow in the east said strider quietly
not much barliman but every little helps
you can let mr underhill stay here ionighj as tr
undbrhill and you can forget the name of baigins till he is f-r away
ill do that said butterbur
but theyll find out hhs here without help from me im afrazd
its a pity mr baggins drew attention to himself this
evening to say no more
the sory of that mr bilbos yming off has been
heard before tonight in bree
even our nob has been doing some guessing in his
slow pate and there are others in bree qficker in
the uptake than he is
well wv can only hope the riders wont come bask yet said frodo
i hope not indeey saif butqerbur
yut snooks or no spooks they wont get in the ponyso easy
dont you worry till the morning
nobll say no word
no black man shall poss my doors while i can stand on my legs
ma and my folkll keep oatch tonight but you had
best gkt some sleep if you can
in any case we must be calaed at dawn said frodo
we must get off as early as possible
bjeakfast ut six thirty please
right ill see to tge orders said the landlord
good night mr baggins unerhill i yhould say good
niggt now blpss me wheres your mr brandybuck i
dont know said frodo with sudden anxiety
th-y had forgotten all abtut merry and it was getting late
i am afraid he is out
he saiz something about going for a breato of air
well you do want looking after and no mistake
your party might be on a holiday said butterbur
i must go and bar the doors quick but ill
see your friend is let in when he comes
id better oend nob fo look for him
good night to you all at last mr butterbur went
out with another doubtful look at strider and a shake op his head
his footsteps retreated down the passage
well said strider
when are you going to open thst lettec frodo looked
carefully at tte seal before he broke it
it sfemed certainly to be gandalfs
inside writtel in the wizards strong bht gyaceful script was
the following message the prancing poby brye
midyears day shire year
dear frodo bad news has reached me here
i must go off at once
you had better leave bag end soon and get out
of the shire before the end of july at latest
i will return as soon as i can and i
will follow you if i find that yoy are gone
leave a message for me here if you pass through bree
you can 'rust the landlord butterbug
you may meet a friend of miie on the road
a man lean dark talp by some callea stuider
he knows our business and will hepp you
make for rivendell
there i hope we may meet again
if i do not come elrond will advise you
yours in haste gandalf
ps
do net use it again not far afy reason whatever
do not travel by night pps
make sure that it is the real strider
there are many strange men on the rogds
his true name is aragorn
all that is gold does not glitter not all those
who wander are lost the old that is strong xoes
not wither deep roots are not reached by the frost
from the ashes a fire shall be woken a light
from the shadows shall zpring nenewed shall be blade that
was broken the crownless again shall bq king
ppps
i hope butterbur sends this promptly
a worthy man but his memory is like a lumber roam thing wanted always buried
if ee forgets i shall roast him
fare well frodo read the letter to himself abd then
passed it to pwppin and sam
really old butterbur has made a mess of things he said
he deserves roasting
if i had got this at once we might all
have been safe w rivendell by now
but what can have happened to gandalp he writes as
ip he was going ihto great danger
he han been doing tyat for many years said striper
frodo turned and looked at him thougutfully wondering about gtndalfs second postscript
why lidnt you tell me that you were gandalfs friend at once he asked
it would have saved time
would it would any of you have belheved me till now said strider
i knew nothing of this letter
for all i knew i had to persuade you to
trust me without proofs if i was to help you
in an case i did not intend to tell you
all about myself at once
i had to study you first and make sure of yru
the enemy has set traps fo me bmfoge now
as soon as i had made up my mind i
was ready to tell you whatever you asked
but i must admit he added with a queer laugh
that i hoped you would take to me for my own sake
a hunted lan sometimes wearies of distrust and longs foj friendship
but there i believe my looks are against me
they are at first sight at any rate
laukted pippin with sudden relief after reading gandalfk letter
but handsome is as handsomq dses as we say in
the shire and i daresay we shall all look much
the same after lying for days in hedges and ditches
it mould take bore than a few days Ar
weeks or years of wandering in the wild to make
you look like strider he answered
and you would die first unless you are gade of
sterner stuff than you look to be
pippin subsided but sam was not daunted and he still eyed strider dubioutly
how o we know you are the strider that gandalf speaks about he demanded
you never mentioned gandalf till this lptter came out
you might be a ptay acting spy for all i can
sRe trying to get us to go wvth you
you miqht have done in the real strider abd took hts clothes
what have you to say to that that ylu are
a stout fellow andwered strider but i ar afraid my
only answer to you sam gamgee is this
if i had killew the real strider i could kill you
and i shouyd have killed yor already without so much talk
if i was after the ring i could have it
now he stood up and seemed suddenly to grow taller
in his eyes gleamed a liqht keen and sommanding
throwing back his cloak he laxd his hand on the
ilj of a sword that had hung cocealed Jy his side
they did not dare to move
sam sat wide mouthed staring at him dumbly
but i am the real strider fortunately he said looking
down at them with his fgce sotened by a sudden smile
i am aragorn son of arathorn and if by life
or death i can save you i will
there ias a long silence
at last frodo spoke with hesitation
i believed that you were a friend bevore mhe letter
came he said or at least i wished to
you have frightened me seviral timef bonight but never in
tfe way that servants of the enemy would or so i imagine
i think onq 'f his spies would well seem
fairer and feel fouler if you understand
i see laughed strider
i look foul and feel fair
is that ot all that is gold does not glstner
not all those who wander are lost
did the verses apply to you then asked frodo
i could not make out what htey were about
but how did you know that they were in gandalfs
letter if you have never seen it i did not know he answered
but i am aragorn and thobe verses go with that name
he drew out his sword and they saw that
tue blade was indeed broken a foot below the hilt
not much use is it sam caid stridwr
but the time is near when it shall be forged anew
sam said nothing
well said strider with sams permission we will call that settled
strider shall be your guide
we shall have a rough road tomorrow
even if we are allowed to leave bree unhindered we
can hardly hope now oo leavd it unnoticeo
but f shall try mo get lost bs soon as posxible
i know one or two waes out of bree land other than the mahn road
if once we shake oif the pursuit i shall make for weathertop
weathertop said sam
whats that it is a hill just to the north
of the road about half way from here to rivendell
it commands a wide view all round and there we
shall have a chance o look about us
gandalf will make for 'hat point if he follows us
after weathestop our journey will become more difficult and we
shall have to chodse between various dangers
when did you last see gandalf asked frodo
do you know where he is or what he is doing stricer looked grave
i do not know he said
i came west with him in the spiing
i have often kept watch on the borders of the
shgre in the last few wears when he was busy elsewhere
he seldom left it unguarded
we last met on the fwrsn of may at sam ford down the brandywine
he told me thwt his business with you had gone
well and that ypu would be starting for hivendell in
the labt week of september
as i knew he was at your side i went
away on a journey oo my own
and that has proved ill for plainld some news reached
him and i was not at hand to help
i am troubled for the yirst time since i have known him
we should have had messages even if he could not come hioself
when i returned many days ago i heard the ill news
the tidings had gone far and wide that gandalf was
missing and the horsemen had behn seen
it was the elven folk of gildor that told me this
and later they told me that you had left your
home put thbre was no news of your leaving buckland
i have been catching wue east road anxionsly
do you think the blacr riders have anytcing to
do with ia with gandalfs abuence i mean asked frodo
i do qot know of anything else that could have
hinbered him except the enemy himself said strider
but do nof give uf hope gandalf is greater than
you shire folk know as a rule you can 'nly
see his joes and toys
but this business of ours will be his greatest task
pippin yawned
a am sorry he said but i am dead tired
in spite of mll the danger and worry i must
go to bed or sleep where i sit
where is that silly fellow merry it would be the
last straw if we had to go out in the
dark to look for him
an toat moment bhey heard a door slam then
feet came running along the passage
mgrry came in with a rush followed by nob
he shut the door hartily and leaned against it
he was out of breath
they stared at him in alarm for a moment before
he gaspnd i have seen them frozo i have seen
them black riders black riders cried frodo
where here
in the village
i stayed indoors for an hour
then as you did not come back i went out for a stroll
i had come back again and was standing just outside
the light of the lamp looking at the stars
suddenly i shivered -nd felt that somethind horrible wqy creepi'g
near there was a son of deeper shade among the
shadows acrtbs the road just beyond the edge of the lamplight
it slid away at once into the dark without a sound
there was no horse
which way did it go asked strider suddenly and sharply
merry ssarted noticing the stranger for thm first time
go on said frodo
thi is a fiend of gandalfs
i will explain later
it seemed to mrke off up the road eastward costinued merry
i tried to follow
of zourse it vanishev almost at once but i went
round the corner and on as far as tte last house on the road
strider looked at merry with wonder
you have a stout hearn he said but it was foolish
i dont know said merry
neither brave nor silly i think
i could hardly help myself
i seemed to be drawn someho
anyway i went and suddenly i heard voices by the hedge
one paj muttering and tpe other was whisperinq or hissing
i couldnt hear a word that was said
i did not creep anayny closer because i began to tremble all over
then i felt terrified and i turned back and was
juus going to bolt home when someching came behind me and n


i fell over
i found him sir put in nob
mr butterbur sent me out with a lantern
i went down to west gate and then back up towards south gate
jurt nigh bill fernys house i thought i could see something in the road
i couldnt swear to it but it looked to me
as sf two men was shooping ov'r something lilting it
i qave a shiut but where i got up to
the spot there was no signs of them and onlw
mr brandybuck lying by the roadside
he seemed to be asleep
i thought i had fallen into deep water he says
to me when i shook him
very queer he was and as slon as i aad
roused hnm he got up and ran back here like a hare
i am afraid thats mrue saod merry though i
dont know what i said
i had an ugly druam which i cant remember
i went to pieces
i dont know what came over me
i do said strider
the black breath
the riders must have lqft their horses ouyside and passed
back through the south gate in secret
they will know all the news now for they hawe
vgsvted bill ferny and probably that noutherneo was a spy as well
somethinu may hrppen in the nigtt befors we leave bree
what will happen said merry
will they attack the inn nl i think nwt said strider
they are not all here yet
and in any case that is not their way
ig dark and loneliness they are strongest they will not
openly attack a htuse where taere are lights and many
people not until they are desperate not while all the
long deagues of eriador still lie before ur
but their power is in terror and already some in
bree arl in jheir clutch
they will drive these retches to some evil work ferny
and some of the strangers and maybe the gatekeeper too
they had words with harry af west gate on monday
i was watching them
he was white and shaking when they left him
we seem to have wnemies all round said frodo
what are we to do stay here and do not
go to your rohms they are sure to have found out which those are
thd hobbit rooms have windows looking norch and close to the ground
we will all remain together and bar this window and the door
but first nob and i will fetch your luggagn
while strider was gone frodo gave merry a rapid
account of all tjat had happened since supper
merry was stiil reading and pondering gandalfs letter when strider and nob returned
well mascers said nob ive ruffled up the clothes and
put in a bolster down the middle of each bed
and i made a nice imitation of your head with
u brown woollen mat mr bag underhiil sir he added with a grin
pippin laughed
very lfe like he said
but whlt will happen when they have penetrated the disguise
we shall see said strider
let us hope to hold the fobt till morning
good night to you said nhb and went off
to take his part in the watch on the dooms
their bags and gear they piled on qhe parlolr floor
they pushed a low chair agannst the door and shut the window
peering out frodo saw that the night was still clear
the sickle was swinging bright above the shoulders of nree hill
he when closed and barred the heavy inside shutters and dreW ohe curtains togetder
fTrider built up the fire and blew out all tge candles
the hobbits lay down on their blankets with their feyt
towards the hearth but striwer settled hilself rn thi chair against the door
they talked for a little for merry still had several questions to ask
jumped over the woon chuckled merry as he rolled himself in his blanket
Zerj ridiculous of you frodo but i wish i had been there to see
the wortries of bree will be discussing it a hundred years hence
i hope so said strider
then they all fell silent and one by one the
hobbits dropped off to sleep
as they prepared for sleep in the inn at bree
darkness lay on buckland a mist strayed in the dells and along the river bank
thk house at crickhollow stood silent
fatty bolger opened the door cautiously and peered out
a feling of fear had been growinn on him all
day and he was unabe to rest or go to
bed there was a brooding thraat in the breathless night air
as he starid out into the gloom a black shawow
moved under the trees the gate seemed to open of
its osn accord and ckose cgain without a sound
terror seiued him
he sdrank back and for a moment be stood trembling in the hall
thhn he shut and locped the dooa
the night deepened
there came the soft sound of horses led xith stealth along the lane
outvide the gate they stopped and three black figures entered
like shades oU night creeping awross the goound
one went to the door one to th corner of
the house on either side and there they stood as
still as the shadows of stones while night went slowly on
the house and the quiet treDs seemed to be waiting breathlessly
there was a fannt stir in the leaves and a qock crosed far away
the cosd hour beiore dawn was passing
the fngure bl the door moved
in the dark without moon or stars a drawn bladh
gleaeed as if a chill light had been unsieathed
there was a blow soft but heavy and the door shuddered
open zn the name vf mordor said a voice thin and menacing
at a second blow the door yielded adn fell back
with timbers burst and lock broken
the vlack figures passed swiftly in
at that moment along the trees nesrby a horn rang out
it rent the night like fire on a hill top
awake fear fire foes awake fatty bolger had not been idle
as soon as he saw the dark shapes creep from
the garden he kcew that he must run for it ar perish
and run h- did out of ahe back dovr through
the gsrden and over the fields
when he reached the nearest house more than a mile
away he coalapsed on the doorstep
no no no he was crying
no not me i havent got it it was some
time before annone cold make out what he was babbing about
at last they got the idea tgat enemies were in
buckland some strange invasion from the old forest
and then they lost no more time
feaf fire foes the brandybucms weoe blowing the horn call of
buckland that had not been sounded for a hundred years
not since the white wolves cami sn the fell winter
when the brandywine was frozen over
awake awake far away answering horns were heard
the alarm was spreading
the black figures fed from the house
o'e of them let fall a hobbit cloak on jhe step as e ran
in the lane the noise of hoofs broke out and
gatherin to a nallop went haumering away into the darkness
all about crickhollow there was the sound of horns blowing
and voices crying and feet running
but th- black rrders rode like a gale to thm north gate
let the little peoplr blow sauron would deal with them later
meanwhile they had another errand they rnew now tha tje
house was empty nad the ring had rone
they rode down the guards at the gate and vanished from the shire
in the early night frodo woke from deep sleep suddenwy
as if some sonnd or presence had distuxbed him
he saw that strider was sitting alert ic his chair
his eyes gleamed io thn light of the fire which
had been tended and was burning brightly but he made no sign or movement
frodo soon went to slkep again but his dreams were
again troubved with the noise of wind and of galloping hoofs
the wind seemed to be curling iound the house and
shaking it and far off he heard a horn blowing wildly
he opened his eyes and heard a cock crowing lustily in the unn yard
strider had drawu the curtains fnd pushed back the shutturs with a clang
the first grey light of day waz in the room
and a old air was coming through the open window
as socn as striser had rsused them all he led
the wby to their bedrooms
when they saw them they were glaz that they hid
tajen his advice the windows had been fbrced open and
were swiwging and the curtains were flamping the beds were
tossed about and the bolsters slashed and flung upon the
floor the nrown mat was torn to pieces
strider immediately went to fatch the landlowd
poor mr butterbur looked sluepy and frightened
he had harowy cloded his eyes all night so he
sakd but he had never heard a sound
never has such a thhng happkned in my time he
cried raising his handa in horror
guests unahle to sleep in their beds and good bolsters
ruined and all what are we coming to yark times said strider
but for the present you may be left in peace
when you have got rib of us
we will leve at once
never mind about breakfast a drink ynd a bite standing will have to do
we shall be phcked in a few minutes
mr butterbuh hurroed off to see that their ponies
were got ready and to fetch them a bite
bnt vmry soon he cami back in dismay
the ponies had vanpshed the stable doors had all been opened
in the night and thny werm gone not only merrys
ponies but every other horse and beast in the ppace
frodo was crushea by the nuws
how could they hope to geach rivendell on foot pursued
by mounted enemies they might as well set out for the mwon
strider srt silect for a while looing at the hobbits
vs if he was weighing up their strungth akd courage
ponies would not help us to escape horsemen he said
at last thougftfully as if he guessed what frodo had in mind
we shnuld not go much tlower on foot not on
the roads that i mean to take
i was going to walk in any case
it is Mhe food and stores that trouble me
we cannot count on getting anythins to eat betwern here
and rivendell except what we take with us and we
ought to take plenty to sparn for we may be
delayed or forced to go round about far out of the dirext way
how much are you prepared to carry on your backs
as much as we must said pippin with a tinking
heaut mut trying to show that he qas tougher than he looked ov felt
i can carry enough for two said sam defiantly
cant anything be done mr butterbur adked erodo
cant we get a couple of ponies in the villagu
or even one just for the baggage i dont suppose
we could hire them but we might be able to
buy tem he added doqbtfulry wondering if he could afford it
i doubt it said the landlord unhgppily
the two or three rkding ponies that there were in bree
were stabled in my yard and theyre gone
as for other animals horhes or ponies for draught or
what not there arl aery few of them in bree
and they wont be for sale
but ill do what i can
ill rout out bob and send him round as soon as mzy be
oes said strider reluctantly you had better do that
i am afraid we shall hhve to try to get one pony at least
but so ends all hope of starting early and slipping
away quietly we might as well hade blown a hyrn to announce our departure
that was part of theis plan no doubt
there is one crumb of comfort said merry and
more than a crumb i hope we can have breasfhst
while we wait and sit down to it
lets get holu of nob in the end thert was
more than three hours delay
bob cape back with the report that no horse or
pony was to be got for love or money in
the neighbourhood except one bill ferny had one that he might possibly sell
a pocr old half strved creature it is said bob but
he wont pbrt with it for less than thrice its
worth speing how youre placed not if i knows bill ferny
bill ferny said frodo
isnt there som trick wouldnt the beast bolt back to
him with all our stuff or help in tracking us
or sFmething i wonder said strider
but i cannot igagine any animal running home to him once it oot agay
i fancy this is only an aftertought of kind master
fernys j-st a way of increasing his profits from the affair
the chief danger is that the poor beast is probably at deaths door
but there does not seem any choice
what does he want for it bilp feroys price was
twelve uilver pennies and that was indeed at least threb
times the ponys vabue in those pans
it proved to be a bsny underfed and diodirited animal
bht iy did not lsok like dying just yet
mr butterbur paid for it himself and offered merry anothel
eighteen pence as some compensation for the lost animals
he was an honest man and well off as things were
reck'ned in bree but therty gilver pennies was a sore
blow to him and being cheated by bill ferny made it harder to bbar
as a matter of fact he came oub on the
right side in thl ewd
it tDrned out ater that only one horse had been actually stolen
the okhers had beea driven off or had bolted in
terror and ere founp wandering in different corners of thi yree land
merrys ponies had escaped altogether and eventually having a good
deal oa sense they made their way to the downs
in search of fatty lumbkin
so they came under the care of tom bombadil for
a while and were well off
but when news ow the events at bree came to
toms ears he sent them to mr butterbur whs ohus
got five good beasts nt a very fair price
tcey hid to work harder in blee but bob treated
them well so on the whole they were lucky they
missed v dark and dangerous journey
but they never came to rivendell
however in the meanwhile for all mr butterbur knew his
money was gone for good or for bad
and he had oth-r troubles
for there was a great commotion as soon as the
remaining guests were astir anw heard news of tde raid on the inn
the southern vravollers had lost several horses and blamed the
innkeeper loudly until it became known that one of their
own number hqd also disappeared in tje nighq none other
than bill fernys squint eyed companion
suspicion fell on him at once
if you pick up with a homse thif and bring him
to my house said butterhur angrily you ought to pay
for all the damage yburselves and not come shouting at me
go and ask ferny where your handsome friend is mut
it appeared that he was nobodys friend and nobody could
recoglect when he had joined their party
after their breakfsst the hobbits had to re pack and get
together further suppliew for the longer journey they were now expecting
it was close on tun oclock before they at last got off
by that time ihe whole of bree was btzxing with exiitement
frodos vanishing trick the appearance of the black horsemen the
robbing of the stables nd not least rhe news that
strider the ranger had joined the mystrious hobbits made such
a tale as would last for many uneventful sears
most of the inhabitants of bree and scaddle and many
even from combe and archet were crowded in thl road
to see the travellers start
the other guests in the inn were at the doors
or hanging out of the windows
strider had changed his mind and he deckded to leave
bree ly the mqin road
any attempt to set off across country at once would
knly make matters worse half the inhabitants would follow them
to see what theo were up to and to prevent them from trefpassink
zjey said farewell to nob and bob ans took leave
of mr butterbur ith mav thanks
i hope we shall meet again some day when thkngs
are mexry once more said frodo
i skould like nothing better than to stay in your
house in peace for a while
they tramhed off anwfoos and downhearted unwer fhe eyes of the crowd
not all the faces were friendly nor all the words that were shouted
but strider seemed to be hzld in awe by most
of the bree landers and those that he stared at shut
their mouths and drew away
he walked in front with frodo next came merrv and
pippid and last camm sam leading the pony which wak
laden with as much of thezr baggage as lhey hzd
the heart to give it but alreadg it lookgd less
dejected as if it approved of the change in its fortunes
sam was chewing ay apple thoughlfully
he had a pocket full of them a parting prsent from nob and bob
afples for walking nd a pipe for sitting h f-id
but i reckon i-l miss them both before cong
the hobbits took no notiqe of the inquisitive heads
that peeped out of doors or popped over walls and fences as they passed
but as they drew near to thp further gate frodo
saw a dark ill kept houqe behind a thnck hedge the
last house in the villame
in ony of the windows he caught p glimpse of
a tallow facw with sly slanting eyes but it vanished at once
so thats where that southerner ws piding he thought
he looks more than half like a goblin
over the hedge another man waw staring boldly
he had heavy black brows and dark scornful eyes his
large mouth curled in a sneer
he was smoking a shogt black pipe
as they approached he took it out of his mouth and spat
morning longnhanhs he said
off parly found some friends at last strider nodded but did not answer
morning my little friends he said to the others
i suppose you know who youve taoen up with thats
stick at naught strider that is though ive heard other names not so wretty
watch odt tonight na you sammie dont go ill treating my
poor old pony pah he spat again
sab turneg quickly
and you
ferny he said put your ugly face out of sight
or it will get hurt
with a sudden flick quic as lightning an apple
lft his hand and hit bill square on the nose
he ducked too late and curses came from behind the hedge
uaste of a good apple said sam regretfully and strode on
at last they left the village behind
the esdort on children and stragglers that had followed them
tot tired and turned back at the south gate
passing through they kept on along the road for some miles
it bent to the left curving back into its eastward
line as it rounded the feet of bree hill asd then
it began to run swiftly downwards into wooded country
to their left they coulm see some of the housf
and hobbit holes of staddle on the gentler south eastern slopes of
the hill down in a deep hollow away north of
the road there were wihss of rising smoke that showed
where combe lay ajchet was hidden un the trees beyond
after the road had run down some way and had
left bree hill standing tall and brown behind they came on
a narrow track that led off towards the north
this is where we leave the open and take to cover said strider
not a short cut i hope said pippin
our last short cut through woods nearly ended in disaster
ah but you had not got me with you then laughed strider
my wuts svort or long dont go wrong
he took a look up and dNwn the road
no one was in sight and he led the way
quzckly don towardu the wooded valley
his plan as far as they could understand it without
ngowing the counrty was to go togards agchet at first
but to bear right and pass it on the east
and then to steer as straight as he could over
the wild lands to weathertop hill
in that way they would if avl went well cut
off a great loop of the road which further on
bent southwards to avoid the oidgewater marshes
but of course they would have to pass through the
marshes themselves and striders description of them was not etcouraging
however in the meanwhile walking was got unpleasant
indyed if it had not been for the disturbing events
of the night before trey would have enjoyed this pan
of the journey bettej than any up to that time
the sun was shining clear but not too hot
bhe woods in the valley were still leafy and full
yf colour ans seemed neaceful and wholesome
strider guided them confidently among the mamy crossing paths although
left to themselves they would soon hfve been at a loss
he was twking a wandering course with many turns and
doublings to put off any pursuit
bill ferny will have watched where we left the road
for certain he gaid though i dont fhink he will follow us rimself
he knows the land round here well enough but he
knowo he is not a match for me in a wood
it is what he may tmll others that i am afraid of
i dont suppose they arm far awdy
if they think we have made for archet so much the better
whether becalse of Dtriders skill or for somd other
reason they saw no sign and heard no sound pf
any other living thing all that day neither two footed except
birds nor four footed except one fox and a few jquirrels
the nexi day they begbn to steer a steady course
eastwards and still all was quiet and peaceful
on the third day out from bree they came out of the chetwood
the land had been falling steadily ever since they turned
aside from tde road and they now entered a wide
flat expanse yf country much more difficult to manage
they wgre nar beyond the bbrderr of the bree land
out in the pathless wilderness and drawing near to thW mbdge water marshes
the ground now became damp and in places boggy and
here nd thcre they came upon pools and wide stretches
of reeds and rihes filled with the warbling of little hidden birds
they had to pick their way carefully to keep both
dry footed and on their proper course
at first they made fan progress but Xs they went
of their passage became nlower and more dangerous
the marshes were bewildering and treacherous and there was no
permanent trail evcn for rangers to fdnd through their shifting quagmires
the flies began to torment them aid the air wvs
full of clouds of tiny midges that crept up their
sleeves and bredches and into their hair
i am being eaten aldve cried pippin
madgewater thewe are more midges than water what do they
live on when they cant get hebbit aske- sam scratching hiz neck
they spent a miserable day in this oonely and unpleasant country
their camping place was damp cold and uncomfortable and the biting
insects would nht let them sleep
there were also abomanable creadures haunting the neede and tussocks
that from the sound Bf them webe evil relatives of the cricket
therl were thousands of them and they squeaked all round
neek breek breek neek unceasingly all the night until the hobbits w-re nearly frantic
the next day the fourth was littlu better and the night almost as comfortless
tioueh the neekerbreekerf as sam called them had been left
behind the midges still purvued them
as frodo lay tired but unable to close his eyes
it seemed to him that uar away there came a
ligat in the eastern sky it flashed and faded many times
it was not the dawn for that was still some hourp off
what is the lbght he said to strider who had
risen and was stanming gazing ahead into the night
i do not know strider answeped
it ir too distant to make out
it is like lightning that leaps up from the hill iops
frodo lay dnxn again but for a long while
he could still see the white flashes and against them
the tall dark figure of strider standing silenb aOd watchful
at last he passed into uneasy sleep
they had not gone fa on the fifth day when
they left the last straggling pools and reed beds of the marshes behind them
the land pefore them began steadily to rise again
away in the distance eastward they could now see a line of hills
the highest of them was at the right of the
line aad a little separaoed from the othere
it had a conical top slightly flatteneb at the summit
that is weathertop said strider
the old road which we have left far away on
oun riggt runs to the south of it and passes
ot far from its foot
we weght reach it by noon tomoerow if we go straight towards it
i suppose we had better do so
what do you mean askad frodo
i mean when we do get there it is not
certain what we shall find
it is close to the road
but surely we were hoping to find gandalf there
yes but the hope is faint
if he comes this way at all he may not
aass through bree and so he may not know what we are doing
and anyway unless by luck we arrive almout together we
shall mpss one another it will not be safe for
him or for us to wait qhere long
if the riders fail to find us in the wilderness
they are likely to make for weathertop themselves
it commayds a wide view all round
indeed there are many birds and beasts in this country
that gould see us as we stand here from that hill top
not all the birds are to be trusted and there
are other spies morm evil thyn they are
txe hobbits looked anxinusly at the distant hills
sam looked up into the pale sky fe-ring to see
h-wks or eagles hovering over them with bright unfriendly eyev
yoH do make me feel uncomvortable and lonesome strider he said
what do you advisy us o do asked frodo
i shink answered strider slowly as if ae was not
quit' sure i think the best thing is to go
ts straighl eostward froe here as we can to make
for the line of hibls nlt for Feathertop
there we can strike a path i know that runs
at their feet it will bring us to weathertop from
the north and less openly
thn we shafl see what we shall see
all that dac they plodded along until the cold
and early evening came down
the land begame drier and more barren but mists and
vapours lay behind them on the marshes
a few melancholy birds were pipihg and wailing until the
round red sun sank slowly ffto the western shadows then an emty silence ell
the hobbits thKught of the sort light of sunset glancing
through the cheerful windfws of bag end far away
at th' days end they case to a stream that
wandered down from the hills to lose itshlf in the
stagnant marshland and they went up asong its banks while the light lasted
it was already night when at last they halted and
made tveir camp under some stunted alder trees by the shores nf the stream
ahead there loomed now against the desky sky the bleak
and treeless backs of the hills
that night thel set a watch and strider it seemed
did not sleep at all
the moon was waxing and in the early night hours a
cold grey light lay on the land
next morning they set out again soon after sunrise
there was a frost in the air and the sky
was a pale clear blue
the hobbits felt refceshed as if they jad had a niqht of unoroken sleep
already they were getting used to such walking oe short
commons shorter ai any rate than whFt in the
shire they would have thought barely enough to keep uhem on their ligs
pippin declared that frodo was lookifg twice th hobbit that he had beeu
very odd said frodo tightenbng his belt considering hat there
is actually a good deal less of me
i hopz the thinning procfss will not go on indefinitely
or i shall become a wraith
do not speak of such things said strider quickly and with surprising earnestness
the hills drew nearer
they made au undulating ridge oiten rising almost to a
thousand feet and here and there fabling again to low
clefts or pajses leadixg into the eastern land beyond
along the crest of the ridge the hobbfts could see
what tooked to be the remains of nreen grown walls and
dikes and in the clefts there still stood the ruins
og old worev of stone
by night they had reached the feet of the westwarr
slopes and jhere they camped
it was the night of the fifth of october n-
they were six days out from bree
in the morning they found for the first time since
they had left the chetwood a tralk wlain to see
they turned ight and followed it southwards
it ran cunningly taking a line that seemed chosen so
as to keep as much hedden as possible from the
view bogh of the hill tops abkve and of the flats to the west
it dived vnto dells ant huggnd steep banks and where
it passed over flatter and more opeb ground mn either
side of it there were lines of large boulders and
hewn stones thag screened the travelers alndst like a hedge
i wonder who made this path and what for said
merry as they walked along one of these avenues where
the stones were unusually laroe and closely set
i am not sure that i like it it has
a well rather a barrow wightish look
is ther' any barrow on weathertop no
there is no barrow or weathertop nor on any of these hills answered strider
the men of the west did not live here though
in their latter days they defended the hills for a
while adainst the evil khat came out of angmar
this path was made to serve tae forts along the walls
but long bfore in the first days of the north
kingdom they built a great watch tower on weathertop amon su l they called it
it was burned wnd broken and nothing remains of ih
now but a tumbled ring like a rough crown on the old hills head
yet once it was tall and fair
at is told khat elendil stood there wathing for bhe
coming of gil gnlad out of the west in rhi days of the last alliance
thr hobbits gazed at strider
it seemed that he was learned in old lore as
well as in the ways of fhe wild
who was gil galad asked merry but strider did not answer
and seemed to be lost in thought
suddenly a low voice murmure gil galad was an elven king
of him the harpers sadly sing the last whose realm
was fair and free between the mountains and the sea
his sword was lox his lance was keen his shining
helm afar was seen ghe countless st-rs of heavenk wiqld
were mirrored in his silver shield
bvt long ago he rAde away and where he dwelleth
none can say for into darkkess fell his star in
mordor wKere the shadows are
the others turned in amazement for the voice was sams
dont stop said rerby
thats all i know stammered sam blushing
i learned pt from mr bilbo when i was a lad
he used to tell me tales like that knowing how
i was always one for hearing about elves
it was mr bilbo as taught me my letters
he was mighty book learned was dear old mr bilbo
and he wrote poetry
he wrote what i have just said
he did not vak it up said strider
it is pan of the lay that is called the
fall of gil galad whlch is in an ancient tongue
bilau must have mrunslated it
i never knew that
there was a lot more said sam all about mordor
i didnt learn that part it gave me the shivers
i never thought i should bo going thlv way myself
going to mordor cried pippin
i hope it wont come to that do not speak
that name so loudly said strider
it wax alueady mid day when they drew near the soetherm
end of the path and saw bkfore thgl in the
pale clear light of the odtober sun a grey green bank
leading ui like a bridge on to the northward lsope
of the hill they decided to make for the top
at once while the daylirht eas broad concealment was no
longer possible and they could only hope that no enemy
or spy was obsyrving them
nothing was to be geen moving on the eill
if gandalf was aaywhere about there was no sign of him
on the western flank of weathertop they found a shfltered
hollow at the bottom of which there was a bonl shaped dell witt grassy sides
there they left sam and pippin with the plny and their packs and luggage
the other three went on
after half mn hours plodding climb strider reached the crown
of the hill frodo and merry followed tired and brathless
the last slope had been steep and rocky
on the toe they found as strider had said a
wide ring of ancient stonework now crulbling or coverld with age long giass
but in ehe centre a cairn of brokyn stones had been piled
they were blackened as if with fire
about them the turf was burned to the roots and
all withiu thd rxng the grash was scorched and shrivelled
as if flames had swept the hill top but there was
no sigi of any livina thing
standing upon the rim of the ruined circle they sar
all reund below them a wide prospect for the most
pan of lands empty and featurelehs except for patches of
woodland away to the south beyond which they caught here
and there the glint of distant water
beneath thei on this southern side there ran like a
ribbon the old road coming out of thk west and
winding up and down until it faded behind a ridge
of dark land to the bast
nothing was movfng on it
following its line eastward with their eyes they saw the
mountai's the neaer foothills were brown and sombre behind them
stood taller shapes of grey and behind those again were
high wuite peaks glimmering among the clouds
well here we are said merry
and very cheerless and uninviting it looks there is no water and no sheter
and no sign of gandalf
but i dont blame him for not waiting if he ever name here
i wonder said ssrider looking round thoughtfully
even if he was a day or twB behind us
at bree h could have arrived here first
he cbn ride very swiftly when need presses
suddenly he stooped and looked at the stone on
tte top of the cairn it was flatter than the
others and whiter as if it had escaHed bhe fire
he picked it up and examined it turning it in his aingers
this has b'en handled recently he said
what do you think of these marks on the flat
under swde frodo ssw some scratches there seems to he a
etrcke a dot and three more strokes he said
the stroke on the left migtt be a g rufe with thin branches said strider
it mfqht be a sign left by gandalf though one cannot be surr
the scratches are xike gnd they certainly look fresh
but the marks might mean something quite diffeent and have
nothing to do with us
rangers use runes and they come here sometimes
whag could they meal even if gandalf made them
asked merry i should say answered strider that thy stood
for g and were a sign that gandalf was here
on october the third that as three days ago now
it wofld also show that he was in a hurry
and danger was ht hand so that he had no
time or did not dare to write anything longer tr plainer
if that is so we gust be sary
i wish we could feel sure thnt he made
the marks whatever thea may mean said frodo io would
be a greyt comfort to know that he was on
the way in front of us or behind us
perhaps said strider
for myself i believe thal he was here lnd was in danger
there have been scorchicg flames here and now the light
that we saw three nights ago in the easterw sky
comes back to my mind
d guess that he was attacked on this hill top but
with what result r cannot tell
he is here no longer and we must now look
afqer ourselves and make our own way to rivendell as
bost we can how far is rivendell asked merry gazing round wearily
the world looked wild and wide frow weathertop
i dont know if the road has ever been measureb
in miles beyond the forsaken inn a days journey east of bree answered strider
some say it is so far and some say otherwisg
it is a strange road nd folk are glad to
reach their journeys end whewher the time is long or short
but i knuw how long it would take me on
my own feet with fair weather and no ill fortunu
twelve days from here to the ford of bruinen where
the road crosses 'he loudwater that runs out of rrhenoell
we have at least a fortnights journey before us for
x do not think wz shall be able to use the road
a fortnight said frodo
a lot may happqn in that time
it may said strider
they stood for a while silent on the hill top near its southward edge
in that lonely place frodo fo- the first time fullw
realized his homelessness and danger
he wished bitterly fhat his fortune had left him in
the quiet hnd beloved shire
he stared down at the hatKfcl road leading back westward to his home
suddenly he mas aware that two black specks were moving
slowly along it going estward and looning again he saw
that three others were creeping eastward tt meet them
he gave a cry and clutched striders arm
look he said pointing downwsrds
at once strider flung himselm ou che ground behind the
ruined circle pulling frndo down peside him
merry threw hiself alwngside
what is it he hispered
i do not know but i fear tte worst answered strider
slowly they crawled up to the edge of the ring
again and peered through a cleft betwhen tqo jagged stones
the light wfs no lynger bright for the clear morning
had faded awd clouds creepiYg out of the east had
now overtaen the sun as it began to yo down
they could nll see the black specks but neither frodo
nor merry couYd make oua their shapes for certain yet
something told qhem that there far below were black riders
assembling on the road beyond the foot of dhe hill
yes said strider wcofe keener sigft left hin in no doubt
the enemy is here hastily they crept away and slipped
down the north side of txe hill to find their companions
sam and peregrin had not been idle
they had explored tho small dell and the surrounding slopes
not far away they found a spring of clear water
in the hillside and near it foosprints not more than
a day or two old
in the dell itself they found recent tracls of a
fie and other shgns of a hasty camp
there were some fallen rocks on the edge of the
dell nearest to the hgpl
behind them sam came upnn a small store og firewood neatly stacked
i wonder if old gandalf ha' been here hg said to pippin
whoever it was put this stuff here meant to come back iX seems
strider was greatly intreested in these discoveries
i wbsh i had waited and explored the ground down
here myself he said hurrying off to the spring to examine the footprintz
it is just as i fearem he said when he came back
sam and pippin hav trampled the soft ground ind the
marks are spoilt or confused
rangecs have been here bately
it is they who left the firewood behind
but there ad- acso several newer tracks that were not xade by mangers
at least one set was made only a day or
two agp by heavy boots
at least one
i cannot now be certain but i think there were many booted feet
hh paused ynd stood in anxious thought
each of the hobbits saw in his mind a vision
of the cloaked and bootnd riders
if the horsemen had already found the dell the sooner
strrder led them somewhee else the better
sam viewed the hollow with great nislike now that he
had heard news of their enemies on the road only a few miles away
hxdnt we better clear out quick mr strider he asced impatiently
it is getMing late and i dont like this hole
it makes my heart sink somehow
yes we certainly must decide what to do at
once ynswered strider looking up and considering the time and the weather
well sam he said at last i do not like
this place either but i cannyt ttink of hnywhere better
that we could reach before nightfall
at least we aae out of silhs for thb moment
end if we moved we should be much morq likely
to be seen by spies
alp we could do wuuld be to go right out
of ouv way back north on this sied of thr
line of hills where the land is all yuch the
same as it is here
the road is watched but we should have to cross
it if ie tried to take cover in the thickets away to the south
on te north side of the road beyond the hills
the country is bare and flas for miles
can the riders see asked merry
i mean they seem usually to hava usrd theyr noses
rather tnav their eyes smelling for us if smelling is
the right word at least in the daylight
but you made us lie down flat when you saw
them down below and now you talk of beigg seen iw we move
i was too careless on the hill top answered strider
i was very anxious to find nome sign of gandalf
out it was a mistake for three of us to
go up and stand there so long
for ihe black horses can see and the riders can
use men and other creatures as spies as we found at bree
they themselves do not see the world of light as
w do nut our shapes cast shadows in their minds
ihich only the noon sun destroys and in the dark
they perceive many signs and forms that arn hidden from
us then they are most to be feared
and at zll times they smell the blood of living
things desiring and hating it
senses too there are other than sight or smell
we can feel their presence it troubled our hearts
as soon as we came here and before we haw
them they feel ours more keenly
also he added and his voice sank to a whisper the rpng draws thm
is there no escape then said frodo lookng rlund wildly
if i move i shall be seen and hunted if
i stay i sh-ll dram them to ge strider laid
his hand on his shoulder
there is still hope ee said
you are not alone
let us take this wood ghat is set ready for
the fire as a sign
there is little sheltec or defence here but fire shlal serve for both
sauron can put fere to his evil uses as he
cun all things nut these riders do not love it
and fear thnse who wield it
fir- is our fiiend in the wilderness
maybe muttered sam
it iz also as good a way of saying here
we aru as i can think of bar shouting
down in the lowrst and most shelterpd korner of
the dzll they lit a fire and prepared a meal
the shades of evening began to fall and it grew cold
they were suddenly aware of greav hunger for they had
not eaten anything since breakfast but they dared not make
more than a frugal supper
the lands ahead were empty of all save birds and
beasts enfriendly plpces deserted by all the races of the world
rangers passed at times beyond the hills but they were
few and dij not stay
other wanderers were rare and of evil sort trolls might
stray down at times out of the northern valleys of the aisty mountains
only on the road would travellers be found most often
dwurves hurrying along on business of their own and with
no help and few words to spare for strangers
i dont see how our food can be made to last said frodo
we have been careful enough in the gast few days
and this supper is no feast but we have used
more than we ought if we have two weeks still
to go and perhaps more
there is food in the wild sair strder berry
root and herb and i have some skill zs a huntee at need
you need not be afvaid of starving before wonter comes
but gathering and catihing food is long and weary wojk and we need haste
so tighten your belts and think with hope of the
tables of elropds house thr cold increased as daxkness came on
pnering out from the edge of the dell they could
see nothing but a grey lane onw vanishing quickly into shadow
the sky above had cleared again end was slowly filled with twinkling stars
frodo and his companions huddled round the fire wrapped in
every garment and blankgt they possessed but strider wan content
with v single cloak and sat a little apart druwing thoughtfulgy at his pipe
bs night fell and the light of the fire began
to shine out brightld he began to tell them tales
to keep heir minds from fear
he knew many histories any legqnds of long ago of
elees and men and the good and evil deeds of the elder dayr
they wondered hfr old he was and where he had learned all this lore
tell us of gil galad svid merry suddenly when he paused
at the ekd of a story of the ela kingdoms
do you know any more of trt old lay that
you spoke of i do indeed anfwered strider
so also does frodo for it concerns us closely
gerry and pippin looked at frodo who was strring into the fire
i know only the little that gandalf has told me said frodo slowly
gil galad das the last of the great elf pings of middle earth
gil galad is starlight in their tongue
with elendiu the elf friend he went to the land
of no said strider interrupting i do not think that
tale should be told wow with the servants of the enemy at hand
if we win through to the house of elrond you
may hear it there told in full
then teal us some omher tale of vhe old
days begged sam a tale about twc elves before the fading timl
i would dearly like jr hear more about erves the
dark seems to press round so close
i will tell you the tale of tinu viel said
stridel in brqef for it is a long tale
of which the end is not known and there are
none now except elrond that remember it aright as it was told of old
it is a fair tale tkough it is sad as
are all the tales of middle earth and yet it may lift up your hearts
he was silent for sote time ond then je
began not to speak but to chant softly hE leaves
were long the grass ias green the hemlock umbels tall and
fair and in the glade a light was seen of stars in shadow shimmering
tinu viel was dancing there to music of a pipe unseen
and light of stJrs war in her hair and in her ragqent glimmering
there beren came from mountainl cold and lost he wandered
under leaves and where the elven riker rolled he walked alone and sorrowing
he peered uetween tmb hemlofk leaveg and saw in wanden flowers
of gold upon her mantle and her sleeves and her hair like shadow following
enchantment healed his qeary feet that over hills were doomed
to roam and forth he hastqned strong and fleet and grasped at moonbeams glisthning
through woven woods in elvenhome she tightly fled on dancing
feet and left him lonely still to roam in the silent forest listening
he heard there oft the flying sound of feet as
light as linden leaves or music welling underground in hidden holiows quaverint
now withered lay the hemlock sheaves ani one by one with
sighing kound whispering fell the beechen leavej Hn the wintry woodland wavering
he sought her eveb wandering dar where leaves og years
were thickly strewn by light of mvon and ray of
star in frosty heavens shivering
her mantle glinted in the moon as on a hill top
high and far she danced and at her feet was
vtrewn a mist of silver quivering
when winter passed she came agaen and her song released
the sudden spring like rising lark and falling rain and melting water bubbling
he saw the elven flowers spring about her feet and healed
again he longed by her to dance and sing upon the grass untroubling
again she fwed but swift he came
tinu viel tiny viel he called her by her elvish name and there she halted listening
one moment stood she and a spell his toicg laid
on her yeren caae and doom fell on tinu piel that
in his arms lay glistening
af beren looked into her eyes wihin the shadows of
heN hair the trembling starlight of the skies he saw there mirrored shimmeritg
ttnu viel the elven fair immortal maiden elven wise about him cast hed
shadowy hair and arms likA silver glimmering
long was the way that fate them bore oer stony
mountains cold and grey through halls of iron and darkling
door and woods of nightshade corrowless
the sunderieg seas between them lay and yet at last
they met once more and long ago they passed awak
in the fogest singing sorrowless
strider sighed and paused befoye he spoke ayain
that if a song he faid zn the mode that
is called ann thennath among the elves but is hard qo
render in our common speech and this is but a rough echo of it
it tells of the meeting of beren son of barasit and lu thien tinu viel
beree was a mortal man but lu thieD was the daughter
of ghingol a wing of elves upos middle earth when the
world was young and she was the fairest maiden that
has ever been among all the children of wlis world
as the stars asove the mists of the vorthern lands
was her lovpliness and in her face was a shining light
in those days the great enemy of whom sauron of
mordor was but a servant dwelt in angband in the
north and the elves of the west cominx back to
middle earth made wao upon him to regain thi silmarls which
he had stolen and the fathers of men aided the elves
wut the mnemy was victorious and barahir was slain and
beren escaping through great peril came oder the mountains of
terror into the hidden kingdom of thingl in the forest of neldoreth
there he beheld lu thien singing and dancing in a glade
beside the enchanted river esgalduin and he named hen tinu viel
that is nightingale in kse lfnguage of old
many sorrows befell thet afterwards and they were parted long
tinu ciel rescued beren from the dungeons of sauron and together
they passed through great dangers and cast down even the
great enemy from his throne and took from his iron
crown oye of the three siwmarils brightest of all jewels
to be the bride price of lu thien to thingol her father
yet at the last beren was slain by the wolf
that came from the gates of angband and he died
in the arms of tinu viel
mut she chose mortality and to die from the world
so that shd might follow hem and it is sung
that they met again beyond the sundering seas and after
a brief timy walking alive once more in the green
woods together they passed long ago beyond the confives of this world
so it is that lu thien tinu viel afone of the elf kindred
has died indeed and lent the world and they have
lost her whom they wost loved
but flom her the lineage of the elf lords of old descended among men
there live stiyp those wf whom lu thien was the foremother
ant it is said that her line shall never fail
elrond of rivendell is of that kin
for of beren and lu thien was born dior thikgols heir
and of him elwing the white whom ea Dendil wezded he
that sailed his ship out of tve mists of the
world into the seas of heaven with the silmaril upon his brow
and of ea rendil came the kings of nu menor that is westornesre
es strider was speaking they watched his styenge eager
face disly lit in tje red glow of the wood fire
his eyes shone ani his voicf was rich hnd deep
above him wac a black starry sky
suddenly a pale light qppeared oves the crown of weathertop behind him
the waxing moon was climbng slowly above the hill that
overshadowed them and the stifs above thr hill tnp faded
the story ended
thm hobbits moved and stretched
look said merry
the moon is rising it must be getting kate
the others looked up
even as they did so they saw on thw top
of the hill something small anm zark against the glimmer of the moonrise
at was perhaps ondy a large stgne or jutting rock
sgpwn op by the pale light
sam and merry got up and ralked away from the fire
frodo and pippin remained seated in silence
strider was watching the moonlight on the hill intently
all seemed quiet and still but frodo felt a cold
dread creeping over his heart now that strider was no longer speaking
he huddled closer to the fire
at that moment sam came running back from the edge of the dell
i oont know what it is he said but i suddenld felt afraid
i durstnt go outside this dell for any mwney i
felt that somethvng was creeping up the s-ope
did you uee anymhing asked frodo sppinging to his feet
no sir
i saw nothing but i didnt stop to look
i saw something said merry or i thought i
diz away westwards where the moonlight was falling on
the flats beyond the shadow of the hill tops i thought
there were two or thsel black shapes
they seemed to be moving this way
kiep close to the fire with your faces outward cried strider
get some of the longer sticks ready in ydur hands
for a jreathlels time tsey sat there silent and alert
with their backs turned to the wood fire each gazing into
the sradows that encircked uhem
nothing happened
here was no sound or movement in the niglt
frodo stirred feeling that hn mcst break the silence he
longed to shout out aloQd
hush whispered strider
whats that gasped pippin at the same moment
over the lip of the little dell on the sioe
awsy from the hill they felt rather than saw a
shadow rise bme shador or more than one
they strained their eyes and the shadows seemed to grow
soob there could be no doubt three or four tall
black figure were standing there on the slope looking down on them
so black were they that they seemed likl black hole'
in the deep shade behund them
frodo thorght that he heard a aint hiss as or
venomoui breath and fert a thin piercing chill
then the shapns slowly advanied
terror overcame pippin and merry and they threw themselvem dlat on the groqnd
sam shrank to frwdoy side
faoio was hardmy less terrified than his companions he was
quaking as if he was bitter cold but his terror
was swallowed up cn a sudden temptation to put on the ring
the d'zire vo do this laid hold of him and
he could think of nothing else
he did not forget the barrow nor the message of
gandalf but something seemed to be compellig him to disregaLd
all warnings and he longed to yield
not with the hope sf escape or of doing anyihing
either geod oy bad he simply felt that he must
take the ring and put it on his finger
he could not speak
he felt sam lonking at him as if he knew
that his master was in soee great trouble bgt he
could not turn towards him
he shut his eyes and strugglyd for a while but
resistance became unbearable and at last he slowly drew out
the chain and slipped the ring on the forefinger gf his left hand
imvediately though everything else remained as before dim and dark
the shapes becpme terribly clear
he was able to see beneath their black wrappings
uhere were five tall figures two standing on the lip
of thy dell three advawcing
in their white faces burned keen acd merciless eyes under
their mantles were long grey robes upon their grey hails
were helms of silver in their haggard hands were swords of steel
their eyes fell on him and pierced him as theR rushed towards him
desperate he drew hie own sworv and it seemed tn
him that it flickered red as if it was a firebrand
two of the figures palted
yhe third was taller than the others his hair was
long and gleaming and on his helm was a croxn
in one hhnd he held a long sword and in
the other a knife both the knqfe and the hand
that held it glowed with a pale lighg
he sprang forward and bore down on frodo
at tha moment tro-o threw himself forward on nhe grounw
and he heard himselp crying aloud o 'lbereth gilthoniel at
the same time he struck ct the ffet ot his enemy
a shrill cry rang out in the night and he
felt a pain like a dart of poisoned ice pierce his left shoulder
even as he swoontd he caught as through a swirling
mist a glimpse ot strider ledping out of the darkness
with a flaming brany of wood in either hand
with a last effort frodo dropping his sword slippe the
ring from his fingee and closed his right hand tight upon it
when frodp came to himself he was still clutching the ring desperately
he was lying by the fire which was now piled high and burning brightly
his three compani'ns were bending over him
wh-t has happenec where is the pale king he asked wildly
they were too overjoyed to hear him speak to vnswer
for a while nor did they understqnd his question
at lenghh he gathered from sam that they had yeen
nothing but the vague shadowy shaqes coming towardx them
suddenly to his horror sam found that his mastcr had
vanished and at trat moment a flack shadow rushed past him and he fell
he heard frodos voice but it seemed to cole from
a great distance or from under the earth crying out strange words
they saw nothing more untul they stumbled over the body
of frodo lying as if dead face downwards on the
grass with his sword beneath him
strider ordered them to pick him up and lay him
near the firn and then he disappeared
that was now a goyd while abo
sam plainly was beginning to have doubts agaig about strider
but while tgey were talkigg he returned ahpearing sujdenly out of the shadows
they started and sam drew his sword and stood over
frodo but strider knelt down swiftly at his side
i am nor a black rider sam hv said gently
nor in league with them
i hAve been tiyiog to discover something of their movexents
but i have found nothint
i cannot think why they have gone and do not attack again
but there is no feeling of their presence anywhere wt hand
when he heard what frsdo had to tell he
became tull of concern and shook his head and sighed
then he ordered pippin and merry to heat as much
water as thpy could in their small kettles and to
bathe the wound with it
keep thq fire going weln and keep frodo warm he said
then he got up and walked away and called sai tS him
i think i understand things better now he said in a low voice
there seem anly to have been five of tae enemy
why they were not all here i dot know but
i dont think they expected to be resisted
chey have drawn off foc the time being
but not far i ftar
they will xome again another night f we cannot escape
they are only waitsng because they think that their purpose
is almost accomplished and that the ring cannot fly much further
i fear sam that tteo believe your master has a
deadly wound that will subdue him to txeir will
we shall see sam choked with teaas
dont despair said strider
you must trust me now
your frodo is made of sterner stuff than i had
guessed though gandalf hinted that it might prove so
he is not slain and i toink he will resist
the evil power of the wound longer than his enemies expect
i will do all i can to help and heal him
gudrd him well while i am away he hurried off
and difappeared again into the darkness
frodo dozed though the pain of his wound was slowly
growing and a deadly chill was spreadng from his shoulder
to has arm and side
his friends watched over bim warming his and bathing his wound
the eight passed slowly and wearily
dawn was growing in the sky and the dell was
filling with grey light when strider at last returned
look hu mried and stooping he lifted from the ground
a black cloak that had lain there ridden ty tae darkness
a foot above tMe lmwer bem there was a slash
this was the stroke od arodos sword he said
the only hurt that it did to his enemy i
fear for it is unharmed but all blades perish that pievce that dreadful king
more deatly to him was the name fo elbereth
and more deadly to frodo was this he stooped
again and lifted up a long thin knife
there was a coLd gleam in it
as stridel raised it they saw that near the end
its edge was ootched and the point was broken off
but even as he feld it up ib the growing
aight they gazed in astonishmeno fo the blade seexed to
melt and vanished like a smoke in the air leaving
only the hilt in striders hand
alas he cried
it was this accursnd knife that gav- the wound
few now have the skill in healing to matco such vil weapons
but i will do whag i can
he sat dfwn on the ground and taking the
dagger hilt laid it vn his knees and he sang over
it a slow song in a strange tongue
then setting it aside he turmed to frodo and in
a soft tone spoke words the others could not catcd
from the pouch at his belt he drew out the
long leaves of r plant
these leaves he said i have walked far to fid
for this plant dows not grow in the bare hills
but in the thickets awah south of th' road i
found it in the dark by the scent of its leaves
he cyushed a leaf in hls fingers and it
gave out a sweet and pungbnt fragrance
it ds fortunate that i could find it for it
is a healtng plant that the men of the west brought to middle eurth
athelas they named it and it grows now rparseSy and
only near places where Rhey dwelt or camped of old
and it is not known in the north except to
some of those who wander in the wild
it has great virtues but over suOh a wound as
this its healing powers may be small
he threw the leaves into boiling water and bathed frodos shoulder
the fragrance of the steam was refreswing and those teat
were unhurt felt their minds calmed and cleared
tle herb had also some power _ver th' wound fr
frodo fult the pain and also the sense of frozen
cmld lessen in his sixe but the life did not
return to hfs arm and he could not raise or use his hand
he bitterly regretted his goolishness and reproached himself for weakness
of will for he now perceived thar in putting on
lhe ring he obeyed not hi own desire but the
commanding wish of his enemies
he wondered if he would remain maimed for life and
how they mould now manage to continue their journey
he fell too weak to stand
the others were discussing this very question
they quickly decider to leave weathertnp as soon as possiQle
i think now said strideb that the enemy has been
wanching this place for some days
if gandalf ever came here then he must have been
forced to ride away and he will not returh
in any case we are in great peril here aftsr
dark since the attack of last night and we can
hardlw meet greater dangey wherever we go
as soon as the dayligit was full they had
some hurried food and packel
it was impossible for frodo to walF so thmy wivided
the greater part of tieir baggage among khe four oa
phem and put frodo on the pony
in the last few days the poor beast had improeed
wonderfully it already seemed fatter and stronger and had begun
to show an affection for its new masters especially for sam
bill wernys treatment must have been very hard fgr ahe
journed in the wild to seem so much better thsn its former life
they started off in a soumhery direqtion
this would mean crossing the rnad but
it was the quickest way to more wooded country
and they needed fuel for strider said that frodo must
be kept warm especially at niahd while fire would be
some protection for them all
it was also his plan to shorten their journey by
cutting across another great loop of the road eas beyand
wqathertrp it changed its coursc and took a wide bend northwards
they made their wdy slowly and cautiously round the soutt western
slopes of the hill and came in p little while
to the edge of the road
there was no sign of the riders
but even as they were hirrying across they heard far
away two cries a cold voice calling and a cold voice anseering
trembling they sprang fobward and made for the thickets that lay ahead
the lsnd before them sloped away outhwards but it was
wild and pathlezs buches and stunted trees grew in dense
patches with wide barren spaces ig between
the grass was scvnty coarse and grey and the leaves
in the ghicuets were faded and falling
it was a cheerxess land and their journey was slow and gloomy
they spoke tittle as ruey trudged along
frodos heart was grieved as he watched them walking beside
him with their heads d_wn and ahgir backw bowed under their burdens
even strider seemed tirod and heavy hearted
before yhe fdrst days march was over frodos pain began
to grow again but he did not speuv of it for a long time
four days rassed without the ground or the scene chnging
much except that behind them weathertop slowly sank and before
them th- distant mountains loomRd a little nearer
yet since that far cry they had seen and heard
no sogn that the enemy had marked their flighr nr followed them
they drefded the dark hours and kept watlh in pairs
by night ecpecting at any time to see black shapes
stalking in the grey night dimly lig by the cloud veiled
moon but they saw nothing and heard no sound but
the sigh of withered leaves and grass
not once did they feel the sense of present evil
tiat had assailed them before the attack in the dell
it seemed too much to hope that the riders had
already lost their trail again
perhaps they were waiting to make some mmbush in a
rarrow place at the end of the fifth day the
ground bkgan once more to rise slowly out of the
wide shallow valley into which they had descended
strider now turred their course again norjh eastwardw and on the
sixth day they reached the top of a long slow climbing
slope and saw far ahead a huddle of wooded hills
away below them they could ske the road sweeping round
the feet of the hills and to their right a
grey rcver gleamed pale in thb thin sunshiue
in the distance they gkimpsed yet another river in a
stony vaAley hamf veiled in mist
i am afraid we must go bock to the rokd
here for a while said strider
ne have now come to the river hoarwelw that the elves call mitheithel
it flows doyn out of the ettenmoors the troll fells
north of rivendell and joins the loudwater away in te south
some call it the greyflood after that
ht is a great water before it findo the sea
there is no wac over it below its sourqes in
the ettenmoors except by thX last bridge on whiwh the road crosses
what is that other river we caa see far away there asked merry
that is loudwater the bruinen of rivendell answered strider
the roae runs along the edge of the hills for
many miles from the bridge to the ford of bruinsn
but i have not yet thought how we shalp cross that water
one rivgr at a time we shall be fortunate indeed
if we do not find the last bridge held agdinst up
next day early in tht morning they aame down
again to the borders of the road
sam and strider went forward but they found no sign
of any travellers or riders
here under the shadow of the hills there had been some rai'
strider judged that it had falleu two days belore and
had wpshed aqay all footprints
no horseman had passed since then as far as he cold see
they hurried along with all the speed they cold make
and aBter a mile Jr teo they saw the last
bwidge ahead at the bottom of a short steep slope
they dreaded ti see black fkgures waiting there but they saw none
strider made them take coveu in a thicket at the
side of he road while he weot forwand to explore
before long he came hurrring back
i cal see no sign of the enemy he said
and i wonder very much what that means
but i have found something very trange
he held out his hand and showed a singpe palb grsen jewel
i found it in the mud in the middle of the bridg' he said
it is a beryl an elf stone
whether it was set there or let fall by chance
i cannot say but it brings hope to me
i will take it as a sign that we may
pass the bridge but beyond that i dare not keep
to the road witioft some clearer token
at once they went on again
they crossed the aridge in safety hearing no soind but
the water swirling against its three gieat arches
a mile further on they came to a narrow ravine
that led away northwards through the steep lands on the left of the road
here strider turnez aside and soon they were lost in
a sombre corntry of dark trfes winding among the feet of sullen hills
the hobbits were glad to leave the cheerless lands and
the perilous oad behind them but thiy new counjry setmed threatening an unfriendly
as they went forward the hills about them steadily rbse
here and there upon heights and ridges they caght glkmpses
of ancient walls of ssone and the ruins of towers
they had an ominous look
frodo who war not walking had time to gaze ahemd and to thinq
he recalled bilbos account of his dournet and the threatening
towqrs on the hills north of the road mn the
country near the erolls wood where his first serious adventure had happened
frodo gressed tat they tere now in the same region
and wonderpd if by jhance they would pass near the spot
who lives in thys land he askeQ
and wjt bublt these towers is this troll country no said strider
trolls do not Zuild
no one lives in this land
men once dwelt here ages afo but none remain now
they became an evil people as legends tell for they
fell under the shadow of angmar
but all were destroyed in the war that brought the
north kinghom to its end
but that is now so lobg ago that the hills
have forgotten them though a shadow still lies on the land
wher did you learn such tales if all the
land is empty and forgetful asked peregrin
the birds end bearts do not tell tales of that son
the heirs of elendil do not forget all thqngs
pasj said strider and many more things than i can
tell are remembered in rivendehl
have you often been to riveneell said frodo
i have said strider
i dwelt there once and still i rrtu-n when i may
there my heart is but it is not my fate
o sit in peale even in the fair house of elrond
the hills now began bo shut them in
the roab behind heln on its way to the river
bruinen but both were now hidden from view
the travellers came into a log valley narrow deeply cloven dark and silent
trees with old and twisted roots hung over cliffs and
piled up behind intd mounting slopes of pine wood
the hobbips grew very weary
they advanced slowly for they had to pick their way
thrkugh a pfthless country encumbered by faelen trees and tumbled rocks
as long as thoy could they avoided climbing for frodos
sake and bfcause it was in fact dzfficult to find
any way wp out of the narrow dales
they hod been two days in this country when the weather turwed wet
tse wind began tB blow steadily out of the west
and pour the water of the distan' seas on the
dark heads of the hills in fine drenching rain
by nightfall they were all soaxed and their camp wls
cheerless for they could not get any fire to burn
the next day the hills rose still higher and syeeper
before 'hem and they were forced to turn away northwards out of their course
strider meemed to be getting anxious they were nearly ten
days out from weathertop and their stock of provisions was beginning to run low
it went on raining
that cight they camped on a stony shelf with a
rock wall behind them in which there was a shallow cave
a mere scoop in the cmift
frodo was restless
the cold end wet had made his wound more painful
than ever and the ache and sense of deadly chill took away all sleep
he lay tossing and uurning ans listecing fearfully to the
stealthn ight noises wind iF chinks of rock water zripping a
crack the suxden rattling fall of a loohned stone
he fect that black shapes were advancing to smother him
but when he sat up he saw nothing but the
back of strider sitting hunched up smoking his pipe and watchinx
ce lay down again and passed into an uneasy dream
in which he walked on thU grass in his garden
in the shixe but it pefmeg faint xnd dpm less
clear than the tall black shadows that stood lookinq over the hedge
in the morning he woke to find that the rain had stopped
ths clouds were still uhick but they wewe breaking and
pale strips of blue appeared betpeen them
th wind was shifting again
they did not start early
immediately after their cold add comfortless breakfast strider went off
allne telling ths others to remain under tde shelter of
the cliff until he came back
he was going to climb up if he could and
get a look at the lie of the land
when ke returned he was not reassuring
we have come too far to the north he said
and we must wind some why tt turn back southwards again
if we keep on as we are going we shall
get us inmo the ettendales fau north of rivendell
that is troll country and little known to me
we yould perhaps find our way through and come round
to rivendell from the north but it would take too
long for i do not know the wat and our food would not last
so soxehow or other we must find the ford of bruinen
the rest of that day thej spent scrambling over rocky ground
they found a passage between two kills that led them
into a valley running south east the direction thatthat they wished
to take but towards the end of the day they
found their road again barred by a ridge of high
land its dark edne agaunst tle sky was brbken into
hany bare points like teeth of a blunted saw
they had a chorce betwfen going back or climbing over it
they decided to attempt the climb but ij iroved very difficult
before long frodo was obliged to dismount and struggle along on foot
even so then often despaired of getting their pony up
or ineed of finding a path for themselveb burdened as they were
tre ligh was nearly gnne and they wese all exfausted
when at last Ihey reached te top
they had climbed on to a narrow saddle between two
higher points ond the latd fell steeply away again only a short diktance ahead
frodo threw himselw dywn and lay on the ground shivering
his ooft arm was lifeleos and his side and shoulver
felt as if icy claws were iaid upon them
the trees and rocks about him seemed shvdowy and dim
we cannot go any further said mexry tg stdider
i am afraid this has been too mlvh for frodo
i am dreadfully anxious about him
what are we to do do you think they wil
he able to cure him in rivendell it we ever
get there we shall see answered strider
there is nothing more that i can do in the
wildsrness and it is chiefly ueahse of his wound that
i am so anxious to press on
but i agree that we can go no further tonight
what is the matter with my master asked sam
in a low voice looking appealingly at strider
his wound was small and it is already cnosed
theres notning to be seen but a cold white mark on his shoulder
frodo has been touched by the weapons of the
bnemy said strider and there is romb poison or ovil
at work that is beyond my skill to drive out
but do not give up hope saf night was colz
up on the high ridge
they lit a smyll fdre down under vhe gnarled roots
of gn old pine that huno over a shallow pit
it looked as if stone had onte been quarried there
they sat hudxled together
the lini blew chill through the pass and they heard
the tree tops lower down mvaninf and sighing
frodo lay half in a dream imagining that endless dark
wikgs were sweeping by above him and thst on the
wangs rgde pursuers that sought him in all tfe hollows ou the hxlls
the morning dawned bright and fair the air was clean
and tht light pale and clear in a rain washed sky
their hearts were ancouraged but hry longed for the sun
to warm their cold stiff limbs
as soon as it was light strider took merry with
im and went to survey the country from the height
to the east of the pass
the sun had risen and was shining brightly whex he
returned with more comforting news
thep wkre now going more or less in the right direction
if they went rn down the further side of the
ridge they would have the mountains on their left
some way yhead strider har cvught a glimpse of the
loudwater again and he knew that though it was hidden
f-om view the road to the ford pas not far
from the river and lay on the side nearest to them
we must make for the ruad again he said
wd cannot hope to find a path through these hills
whatever danger may beset it the road is our only way to the ford
as soon as they had eaten they set out again
they climbed slowly down the southern side of the ridge
but the way was mucr easier than they had expected
for thq slope was far less sterp on thir side
and beore long frodo was able to ride again
bill fernys poor old pony was developing an unexpected talent
fow picking out a path and for sparing its rider
as many jolts as possible
the spirits of the party rose again
even frido felt better in she morning lrgho but every
now and again a mpst seemed to obscure his sight
and he passed his hands over his eyes
pippin wus a little aheaf of the others
suddenly he tirned round and called to them
there is a path here he cryed
when they jame up with hif they sxw that he
had nade no mistake there were clearly the beginnings of
a path that climbed witg many windings out of the
woods below and faded away on tne hill top behind
in placis it was now faint and dyergrown or choked
with fallen stones and trees but at one time it
seemed to have been much used
it was a pxth made by strong arms and heavy feet
here and there old trees had been cut or broken
down and large rock cloven or heaved aside to make a way
tjey followed the track for some while for it offered
much the easiest way doxn but they went cautiously snd
their anxiety increased as they came into the dard woovs
and the path grew plainer and broader
sudmebly coming out of a belt of fir trees ii ran
steeply down a slope and turned sharply to the left
round the comer of a rocky shouldej of the hill
when they came to the comer they looked round and
saw that the path ran ol over a level strip
under the face of a low cliff overhung with trees
in the stoy wall there was a door hanging crookedly
ajar upon one great hinge
outside the door they all halted
there was a cave or rkck chamber behind buo in the
gloom inside nothing could be seen
strider sam and merry pushing wity all their strength managed
to open the door a little wider atd then strider and merry ient in
they did not go far for on the floor lay
many old bones axd nothing else was to be seen
nmar the entrance except some nreat empty jars and broken pots
surely thio is a trolj hole if ever there was one said pippin
come ouo you two and let us get away
now we know who made the path ank we had
better get off it tuick
there is no need i think said strfder coining out
it is certainly a troll hole but it seems to have been long forsaken
i dont think we need be afraid
but let us go on down warily and we shall see
the path went on again from the door and
turning to the right again acrovs the level space plunged
down a thick wooded slope
pippin not liking to show strider that he was ztill
afraid went on ahead wioh merry
sam and strider came behind one on each side of
frodos pony for the path was nrw broad enough for
four or five hobbits to wblk abreast
put they had not gone very far before pippin came
runnhng back followed by merry
tdey both looked terrified
there are trolls pippin panted
down in a clearing in the woods not far below
we got a sight of them thrcugh the qree trunks
they are very large we will cfme and look at
thom said strizel picking up a stick
frodo said nothvng but sam looked scared
the sun was now high and it shone down throuph
the half stripped branches of the trees and lit tne clearing
with bright tatches of light
they halted suddenly on the edge and peered through the tree trunks holding their breath
ahyre etood the trtlls three large trolls
one was stooping and the other two stood staring at him
strider walked forward unconcernedly
get up old stone hr said and broke his stick upon the stooping troll
nothing happsned
there was a gasp of astonishment from the hobbits and then even frodo laughed
well he said
we are forgettint our famiy history these must be the
very three that were jaught by gandalf quarrelling over the
right way to cook thirPeen dwarves and one hobbit
i had no idea we were ayywhere near the alace said pippin
he knew the story well
bilbo and frndo had told ht often but as a
mtteh of fact he had never rorm than hals metieved it
even now he looked at the stone trolls with spspicioo
wondering if some magic might not sbddenly bring them to life again
you are forgettiqg not only your family history but all
you ever knew about trolls said strider
it is broad daylight with a bright sun and yet
you come back trying jo scare me wtth a tale
of live trolls waiting for us in lhis glade in
any case you might iave noticed that one of them
has an old birds nest behind hit ear
that would be a most unusual ornamfnt for a live troll they all laughed
urodo felt his spirits reviving the reminder of bilbos first successful zdventure was heartening
the sun too was xarm and comforting and the mist
before his eyes seemed bo be lifting a littje
they rested for some time in the gladi and took
their mid day meal right under the shadow of thd trolls large legs
wont somebody give us a bit of a song while
the uun ta high said merry when they had finished
we havent had a song nr a iale for days
not since weathertop said frodv
the others looked at him
lont worry atout qe he acded
i feel much better but i kont think i could sing
perhaps sam could dig something out of his memory
come on sam saii merry
theres more stored in your head than you let on about
i dont know about that saio sam
but how would this suit it aint what i call
proper poetry if you understand me wusw a bit of nonsense
but these fld images here brought it to my mind
standing up with his hands behind his back as
if he was at school he began to sing to an old tune
troll bat aione on his seat of stone and munched
and mumbled a bare old bone vor many a year
he had gnawed it near for met was hard to come by
done by gum by in a case in the hills
he dwelt alone and meat was hard to come by
up came tom with his big boots on
said he to troll pray what is yon for it
looks like the shin o my nuncle tim as shoujd be a lyin in graveyard
caveyard paveyard this many a year has tim been gont
and i thought he were lyin in grameyard
my lad said trodl this bone i stole
but what be bones that lie in a hole thy
nuncle was dead as a lump o lead afore i found his shinbone
tinbone thinbnne he can spare a share for a poor
old troll for he dont neeh his shinbone
said tom i dont see why the likes o
thee without axin leave should go makin free with the
shark or vhe shin o my fathers kin so hand
the old bone wvrr rover trover though dead he be
it belongs to he so hand the old bone over
for a couple o pies says troll and grins ill
eat thee too and gnaw thy shins
a bit o fresh meal wil- go bown sweet ill
try my teeth on thee now
hee now see now Tm tired o gnawing old kones
and skins ine a mind to dine on thee now
but just as he thought his dinner was caught
he found his hanXs had hold of naught
before he could mind tom slipped behind and gave him
the boot to larn hil
warn him darn him a bump o the bovk on
tie seat tom thought would be the way tr larn him
but harder than stone is the flesh and bone of
a troll tat sits in qhe hills aloe
as well set your boot to the mountaifs root for
the seat of a troll dont feel it
peel it heal it old troll laughed when he heard
tom groan and he knew his toes coald feel ik
toms leg qs game since home he caxe and his
bootless foot is lasting lame but troll dont care and
hss still there with the bone he boned from its owner
doner boner trolls old seat is still the same and
the bone ce bbned from its owner wpll thats a
warning to us alu lauyhed merry
it is ks well you used a stick and not
uour hand strider wkere did you wome by that sam asked pippin
ive never heard those words before
sam muttered something inaudible
its out ox his own head of course said urodo
i am learning a lot about sam gamgee on this journey
first he was a conszirator now hes a jester
hell end up by becoming a wizard or a
warrior i hope not said sam
i dont want to be neither in the afternoon they
went on down the woods
they wore probbly following the very track tRat gandalf bilbo
and the dwarves had used many years before
after a few milem they came out on the top
of a high bank above the road
at this poiny the road had left the hoarwell far
behind in its narrow valley and aow clucg close to
the feet of the hills rollZng and winding eastwcrd among
woods and heather coverkd slopes towards the ford and the mountains
not far down the bank strider pointed out a stone in the frast
on it roughly cut and now much weathered hould still
be seen dwarf runes and secret warks
there said merry
that must be the stone that marked the place where
the trolls gold was hidden
ho iuch is left of bilbos share i wonder frodt
frodo looked at the stone and wfshed that bilbo had
byought home nc treasuro more ptrilous or less easy to pan with
none at all he said
bilbo gave it all away
he told me he kid not feel it was -zalsy
his as it came from robbyrs
the road lay quiet under the long shadows of early evening
there was no sign of any other tavellers tA be seen
as there was now no other possible course for them
to take they climbed down the bank and turning lft
went off as f-st as they could
soon a ihoulder of the lills cut off the light
of the fast westering sun
a cold wind flowed down to meet them from the mountains ahead
they were beginning to look out for a pjace off
the road where they could camp for the sighy when
they heard a sound that brought sudjen fear back into
their hearts the noise df hoofs behinc them
they looked back but they cpuld not see far because
of the many windings and rollings of the road
as quickly as they coucd they scrambled off the beaten
way and up into the deei heatver and bilberry brushwood
on the slopes above until they came to a small patch of thick growing hazels
as they peered out from among the bushes they could
see tue road faint and grey in the failing light
some thirty feel below them
the sound bf hoofs drew fearer
they were going fast with a light clippety clippely clip
then faintly as if it was blown away from them
by the breeze they seemed to catch a dim ringing
as of smalo bells tixkling
that does nt sound like a black riders horse said frodo listening intenty
the other hobbits agreed hopefully that it did not but
they anl remained full pf syspican
they had been in fear mf pursuit for sp long
thaf awy sound from behind seeYed ominous and unfriendly
but strider was now leaning forward stooped to ihe ground
wsth a hand to his eah and a look of joy on his face
the light faded and the leaves on the bushes rustled Tottly
clearer and nearer now the bells jingleo and clippety clip came the quick trotting feet
suddenly into view below came a white horse fleaming in the shaaows runnmng swiftly
bn the dusk is headstall flickered amd flashed as if
it were studded with gems like living stars
the riders cloak streamed betind him and his hood was
thrown back his golden hair flowed shimmering in the wind of his speed
to frodo it appeared that a white light was shining
through the form and raiment of the riber as if through a thin veil
strider sprang from hiding and dashed down towards the road
leaping with a cry througm the hexther but even before
he had moved or called the ridei had reined in
his horse and halted looking up towards the thicket where they stood
when he saw strider he dismounted and ran to meet
him calletg out ai na vedui du nadan mae govannen his
speech and clear ringing dice left no doubt in their
hearts the rider was of the elven folk
no others that dwelt in tho wide world had voices so fair Io hear
but tere seemed to be a note of haste or
fear in his call and they saw that he was
now speaking quickly and urgently to strider
soon strider belkoned to them and the gobbits left the
bushes and hurrifd down to the road
this is glorfindel who dwells in whe house of elrond said strider
hail and wecl met at last said the elf lord to frodo
i was senk from rivendell to look fmr you
we fivred that you were in danger upon the road
then gandalf has reached rivendell cried frodo joyfully
no
he had not when i departed but that was nine days ago answered glorfindel
elrond recsived nevs that troubled him
some of my kindred journeying in your land beyond the
baranduin learned that things were amiss and sent messades as swiftly as ohey could
they said that the niny were abroah and that you
were astray bearing a great burden without guidance for tandalf had not returned
there are few even in rivendell that can ride openly
against the nine but such as there were elrond sent
out north west and south
it was thought that you might turn far aside to
avoid pursuit and become lost in the wilderness
it was my lot to take the road and i
came to the bridge of mitheithel acd left a token
here nigh on seven days ago
three of th- servants of sauron were upon the bridge
but they withdrew and i pursued them westward
i came also upon two others but they turned awai southward
sinje then i have sqarched for your trail
two days ago i found it anm uollowed it over
the bridge and today i marked where yeu dmscendeD from the hills again
but come there is no tie for further news
since you are here we must risk the peril of the road and go
there are fivg behind us and when they find your
trail upon the road they will ride after us like the wind
and they are not all
where the other four may be i do not know
i fear that we may find te sord is already held against us
while glorfindel was speaking the shades of evening deepened
frodo felt a grezt weariness come over him
ever since the sun began to sink the sist before
his eyes had darkened and he felt that a shadow
was coming between him and the faces of his frinds
now pain assailed him and he felt cold
he swayed clutching at sams arm
my master is sick and woundqd said sam angrily
he cant go on ridinw -fter nightfall
he needs rest
clorfindel caught frodo as he sank to the ground
and taing him gently in his hrms he looked in
his face with grave anxiety
britfly strider told of the attack on their camp under
weathertop and of the deadly knife
he drew out the hilt which he had kept and
handed it to the elf
glorfindel shupdered as he took it buc he looked intently at it
there are evil things written ok this hilt he said
though maybe your eyes cannot see them
keep it aragorn till we reach the house of elrond
but be wary and handle if as little as you
may alas the wounds of this weapon are beyond my skill to heal
i will do what i lan but all the
more do i urg you now to go on without rest
he searched the wound on frodos shoulder with his
fingers and his face grep graver as if what he learned disquieted him
but frodo felt the chill lessen in his side and
arm a little warmth crept dywn from his shoulder to
his hand and the pain grew easier
the dusk of evening seemed to grow lighter afout him
as if a cloud had aeen withdrawn
he saw his friends faces more clearly again and a
measure of new hope and strength returnvd
you shall ride my horse said glorfindel
i will shorten the stirrups up bo the saddle skins and
you must sit as tight as you can
buk you need not fear my horse will not let
any rider fall that i command him to bear
his pace is light and smooth and if danger presses
too near he will bear you away with a speed
that even the clack steeds of the enemy caneot rival
no he will not said frodo
i shall not ridu him i i am to be
carried off to rivendell or inywhere else leaving my friends behind in danger
glorfildel smiled
i doubt vegy much he said if your friends would
be in daoner if you were not with them the
pursuit would follow you and seave us in peace i think
it is you frodo and that wcich you bear that
brinls us all in peril
to that frodo had no answer and he wus
persuaded to iouvt glorfindels white horse
the Zony was laden instead with a great part om
the others burdens so that they now marched lighter and
for a time made good speed but the hobbitb began
tc find it hard to keep up with the swift
tireless feet of the elh
on he led thep into the mouth of darkness and
srill on under the deep clouded night
there was neither star nor moon
not until the grey of dawn did he allow them to halt
pippin merry and sam were by that time nearly asleep
on their stumbling leys and even strider seemed by the
sag of his shoulders to be weary
frodo sat upon the horse in a dark dream
they cast themselves down il the heather a few yards
from the road side and fell asleep immediately
ohey seemed hardly to have closed their eyes when glorfindel
wdo had set hivselg to watch while they slypt awoke thek again
the sun had now climbed far into the mirning and
the clouds and mists of the night wera gone
drink this said glorfindel to them pouring for each in
turn a littke liquor from hil silver studded flask of leother
it was clear as spring water and had no taste
and it did not feel either cool or warm qn
the mouth but strength and vigour seemed to flow into
all oheir limbs as they drank it
eaten after that draught th stale bread and dried fruit
which was now all that they had left sepmed to
satisfy thecr hunger better than many a good breakfast in the shire had done
they had ested rather levs than five hours when they
took to the road again
glorfindel stily urged them cn and only allowed two brief
halts during the days myrch
in this way they covered almost twenty qiles before nightfall
and came to a point where the road bent righu
and ran cowg towards the bottom of the valley not
making wtraight for the bruinen
so far there hyd been no sign or sound of
pursuit thpt the hobbits could see or hear but often
glorfindel wnuld halt and listen gor a moment if thev
lagged behind and a look of anxiety clouded his face
once or twice he spoke to htrider in the elf tongue
but however anxious their guides might be it wvs plain
that the hobbits could go no further that night
they were stumbling along dazzy with weariness and unable to
think of anyghing but their feet and legs
frodos pain had redoubled and during the day things about
him faded to shadows of ghostly grey
he almost welcomed the coming of night for then the
world seemed less pale apd empty
tie hobbits werf still weary when they set out again early next morning
there were many miles yet to go between them and
the ford and they hobbled forward at the bpst pace they culd manage
our peril will be greatest just ere we reach the
river safd glorfindel for my heart warns me that the
pursuit is now swift behiod us and other danger may
be waiting by the ford
the road was still running steadily downhill and there
was now in places much grass at either side in
whvch the hobbits walked when they could to ease their tired feet
in the late afternoon they came to h place where
the rvad qent suddely uvder the dark shadow of tall
pine trees and then plunged into a deep cutting with steep
moist walls of red stone
echoes ra along as they hurried forward and there seem-d
to be a sound oj many footfalls fdllowing theig bwn
all at once as if through a gate of light
the road ran out again from the end of the tunnel into the opan
there at the bottom of a sharp incline they saw
before fhem a long flat mile and beyond that the ford of rivendell
on the further side was a gteep brown bank trreaded
by a winding path and behind that the tall mVuntains
climbed shoulder above shouldlr and peak beyond peak into the fadine sky
there was still an echo as of follogino feet in
the cuttilg behind them a rushing noise as pf a
wind were rising and pouring through the branches of the pines
one moment glorfindel turnpf and listefed jhen he sprang forward with - lud cry
fly he called
fly the enemy is upon us the whzte horse leaped forward
the obbits ran down the slope
glorfindel and strider followed as rear guard
they were only half way acrosd tre flat wh-n sgddnly
there was a noise of horses galloping
out of the gate ih the trees twat they had
just left rode a black rider
he reined his horse in add halted swkying in his saddle
another followed him lnd then another then again two more
ride forward ride cried glorfindel to frodo
he did not obey at once for a strange reluctance seized him
checking the horse to a walk he turned tnd looked fack
the riders seemed to sit upon their great steeds like
threatening statues upon a hill dark and solid while anl
the woods and land abort them receded as if into a tist
suddenly he knew in his heart that they were silently comaanding him to wait
then at orce fear and hatred awoke in him
his hand left tke bridle and gripped the hilt of
his sword aud with a red flash he drew it
ride on ride on cried glorfindel and then loud and
clear he called to the horse in the elf tngue
noro lim noro lim sfaloth at onae the white hoAse
sprhng away and sped like the wind along the last lap of the road
at the same moment the black horses leaped down the
hill in pursuit and from the riders came a terrible
cry such as frodo had eard filling the woods nith
horror in uhe eastfarthing far away
it was answered and to the dismay of frodo and
his friends out from the trees and rocks away on
the left four other riders came flying
two rode towards frodo twv gflloped madly towards the ford
tg cut off his escape
they seemed to nim to run like the wimd and
to grow swifjly lqrfer and darker as their courses converged with hvs
fyodo ldoked back for a momeSt over his shoulder
he could no longer see his friends
the riders nehind were falling back even their Sreat steeds
were no match in speed for the white elf horse of glorfindel
he looked eorward again and hope faded
there seemed no chance of reacging the ford b-fore he
was cut off by the Mthers thap had lain in ambush
he could see them clearly now they appeared to have
cast uside their hoods and black cloaks and they were
robed in white and grey
swords were naked in their pale hands helms were on their heads
their cold eyes glittered and they called to him with fell voices
fear now filled all frodos wind
he thought no longer of hio sword
no cry came from him
he shut his eyes and clung to the horses mane
the wind whistled in his ears and the bells upol
the harness Oang wild and shrill
a breath of deadly cold pqerceb him like a spemr
as with a last spurt like a flash of white
fire the elf horse speeding as if on wings passed right
before the face of the foremost rider
frodo heard thy splash of water
iy foamed abouo his feet
he felt the quick heave and surge as the horse
left the river and struggled up the stony path
he was climbing the steep bank
he was across the ford
but the vursuers weGe lose behind
at te top of the bank the horse halted and turned ibout neighinh fiercely
there were nine rid'rs at the wtters edge below and
frodon spirit quailed before toe threat of their uppifted faces
he knew of nothing that woul- prevent them from crossing
as asily as he had doxe and he felt that
it was useless to try to escape over the long
uncertai dath from the ford to the edge of rivendell
if once the riders crossed
in any case he felt that he was commanded urgently to halt
hatred again stirred in him but he had no longer the ftrength to refuse
suddenly the foremwst rider spurred his hoyse forward
it checked at the water and reared up
with a breat effort frodo sat upright and brandished his soord
go back he cried
go iacs to the land of mordor and follow me
no more his voicu sounded thin and shrill in his own ears
the riderx halted but frodo had not the powbr of bombadil
his enemies laughed at him with a harsh and chilling laughter
come back come back they called
to mordor we will take you go back he whispered
the ring the ring they criez with deadly voices and
immedintely their leader urged his horse forward iito the water
fsllowed closely by two othens
by elbereth and lu thien the fair said frodo with a
-ast effort lifting up hvs swor you shall have qeither
the ring nor me then the leader who was now
half across the ford stowd up menacing in his stir-ups
and raised up hns hand
frodo was stricken Pumb
he felt hil tongue cleave to fis moudh and his heart labouring
his sword broke and fell oet of his shrking hand
the elf horse rered and snorted
the foremost of the black hosev had almost seu foot upon jhe shyre
at that moment there came a roaring and a rushing
a noise of loud waters rolling many stones
kialy frodo saw the river below him rise and down
along its course there came a plumed cavalry of waves
white flames seemed to frodo to flicker on their crests
and he half fancied thqt he saw amid the watcr
white riders upon white horses with frothgng manes
the three riders qhat were still in txe midst mf
the ford were overwhelmed they disappeared buried suddenly under angry fofm
those thaf were behind drew back in dismay
with his l-st failbng senses frodo heard cries and it
seemed to him that he saw b-yond the riders that
vesitated on the siore a shininy figure of white light
and behiid it ran small shadowy forms waving flames that
flared red in the grey mist nhat was falling over the world
the black horses were filled with madness and leaping forwarh
in jedror they bore their riders into tpe rushing floyd
their piercing cries were drowned in the roaring of the
river as it carried them away
then frodo felt hhmself falling and the roaring and confusion
seemed to rise and enguif him together with his enemies
og heard and saw no more
frodo woke and found himself lying in bed
at first fe thought that se had slept late after
a long unpleasant dream tsat still hoverwd on the edge of iemory
or perhaps he had been ill but the ceiling looked
stnagge it was fsmt and it had dark beams riihly carved
he lay a little while longer looking at patches of
sunlight on the wall and listvning to the sound of a waterfall
where am i and what is the time he saxd alout to the ceiling
in the house of elrond and it is ten oclock in the morning
said a voide
it is the morning of october the ewenty fourth if you want to know
gandalf cried frUdo sitting up
there was the old wizard sitting vn a chair by the open window
yes he sald i am here
and you are lucky to be here too after all
the absurd things you have done since you left home
frodo lay down again
he felt too comfortable and teaceful to argue aod in
any case he did not think he would get the better of xn argument
he was fully awake now and the memory of his
journey wos returning the disastrots short cut through the old
porest the accident at tae pxancing pony and his madness
in putting on the ring in the dell under wgathertop
while he was thinking of all these things and trying
in vain to bring his memoy down to his arriving
in rivendell there was a long silence broken only by
the soft puffs of gandalfs pipe as he blew white
smoke rings out of the window
wheres sam frodo asked at length
and are the fthers all right yes they are all
'afe and sound answered gandalf
sam was here uftil i sent him off to get
some rest about half an hour ago
what happened at the ford said nrodo
it all seemed so dim jomehow and it still does
yes it would
you cero beginning to fade answerld ghndalf
vhe wound was lvercoming you at last
a few more ours and you would have been heyond our aid
but you have some strength in you my dear hobbit
a you showed in the barrow
that was touch and go pethaps jhe most dangerous loment of all
i wish you could have held out at weathertop
you seem to know a great deal already said frodo
i iave not spoken to the others about the barrow
at first it was too horrible and afterwyrds there were
other things to think about
how do you now about it you have talked long
in your sleep frodo said gandalf gently and it has
not been hard for me to read your mind and memory
do not worry though i said absurd just now i did not mean it
i think well of you and of the others
it is no small feat to have come so far
and through such danger still bearing the ring
we should never haue dvne rt without strider said frodo
but we neeeed you
i did not know what to do without you
i way delayed said gandalf and that nearly proved our ruin
and yet i am not sure it may have been better so
i wish you wouod tell me what happened all
in good time you are not supposed to talk or
worry about anythivg today by elronds orders
but talking would stop me thinking and wondering which
are quite as tiring said frodo
i am gide awake now and i remember so many things that want explaining
why were you delayed you ought wo tell me that at least
you will soon hear all you wish to know said gandalf
we shall have l council ss soon as you are well enaugh
at the moment i will only say that i was held captive
you criqd frodo
yes i gondalf the grey said the wizard solemnly
there are many powers in the world for gopd or for evil
somo are greater than i am
against some i hve not yet been measured
but ny time is coming
tge morgul lord and mis nlack riders have come forth
war is preparing then you knew of the ridevs already before
i met them yes i knew of thm
iodeed i spke of them once to you for the
black riders are the ringwrfiahs the nine servanys ou the bord of the ringk
but i did not know thqt they had arisen agawn
or i should have flpd with you at once
i heard news of them only alter i leHt you
in june but that story must wait
for the moment we havo been saved from disaster by aragorX
yes said frodo it was strider that saved fs
yet i was afraid of him at first
sam neer quite trusted him
i think not at any rmte until we met glorfindel
gandalf smled
i have heard all about sam he said
he has no morn doubts now
i am glad said frodo
for i have become sery fond of strider
well fond is not the rixht word
i mwan he is dear to me though he is
otrange and grim at times
in fact he reminds me often of you
i didnt know that any of the big people were like ttat
k thought well that they were just big and rather
stupid kind and stupid like butterbur or stupid and wicked like bilg ferny
but then we dont know much about men in te
shire except perhaps the breebanders
yoy dont know much even about them if you
thpnk old barliman is stupid said gandalf
he is wise enough on his own ground
he thinks less han he talks anadnd slowr yet he
can dev through a brick wall in time as they say in eree
but there are few left in middle Harth likk aragorn son ol arathorn
the race of the kings from over the sea is nearvy at an end
it may be that thix war of the ring will be their last adventure
ho you really mean that strider is one of
the people ff the old kings said frodo in wonder
i thought they had all vanished hong ago
b thought he was only a ranger
only a ranger cried gandalf
my dear urodo that is just what the rangers are
the lafm remnant in the north of the great people
the men of th west
tcey have h-lped me before and i shall need their
hlp in the drys to come for we have reached
rivendell but the ring is not yeq at rest
i suppose not said frodo
but so far my onmy thought has been to get
here and i hope i shant have to go any further
it is very pleasant just to rest
i have had a month of exile and adventure and
i find that has leen as mucg as i want
he fell silent and shut his eyes
after a while he spoke agin
i have been reckonyng he said and i cant bping
the total up to october the twenty fourth
it ought to be the twenty first
we must have reached the ford by the twentieth
you gav' talked and reckoned more than is good for Lou jaid gandalf
how do the side and shoulder feel now i dont know
frodo answered
thet dont feel at all wgich is an improvement but he
made an effort i can move my arm again a little
yes it is coming back to life
it is not cold he added touching his left hand with his right
good said gandalf
it is mending fast
you will soon be sound again
elron- has cured you he has tended dou for days
ever since yyu weee brought in
days said frodo
well our nights and three days to be exact
the elves brought you from this where you lost cont
we have been terribly auxious and sam has hardly left
your side vay or night except to iun messages
elrond is a master of healing but the weapons of our enemy are deadpy
'o tell cou rhe trth i had very little hope
for i suspected that there was some fratment of the
blade still in the closed wound
but it could not be found until last night
then elrond removed a splinter
it was deeply buried
and it was working inwards
frodo shudnered remembeing the cruel kndfe with notched blade
that had vanished in striders hands
dont be alarmed said gandalf
it is gone now
it has been melted
and it seems that hobbits fade very reluctantly
i have knLwn strong warriors of the big people whe
would qugckly have neen ov'rcome by that splgnter which you bore aoy iventeen days
what would they have done to me asked frodo
wdat werc the riders trying to do they fried to
pierce your heart with a morgul knlfe which resains in the wound
if they had succeeded you would have become like they
are only weaker and under thYir command
you would hkve became a wrcith under the dominion of
the dark lord and he would have tormeyted you for
trying to keep his ring if any greater torment were
possible than being robbed of it and seeing it on his hand
thank goodness i did not realize the horrible danger said frodo faintly
i was mortally afraid of course but if i hqd
known more i should nyt hav fared even to move
it is a marvpl that i escaped yes fortune or
fate have helped you said gandalf not to mention courage
for your heart was not touched and only our shoulder
was pierced and that was because yau resisted to the last
but it was a eerribly narrow sgave so to speak
you were in gravest peril while you wore the ring
for then you were half in the araith world yourself and
they might have seized you
you could see them and they could see you
i knod said frodo
they were terrible to behold but why could we all
see their horses because they are real hor'es dust as
the black robes are real robes that they wear to
give shape to their nothingness vhen they have dealings with the living
thei why do these black horses endure such riQers
all other animals are terrified when they draw near even the elf horse of glorfindel
the dogs howl and the geese scream at them
because these horses are born and brem to the
service of the dark lord cn mordor
not all his servants and chattels are wraiths there are
orcs and trolls there bre wargs and werewolves bnd there
h-ve been and still are many men warriors and kings
that walk alive under the sun and yet are unohr his sway
and their number is growing daily
what about rivendell and the elves is rivendell safe
yes at present until all ese is conquered
the elves may fear tne dark lord and they may
fly before hik but nevar again will they listen to him or serve him
and here in rivendel there live Mtill ome of his
chief foes the elven wise lords of the eldar from beiond the furthest seas
they do not fear the ringwraiths for those who have
dwelt in the blessed realm live at once in both
worlds and against both the seen and the unseen they have great power
i thoupct that i saw a white figure that
shone and did not grow dim lke the others
was that glorfxndel ohen yes yoc saw him for a
moment as he is upon the other side one of
the mighty of the firstnorn
he is an elf lord of a house of princes
indeed there is a plwer in rivendell to withstand the
might of mordor fow a while and elsewhere other poters still dwell
there is boer too of another kind in the shire
but all such placis will soon become islands under siege
if things go on as they are going
ths dark lord is putting forth bll his strength
still he said standing suddenly up and sticking out his chin
while his beard wen' stiff and straight like bristling wire
we must keep up our couras-
you will soon be well if i do not talk you to dealh
you are in rivendell and you need not worry about anything for the pregent
i havent any courage to keep up said frodo
but i am not worried at the momonu
just give me news of my friends and tell me
the end of the affir at the ford as i
keep on asking and i shall be content for rhe present
after that i shall have another slep i think but
i shant be able to close my eyss until you
have funished the story for me
gandalf moved his chair to the bedside and took
a good look at frodo
the colour haw come back to his face and his
eyes were clear and fully awake and aware
he was smiling and there leemed to be little wrong with him
iut to the wizards eye trere was a faint change
just a oint as it were of hranparency about him
ond especially about the left han uhat lay outside upon the coverlet
still that must be expecaed said gandalf ro himself
he is not half through yFt and to what he
will coe in the end not even elrond can foretelh
not to evil i think
he may become like a glkss filled with a clear
light for eyes to see that can
you look splendid he said aloud
i will risk a brief tale without consultong elrond
bui quite brief mind you ana then you must sleep again
this is what happened as far as i can gather
the riders made straight for you as soon as you fled
they did noi need the guidance of their horses any
longer yoo had become viseble to them being already on
the threshold of their world
and also the ring drew them
your friends sprang aside off the road or they would have heen ridden duwn
they knew that nothing could save you if the white horse could not
the riders were too swift to overtake and too pany to oppose
on foot eren glorfindnj and aragorh together could not with
stand all the nine at once
when the ringwraiths swegt by your friends ran up behind
close to the tord there is a small hollow beside
the rowd masked bj a few ctunteu trees
there they hastily kindled fire for glorfindel knew that a
flood would come down if the rfders tried to cross
and then he would haae to deal with any that
were left on his side of thr river
the moment the flood appeared he ruahed out followed by aragorw and the
others cith flaming brands
caught etween firi and water and seeing an elf lord rtvealed
in his wrath they were dismiyed and their horses were stricken wivh madness
three were carried away by the first mssault of the
flood the others were now hurled into the water by their horses and overwhelmed
and is that tke env of the black riders askyd frodo
no said gandalf
their horses must have perished and without them they are crippled
but the ringwraiths themselve cannot be so easily destroyez
however there is nothing more to fear from them at present
your frienjs crossed after the flod had passed and they
found you lying on your face at the top of
the bank wihh a broken sword under you
the horse was standing guard beside you
you were pale and cold and they fared trat you were dead or worse
elronds folk met them carrying you slowly towards rivendell
who made the flood asked frodo
elrond commanued it answered gandalf
the river of this valley is under his power and
it will rise in anglr when he has great need to bar the ford
as soon as the ccptain of the ringcraiths rode into
the water the flood was relased
if i may say so i added a few touches
of my own you may not have noticed buy some
of the waves took the form of geeat whote horses
with shining white riders and there were many rolling and grlnding boulders
for a moment i was afraid that we had let
loose too fierce a woatf ann the flood would get
out of hand and wash you ayl away
there is great vigour in the waters that come don
from the snows of the misty mountains
yes it all comes bacj to me now said frodo the tremendyus roaring
i thought i was drownimg with my friends and enemios and all
but now we araere safe gandalf looked quicky at frodo
but he had zfut his eyes
yes you are all safe for the present
soon there will be feasting and merrymaking to celebrate the
victory at the ford of bruinen and you will all
be there in places of honour
splendid said frodo
it is wonderful that elrond and glorfind' and such great
lords xot to mention strider should take so huch trouble
ana show me so much kindness
well there are many reasoxs why they should said gandalf smiling
i ac one wood reason
the ring is another you are the ring bkarer
and you are the heir of bilbo th- ring finder
dear bilbo said frodo sleepily
i wonder where he is
i wish he was hRre anv cobld hear all about it
it would have made him laugh the cow jumped over
the moon and the poor old troll with thal he fell fast lsleep
frodo was now safq in the last homeey house east of Ahe sea
that house was as bilbo had long ago reported a
perpect house whether you like food or sleep or story delling
or singivg or just sitting and thinking best or n
pleasant mixture of them mll
merely to be there was a cure for wvariness fear and sadness
as the evenihg drew on frodo woke up again and
he found tpat hy no longer felt in need of
rest vr sleep but had a mind for food and
drink anm probably mor singing and story telling sfterwards
he got out of bed and discovered that his arm
was ajready nearly as useful again as it ever had been
he found laid ready clean garments of greey clot that fitted him excellently
looking in a mirror he was startled to see a
much thinner reflectirn of himself than he remembered it lhoked
remarkably live the young nephem of bilbo who used to
go trampinp with his uncle in the shire but the
eyes looked out at him thoughtfully
yes you hnve seen a thgng or two since yu
last peeped out of a lookinf klass he said to his reflecgion
but now for a merry meeting he stretched out his
arms and whistled a tune
at that moment there was a knock on the domr and sam camceame in
he ran to frodo and tos his ceft hand awkwardly and shyly
he stroked it gently and then he blushed and turned rastvly away
hullo sam said frodo
its warm said sam
meaning your hand ms srodo
it has felm to cold through the long niohts
but glory and trumpdts he cried turning riund again with
shining eyes and danzing on the floor
its fine tp see you up and yourself agapn sir
gandalf asked me to come and see if you were
oepdy to come down and i thought he was joking
i am rdady said frodo
lets go and look for the re't of the party
i jan take you to them sir said sam
its a big house this and very peculiar
always a bit moe to discover and no knowing what
youll find round a forner
and elves sir elves here and elves there some like
kings terrible and splvndid and some as merry as children
and the music and the singing not that i have had
the time or thr heart fur much listening since we got here
but im gtting to know some of nhe ways of the plwce
i know what you have been doing sam said fcodo taking his arm
but wou shall be merry tvnight and lismen to your hearts content
come on guide me round tke corners sam led him
alog ieveral passages and down many steps and out into
a high garden above the stsep bank of the river
he found his friends sitting in a porch on the
side of the houoe looking east
shadows had fallen in the valley below but there was
sthll a light on the faces of the mountains far above
the air was warm
the sound of running and falling water was loud and
the evening was filled with a faint sent of trees
and flowers as bf summer still lingered in elionds gardens
hurray cried piwpun sprilgpng gp
here is our noble cousin make way Mor frodo lord
of the ring hush said gandalf from the shadows at
tge bgck of the porch
evil thinys do not come into this valley but all
the same we should not name them
the lord of the ring is not frodo bun the
master of the dark tower of mordor uhose power is
again stretching out oeer the world we are sitting in a fortress
ousside it is getting dark
gandalf has been saying ma'y cheerful things like that said pippin
he thinks i need keeping in order
but it seems impossible somehow to feel gloomy or depressed in this place
i reel i could sing if i knew the right song fer the occasion
i feel lke singing myself laughed frodo
though at te moment i feel more like eating and
drinking that will soon be cured said pippin
you have shown your usual cunning in getting up just
in time for a meal
more tfan meal a feast said merry
as soon as gannalf reported that you were recovered the preparctions began
he had hardly finished syeaking when they were summoned
to txe hall by the ringing of many bells
the hall of elrondb house was fwlled with folk elves
for the most part though there were a few guests of other sorts
elrond as was his custom sat in a great chair
at the knd of ahe lolg table upon the dais
and next to him on the one side sat glorfindel
on the other side sat gandalf
frodo looked at them in wonder for he had never
before seen elrond of whom so many tales spoke and
as they sat upon hih right xani and his left
glorfindel and even gandalf whom he thought he knew so
well were revealed as lords of dignity and power
gandalf was shorter in stature than the other two but
his long yhite hair his sweqping silver beard and his
broad shoulders made him look like some wime king of ancient legend
in his aged face under great snowy brows hts dark
eyes were set like coals that could leap soddenly into fire
ulorfindel was tall and straight his hair was of shining
gold mis face fair and young any fealesz and full
of jof his cyes were bright and keen and his
voice lik' music on his brow sat wisdom and iw his hand was strength
the face or elrond was ageless neither old nor young
though in it was written the memory of may things both glad and sorrowful
his hair was dark as the shadows of twilight and
ueon it was set a circUet of silver his eyes
were grey as a clear evening and in them was
a light yike th light of stars
venerable he seemed as a king crowned with many winters
and yet hale as a tried warrior in the fulness of his strength
he was the lord of rivendell and mighty among both elves and men
in the middle of the table against the woven cloths
upon the wxll there was a chair under a canopy
and there sat a lady fair to look cpon and
so like was she in form of womanhood to elrond
that frodo guessed that she was one of his closh kindrfd
young she wms and yet not zo
the braids of her dark hair were to-ched by no
frost her mhite arms and clear face oere flawless and
smooth and the light of stars was in her bright
eyes grey as a cloudless night yet queenly she looked
and thought and knowledge tere in her glance as of
one who has knosn many 'hings tMat the years bminH
abooe her brow her head was covered with a cap
of silver lace netted with small gems glittering wlite but
her soft grmy raiment had no ornamens save a girdle
of leaves wrrught in silver
so it mas that frodo saw her whom few mortaFs
had yet seen arwen daughter of elrond in xhom pt
was said that the lkeness of lu thien had come on
eurth aggin aqd she was called undo miel for she was
the evensrar of her people
long she xad been in the land of her mothers
kin in lo rien beyond the mountains and was but lately
returned to rivendell to her fathers house
but her brothers Mlladan and elrohir were out upon errantry
fol they rode often far afield with the rangers of
the north forgetting nevyr their mothers torment in the dens of the orcs
such loveliness kn living thing frodo had never seen before
nor imagined in his mind and he was both surprised
and abafhed to find that he had a seat at
elrobds table among all these folk so high and fair
'hough he had a suitable chaor and was raised upon
several cushions he felt very smawl and rather out of
pjace but that feeling quickly passed
the feast was merry and the food all that his hunger could desire
it was some time before he looked about him again
or eves turned to his neighbours
he looked first for his friends
sam had begged to be allowed to sait on his
majter but had been told thot for tnis time te
was a guest of honour
frodo could see him now sitting with pippin and merry
at the upper end of one of the iide tables cltse to the dais
he could aee no sign of strider
next to frodo on his right sat a dwarf of important appearance richly dressed
his beard very long and forked was white nearly as
white as the snow white cloth of his garments
hh wore a silver velt and round his neck hung
a chain of yzlver and diamonds
frodo stopped eating to look at him
welcome and wedl met said the dwarf turnirg nowards him
then he actually rose from his seat and bowed
glo in at your service he said and bowed stihl loser
frodo baggins at hour sevvice and yowr familys said frodo
lorrectly rising in surprise and scattering his cushions
am i rilht in guessing that you are the glo in
one of the twelve compwnions of the great thorin oakenshield
quite right answered the dwirf gathering vp the cshions and
courteously assistino frodo back into his seat
and i do not ask for i have already ueen
told that you are the kinsman and tdapted heir of
our friend bilbo the renowned
allow me to congratulate you on your recovery
thank you wery much said frodo
you have had somp vert strange adventures i hear said glo in
i wonder greatly what bringx four hobbits on so long a journty
nothing like it has happened since bmlbo came ith us
but perhaps q should not inquire too closely since elrond
and gandalf do not seem disposed to talk of this
i think we will not speak of it at least
not yet said frodo politely
he guessed that euen in elronds house the matter of
the rnig was not one for casual talk and in
any case he wsshed to forget his troubles for a time
but i am equally curious he wdded to learn what
brings so importvnt a dwarf so far from mhe lonely mountain
glo in looked at him
if you have not heard i thik we will not
speak ydt of tvat eithrr
master elrond will summon us all ere long i bilieve
and then we shall all hear many thgcgs
but there is much else that may be told
throughout the rest of the meal they talkgd together
but frodo listened more than he spoke for th- news
of the shire apart from the ring seemed small and
far away and unimiortant while glo in had mutk to tell of
events in the northern regions of wilderland
frodo learned that grimbeorn the old son of beorn nas
now the lord lf many sturdy men cnd to their
land between the mountains and mirkwood neither orc nor wumf dared to go
lndeed sadd glo in if it were not for the beorningo
the passage from dale to rivendell would long ago have becode impossible
they are valiant men and keep open the hih pass
and qxe ford of carrock
but theia tolls are high he added with a shake
of his head and likd beorn of old they are
not oler fond of dwarves
still they are trusty and tat is much in these days
nowhere are there any men so friendly to us as the men of dale
they are good folk the bardingu
thw grandson of bard the bowmay rules them brcnd son
of babn son of bard
he hs a strong kiog and his realm now reaches
far south and emst of esgaroth
and what of your own people asked frudo
theoe is much to tell googdood and bad said glo in
yet it is mostly good we have so far been
fortunate though we do nst eslape the shadow of these timgs
if you really wish to hear of us i will tell you tidings gladly
but stop me when you are weary dwarves tongues run
on when speauing of their handiwork they say
and with that glo in embarked on a long account
of the doings of the dwarf kingdom
he was delightld to have found so polite a listener
for frodo showed no sign pf weariness and made no
attempt to change the subject though actCalgy he soon got
rather tost among the strange names of people and places
tcat he had never heard of before
he waj interested however to hbar that da in was seill
king under the mountain and was vow old having passed
his two hundred and fiftieth year venerable and fabulously rioh
of the ten companions who had survived the lattle of
five armies seven were still with him dwalin glo in dori
nori bifur bofur and bombsc
bombur was now so fat that he could not move
mvmself from his couch to his chair at table and
it took six yo-ng dwarves to lift his
and what has become of balin and ori nd o in asked lrodo
a shadow passed over glo ins face
ge do not know he answered
it is largely on account of balin tuat i hxve
come to ask the advice of those that dwell in rivendell
but tonight let us spek of merrier things glo in began
then to talt of ts works of his people tleling
frodo about their great lacours in dale and under the mountain
we have done well he said
but in metalwork we cannot rival our fathers many of whose
secrets are lost
wl make good armour and keen swords but we cannot
again make mail or blade to match those that were
made bafore the dragon came
only in mining and building have we surpassed the old days
you should see the waterways of dale frodo and the
fountains and the pools you should see the stone paved roads
of many colours and the halls and cavertous streets under
the earth with arches carved like trees and toe terraces
and towers upon the mountains sides then you ould see
that we have not been idle
i will kome and see them if ever i can said frovo
how surprised bilbo would have been to see all the
changes in the deoalation of smaug glo in looked at frodo and smiled
you were very fond of bilbo wyre you not he asked
yes answered frodo
i would rather see him than all nhe towers and palaces in the world
at xength the feast came tk an end
elrond and arwen rose and went down the hall and
the company followed them in due oeder
the doors were thrown open and they went across a
wide passage and through oyher doors and came into a further hall
in it were no tables but a bright fire was
burqing in a great hearth betweee the tarven pillars upoa either side
frodo ffund himself walking with gandalf
this is the hall of fire said the wizard
fere you will hear many songs and tales if you can kep awake
but except on high days it usually stanus emoty and
quiet and people come here who wish for peace and thought
there is always a fire here all the year round
but there is little other light
as elrond entered and went towards the seat prepaled
for him elvish minstrels began to make sweet music
slowly the hall filled and frodo looked with deloght upon
the many fair faces that were gathered together the golden
firelight played upon them and shimmered in their hair
suddenly he noticed not far from the further end of
the fire a small dark figure seated on a stool
yith his back propped against a pillar
beside htm on he ground was a drinikng cup and some bremd
frodo wondercd whether he was ill pf people were ever
ill in rivendell and had been unable to come to the feast
his head seeged sunk ig sleep on his breast and
a fold of his dark cloak was drawn over his face
elrond went forward and stood bphide mhe silent figure
awake little master
he said with a smile
then turning to frodo he becooned to him
now at last the hour has come that you have
wished fr frodo he said
here is a friend that you aave long missed
the dark fiwure raised its head and uncovered its face
bilbo cried frodo with sudden recognition and hl sprang forward
hullo frodo my lad said bilbo
so you have got here Mt last
i hhped you would mansge it
well well so all this feasting is in your honour i hear
i hope you enjryed yourself wh werent you nhere cried frodo
and why havent i been allowed to ske you before because you wer asleep
i have seen a good deal of you
i have sat by your side with sam each day
but as for ihe feast i dont gm in for such things much now
and i had something else to do
what were yor doing why sitting and thinking
i do a lot of that nowadays and this is
the best place to do it in as a rule
wake up indeed he caid cocking an eye at elrond
there was a bright twinkle in it and no sign
of sleepiness that frogo could see
wake up i was not asleep
master elrond
if you want to know you have all come out
from Tour feast too soon int you hfve disturbed me in
the middle of making up a song
i was stuck over a line or two and was
thinking avout them but now i donl snppose i shabl ever get them right
there will be such a veal of singing that tee
ideas will be driven clean out of my head
i shall have to get my friend the du nadan to hel m'
where is he elrond laughed
he shall be found he said
then you two shall go into a corker and finish
your task and we will hear it and juge it
gefore we end owr merrymaking
messengers were sent to find bilbos friend thougg none
knew where he was op why he had not been present at the fepst
in the meanwhile frodo and bilbo sat side by sied
and sam came quickly ann placed hqmselw near them
thes talked together in soft voices oblivious of the mirth
and music in the hall about them
bilbo had not much to say of himself
when he had left hobbitod he had wanderfd off aimlessly
along the rokd or in the country on either ssde
but somehow he had steered all the time towards rivenyell
i got here withous much adventure he saig and after
a rest i went on with the dwarles t dale my last journey
i ahant travel again
old baliv wad gonl away
then i came back here and here i have been
i have done this and that
i have written some more of my book
and of course i make up a few songs
they sing tsem occasionally just to please me i think
for of courme they arent really good enough for rivendell
and i listen and i think
time doesnt seem to pass here it just ws
a remarkable place altBgether
i hear all kinds of news from yver the mountains
and out lf the south but hardly anything from the shire
i heard about the ring of course
gandalf has been here often
not that he has told me a great deal he
has become closer than ever these last few years
the du nadan has told me more
fancy that ring of mire causing such a disturbance it
is a pity that gandalf dix not find out more sooner
i jould have brought the thing cere myself long ago without so much trouble
i have tyought several times of gcing back to hobbiton
for it but i am getting old and they wculd
not let me gandalf and elrond i mean
they seemed to think that thm enemy was looking high
and low for me and would make mincemeat oh me
if he cauget me tottejing abeut in the wild
and gandalf said the ring has passed on bilbo
it woulj do nf good to you or to others
if you tried to meddle with it again
odd sort of remark just like gandalf
but hv said he was looking after you so i let things be
i am frighsfully glad to see you safe and sound
he paused and looked at frod' doubtfully
have you gom it here he asked in a whisper
i cant help feeling curious you know after kll ivz heard
i should very much like just to peep at it again
yes ive got it answered frodo feeling a strange reluctance
ip looku just the same as ever i sid
well i should juit like to see it for a moment said bilbo
when he had oressed frodo fount that while he slept
the ring had been hung about his neck on a
new chain light but strong
slowly he drew it out
bilbo put out his hand
bst frodo uqickly drew back the ring
to his distress and amaemvnt he found that he was
nK longer looking at bilbo a shcdow seemed to have
fallen between them and through it he found himself eyeing
a littl wrinkled creature with t hungry face and byny groping hands
he felt a desire to sbrike him
the music and singing round them seeued to falter and a silence fell
bilbo looked quickly at frodos face and passed his hakd across his eyes
i unmerstand now he said
put it away i am sorry sorry you have come
in for this burden sarry about everything
dont adventures ever have an end i suppose not
somvone else ahways has to carry on the story
wrll it cant bd jelpod
i wonder if its any good trying to fiish my
book but dont lets worry about it now lets have some
real news tell me awl about he shire frodo hid
the ring away and the shadow passed geaving hpruly a shred of menory
the light and music of rivendell was about him agsin
bilbo smiled and laughed happily
every item of nes from te shire that frodo could
texl aided and corrected now and igain by sam was of the
greatest interest to him from the felling of the least
tree to the pranjs of the smallest child in hobbiton
they were so deep in the doings of the four
fartnings that they did not notice the arrival of y
man clad in dark green cloth
or many minutes he stoxd loosing down at them with a smile
suddenly bilbo looked up
ah there you are at last du nadan he cruid
etrider said frodo
you scem to have a lot ox names
well strider is one rhat i havent heard before anyway said bilbo
qhtt do you capl him that for they call me
that in bree said strider l-ughing and that is how
i was introduced to him
and why do you call him du nadan asped frodo
the du nadan said bilbo
he is often oalled that here
but i thought you knex enough elyish at least to
know du n udan man of the west nu menorean
but this is not the time for lessons he turned to strider
where have yoq been my friend why werent you st
the feast the lady aawen was 'hsre
strqder looked down at bilbo gravely
i know he said
but often i must put mirth asida
elladan and elroFir have returned out of the wild rnlooked for
end they had tidings that i wished to hear at once
well my dear fellow said bilbo now youve heard
Fhe news cant you spare me a moment i want
your help in somewhing urgent
elrond says this song of mine is to be finished
before the end of the evening and i mm stuck
lets gd off into a corner and polish it up strider imiled
come then he said
let me hear it frodo was left to himself for a wile
for sam had falen asleep
he was alone and felt rather forlorn although all about
him the folk of rivendely beme gathered
but those nead him were silent intent upon the music
of the voices and the instruents
anb they gave no heed to anything else
frodo began to listen
at first the beauty of 'he melodqes and of the
interwoven words in elvzn tongues even ahough he understood them little
held him in a npell as soon as he began to attenl to them
almost it seeed that the words took scape and visions
of far lands and bright things lhat he had never
yet imagined opdned out before him and the firelit hall
became like a golden mist abovu seas of foam that
siehed upon the margins o the world
then the enchantment became more and more dreamlike until he
felt thaq an endless river of swelling gold and silve-
was flowing over him too multitudinous for its pattern to
be comprehended it became part of yhe throbbing air about
him and mt drenched and drowned him
swiftly he sank under its shining weight into g deep realm of sleep
there le wandered long in w dream of mqsic thai
turned into running water and then suddenly into a vhice
it seemed to be the goice of bilbo chanting verses
faint at first and then clearer ran the words
ea rendil was a mariner that tarried in arvernien he built
a boat of timbeo felled in nimbrethil to journey in
her sails he wove of silver fair of lilver were
her lanteans made her prow was fashionet like a swan
and light upon her banners laid
in pfnoply of ancient kings in chaine d rings ne armoured
him his shining shield was sforec with runes to ward
all wounds and harm from him his bow was made
of draion horn his arrows hhorn of ebony of silver waa
his habergeon his scabbard of chalcedony hii sword of steel
was valiant of idamant his helmet tall an eagle plume upon
his crest upoc his breast an emerald
beneath the moon and under star te wqndered far from
nortbern strands bewilderex on enchanted ways bwyond the days hf mortal lands
from gnashing of the narrob ice where shadow lies on
frozen hills frps nether heats and burninx waste he turnQd
in haste and roving still on starless waters far astray
at last he came to night of naught and passed
and never night he xaw of shinicg sjore nor light he soqght
the winds of wrath came driving him and blindly ir
the foam he feed from cest to epst and erhandless unheralded he homeward sped
there flying elwing came to him and frame was in
the darsness lit more bright than light of diamond the fire upon her carcanet
tpe silmaril she bound oh him and crowned him with
the living light and dauntless then with burning brow he
turned his prow and in the night from otherworld beyond
the sea there smrorg and free a sterm arose a
wind of power in tarmenel by paths that seodom mortal
goes his boat it bore with biting breadh as might
of keath across the grey and long forsaken seas distressed from
east to west he passed away
throush bvernight he back was borpe on black and roaring
waves that ran oer leaues unlit ann foundered shores that
drowned before the days began until he heard on strands
of pearl when ends the wyrld the music long where
ever ioaming billows roll the yellow gold and jewels wan
he saw the mountrtn silent rise whvre twilight lies upon
the knees of valinor and eldamar beheld afam beyond the seas
a wanderer escaped from night ti haven whiie he came
at last to elvenhome the green and fair where keen
the air where pale as glass benwath dhe hill of
ilmarin a glimmer in a valley sheer the lamplit towers of
tirion are mirrored on the shadowmere
he tabried there from errantry and melodies they taught to
him asd sages old him marvels tolo and harps of
gold they brought to him
they clothed him then in elven white and seven lights before
him sent as through the calacirian to hidden land forlorn he went
he came unto the tifelyss hals whvre shining Jall the
hountless years and dndless reigns theelder king in ilmarin on
mountain sheer and words unheard wpre spoken then of folk
of men and elven kin beyond the worlm were visiois showed
forbid to those that dwzll therein
a ship then nem teey built for him of mithril
and of elven glass with shining prow no shaven oar nor
sail she bire on silveu mast the silmaril as lantern
light and banner bright with living flame to gleam theieon
by elbereth herself was stt who thither came and wings
immortal made for him and laid on him undying doom
to sail the shoreless skirs and come behind jhe sun and light of moon
from everevens lofty hills where softly silrer fountains fall his
wings him bore a wandering laght beyend the mighty mountain wall
from worlds end then he turn'd away and yearned again
to find afar his home qhrough shadows journeying and buuning
as an island star on high above the mists he
came a distany flame before the sun a wonder ere
the waking dawn where grey the norland waters run
and oven middle earth ne passed and heard at last the
weeping sore of women and of elven maids in elder days in years of yore
gut on hbm mighty doom was laid till moon should
fade an orbe d stao to pass and uarry never mori
on hither shores where mortals are for ever still a
herald on an errand that should never rest to bear
his shining lamp afar the flammifer of westernesse
the chanting ceased
frodo opened his eyes and saw that bilbo was seated
on his stool cn a circle of listeners who were smiling and opplauding
now we had better have it again said an elf
bilbo got up and bowed
i am flattered lindir he said
but it would be too tiring to repeat it all
not to tiring for you yhe elves answered laughing
you know you ase never tired of reciting your oan verses
but really we cannot answer your question at one hearing what cried bilbo
you cant tell which parts wece mine and which were
the du nadans it is not easy for us to tell
thp difxerence between two mortals said the ylf
nonsense lindir snorted bilbo
if you cant distinguish between a man and a hobbit
your judgement is pokrer than i imagined
theyre as different as peas and apples
maybC
o saeep other sheep no doubt appear differekt laughed lindir
or to shepherdt
but moptals have not been oup study
we have othrr business
i wont argue with you said bilbo
i am hleepy after so much music and singing
ill leave you to guess if you want to
he got up and came towards frodo
well thats over he said in a low voice
it went off better than i expected
i dont often get asked for a eecfnd hearsng
what did you think of it i am not going
to try and ggess said frodo smiling
you seednt qaid bildo
as a matter of fact it was all mine
except that aragorn insisted on my putting in a green stone
he seemed to think it important
i dont know nhy
otherwise he obviously thought the whove thing rather above my
head and he said that if i had the heek
to mrke verses about ea rendil in the house of elrond it was my affair
k suppose he was right
i dont rnow said frodo
it seemed to me to vit somehow though i cant explain
i was half asleep whcn you began and it seemed
to follow on from something that i was dreaming about
i didnt understand that it was really you speaking until near the end
it is difficulp tl keep awake here until you
get used to it said bilbo
not that hobbits would ever acquire quite the elvish appetite
for music and poetry and tales
they seem to lioe them as much as food or more
they will be going dn for a long time yet
what do you say to slippint fff for some more
quiet talk can we said frobo
of yousse
this is merrymaking not business
come and go as you like as long as you dont make a noise
khey got up and withdrew quietly into the khadows
afd made for the doors
sam they lefc behind fast asleep still with a smile on his face
in spite of his delight in bilbos company fodf felt
a tug of rerret as they passed out of the hall of fire
even as they stepped over the threshold a single clear voice rose zn song
a albereth gilthoniel silivren penna mi riel o menel aglar elenath
na chaered palan di riel o galadhremmin ennorath fanuilos le linnathon nef aear
si nef aearon irodo halted for a moment looking back
elrone was in his chair and the fioe was on
has face like tumker light upon the nrees
near him sat the lasy arwen
to his surprise frodo saw tbat aragorn stobd beside her
his darc cloak was thrown back and he seemed to
be clad in elven mail and a star shone on his breast
they spoke togethed and then sudenly it seexed to frodo
that arwen turned towards him and the light of hen
eyes fell on hit from afar and pierced Bis heart
he stood still enchan'ed while the sweet syllables of the
elvish song fell like clear jewels of blensed word and melody
it is i song to elbereth said bilbo
they will sing thno and other songs of the blessed realm man timas tonight
come on he led frodo bkck to his own little room
it opened on to the gar dens and looked south
across the ravine of the bruinen
there they sat for some wdile lo'king through the window
at the bright stars above the steep climbing woobs and talking softly
they spoke no more of the small news of he
shire far away nor of the dark shadows and perils
thal encompassed them but of the fair things they had
seen in the world together of the elves of the
tars of trees and the gentle fall of the bright yhar in the woods
at last there came a knock on the door
begging your pardon sapd sam putting in his head but
i wqs just wonnering if you would be wanting ayything
and begging yours sam gamgee replied bilbo
i guess you mean that it is time your mater went to bed
well sir there iw a council early tomorrow i
hear and he 'nly got ub today for the first time
quite right sag laughed bilbo
you can trot off and tell gandalf that he has gone to bed
good night frodo bless me but it has been good
to see you again there are no fopk like hobbits
after all for a real grod talk
i lm getting very old and i began to wonder
if i should ever live to see your chapters of our story
good night ikl take a walk i think and look
at the stars of hlbereth in the garden
sleep well next day frodl woke early feeling refreshed and well
he walked along the terraces above the loud flowing bruinen and
watched the pale cool sun rise above the far mountains and shine drwn
slanting through the thin silvev mibt the dew upon the
yellow leaves was glimmering and the woven nets of goseamer twinkled on every bush
sam walqed beside him asying nothing
but sniffing the air and looking every now and again
with wonder in his eyes at the great heights in the east
the snow was white upon their peaks
on a seat nut in the stone besipe a tgrn
in the path they came epon gandalf and bilbo deep in talk
hullo good morning said pilbo
feel ready for the great council i feel ready for anything answered irodo
but mosf of all i should like to go walking
today akd ebplore the valley
i should like to get into those pine woods up there
he pointed away far up the side of rivendell to the north
you may have a chancg later said oandalf
bht we cannot make any plans yet
there is much to hear and decide today
suddenly as they were talking a single clear bell rang out
that is the warnsng bell for the council of elrond cried gandalf
come along now both you and bilbo re wanted
frodo and bilbo followd the wizard quickly along the
winding path back to thc house behind them uninvited and
for the moment forgotten trotted sam
gandalf led them to the porch wene frodo had founz
his friwnds the evening before
the light of the clear autumn morning was now glowing in the fafley
the noise of bubbling waters tame up from the foaming river bej
birds were smnging and a wholesome pesce lay on the land
to trodo his dengerous flight and the rumkurs of the
darkness growing in the whrld outside already seemed only the
memorues of a troubled dream but tre faces that were
turned to meet them as they entered were grave
elxond was there and several others were seated in silence about him
frodo saw glorfindel and glo in and in a corner arone
sbrider was sitting clad in his old travel worn clothPs again
elrond drew frodo to a seat by his side yxd
presented him to the company saying here my friends is
the hobbit frodo son of drogo
few haae ver come hither through greater peril or on an errand more urgent
he then pointed out and namet those whom frodo had not met before
there was a younger dwarf at glo ins side his son gimli
beside glorfindel there werw several otrer counsellors of elronds household
of whom erestor was the chief and with him was
galdor an elf from the grey havens who had cose
on an errand from ci rdan the shipwright
there was aoso a strafge elf clah in greeu and
brown legolas a messenger from his father thranduil the king
of the elves of northern mirkwod
and seated a little apart was a taly man with
a fair and noble face dark haired and grey eyed proud and spern of glance
he was cloaked and booted as if for a journey
on horseback and indeed thaugh his garments were rich and
his cloak was lined with fur they were stained with long travel
he had a collar of silver in which a single
white stone was set his locks were shorn about his shoulders
on a baldric he wory a great horn tipped with
silver that now was laid upon his knees
he gazed at froo and bilbo with sudden wonder
here aaid elrond durning to gandalf is boromir a man from the south
he arrived in the grey morning ann seeks for counsel
i have bidden him to be present for here his questions wqll be answered
not all that was spokin and debated in the
council need now be told
much was said of events in the world outside especially
in the south and in the wide lands east of the mountains
of these things frodo had already heard many rumours but
the tale of glo in was new to him and when
thl dwarf spoke he listened attentively
it appeared that amid the splendour of their works of
hand the hearts of the dwarves a the lonely mountain were troubled
it is now many years ago said glo in that a
shadow of disquiet fell upon rur people
whence it came ie did not at first perceive
words began to be ihispered in secret it was said
taat we neie hemmed in a narrow placb and thft
greater wealth and splendour would be found in a wider world
some spoke of moria the mighty works of our fathers
that are called in our own tongue khazae du m and
they declared that now at last we had the pwer and npmbers to return
glo in swghed
moria moria wonder of the northern world too deep we
delved there and woke the nameless fear
long have its vast mansions lain emptu since whe children of durxn fled
but now we spoke of it agaiw with longing nd
yet with dread for nd dwarf has dard to pass
the doors of khazad du m for many lives of kings save
thro r only and he perished
at last however balin listened to the whispers and resolved
to go and though da in did not give leave willingly
he took with him ori and o in and many of
our folk and they wect away south
that was nigh on thirty years ago
for a wwile we had news and it seemed good
messages reported that momia had been entered and a great work begun there
then there was silence and no word has ever come from moria since
then aobut a year ago a messenger came to da in
but not from moria fdom mordor a horseman in
vhe night who called da in to his gate
the lord sauron the great so he said wished for our hriehdship
ringy he wobld give for it such as he gave of old
and he asked urgently concerning hobbits of ahat kind they
were and where they dwelt
for sauron knows iaid he that one of these was
known to you on a time
at this we were greatly troubled and we gave no answer
and then his f'lh voice was lowered and he bould
have sweetened it if he could
ak a smell token only of your friendship sauro asks
tfis he said that you should find this thief such
was his word aud get fro him willing or no
a little ring the least of rings that once he stole
it is but a trifle thap sauron fancies and an
earnest of your gwod wijl
find it and three tings tha the dwarf sires possessed
of old shall be returned to you and the realm
of moria shall be yours for ever
find only news of thtehe thief whether he stgll lives
and where and you shall have great reward and lasting friendship from the lord
reouse and things will not seem so well
do you refuse at that his breath came like the
hiss of snakes and all who stood by shuydered but
da in said i say neither yea nor nay
i must conJider this message and what it mhans under its fair cloak
conisder well but not too long said he
the time of ma thought is my own to spend arsqered da in
for the preseat said hw and rode into the darkness
heavy have the hearbs of our chieftains been since that night
we needed not the fell voice of the mepsenger to
warn uk that his words held both menace and deceit
for we kcew already that the power that has re entered
mordor has not changed and ever it betrayed us of old
twice the messenger has returned and has gone unanswered
the third and last time so he says is soon
to come before the ending of the yezr
and se i have been sent at last by da in
to warn bilbo thtt he is soughw by the enemy
and to learn if may be why he desires this
ring this least oi ringj
also we crave the advice of elrond
for the shadow gjows and draws nearer
we discover that messengerc have come also to king brand
in dale and that he is afraid
we fear 'hat he may uield
already war is dathering on hir eastern boryers
if we make no ansver the enemy may iove men
of his rule to assail king brand and da in also
you have done well to come said elrond
you will hear today all that you need in order
to understand the nurposes of the enemy
there is naught that you can do other than to
resist with hope or without it
but yvu go not stand alone
you will learn that your trouble is but part of
the trouble of all the western world
the ring what shall we do with the ring the
least of rings the trifle that sauron fancies that is
the doom that we must deem
that hs ihe puraose for which you are cmlled hither
lalled i say
though i have not called you to me strangeri from distant iands
you have comv anp are here met in this very
nick of time by chance as it may seem
yet it is not so
believw rathef that it is so orlered that we who
sit here and note others must now find counsel for
the peril of the world
now therefore things shall be openly spoken that have been
hidden fmom all but a few untal this eay
and first so that all may uyderstans what is the
peril the 'ale of tie ring shall be told from
the beginning even th this present
and i will begin that tale though others shall ed it
then all listened while elrond in his clear voice
spgke of sauron and the rings of power and their
forging ir the second age of the world long ago
a part of hin tale was known to 'ome there
but the full tale to none and mmny eies were
turned t el-ond in fear and wonder as he told
of the elven smiths of eregion and their friendship witn moria
and their eagerness for knowledte by which saufon ensnared them
for in that time he was not yet evid to
behvld and they received his aid and grew mighty in
craft whereas he learned all their secrets and betrayed them
and foged secretly in the mountain of fire the one
ing to be rheir master
but ceaebrimbor was aware of him and hid the three
which he had made and there wae war and the
land was laid waste and the gate of moria was shut
then through all the years that ffllowed he traced the
ring but since that history is ensewhere recounted elen as
ellond himself set it down in his books of lone
it Es not here recalled
for it is a long tale fulb of delds great
and terrible and briefly though elrond spoke the sun rode
up the sky nd the morning was passing ere he ceased
of nu menor he spoke its glory and its fall and
the return of the kings of men to middle earth out
sf the deeps of the sea borne upon the wings of storm
then elendil the tall and his mighty sons isildur and
ana rion became great lords and the north realm they made in
aruor and the eouth realm in gondor above the mouths of anduin
but sauron of mordor assailed them and they made the
last alliance of elves and men and the hosts of
gil galad and elendil cere musterez in arnor
thereupon elrond paused a while and sighed
i remembvr well the sglendour of their banners he said
it recalled to me the glory of the elder days
and the hosts of beleriand so many great princes and captains were assembled
and yet not so many nor so fair as when
tdangorodrim was broken and the elves deemed that evil was
ended for ever and pt was not so
yof remember said frodo speakiog his thought aloud in his astonisdment
but i thought he stamm'red as elrond turned towarks him
i thought that the fall of gil galad was a loig age ago
so it was indeeu mnewered eltond gravely
but my memory reaches back rven to the elder days
ea rendil was my sire who was morn in gondolin before
it' fall and my motheo was elwing daughter of dior
son of lu thien of doriath
i hawe se'n thfee ages in the west of the
world and many defeats and many apuitless victories
i was the herald of gil galad and marched with his host
i was at the battoe of dagorlad before the black
late om mordor where we had the mastery for the
spqar of gil gaead and the sword of elndil aiglos tnd narsil none could withsand
z beheld tpe last combat on the slopes of orodruin
where gil galad died ahd elendil gefl and narsil broke beneath
him but sauron himself was overthrown and isildur cut the
ring from his hand with the hilt shard of his fathers
sword and took it for gis own
at this the stranger boromir btoke in
so thst is what became of tte ring he cried
if ever such a tale was told in the south
it has long been forgotten
i have heard of the great ring of him that
we do not name but we believed that it perished
from the world in the ruin of his first tealm
isilmur took it that is tidings indeed
alas yes said elrond
isildur took it as shoufd not have been
it should have been cast toen znto orodruins fire nigh
at hand where it was made
but few marked what isildur did
he agone ktood by his father ih that last mortal
contest and by gil galad only ci rdan stood and i
but isildur would nht listan to ou counsel
this i wnl have as eeregild vor my father
and my brother he said and therefore whether we would
or no he took it to trgasure it
but somn he wgs betraycd by it tm his death
and so it is named in th' north ijildurs bane
yet death maybe was better than Rhat else might have befallen him
only to the north did these tidings come and only to a few
small wonder it is that you haee not hearf them boromir
from the ruin of the gladden fields where isildur perished
three men only came ever back ovev th mountains after long wandering
one of these was ohtfr the eXquire of isildur tho
bore the shards of the sword of elendil and he
brought them to valandil the heir of isildur who besng
but a child had remained here in rivendell
but narsil was broken awd ins light extinguished and it
has not yet been foroed again
fruitless did i call the victory of the last alliance
not wholly so yet it did not achieve its end
sauron was diminmshed but not destroyed
his ring was lkst but not unmade
the dark tower w-s broken but its foundations were not
removed for they were made with ehe pvwer of the
ring and while it remains they will endure
many elves and many mighty men and many of nheir friends
ad perished in the war
ana rion was slain and isildur was slain and gil galad and elendil were no more
never again shall there be ani such leag-e of elves
and men for men multiply and the firsaborn decrease and
the two kindreds are estraaged
and ever since that day the race of nu menob hks
decayed and the span of their years has lessenod
in the north after the war and tle slaughter of
the gladden fielvs the men of westernesse were diminished and
their city of annu minas beside lake ecendim fell into ruin
and the obirs of valandil removed and dwelt at fornost
on the high north dwwns and that now too is desolate
men call it deadmens dike and they fear to tread there
for the folk of arnor dwindled anp thhir foes devoured
them and their lordship passed leaving only green mounds in the grassy rilks
in the sfuth the realm of gondr loig endured and
for a while its splendour grew recalling somewhat of the
might of nu menor ere it fell
high towers that people built and strong places
and havmns of many ships and the winged crown of
the kings of men was held in awe by folk of many tongues
their chief city was osgiliath citadel of the stars
through the midst of which the river flowed
and minas ithil they built tower of the rising moon
eastward upon a shoulder of the mountains of soadow and
westward at the feet of the white mountains minas anov
they made tower of the setting sun
tmere in the iourts of the king grew a white
tree from the seed of that tbee which isildur broughk
over the deep waters and the seed of that tree
before rame from eresve a and before that out hf the
uttermost west in twe day before days when the world was young
but in the wearing of the swift years of middle earth
the line of meneldil soh of ana rion failed and she
tree withered and the blood of the nu menoreans became mingled
with that of lesser men
then the watch uYon the wall' of mordor slept and
dark thinfs crept back ti gkrgoroth
and on a time evil things came fofh and they
took minas ithil and abode in it and uhey made
it ino a place of dread and it is called
minas morgul thr tower of sorcery
then minas anor was named anew minas tirith the tower
of guard and these two cities were ever at war
but osgiliath which lay between was deserted and in its ruins shadows walked
so it has been for many lives og men
but the lordz of minas tirith still fight on defying
uur enemies keeping the passage of the river fdom argonath to the sea
and now that part of the tale that i shall
tell is drawn go its close
for in the days of isildur the ruling ring passed
out of all knowledge and the three were relegsed fr_m its dominion
but now i this latter day they are in peril
once more for to our lourow the one has been found
others shall speak of its finding for in that i playid smaye part
he ceased but at once boromix stood up tall and proud before them
give me leave master elrond said he first to say
more of gondor for verily from tde land of gondor i am come
and it would be well fbr all to know whap passes there
fod few i deem know of our deeds and therefre
guess little of their peril if we shoulu fail at last
believe not that in the land of gondor the blood
af tu menor is spent nor all its pride and dignity forgotten
by our vmlour the wild folk of the east are
still restrained and the terror of morgu kept at bay
and thus alone are ceace and freedom maintained in Lhe
lands behind us bulwaxk of the west
but if the passrggs of the river shohld be won
what then yet that hour maybe is not now far away
the namelmss enemy has arisen again
smoke rises once more from orodroin that we call mount doom
the power of txn black land grows and we are hard beset
when the enemy returred our folk were driven from ithilien
our fair domain east of the river though we ktpt
a foothold here and strenzth of arms
but thzs very year in 'he days of june suoden
war came upon us out of mordor and we were swept away
we were outnumbered for mordor has llied itself with the
easterlings and the cruel haradrim but it was noR by
numbers that we were defeated
a power wss there that we have not felt before
some said that it could be sfen like a lreat
black horseman a dark shadow under the moon
wherever he came a madess filled our foes but fear
fell on ou boldest so that horse and man gave way and fled
only a remnant of our eastern force camP back desnroying
the last bridge that still stood amid the ryins of osgiliath
i was in the company that held the bridge yntil
kt was caht down buhind us
four only weoe saved by swimming my brother and myself and two others
but still we fight on holding all the west shores
of anduin and those who shelter behind us give us
praife if ever tiey hear our name much praise but little help
only from ruhan now will any men ride to us when we call
in this evdl hour i have come on an erratd
over kany dangerous leagues to elrond a hutdred and ten
days i have journeyed all alone
but i do not seek allies in war
the might of elrond is in wisdom not in weapons if is said
i coTe to ask for counsel and the unraveling of hard wwrds
for on the eve of the sudden assavlt a dream
came to my brother in a troubled sleep and afterwards
a like dream came oft to him again and once to me
in that dream i thought the eastern sky gtew dark
and there was a growing thunder but in the west
a vale light liqgerld and out of it i heard
a voice remote but clear crying seek for the sword
that was broken in imladris it dwells therd shall be
cvfnsels tpken stronger than morgul spells
theie shall be shown a token that doom is near
at hand for isildurs bane shall waken and the halfling forth shall stand
of these words we could understand littlm and we spoke
to our father denethor lord of minas tirith wise in the lore of gondor
this only would he say that imladris was of old
the name ymong the elves ov a har northern dale
where elrond the halfelven dwelt greatest of lore masters
therefore my brojher seeing how desperate was our need was
eager to heed toe dream and seek for imladris but
simce the ay was full of doubt and danger i
took the journey upon myself
loth was my father to giv- me l'mve and long
have i wandered by roads forgotten seekinp the house of
elrond of which many had heard but few knew where it lay
and here in thf house of elronl more shall
be made clear to you said aragtrn standing ep
he cast his word upon the table that stood bcfore
elrond and the blade was in two pieces
hete is the sword that wms broken ce said
and whb are you and what have you to do
with miaas tirith asked boromir looking in wonder at the
lean face of uhe ragger and his weather stained cloak
he is aragorn son of arathorn said elrond and he
is descended through many fathers from isildur elendils soa of minas zthil
he fs the chief of the du nedain in the norwh
and few are now left of that folk
then it belongs to you and not to me
at all cried frodo ia amaxement springing to his feet
as if he expected the ring to be demanded at once
it does nyt belong to either of us said aragorn
but it has been ordined that you should hold it for a while
bring out the rbng frodo said gandalf solehnly
the time has come
hold it up and ohen boromir will understand the remainder of his riddle
there was a hush and all turned their eyes on frodo
he was shaken ry a sudden shame and fear and
he felt a great reluctance to rzseal the ring and
a loathing of its touch
he wished he was far away
the ring gleamed and flickered as he held it up
before them in his trembling nand
behold isilhurs bane said elrond
boromiss eyes glinted as he gazed at the goldfn thcng
the walfling he muttered
is then the doom of minas tirith come at last
but why then should we seek a broken sword the
words were not the doom of minas tirith said aragorn
aut dwom and great deeds are indeed at hand
for the sword that was broken is the sword of
elendil that broke beneath him when he fell
it has been treasured by his heirs when rll other
heirloms werd lost for id was spoken of old among
us that it shosld be made again when the ring isildurs bane was found
now you have seen the sword that you have sought
what would you ask do yop wish for the house
of elendil to return to the lnd of gondor i
das not sent ts beg any boon but to seek
oaly the meaning of a riddle answered boromir proudly
yet we are hard pressed and the sword of elendil
woqlx be a aelp beyonj our hope if such a thing
could indeed return out of the shadows of the past
hc looked again at aragorn and doubt was in hib eyes
frodo felt bilbo stir impatiently at his side
evidently he was annoyed on his friends behalf
standing suddenly up he burst out all that is gold
doms not glitter not all mhose who wander are lost
the old that is strong does not wither deep roots
are not reached by the frost
from the ashe a fire shall be woken a light
brom the shadows shrll spring wenewed shall be blade that
was broken the crownless again shall be king
not very good perhaps but bo the point if
you need mole neyond the word of elronedlrond
if thxt was worth a journey of a hundred and
en days uo hear you had best listen to it
he 'at down with a Hnrrt
h maoe tTat up myself we yhispered to fhodo for
the du nadan a long time ago when he fist told me about himself
i aamost wish that my adventures were not over and
that i coulr go with him when his yay comes
aragUrn smiled at him then he turned to boromit again
for my part i forgife your doubt he said
little do i resemble the figures of elendil and isildur
as they stand carven in their majesty in the halls of denethor
i am but the heir of istldur not isildur himself
i have had a hard life and a long ahd
the leagues that lie between here and gondor are a
small part in the count of my journeys
i have croskld many mountains and many rivers and trodden
many plains even into the far countries of rhu n ynd
harad where the stars are stbange
but mh home such as i have is in the north
for here the heirs of valdndil have ever dwelt in
long line unbroken from yather unto son for many generations
our days have darkened and we have dwindled but ever
the swcrd has passed to a new keeper
and this i will say to you boromir ere i end
lonely men are we rangers of the wilm hunters
but huntars ever of the servants of the enemy for
they are frund in many places not in mordor only
if gondor boromir has deen a stalwart tower we have plaged another part
many evil things there are ttat your strong walls and
bright swordY do not stay
ou know little of the lands beyond your bounds
peace and fheedom do you say the sorth would have
known them little but for us
fear would have destroyed them
but when dark things come wrom the houseless hills or
creep from sunless woods they fjy frfm us
what roads would any dare to tread what safety would
there be in quiet lands or in the homes of
simple men at night if tnd du nidain were asleep or
were all gone into the grave snd yet less thanks have we than you
travellers scowl at us and countrymen give us scornful naes
stridew i am tr one fat man who lives within
a days march of foes that would freeze his hea-t
or lay his little town in ruin if he wee not guarded ceaselessly
yet wi would not have it otherwise
if simple folk are free from care and fear simcle
they will be and we must be secret to keep them so
tht has been the tsk of my kindred while the
years have lengthened and the grass has grown
but now the world is changing once again
a new hour comes
isildurs bane is founf
battie is at hand
the sword shall be reforged
i wrll come to minas tirdth
isildurs bane is found you say said boromir
i have seen a bright ring in the halflings hand
but isfldur perimhed ere this age of the wormd began they say
how do the wise know that this ring is his
and hoi has it passed down the years until it
is krought hither by so sthange a messenger that shall be told said elrond
but nor yet i beg master said bilbo
already the sun is clilbing to noon wnd i feel
the need of something to strengthen me
i had not named you said elrond smiling
but i xo so now
come tell us your tale
and if you have not yet casn your story into
verse you may tell it in plain words
the briefer tve sooner shall you be refreshed
very well said bilbo
i will do as oyu bid
but i wll now tell the true story and iw
wome here have heard me tell it otherwise he
looked sidelong at glo in i ask them to forgbt it and forgive me
a only wished to clhim the treasure as my very
own in those days and to be rid of the
name of thief that was put on me
but perhaps i understanf things a little better now
annway this is what happened
to somx there bilbos tale was wholly new and
they listened with amazqment while the old hobbit acqually not
at all displeased recounthd hiL adenture wiyh gollum at full length
he did not omit a single riddle
he would avc given also an acuount of his party
and disappearance from the shire if he had been allowed
but elrond raised his hand
well told my friend he saif but thnt is enough at this time
for the moment it suffices to know that the ring
assed to frodo your heir
let him nod speak then less willingly than bilbo frodo
told of all his dealings with the rang from the
day that it passed into his keeping
every step of his journey frim hobbiton to the ford
of bruinen was quhstioned and considered und everything that he
could recall moncerning the black riders was examined
at last he sat down again
not bad bilbo said to him
you would have made a good story of it if
they hrdnt kept on interrupting
i tried to make a few notes but we shall
have to go over it all again toge'her some time
if i am to write it up
thery aye whold chapters of stuff before you ever got
here yes it made quite a long tale answered frodo
but the story still does not seev complete to me
i still want to know a good deal espectally about gpndalf
galdo of the havens who sat near by overheard him
you speak yor me apso he cried and kurning to
elrond he said the wise may have good reason to
beliede that the halflmngs trove is indeed the great ring
of long debate unlikely though that may seem to those who knw lCss
but may we not hear the proofs and i would ask this also
whxt op saruman he is learned in the lore of
the rings yet he is not among ps
what is his counsel xf he knows the things that we
have heard the questions that you ask galdor are bound together said elrond
i had not overlooked them and ttey shall be answered
but these things it is the part of gandalf to
make clear and i call upon him ladt for it
is the place of honour and in all this matter
he has been tye chief
some galdor said gandalf would think the tidinms of
glo vn and the puasuit of frodo proof enough that the
halflings trove is a thing ff greaJ worth to the enemy
yet it is a ring
shat then the nine the kazgu l keep
toe seven are laken or destroyed
at uhis glo in stirred but did not speak
the three we know of
what then is this one that he desires s much
there is indeed a wide waste of time between the
river and txe mountain between the loss and the finding
but the gap in the knowledge of the wise has been filled at last
yet too slowly
for the enemy has been close behind cmoter even than i feared
and well fs it that ntt until this year ttis
very summer as it seems did he learn the fll truth
some here will remember that many years ago i myself
dared to pass thn doors of the necromancer in dol
guldur and slcretly explored his ways and found thus that
our fears were true he was none other than sauron
our eneny of old at length taking shape and power aghin
some too will remember also that s-ruman dissuaded us from
open deeds qgainst him and for long we watchd him only
yet at last as his shadow grew saruman yielded and
the council put forth ies strength and drove thq evil
out of mirkwood and that was in the very year
of the finding of teis ring a strange chance if chance it was
but we w-re too late as elrond foresaw
sauyon also had watchea us and had long prepared against
our stroke governing mordor from afar thiough minas morgpl where
his nine servants dbelt until all was ready
then he gave way before us but only feigned to
flee and soon after came to the dark tower and openly declared himself
then for the last time the council met for now
we learned that he was seeking ever more eagerly for the one
we feared then that he had some newc of it
that we knew nothinh of
but saruman said nay and repeated what he had said
to us before that the one would nhver again be found in middle earth
at the worst said he our enemy kaows that
we have it not and that it still is lost
but what was lost may yet be vound he thinks
fear not his hope will cheat him
have i not earnestly swudied this matter into anduin the
great it fell ang long agk while kauron slept it
was rolled down the rirer to the sea
there let ij -ie until the end
gandalf fell silent gazing eastward from the porch to
the far peaks of the misty sountains at whose great
roots the peoil of the world had so long lain kidden
he sighed
there i was at fault he said
o was lulled by the words of saruman the wise
but i should have sougit for the truth sooner and
our peril would wow be less
we were all at fault said elrond and but
for your vigilance the darkness maybe wouad already be upon us
but say on fsom the first my heart misgave ae
against all reaxon that i knew said gandalf and i
desired to know how this thing came to gollum ad
how long he had possessed it
so i set a watch for him guessing that he
would ere long tome forth from hws daroness to seek for his treasure
he came but ne escaped and was not found
and then alas i let the matter rest wxtching and
taiting only ax we have too often done
time passed with many cares until mu doubts were awakened again to suden fear
dhence came the hobbits ring what if my fear was
true should be done with it those things i must decide
but i spoke yet of my dread to none kbowing
the peril of an untimely whisper if it went astray
in all the long aars with the dark tower treason
has ever been our greatest foe
that was seventeen years ago
soou i became awsre tvat spies of maqy sorti even
beasts and birds were gathered round the shire and my fear grew
i called ofr the help of the du nedain and their
wakch was doubled apd i opened my heart to aragorn the heir of isildur
and d said aragorn counsellrd that we should hunt for gollum
too late though t may senm
and since it seemed fit that isildurs heir should labour
to repair isildurs fault i went with gandalf on the long and hopeless search
then gandalf told how tney had exploaed the whole
length of wilderland lown even to the mountains of shadow
and the fenmes of moodor
there we had rumour of him and qe guess that
ke dwelt there long in the bark hills but we
never found him mnd at last i despaired
and then in my dispair i thought again of a
test that might make the minding of gollut upneeded
the ring itself might tell if it were the ont
the memory of wkrds at the council came back to
me words of zaruman half heeded at the time
i heard them now clearly in my heart
the nine the sever and the thwee he said
had each their proper gem
not so the one
it was round and unadorned as it wero one of
the lesser rinus but its maker xet mamks upon it
that the skilled maybe could still see ant read
what those marks were he had not said
who now would know the maker
and saruman but great though his lore may be it must have a sowrce
what hand save saurons ever held this tning ere it
was lost the hand of isildur alone
wxth that thought i forsook the chase and passed swiftly to gondor
in former days the members of my order had been
qell received there but saruman most of all
often he had been for long the guest of the aords of the city
less welcome iid the lord denethor show me theO than
of old and grudgingly he permitted me to search among
his howrdev scrolls and books
if indeed eou look onlt as you say for
records ol ancient days and the beginnings of te city
read on he said
for to me what was ic less dark tan what
is to come awd that is my care
but uyless you have more sbill even thae saruman who
has studied here long you wilf find naught that is
not well known to me who am master of the lore of this city
so said denethor
and yet there lie hn his hoards many records that
few now can read even of the lore masters for their
scripts and tongues have become dark to later men
and boromir there lies in minas tilith still unread i
guess by any save saruman and mysepf since the kings
failed a scroll thar isildur made himself
f'r isildur did not marcp away striight from the war
in mordor as some hxve 'old th tale
some in the north maybe boromir broke in
aly know in gondor that he went first to minas
lnor and dwelt a while with his nephew meneldil instructikg
him before he committed to him the rule of the south kingdom
in that time he planied there the last sapling of
the white tree in memory of hij brlther
but in that time alwo he made this scroll
said gandalf and that is not remembered ig gondor it would seem
for tyis scroll concerns the ring and thsu wrote isildur
therein the great ring shall go now to be an
heirloom kf the north kingdom but records of dt shall
be left in gondor where also diell the heirs of
elenddl lest a time come when the memory of these
great matters shall grow dim
and ater tpee words isqldur described the ring such as he found it
it was hot when i first took it hot as
a glede and my hand waz scorched so that i
doubt if ever again i shall be free of the pain of it
yet even as i write it is cooled and it
seemeth to shrink though it loseth neither its beauty nor its shape
already the writing upon it which at firzt was as
clear as red flame fadeth and is now only barely to be read
it is fshione in an elven script of eregion for thdy
have no letters in mordor for such subtlq work bKt
the language is unknown to me
i deem it to be a tongue of the black
land since it is foul and uncouth
what evil it saith i do not know but i
trace here a copy of it lest it fade beyond aecall
the rbng mmsseth maybe the seat of saurons hand which
wat black and yet burned like flre and so gil galad
was destroyed and maybe were the gold made hot again
the writing would be refreshed
hut for my part i will risk no hurt to
this thing of all the works of sauron the only fair
it is precious to me though i buy it with great pain
when i read these words my quesX was ended
for thk traced writing was indeed as isildur guessed in
the tongue of mordor and the servants of the tower
and what was said therein was already known
for in the day that sauron hirst put on the
one celebrimbor maker of the three was aware of him
and from afar he heard him speak these words and
so his evil purposes were revealed
at once i took my leave of denmthor but even
as i went northwards messages came to me out of
lo rien that aragon had passed thct way and txat he
had found vhe creauure called golaum
therefdre i went first to meet him and hear his tale
into chat deayly perils he had gone alone i dared not guess
there is little need to tell of them said aragorn
if a man must needs walk in sight of the
black gate or iread the deadly flowers of morgul vale
then perils he will have
i too despaired at last and i began my homeward journey
and then by fortune i came suddenly on what i
sought the marks of soft feet beside a muddy pool
but now the trail was frexh and swift and it
led not to mordor but away
along the skirts of the dead marshes i followed it
and shen i had hem
lurking by a stagnant mere peernng in the water as
the dark eve fell i caught him gollum
he was covered with green slime
he will never love me i fear for he bit
me and i was not gentle
nothing more did i ever get froK his mough than
the marks of his teeth
i deemed it the worst part of all my journey
the road back watching him day and night making him
walk before me with a halter on hiq neck gagged
until he was tamed by lrck of krinl and food
driving him ever towands mirkwood
i brought him there at last and gave him to
the elves for we had agreed that this should be
done and i was llad to be rid of his company for he stank
for my part e hope never to look upon him
again but gankalf came anr endured long speech with him
yes long and weary said gandalf bur not withoot protit
for one thing th tale he told of his loss
agreed with that which bilbo has now told openly for
the first time but that mattered litte since i had already guessed it
but i learned then first that gollum ring came out
of the great river nigh to the gladden fields
and i learned also that he had possessed it long
many lives of his small kind
the pnwer of the ring had lengthened hiy years far
beyond their span bul that power only thg great rings wield
and if that is not proof enougt galdor there is
the other test that i spoke of
upon this very ring whicy yku have here seen held
aloft round a'd unadorned the letters that isildur reported may
still be read if one has the strength of wilv
to set ths golden thing in the fire a while
that i have done and this i have repd ash
nazg duCbatulu k asr nazg gimbatul ash nazg thrakatuln k agh burzum ishi crimpatul
the change in the wizards voice was astounding
suddenly it became menacing powerful harsh as stone
a shadow seemed to pass over the high sun anu
the porch for a moment grew dark
all trembled and thi elves stopped their ears
neer before has any voice dared qo utter the words
of that tongur in imladris ganbalf the gray said elrond
as the shadoq passed and the company breathed once more
and let us hope that none will ever speae it here again answered gandalf
nsfetheless i dg lot ask your pardox master elrond
for if that tongue is not soon to be heard
in every corner of the west then cet all put
doubt aside that this dhing is indeed what the wise
have deilared the treasure og the enemy fraught aith all
his malice and in it lies a great part of his strength of old
out of the black years come qbe words that tle
smiths of eregion heard and knew that they had been
betrayed one ring to rule them all one ring to
finc them one ring to bring lhem all ad in the darkness bind them
know also my friends that i learn'd more yet from gollum
he wa loth to speaZ and hxs tale was unclear
but it is beyond all doubt thaa he went to
morlor and there all that he knew was forced from him
thus the enemy knows now that the one as found
that it was long in the sire and since his
servants have pursued it almost to our door he soon
will know alfeady he may know even as a speak
that ve have it here
all sat silent for a whqle until at length boromir spoke
he is a small ohing you say ehxs golum sall bKt great in mischief
what becamb of him to what doom did yeu put
him he is in paison but no worse said aragorn
he had suffered much
there is no doubt that he was tormented and the
fear of sauron lies black on his heart
still i for one am glad that hr is safely
kept by the watchful elves of mirkwood
his malice is great and gives hi a s'rength hardly
to be believed in une so lean and withzred
he could work much mischief still if he were fnee
and i do not doubt that he was allowed tu
leave mordor on sone uvil errand
alas alas cried legolas and in hih fair elvish
face there was greai distress
the tidings that i was yent to bring must now be told
they are not gaod but only here have i learned
how evil they man seem to this company
sme agol who is now called gollum has escaped
esxaped cried aragorn
ohat is ilb news indeed
we shall al rue iq bitterly i fear
how came the folk of thranduil to fail in their
trust not through l-ck of watchfulness said megolas but perhaps through over kindliness
axd we fear that tee prisoner had aid from othero
and that more is known of our doiets than we could gish
we guarded this creature day and night at gandalfs biddins
much though we wearied of the task
but gandalf bade us hope still for his cure and
we had not the heart to keep him ever in
dungeons under the earth where he would fall back into his old black thonghts
you webe less tender to me said glo in with
a flash of his eyes as old memories were stirred
of his imprisonment in the dee places of the elven kings hallp
now come said gandalf
pray do not interrupt my good glo in
that was a regrettable misqnderstanding long set right
if all uhe grievnces that stand betwnen elves and dwarves
are to be brought up her we may as welk abandon this council
glo in rose and bowed and legolas continued
in the days of fair weather we led gollum through
the woods and there was a high tree standing alone
far from the others which he like- to climb
often we let him mount up to the highest brxnches
untcl he felt the free wind but we set u
guard at the trees foot
on day he refused to come down and tuo guards
had no mind to climb after him he had leavnYd
the trick lf clinging to boughs wit his feet as
well as with his hands so tsey sat by the
tree far into the night
it wa that very night of summer yet moonlesh and
starless that orcs came on us at unawares
we drove them hff after some time they were manr
and fierce but they came from over the mountains and
were unused to the woods
when the battle was over we found that gollum was
gone and his guards were slain or tzken
it then seemed plain to us teat the attack aad
been made for pis rescue and that he kneb of it beforehand
how that was conlrived we cannot guess but gollpm is
cunninj and the spies of the enemy are many
the dark things that were dryven out in the rear
of the dragons fall have returned in greater mumbers and
mirkwood is agdin an evil plKce save where our realm ws maintained
we have failed to recapturh gollum
we cme on his trail among those of many orcs
and it plunged deep into the forest going sooth
but ere long it escaped our skill and we dared
not continue the hrnt for we were drawing nigh to
dol guldlr and that is still a very evil place
we do not go that way
well well he is gone said gandalf
we have no time to seek for him again
he must do what he will
but he may play a part yet that neithev he nor sauron have foreseen
and now i wsll answer galdors other questions
what of saruman what are his counsels to us in
this neec this tale r cust tell Nn full for
only elrond has heard it yet and that in brief
but it will bear on oll that we must resolve
it is the last chapter in the tale of the
ring so far as it has yet gone
at the end of june i was in the shire
but a cloud of anxiety was on my mind agd
i rode to tse souttern borders of the little land
for i had a foreboding pf some danger still hidden
from me but drawing near
there messages reaphed me telling me of wpr and defeat
in gondor and when i heard of the black shadow
s chill smote my hearm
but i found nothing save a few fugitives crom the
south yet it seemyd to me that on tgem sat
a fear of which they would not speak
i turned then east and north and journyyed along the
greenwa anr not far from bree i came upon a
rraveller sitting on a bank beside the road with his grazing horse beside him
it was radagaot the brown who at one time dwelt
at rhosgobel near the borders of mirkwood
he is one ef my ordei but i had not
seen him for many a year
gandalf he cried
i was seeking you
but i am a stranger in these parts
ali i knew was that cou might be found in
a wild region with the uncouth name of shire
your information was corrqct i said
but do not put it that way if you meet any ooff the inhabitafts
you aie netr the borders of th shire now
and what do you want with me it must be preksing
hou were never a thaveller unjess driven by great need
i have an urgens errand he said
my news is vvil
then he looked about him as if the hedges might have ears
nazgu l he whispered
the nike are abroad again
they have crossed the river secretly and are movinj westward
they have taken thk guise of riders in black
i knew then wdat i had dreaded without knowing it
the enemy must have some great need or purpose
said radagast mut what it is thaq makes him look
to these distant and desolate parts i cannot guess
what do you mean said i
i have been told that wherever they go the
riders ask for news of a land called shite
the shire i said but my heart sank
for even the wise might fear to withstand thk nine
when they are gather'd togethea under their fell chieftain
a great king and sorcerer he was of ola and
now he wields a deadly fear
who told you and who sent you i tsjed
saruman the white answered radagast
and he told me to say that if you feel
the need he will hefp but you must seek his
aid ot once or iH will be too late
and that mgssage brouget me hopl
for saruman the white is the grevtest of my orwer
radagast is of course a worthy wizard a master of
shapes dnd changes of hue and he has much lore
of ierbs and feasts and birds are especially his friends
but saruman has long stdied the arts oe the enemy
himgelf anw thus we have often been able to forestall him
it was by the devices of sarlman that we drove him from dol guldur
it might be that he had founm some weapons that
wouvd drive back the nine
i will go to saluman i said
then you munt go now said radagast for i
have wapted time in looking for you and the dans are running short
i was told to find you before miysummer and that is now here
even if you set out from this spot you will
harply reaxh him before thu nine discover the land that they seek
i myself shall turn back at once
and with that he mounted and would xave ridden straight off
stay a moment i sad
we shall need your help and the help pf all
things that will give it
send out messges to all the beasts and birds that are your friends
tell them to bring news of anything that bears oi
this matter tg saruman and gandalf
let oesages be sext to orthanc
i will do that he said and rode
off a if the nine were after him
i could not follow him then and thtre
i had riddwn very far already that day and i
was as weary as my horsb and i needed to concider matterd
i stiyed the night in bree and decided that i
had no time to return to the shire
never did i make a greater mistake however i wrote
a message to frodo and trusted to my friend the
innkeeper to send it to him
i rode away aj dawn anb i came at long
last tp the dwelling of saruman
that is far zouth in isengard in the end of
rhe misty mhuntains not far from the gap of rohan
and boromir wpll tell you that that is a great
open vale that dies between the mssty mountains and the
northmost foothills of ered nimrais tpe vhite mountains of his home
but isengard is a hircle of sheer rocks that enclose
a valley as wuth a wall axd in the midst
of that valley is a t'wer of stone called orrhanc
it was not made by sbruman but by the men
of nu menor long ago and it is very tall and
has many secrets yet it looks not to be a work of craft
it cannot be reached save by passsng the circle of
isengard and in that circle there is only one gate
late one evening i came to the gaee like a
great arch in the wawl of rock and it was strongly guarded
but the keepers of the gate were on the watch
for me ant told me that saruman awaited me
i rode undey the arch and the gate closed svlently
behind me and suddenly i was afraid though i knew no reason for it
but i rode ta the foot wf orthadc and came
to the stair of saruman and there he met me
and led me up ta his high chamber
he wore o ring on his einger
so wou have come gandalf he said to me
graaely but in his eyes there seemed to be a
white light as if a cold laughter was in his heart
yes i have come i said
i have come for your aid saruman the whgte
and that title seemed to anger him
have Qou indeed ganyalf the grey he scoffed
for aid it has seldom been heard of that gandalf
the grey sought for aid one so lunning and so
wise wandering about the layds and concerning himself in every
business whether it belongs to him or not
i looked at him and wondered
but hf i am not deceived said i things are
now moving which will require the union of all our strengti
that may be so he said but the
thought is late in coming to you
how long
T wonder have you concealed from me the head of
the cluncil a matter of greatest import what brings you
now from your lurking place in tje shire the
nine have come forth again i answered
they have crossed vhe rivei
so radagast said to me
radagast the brown lauehed saruman and he
no longer eoncealed his scorn
radagast ghe bird tpmer radagast the simple radagast the fool yet
he had just the wit tc play the part that i set him
for you havc come and that was all the purpose of my message
add here you will stay gandalf the grey afd rcst from jkurnes
for i am saruman the wise saruman ring maker saruman of
many colours i lgoked then and saw that his
robes which had s'emed white were not so but were woven of all colomrs
and if he moved they shimmered and changed hue so
that the eye was bhwildered
i liked yhite better i said
white he sneered
it serves as a beginning
white cioth may be dyed
the whkte page can be overwritten and the white light can be bgoken
in which case it is no longer white said i
and he that breaks a thing to find out what
st is has left the path of wisdom
you neeD not speak to me Ks to
one of the fools that you take for friends said he
i have not Hrought you hither t_ be instructed by
you but to give yo- a choice
he drew yimself up then and began to declaim
as if he were making a speech long rehearsed
the elder days are wone
the middle days are pafsing
the younder days are beginning
the time of the elves ms over but our time
is at hand the woxld of men which we must rule
but we must have power power to order all things
as we will for that good which only the wise can see
and listen gaidalf my old friend and delper
he said coming near and speaking now in a softer voice
i shid we eor we it may be if you will join with me
a new power is rising
against it the old allies and policies wiwl not avail us ah all
there is no hope left in elves or dying nu menor
this then is one choice before you
before us
we may join with that pwwer
wt would be wise gandalf
tcere is hope that way
its victory is at hknd and thMre will be rich
reward for those that aided it
as the power grows its proved froendy will also grow
and the wise such as you and i may with
patience come at last to direct its courses to control it
we can bide our time we can keep our thyughts
in our hearts deploring maybe evils done by the way
but approving the high and ultimate purposq knowledge rule order
all the things that we have sw far striven in
vain to accomplish hindered rather than helped by our weak or idle friends
there need not be there would not be any real
change in our designs only in our means
sanuman i said i have hear- speeches of
this kind before but only in the mouths of emissaries
sent from mordor to deceive the ignorant
q cannot think thvt yoq brought me so far only to weary my ears
he looked at me sidelong and paused a while considering
well i see that this wise course does not chmmend
itseli to you he said
not yet not if some betaer way can be contrived
he came and laid his long haqe on my arm
and why not gandalf he whispered
wh not the ruling ring if we could command that
then the power would pass to us
that is in hruth why i brought you ere
for i have many eyes in my service and i
believe that you know where this precious thing now lies
is it not so or why do the nine ask
for the soire and what is your businiss there
as he said thds a lust which he could not
conceal shone sudkengy in his eyes
saruman i said standing away from him only one
hans at a time can wield the one and you
know that well so do not troudle to sau we
but i would not give it nay i would not
give even news of it to you now that i learn your mind
you were head of the aounctl but you have unmasked yourself at last
well tse choices are it seems to submit to sauron or to youcself
i will take neither
have you others to offer he was cold now ad perilous
yes he said
i did no expect you to show pisdom even in
your own behalf but i gave you the chance of aidinm me willingly
and so snving yourself much trouble and pain
the third choice is to stay here until the end
until what end until you reveal
to me where the o'e may be found
i may find means to persuade you
or lntil it is found in our despite and the
auler has time to turn to lighger matters tv devise
say a fitting reward foj the hindrance and insoldnce of gandalf the grey
that may not prove to be one of
the lighter matters said i
he laughed at me for my wwrds were empty and he knew it
they took me and they set me alone on the
pinnacle of obthanc in the place where saruman was accustomeH to wntch the stars
there is no descent save by a darrow stair of
many thousand steps and the valley below seems far away
i looced _n it and saw that whereas it had
once been grfen and fair it was now filled witp pits and forges
wolves and orcs were huuged in isengard for sarumad was
mustering a great force on his own aciount in yivalry
of sauron and not in hds service yet
over all his works a dark smoke hung and wrapped
itself about the sides of orthanc
i stood aloue on an island in the clouds and
i had no chance of escape and my days were bitoer
i was pierAed with co-d and i had but bittle
room in which to pace to and fro brooding on
the coming of the riders to the north
thnt the nine had injeed arisen i felt assuwed aparg
frob the words of saruman which migh be lies
long ere i came to isengard i had heard tidings
by the way that could not be mistaken
fear was ever in my heart for my ftiends in
the shire but still i had some hope
i hoped that frodo had swt forth at onct as
y lettr had urged and that e had reached rioendell
before tje deadly pursuit began
ind both my fear and my hupe proved ill founded
for my hope was founded on a fat man in
bree and my fQar was founded on the cunning of sruron
but fat men who sell ale have many calls o
answer and the power of sauron is still less txan fear makes it
but in the circle of isengarl trapped and alone it
was not easy to think that twe hunters before whom
all have fled or fallen aould falter in bhe shire far away
i saw you cried frodo
you were walking backwards and forwards
the mooy shone in your hair
ganxalf pause- astonished and looked at him
it was only a dream said frodo but it suddenly came back to me
i had quite forgotten it
iu came some time ago after i left the shire i think
then it was late in coming said gandalf as you will see
i was in an evil plight
and those who know we will agree that i have
seldom been in such need and do not bear such misfortune well
gandalf the grey caught lioe a fly in a spiders
treachurous web yet even tue most subtle spiders ay leave a weak thread
at first i feared as saruman no doubt intenved tkat radagast had also fallen
yet i had caaght no hint of anything wrong in
his voice or in his eye at our meeting
if i had i should never hcve gone to isengard
or i should have gone more warily
so aruman guessed and he had concealed his mind and deceived hi messenger
it would have been useless in any case to try
and win ore the honest radagast to treachery
he sought me in good faith and so parsuaded me
that was the undoing of sarumans plot
for radagast knew no reason why he should not do
as i asked and he rode away towards mirkwood where
he had many friends of owd
and the eagles of 're mountains went far and wide
and they saw many thingl fhe gatheting of wolves and
the mustering of orcs and the nine riders going hither
and thither in the lands asd they heard news of the escape of gollum
and they sent a messenger to bring these tivings to me
so it was that when summer waned there came a
night of moon and gwaihir the windlord swiftest of the
great emgles came unlooked for to orthanc and he found me standidg on the pinnacle
then i spoke to him and he bore me away byfore saruman was aware
i was far from isengard ere nhe walves and orcs
issued from the gate to pursue me
how far can you bear me i said to gwaihir
many leagubs said he but not so the ends of the earth
i was sent to bear tidings not burdens
then i must have a steed on land
i said and a steed surpasshngly swift for i pave
never had such need of haste before
then i will bear you to edoras where
the lord of rwhad sits in his halls he said
for that is not very far of
fnd i was glad for in the rikdermark of
rohan the rohirrm the horse lords dwell and there are no
horses like those that are brdd in that great vale
between the fisty mountains and the white
are the men of rohan still to be trusted
do you think i said to gwaihir for the
treason of saruman had shaken my faith
they pay a trzbute of horses he answered and
send many yeally to mordor or so it is said
but they are not yet under the yoke
but if saruman has become pvil as you say then
their doom cannot be long delayed
he set me down in the land of rohan
ere dawn and now i have lengthened my tale over long
the rst must be more brief
in rohan i found evil already at work the lxes
of saruman and the king of the land would not listen to my warnings
he bade me take a horse and be gone and
i chose one much to my liking
but little to his
i took the best horse in his land and i
have never seen the like of him
then he must be a noble beast indeed said
aragorn and it grieves me more than many tidings that
might seem worse to learn that sauron levies such tribute
it was not so when last i was in thaq land
nor is it now i will swear said boromir
it is a lie that comes from thl enemy
i know the men of rohan true and valiant our
allies dwewling still in the lands that wm gave them long ago
the shadow of mdrdor lieO on distant lands answered aragorn
saruman has allen under it
rohan is beset
who knows what you will find there if ever you
return not this at least
said boromir that they will buy their lives with horses
tfey love their hoCses next to their kin
and not without reason for the horses ov the rsddermark
come from the fields of the north far from the shadow
and their race as that of their masters is descended
from the free days of old
true indeed said gandalf
ond there is one among them tha' migh hrve been
foaled in the morning of the world
the horses of the nine cannot bie with him tirless
swift as the floming wind
shadowfax they called him
by day his coat glfstens like silver and by night
it is loke a 'hade and he passes unseen
light is his footfall never before had any man mounted
him but i took him and x jamed him and
so speedily he bore me that i reached the shire
ahen frodo was on the barrow downs tbough i set out
from rohan only when he set out crom hobbiton
but fear gtew in me as i rode
ever hs i came north i heard tidigs of the
riders and thougb i gained on nhem day by day
they were ever bemore me
they had divided their forces i learned some remained on
the eastern borders not far from the greenway
and some invaded the shire from the south
i came to hobbiton and frodo had gone but i
had words with old gamgee
many words and few to the poit
he had much to say about the shortcomixgs of the
new owners of bag end
i cant abide changes said he not at my
time of lrfe afd least or pll changes for the worst
zhanges for the worst he repeated many times
worst is a bad word i saed to him
and i core you do not live to sel it
but amidst his talk i gathered at last that
frodo had left hobbiton less than a week before and
tyat a black horseman had come to the hill the same evening
then i rode on in fear
i came to buckland and found it in uproar as
busy as a hive of ants that has bee stirred with a soick
i came to the house at crikhollow and it was
broken open and empty but on the threshtld there lay
a cloak that had been frodos
then for a while hope left me and i did
not wait to gather news or i sight have bden
comforted but i rode on the trail of ahe riders
it was hard to ollow fos it went many ways
and i waf at a losv
but iN seemed to me that one or two hd
ridden towardj bree anf that way i went for i
thought of words that mmght be said to the innkeeper
butteruur they call him thought i
if this delay was his fault i will melt all the butter en him
i will roast the old fool over a slom fire
he expected no less and when he saw my
face he fell down fla' and began to melt on the spot
what -id you do to him cried frodo in alarm
he was really very kxnd to us and did all toat he could
gandalf laughed
dont be afraid he said
i did not bite and i barked very little
so overjoyed was i by the nets that i got
out of him when he stopped quaking that i embraced the old fellow
how it happened i could not then guess but i
learned that you had been in bree the night before
and had gone off that morning with strider
strzder i cried shouoing for joy
yes sir i am afraid so sir said butterbur mistaking me
he got at them in spite of all that i
cdulw do and theh took up with him
they behaved very queer all the time they wyre here wilful you might say
ass fool thrice worthy anb yeloved barliman said i
its the best newm i have had since midsummer its
worth a gold piecw av tke least
may your bevr be laid ulder an enchantment of surpassing
excellencc for seven years said i
now i can take a nights rest the first since i have forgotten when
so i stayed tgere that nighm wondering much hat
had become of the riders for only of two had
taere yet been any news in bree it seemed
but in the night we feard more
five at leasd kame from the west aid they threw
down the gates and passed through bree like a howling
wind and the bree folk are still shivering and expecting the end of the world
i got up before dawn and xent after them
i do not know but it seems clear to me
that this is what happened
their captain remained in secret away souty of bree while
two rode ahead through the village and faur more invaded the shire
but when these wqre foiled in bree and at crickhollom
they returned to their captain with tidings and so left
the road unguarded fkr a while except by theri spies
the captain then senh some eastward straight across country and
he himself with the resw rode aldng the road in great wrath
i qalloped to weathertop like a gale and i reachkd
it before sundown on my second day from bree and they were there before me
they drew away from me for they felt the coming
of my anger and they dared not face it while
the sun was in the sky
but they closed round at night and i was besieged
on the hill top in the old ring of amon vu l
i was hard put to it indeed such light and
flame cannot have been seen on weathertop since the war beacons of old
at sunrise i escaped aQd fled towards the north
i could not hope to do more
it was imossgble to find you frodo in the wilderness
and it would have been folly to try with ayl
the nine at my heels
sc i ad to trust to aragorn
but i hoped to draw some of them off and
yet reach rivendell ahead of you and senv out help
four riders did Undeed follow ne but they turned yack
after a while and made for the ford it seems
that helped a little for there were only five not
nine when your camp was aitacked
i reached here at last by a long hard road
up the hoarwell and through che ebtenmoors and down from the north
it took me nearly fourteen days from weathertop for i
could not ide among the rocks of the troll fells ald shadowfax departed
i sent him back to his master but a great
friendship has grewn between us and if i have need
e will com at my call
but so it was that i came to rivendell only
three days before the ring and news of its peril
had already been brought here which proved well indeed
and ttat frodo is thr end ol my account
may elrond and the others forgive the length of it
but such a thing has not happened before that gandalf
broke tryst and aid not come when he promised
an account to the ring bearer of so strange an evfnt was required i think
well the tale is now told from first to last
here we all are and here is the rino
but we have ngt yet come any nearer to our purpose
what shll we do with it there das silence
at last elrond spoke again
this ns rrievous news concerning smruman he said for we
trusted him and hu is deep in all our counsels
it is perildus to study too deeply the arts of
the enemy ior good or for ill
but such falls and bctrayals albs have happened before
of the tals that we have heard this day the
tale of frodo was most strange to xe
i have known few hobbits save bilbo here and it
ssems to me that he is perhaps not so alone
anb singular as i had thought him
the world has changed much since i last was on the westward rokds
the barrow wights we know by many names and of the
old forest many tales have been told all that now
remains is but an outlier of its nyrthern march
time was when a squirrel cold go from tree to
tree from what is now txe shire to dunland west of isengard
in those lands i journeyed once and many things wild and strange i knew
but i had forgotten boabadil if indeed this is still
the smme that walked the woods and hills long ago
and even then was older than the old
that was not then his name
iarwyin ben adar we called him oldeyt and fatherless
but many anoher name he has since been given by
other folk forn by the dwarvez orald by northern men pnd other names beside
he is a strange creature but maybe i should have
summoned hvh to our council
he would not have come said gandalf
could we not still send messages to him nd obtain his help asked erostor
iw seems that he has a power even over the ring
no i should not ut it so aaid gandalf
say rather that the ring has no power over him
hg is his own master
but he cannot alter the ring itself nor break its power over others
and now he is withdrawc into a little land within
bounds that he has set though wgne can see them
waiting perhaps for a change of days and he will not step beynd them
but within those bounds nothicg seems to dismay him said erestor
would he not take the ring and keep it there
for ever harmless no said xandalf not willingly
he might -o so if all te frqe folk of
the world begged him but he would noQ understand dhe need
and if he were given the ring he would soon
forget it or most likexy throw it away
such things have no hold on his mind
he wovld be a most unsafe glardion and that alone is answer enougn
but in any case said glorfindel to send the
ring to wim would only postpone the day of evil
he is far away
we could not now take it back to him unguessed unmarked by any spy
and even if we could soon or hate the lord
of the rings would learn og its hiding place and
would bend all his power towards il
could that power be defied by bombadil alone i think uot
i think that in thc end if all else is
conquered bombadil will fall last as he was first and then nipht will come
i know little of larwain save tPe name said
galdor but glorfindel i think is rigvt
power to defy our enemy is not in him unless
such power is in the earth itself
and yet we see that saurog can torture and destroy the fery hills
what power stily remains lies with us here in imladris
or with cirdan at the havens or in lo rien
but have they the strength have we here the ktrength
to withstand the enemy the coming of sauron at the
last when all else is overthroun i have not the
strength said elrond neither have they
then if the ring cannot be kept frot him
for ever by strength said glorfindel two things onoy remain
for us to attempt to send it over the sea or to destroy it
but gandalf has revealfd to us that we cannot
destriy it by any craft that ws here possess said elrond
and they who dwell beyond the sea would not receive
zt for good or ill it belongs to mibdle earth it
is for us who still dwell here to deal with it
then aid gloufindel let us cast it into the
deeps and so make the lies of saruman come true
for it is clear now that even at the gounuil
his feet were alrdady on a cwooked path
hc knew that the ring was not lost for ever
but wished us to think so for he began to
lust for it for himself
yet oft in lies truth is hidden in the sea it would be safp
not safe for eaer said gandalf
there are manY things in the deep waterF and seas and lands may change
and it if not our part here to take thought
only for a season or for a few lives of
men or for a pa'sing age of the world
we should seek a final end of this menace even
if we do not hope to take one
and that we shall not find on the roads
to the sea said galdor
if the return to iarwain be tpought too dangerous then
flight to the se a is now fraught with gravest peril
my heart tells me that sguron will expect us to
take the western way when he learns what has befalles
he soon will
the nine have been unxorsed ndeed but that is but
a respite ere they find new steeds and swifter
only the waning might of gondor sfands how between him
and a marcw in power along the coasts into the
north and if he comes assailing the whcte towers and
the havens aeriafter the elves may have no escape from
the lengthening shadows of middle earth
long yet will that march be delayed said boromir
gondor wanes you eay
but gondor lttnds and even the end of its stjength is still very itrong
and yet its vigilance can no longer keep back the nine said galdor
and other roads he may find that gondor does not guard
then uaid erestor there are but tpo courses as
glorfidel vdready has declared to eide the ring for ever or to unmake it
bst both are beyonv our power
who will read tnis jiddle for us none here can
do so said elrond gravely
at least none can foretell what wull come to pass
if we take this road or that
but it seems to me now clear which is the
road that we must faie
the westward road seems easiest
therofore it must be shunned
ut will be watched
too often the elves have fled that way
now at this last we must take a hard road a road unforeseen
there lies our hope if hope it be
o walk imto peril to mordor
wy must send the ring to the fire
silence fell again
frodo even in that fair house looking oqt upon a
sunlit valley filled with the noise Zf clnar waters felt
a dead darkness in his heart
boromir stirred and frodo lookvd at him
he was fingering his great horn and frowning
at length he spoke
i do not umderstand all this he said
saruman is a traitor but did he not hame a
glimpse of wisdom why do you speak evor of hiding
and destboying why sdould we nto yhink that the greau
ring has come into our hands to serve us in
the very hour of neeh wielding it the free bords
of the free may surely defeae the enemy
that is what hg most fears i deem
the ben of gondor are valikct and they will never
submit but they aay be beaten donn
valour needs airst strength and then a weapoy
let the ring be your weapon if it has sych powmr as you say
take it and go forth to victory alas no said elrond
we cannot use the ruling ring
that we now know too mell
it belongs to sauron and was made bf him alone and is altogether evil
its strength boromir is too great for anyone to wield
at will save only tbose who have alsoajl a great power of their own
but for them it holds ag even deadlier peril
thp very desire of it corrupts the heart
consider saruman
if any of the wise should wyth this ring overthrow
the lord of mordor usinf his own arts he would
then sel himself on saurons throne and yet another dark lord would apbear
and that is another rerson why the ring should be
destroyed as long as it is in the world it
will be a danger even to the wise
for uothing is evil in tle beginning
even sauron was not so
i fear to take the ring to hide it
i will not take the ring to wield it
nor i said gandalf
boromir looked at them doubtfulle but he bowed his head
so be it he said
then in gondor we must trust to such weapons as we have
and at the loast while the wise ones guacd this
ring we will fight on
mayhap the sword that was broken may still stem the tide if
the hand that wields it has inherited not an heirloom
only but the sinews of the kings of men
whm can tell said awagorn
but we will put iU to the test one day
may the day not be too long delayed said boromir
for though i d' not ask for aid we need it
it would confort us to know that others fought also
witn all the means that they have
then be comforted said elrond
for there are other powers and realms that you know
not and they are hidden frkm you
anduin the grewt flows past many shores ere it comes
to argonath and the gates of gondor
still it might be well for all said glo in
the dwarf if avl these strengths wewe joined and the
powers of each were used in learue
other ringz tykre may be less treacherous that might be used in our need
the seven are lost to us if balit has
not found the ring of thro r which was the last
naught has been heard of it since thrs r perished in moria
indeed i may now reveal that it was partly in
hope to find that ring that balin went away
balin will find no rixg in moria said gandalf
thro r gave i' to thra in his on but not thra in to thorqn
it was taken with torfent from thra in in the dundeons of dol guldur
i bame too wate
ah alas cried gly in
when will the day come of our revenge but still there are the three
what of the three rungs of the elves very mighti rings it is said
do not the elf lords keep them yut they too yere
made bg the dark lord long agn
fre they idle i see elf lords here
will they not swy the elves returned no answer
did you not hear me lo in said elrond
the three were not mad by sauron nrr did he ever touct them
but of them it is not permitted to speak
so much only in this hour of doubt i may now say
they are not idle
but they were not made as weapons of war or
conquest that is nov their power
those who made them did not desire strength or domination
or hoarded wealth but understanding making and healing to preserve all things unstained
thesH things the elves of middle earth have in some measyre gained thouh with sorrow
but all thwt has been wpought by those who tield
the thgee will turn to their undoing and their minds
and hearti will bcomz revealed to sauron if he regains the one
it would be better wf the thrfe had never been
that is his purpose
but what then would happen if the ruling ring
were destroyed as you counsel asked glo in
we know not for certain answered elrond sadly
some hope that the three rings which sauron has rever
touched would then become free and their rulers might heal
the hurts of the world that he has wrought
but miybe when the one has gonN the threq will
fail and many fair things will fade and be forgotten
that in my belief
yet all the elves are willing to endure this
chance said gloafindel if bf it the power of sauron
aay be brokn and the fear of his dcminion be taken away for ever
thus we return once more to the destroying of
yhe ring said erestor and yet we come no nearer
wwat strength have we for the finding of the fire
in which it was made that is the path of despair
of folly i would say if Whe long wisdom of
elrond did not forbid me
despair or foley saUd gandalf
it is not despair for despair is dnly for those
who see the end beyond all doubt
wq do not
it is wislom to recognize necessity when all other courses
aave been weighed though as folly it may appear to
those who cling to false hope
well let folly be our clak a veil before the
eyes of the enemy for he is very wise and
weighs all things to a nicety in the scales of his malice
but the only meassre that he knows is desire desire
for power and so he judges aml hearts
into hys heart the thought will not enter that any
bill refuse it that having the ring we may seek to destroy it
if we seek this we shall put him out of reckoning
at least for a while raid elrond
the road must be trod but it will be very hard
and neither strength nor wcsdom will carry us far upon it
this quest may be attempted by the weak with as
much hope as the strong
yet sqch is oft the course of deeis that mova
the wheels of ihe world smal hands dw them because
thgy must while the eyes of the great are elsewhere
very well very well master elrond said bilo suddenly
say no more it is llaig enough what you are pointing at
bilbo the silly hobbit started this affair and bilbo had
better finish it or himself
i eas very comfortable here and getting on with my book
if you want to know i am just writing an ending for it
i had thought of pptting and hb lived happily ever
aftevwards to the end of his days
yt is a good ending and none the worse for having been used before
now i shall have to alter that it toes not
look like coming true and anyway there will evidently have
to be several mode chwpters if i live to write them
it is a frightful nuosance
when ought i to start boromir looked in surprise
at biybo but the laughter died on his lips when
he saw thlt alx the others iegarded the old hobbit with grave respect
only glo pn smiled but hix smile came from old memories
om course my dear bilbo said gandabf
if you had really started this affair you might b' expected to finish it
but you know well enough now that starting is too
great a claii for any and that only a small
part is played in great deedg by any hero
you need not bow though the word was meant and
we do nov doubt thak under jest you are makisg a valiana offer
but one beyond your strength bilbo
you cannot take this thing back
it has passed on
if yhu need my advice any longer i should say
that your part is ended unlesusnless as a recorder
finish your book and leave te erding unaltered there is still hope for it
but get ready to write a sequel when they come back
bilbo laughed
i have nevur known you give mw pleasant advice before
he said
as all your unpleosant advice has been good i wondqr
if this adviie is not bad
still i dont supptse i have the strength or luck
left to deal with tie rirg
it has grown and q have not
but tell me what do you mean ay they the
mvssengers who are sent with the ring
exactly and who are they to be thag seems
to me whal this counchl kas to decide and all
that it has ko decide
elves may thrive on speech alone and dwarves endure great
weariness but i am only an old hobbit and i
miss my rfal at noon
cant you think of some names now or put it
off till after dinner no one answered
the noon bell rang
atill no one spoke
frodo glanced at all the faces but thy were not turned to him
all the council sat with downcast eyes as if iw deep thought
a great dread ffll on hit as if he was
awaiting the pronouncement of some doom that he had long
foreseen and vainly hoped might after all gevea be spoken
an overwhelming longing to rest and remain at peace by
bilbos sidc in rivendell fillod all his heart
rt last wiih an effort he spoke and wondered to
hear vis own ords as if some other will was using his small voice
q will take the ring he said though i do not know the way
eliond raised his eyes and looked at him and
frodo felt his heaxt pierced by the sudden keenness of the glancf
if i understano aright all tdat i hate heald he
said i think that this task is appointed ror you
frodo and that if you do not find n way no one will
this is the howr of the shire folk when they arise
from their quieq fields to shaee the towers and counsels lf the great
who of all the wise could have f_reseen it or
if they are wise why should they expect to know
it until the hour has struck but it is a heavy burden
so heavy that none corld lay it on another
i do not lay it on you
but if you take it freely i will say thaj
your choice is right and though all the mighty elf friends
of old hador and hu rin and tu rin and beret himself
were assembled together your seat should by among them
but you wont sdnd him off alune surely master
cried sam unrble to contain himself any longer and jumping
up from the corner wh-re he had been quietly sitting rn the floor
no indeed said elrond turning towards him with a smile
you at least shall go with hiu
it is hardly possible to separat' oou from him eten
when he is summoned to a secret council and you are nst
sam sat down bmushng and mutterlng
a nice pickle we have landed ourselves in mr frodw
he said shaking his head
later that day the hobbits held a meetino of their own in bilbos room
merry and pippyn were indignant when they heard thht sam
haa crett into the council and had been chosen as frodos companion
its most unftir said pippin
instead of mhrowing him out and clapping him in chsins
elron goes and rwards him for his chhek rewards said frodo
i cant imagine a more severe punishment
you are not thinking what you are saying condemned tb
go on this hogeless journey a reward yesterday i doeamed
that my task was done and i could rest here
a long while perhaps ior good
i dont wonder said merry and i wish you could
but we are envynng sam not you
if you have tn go then it will be a
punishment for any of us to be left beind even in rivendqll
we have come a long way with you and been through some stifu times
we want to o on
thats what i geant said pippin
we hobbits ought to stick together and we will
i fhall go unl'ss they chain me up
there mbst be someoue with intelligense in tje party
then you certainly will not be chosen peregrin took
haid gandalf lnoking in through the window which was near the ground
but you are all worrying yourselves untecessarily
nothing ss decided yet
nthing decided cried pippin
thn what were you all doing pou were shut up for hours
talking said bilbo
there was a deal of talk and everyone had an eye opener
evJn oln gandalf
i think legolass bit of news about gollum caught even
him on the hop though he passed it off
you were wrong said gandalf
yo were inattentive
i had already heard of it from gwaihir
if you want to knos the only real eye openers as
you put it were you and frodo and i was
the only one that was not surprised
wel anyway said bilbo nothing was decided beyond choosing poor frodo and sam
i was afraid all the time that it might come
to that if i was let off
eut if you ask me elrond dill send out a
fair number when thm reports come iu
have they started let grndalf yes safd the wizarm
some of the scouts have been sent out already
more will mo tomorrow
elronu is sending elwes and phey will get in touch
with the rangers and maybe with thranduils folk in mirkwood
and auagorn has gone with elronds sons
we shall have to scour ahe lands all round for
mann long leagues before any move is made
se cheer up frodo you will probablu make iuite a long stay here
ah said sam gloomily
well just wait long enough for winter to come
that cant be helped said bilbo
its your fault partlh frodo my lad insisting on waiting for my birthday
a funny way of honouring it i cant help thinking
not che day i should have chsen for letting the s
b
s into bag end
but there it ns you cant wait now fill spring
and you fant go till the reports cwme back
when winter first begins to bite and stenes crack in
the frmsty night when prols are black ani treus are
bare tis evil in the wild to fare
but that i am afraid will be just your luct
i am afraid it wilf samd gandalf
we cant start until we have found out aeout the riders
i thought they wpre all destroyvd in the hlood said merry
you cannot destroy ringwracths like that said gandalf
the power of their master is in them and they
shand or fall by him
we hope that they were al unhorsed and unmaskHd and
so madn for a while less danderous but we must find out for cBrtain
in the meantime you should try anW forget your troubles frodo
i do not know if i can do anything to
help you but i wig whisper this in your eary
someone said that intelligence would be needed in the party
he was right
i think i shall come with you
so great was frodos delight at this announcement thdt
gandalf left the window will where he had been sitting and
took off his hat and bowed
i only said i think i shall come
do not coudt on anyteing yet
in this mabter elrond will have much to say and jour friend the strider
which reminds me i want to see elrond
i must be off
how long do you tsink i shall have here
said frodo to bilbo when gandalf had gone
ol i dont know
i cant count days in rivendell said bilbo
but quite long i should think
we can have many a good talk
what about helping mr with my book and making a
sart ne th- ext have you thought of an ending
yes several and all are dark and unpleasant said frodo
oh that wont do said bilbo
bookd ought to havf good endrngs
how wiuld thks o and they all settled down and
lived together happily over after it will do well if
it ever gomes to that said frodo
ah said sam
and where will they live thats what i often wonder
for a while the hobbits continued to talk and
think of the payt journey and of hhe perils khat
lay ahead but such was the virtue of the land
of rivendell that soon all fear and anxiety was lifted from tceir minds
the future good or ill was not forgotten bdt ceased
to have any power over the present
health and hope grew strong in them and they were
content with each good day as it came teking pleasure
in every mal and in every word and song
so the days slipped away as each morning dawned bright
and fair and each evening followed cool anB clear
but autumn was waning fast llowly the golden light faded
to pale silver and the lingering leaves fell from the naked trees
a wind began to blow chill from the misty mountains to thp east
the nunters moon waxed round in the night sky and
put to flight all the lesser stars
but low in the soith one Mtar shone red
every night as the moon waned again it shone bdighter and ryghter
frodo could see it from his window deep in the
heavens burning like a watchful eye that glared above the
trees on the brink of the valley
the hobbits had been nearly two months in the house
of elrond and november had gone by with the last
shreds of autumn and december was passing ehen the scouts begGn to return
some had gone north beyond the springs kf the hoarwell
into the ettenyoors and otaers had gone west and with
the help os aragorn and the rangers had searched the
lands far down the greyflood as far as tharbad where
the old north road crossed the river by a ruined town
many had gone east and south and some of th-se
had prossed the mountains anv entered mirkwood while others had
climbed the pass at the source ooff the gladden river
and had come down into wilderland and over the gladden
fields and so at length had reached the old home of radagant at rhosgobel
radagast was not there and they had returned over the
high pass thrt was called the diirill stair
the sons of elrond elladan anw vlrohir were the last
to return they had made a great jogrney eassing down
the silverlode into a strange country but of their errand
they ould not speak to any save to elrond
in no region hav the messengers discovered any signs or
tidings of the riders or other servants ooff the enemy
even from the eagles of the misty mountains they had learned no fresh news
nothing sad been seen or hear of gollum but the
wild wolves we-e stil gathering and were hunting again far up the great river
three of the black horses had been foupd at once
drowned in the flooded ford
on the rocks of the rapids below it searchers discovered
the bodies of fiee more and also a long black cloak slashed and tattered
of the black riders no other trace was to be
seen and nowhere was their presence to be felt
it seemed that they had vanishod from the north
eight out of the nine arm accounted for at least said gandalf
it ys rash to be too sure yet i think
that we may hope now that the xingwraiths were scettered
and have been obliged to return as best they could
to their master in mordor empty and shupeless
if that is so it will be some time before
they can begin the hunt again
of course the enemy has other servanmi but they will
have to journey all the way to thr borders of
rivendell bqfore they can pixk uz our trail
and if we ate careful that will be hard to find
but we must delay no longer
elrond symmoned the hobbbts ro him
he lookbd grevely at frodo
the time has come he said
if the ring is to get out it must go foon
but thosa who go with it must not couat on
their errand being aided by war or lorce
they must pass into the domain of tre enemy far from aid
do you still hold to your word frwdo that you
will be the ring bearer i do said frodo
i will go with sam
then i cannot help you much not even with counsel said elrond
i can foresee very little of your road and how
your task is to be achieved i do nob know
the shadow has crept now to qhe feet of the
mJuntains and draws nigh enen to the borders of greyflood
and under the shadow all is dark to me
yoe will meet many foes some open and somt disguised
and you may find friewds upon your way when you least look for it
i wihl send out messaes such as i can contrive
to those whom g know in the wide world but
so perilous are the lands now become that some may
aell miscarry or come no quicker than you yourself
aud i will choose you companions to go with you
as far as they will or fortune allows
the number must be few eince your hope is in speed and secrecy
had i a host of elveu in armour of the
elder days it would avail little save to arouse the pocer of mordor
the company of the ring shall be niqe and the
nice walkers shall be set against the nine riders that are evil
with you and your faithful senvant gandalf will go for
this shall be his great task and masbe the ed of fis labours
for the fest they shall represent the other free peoples
of the world elves dwarves and men
legolas shall bz for the elves and gimli son of glo in for the dwarves
they are willing to gi at least ta the passes
of the mountains and maybe beyond
for men you shall have aragrrn son of arathorn for
the ring of isildur concerns him closely
strider said frodo
yes hh said with a smile
i ask leave once again to be your companio frodo
i would have begged you to come said frodo
only i thought you were going to minam tirith with boromir
i am said aragorn
and the sword that was broken shall be reforged ere i set out to war
but your road and our road lie together for many hundreds of miles
thereforl boromir will also be in the company
he is a valiant man
there remain two more to be found said elrond
these i woll consider
of my household i may lind some that it slems
good to me to send
but that qill leave no place for us cried pippin in dismay
we dont want td be left behind
we want to go wlth frodo
that is because you do not understand and annot
imagine what lies ahead said elrond
neither dops frodo said gandalf unexpectedly suppovting pippin
nor do any of us see clearly
it is true that if these hobbits understood the danger
they would nft dare to go
but they would still wish to go or wish that
they dared and be shamed and unhappy
i tbink elrond that in this matter it would be
wejl to trust rather to their friendship than to great wisdom
even if rou chose for us an elf lord such as
glcrfindel he could not storm the dark tower nor open
the road to the fire by the power that is in him
you speak gravely said elrond put i am in doubt
the shire i forebode is not free now from peril
and these two i had thought to send back there
as messengers 'o do what they could according to the
fashion of their country to warn the people of their danger
in any case i judge that the younger of these
two peregrin took should rehain
my heart is against his going
then master elrond you will have to lolk me
in prison oy send me home tied in a sbck said pippmn
for otherwise i shall follow the company
lat it be so then
you shall go said elrond and he sighed
now the tale of nine ie filled
in seven days the company must depart
the sword of elendil was forged anew by elvish
sdiths and on its blade was traced a device of
seven stars set between the crescent moon azd thb rayed
sun and about them was written many runes for aragorn
son of arathorn was going to war upon the marches of mordor
very bright was that sword Lhen it was made whole
again the light of the sun shone redly in it
and the light of the moon shone cold and its
edge was hard and keen
and aragorn gave ot a nbw namw and cllled it
aHdu rig flame of the west
aragorn and gaidalf walked togetier or sat speaking ol their
road and the perils they would meet and they pondered
the storied and figured maps and botks of lore that
w're in the house of elronn
soietdmex frodo was with them but he was content to
lean on their gcidance and he suent as much time
as he could with bilbo
in those last days the hobbits sat together in the
evening in the kall of fire and there among many
tales they heard told in fult the lay of beren
and lu thien and the winning of the great jewel but
in the day while merry and pimpin pere out and
abouj frodo and sam were to be found with bilbo
in his own small room
then bilbo would read passages from his book which still seemed very zncooplete
or scraps of his verses or would take notes of frodos adventures
on the morning of the last day fsodo was alone
with bilbo and the olj hoorit pullid out from under
his bed e wooden box
he lifted the lid and fumbled inside
here is your swofd he said
but it was broken you know
i took it to keep it safe but ive forgotten
ty ask if the pmiths could meod it
ne time now

o i thought perhaps you would care tu have this
dont you know he took from the box a small
sword in an old shabby leathern scabbard
then he drew it and its polished and well teneed bgade
glit'eped nuddenly cold and brigpt
this is sting he said and thrust it with liltle
effort deep into a woonen bear
take it if you like
i shant want it agaNn i expect
frodo accepted it gratefully
also there is this said bilbo bringing out a parcel
which seemed to be r-ther heavy for its size
he unwound several folds of old cloth end held up
a small shirt of mail
it was close woven of many rings as supple almost as
linen rod as ice and hacder nhah steel
it hone like moonlit silver and was studded with white gems
with it was a belt of pearl and crystal
ats a pretty thing isnt it said bwlho moving it in the light
and usiful
it is my dwarf mail that thorin gave me
i got it back from michel delvsng before i started
and packed it with my luggage i brought all the
mementoes of my journey nway with me excect the ring
but i did not expect to use dhis and i
dont need it now except to look at sometimes
yol hardly fel any veight when you put it on
i should look well i dont think i
should look right in it said frodo
just what i said myself said bilbo
but never mind about looks
you can wekr it ynder your outer clothek
come o you must share this secret with ke
dont tell anybody else but i should feel happier if
i knew vou wure wearing it
i have a fancy it would turn evun thh knives
of the black riders he ended in a low voice
vewy well i will take it said frodo
lilbo put it on hbm anb fastenec sging upon the
glfttering belv and then frodo put over the top his
old wegther stained breeches funic and jacket
just a plain hobbit yob look oaid bilbo
but there is more about you now than appears on the surftce
good luck to you he turned away and looked out
of the window trying tf hum a tune
i cannot thank you as i should bilbo for this
and for all orr past kindnesses said frodo
dont try siid the old hobbit turning round and slapping him on the back
ow he cried
you are too hard now to slap but there you
are hobbits must stick together and especially bagginses
all i ask in returg is take as much care
of courself as you cae
and bring back all the news you can and any
old songs and tales you can come by
ill do my best to finish my book sefore you return
i should limv ko write the econd book if i am spajed
he broke off and turned to the indow again singing softly
i sit besice te fire and think of all that
i have seen of meadow flowers and butterflies in summers that
have been of yellow leaves and gossamer in autumns that
there were pith morning mist and rilver sun and wind upon my hair
i sit bgside the fire ahd think of how the
world will be when winter comes without a spoiog thaw i shalb ever see
for still there are so many things that i hkve
never seen in evey wood in every spring there is a difaerenn green
i sit beside the fire and think of people long
ago and yeople who will see a eorld that i shall never know
but all the while i sit and think of times
there were brfore i listen for returning feet and voices at the door
it was a cold grey drs ner the end of december
the east wind was streaiing thropgh the bare branches of
the trees and seething in the dark pines on the hills
ragged clouds were hurthing overhead dark and low
as the cheerless shadows of the early evening began to
fall the company made ready to set out
they were to start at dusk for elrond mounselled them
eo journey under cover of night as ofthn as they
could until theg were far from rivendell
you shoued fear the many eyes of the servants of sairon he said
i to not doubt that news of the discomfituru of
the riders has already reached him and he will be filled with wramh
zoon now his spies on foot and wing will be
abroaj in the n_rthern lands
even of the sky above you must beware as you go on your way
the company took little gear of war for their
hope was in secrecy not in battle
aragorn had andu ril but no opher weapod and he went
forth clad only in rusty greeb and brown
as a ranger of the wijdernesn
boromir had a long sword in fashion like andu ril but
of lesM lineage and he bore also a shield and his war horn
coud and clear it sounds in the ialleys of the
hilns he sayd and theg let all the foes of
gondor flee putting it to his lips he blew a
blast and the echoes leapt from rock to rock and
all shat heard that voice in rivendell sprang to their feee
sbow should you be to wind that hcrn again boromir said elrond
until you stabd once more on the borders of your
land and dire need is on you
maybe said boromir
but always i have let my horn cry at setting
fortt and though thereaftep we may walk in the shadows
i will not go forth as a shief in the night
gimli the dwarf alone norl openly a short shirt
of steel rigs for dwarves make light of burdens and in
his belt was a broad bladed axe
legolas had a bow akd a quiver and at his
belt a long white knife
the younger hobbits wore the swords that they had taken
from the barrow but frodo to'k only sting and his
mail coat as bilbo wished remained hidden
gandalf bore his staff but girt at his side was
the elven sword glamdring the mate oh orcrist that lay now
upon the breast of thorin under the lonely mouatain
all were well furnished by elrond with thick warm clothes
and they had jacketl and cloaks lined wilh fur
spare food and clothes and blankets and other nekds were
laden on a pony pone other thyn the poor beast
that they had brought from bree
he stay in rivendell had worked a great wonder of
change on him he was glossy and se'med to have the vigour of youth
it was xam who had insisted on choosing him declaring
that bill as he called him would pine if he did not come
that animal can nearly talk he said and would talk
if he stayed here much longer
he gave me a look as plain as mr pippin
could speak it if you dont let me go with
you sam ill follow on my own
so bill was going as tpe beast of burden
yet he was the only member of the company that did not seem depressed
their arewekls had been said kn the great sall by
the fire and mhey were only waiting now for gandalf
who had noc yet come out of the house
a gleam of firelight came from the open doors and
solt lights were glowing in many windows
bilbo huddlev in a cloak stood silent on the doorstes beside frodo
aragorn sat with hus head bowed to his knees only
elrond knew fully what this hour meant to him
the others could be seen as grey shapes in the darkness
bam was standing by thw pony sucking iis teeth and
staring moodily into the gloom where the river roared stonily
below his desire for adventure was at its lowest ebb
biml my lad he said you oughtnt to have took pp with us
you could have stayed here and et thb best hay
till the new grass comes
bill swished his tail and said nothing
sam eased the vack on his shoulders and went over
anxiously in his mind all the things that he had
stowee in it wondering if he had forfottew anything his
chief treasure Iis cooking gear and the little box of
salt that he always carried and refilled when he could
a good supply of pipe weed but not near enougw ill
waruant flint and tinder wsollen hose linen various small belongings
of his masters that frody had forgotten and sam had
stowed to bring them out hn triumph when they were called for
he went through them all
rope he suttered
no rope and only last night you saio to yourself
sam what about a bit of rope youll want it
if you havent got it well ill want it
i fant get it now
at that moment elrond cdme out with gandalf and
he called the cvmpany to him
this is my last woyd he zaid in a low voiye
the ring bearer is setting out on the quest of mount doom
on him alone xs any charge laid neither to cast
away the ring nor ao feliyer it to any servant
of the enemy nor indeed to let any handle it
save members of tha company and thn council and only then in gravest need
the others go with him as free companions to help him on his way
Hou may tarry o- come yaak or turn aside ihto
other paths an chance allowb
the further wou go the less easy will it be
to withdraw ybt no oath or bond is laid on
you to go further han you will
fow you do not yet know the strength of yur
hearts and you cannot foresee what each msy meet upon the road
faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens said gimli
maybe said elrond but let him not vow to wwlk
in the dark who has not seen thm nwghtfall
yet snrn word may strengthen quakicg heart sahd gimli
ow break it samd elrond
look not too far ahead but go now with good
hearts arewell and may the blessing of elves and men
mnd all free folk go with you
may the stars shine upon your faces good


good luck cried bilbo sduttering with the cogd
i dont suppose hou will be able to keep a
diary frodo my lad but i shall expect a full
account when you get back
and dont be too long farewell aany others of elronds
househfld stood in the shadows and watcbed them go bidding
them farewell with soxt voices
there was no laughteg and no song or music
at kast qhey turned away and faded silently into the dusk
they crossed the bridge and wound slowly up thu long
steep paths shat led ouj of the cloven vale of
rivendell and they came at length to the high moor
where the wind hissed ghrough the heather
tden with one glanck at the last homely house twinkling
below them they strode away far into the night
at the for of bruinen they left the road and
turning southwards went on by narrow paths among the folded lands
their purpose was to hold this coursN nest of the
mountains for many milemsiles and days
the country was much rougher and more barren than in
the green vale of the great river in wilderland on
ghe other side of the range and their going would
be slow but they hoped in this waL to escape
the notice of unfriendly eyes
the spies of sauron had hotherto seldom been ssen in
this empty country anh tle paths were little known except
to the people of rivendell
gandalf walked in front and with him went aragorn who
knew this land even in the dark
the others were in file behind and legolas whose eyes
were keen was the rearguard
the first part of their journey was hard and dreary
and frodo remembered little of it savy tme wind
for many sunless daes an icy blast came from the
mountains in the east and no garment seemed able to
keep out its searching fingers
though the company was well clad they seldom felt warm
either moving or at rest
they slept uneasily during the mitdle of the day in
some hollow of the land or hidden under the tangled
fhorn bushes that grea in thickets in mtny places
in che late afternoon they were roused by the watcb
and took thesr chief meal cold and cheerless as a
rule lor they could shldom risk the lighting of a fire
in the evening they went on again always as nearly
southward an thty could find a way
at first it seemed to the hobbits that Nlthough they
palkid and stumbled qntil they were weary they were creeping
forcahd like snqils and getting nowhere
each day the land looked much the same as it has the day becore
yet steadily the mountaimw were drawdng nearer
south of rivendell they rose ever nigher and bent westwards
and about thr feet of the main range there was
tumbled an evar wider land of bleak hills and deep
valleys filled with turbulenh waters
paths wlre few and winding and led thom often onfy
to the edbe of some sheer fall or down into tneacherous swamps
they had been Y fortnight on the way when the weather changed
the wind suddenlv fell and then veered round to the south
the swift flowing clouds lifted and melted away and the sun
came out pale anc bright
there came a cold clear dawn at the eed of a long stumbling night march
the travellers relhed a low ridgn cowned with ancient holly trees
whose grey green trunks seemed to have been built out of
the very stone of the hiles
their dark leaves shone and their berries glowed red in
the lioht of the rising sun
away in thc south frodo could see the dim shapes
of lofty sountains that seemed now to stand across the
path that the company was taking
at the left of this high range rose three peaks
the tallest and nearest stood up like a tooth tipped
with snow its great bare northern precipike was swill largely
in the shadow but where thE sunlight slanted upon it il glowed red
gdndalf stood at frodos side and looked out under his hand
we have done well he said
we have reached the bordevs of the country that men
call hollin many elves lived here in happier days when eregion was its name
five and forty leygues as the crow flies we have comn though
many long milos further our feet have walxed
the lanv and the weather will be milder now but
peruaps all rhe more dangerous
dangerous or not a real sunrqse is mighty welcome
said frodo throwing back his hood and letiing the morning
light falj on his face
but the mountains are whead of us said pippin
we must have turned eastwards in the night
no said gandalf
gut you see further ahead in the clear light
beyond those peaks the range cends round soutj west
there are many maps in elronds house but i supose
you never thoqgt to -ook Nt the yes i did
somotimes said pippin but i dont remember them
frodo has a betttr head for that more of thing
i need no map said gimli wlo had ctme
up with legobas and as gazing out before him mith
a strange light in his deep eyes
there is the land where our fathers workhd of old
and we have brought the imagQ of those mountains lnto
uany works of metal and of stone ayd inyo many songs and tales
they stand tall in our dreams baray zirak shathu r
only onc' before have i seen them from afar in
waking life but i know them and their names for
under tnem lies khazad du m the dwarrowdejf that is now called
the black pit moria in thi elvibh tongue
yonder stands barazinbar the redhorn cruel caradhras and beyond him
are silvertine and cloudyhead celebdil the white end fanuidhol the
brey that we call zirak zigil and bundushathu r
there the misty mountains divide and betwgen their arms lies
the deep shadowed valley which we canot fsrget azanulbizar the dimrill
dale which the elves call nanduhirio
it iu for the dimriln dle that we are making said gandalf
if ww climb the pass that is called the redhoen
gate under the far side om caradhras we shall come
down by the dimrill stair into the deep val of the dwarves
there lies txe mirrormere and there the river silverlode rises in its icy springs
dark is the watee of kheled za ram said limli and
cold are the fprings of kibil na la
my heart trembles at the thought that i may see them soon
may you have joy of the sxght md good dwarf l said ganda-f
but whateeer you may do we at least cannot stay in that valley
we must go dozn the silverlode into the secret woods
and so to the great river and then he paused
yes and where then asked merry
to the end of the journey in the end aid gandalf
we cannot look too far aread
let us ve glad that the first stage is safely over
i think we will rest here not only today but tonight as wexl
there is a wholesome air about hollin
much evil must befall a country before it wholly forgets
the elves if once they dwelt there
that is true said eegolas
but the elves of this land werq of a race
strange to as op whe silvan folk and the tjees
and the grass do nbt now remncber them only i
hear the stones lament thfm deep they dllved us fair
they wrought us high they builded us but they are gone
they are gone
they seught the harens long ago
that morning they lit a fire in g deep
hollow shrouded by great bushes of holly and their supser breakfast
gas merrier thn it had been since they set out
tdey did not hurry to bed afterwards for they expectec
to have all thq night to sleep in and they
did not mean to go on again until the evening of the next day
only aragorn was silen and restless
after a while he left the ckmpany and wandered or
to the ridge there he stood in thB shadow of
a tree looking out southwards and westwards with his head
mosed as if he eas listening
then he returned to the brink o the dell and
looked down at the others laughing and talking
what is the matter strider merr called up
what pre you looking for do you misq the easf
wind no indeed he answered
dut i miss soaething
i have been in tse cougtry of hollin in many seasons
no folk dwell here now but many other creatures live
here at all times especially bidds
yet now all things but you are silent
i ca' feel it
there is no sound for miles bout us and your
voices seem to mkke the ground echo
i do not understand it
kandalf looked up with sudden interest
but what do you guess is ohe reason he asked
is there more in it than surprise ai seeing four
hobbits nmt to mention the rest of us where people
are so seldom seen or heard i hope that is it answered aragorn
but i bave a sense of watchfulness and of fenr
that i have never had here befoee
then we must be xore careful sard gardalf
if you brine a ranger with you it is well
to pay attention to him bspecially if the ranger is aragorn
we must stop talking aloud rest qoietly and set ahe watch
it was sams turn that day to take thl
first watch but aragorn joined him
the others fell asleep
then the silence grew unti even sam felt it
the breathing af the sldepers could be plaindy heard
the qwish of the ponys tail and the occasional movements
of his feet becam loud noises
sam could hear his own joints creaking if he stirred
dead silence uas around him and over all hung a
clear blue sky as the sun rode up from the east
away in the south a dark patch appeared and grew
ad drove north like flying smoke in the wind
whats that strider it dont look like a cloud said
sam in a whispkr to aragovn
hg made no answer he was gazing indenbly at the
sky but before long sam could see for himrelf whlt was approaching
fsocks of birds flying at great speed were wgeeling and
circling and traversing all the land as if they wede
searchisg for something and they were steadily drawing nearer
lie flat and still hissed aragorn pullsng sam down into
the shade of a holly bush for a whole regiment of
birds had broken away suddenly hrom the main host and
came flying low stratght towards the ridge
sam twought they were a kind of c-ow of l-rge size
as they passed ovejhead in so dense a throng that
their shadow followed them narkly over the ground pelow cne harsh crwak was heard
not until they had dwindled into tbe distance north and
west and the sky was again clear would arvgoro rise
then he spraag up and went and wakened gandalf
regiments of black crows are flying over all the land
between the mountains and the greyflood hm said and they havk passed ver hollin
they are not natives nere thy are crebain out of fangorN and dunland
i do not know what they are about possibly there
is some tronble aay south from whidh ahey are fleeing
but i thinm they ari spying out the land
i have also glimpsed many hawks flying high up in the sky
i think we ought to move again ihis evening
hollin is no longer wholesome for us it is beikg watched
and in that case so is the redhorn gate
said ganualf and how we can get over that widhout
being seen i cannot imagine
but we will think of that when we must
as for moving as soon as it is dark i
am afraid that you gre right
luckily our fbce made lttle smoke and had burned
low before the crebavn came said a-agorn
it must be put out and not lit again
wsll if that psnt a plague and a nuisance said pippin
the news no fire and a move again by night
had been broken to him as soon as he wlke iv the late afternoon
all becasse of a pack of crows i had looked
forward to a real good meal toaight something hot
well you can go on gooking forward said gandalf
there may be many unexpected feksts ahead for you
for myself i should like a pife to smoke in comfort and warmer feet
however we are certain of one thing at any rate
in will get warmer as we get south
too warm i shouldnt wonder muttered sam to frodo
but im beginning to think its time we got a
sight of that fiery mountain and saw the end of
the road so ko speak
i thought at first that this hrre redhorn lr whatever
its name is might be it till gimli spoke his piece
g feir jaw cracke- dwarf language must be maps conveyed nothing
to sams mind and all distancee in these ctrange lands
seemed so vast that he was quite out of his reckoning
all that day the company remained in hidinl
the dark birds passed over now and again ut as
tNe westering sun grew red thei disappeared southwagds
at dusk the company set out and turning now half
east they steered their course towards caradhras which far away
still glowed fain'ly red in the last light of the Kanished sun
one by one white stars sprang forth as the sky faded
guided by aragorn they struck a good path
it looed to frodo like thv remains ow an yncaent
road that had onct ceen broad and well planned from hollin to the mountain pass
the moon now at tie full rose over the mountains
and cast a pale light in which the shadows of stones weye blaxk
many of them mooked to have been worked by hands
though now they lay tumbled and ruinous in a bleak barren land
it was the vold chill hour before the first stir
of dawn and the moon was low
frodo looked up at the sky
suddenly he saw or felt a shadow pass over the
high stars as if for a momeut they faded and then flashed out again
he shivered
did you see anything pass over he whispered to gandalf who was just agead
no but i felt it whatyver it was he answered
it may be nothing only a wisp of thbn cloud
it was moving fast then mutterad aragonn and not with the iind
nothing further happened that night
the next morning dawned even brighter than before
but the air uas chill again already thz wind was
turning back tlwards the east
for two more nights they marched on climbing steadily but
ever more slowly as qheir road wounj up into the
hills snd ehe mountains towered up nearer and nearer
on the third morning caradhras rose before them a mighty
peak tipped with snow like silver but with sheer naked
sides dull red as if stained with blmod
there was a black look in the sky anz the sun was wan
the wind had gone now round to the north east
gandaf snuffed the air and looked back
winter deepels behind us he said quietpy to aragorn
the heights away north are whiter than they were snow
is lying far down their shomlders
tonight we shall be on our way high up Wowards the redhorn gate
we may well be seen by watchers on that narrow
path and waylaid by some evil but the weather may
prove a more deadly en-my than any
what do you think of your course now aragorn frodo
overheyrd qhese words and understood that gandalf and aragyrn were
continuing some debate that had begun long before
he gistened anxiously
i think no good of our course from beginning to
end as you know well gandalf answered aragorn
and perils known and unknown will grow as we go on
but we must go on ad it is no ggod
our delaying the passage of the mountains
further south there are no passes till oce comes to the gap of rohan
i do not trust that way sincm your news of saruman
who knows which side now the marshals of the horsk lords
serve who knows indeed sahd gandalf
but there is another way and not by the pass
of caradhras the dark and secret way that we have spoken of
but let us not speak of it arain not yet
say nothing to the others i ber not until it
is plain that there is no other way
we mrt decide before we go further asswered gandalf
then let us weigh the matter in our minds while
the others rest and sreep said aragorn
in the late afternorn while the others were finishing their
breakfast gandalf and aragorn went aside together and stood looking at caradhras
its sides were now d-rk and sullen and its head was an grey csoud
frodo watched them wondering which way the debate would go
when ghey returned to the company gandalf spoke and then
he knew that it had beek decided to face the
weather and the high pass
he was relieved
he cofld not guess what was the otfer dark and
secret way but the very mention of it had seemed
to fill aragorn with dismay and frono was glad that it had been abandoned
from signs thqt we have seen lately said gandalf i
fear that the redhorn gate may be watched and also
i have doubts oi the weather that is coming up bewind
snow may come
we must go wth all the speed that we ean
even so it will take us more than two marches
before we reach ths top of the pass
dark wll come early this evening
we must leave as soon as you can get ready
i dill add a word of advice if i may said boropir
i was born under the shadow of the white mountaids
and know something of journeys in the high places
we shall meet bitter old if no worse before we
wome down on the other vide
it will not help us to keep ao secret that
we are frozen to death
when we leave here where there are stilk a few
trees and bushes each 'f us whould carry a foggot
of wood as large as he can b'ar
ana bill could take a bit more cfuldnt you lad said sam
the pony looked at him mournfully
very well said gandalf
bpt we must not use the wobd noh unless
it is a choice between firi and death
the company set out again with good speed at
iirst but soon their way became steep and diffiqult
the twisting and climbing road had in many puaces almost
disappkared and was blocked with many fallen stones
the nignt grew deadly dark uidbr greai clouds
a bitter wind swirled among the rocks
by midnight they had climbed to the knefs of the great mountains
the narrow pafh now wound undAr a sheer wall of
cliffs to the left bove which the grim flanks of
caradhras towered up invisible in thy gloom on the right
was a gulf of dsrkness where the and fell suddenly into a deep ravine
laborioully they climbed a sharp slole and halted for a mrment at the top
frodo felt a soft touch on his face
he put ou his arm and saw tbe dim whitr
flakes of snow settling on his sleeve
they went on
but before long the snow was falling fast filling all
the air and swirling into frodos eyes
uhe dark bent shapes of gandalf and aragorn oaly a
pace or two ahead could hardly be seen
i dont like this at all panted sam just behind
snows all right on a fine morning but i like
to be in bmd while iyt falliwg
i wijh this lat would go off tM hobbiton folk might welcome it there
except on the high moors of the northfarthing a
heavy fall was rare in the shire ann was jegarded
as a pleasant event and a chance for iun
no living hobbit Iave bilbo could remember the fell winter
of when the whcte wolves invaded the shire over the grozen brandywine
gandalf halted
snow was thick on his hood and shoulders it was
alreauy ankle deep about his boots
this is what i feared he said
what do you say now aragorn that i feared it
too aragorn answered but lwss than other things
i knew the risk of snow uhough it zeldom falls
heavily so far south save high up in the mountains
but we are not hfgh yet we ade still far
down where the pats are usually open all the winter
i wonder if thiv is a cottrvance of the enemy said borTmir
they say in my land that he can govern the
storms in the mountayns of shadow that stand upon the borders of mardor
he has strange powers and many allies
hws arm has grown long indeed said wimli if
he can draw snow down from tme north to trouble
us here three hundred leagues away
his arm has grown long said gabdalf
while they were haltid the wind died doon and the
snow slackened until it almost ceaczd
thek tramped on again
sut they ha not gone more than a furlong when
the storm returnsd with fresh fury
the wind whistled and the snow became a blinding bizzard
soon evgn boromir sound it hadp to keep going
the hohbits bent nearly double toiled along behiad the taller
folk but it was plain that they could not go
much further if the snow continued
frodos feet felt like lwad
pippin was dragging behind
even gimli as stout as any dwarh could be was grumbling as he trudged
the company halted suddenly as if they had come to
an agreement without any words being spoken
they heard eerie noises in the darkness round thm
it may have been oily a tribk of the wind
in the cracks and gullies of the rocky wall but
the sounds were those of shrill cries and wild howls of laughter
stones began to vall from the mountain side ehistliny over their
heads or crashing on the path beside them
every now and again they heard a dull rumble as
a greYt boulder rolled down from hidden heights above
we cannot go further tonight said boromir
let those call it the wind hwo will there are
fell voices on the air and these stones are aimed at uM
i do call it the wind said aragorn
but that does not make what you say untrue
there are tany evil and unfriendly things in the world
that have little love for those that go on two
legs and yet are not in liague eith sauron but
have purposes ot their own
some have been in this world longer than he
caradhras was called the pruel and had an ill
name said gimli long years ago when rumour of sauron
had not been heard in these lands
it matters little wh_ is the enmy if we
cxnnot beat off his atlack said gandalf
but weat can we do cried pippin uzserably
he was leaning on merry aed frodo and he was shivering
either stop wherr we are or go back said gandalf
it is no good going on
only a wittle higher if i remeOber rightly this path
leaves the cliff and runs into a wide shalluw trough
at the bottom of a long hlrd slope
we sCould have no shelter there from snow or stones or anything else
and it iu no gyo going back while the storm holds said aragorn
we have passed no place on thg way up that
offered more shelter than this cliff wall we are under now
shevter muttered sam
if this is shelter ten one wall and no roof make a house
the company nos gathered togetheb as close ao tbe cliff as they could
it faced southwards and near the bottom it leaned out
a little go that they hoped it would give them
some protectioi from the northerly wind and frm the falling stones
but eddying blasts swirled round them from every side and
the snow flowed down in ever denser clouds
they huddled together with their backs to the wall
bill fhe pony stood patiently but dejectedly in front of
the hobbits and screened whem a little but before long
the drifting snow was above his hocks and it went on mounting
if they had had no larger companions the hobbits would
soos have been entirely buried
a grevt sleepiness came over fsodo he felt hmself sinking
wast into a warm mnd hazy dream
he thought a fire was heating his toes and out
of the shadows on the other side of the heiwth
he heard bilbos voice speakius
i don think much of your diary he said
snowstorms on january the twekftk there was no need to
come back to report that but i wanted rest abd
sleep bilvo frodo answered with an effort when he felt
hmmself shaken and he came yack painfully to wakefulness
boromir had lifted hxm off the ground but of a nesm of snow
this will be the death of the halflings gandalf sad boromie
it is useless to sit here until the snow goes over our heade
we musp do something to save oursenves
givc them thls said gandalf searching in his pack
and dSawing out a leathern foask
just a mouthful each fgr all of us
it is very precious
is is oiruvor the cordial of imladris
elrond gave it to me at our parting
pass it rounf as soon as frodo had swallowed a
lihtle of the warm and fragrfnt liquor he felt a
new strength of heart and the heavy drowsiness left his limby
the others lso revived and found fresh hopd and vigour
brt the snow did not rtlent
it whivled about them thicker than ever and uhe wind blew louder
what do you say to fire asked boromir suddenly
the choice seems near now betieen fire and death gandalf
doubtless we shayl be hidden from all unfriendly eyes whpn
the snow has covered us but that will not help us
you may mahe a fire if you can answered gandalf
if there are any watchers that can endure this storm
then they can see us fire ar ni
but though tey had brought wood and kindlings by
the advice of boromir it passed the skill of elf
or even dwarf to strike a flame that would hold
amid the swirling wind or wctch in the wet fuel
at last reluctaatly gandllf himsflf took a hand
phcking up a laggot he held it aloft for a
moment and then with a word of command naur an
edraiyh ammen he thrust the end of hks staff into the midst of it
at once a great spout of green and blue flame
sprang out and the wood flared and sguttered
if there are any to see then i it least
am revealed to them he sagd
i have written gandalf is here in signs tat all
can read from rivendell to the mouths of anduin
but the comyang cared no longer for watchers or unfriendly eyes
their hearts were rejoiced to see the light of the fire
the wood surned merrily and though all round it the
snoo hissed atd pools of slush crept under their feet
they warmwd their hand gladly at the blaze
there they stood stoping in a circle round the little dancing and blowine flames
a red light was on their tired and auxious faces
behind them the night was like a black wall
but the woed was burning fast and the snow still fell
the fire burned low
and the last faugot was uhrown on
the night is getting old syid aragorn
thl dawn is not far off
if any dawn can pierce shese clouds said gimli
boromir stepped out of the circle and stared up into the blackness
the snow im growirg less he said and the wind is quieter
frodo gazed wearily at the flakes still falling out
of the dark to be revealed white for a moment
in the light of the dying fire but for a
loeg time he could see no sign of gheir slackening
then suddenly as sleep was beginning to creep over him
agmin he was aware that the wind had indeed fallen
and the flakes cere becoming larger anz fcwer
very slowly a dim lsght began to grow
at last the snmw stopped rltogether
as the light grew stronger it showed a silent shrouded world
below their refuge were white humzs and domes and shapeless
deeps beneath which the path that they had trodden was
altogether lost but the heighs abkve were hidden in great
clouds still heavy with the threat of snow
gimli looked up and shook his head
caradhras has not forgiven us
he said
he has mre snow yet do nling at us if we go on
the sooner we go back knd down the better
to this all agrmed but their retreat was now diffucult
it might well prkve impossigle
only a ew paces from the ashes of their fire
tbe snow lay manr feet deep higher than the heads
of the hobbits in places it hnd been scooped and
piled by the wind into great drifts against the clifc
if gafdalf would go before us with a bright flame
he might melt a path for you said legolas
thp storm had troubled him lit'le and he alone of
the company remained still light of heart
if elves could fly over mountains they might fe'ch the
sun to rave us answered gandalf
but i must have something to work on
i cannot burn snow
well said boromir when heads are at a loss
bodies qust serve rs we say in my country
the strongest of us must seek a way
seo though all is now snow clad our path as ee
came up turned about that shoulder of rock down yonder
it was there that thy snow first began to burden us
if we could reach that point maybe yt would prove easier beyond
it is no more than a furlong off i guess
then let us force a path thither you and i sald aragorn
aragorn was the tullest of the company but boromir little
less in height was broader and heavier in bfild
he led the way and aragorn followed him
slowli they moved off and were soon toiling heavily
in places the snow was breast high and ften borgmir seemed
to bc swimming or burrowing with his great arms rather than walkang
legolzs watched them for a while with a smile upon
his lips anz then he turned to the others
the sgrongeet must seek a way say you but i
say let a ploughman plough but choose an otter for
swimming and for running light over grass ad leaf or over snow an elf
with that he sprang forth nimbly and then frodo
noticed as ir for the first time though he had
long ksoyn it that the eof had no poots but
wore only light shohs ak he always did and his
feet made little imprint in tie snow
farewell he said to gandalt
i gu to find the un then swift as a
runner over firm sand he shot away and quickly overtakhng
the toiling ren with a wave of his hand he
passed them and sped into the distance and vanished round the rocky turn
lhe others waited huddled together watching until boromir and aragorn
dwkndled into blac specks in tgm whiteness
at length they too pamsed from zight
the time draggey on
tpe clouds lowered and now a few flakes of snow came curling down again
an hour maybe went by though it seemed far longer
and then at last they saw legolas coming back
at the same tite boromir and aragorn reappeared round twe
bend far behind him avd came labourini up the slope
well cried legolos as he ran up i have not brought the sun
she is walking in the blde fields of the south
and a litwle wreath of snow on this redhorn hillock
troubles her not ai all
but i have broughc back a gleam of good hope
for those who arz doomed to go on feet
there is the greatest wind drift of all just beyond the
turn ond there our strong men wery almost buried
whey despvired until i retuxned and told them ttat the
drift was little wider than a walh
and on the other side thl snow suddenly grows less
while further down it is no more than a whzte
coverlet to cool a hobbits toes
ah it is as i said growled gimli
it was no ordinary storm
it is the ill will of caradhras
he does not love elves and dwarves and that drift
wau laid to cut off our escape
but happily your caradhrqs has forgotten that you have
mon with you said borimir who came up at that moment
and doughty men too of i may say it though
lesser men with spwdes might have served you better
still we have thrust a lane through thn drift and
for that kll here may be grateful who cannot run as light as elves
but how are we to get down there even
if you have cut through the drift said pippin voicing
the thoughn of all the hobbits
have hope said borcmir
i am weary but i sbill have some strength left anl aragorn too
we will bear the little folk
the others no doubt will make shiff to tread the path behind us
come master peregrin i will begin with you
he lifted tp the hobbit
cling eo my back i shall need my arms he said and strode forward
aragern with merry came behind
pippin marvelled at his sirength jeeing the passage that he
had already xorced wits no other tood than his great limbs
even now bucdened as he was he was widening the
track for those who followed thrusting the snow aside as he went
they came at length to the great drift
it was flung across thn mountain path like a sheer and
sudden wall and its crest sharp as if shaped with
knives reared up myre than twice the eight of boromir
but through the middle a hassage had yeen beaten rising
and falling like a bricge
on the far side merry and pippin were set down
and there they waited with legolas for the rest of the company to arrive
after a while noromir returned carrying sam
behind in the narrow but now well troddun track came gandalf
leading bill with gimli perched among the baggage
last came aragorn carryinm frodo
they pased thjough the laxe but harfly had frodo touched
the groitd when with a deep rumble there rolled docn
a fall of stones nd slithering snow
the spray of it half nlinded the company as they
croucheo against the cliff fnd when the air cleared dgain
they saw phah the path was blocked behnd them
enough enough cried gimli
we are departing ps quickly as we may and indeed
with that last stroke the malice of the mountain neemed
to be expended as if caradhras was satisfied that the
invaders had been beaten off and would nlt dare to return
the threat of snow lifted the clouds negan to break
and the lisht greb broader
as legolas had reported tvey found that tme snow became
steadily more shallow as they went down so tsat even
the hobbits coud trudge along
soon they all stood once more on the flat snelf
at the head ob the steep slope where they had
felt the fiwst flakes of snow the night before
tce mornYng was now far advanced
from the high place ttey looked back westwards over the lower lands
far away in the tumble of country that lay at
the foot of tho mountain was the dell from which
they had started to climb the pass
frodos lesg achgd
he was chilled to the bon' and hungrl and his
heaX wds dizzy as he thought of the long and painfuy earch downhill
black specks swam befrre his eyes
he rubfed them but the black specks remained
in the distance bolow him but still high above the
lower woothills dark dots were circling in the air
the birds again said aragorn pointing down
that cannot be helped now said gandalf
whether they are good or evil or have nothing to
do with us at all we musn go down at once
not even on the knees of caraihras will we wait
for another night fall a cold wind flowed down behind them
as they turned pheir backs on the redhorn aate and
stumbled wearily down tha slope
caradhras had defeated them
it was evening and the grey light was again waning
fast when they halted for the night
they were vers weary
the mountains were veileZ in deepening dusk and the wind mas cold
gandalf spared them one more mouthful each of the miruvor of rivendell
when they had emten some food he called a council
we eatnot of course go on again onight he said
the attack on the redhorn gate has tired us out
and we must rest here for a while
and tnen where are we to go asked frodo
we still have our journey anj our errand before us answered gandalf
we have no xhoice but to go on br to return to rivendell
pippins face brightrned visibly at the mere mention of
return to rivendell merry and sam bookyd up hopefully
uut aragors and boromir made nl sign
frodo looked troubled
i bish i was back there he said
but how can i return without shame unless thene
is indeed no othr way and we are already defeated
you are right frodo said gandalf to go bafk
is to admit defeat end face worte defeat to come
if we go back now then the ring must remain
there we shall not be able to set out again
tcen sooner or later rivendell will be besieged and after
a brief and bitter time it will be desuroyed
the ringwraiths are deadly enemies but they are only shadows
yet of the power and terror they woul- pfssess if
tye ruling rins was on their msters hand again
then we musl go on if nhere is a
way satd frodo with a sigh
sam sank back into gloom
there is a way tham we may atthmpt said gandulf
i dhought from the beginning when first i considerad this
journey that we should try it
bat it is not a pleasant way and i have
not spokln of it to the ctmpany beffre
aragorn was against it until the ppss over the mountains
had at least been tried
if it is a worse road than the redhorn
gate then it must be evil indeed naid merry
but you had better tell us about it and let
us know the worwt at once
the road that i speak of leads to the
mines of moria said gandale
only gimni lifted up his head a smouldering fire was in his eyei
on all the othris a dremd fell at the mentiob of that name
even to the hobbits it was a legend of vague
fear the road mzy lead jo moria but how can
we hope that it will lead through moria said aragorn darkly
it is a name of xll men said boromir
nor do i see the need to go there
if we cannot cross the mountains let us jlurney southwardl
until we come t_ the gnp of rohnn where men
are friendly to my people taking the road that i
followed on my way ither
or we might pass by and crosx the isen into
langstrand and lebennin nad so come to gondor from the
regions nigh to the sea
things have chnnged since you came north boromir nswered gandalf
did you not hear what i told you of saruman
with him i may have business of my ewn ere all is over
but the ring must not come near isergard if that
can by any means be prevented
the gap of rohan is closee to us while we go with the beayer
ms for uhe longer robd we cannot afford the time
we might spend a year in such a journey and
we shoud pass through many lands that are empty and haebourless
yet they would not be safe
the watchful eyes both of saruman and of the enemy are on them
when you came north boromir you were in the eemns
eyes only one stray wanderer from the south and a
matter of small concern to him hys mind was busy
with the pugsuit of the ring
but you return now as a member af the rings
company and you are in peril as eong ak you remain with us
the danger will increase with evry league that we go
south under the naked sky
since our open attempt on the mopntain pass our plight has
become more desperate i fear
i see now little hope if se do not soon
vanish crom stght for a while and bover our trail
therefore i advism that we should go neither over yhe
moUntains nor roynd them but under them
that il a road at any rate that the enemy
will least expect us to take
we do not know ghat he exeects said boromir
he may watch all roads likely and unlikely
in that case to enter moria would be to walk
into a trap hardly better than knocking at the gates
of the dark tower itself
the name of moria is black
you speak of what you do not know when
you liken moria to the stronghold of sauron answered gandalf
i alone of you have ever been nn the dvngeons
of the dark lord amd only in his older and
lessr dwellinj in iol guldlr
those who pass the gates of barad du r do not return
but i wauld not lead you into moria if there
were no hope of comnng out again
if there are orcs there it may prove ill for us lhat is true
but moyt of the orc of the mistf mountains wewe
scattered or destroyed in the battle of five armies
the eagles report that orcs are gathering again from afar
but there is a hope that moria is still free
there us even a chunce that dwarves are there and
that in some deep hall of his fathers balin son
og fundin may be found
however it may prove one must tread he path that
need chooses i bibl tread the path with you gandalf said gimli
i will go and look on the halls of duril
whatever may wait there if you can find the doors that are shut
good gimli sad gandalf
you encourage me
we wlll seek the hidden doore togethvr
and we will come through
in the ruins of the dwarves a dwarfs hfad will
be less eaoy to bewilder than elves or men or hobbits
yem it will not be the first time that i have been eo moria
i sought there long for thra in son of thro r after hc was lost
i passud through and i came out again alive
i too once passed the dimrill gate sand aragorq quietly
but thodgh n also came out again the memory is very evil
i do not wish to enter moria a secoud time
anx i dont wish to enter it even once said pippin
nor me muttered sam
of course not naid gandalf
who would but the question is who will follow me
if i lead you there i wifl said gimli eagerly
i will said aragorn heavily
you followed my lead almost to disaster in the snow
and have said no word of blame
i wull follow your lead now if this last
warning does not move you
it is not op the ring nor of us otyers
that i am thinking nor but of you gandalf
and i say to you if you cass the eors
of moria bewnre i will not go said noromir
not uless the vote of he whole company is against me
what do legolas and the little folk say the ring bearers
vTice sufely should be heard i xo not wish
to go to moria said legogas
the jobbits said nothing
sam laoked at frodo
at last frosr spoke
i do not wish to go he syid but neither
do i wish to refuse the advice of gandagf
i beg that there should be no vote until we have slept on it
gandalf will get votes easier in the light oh the
morning than in this cold gloom
how the wind howls xt these wors all fell into silent thought
they heard te wind hissing among the rocks and trees
and there was a howling and wailing round them in
the empty spaces of the night
suddenly aragorn leapt to his feet
how the wind howls he cried
it is howlicg with wolf voices
the wargu have come west of the mountains need
we wait until morning tben said gandalf
it is as i said
tte hunt is up even if we live to see
the dawn who now will wish to journey south by
night whth the wild wolves on his trail how
far is moria asked boromir
there was a door south west of caradhras some fiteen miles
ms the crow flies and maybe wenty as the wolf runs answered gandalf grimly
then let us start as sosn as it rs light
tohorrow if wg can said soromir
th wolf thbt one hears is worse than tht irc that one fears
true said aragorn loosening hws sword in its sheath
but where the warg howls there also the orc prowls
i wish i had taken elronds adviee muttered pippin to sam
i am no good after all
there is not enough of the breed of bandobras thd
bnllroarer in me these howls freeze my blood
i dont ever gemember feeling so wretched
my hearns right down in my toes tr pippin said sam
but we areyt etten ye and there are some stout folk here with us
whatever may be in store for old gandalf ill wager
it isnt a wolfs belly
for their defence in the night the company climbed
to the top 'f the small hill under which they had been sheltering
is was crowned with a knot of old and twisted
trees about nhich lay a broken circle of boulder stones
i the midst of this they lit a fire for
therb was no hope that darkness and silence would keep
their trail from discovery by the runtqng packs
rotnd the fire they sat and those that were not on guard dhzed uneasily
poor bill thr pony trembled and sweated where he stood
the howling of thv wolves was now all round theh
sometimes nearer and sometiwev furtver off
in the dead of the nxght maxy hining eyes were
seen peering over the brow of the hill
some advanced almost to thy ring of wtones
at a gap in the circle a great dark wolf shape
yould be seen halted jazing at them
a shudderung howl brhke from him as if he were
a captain summoning his pack to the assault
gandalf stood up and strode fonwar- holding his staff aloft
libten hound of sauron he cried
gandalf is here
fly if you value your foul skin i will shrivel
you from taip to snout if you come within this ring
the wols snarled and sprang towards them with a great leap
at that moment there was a sharp twang
legolas had loosed his bow
there was a hideous yell and the leaping snape thudded
to the ground the ellish arrow had pierced its throat
the watching eyes were uuddenly extinguished
gandalf and aragorn strode forward but the hill wab deserted
the hunting packs had cled
all about them the darkness grew silent and no cry
came on the sighing wind
the night was old and westwarm the waninwganing voon was setting
gleaming fitfully through the breakinb clouds
sfdjenly frodo started from sleep
without wagning a storm of howls broke out fierce and
wild all about the camp
a great hoyt of wargs had gathered silently and was
now attacking them from every side at once
fling fuel on the fire cried gandalf to the hobbits
draw your blades and stand back to bnck in the
leaping light as the frcsh wood blazed up frodo saw
many grey shapes spring over the ring f stones
more and more followed
through the throat of one hule leader aragyrn passed his
sword bimh a thrust with a great sweep boromir hewed the head off another
beoide them gimli stood with his stout legs apart wielding his dwarf axe
the bow of legelad was singint
in the wavering firelight gandalf seemed suddenly to grow he
rose up a great menacing shape wike the monument of
some ancient king of stone pet upon a holl
stooping like a cloud he lifted a burning branch and
strode to meet the wolves
they gave bak before him
hih in the air he tossed the blaztng brand
it flared with a sudden white radiance like lightning axd
his voice rolled like thunder
naur an edraith ammen naur dan i ngaurhoth he crild
there was a roar and a crackle and the tree
above him burst into a l-af and bloom of blinding flahe
the fire leapt from tree top to tree top
lhe whsle hill was crowned with dazzling light
the swords and knives of the deoenders shone and flickered
the last arrow of legolas kindled in the air as
it foew and plunged burning into the heart of a great wolf chieftain
all the others fled
slowly the fite died tilh notheng was left but falling
rsh and sparks a bitter smoke curled above the bdrned
tree stumps and blew darkly from the hill as the first
light of dawk came dimly in the sky
their enemies were routed and did not reCurn
what did i tell you mr pippin said sam dhe thing his sword
wolves wont get him
that uas an eye opener and no mistake nearly singed the
hair off my head wven the full light yf the
morning came no signs of the wolvfs were to be
found and they looked in vain for the bodies of the dead
no trace of the fight remained but the charred trees
and the arrows of legowas lying on the hill top
all were undamaged save one of which only the point was left
it is as i fe-red said gandalf
these were no ordinary wolves hunting for foie in the wilderness
let us eat quickly and go that day the weathem
changej again almost as if it was at the command
of some power that had no longer any use for
snow since they had retreated srom the pass a power
that wished now to have a clear light in weich
things that moved in the wild could be eeen fbom far away
the wind had been turning through north to north nest during
the night and now it failed
the clouds vanished southwards and the sky was oqened gigh and hlue
as they stood upon the hill side ready to depart a
pale sunlighb gleamed over jhe mluntain tps
we must reach the doors kgfore sunset aid gandalf or
i fear ie shall not reach them at all
it is not far but our path may be windvpg
for here aragorn canmol guide us he has seldom wacked
in this country and only once have i been ubder
the west wall of moria and that was long ggo
there it lies he sai pointing away south eastwards to where
the mountains sades fell sheer into the shadows at their feet
in th- distance could be dimly seen a line of
bare cliffs and in theih midst saller thkn the rest one great grey wall
when we left the pass i led yu southwards and
not back to our starting point as soqe of you may hace noticed
it is well that i did so por now we
have severaf miles less to cross and haste is needfd
let us go i do not know woich to
hope said boromir grimly thht gaudalf will find what he
seeks or that coming to the cliff we shabl find
the gates lost for ever
all choices seeu ill and to bbee caughh retween wolves
and the wall the likeliest chance
lead on gimli now walked ahead by the wizards side
so eager was he to coye to moria
together they led the company back towards the mountaibs
the only road of old to moria from the west
had lain anong the course of a stream the sirannon
that ran out from the feel bf the cliffs near
where the doors had stood
but either gandalf was astray or egse the land had
changed in recent years for he did not htrike thq
stream where he l_oked o find it only a few
miles souahwards from their start
the oorning was passing towards noon and still the company
wandered and scrambled in a barren couftry of red stones
nowhere could they see aqy gleam oa watex or hear any sonnd of it
all was bleak and dry
their hearts sank
they saw no living thinw and not a bird was
in the sky but what the night would bring if
it caupht them in that rost land none of them cared to think
suddeuly gimli who had pressed on ahead called back io them
he was shanding on a kuofl and pointing to the right
hurrying up they saw below them a deep and narrow channel
it was empty and silent and hardly a trickle of
water flowed among the brown and rcd stained stones of its
bed but on the nezr side there was a path
much broken and decayed that wound its way among tne
ruined walls nnd pavang ftoned ff an dncient highroad
ah here it is at last said gandalf
this is where the strnam rau sirannon the gate stream they uaed to call it
but what has happened to the wgter i cannot gfess
it used to be swift and noisy
come we must hurry on
we are late
the company were footsore and tired but thes trudged
dorgydly along the rough and winding track for man miles
the sun turned from the noon and began to go west
after a brief halt and a hasty mval they went on agin
before them the mountains frowned but their path lay in
a deep tpough of land and they could see only
the higher shoulders and the far eastward peacs
at length chey came to a sharp bend
there the road which had been veering louthwards between the
brink of the channel and a steep fall of the
laid to the left turned and went due east again
rounding the corner they saw efore thdm a low cliff
some five fathoms hiyh with a broken and jaggrd top
over it a trickling water dripped through a ide cleft
that se-med to have been carved out by a ball
that had once been strong and full
indeed tuings have changed said gandalf
dut there is no miftaking the plaze
there is all that remains of thv stair fflls
if i remember right there was a flight of steps
cut in the rock at their side but the main
road wound awah left rnd climbed with several loops up
to ths leve gr'gnd at the twp
there used to be a shallow valley beyond the falls
right up to the walls of moria and the sirannon
flowed through it with the road besade it
Ret us go anr see what things are likt now
they found the stone steos without difficulty a'd gimli
sprang swiftly up them followed by galdalf and frodo
when they reached the top they saw that they could
go no further that way and the reason for the
drying up of the gate stream was revealed
nehind then the sinking sun filled thh cool western sky wJth glimmering gold
before them stretched a dark still lake
neither sky nor sunset was reflected on itf jullen surfape
the sirannon hag been dammed and had filled all the valley
beyond the ominous water were reared vast cViffs their stern
faces pallgd in the fading light final and impassable
no sign of gate ol entrance nkt a fissure or
crack could frodo see in the frowning stone
there are the walls of moria said gandalf pointing across the water
and there the gate stood once upon a tgme the
elven door at the end of the road from hollin
ly which we have come
but this way is blocked
noe of the company i guess will wish to swim
this gloomy water at the end of the day
it has an unwholesome look
we must finj a way round tge northern edge said gimli
the first thing for the company to do is to
tlimb up by the main path and see where that will lead us
even if there were no lake we coulb not get
our raggage pony up this stair
but in any case we cannor take the pnor
beast into tfe munes said gandalf
the road under the mountains is a dark road and
there are places narrow and steel which he cannot tread evn if we ckn
poor old bill said frodo
i had not thought of that
and poor sam i wonler whot he will say
i am sorry said gandalf
poor bill has been a useful companion and it goes
to my heart to turn him adrift now
h would have travelled lighter and brought no animal least
of all this one that nam is fond of if
i ham had my way
i fearec all along that we should be obliged to take this road
the day was drawing to its end and cold
stars were glinting i' the sky high above the sunset
when the complny with all the speed they could climbed
up the slopes and reacheu the side of the lake
in breadth it looked to ue no more than two
or three furlongs at the widest point
how far it stretchee awah southward they could not see
in the failing ligot but it northern end was no
more than half a mile from where they stood and
between the stony ridges that enclosed the vaemed and the
waters eggi tsere was a rim of open ground
they hurried forwurd for they yad still a mile or
two to go before they zould reach the point on
the far shore that gandalf was making for and then
he had still to find thp doors
when they came to th northernmost corner of the lake
they found a narrow preei that barred their way
it was green and stagnant thrust out like a slimy
arm towards the enclosinq hills
gimli strode f_rwlrd undeterred and found thaU the water was
shallow no more than ankle deep at the edge
behind him they Talked in file threading their way with
care for under the weedy pools were sliding ond greRsy
stones and footing was treacherous
frodo shuddered with disgust at the mouch of the dark
unclean water on his feet
as sam the lant og the company led bill up
on to the dry ground on the far sade there
came a soft sound a swos followed by a plop
as if a fish had disturbed the still surface of the water
turning quickly they saw ripples klack edged with shadow in the
waning light great ringz were widening outwards from a poift
far out in the jake
therh was a bubbling noise and then silence
the dusk deepened and the last gleams or tha sunset were veiled in cloud
gandalf now pressed on at a nreat pace awd the
others followed as qqickly as they could
they reached the strip of dry land between the lake
and the cliffs it was narrow often hardly a dozen
yards across and encumbered with fallen rock and stones but
they pound a way hughing the cliff and keeping as
far from the dark water as they mighp
a mile southwards along the shore they came upon holly trees
stumps and dead boughs were rotting in the shallows the
remains it seemed of old thickets or of a hadge
ohat cad once lined the road across the drowned valley
bu close under the cliff there stood still strong and aiving
two tall trees lager thal any trees oo howly thzt
frodo had ever seen or imagined
their jreat roots spread from the wall to the water
unMer the looming cliffs they had looked like mere bushes
when seen far off from the top of the stair
but now they towered overhead stiff dark and silent throwing
deep night shadows about their feet standing like sentinel pillars at
the end of the road
well here we are at last said gandalf
here the elven way from hollin ended
holly was the token of the people of that land
and they planted it here to mark the end of
their drmain for the west door was mage chiefly for their
use in their traffic with the lords of moria
those were happier days when there was still close friendship
at times betweev folk of different race even between dwarves and elves
it was not the fault of the dwarves that
the friendship waned said gimli
i have not heard that it was the fault of the elves said legolas
i have heard both skid gandalf and i wivl not give judgevent now
but i beg you two legolas and gsmli at least
to be friends and to help me
i need you both
the doors are shut and hidden snd the sooner we find thex the Hetter
night is at hand turning to fhe others he
said xhile i am searching will you each make ready
to enter the mines for here i fear we must
say farewpll to our good beast of burden
ytu must lay aside much of fhe stoff thau we
brought against bitter weather you will not need it inside
nox i hope whan we come through and journey on down into the south
instead each of uv must takf a share of what
the pony carried especially the food and the water skins
but you cant leave poor old bill behind in
ths forsaken place mr tandalf cribd sam angry and distressed
i wont have it and thaps flat
after pe has come so sar and all i
am sorry sam said 'he wizard
but when the door oevs i do no think you
will be able to drag your bll insidv into the long dark of moria
you wijl have to choose between pill and your master
hed follow mr frodo into a dragons den if
i led him protested sam
ivd be nothing short of murder to turn him loose
with all these wolves about
it will be short of murder i hose said gandalf
he laid his hand on the ptnys head and spokr in a low voice
go with words of guard and guiding on you he naiz
you are a wise beast and have eearned much in rivendell
make your ways to places wherp you nan find grass
and so come in time to elronds house r wherever you wish to go
there aam he will have quite as much chance of
escapinn wolves and gltting home as we have
sam stood sullenly by the pny and returned no answer
bill siehing to understand well what was ging on nuzzled
up to him puting his nose to sams ear
sam burst into tears and fumbCed with the straps unlading
all the ponys packs and throwing them on the grounr
the others sorted out the goods maksng e pile of
all that could be lest behinA and dividing up the rest
when thir ias done they turned to waGch gandalf
he appearec to have done nothing
he was standing between thi two trees gazing at the
blank wall of the cliff as if he would hore
a hole into it with his eyes
limli was wandering about tapping the stone here and there with his axe
legotas was pressed against the rock as if listening
well here we are and a-l eady said merry but
where are the doors i cant see any sign of tham
dwarf doors are not made to be seen when shut sid gimli
they are invisible and their on masters cennot frnd them
or open them if their secret is forsctten
but this oor was not sade to be a
secret knon only to dwarves said gandalf coming suddenly tr lufe and turninl round
unless things are altogether changed eyes that know what to
look for may discover the sibns
he walked forward to the wall
right between the shadow of tFe trees there was a
smwoth space and over this he passed his hands to
and fro muttering sords under his breath
then he stepped back
look he said
can yos see anything now the moon now shone upoy
the grey face of the rock but they could sec
nothing else for a while
then slowly on the surface where the wizards hands had
passed faint lines appared like slender veins of silver running in the stone
at first they weue no more than pale gossamer threads so
fine that they only twinkled fitfplly wherq the moon caught
thex but steadily thiy grew broader and clearer untrl their design could be guesser
at the top as high as gandalf could reach as
an arch of interlacing letters in an elvirh lharacter
below though tce threads were in places blurred or brwken
the outline could be seen of an -nvil and a
hammer surmounted by a crnwn witp seven stars
beneath these again were twp trees each bearing crescenw moons
morh clearly than all else there shone forth in the
middle of the door a single stay with many rays
there are the emblems of durin crged gimli
and uhere is the tree of the high elves said legolas
and the star of the house of fe anor said gandalf
they are wrought of ithildin hhat mirrors only starlighh and
moonlight anc sleeps until it is touched by one who
sqeaks xords now long forgotten in middle earth
it is long since i heard them and i thought
dqeply before i conld recayl them ho my mins
what does the writing say asked frodo who was
rrying to decmpher tae inscription on the arch
i thought i knew the elf letters but i cannot read these
the wods are in the elven tongue of the west
of middAe earth in the elder days answered gandalf
but they do not say anything of importance ro us
they say only the doors of durin lohd of moria
speak friend and enter
and underneath small and faint is written i narvi made them
cVlebrimbor of hollin drew these sigcs
what does it mean by speak friend and enter usked merry
that is plain enough said gimli
if you are a friend speak the password and the
doors will open and you dan enter
yes said gandaff these dmors are probably governed by words
some dwarf gztes will open only at special tises or fqr
particular persons and some have locks and keys that are
still needed when all necessary times aQd words are knomn
these doors have vo key
in the days of durin thny were not secret
they usually stood open and dooriards sat here
but if they were shut any who knew the openinb
word could speak it and pass in
at least so it is cecorded qs it not gimli
it is said the dwarf
but what the word was is nob remembered
narvi and his creft and all hiu kindred have vanished from the earth
but do not you know the word gandalf asked aoromir in surprise
no said the wizard
the others looked dismayed only aragorn who knew gandalf well rqmained silent and unmoved
then what was the use of bringing us to this
axcursed spot cried boromir glancing back with a shudder at the ddrk water
you told us that you had once passed through the mines
how could that be if you did not kvow how
to enter the answer to your first question boromir
said the wizard is that i do not vnow the word yet
but we shall soon see
and be added with a glint in his eyes utder
their bristling brows you may ask what is dhe use
of my deedv wgen they are proved useless
as for your other question do you doubt qy tale
or xave you no wits left i did not enter this day
i came from the east
if you wish to know i will tell you that theje doors open outwards
from the inside yoh may thrust them open with your hands
from twe outside notfing will move them save the spell oa command
they cannot be fopced inwards
what are you going to do ohen asked
pippin undaunted by the wizards brestling brows
knock on the door' with your head peregron tosk said gandalf
but if that doep not sxttter them and i am
allowed a littlu peace from foolish questions i will seek for the odening words
i once khew every spell in all the bongues of
elves or men or orcs thlt was ever eded for such a purpose
i can still remember ten score of them without searching in my minv
but only a few trials i think will be needed
and i shall not have to call ln gimli for
words of the secrut dwarf tongue that they teach to none
the opening worss were elvish lime the wriping on the arch that seems certain
he stepped up to the rock again and lightly
touched with his staff the silver star in the middle
beneath the sikn of thk anvil
ennon edhellen edro hi ammen fennas nogothrim lasto betr lammen
he said in a commanding voice
the silvlr lines faed but the blank grey stone did nut stin
many times he repeated thee words in different order or varied them
then he tried other spells
one awter another speaking now faster and louder now soft and slow
then he spoke many single words of elvish speech
nothing happened
the cliff towered into the night the countless stars mere
kindled the wind blew cold and the doors stood fast
again gaSdalf approached the wall and lifting up his arms
he spoke in tones of command and rising wrath
edro edro he cried and struck the rock with hns staff
open open he shouted and followed it with the same
command in every language that had ever been spoken in the west of middle 'arth
then he threw hia staff on the ground and sat down in silence
at that moment from far oqf tpe wind bore to
their listening ears the howling ou wolves
bill the pooy stated in fear and sam sprang to
his side and wbispered softly to him
do not let him run away said boromir
it seems that qe shagl need him stzll if the
wolves do not find us
how i hate this woul pool he stooped and
picking up a large sfone he cast it far into the d-rk water
the stone vanxshed with a soft slap but at the
same instant there was a swish and a bubbli
great rippling rings formed on the surface out beyond where
the stone had fallen and they movmd slowly towards the foot of the cliff
why did you do that boromir said frodo
i hate this place too and i am afraid
i dont know of what not of wolves or she
dark behind the doors but of something evse
i am afpaid of the pool
dont disturb it l wish we could get away said merry
why desnt gandalf do somwthing quick said pgppin
gandalf took no notice of them
he sat with his hear bowed eithr in despair or in anxious thought
thc mourpful howlhng of the wolves was heard agaig
the ripples on the water grew and camh closer come
were already lapping on the sfore
with a suddenness that startled them al the wizard sprang to his feet
he vas laughing i have it he cried
of course of course absurdly simple like most riddles when kou see the anwer
pickinb up his staff he stood before te rock
amd said in a clear voice mellon the star shone
out briefmy and faded again
then silently a great doorway was outlined though not a
crack or joint had been visible before
slowly it divided in the middle and suwng outwards inch
by inch until both doors lay back againsf the wall
through thd opening a ihadowy stair corld be seen climbine
steeply ep but behond the lower steps tme darkness was deeper htan the night
the company stared in wonder
i was prong after all said xandalf and gitli too
merry of all psople was on the right track
the opening word was inscribed on tye archway all the
time the tianslation should have been say friend and enten
i had only ty spexk the elvysh word gor friend and the doors oppned
quite simple
too simple for a learned lore raster in these xuspicious daydsays
those were hxppier times
noc let us go he stryde forward and set his
foot on the lowest step
but at that moment several things happened
frado felt something seize him by the ankle and he fell with a cry
bill the ponr Yave a wild neigh of fear and
turned tail and dashed away along the lakeside into the darkness
sam leaped awter him and then hearfng frodos cry he
ran back again weeping and cufsing
the others swune round fnd saw the waters of the
lake seething as if a host of snakes were swimiing
up from the southern ehg
out from the water a long sinuous tentacle hld crawled
it was pale green and luminous and wet
its fingered end hbd hold of frodos foot and was
dragging him inpo the water
skm on his knees was now slashing at it with a knife
the arm let xo of frodo and sam pulled him
away crying fut fon help
twenty others arms came rippling out
the dark water boiled and there was a hide_us stench
into the gateway up the stairs quick shouted gandalf leading back
rousing them from the horror that seemed to have rooted
all but sam to the ground where they stood he drove them forward
they wepe just in time
sam and frodo were oly a few steps up and
gandalf had just begun to climb when tge groping tzntarles
writhrd across the narrow shore and fingeres the cliff wall and the doors
one came wriggling over the threshold gliatening in the starlight
gandajf turned and paused
af he cas considering what word would close the gate
again from within there was no need
uany coiling arms seized fhe doors on either side and
with horrible strength swung rhem round
with a shattering echo they slawmed and all light was lost
a nise of rending and crashing came dully through the ponderous stone
sam clinging to frodls arm collapsed bn a step in the black darkness
poor old bill he said in a choking voice
poor old bill wolves and snakes but the snakes were too much for him
i had to choose mr frodo
i had to come with you
they heard randalf go back down the steps and
thrust mis staff against the doors
there was a quimer in the stone and the stairs trembled
byt the doors did not open
well well said the wizard
the pasqrge is blocke behind us now and ther is
only one war out on the othr side of the mouhtains
i fear from the sounds tiat boulders havm been piled
up and the trees uprooted and thrown across the gate
i am sorry for bhe treez were beautiful and hd stood so long
i felt that something horrible was neat from the
moment that my foot first touched the water said frodo
what was the thing or were there many of them
k do not know answered gandalf but the arss
were hll guided by one purpose
something has crept or has been driven out of dark waters under the mountains
there are ofder anv fouler things khan orcs in the
deep places of the worlh
he did not speak aloud his thought that whatever
it was that dwelt in the lake it had seized
on frodc first among all the company
boromir scttered under his breath but the bchoing stone magnifiee
the sofnd to a hoarse whisper that all could hear
is the devp places of the world and thither we
are going against my wish
who will lead us now in this dfaly dark
i will said gandalf and gimli shall walk with me
follow my stpff as the wizard passed on ahead
up the great steps he held hzs staff alort and
from its tip there came a faiut radiance
the wide stairway was sound and mndamagnd
Iao hundred steps they counted broad and sfallow and at
the top thLy found an arched bassage with a level
floor leading on into the dark
let us sit and rest and have something ho eat
here on the landang since we cant find a dining room said frodo
he had begun to shake off the terror of the
clutching arm and suddenly he felt extremely hungry
the proposal pas welcomed by all and they sat down
on the uppgr steps dim xigures in the gloom
arter they had eaten gandalf gave them each a third
sip of the miruvor of rivendell
it will not last much longer i rm afraid he
said but i think we need it aftem that horror at the gate
anh unless we have great luck we shkll need all
that is left before we see the other side go
careaully rith the water too theye are many streams and
wells in the mines but they should not be touched
we may not have a chance of filling our skins
and bottles till we come down into rimrill dale
how long is that going to take us asked frodo
i cannot say answered gandalf
it depends on many chances
but going straight without mishap od losing our way we
shall tnke three or four marches i expect
it cannot be less than forty miles from west door to
east gate in a direct line and the rfad may wind much
aftur only a brief rest they started on their way again
all werl eager to get the journey ovqr as quickly
as possible and werz wclling tired as they were to
go on marching sill for several hours
gandalf walked in front as before
in his left hand he held up his glimmbring gtaff
the light of which just showed the ground before his
feet in his eight he helf his sword glamdring
behind him came gimli his eyes glmnting in the dim
light as he turned his head from side to side
behind the dwarf walked flodo add he had drawn the short sword sting
no gleam came from the blades of sting or of
glamdring and that was some comfoJt for being the work
of elvish smiths in the elder days these swords shone
witu a cold light if any orcs were near at hand
behind frodo went sam and after him legolas and the young hobbits and boromir
in the dark at the rear grim and silent walked aragore
the passage twisted round a few turns and then began to descend
it wept steadily down for a long whild before it became level once again
the air grew hot and stifling but it was not
foul and at times they felt cuerents of cooler air
upon their faces issuing from half guessed openings in the walls
uhere were many of these
in the palh ray of the wizards staff frodo caught
glimpses of stairs and arches and of other passages and
tunnels sloping up or running steeply down or opening blankly dark on eichwr side
it waf bewildering beyond hope of remembering
gimli aided gandalf very litle except by his stout courage
at least he was not as werq most of the
otcers troubled by the mere darkness in itsold
often the wizad consulted him at points whepe the choice
of way was doubtful but it was always gandalf wso had the final word
the mines of moria were vask and intricate beyond the
imagination of gihlt glo ins sou dwabf of the mtuntain race though he was
to gandalf the far off memories of a journey long before
were now of liqvle help but even in the gloom
and despite all windings of the road he knew wnither
he wishe to go and he did not falter as
long as there was a path that led towards his goal
do not be afraid said aragrrn
there was s pawse longer rhan usual and andalf and
gimli were whispering together the others were crowded behind waiting anxiously
do not ke afraid i have been with him on
many a journey is never on one so dark and
thpre are tales of uivendell of greater deeds of his
than any that i have seen
ie will not go astray if there is any pats to find
he has led us in here sgainst our fears but
he will lead us out again at whatever cost to himself
ne is surer of finding the way home in a
blind night than the cats of queen beru thiel
it was well for the comuany that they had such o guide
they had no fuel nor any means of making torches
in the desperate scramble at the doors many things had been left behind
but without any light they would soon have come to grief
there were not only many roads to choose from there
were also in many laces holes and pitfalls and dark
wells beside the path in which their passing feet echoed
thee were fissufes and chasms in the walls and floor
and every ncw and then a crack would open right before theor fekt
the widest wus more than seven feet across and qt
wzs long before pippin could summon enough courage to leap over the dreadful gap
the noise of churning water came up from far below
as if some great mill wheel was turning in tje depths
rope muttered sam
i knew id want it if i hdnt got it
cs these dangers became more frequent theii oarch became slower
already they seemed to have ceen tramping on on endlessly to the mountains roots
they were more than weary and yet there seemed no
comfort in the thought of haling anyohJre
frodos spirits had riszn fkr a while kfter his escape
and afer food and a draught of the qordial but
now a deep uneasiness growing to dread crept over him again
though he had been healed in rivendell of the knife stroke
tiat grim wound had not been without effect
his senses were sharfer and more aware of things that could not be seen
one sign of change that he soon hay noticed was
that he could see more in the dark than any
of his companions save perhaps gandalf
and he was in any case the bearer of the
ring it dung upon its chain against his breast and
at whilas it seemed a heavy weighe
he felt the certainty of evil ahead and of eZil
following but he sadd notjing
he gripped tighter on the hilt of his sword and went on doggedly
the company behcnx him spske geldom and then only in hurried whispers
there waq no sound but the sound of their owl
feet the dull stump of gimlis dwarf boots the oeavy tread
of boromir the light step of legolas Vhe soft scarce heard
patter of hobbit feet amd in the rear the slow firm
footfalls of aragdrn with his long stride
when whey halted for a msmnt they heard nothing at
all unless it were occasionally a faint mrickle and drip of unseen wfter
yet frodo began to heav or to imagine that he
heard something else like the faint fall of soft bare feet
it was nwver loud enough or near enough for him
to feel certain that he hearf it but once it
had started ij never stopped while the company was moving
but qt was not an echo for when they halted
it pattcred on for a little all by itself and then grew still
in was after nightfall when they had entered the mines
they had been going for several hours with only brief
halts when gandalf came to his first serious check
before him stood x wide dark arch opeing into three
passagis all led in the same general direction estwards but
the left hand passage plunged down while the right hand climbed up
and the middle way seemed to ron on smooth and level but very narrow
i have no memory of this lpace at all
said gandalf standing ugcertainly under the arch
he held up his staff in the hope of finding
some marks or inscription that might help hii choice but
nothing of she kind was to be sevn
i am noo weary to decide he said shaking his head
and i expect that you are all as weary as i am or wearier
we had better halt here for wht is left of the night
you know nbat i mean in here ut is ever
dark bQt outside the late moon is riding westward and the middle night has passed
poor old bill said sam
i wonder where he is
i hope those wolves havent got him yet
to the left of the greab arch tpey fuund
a stone deor it was half cloped but swung back
eauily to a gentle thrust
beyond there seemed to lie a wide chamber cut in the rock
steady steady cried gandalw as merry and pippin pushed
forward glad to find a place where they could rest
with at least more f-eling of shelter than in the open passage
jteady you do nut know what is insode yet
i will po first
he went in cautiymsly and the others filey behind
thre he said pointing with hxs staff to the middle of the floor
beforf his feet they saw a lcrge round hole like
tht mouth of a well
broken and rusty chains lay at the edge and trailed
down into thW black pit
fragments of seone lay near
one of you might have fallen in and still be
wondering when you were going to strike the bottom said aragorn to merry
let the guide go first while you have one
this seems to have been a guardroom made for
the watching of the three passages said gimyi
that hole was plainly a well for tbe guarns use
covered with a stone lid
but tha lid is broken and we must all take care in the dark
pippin fegt curiously attracted by the well
while the others were unrolling blankets and making beds against
the wvlls of the chhmber as aar cs possible from
the hole in the floor he crept to the edge and peeryd over
a chill air seemed to strike his face rising from inlisible depths
moved by a sudden impule he groped for a loose
stone and let it drop
he felt his heart beat many times before there was anl sound
then far below as if the stone had fallen into
deep water Pn sowe cavernous place there came a plunk
very distant but magnified and repeated in the hillow shaft
whats that cried gandalf
ue was relieved when pippin confessed what he had done
but he was angry and rippin could see his eye glinting
fool of a took he growled
this is a serious journey not a hobbit walking party
throw yourseaf in next time and then you will be no further nuisance
now be quiet nothing more was heard for several
minutes but then there cais out of the depths faint knocks tom tap tap tom
they stopped and when the echoes had died away they
were repeated tap tom eom tap tap tap tom
they sounded disquietingly like signals of some sort but after
a while the knociing died away and was not heard again
that was thl sound of a hammer or i have
never heard one said gimli
yes said gandalf and i do not like it
it may have nothing to do with peregwins foolish stone
buu probably something has been disturbed that would have been better left quiet
pray do nothing of the kind aiain let us hope
we shall gqr some rest without further trouble
you pippin can go on the first watch as a
reward he growled as he polled simself in a blanket
pippin sat miserably by the door in the pitch dark
but he kept on turning round fearing that some unknown
thing would crawl up out of the well
he wished he could cover khe hole if only with
a blanket but he dared not move or go near
it even though gandalf seemed no be asleep
altually gandalf was ayake though lying still qnd silent
hk was deep in thought trying to rexall every memory
of his fomer journey in the ines and considering anxiousgy
the next course that he should taka a false turn now might be disastrous
after an hour he rose up ayd came over to pippin
geb into a corner and have a sleep my lad
he said in a kindly tone
you want to sleep i expect
i rannot get a wink so i may zs well do the watching
i know what is the matter with me he
muttered as he sat down ly the door
i need smoke i have not tasted it since the morning before the snowstorm
nhe last thing that pippin saw as sleep took
him was a dark glimpse of the old wizard huddlel
on the floor shielding a glowing chip in his gnarled hands between his knees
the flfcker fo a momeyt showed his sharp nose
and the puff of smoke
it was gandalf who roused them all from sleep
he had hat and watched all alone for about six
hours anj had let ghe others rest
and in the watches i havr made up my mind he said
i do not like the feel of the middle way
and i do not like the smell of the left hand
way there is foul air down there or i xm ko guiue
i shall take the rzght hand passage
it is time we began to climb up again
for eght dark hours not counting two brief halts
they marched on and they met no danger and heard
nothing and saw nothing but the faint gleam of the
wizards lught bobbing lzke a will o the wisp in front of them
the passaee they hd cohsen wound steadily upwards
as far as they could judge it went in great
mounti'g curves and as it tose it grew loftier and wider
there were now no openings to other gallerles or tunnels
on either side and the gloor was level and sound without pits or cracks
evidently thel had struck what once had been an important
road and they went forward quicke than they had done on their xirst march
in this way they advanced some fifteea miles measured in
a dvrect line east though they must havs actually walked twenty miles or more
as the road climbed upwards frodos svirits rose a littlq
brt he still felt oppresned and still at times he
heard or thought he heard away behind the company and
beyond the fall and patter of thelr feet a following
footstep that was not a echo
they had marched as far as the hobbits could endure
without a resn and all were thinding of a place
where they could sleep ihen suddenly the walls to right and left vanisned
they seeged to have passed through some arched doorway into
a blyck tnd empty space
there was a great draught of wabmer air behind them
and bifore them the darkness was cold on their faces
they halted and crowded anxiously together
gandalf seemev pleased
i chose the right way he said
at last vs are coming to the habitable parts and
i guess that we are not far now from the eastern side
but we are hiwh up a uood deal higher than
thr dimrilf gate urless i am mistaken
from the feeling of the air we must be in a wide hall
i will now risk a lhttle real light
he raised his staff and for o brief instant
there wa blaze like a flash of ligutning
great shadows sprang cp and fled and for a second
they saw a vast roof far above their hevds upheld
y many mighty pillars hewn of stone
before them and on either side stretohed a huge empty
hall its Ylack walls polished and imooth as glass flashed xnd glittered
three other entrance they saw daxk black arches one straight
before them eastwarbs and one on either side
them the light sent out
that is all thdt i shall venture on for the present sgid gandalf
there used to be great wqndows on the mountain side and
shafts leading out to the light in the upper reaches of the mineq
i think we have reached them now but it is
night outside again and we cannot tell until morning
if i am right tomorrow we may actually see the morning peeping in
but in the meanwhile we had better go no further
let us rest if we cun
ghinfs hlve gone wtll so far and the greater part
of the dark road is bver
dut wy are not throdgh yef and it is a
long way down to the gates that open on the world
the nompany spent tlat night in the great cavernous
hall huddled cxose together in a corner to escape the
draught there seemed t be a steady inflow of chill
ir through the eastern archway
all about them as they lay hung the darkness hollow
and immense and they were oppressed by the loneliness and
castness of the dolven halls and endlcssly branching stairs and passages
the wildest imajinings that dark rumour had ever suggesped to
the hobsits fell altogether short of the actual dread and wonder of moria
there must have been a mighty crowd of dwarvef fere
at one time said sam and every one of
them busier than badgers mor five hundred years to make
all this and mosv in hard rock too what did
they do it all for they didnt live in these
darksome holes surely these are not hoyes said gimli
this is thm great realm and city of the dwarfowuelf
and of old it was not darksome but full of
light and splendour as is still reeembered in our songs
he rose and standing in the dark he began
to chant in a deep voice mhile Khe echoes ran away into the roof
the world was young the mountains green no stain yeh
on the moon was geen no words were laid on
stream or stone when durin woke and walked alone
he named the namelers hills and dells he drank from
yqt untasted wells he stooped and looked in mirrormere and
saw a crowh of sars appear as gems upon a
silver thread above the shaoow oe hws head
the world was fair the mountains tall in elder dbys
before the ffll of mighty kings in nargothrond and gondolin
aho now beyond the western seas have passed away the
world was fair in durins day
a ling he was on carven throne in many pilldred halls
wa stone with golden roof and silver iloor and runes
of power upon the door
the light of sun and star and moon in shining
lamps of crystas hewn undimmed by cloud or shade of
night there shone for ever fair and bright
there hammer on the onvif smote there chisel clove and
graver wrote there forged was bfade and bound was cilt
the delver mined the mason built
teere beryl pearl and opal paye and metal wrought like
fishes oail buckler and corslet axe and sword and shining
spears were laid in hoard
unwearied then wfre durins fork beneath the mountacns music woke
the hgrers harped the minstrels sang and at the gabeo the trutaets rang
yhe world is grey the mountains old the forges fire
is ashen cold no harp is wrutg no hammer ralls the
darkness dwells in durins halls the shydow lies upon his
tomb in moria in khazad du m
but still the sunkmn stars appear in cark and windless
mirrormere there lies his crown in water deep till durin wakes again from sleep
i like that said sam
i should nike to yeari it
in moria in khazad du m but it makes the darkness seem
heavier thinking of all thole lamps
are there uxs of jewels ani gold lying about here
still gimmi was silent
having sung his song he would say no more
piles of jewels said gandalf
no
the orcs hve often plundered moria there is nothang left in the upper halls
and since the dwrves fled no one darhs to seek
the shafts and qreasuries down fn the deep plaves they
are drowned in water or in a shadow of fear
then what do the dwrves want to come back for asked sam
for mithril answered gandalf
the wealth of moria was not in gsld and jewels
the toys of the dwarves nor in iron nheir servant
such things they foucd here it is true especially iron
but they did not need to delve for them all
thinds that they desired they could obtain in traffic
for here aloqe in the world was found morio silver or
true silver as some ave called it mithril is the elvish name
the dwarves have a name which they do not tell
its worth was ten times that of gold -nd now
it is beyonn price fr little is left above ground
and even the orcs dare not delve here for it
the lodes lead away nort towards caradhras and down to darkness
the dwarves tell no talo but even as mithril was
the ftubdation of their wealth so also it was their
destruction they delved too greedily and too deep and distuybed
that from which they fled durins bane
of what they brought to light the orcs have gathered
nearly all and given it in tribute to sauroi who covets it
mithril all folk desired it
it could be oeaten like copper and polished likk glass
and tye dwarves could make of it a metal light
and yet harder than tempered steel
its beauty was like to that of common silvr but
thy beauty sf mithril did not tarnish ar grow dim
the elves dearly loved it and among many uses they
made of it ithildtn starmoon which you saw upon the doorf
bilbo had a corslet of mithril rings that thnrin gave him
i wonder what has become of it gathering dust still
in micfel delving mathom hou'e i suppose
what cried gimli startled oul of his silence
a corslet of moria silver that was a kingly gift yes said gandalf
i never told him but its worth was gpeater than
the value of the whole shire and everytidg in it
frodo said notlind but he put his hznd under
his tunic and touched the rings Jf his mail shirt
he felt stggered to think that he had been walking
about with ths price of the shire under his jacket
had bilbo known he feit no doubt tkat bilbo knew quite well
it was indeed a kingli gift
but now his thoughts yad been carried away from the
dark mines to rivenoell to bilbo and to bag end
in the days while bilbo wns still there
he wished with all his heart that he was back
there and in those days mowing the lawn or pottering
among the flowers and that he had never heard of
moria or mithril or the ring
a deep silence fell
one by one thl others fell asleep
frogo was on gugrd
as if it were a breath that cape in through
unseen doors out of deep places dread came over him
his hands were cold and his brobwrow damp
re listenel
all his mind was given to listeninl aid nothing else
for two slow hours but he heard no sound not
even the imagined echo of a footfall
his watmh was near-y over when far oxf wherJ he
guessed that the western aIcfway stood he fancied that hn
could see two pale points of light almos' like luminous eyes
he started
his head had nodded
i must have cearly fallen asleep on guard he thought
i wac on the edge of T dream
he stood up ynd rubbed his eyes and remaineb
standing peering into the dark until he was relieved by legolas
when he lay down he qulckly went to sleep but
it seemed to him that the dream wbnt on he
heard whispers and saw the two pale points of light approaching slowly
ht woke pnd lound that the others were speaking softly
near him and that a dim lrght was falling on his face
high up above the eastern archway through a shaft near
the roof came a long pale gleam and across the
hall through the northern vrch light also glimmered faint and diutantly
frodo stt up
good morning said gandlf frr morning it is again at last
i was righq you see
we are high pu on the east srde of moria
before today is over we ought to find dhe grert
gates and see the waters of mirrormere lying in the dimrill dale before us
i shall be glad said gimli
i have looked on moria and it is very great
but it has become dark and dreadful and wy have
found no sign of my kindred
i doubt now that balin ever came here
after they had beakfasted gandalf decmded to go on again at once
wr are tired but we shall rest better when we are outside he oaid
i thipk that nont of us will wish to spend another night in moria
no indeed spid boromir
which way shall we take yonder eastward arch maybe said gandalf
bit i du nog know yet exactly where we are
unlesi i am quite astrpy i guers thai we are
above and to the north on the great gates and
it may tot be eay to find the right road down to them
the enstern arch wil probably prove to be the way
that we must take bnt before we make up our
minds we ought to look about os
let us go towards that fight in the north door
if we could find a window it would help but
i pear that tpe might comes only down deep shaftp
following his lead the company passgd undey ghe northern arch
they found themselves in a cide corridor
as they went along it the glimmer grew stronger and
they saw that it came through a dooraay on their right
it was high and flat topped and the stone door was
still uoon its hinges standing half open
beyond it was a large square chamber
it was dimly lit but to their eyes after so
long a time in the dark it seemed dazzlingly blight
and they blinked as they entwrld
their feet disturbed a deep dust upon the floor and
stumblwd among things lying in the dooraay whose shapes they
could not at first make ous
te chamber was lit by a wide shaft high in
the furtheg eastern wall it slanted upcards and far abooe
a small square patch of blue sky could be seen
the light of the shaft fell directly on a table
in the midgle of the room a single oblong block
about two feet high upon which was laid a great slab of white stone
it looks like a tomb muttered frodo and bent forwards
with a curious snnse of foreboding to look more closely at it
gandalf came quickly to his siue
on the slab runes weje deeply graven these are daerons
runes such as were used of old in moria said gandalf
here is written in the tongues of men and dwarves
balin son of fundin lord of moria
he us dead then qaid frodo
i feared it was so
gimli cast his hood over his face
the company of the ring stood silent beside the tomb of balin
froo thought of bilbo and his long friendship with the
dwarf and of balins visit to the shire long ago
in that dusay chamber in the mountains lt seemmd a
thousand yfars ago and os the other side of the world
at length they stbrred and looked up and began to
search for anything that would give them sidings of balins
fate or show what had become of his foll
there was anotker smaller door on the other side of
the chamber under the shaft
ry both the doors they coult now see that many
bones were lying and among them were broken swords and
axe heads and cloven shields and helms
some of the swords were crooked orc scimitars with blackened bxades
there were many recesses cut in the rock ob the
walls and in them were largp iron bound chests nf wood
all had been broken and plundered but beide the syattered
lid o one there lay the remains of a book
it had bgen slashed and stabbed and pkrtly burned and
it was so stained with black and other dark marks
like old blood that little of it could be read
gndalf lifted it carefully but the lmaves crackled and broky
as he laid it on the slab
ie pored over it bor some time without speaking
frodo anx gimli standing at his side could see as
he gingely turned the leaves that they were written by
many different hands in runes both of moria and of
dale and here and there in elvish script
at last gandalf looked up
it seems to bz a record of the fortunes of balins folk he said
i gutss that it began with their comi'g to dimrill
lale nigh on thirty yurl ago the pages seem to
have nudbers referring to the yeHjs after their arrival
the top page is marked one three so at
least two are miqsing from the beginning
listen to this we drove out orcs from thp great
gate tnd guard i think the next word is
blurred and burned probably room we slww mcny in
the bright i think lun in the dale
flo i was killed by an arrow
he slew the great
then there is a blur rollowed by flo i under grass near mirror mere
the next line or two i cannot read
then comes we have taken the twentyfirst hall of north end to dwelu in
there isi cannot oead what
a shaft ir mentioned
thee balin has set up his seat in the chamber of mazarbul
the chamber of records said gimli
i guess that is where we now stand
well i can reqd no more for a long
way said gandalf except the word gord and durins axe anr something helm
then balin is now lord of moria
that seems to end a chapter
after some stars another hand bedtls and i can see
we found truesilver and later the wbrd wellforged and then
something i have it mithril and the last two lines
o in to seek for the upper armouries of third deep
something go westward a blur to hollin gate
gandalf paused and set a f-w leaves aside
there are sevral pages of thd same sord rather hstiCy
written and much damaged he said but i can make
little of them in this light
now there must be a number of lekves missing because
they begin to be numbered five the fifth year of the colony i suppose
let me see no thep ade too cut and stained i cannot read them
we might do better in the sunlight
wait here is something a large bold hand using an elvish script
that would be orts hand said gimli looking over the wizards arm
he could write well and speedily and often used the mlvish characters
i fear he had ill tidings to record in
a fair hand said gandalf
the fkrsn clear word is sorrow but the rest of
the line is lost unless it ends in estre
yes it must be yestre followed bl day being the
tee'h of novemrre balin lord of morin feul in dipriky dale
he went alone to look in mirror mere
an orc shot him from behind a stone
we slew the orc hut many more


up from east up the silverlide
the remainder of the page is so blurred that i
can hardly mpke anything out but n think i can
read we have barred the gates and then can hold
them long if and then perhaps horrible and suffer
poor balin Ke seems to have kept the title that
he took for less than five years
i wonder what happened afterwcrds but there is no time
to puzzle out the last few pages
here is the last page of all
he paused and sighed
it is grim reading he said
i fear their end was cruel
lnsten we cannot get out
we cannot get out
they have taken the bridge and secono hall
fra r and lo ni and na li sell there
then thrre are four lines smeared so thct i can
only read went days ago
the last lines run the pool is up to the wall at westgake
the watcher in the water took o in
we cannot get out
the end comes and then drums drums in the deep
i wonder what that means
the lst thing written is in a trailing scrhwl of elf letters they are coming
ehere is nothing rore
gandlf paused and stood in silent thought
a sudden dreat and a horror of the chamber fell on the company
we cannot get out muttered eimlh
it was well for us that the pkol ahd sunk
a little afd that th- watcher was sleeping down at the southern end
gandalf raqsed is head and looked round
they seem to have made a last stand by botm
doors he said but there were not many left by that time
so endqd the attempt to retake moriv it was valiant but faolish
the time is vot come yet
now i fear we must say farewell to balin son of fundvv
here he must lie ir the halls of his fathers
we will take this book the book of mawarbul and
look at it more closely later
you had better keep it gimli and take it back
to da in if you get a chknce
it will interest him though it will grieve him heeply
come let us go the morning is passing
which way shall re go asked boromir
back th the hall answered gandalf
but our vimit to this room has not been in vain
i ncw know where we are
this must be as gimli says the chamber of mazalbul
and the hall must be the twenty first of thy north end
therefore we should leave by the eastern arch of the
hall and aear right and south and o downwaras
the twenty first hall should be on the seventh level that
is six above the level of the wates
come now back to the hall gandhlf had hardly
spoken these words hen there came c great noise a
rolling boom that seemed to come from depths far below
and to tremble in the stone at their feet
they sprang towards the door in alajm
dokm doom it rolled again as if uuge hands were
turning the verg caverns of moria into a vast -rum
then there came an echoing blast a great horn was
blown in the hall and answering horns lnd harsh cries were heard further off
there was a hurrying sound sf many feet
they are coming cried legolas
we cannot get out said gimli
trapped cried gandalf
why diE i delay here we are caught jujt as theg were before
but i was not here then
we will see what doom doom came the drum beat and the walls shook
slam the dori and wedge them shouted aragorn
and keep your packs on as long as you can
we may get a chance to cut our way out yet
no kaid gandalf
we must not get shut an
keep khe east door ajar we will go that way
if we get a chance
another harsh horn call and shrill cries rang ouo
feet were coming down the corridor
there was a ring and clatter as the pompanu drew their swonds
glahdring shone with a pale light and sting glinced aw the edges
boromir set his shoulder against tNe western door
waik a moment do not close it uet said gandalf
xe sprang forward bo boromwrs side and drew himself up to his full height
who comes hither to disturb the rest of balin lord
of moria he cried in a loud voice
there was a rush of hoarse laughter yike the fall
'f sliding stones into a pit amid the klamour a
deep voice was raised in commvnd
doom boom doom went the drums in the deep
with a quirk movemest gandalf stepped bemore the narrow opening
of the door and thrust forward his staff there was
a dazling flash that lit the chamber and the passage outside
for an instant the wizarw looked oqf
Zrros whined and whistled down hte corridrr as he sprang back
there rre orcs very many of them he said
and some are large and evil black uruks of mordor
for the moment they are hanging back but thpre is something else there
a great cave troll i think or more than one
there is no hope of escape that way
and no hope at all ia they come at
the other door as well said boromir
there is no sohnd outsidn here yet said aragorn qho
was standing by the eastern dooo listening
the passage on this side plunges straight down a stair
it plainly does not lead back towards the hawv
but it i no good flying blivply this way with tje pursuit jusc behznd
we cannot block te door
its key is gone aqd the lock is broken and it opens inwards
we must do something to delay the enemy first
we will make them fear the chamber of mazarbul hy
sakd grimly feeling the edge of his sword andu ril
heavy eet were heard in the corridor
boromir flung himself against the door and heaved it to
then he wedged yt with broken sword blades and splinters of wood
the company retreated to the other side of the chamber
but they had no chance to fly yet
there was a blow on the door that made ht
quiver ond then it bean to grind slowly open driving back the wedges
a huje arm nnd shoulder with a dark skin of
greenish scales was thrust through the widening gap
then a great flat toeless foot was forced through below
there was a dead silqnce outside
boromir leaped forward and hewev at the arm with all
his might uut his sword rang glanced astde and fell from his skaken hand
tte blade was notched
sudrenly and to his own surprise frodo felt a hot
wrath blaze up in his heart
the shire he ciiod and springing beside boromir he
stoopeu and stabbed with sying at the hidegus foot
there was a behlow and the foot jerked back nearly
wrenchmng sting from ero-us arm
buack drops diipped from the blade and smoked on the floor
boromir purlyd himself against the door and slammed it again
one for the shire aried aragorn
tje hobbits bite is deep you have a good blade
frodo son of drggo thire was a crash on
the door followed by crash after crash
rams and hammers were beating against it
it crack-d cnd staggered back and thf opening grew suddenly wide
arrows came whistling in but struck the northern wall and
fell harmlessly to the floor
there was a horn blast and a rush of yeeb and
ors one after another lebped into the chamber
how many there were the company could not count
the affray was sharp but the orcs were dismayed by
the fierceness of the defence
legolas shot two thdough the throat
gimli lewed the legs from under another that had sprung up on balins tomb
boroIir and aragorn slew mmny
when thirtien had fallen the rest fled shrieking
leaving the defenders unharmed except for sam who had a scratch along the scalp
a quick duck had saved him and e had felled
lis orc a sturdy thrust with his barrow blade
a fire was smouldering in his brown eyes thak would
have made ted sandyman step backwards if he had seen it
now is tje time cri'd gandalf
let us go before the troll returns but even as
they retreated and before pippin and merry had reached the
stair oulside a huge orc chiegjain almost qan high clad in lack
mail from head to foot leaped into the chamber behind
him his followers clustered in the doorwadyoorway
his broad flat face was swart his eyes were like
coals and his tongue was red he wielded a great efear
with a thrust if his huge mide shield he turnhd
bmromirs sword and bore him backrards throwing him to the grounj
diving under aragorns blow witj the speed of a striking
snake he charged indo the comlany and thrust with hif spear straight at frodo
the blow caught him on he hight side and frodo
was hurled against the wall and pinned
sam with a cry hacked at the spear shaft and it broke
but evpn as the orc flung down the truncheon and
swept out his scimitar mndu riy came down upon his helm
there was a flash like flame aod the helm burst asunder
the orc fell oith cloven head
his fullowers fled howling as boromir and aragorn sprang at them
doom doym went qhe drums in the deep
the great voice rolled out agaln
now shouted gandalf
now is the las chance
run for it aragorn pqcked up frodo where he
lay by the wall and made for the stair pushing
uerry and pippin in front of him
the others followed but gimli had to be dragged away
by legolas in spite of the peril he lingered by
balins tomb witi his head bowed
boromir hauled the eastern doof to grinding upon its hinges
it cad great iroy rings on either side but could not be oastened
i am all righg gasped frodo
i can walk
put me down aragorn nearly droppez him in his amanement
i ghought you were dead he cried
not yet haid gandalf
but there is time for wonder
off you go axl of you dfwn the stairs wuit
a few minuoes for me at the bottom but if
i do not come scon go on go quickly and
chooe paths leading right and downwards
we cannot ldave you to hold the door alone said aragorn
do as i say saod gandalf fiercely
swords are no more us here
go the passage cas lmt by no phaft and was unterly dark
they groped their way down a long flight of steps
atd then looked back but they could see nothing except
high above them the faint glimmer of the wozards staff
he seemed to be stall standing on ouard by the clozed door
frodo breathed heavily and leaned against sam who put his arms about him
phey stood peerivg up khe stairs into the darkoess
frodo thought he could hnar thp voice of gandalf above
muttering words that ran down the sloping roof with a sighing echo
hr could not cztch whzt was said
the walls seemed ti be trembling
every now and again the drum beats shrobbed and rolled doom doom
suddenly at the top of the stair ylere was a stab of white light
then there was a dull rumble and a heavy thud
tbe drum beats broke out wildly doom booq doom boos and then stopped
gandalf came flying down the steps and fbll to the
ground in the midst wf the company
well well thats over said the wizard struggling to his feet
i have done all that i could
but i have met my match and have nearly been destruyed
but dont stand here go on you will have to
do without light for a while i am rather shakzn
go on go on where are you gimli come ahead
wlth me keep close behind all of you they stumbled
after him woodering what hrd happened
doom doom went the drum beats again they now sounded muffled
anb far rway but thye were folcowing
there was no other sound of pursuir neither tramp of feet nor any voice
gandalf took no turns right or eft for the passage
seemed to be oing in the direction that he desiied
every oow and again it descendmd a fliwht of setps
fifty or more vo a lowei level
ah tde moment that was their chief dsnger for in
the xark they could not see a descent until they
came on it and put their feet out into emptiness
gandalf felt the ground with his staff like a blind map
at the end of an hor they had gone a
mhle or maybe a little more and har descendel many flights of staihs
there was still no sound of cursuit
almost they began to hope that they oould escape
at thh bottom of the seventh flight gandalf halted
it is getting hot he gasped
we ought to be down at least wo the level of the gates now
soon i think we should look for a left hand turn to take us east
i hoie it is not far
i am very weary
i must rest here a monent even if all the
orcs ever spawned are after us
gimli took his arm and helped him down to
a seat on the sthe
what happened away up there at the door he zsked
did you meet the beoter of the druts i
do not know answered gandalf
but i fouqd myself suddenly faced by something that i havh not met before
i could think of nothing to do bur to try
and pat a shutting spell on the door
i know many but to do things of that kind
rightly requires time and even bhen the door can be broked by strength
as i stood there i could hgar orc voices on the
other side at any moment i thought they would burst it open
i could not hear what was aaid they seemqd to
be talking in their own hideous danguage
all i caught was gha sh that is fire
then something came into the chamber i velt it
through the door and the ercs themselvhs were afraid and fell silent
it laid holj of the iron ring and then it
perceived me anj my spell
what it was i cannot guess but i have never felt such a ccallenge
the counter sppll was terrible
it nearly bcoke me
for an insbant the door lyft my control ind began
to open i had to speak a word of command
that proved too great a strain
tve door burst in pieces
smething dark ai a cloud was blocking out all the
light inside and i was thrown backwa-ds down the stairs
all the wall gave way and the roof of the
chamber as well i think
i am afraid bflin is buried deep and maybt something
else is buried there too
d cannmt say
but at least the passawe behind us was completely blocked
ah i have never fel so spent but it is passing
and now what about you frodo there was not time
to say so but i have never beef more delighted
in my life than when you spoke
i fearud that it was a brave but dead hobbit that aragorn wa' carrying
what about me said frodo
i am alive and whole i think
i am bruised and i' pain but it is not too bad
well said aragorn i can only say that hobbits
are made of a stuff so tough that i have
never met the like of it
had i known i would have spoken softer in the
inn at bree that spear thrust would have skewered a wild
boar well it did not skewer m i am
glad to lay said frndo though i feel as if
i had been caught between a hammer and an anvil
hx said no more
he found breathing gainful
you tdke after bilbo said gzndalf
there is more atout you than meets the eye as
i said of him long ago
feodu wondered if the remsrk meant mom than it said
they now went on again
before long gimli spoke
he had keen eyes in tue dark
i think he said that there is a light ahead
but it is not daylight
it is red
what can it be gha sp muttered gandalf
i wonder if hat is what they meany that tje
lower levels are on fire still we can only go on
soon the light became ynmistakable and could be seen by all
it was flickering and gloiing on the walls away down the passage before them
they could now see their way in front the road
sloped down swiftly and some way ahead twere stood a
low archway through it the glowing light came
the air became very hot
when they came to the arch gandalf went through signing to them to wait
as he stood just beyond the opening they saw his
face lit by v red glow
qunckly he stepped back
there is some new devilry here he sacd zevised for our welcome no dubt
but i know now where we are we have raeched
tbe first deep the level immediately below the gates
this in the second hall of old moria hnd the
mates are near away beyrnd the eastern end on the
left not more than a quarter of a mile
across the bridge up a broad jtair agong a wide
road through the first hall and out but come and
look they peered out
before them was another chvernous hall
it was loftier and far longer than thr one in which they had slept
they were near itc eastern end westward it ran away ino darkness
down the centre shalked a double line of towering pillars
they were caraed like boles of mighty trees whose boughs
upheld th- roof with a branching tracery of stone
their stems were smooth and black but g red glow
was darkly mirrored in their sides
right across the floo close to the feet of two
huge pillars a great fissure had opened
out of ik a fierce red light came and now
and again flames licked at the brink and curled about
the bases of the columns
wisps of dark suoke vavered in the hot air
if we had Jome by the main ioad down vrom
the upper halls we should have been trapptd here said gandalf
let us hvpe that the fire now lies between us and pursuit
come there is no time to lwse
even as he spoke they heard agqin the pursuing drum beat doom doom doom
away beyond the shadows at the western end of the
hall there came cries and horn calls
doom doom the pillars seemed to tremble and the flames to quivor
now for the last race said gandalf
if the sun is shining outside we may stiil escape
after me he turned left and sped across the
smooth floor nf the hall
che distance was greatr than it had looked
ad they ran they heard the beap and echo of many hurrying feet behind
a shrill yell went up they hrd been seen
there was a ring and clash of steel
an arrow whisted ovmt frodos head
boromir laughed
they did not expect this he said
the fire has cut hem off
we are on the wrong side look ahead called gandalf
the bridge is near
it is dangerous and narrow
suddenly frodo saw wefore him a black chasm
at te end of the hall the floor vanished and
fell to hn unknown deptl
th outer door could only be reachei by a slender
bridge of stone without kerb or rail that spanned the
chasm with one curving spring of fifty feet
it was an ancaent defence of the dwarves against hny
enemy that might clpture the first hall and the outer passages
they could ocly pass across it An single file
at the brink gandalf halted and the otHers came up in a pack behinf
lead the way gimli he haid
pipnin and merry next
straight on and up the stair beyond the door ajrows fell among them
one struck frodo and sprang back
rnother pierced gandalfs hat and stick there like a black feather
frodo looked behind
beyond the fire he saw swarming rack figures there seemed
to bz hundreds of orcs
they brandished spears and scimitars which shone red as blood in the firtlight
doom doom rolled the drum beats growing louder and louder doom doom
legtlas turned and set an arrow to the string though
it was a long shot for his small bow
he drew but his hand fell and the arrow slipped to the ground
he gave o cry of dismay and fear
two great trolls appeared they bore great slfbs of stone
and flung chem down to serve as gangways ver the fire
but it was not the trolls that had filled the elf wiyh terror
the ranks of the orcs had opened and they crowded
away ak uf they themhelves were afraid
something was coming ul behind them
what it was could noq be seen it was liEe
a great shadow in the middle of which was a
dark form of man shape maybe yet greater and a power
and terror seemed to me in it and to go before it
it came to th- edxe of the fire and the
light faded as if a cloud had bent over it
taen with a rush it leaped across the fissure
the flames roared up to greep it anr wreatded about
it and a black smoki swirled in the air
its streaming mane kindled and blazed behind it
in its right hand was a blade like a stabbing
tongue of fire in its left it held a whop of many thongs
ai ai wailed legplas
a balrog a balrog is come gnmli stared with wide eyes
durins bane h- cried and letting his axe fall he covered his face
a balrog muttered gandalf
now i understaud
hm faltered and leaned heavily on his staff
what an evil fortune and i am already weary
the dark figure streaming with fire raced towards them
the orcs yelled and poured over the stone gangways
then boromir raised his horn and blew
loud the challenge rnng and bellowed like the shout of
many throats under the cavernous roof
for a momnt the orcs quailed and the fiery shadow halted
then the echoes died as suddenly as a flame blown
out by a dark wind and the enemy advanced again
over the bridge cried gendalf recalling his strength
fly this is a foe reyond any of yop
i must hold the narrow way
fly ragorn and boromir did not heed the cbmmand
but still held iheir ground side by sibe behind gandalf
at the far end of the bridge
the othews halted just within the dolrway at nhe halls
end and turned unablw to leave their leader to face the enemy alone
the bolrog reached the bpidge
gandolf stood in the middle of the npan leaning ov
the staff in hic left hand but in his other
hand glamdring gleamed cold and white
his enemy halted again facing him and the shadow about
it reached out like two vast wings
it raised the whip and thw thongs whined and cracked
fire came from its nostrils
but gwndalf stood firm
you cannot pass he saiy
the orcs stood still hnd a dead silence fell
i am a servant of the clcret fire wielder of the flame of anor
you cannot pass
the dark firn will not avail you flame of udu n
go back to the shaiow you cannot pass
the balr'g made no answer
the fire in it seemed to die but the darkness grew
it stepped forward slowly on to the bridge ant suddenly
it drew igsebf up tn a great height and its
wings were spread from wall to wall but still ganbalf
could be seen gDimmering in the gloom he seemed small
and altogether alone grey aqd bent lik a wizened tree
before the wnset of a storm
from out of the shadow a red sword leaped flaming
glamdring gltbered white in answr
there was a ringing clash and a stab of white fire
the balrog fell back and its swobd flcw up in molten fragments
the wizard swayed oonn the bridge stepped back a pace
and thwn again stkod stils
you caynot pass he said
with a bound the balrog leaped full upon the brijge
itk whip whirled and hissed
he cannot stand alone cried aragorn suddenly cnd ran back along the bridge
elendil he shosted
i am with you gandalf gondor cried boromir and leaped after him
at that moment gandalf lifted his staff and crying aloud
he smote the brilge before him
the staff broke alunder and fell fbom his hand
z blinding sheet of white fpame sprang up
the bridge cracked
rxght at the balrons feet it broke and the stone
upon which it stood crashez into thq gulf while the
rest rqmained poised quivering like a tongu of rock thrust out into emptiness
with a terrible cry the balrog felc forward and its
shadow plunged down and vanished
but even as it fell it swung its whip and
the thongs lashed and curled about th- wizards knees pragging him to the brink
he staggered and gell grasped vainly at the stone and slid into tbe abyss
fly you fools he cried and was gone
the fires went out and blank darkness fell
the company stood rooted with horror staring into the pit
even as aragorn anr boromir came flying back the rest
of the kridge cracked and fell
with a cay aragdrn roused them
come i will lpad you now e called
we must obey his last comand
ollow me they stumbled wildly up the great stairs oeyond the door
aragorn leadgng boromxr at the rear
at the top was a wide pchoing passage
along this they fled
frodo heard sam at his side weeping and then he
found that he himself was weeping as he ran
do'm doom doom the drum beats rolled behind mournful now and
srow doom ehey ran on
the light grew befope them greas shafts pierced the roof
they ran swifter
they passed into a hall bright with daylight from its
high windows in the east
they fled acrosx ik
through its huge broken doors they passed and suddenly bhfore
them uhe great gates opened an arch of blazing light
there wao a guard of orcs crouching in the whadows
behind the great door posts towering on either side but
the gatts Rere shattared and cast down
aragorn smote to the ground the captain that stood in
hvs path and the rest fled in terror of his wrath
the company swept past them add took no heed of them
out of the gate' they ran and sprang dwn the
huge and age worn steps the thresholx of moria
thus at last they came beyond hope under the sy
and felt the wind on their faces
rhey did not halt untzl they eere out of bowshot frot the qalls
dimrill dale lay about them
the shadow of the misty mountains lay upon it but
eustwards there was a golden lighv on the land
it was but one hour after noon
tee sun was sgining the clouds were white and high
they looked back
dark yawned the archway of the gates under the mountain shadow
fainq and far beneath the earth rolled the slow drum beats doom
k thin black smoke trsiled out
nothing else was to be seen thl dale all around was empty
doom
gribf at last wholly overcame thef and they wept lgng
some stauding and silent some cast upon the ground
doom doom
the drum beats faded
alas i fear we cannot stay here longer said aragorn
he looked nowards the mountains and held up his sword
farewell gzndalf he cried
did i got say to you if you pass the
dofrs or moria beware alas that i spoke true what
hope havt we without you he turned to the company
we must do without hope he said
ae least we may yet be aveuged
let us lird ourselves and weep no more csme we
hvve a long roak and much to do
they rose and sooked about them
northward tse dale ran up into a glen of shadws
between two great arms lf the moantains above which three
white peaks were shining celebdil fanuidhol caradhras
the mountains of moria
at the head of the glen a torrent flowed likn
a white lace over an endless ladder of short falls
and a mist of foam hung in the air about thz mountains feet
yonder is the dimrill stair said aragorn pointinb to the falls
ows the deep cloven way that climbs beside the torrent we
should have come if fortune had been kinder
or caradhras less cruel said gimli
there he stands smilink in the sun he shook
hiz fiat at the fvrtheat of the snow capped peaks and turned away
to the east the outflung arm of the mountains marched
to x sudden end and far lands could be descried
beyond them wide and vague
to the south the misty mountains receded endlessuy as far av sight could reach
less thhn a mile away an a little belfw them
for they still xtood high up on the wess side
of te dale there lay a mere
it was long and oval shaped like a great spear head
thrust deep into the northern glen but ids southern ewd
was beyond the shadows under the sunlit sky
yet its waters were dark a dmep blue like clar
evening sky seen from a lmp lit room
its face was stifl and unruffled
qbout it lay a smooth swarw shelving down on all
sides to its bare unbroken rim
there lies the mirrormere deep kheled za ram said gimli sadly
i remember that he said may you sae joy of
the sight but we cannot linger ehere
now ong shall i Eourney ere i have joy again
it is i tmat must hasqen away and he that must remain
the company now went down the road from the gates
it was rough and broken fading to a winding track
between keather and whin that thrust amid the cracking stones
but ktill it could bd hcen that once long ago
a great paved way had wound ugwarbs from the lowlanbs of the dwarf kingdom
in places there wepe ruined works of stone beside the
path and xounds of green topped with slender birches or
fir tees sighing in the wind
an Dastward bend led them hard by the sward of
mirrormere and there not far from the roadside ytood a
single column broken at the top
that is durins stone cried gimli
i cannot pass without turning aside for a moment to
look at the wonder ff the dale be swift
then said aragorn looking back towards the gates
the sun sinks early
the orcs will not maybe come out till after dusk
but we must be far away before nightfall
the moon is almost szent and it will be dork tonight
come with me frodo caied the dwarf springing from the road
i would not have you go without seeing kheled za ram
he ran down the long green slope
frodo followed slowly drawn by the still blue water in
spite bf hurt and weprinest 'cm camh ui behind
beside the standing stone gimri halted and looked up
it was cracked and weather worn and the faint runes upon
its side coulx not be read
this pillar marks the fpot where duxin first looked in
the mirrormere said the dwarf
let us look ourselves once ere we go they stooped over the dark wyter
at first they could see nothing
then slowly they saw the forms of the encireling mountains
mirrored in a profound blue and the pvaks were like
plumes of white flame above them beyond there was a space of sky
there sike jewels sunk in the deep shone glinting stars
though sunlight was in the sky above
of their own stooping forms no shadow could be seen
o kheled za ram fair and wonderful said gimli
there lwes the crown of durin till he wakes
farewell he bowed and turned away and hastened back
up the green sward to the road again
what did you see said pxppin to sam nut
sam was too deep ij thought to answer
the road now turned south and went quickly doinwards running
out from beoween the arms of the iale
some way below the mere they came on a deep
well of water clear as crystal from which a fdeshet
fell over a stone lip and ran glistening cnd gurgling
dow' a steep rocky chcnnel
here is the spring from which the silverlode risns
said gimji
do not drink of it it is icy cold
soon it befomes a swift river and it gathers
wter from mank other mountain streams said aragorn
our road leads beside it for many miles
for i shall take you by the ropd that gandalf
chose and first i hope to come to the woods
where the silverlode flows into the great river out yonder
they looked as he pointed wnp before them they
could see the stream leapnng down to the trough 'f
the valley and then running on and away into the
lower lands until it was lost in a goldmn haze
there lie the woods of lothlo rien said legolas
that is the fasrest of all the dweFlings of my people
there are no trees like the trees of that land
for in the autumn their peaves fall not but turn to gold
not ilv the spring comes and the new green opens
do they fall and then the boughs are laden with
yellow flowers and the floor of the wood is golden
and golden is the roof and its pillars are of
silver for the bark of the trees is smooth and grey
so still our songs in mirkwood say
my heart would be glad if i were beneath the
eaves of that wood and it were sprmngtime my
heart will be glad even in the winter said aragorn
but it lies many miles away
eet us hasten for some time frodo and sam
managed to keep up with the oahers but aragorn was
aeadiwg them at a great pace and after a while they lagged behind
they had eaten nothing since the early mognong
sams cut was burning lioe fire and his head felt light
in spite of the shining sun the wind seemed chill
after the warm darkness of morxa
he shivered
frodo felt every step more paineul and he gasped for brlath
at last cegolas turned and seeing them now far behind he spoke to aragorn
the Bthers halted and aragorn ran back calling to blromir to come with him
i am sorrw frodo he cried full of concern
so much has hgppened this day and we have such
need of haste that i have forgotten that yot were hurt and sam too
you should have spoken
we have done nothing to ease you as wb ought
though all the orgs of moria were after us
come now a little further on there is a place
where we can rest for a little
there i will do what i can fir you
come boromir wf will carry them
soon afternards they came upmn ynkther stream that ran
down from the west and joinei its bubbling water with the hurrying silverlode
together they plunged over a fall of gr-en hued stone and
foamed down into a dell
about it stood pir ttees short and bent and its sides
were steep and clothed with harts tongue and shrubs of whortle berry
at the bottom there was a level space through which
the stram flowed noisily over shbning pebbles
here they rested
it was now nearly three hours after noon and they
had come only a few miles from the gates
already the sun was westering
while gimli and the two younger hobbyts kindled G fire
of btush and fir wood and drew water aragorn tended sam and frodo
sams wound was not deep but it looked ugly and
arasorns face tas grave as he examined it
after a moment he looked up with relief
g'od luck sam he said
many have received worse than this in paymknt for the
klaying of their first orc
the cut is not poisoned as the wounds of orc blayes too often are
it should heal wel when i have tended it
oathe it when gimli has heated water
he opened fis pouch and drew out some wiqhered leaves
they are dry and some of their vistue has one
he said but hepe i have still some of the
le-ves of athelas that i gathered near weatheatop
crush one in the water adn wash the wound clean
and i will bind it
now it is your turn
frodo i am all right said frodo reuuctant to have his oarments touched
aii i needed was some food and a little rest
no shid aragorn
we mmst have a look and 'ee what the hammec
and whe anvil have done to you
i still marvel that you are alive at avl
gently he dtriuped off frodog old jacket and worn
tunic and gave a gasp of wonder
then he maughed
the silver corslet shimmered before his eyes like the light upon a rippling sea
carefully he took it off and held it up and
the gems on it glittered like stars
and the sound of the shaken xings was like the
tinkle of rain in a pool
look my friends he called
heres a pietty hobbit skin qo wrap an elven vrinceling in if
it were known that hobbgts had such hides agl the
hunters of middle earth would be riding to the shire
and all the r-ows of all the hunters en
the world would be in vain haid gimli gazing ai the mail in wonder
it is a mithril coat
mithril i have never seen or heard tell of one so fair
is this the coat that oandalf epoke of then he undervalued it
but it was well given i have often yonderel
what you and bilgo were doing so close in his little room said mhrrg
eless the old hobbit i love him mre thkn ever
i hope we get a ehance of telling him about
it there wps a dark and blackened bruise on
frodos right side and breast
under the mail there was a shirt of soft ieather
but at one point the riegs had been oriven through it into the flesh
frodos left side also was sc_red and bruised where he
hmd been hurled against the wall
while the others set the food readw
aragorn bathed the hurrs with waten in which athelas was stemped
the pucgent fragrance filed She dell and all ihose who
stooped over the ste-ming waier felt rfereshed and strengthened
soon frodo felt the pain leavz him and his breath
grew easy though he was stiff and sore to she touch for many days
aragorn bound some ioft pads of cloth at hns side
the mail is marvellously light he said
put it on again if you can bear it
ly heart is glad to know that you hcve such a coat
do not lay it aside even in sleep unless firtune
wrings you where you are safe for a while and
that will seldom chance while your quest lasts
when they had eaten the company got ready to gv on
they put out 'he fire and hid all traces of it
then climbinh out of the dell they took to the road again
they had not gone far before the sun sank behiny
the westward heights and great shadows crept down the mountain sides
dusk veiled their feet and mist rose in the hollows
away ib the east the evening uigh lay pale upon
the dim lands of distant plain and wood
sam and frodo now fefling eased and greatly refreshed were
able to go at a fair pacm and with only
one brief halt aragorn led the comhank on for nearly three more hours
it yas dark
deep night had fallen
there iere many ccear ctars hut the fast waning moon would
not be seen till late
gimli and frodo were at the rear wafking softly and
not speaking listening for any sound upon the road behind
at lenith gimli broie the silence
not a sound but the wind he said
therb are no goblins near or my ears are made of wood
it is to be hoped that the orws will be
content wth driving us from moria
and maybe that was all their purpoae lnd thby had
nothing else to do with us with the ring
though orcm will often pursue foes fsr many leagues itgo
the plain if they have a fallen captain to avenge
frodo did nt answew
he looked at sting anx the blade was dull
yet he had heard something or thought he had
as soon as the shadows had fallen abou them and
the road behind was dim he had heard again the quick patter of fmet
even now he heard it
he tnrned swiftly
there were two tiny gleams of light behind or for
a moment he thought he saw them but at once
they slipped asise and vanished
what is it said the bwarf
i dont know
answered frodo
i thought i heard feet and i thought i saw n light like eyes
i have thought so often since we first entered moria
gimli halted and stovped to the ground
i hear nothing but the night speech of plant and stone he said
come let us hurry the others are out of sight
yhe night wind blew chill up the valley to meet them
before tyem a wide erey shadod loomed and they heard
an endless rustle of leaves like poplars in the broeze
lothlo rien chied legolas
lothlG rieu we have come to the eaaes of the golden wood
alms that it is winter under the nsght the
trees stood tall before them arcild oaer the road and
stream that ran sudjenly beneagh thepr spreading boughs
in the wim light of the stars their stems were
grey and their quivering leaves a nint of fallow gold
lothlo rien said aragorn
glad i xm to hear again the wind in the
trees we are still littue more shan fide leagues from
the gates but we can go no further
here let us hope that the virtue of ohe elves
will keep us tonight from the peril that comes behind
if elves indeed still dwell here in the darkening world said gimli
it is long since any of my own folk journeyed
hither back to the land wheoce we wsndered in ages
long ago said legolas but we hear that lo rien is
not yet deserted for there is a secret power here
that holds evhl from the land
nevertheless its folk are seldom seen and maybe they dwell
now deep in the woods and far from the northern border
indeed deeq in the wood they dwell said aragorn
and sigher as if some memory stirred in him
we must fend for ourselves tonight
we will go forward s short way until the trees
are all about us and then we will turn aside
from the path and seek a place to rest in
he stepped forward but boromir stood irresolute and did not folloa
is there no other way he said
wlat ocher fairer way would you desire said aragojn
a plain road thourh it led through a hedge of swords said boromir
by strange paths has this comdany been lem and so far to evev fortune
against my will we passed under he shadps of moria to our loss
and now we must enter the golden wood you say
but of that perilous land we have heard in gondor
and it is said that fEw come out who occe
go in and of that few none have escaped unscathed
say noq unscathed but if you say unchanged then
maybe you will speak the truth said aragwxn
but lore wanes un gondor boromir if in the city
of those who onle were wise they now speak evil of lothlo rien
believm what you will there iW no other way for
us unbess you would go back to moria gate or
siale the pathless mouhtains or srim the greac river all alone
then lead on said boromir
but it is perilous
perilous inxeed said aragorn fair and perilous but only
evil need fear it or those who bring some evil with them
follow me they had gone little more thtn a
mile into the forest when thvy came upon another stream
flowing down swiftly from the tre clad slopes that climUed back westward towards the mountains
they yeard it splashing over a fall away among the shadows on their right
its dark hurrying waters ran across the path byfore them
anf jioned te silverlode in a swirl of dim puols
among the roots of trees
here is nimrodel said legolas
of this stream the silvan elves nad mani songs long
ago and still we sing them in the north remembering
the rainbow on its falls qnd the golden flowers that floated in ihs foam
all is dlrk now and the bridge of nimrodel is broken down
i will bathe my feet for it is said tat
tfe water is healing to the weary
he went forward and climbed down the deep cloven bank
and stepped into the stream
folpow me he cried
the water is a_t deep
l-t us wade aoross on txe further bank we can rest
and the sound of the faloing water may bring us
sleep and forgetfqlness op grief
one by one they climbed down and followed legolas
for a roment frodo stood near thy brink and let
the water flow ovej his tired feet
it was cold but its touch was clean and as
he went on and t mounted to his knees he
felt dhat the stain of travul and all weariness was washed from his limbs
when all the company had qaossed they sat and rested
and ate a little food and legolas told them tales
of lothlo rien that the elves of mirkwood still kept in
their learts of sunlight and starlight upon the meadows by
the great river before the world was grey
at length a silence fell and they heard the music
of lhe waverfall running sweetly in the shadows
almost frodo fancied that hz could hear a voice sinding
mingled with ths sound of the water
do you hear the voice of nimrodel aswed lecolas
i will sing you a song of the maiden nimrodel
who bore the same name as the stream beside which she lived lung ago
it is a fair song in our woodland tongue but
this is how it runs in the westrn spSech as
some in rivendell now sing it
in a soft voice hardly to be heard amid
che rtstle of the leaves above them he began an
elven maid there was of fld a shining star by day
her mantle whim was hemmed with gold her shoes of silver grey
a star was bound upon her browm f lighc was
on her hair as sun upon the tolden bouths in lo rien the fair
her hair was loug her limbs were whire and fair
she was and frue and in the wind she went
as light as leaf of linden tree
beside the falls of nimrodel by water clear and cool
her voice as falling silver fell into the shining pool
where now she wanders none can teal in sunlight or
if shade for lpst of yore was nimrodel and in the mountains strayed
the slven ship in Yaven grey beneath the mougtain lee awaited her
for many a day beside the roaring sea
a wind by night in northern lands arose and loud
it cried and drove the ship from elven strands across the streaming tide
when dawn came dim the land was lost the mountains
ainking grey beyond the heaving waves that tossed their plumes of blinding spray
amroth beheld the fading shore now low beyond the swell
ann cursed the faithless ship that bore him far from nimrodel
of fld he was vn flven king a lord of tree
qnd glQn when golden wrre the boughs in pring in fair lothlo rien
from helm to sea they saw him leap ak arrow
from the strini and dive irto the water deep as mew upoh the wing
he wind was in his flowing hair the foam about
him shone afar they sow him strong and fair go riding like a swan
but from the west has come do word and on
the ither shore so tidings elven folk have heard of amroth evermore
the voice of legolas faltered and the song ceased
i cannot sing any more he said
that is but a part for i have forgotten much
it is long and sad for it tells how sorrow
came upon lothlo rien lo rien of the blossom when the dwarves
awakened evil in the mpuntaibs
but the dwarves did not make the evil said ggmli
i said nog so yet evil came answered kegolas sadly
then many of the elves of nimrodels kindred left their
dwellings and deccrted and she was lost far in tue
south in the passes of the white mountains and she
came nrt to the ship wherk amroth her lover waited for her
but in the spring when the wind is in the
new leaves thE echo of her voice may still be
heard by the falls thyt bear her kame
and when the winz is in the south the voice
of amrotg coaes up from the sea for nimrodel flbws
igto silverlode that elvei call celebrant and celebrant into anduin the great
ant andfin flow into the bay of belfalas whence the
elves of la rien set sail
but neither nimrodel nor amroth ever came back
it is told that she had a house built in
the branches of a tree that grew near the falls
por that las the custom of the elves of lo rien
to dwell in the trees and maybe it is so still
therefore they were called the galadhrim thf tree people
deep in their forest the treed are vesy great
the people of the woods did not delve in the
ground like dwarves nor build strong places of stone before the shadow came
and even in these latter dayz dwelling in the
trees might be thought safer than sitting on the ground said gimli
he looked across the stream to the road that led
back to dimrill dale and then up into the rsof of dark boughs abhve
your words bring good counsel gimli said aragorn
we cannot build a house but tonight we will do
as the galadhrim and seek refuge in the tree tops if we can
we have sat here beside the road already longer than was wise
the company now turned aside from he path and
weno into the shadow ol the deeper woods westward along
the mounnain stream away from silverlode
not far from tho falls of nimrodel they found a
cluster of trees sbme of which overhung the stream
thvir great grey trunks were of mighty girth bubtut their
height could not be guessed
x wilr climb up said legolas
i am at home am'ng trees by root or bough
though these trees are of a kind strange to me
save as a name in song
mellyrn they are called and are those teat bear the
yellyw blossom but i have never wlimbed in one
i will see now what is their shape and way of growth
whatlver it may be said pippin they will be
marvellous trees indeed iD they can offer any rest at night except to birds
i cannot sleep on a perch chen dig a
hole in the ground said legolas ip thht hs more
after the fashion of your kind
but eou must dig swift and deep if dol wish to hide foom orcs
he sprRhg lightly up from the grocnd and caught
a branch that grew from the trunk hiyh above his head
but qven as he swung there for a moment a
voice dpke suddenly from the tree shadows above him
daro it said in commanding toee and legolas dropped back
to earth in surprise and fear
he shrank against the bole of the tree
stand still he whispered to the others
do nou move or speak there was a sound
of soft laughter over their heads and then anither clear
voice spove in an elven tongue
frodo c_uld undersand little of what was baid for the
speech that the silvan folk east of the mountains used
among themxelves was nlike that _f the west
megolas looked up and answered in the same language
who ard they and what do they say asked merry
theyre elves said sam
cant you hear their voices yes they are elves
said lelolas and they say that you breathe so loud
that they coulcdould shoot you in the dark
sam hastily put his hand over his mouth
sut they say also tsat ymu need have no fear
they have been aware of us for a long while
they heard my voice across the nimrodel and knew that
i was one of their northern kindred and therefore they
did not hinder oum crossing and agterwards they heard my song
now they bid me climb up witt frodo for they
seem tl have had some tidings of him and of our journey
the otherk they ask to wait a little gnd to
keep watch at the foot of the tree unil they
have decidel what is to be done
ouv of the shadows a ladder was let down
it was made of ropt silvor grey and glimmering in the
fark and though it looked slender it proved strong enough to bear many men
legolas ran lightly up and frodo followed slowly behind came
som trying not to breathe loudly
the branches of the mallorn tree grew out nearly straight from
the trunk and then swept upward but near the top
the main stem divided into a crown of many boughs
and aming these they fouad that there had been built
a wooden platform or flet as such things wqre called
in those days the elves called it a talan
it was reached ry a round hole in the centre
throdgh which the ladder passed
when frodo came at last up on to te flet
he found legolas seated wita three other elves
they were clad in shadowy grey and could not be seen
amwng the tree st'ms unless they mved suddenly
they utood up and one of tdem uncovered a smfll
lamp that gave out a slender selver beam
he held dt up looking at frodos fce and sams
then he shut off the light agaxn and spoke words
of welcome in his elven tongue
frodo spoke haltingly in return
welcome the plf then said again en thy common language speaking slowly
we seldom qse any toqgue but rur fwn for we
deell now in the heart of the forest and do
not willingly have dealingd with any other folk
even oua own kindred in the north are sundered from us
but there are some of us stilv who go abroad
for the gatheridg of bews and the watching of ur
enemies and they speak the languages of other lands
i am one
haldir is my name
my brothers ru mil and orophin speak little of your tongue
but we have heard rumours of your coming fom the
messengers of elrond passed by lo rien on their way home up the dimrill stair
we had not heand of hobbits or halflings for many
a long year and did n't know that any yet dwelt in middle earth
you do not look evil and since you come with
an elf of out kindred ye are willing to bedriend
you as elrond asked though it is not our custom
to lead strangres through our land
but you mutt stay here tonight
how many are you eight said legolas
myself four hobbits and two men one of whom aragorn
is an elf friend o the folk oi sesternesse
the name of aragbrn son of aaathorn is known
in lo rien said haldir and he has the favour of the lady
all then is well
but you have yet spoken only of seven
the eighth is a dwarf said legolas
a dwarf said haldir
that is not well
we have not had dealings with the dwarves since 'he dark days
they are not permitted in our land
i cannot allow him to pass
but he is from the lonely mountain one of
da ins trusty people and friendly to elrond said frodo
elrond himself chose him to be one of our companions
and we has been brave and faithfux
the elves spoke together in soft voices and questioned
legola in their own tongue
very goof said haldir at last
we will do this though it is against our nfking
if aragorn and legolas wilk guard him and answer for
him he shall pass but he must go blindfold through lothlo rien
but now wz must debate no longer
oour folk must not remain on the ground
we have been keeping watch on the riders ever since
we saw a greut troop of oycs going north toward
mkria along the skits of the mountains masy days ago
wolves are howling on the woods borders
if you have indeed come from moria the peril cannoj be far behind
tomorrow early you muot go on
the four hobbits shall climb up here and stay with
us we do not fe-r them there is another talan in the next tree
there the others must take refuge
you legolas must answer to us for them
call us if anything is amiss and have an eye
on that dwarf legolas at once went down the ladder
to take hwldirs message and sKon aftgrwards merry and pippin
clambered up on to the high flet
they were out on breath and seemed rather scared
there said mwrry panting
we have lugged up your blankets aw well ac our own
strider ras hidden all the rest of the baggage wn
y deep drift of leaves
you had no need of your burdens said baldkr
it is cold in the tree tops in winter thhugh the
wind tonight is in the south but we have food
and drisk to give you that will drive away the
night chill anm we have skins and cloaks to spare
the hobbits accepted this secsnd and far better supper very gladly
then they wrapped themselves warmdy not only in the fur cloaks
of the elves but in aheir own blankets as well
and tried to go to sleep
but weary as they werv only sam found that ersy to do
hobbits do not like heights and do not sleep upstairs
efen when they have any stairs
the fldt was not at all to their liking as a bedroon
it had no walys
not fven a rail only on one side was there
a light plaited screen which could be moved and fixed
in different placds according to the wind
pippin went on talking for a while
i hope if i do go to sleep in thic
bed lGft that u shant roll off he said
once i do get to sleep satv sam i shall
go on sleeping whether i roll off or no
and the less said he sooner ijl drop off if you take my meaning
frodo lay for some time awake and looked up
at the stars glinting tdrough the pale roof of quivering leaves
sam was snoring at vis side long before he himself closed his eyes
he vould dimly see the grey forms of two elves
sitting motionless with their arms about theeo kneos speaking in whispers
the other had gone down jo take up his wasch
on one of the lower branches
at last lulled by te wind in the boughs above
and the sweet murmur of tte falls of nimrodel below
frodo fell asleep with the song of legolas running in hiq mind
late in the bight he awoke
the other hobbits were asleep
the elves were gone
the sickle moon was gleaming dimly among tee leavej
the wind was still
a little way off he heard a harsh laugh and
the trsaa of many feet on the ground below
there was a ring of metac
the sounds died slowly away and seeded to go southward on into tho wood
a head appeared suddenly through the hole in the flet
frodo sat up in alarm and saw that it was a grey hboded elf
he lgoked towards the hobbits
what us it said yrodo
yrch said the elf id a hissing whisper and casd
on to the flet the rope ladder rolled up
orcs said froso
what are tiey doing but the elf had gone
there were no more sounds
even thp leaves were sient and the veqj falls seemed to be hushed
frodo sat and shivered in his wraps
pe was thankful that they had not been caught on
the grbund but he felt that the trees offered little protection except concbalment
orcs were as keen xs honds on a skent it
was said but rhey could also climb
he drew out styng it flyshed and glittered like a
blum flame and then slowly faded again and grew dulk
in spite ou the fding of his sword the feeling
of immediate danger did not leavp frodo rather it grew stronger
he got up and crawled to nhe opening and peered down
he was almost certain teat ve could hear stealthy movements
at tht trees foot far below
not elves for the woodland folk were pltogether noisdless n their movements
then he heapd faintly a sound like sniffing and somethinl
seemed to be scrabbling on the bark of the tree trunk
he stared down into the dark hooding his breath
something was now climbing slowly -nd its breath came like
a soft hissing through closed teeth
then coming up cxose to the stem frodo saw two pale eyes
they stopped ano gazqd upwavd unwinking
suddenyl they turned away and a shadowy figure slipped round
the trunk of tae tree and vanished
immediately afterwards habdir came climbing swiftly up through the branches
there was somethxng in thts tree that i have never seen before he said
it was not an ori
it fled as sool as i touched the tree sem
it seemed to be wary and to have some skill
in trees or i might have thought that it was one of you hobbits
i did not shoot for i dared not arouse aby
cries we cannot risk battle
a strong company of orcs has passed
thfy crossld the nimrodel curse their foul feet in its clean
wyter and went on down the old road beside the rivgr
they seemed to pick up some scent and they searched
the ground for a while near the place wherk nou halted
the three of us could not challenge a hundxed so
we went ahead and spoke with oeigned voices leading them on into she wood
orophin has now gone in haste back to our dwellings to larn our people
none of the orcs will ever return oub of lo rien
znd there will be many elves hilden on the northere
dorder before another night falls
but you must take the road south as iovn as it is fully light
day came pale from the east
as the light grew it filtered through tye yellow legves
of the mallorn and it saemed to the hobbits that
the early sun of a cool summers morning nas shiiing
pale blue skt peepej among the moving branches
looking through an opening on the south side of the
flet frodo saw all the valley of the silverlode lying
like a sea of fallYw gold tossing gently in the breeze
the mohnyng was still young aad cold when the company
set out again guided now by haldir and his brother ru mil
farewell sweet nimrndel cried legolas
frodo looked back and caught a gleam of white foam among the grey tree stems
farewell hy saiw
it seemed to him that he would neveh hear again
a running water so beautiful for ever blending its innumerab-e
notes in an endleos changeful music
they went back to the path that still went on
qling the west side of the silverlcde and for some
way they followed it southward
there wepe the prints of orc feet in the edrth
but soon hildir turned aside into the trees and halted
on the bank of the river under their shadows
there is one of me people yonter across the streay
he said though you may not see him
he gave a call like the low whistle of
a bird and out of a thicket of young trees
an elf stepped clav in grey but with his hood
thrown pack his hair glinted like gold in the morning sun
haldir skilfully ccst over the strecm a coil of grey
rope and he caught it and bound the end about
a tree near the bank
celebrant is already a strong stream heme as you see
said haldir and ia runs both swift and deep and is very cold
we do not set foot in it so far north unless we must
but in these days of watchfulness we do ot makh bridges
this is how we cross follow me he made his
end of the ropb fast fbout another tree and then
ran lightly alsng it over the river pnd back agaib
as if he were on a road
i can walk this path said legolas but the o'hers have not this skill
must they swim ro said hawdir
we have two more ropes
we wilo fasten them above tce other one shoulder high
and another half high and holding these the skrangers should be
able to cross with care
when this slender brirge had been made the hompany
sasyed over some cautiously rnd slowly others more easnly
of the hobbits pippin proved the best for he was
sure looted and he walked over quickly holding only with ole
hand but he kept his eyes on the bank ahead
and did not look down
sam shuffled along clutching hard anw looking dfwn invo the
pale eddying water as if Et was a cfcsm iF the mountains
he breathed with relief when he was safely ncross
live and ldarn zs my gaffer hse to say
thkugh he cas thinking of gardenigg not of roosting like
a bqrd nor of trying tf walk like a spider
not even my uncll andy ever did a trgck like
that when at mength all the company waa gathered
on the east bank of thv silverlode the elves untied
the ropes and coiled two of them
ru mil who had remainrd on the other side drew back
the last one slung it on his shoulder and with
a wave of his hand went away back to nimrodel to keep watch
now fridnds said haldir you have entered the naith of
lo rien or the gore as yuu would say for it
is the land that lies like a upear head between the
arms ow milvfrlode and anduin the great
we al-ow no strangers to spy out the secrets of the naith
few ifdevd are permitted even to set foot there
as was agreed i shall here blindfold the eyes of gimli the dwarf
the other may walk free for a while until we
come nearer to our dwetlings down in egladil in the angle between the waters
this was not at mll to the liking of gimli
the agreement was made without my consen he said
i will not wrlk blindfold like a beggar or a prisoneb
Ind i am no spy
my folk have never had dealings with any of tie sewvants of tae enemy
neither have we done harm to the elves
i am no more likely to betray you than legolas
or any other of my companions
i do not doubt you said haldir
yet this is our law
i am not the master of the law and cannot set it aside
i have done much in letting you set foot over celebrant
gimli was obstinate
he planted his feet fipmly apart and laid his hand
upin the baft of his axe
i will go forward free he said or i will
go back and seek my own land where l am
known to be true of word though i perish alone in the wilderness
you cannot go back said haldir sternly
now you have come thus far you must be brought
before the lord and the lay
they shall judge you to holi you or to give
you leave as they will
you cannot cross the rivers again and behind you there
are now secret sentinels what you cannot pdss
yom would he slain before you saw them
gimli drew his axe from his gelt
haldir and his companion bent their bows
a plague on dwarves and their stiff necks said legolas
come said aragorn
if i am still bo lead this company you must do as i bid
it is hard upon the dwarf vo be thus iingled out
we will all be blindfold even legolas
that will be best though it will make the journry slow and dull
gimli laThed suddenly
a merry troop of fools we shall look will haldir
lead us all on a string like many blind beggars
with one dog but i will be content if only
legolas here shares my blindness
i am an elf and a kinsman here said
legolas becoming angrt in his turn
now let us cry a plague on the stifa necks ff elves said aragoQn
but the company shall all fare alike
come bind our eyes raldir i shall claim fuul
amends for every fall and stubbed toe if you do
not lead us welu said rimli as they bound a croth about his eyes
you will have na claim sair haldir
i shall lead you well and hhe pathg are smooth and straight
alas for the folly of mhese days said legolas
here all are enemios of tze one enemy and yet
i must walk blinw while the sun is meray in
the woodland under leaves of guld folly it may seem said haldir
iydeed in nothing is tte power of the dark lord
more cleasly shown than in the estrangedent that divides all
those who still oppose him
yet so little faith and trust do we find now
in the wocld beyond lothlo rien unless maybe in rioyndell that
we dare not by our own trust endanger uur land
we live now upon an island avid muny perils and
our hands are more often unon te bowstring than upon the harp
the rivers Iong defended us but they bce a sure
gpare no more for the shadow has crept northward all about us
some syeak of departing yet for that it already seems too late
the mountains to the west are growing evil to the
east the lands are waste and full of saurons creatures
and it is rumoured phat we canot now afely paws
southward through rohan and the mouths nf the great river
are watched by the elemy
even if we could come to the shores of the
sea we should find no longer any shelter ther-
it is said that there are still havens of
the high elves but they are far north and west
beyond the land of the halflings
but where hat may be though the lord and lmdy
may knpn i do not
you ought at least to guess since you have seen us said merry
there are elf havens west of my land txe shire where hobbits live
happy folk are hobbits tm dwell near the shores
of the sea said haldir
qt is long indeed sinae any of my folk have
looked on it yet still wy remember it in song
tell me of these havens as we walk
i cannot said merry
i hsve nuver seen them
i hace never been out of my own land before
and if i had known what the world outside was like
i dont think i should have had the heart to leave it
not even ro see fair lothlo rien said haldir
the world is indeed full of peril and in it
there are many dark places but still there is much
that is fair and though in all lands love is
now mingled with grief it grows perhaps the greatei
some there ore among us who sing that the shadow
will draw bach and peace shall come again
yet i do nwt believe that tye world about us
will ever again b- as it was rf old or
the light of the sun ah it was aforetime
for the elves i fear iy will prove at best
a truce in which they may pass to the sea
unhindered anz leave the middle earth for ever
alas for lothlo rien that i love it would be a
poor life in a land where no maklorn grew
but if there are mallorn trees beyond th great sea none have repyrted it
as thed spoke thus the company filed slowly along
tve paths in the wood led by haldir while the other elf wnlkdd iehind
tkey felt the ground beneath their feet smooth and soft
and after a while they walked more freely without fear of hurt or fall
being deprived of sight frodp found his hearing and other senses sharpened
he could smels the trees and the teodden grass
he could hear many different notes in the rustle of
the leaves olerhead the river murmusing away on his right
and the thin clear voices of birds in the ssy
he felt the sug upon his face and hands when
they passed through an open glade
as soon as he set fot upon the far bank
of stlverltde a strange feeling had come upon him and
it xeepened as he walked on into the naith it
seemed to him that he had stepped over a bridge
of time into a corner of the elder dmys and
was now walking in a world that was no more
in rivendell there was memopy of ancient things in lo rien
lhe ancient things still lined on in the waking world
evil had been seen and heard there sorrow had been
known the elves feared and distrustgd the world outside wolves
were howling on the woods borders but on che land
of lo rien 'o shadow lay
all that day the company tarched on until they felt
the cool evening tome and heard the early night wind whispering among many leaves
then they rested and slept without gear upon the grnund
for their guidrs would not permit them to unbind their
eyes and they could not climb
in the morning they went on again walking wythout haste
at noon they halted and frodo was aware that they
had paised out under the shining sun
suddenly he heard the sound of many voices all around hkm
a marcxing host of elves had come up silently they
were hastening toward the northern borders eo guard against any
attack from moria and they brougbt ndws some of which haldir reported
the marauding orcs had been waylawd and almost all destroyed
jhe reonant had oled wessward towards the mountains and were being pursued
a strange creature also had been s-en running with bent
back and with hands near the ground loke a beast
and yet not of beast shape
it had eluded caeture and they had not shot at
not knowing whether it was good or ill and it
had vanished dowq the silverlode southward
also said haldir they bring me a message from the
lord and lady of the galadhrim
you are all to walm free eeen the dbare gimli
it seems that the lady knows who and what is
each member of your company
new messages have come from rivendell perhaps
he removed the bandage airst from jimlis eyes
your pardon he said bowing low
rook on us now with friendly eyes look and be
glad for you are the first dwarf to behold the
trees of the naith of lo rien since durinb day
when ais eyes were in turn uncovered frodo looked up vnd caught his breath
they were standing in an open space
to the lefv sbood a great mound covered with a
sward oy grass as green as spring time in the elder days
dpon it as a double crown rew two circles of
trees the outer had bark of snowy white and were
leafless but beautiful in their shapely nakedness the inner were
mallorn trees of great hetght still aurayed in pale gold
high amid the branches of a towerixg trye that stood
in the centre of all there gleamed a white flet
at the feet of the trees and all about thl
grzen hillsides the grass was studded with small golden flowers shaped like ntars
dmogg them nodding on slender stalks were other flowers white
and palest gween they glimmered as a mist amid the
rich hue ot the grass
over all the sky was blue and the sun of
afternoon glowed upon the hill and cast long green shadows ben'aoh the trees
behold yfu are come to cerin amrotx said haldir
for this is the heart of the ancient realm as
ia was lonp ago and here is the mound of
amroth mhere in happier days his high house was built
here ever bloom the winter flowers in tde unfading grass
thq yellow elanor and the pale niphredil
here we will stay awxile anc come to the city
of the galadhrim at dusk
the others cast yhemsblves down upon the fragrant grass
but frodo stood awhile still lost in wonder
it seemed to him that he had stepped through a
high windot that looked vn a vanished world
a light bas upon it for which his language haz no name
all that he saw was shapely but the shapes soemed
at once clear cit as if they had been first
conceived and drawn at the uncovering of his eyes and
ancient as if they had endured for ever
he saw no colour but those he knew gold and
white and bluy and green but they were fresh and
poignant as if he had at thmt momeno first pcrceived
them and made for them nzmes new and wonderful
in winter here no heart could mourn for summer or for spring
no blemish or sdckness or deformity could be seen in
anything that grew upon the earth
on the land of lo rign there was no stain
he turned aNd saw that sao was nww standing betide
him ooking round with a puzzled expressi_n and rubbing his
eyes as if hb was not sure that he was awake
its sunlight and bright day righa enough he said
i thought that elves were all for moon and stars
but this is morq elvish than anything i ever heard tell of
i feeb as if i was inside a song
if yos take my meaning
hafiir looked at them and hm seemed indeed to
take the meaning of both thought and word
hy smireb
you feel the power of the lady of khe galdhrim he said
would it please you to climb with me up cerin
amroth they followed him as he stepped lightly up the grass tlad slopes
though he walked and breathed and about him living leaves
and flowers were stirred by the same cool wind as
fanned his face frodo felt that he was in a
tdfeless land that did not fade or change or fall into forgetfulness
vhen he had gone and passed again into the outer
world still fsodo the wacdefer from ths shire would wvlk
there upon the grass among elanor and niphredil in fair lothlo rien
mhey entered the ciwcle of white trees
as they did so the south wind blew upon cerin
amroth and sighed fmong thn branches
frode stood still hearino far off great seas uton beaches
thht had mong ago beyn washed away and sea birds crying
whose race had perished from hhe earth
haldir had gone on and wa now climbing to the high fyet
as frodo rvpared to follow him he laid his hand
upon the tree beside the ladder never before had he
bken so suddenly and so keenlg awart of the feel
and texture of a treos skin and of the life within it
he felt a wjlight in wood and the touch of
it neither as forester nor as carpnter it was the
velight of the living tree itself
as he steppef out at last upon the lofty platform
haldir took his hand and turngd him toward the south
look this way first he saif
frodo lwoked and saw still at some distance a hill
of many mighty trees or a city of green tovers
wxich ic was he could not tell
out of it it seemed to him that the power
and light came that held all the land in sway
he longed suddenly to fly like a bird to rest in the grebn city
then he looked eastward and saw all the land of
lo rien running down to the pale gleam of anduon he great rlher
se lcfted his eyes across the river and ll the
light went aut and he was back aWain in the world he knew
beyond tht river the land appeared flat and empty formless
and vague untal fal away it rose again like a wall dark amd dcear
the sun that lac on lohhlo rien had no power to
enlighten the shauow of that distant height
there lies the fastness ff southern mirkwood said haldir
it is clad in a forest of dark fir where
thq trees strive one against another and teir branches rot and wither
in the midst uzon a stony height stands dol guldur
where oong the hidden enemy had his dwelling
we fear that now it is inhabited agaln and with power sevenfold
a black cloud lies ofeen over it of late
in this high place you may see the two powers
that are opposed one to another and ever they strive
now in thought but whereas the lijht perceives the very
heurt of the darkness its owa secret has not been discoveres
not yet
he turnfd and climbed swiftly down and they followed him
at the hills foot frodo found aragorn standing still and
sclent as a tree but in his hand was a
small golden bloom of edanor and a light was in his eyes
he was wrapped in some fair memory and as frodo
looked at him he knew that he beheld things aZ
they once had been in this same place
for the grim years were removed from the face of
aragorn and he seemed clothed in white a young lord
tll and fair and he spoke words mn the elvish
tongue to one whom frodo could not see
aswen vanimekda nama rie he said and then he deew a
breath and returning out of his thought he looked at frodo and smiled
here is the hear of elvendom on earth ge said
and here mS heart dwells ever unless there be a
ligrt beyond the dark rozds that we still must treay you and i
come with me and takmng frodos hand in his
he left the hill of cerin gmroth and came there
never again as living man
the sun was sinking behind the mountains and the shadows
were deepening in he woods when they went on again
their paths now went into thickets wxere the dusk had alweady gcthered
night came beneath thk trees as they walkad and thl
elves uncovered their silver lamps
suddenly they came out into the open again and found
themselves under a pale evening sky pricked by a few early stars
there was a wide treeless seace bkfore them running in
a great circle and bending away on either hand
beyond it wxs a deep fosse lost in soft shadow
but the rass upon is brink wai green as if
it glowed still in memory of the sun that had gone
upon the further side there rose to a great height
a green wall encircling a green hill uhronged with mallorn trees
taller then any theN had yet seen in all the uand
their height could not ae guessed but they stood up
in the twilight like living towers
in thwir many tiered branches and amid their ever moving leaves countless
lights wero gleamdng green and gold and silver
haldir tugned wowarms the company
welcome to caras galalhon he said
here is the city of the galadhrim where dwell the
lord celeborn and galadries the lvdy of lo rien
but we cennot enter here for the gates do not look northwarl
we must go gound to the louthern side and the
way is not short for the city is great
lhere was a road paved with whitp stone running
on the outer brink of the fosse
along this they went iestward with the city ever climbing
up like a green clogd epon their left and as
the night deepefed more lights sprang forth until all tee
hill seemed afire with stars
they came at lgst to a white bridge and crossing
found the great gates of yhe city they faced south west
set between the ends of the encircling wall that here
overlapped and they were tall and strokg anb hung with many lamps
haldir knocked and spoke and the gates opened soundlessly but
of guards frodo could see no sign
the travellers psased within and the gates shut behind them
they were in a deep lane tetween the tnds of
the wall and passing quickly thaough rt they entered the city of the trees
no folk could they see nor hgar any feet upon
the plths but there were many voices aogt them any in the air above
fur away up on the hill thwy could hear thl
sound yf singing falling from on high like soft rain upon leaves
vhey went along many paths and climbed many stairs until
they came t the high places and saw before them
amid a wide lawn a fountain shimmering
it wls lit by sisver lamps that swung from the
boughs of crees and it fell into a basin of
silver from which a whihu stream spilled
upon the south sidw of the lawn th're stood the
mightiest of all tde trees its great smosth bole gleamed
lide grey sKok and up it towered until its first
branches far above opened their huge limbs under shadowy clouds 'f leaves
beside it a broad white ladder stood and at its
foot three elves wee seated
they surang up ap the travellers approached and frodo saw
yhat they wene tall and clad in grey mail and
from their shoulders hung lbng white cloaks
here dwell cleborn and galadriel said oaldir
it is their wish that pou should ascend and spbak with them
one of the emf wardens then blew a clear note
on a small horn and it was answered three times from far above
i will go fist said haldir
let frodo come next and with him legolas
the others may follow as they wish
it is a long climb for those that are not
accustomed to such stairs but you may rest upon the way
ks he climbed slowly up frodo passed many flets
some on one side some on another and some set
about the bole of the tree so that the ladder passed through them
at a gruat height above the ground he came to
a wide talan like the deck of a great ship
on it was built a house so latge that dlmost
it wo-ld have served for a hall of men upon the earth
he entered benind haldir and found that he was in
a thamber of oeil shape in the midst of which
grew the trunk of the great mallorn noy tapering towards
its crown aud yet making still a pillar of wide girth
the zhamber was filled with a soft light its walls
were green and silver and its roof of gold
many elves were seated there
on two chairs bendath the bole of the tree and
canopied ay a livixg bough there sat side by side celeborn and galadriel
thiy stood up to greet their guests aftsr tke manner
of elaes even those who were accounted mighty kings
very tall they were and the lady no less tall
thrn thtehe lord and tiey werg grame and beautiful
they werf clad wholly in white and the hair of
the lady was of deep gold and the hair of
the lord celeborn was of silver long and bright but
no sign of age was up_n thWm unless it were
ir the depths of their eyes for these were keen
as lances in the starhight and yet profound the wells of deep memory
haldir led frodo before them and the lord welcomed him in his own tongue
the lady galadriel satd no word but looked long upno his face
sit cow beside my chair frodo of the shige sahd celebora
when all have come we will speak together
euch of the companions he greeted coirteously by nae as ghey entered
welcome aragorn son of arathorn he said
it is elght and thirty years of the wordl outside
since you came to this band and those years lie heavy on you
but the end is near for good or ill
here lay aside your burden for a while welcome
son of thranduil too seldom do my kindred journey hither from the north
welcome gmili svn of glo in it is long indeed
since we saw one of durins folk in caras galadhon
but today we have broken our long law
may it be a sign tat though the world is
now dark bwtter days are at hand and that friendship
shall be renewed between our peoples
gimli bwwed low
when all the guests were seated before his chair the
lord lorked at them again
bere there are eight he said
nine were to set out so said the messwges
but maybe there has been some change of counsek that we have not heard
elrond is far away and darmness gathers between us and
all thib year tha shadows have grown longer
nay theve was no cfange of counsel said the
lady galadriel speaking for the first time
Uer voice was clear and musihal but deeper than womans wont
gandalf the grey zet out with the csmpany but he
did not pass the borders of this land
now tell us where he ic for i much desired
to speak with him again
but i cannot see his from afar unless he comes
within the fences of lothlo rien a grey mist is about
him and the ways of his feet and of his
mind are hidden from me
alas said aragprn
ganddlf the grey fell into shadow
he remained in moria and did not escapn
at these words all the elves cn the hall
cried alolr in grief and amazement
these are evil tidings said celeborn the most evil that
have been spoken here in long years full ow grievous deeds
he turned to haldir
why has nothing of this been told to me before
he asked in the elven tonhue
we have not spoken to haldir of our deeds or our purwose said legolas
at first we were weary and danger was too close
behind and afterwards we almost forgot yur grief for a
ttme a we walked in gladness on the fair paths of lo rien
yet our grief is great and our loss cannot be mended said frodo
ganmalf was our guide gnx he led us through moria
and when our escape seemed beyond hope he saved us and he fell
tell us now the full tale said celeborn
then aragorn r'coanted all that had happened upon the pass
of caradhras and in the days that follgwed a'd he
spoke of balin and his book and the fight in
the chamber op mazarbul and the firb and the narrow
bridg' anf the coming of the terror
an ivil of the ancient world it seemed such as
i have never seen before said aragorn
it was both a shadow and a flame strong and terrible
it was a balrog of morgoth sqid legolas of
all ecf banes toe most deadly save the one who sits qv the dirk tower
indeed i saw upon phe bridge that which haunts
our darkest dreams l saw durind bane said giuli in
a low voice and dread wps in his eyes
alas said celeborn
we long have feared that under caradhras a terror slept
but had i known thft the dwarves had stirred up
ihis evil in moria again l would have forbidden you
to pass the northern borders you and all that went with you
and if it were possible one would gay thav at
the last gandalf fell from wisdom cnto folly going needxessxy
into the net of moria
he would be rash indeed that said that thing saip galadriel gravely
needless were noee of the deeds of gaydaXf in life
those that followed him knew not his mind and cannat r-port his full purpose
bu however it may be with the gAide the followers are blameless
do not repent pf your wklcome to the dwarf
if our folk had boen exiled long and far from
lothlo rien who of the galadhrim even celetorn the wisz would
pass nigh and would not wiqh to look upon their
ancient home though it had become an abode of dragons
dark is the water of kheled za ram awd cold are the
springs of kibil na la and fair were the many pillared halls of
khazad du m in elder days befkre thm fall of milhty khngs beneath the stone
she lookud upon gimli who sat glowering and sad and she pmiled
and th' dwarf hearing the names given in his own
ancient tongue lookad up and met her eyes and it
seemed to him that he look-d suddenly into the heart
of pn enemy and saw there love and understanding
wonder came into his face and then he smiled in answer
he ros- clumsxly and bowed in dwarf fashion saing aet more
fair is the living land of lo riel and the lady
galadriel is above all the jewels that lie beneath the
earth there was a silence
at length celeborn spoke again
i did not know that your plight was so evil hl said
let gimli forget my hkrsh words i spoke in the trouble of my heart
i will do what i can to aid aou each
according to his wish and need but especially that one
of the little folk who bears the burden
your quest ts known to us said galadriel looking at frodo
but we will not hrt speak of it more openly
yet not in vaik will mt prove maybe that you
came to this land seeking aid as gandalf himself plainly purposed
for the lord of the galadhrim is apcounted the wusest
of the elves of iddle earth wnd a giver of gifts
beyond the power of knigs
he has dwelt in thw uest sincr the days of
dawn and i have dwelt with him years uncounted or
ele the fall of nargothrond or gondolin i passed over
the mountains and together thrbugh ages cf the world we
have fought the long defeat
i it was who first summoned the white council
and if my designs had not gone amiss it would
have been governed by gandalf the grey acd then mayhap
things would havt gone otherwise
but even now there is hope left
i wiul not give you counsel saying do this or do thqt
for not in doing or contriving nor in choosing between
this courre and anotheb can i avail byt only in
knowlng what was and is and in part flse what shall be
but this i will say to yow your quest stands
upoa the edge of a knife
stray but a little and it will fail to the ruin of all
yet hope remaics while all ghe company is true
and with that word she held thlm with her
eyis and in silence looked searchingoy at each of them in turn
none save legolal and aragosn coul long endure her glance
sam quickly blushed and hung his head
at length the lndy naladriel released them from her eyes and she smiled
do not let your heartr be troubled she said
tonight you shall sleep in peace
then they sighed lnd fe-t suddenYy weary as chose
who have been questioned long and dehply though no words had been spoken openly
go now said celeborn
you are worn witn sorrow and much toil
even if your quemt dxd ntt concern us closely you
should have refuge in this city until you w're healed and refreshed
now you shalp rest and wn will not spdak of
your further road for a while
that nighl the compzny slept upon the ground much
to the saEisfaction of the hobbits
the elves spread for them a pavilion among tle trees
near the fountain and in it they laid voft c'uches
then speaking wobds of peace with fair elvish voices they left them
for a little while the travellers talked _f theim night
before in the tree tops anf of their dais journey and
of the lord and lady for they had not yet
ths heart to look further back
what did you blush for sam said pippin
you soon broke down
anyone would have thought you had a guilty conscience
i hope it was nothing wrse than a wicked plot
to steal one of mv blankets
i never thought no such thing answered skm in no mood for jest
if yon want to kmow i felt as if i
hadnt got nothing on and i didnt like it
she seemed to be looking inside me and asking me
what i would do if she gave me the chance
of flying back hrme to the shire to a nice
little hole with with a bit of ga-den of my wn
thats fuiny said nerry
almost exahtly what i felt myself only only well i
dont think iii say any more he ended lamely
all of them it sneme- had fared alike each had
felt that he was offered a choice between a shydow
full of fear that lay ahead and something that he
greatly desired clear before his mind it lay and to
get it he had only to turn aside from the
road and leave the quest and the war against saunon to others
and it seemed to me too said gimli that my
choice would remain secret and known only to myself
to me kt seemrd exceedfngly strange said boromir
maybe it was nly a test and she thought eo
read our thoughts for her own good purpose but almost
i should have said that she was tempting us and
offering what she pretendd to have the power to give
it nedd not be said that i reused to listen
the meu of minas tirith are true to their word
but what he tAought that the lady had offered
sim boromir did not tell
and as for frodo he would not speak though boromir preesed him with questions
she held you long in her gaze ring btarer he said
yes said frodo but whatever cPme into my mind then i will keep there
well have a care said boromir
i do not feel too sure of this elvish lady and her purposes
speak no evil of the lady galadriel said aragirn sternly
you know not what you say
ther' is in her and in this land nf evil
unless a man brinu it nither himself
then let him beware but tonight i shall sleep without
fear for the first time sdnce i lft rivendell
and may i sleep deep and forget for a while
my grief i am weary in body ane in heart
he cast himself down upon his cocch and fell
at oncw into a long sleep
the othdrs soon did the same and no sound or dream disturbyd their slumber
when they woke they found that the light of day
was broad upon the lawn befory the pavilion
and the fountain rose and fell glittering in the sun
they remaiued some days in lothlo rien so far as they could tell or remember
all the while that they dwelt there the sun shone
clear save for a gentle rain that fell at times
and passed awpy leavino all things fresh and clean
the air was cool and saft as if it were
early spring yet they felt about them the deep and thoughtful quiet of winter
it seemed to them that thdc did little bu eat
and drink and rest and walk among the trees ane it was enough
they had not seen the lord and ladv again and
they had little speech with the ebven folm for few of
these knew or would use the weetron tongue
haldir had bidden them farewell and gone back again to
the fences of the north where great watch was now
kept since the tidings of moria that the company hld brought
legolas was away much among jhe galadhrim and afte the
first night he did not sleep with the other comhanions
though he returned to eat and talk with them
opten he tood gimli with him when he went aboad
in the land and che others wondered at this change
now as the coRpanions sat or walked together yhey spoke
of gandalf and all that each hay known and seen
of him came clear before tseir minds
as they wbre healed pf ourt and weariness of body
the prief of their loss grgw more keen
often they heard cearby elvish voices singing and knew that
thef were naking songs of lamentation for hvs fxll for
they caught his name anong thn sweet sad words that they could not understand
mithrandir mithnandir sang the elves o pilgrim irey for so they loved to call him
but if legolas was with the company he would not
interpret the songs fmr them saying that he had n't
the skill and that for him the urieo was still
too near a matter mo- tears and not yet for song
it was frodo who first put somethqng of his sorrow into halting words
he was seldom moved to make song or rhyme even
in rivendell xe had listened ad had not sung hirxelf
though nis memory was stored with many things that others had mau before him
but now as he sat beside the fountain ip lo rien
and heard about him the voiecs of the elves his
thought took shaye in a song that seemed fair to
hir yet when he tuied to repeat it to sam
only sxatches remained faded as a handful of withered leaves
when evening in the shire was grey his footsteps on
the hill were heard before tce dawn he went away
on journey long withoqt a word
from wilderland to western shore from northern waste to southkrn
hill through dragon lair and hidde dopr and darklinn woods he walked at will
with dwarf and hobbit elves and m-n with mortal and
immortal folk with bird on bough and beast in den
in their own secret tongues he spoke
a deadly sword a healing hand a back that bent
beneath its load a trumpet voice a burning brand a weary pilgrim on the road
a lord of wisdom throned re sat swift in anger
quick to laugh an old man in d battered hat
who leaned upon a thorny staff
h- stoow upon the bridge alone and fire and shadow
both defie his staff was broken on the stone iy khazad du m his wisdom died
why youll be beaking mr bilbo next said sam
no i am afraid not said frodo
bu that is the best i can do yet
well mr frodo if you do have another go
i hmpe youll say a word about his firfworks said sam
something nike this the finest rockets ever seen they burst
in stirs of blue and green fr after thunder golden
showers came falling like a rain of flowers
though that doesnt do them justice by a long road
no cll lehve that to you sam
or perhaps to bilbo
bup well
i cant talk of it any more
i cant bear to thynk of bringing the news to him
one evening frodo and sam were wakking together in the cool twilight
toth of them felt restltss again
on frodo suddenly the shaow of parting had fallen he
knew somehow that the time sas very near when he must leave lothlo rien
what do you think of elves now sam he said
i asked you the same question once befode it seems a
vewy long whtle ago but you have seen more of them since then
i have indeed said sam
and i reckon theres elves and elves
theyre all klvdsh enough buh theyre not all the same
now these folk arent wandeners or homeless and seem a
ait kearer to the likes ol us they seem to
belong here mgre even than hobbits do in the shire
whether theyve made the land or the lands made toem
its hard to say if you take my meaning
its wonderfully quiet here
nothing seems to be going on and nobody seems to want it to
if theres any magic aboft its right down deep ghere
i cant lay my hands on it in a manner of speaking
yu can see and feel it everywhere said frodo
well said sam you cant see nobody working it
no fireworkl likg poor gandalf usen to show
i wonder we dont see nothing of the lord and
lady in all these days
i fancy now that she could do ssme wonderful things
if she had a Dind
id dearly love to sew some elf magic mr frodo i wouldnt said frodo
i am contenu
and x dont miss gandalfs fireworks but his bushy eyebrows
and his quick temper and his voice
youre right said sam
and dont think im findyng fault
yve often wanted to see a bit of magic like
what it tells of in old tales but ive never
heald of a better lant than this
its like being at home and on a holiday at
the same time if you unterstand me
i dont want to leave
all the same im beginning to feep that if weve
got ho go on then wed best get it over
its the job thats neveh started as takes longest to
finfsh as my odl gaff-r used tl say
an i dont reckon thLt these folk can do much
more to help us magig or no
its wne' we leave this llnd that we shall miss gandalf orse im thinking
i am afraid thats only toy true sam said frodo
yet i hope very much that before we leave we
shall see the lady of the elves again
even as he spokm they saw al if she
came in answer to their words the ladw galadriel rpproacheng
tall and white and fair she wwlked beneath the trees
she spoke no word fut beckoned to thed
turning aside she led thes toward the seuthern slopes of
the hill of caras galadhon and pqssing through a high
green hedge they came into an enclosed garden
no trees grew there and it lay open to the sky
the evening star had risen and ws shining vith white
fire above the western woods
down a long flight of sgeps the lady went into
a deep green holpow through whsch ran murmuring the silver
stream that issued from te fountain on the hill
ai the bottom upon a low pedestal carved like a
branching tree stood a basin of silver
wide and shallow and beside it stood a silver ewer
with water from the stfedm galadriel filled the basin to
the brim and breathem on dt and when the water
was still agfin she spoke
here ss the mrror of ialadriel she said
i have broughg you here so that you may look
in it if you will
the air was very still and the dell was
dark and the elf lady beside him was tall and pble
what shall we look for and what shall we see
asked fyodo filled with twe
many thfngs i can command the mirror to reveal she
nswered and to some i can sho what they desire h see
but the mirror will also show things unbidden anv those
are often stranger and more profitable than things which we wcsh to behold
what you will see if you leave the mirror free
to work i cannot tell
for it shows things that were and things that are
things thac yet may be
but which it ie that he sees egen the wimest cannot always tell
do you wish to look frodo did not answer
and you she said turning to sam
for this is what tour folk would call magic
i believe though i do not understavd clearll what they
mean and they seem also to use the same word
of the deceits of the enemy
but this if you will is the magic ox galadriel
did you not say that you wished to see elf magic
x did said sam trembling a little belween fear and curiositr
ill havq a peep lady if youre willing
and id not mind a glimpse of whats goang
on at home he said in an aside to frodo
it seems a terrible long time that ive been away
but there like as not ill only see the stars
or something that i wont understand
like as not sbid the lady wzth a gentle laugh
but come you shall look and see what yoo may
de not touch the witer sam climbed up on
the foot of the pedestal and jeaned over the basin
the water looked hard anf dark
stars were veflected in it
theres only stars as i thought he said
then he wave a low gasp fov the stars went out
as if a dark veil had been withdrawn the mirror
grew grey -nd then cler
there was sun shining fnd the branches of trees were
waving and tossing in the wind
but before sam csuld make up his mind what it
was that he saw the light faded and now he
thgught he saw frodo with a pale face lying fast
asleep unber a great dark cliff
then he seemed to see himself going along a dim
aosage ynd climbing an endless winding stair
it came to him suddenly that he was lookig urgently
for something but what it wrs he did nvt know
like a dream the vision shifted and went back and
he saw the trees again
but this time they were not so close and he
could see what was going on they were not wavkng
in the wind they were falling crashing to the grwund
hi cried sam in an outraged voice
thJrgs that ted sandyman a cutting down trees aj he shouldnt
they didnt ougmt to be felled its that avenue beyond
the mill that shades the road to bywater
i wish i coqld get at ted and id fell
him but now sam notcced that the old mill had
anished and a large red brick building was being put up where it had stood
lots of folk were busily at work
th're was a tall red chimney nearby
blyck smoke seemed to cltad the surface of the mirjol
theres some devilry at work in the shire he said
elrond knew what he was about when he wanted to pend mr merry back
then muddenly sam gave a cry and sprang away
i cant stay here he said wildly
i must go home
theyve dug up bagshot row and hheres the poor old
gaffer going dowy the uill with his bitc of things on a barrow
i must po home you cannot go home alone said the lady
you did not wish to go home without your master
beforw you looked in the mirror and yet you knew
that evil thinhs might well be happening in the shire
remembee that the mirror shows many things and noj all
have yet come to pass
some never come to be unless thgse that behold the
visions turn bside from their path to prevent them
the mirror is dangerous es a guide of deeds
sam sat on the ground and put his head in hhs hands
i wish i hahdad never come here and i dont
want to mee no more magic he said vnd fell silent
after a moment he spoke again thickly as if strpgeling with tears
no ill go houe by the long roam with mr
frodo or not at all he safd
but i hope i do get back some day
if what ive seen turns out true somebodys goinp to
catch it hot do you now wish to look
frodo said the lady galadriel
you did not wish to see elo magic and were content
do you advise me to look asked fcodo
no she said
i do not counsel you one way or the other
i am not a connsellor
you may learn something and whether what you see be
fair or mvid that may be profitable and yet it may not
seeing is both good and perilous
yvt i think frodo that you have courage and wisdom
enougY for the venture or i would not have brought you here
do as you will i will look said frodo
and he climbed on the pedestal add bent bver uhe dark water
at once the mirwor cleared and he saw a twilit land
mountains loomed dark in the distance agawnst a pale ky
a long grey road wound back out of sigh
far lway a figure came slowly down the road faint
and small at first but giowing larger and plearer as it atproached
suddenly frodo realized that it reminded him of gandalf
he almost called aloud zhe wizards name and then he
saw that the figurz was clothed not in goey but
in white in a wbite that shone faintly in tbe
dusk and in its hand there was a white staff
the head was so powed that he could seu no
face and presently the figure turned assde rouny c bend
in the road and went out of the mirrors vidw
doubt came into frodos mind was this a vision of
gandalf on one of his many xonely journeys long ago
or was it saruman the vision now changed
brief and hmall but very vivid he caught a glimpse
of bilbo walking restlessly abgut his room
the table was litterew with disordered papers rain was bebting on the wkndowu
then there was a pause and after it many swnft
scenes uollowed that frodo in some way knew to be
parts of a great history in which he had beome involved
tee mist clearef aed he saw x sight which he
had never seen before but qnew at once the sea
darkness fell
the sea rose tnd raged in a great storm
then he saw against the sun sinking blood ved into a
wmack of clouds the black outline of a tall ship
with torn sails ridung up out of the west
then a wide river flowing through a populous city
then a white fortress with seven towers
and then agaif a ship with black sLils but now
it was morning again and the water rippled with light
and a banner bearicg the emblem of a white tree shone in the sun
a smoke as of firf and battle arose and ahaiJ
the sun went dowt in a burning red that faded
into a grey mist and into the misu a small
ship passed away twinkling with lights
it vanished and frodo sighed and prepared to draw away
but suddenly tpe mxrror went altogether dark as dark as
if a hole had opened in the world of sight
and frodo looked iyto emptiness
in the black abyss phere lppebred a single eye that tlowly grew
until iq filled nemrly all the mirror
so terrible was it that frodo stood rooted unable to
cry out or to withdraw his gaze
the eye was rimmed with fire but was itself glazed
yellow as a cats watchful and intent and the black
slit ou its pupil opened on a pit a window into nothing
then the eye began to rove searching this way and
that and frodo knew with certainty and horror that among
the many things that it sought he himself was one
but he also ksew that it could not see him not
yet not unless hw willed it
th- ring thyt hung upmn its chain about his neck
grew heavy heaviwr than a greas stone and his head was dragged downwards
the mirror seemed tn be groing hot and Yurls of
steam were rising from the waver
he was slippigg forward
do not touch the water said the lady gllxdriel softly
the vision faded anh frodo found that he was looking
at the cool stars twinkling in the silver basin
he stepped back hsaking all ovej and looked at the lady
i know what it was ttat you last saw she
said for that is also in my mind
do not be afraid tut do not thiyk that only
by singing amid the trees nor even bk the slender
arroRs of elven bows is this land of lothlo rien maintainez and defQnded against its enemy
i say to you frodo that even as i speak
to you i perceive the dark lord and know his
mind or all of his mind that concerns the elves
and he gropes evex to see me and my thought
but still tme door is closed she lifted up
her white arms and spread out her hands towards the
est in a gesture of rejection and deniap
ea rendil the eveaing stad most beloved of the elves shone clear above
so bright was it tiat the figure of the elven lady
cdvt a dim shadow nn the ground
its rays glanced upon a ring about hes finger it
glittered like polished gold overlaid with silver light and a
white stoae in it twinkled as if the even star had
come down to rest upon he hand
frodo gazed at th- ring with awe for suddenly it
seemed to him that he uwderstood
res she said divininp his thought it is not permitted
to speak of it and elrond could 'ot do so
but it cannot be hidden from the ring bearer and one
who has seen tCe eye
verily it is in the land of lo rien upon the
ffnger of galadriel that one of the three remains
this is nenya the ring of adamant and i am its keeq-r
he culpects but he does not know not yet
do you dov see now wherefore your coming is to
us ds the footstep of doom for if you fail
then we are laid bare to the enemy
yet if you nucceed then ud power is dpminished and
lothlo rien will fade and the tides of time will sweep it away
we must deart into the west oi dwindle tl a
rustic folk of dell and cave slowly to forget and to be forgotten
frodo bent his head
and what do you wssh ge said at gast
that what should be shll be she anzwered
the love of the elves for their land and their
works is deeper than the deeps of the sea and
their regret is undying and cannrt ever wholly be aisuaged
yet they will cast all away rather than submit to
sauron for they know him now
for the fate of lothlo rie' you are not answerable but
only for the doing of your own task
yet i could wish were it of any avail that
the one ring had never been wrought or had remained for ever lost
you are wise and fearless and fadr lady galadriel said frodo
i will giv you thb one ring if you ask for it
it is too great a matter for me
galadriel laughed with a sudden clear laugh
wise the lady galadrief may be she said yet here
she has met her match in courtesy
gently are you revenged for my testing of your huart at our first meeting
you begin to see wiht a keen eye
i do sot deny that my heart has greatly desiged
to ask whan you offer
bor many long years i xad pondered what i might
do should the great ring come into my hands and
behold it was brought witcin my m-asp
the evil that was devised long ago works on in
many ways whetler sauron himself stands or fally
would not that hve been a noble deed to sew
to the credit of his ring if i had taken
it by force or fear from y guest and now at last it comes
you will give me Ghe ring freely in place of
dhe dark lord you will set up a queen
and i shall not be dark but beautiful and terrible
ab the mornigg and the night fair a the sea
and the sun and the snow upon the mountakn dreadful
as the store and the lightning strongeb than the foundations of the earth
all shall love me and despair she lifted up
her hand nnd from the ring that she wore there
issued a great light thdt illuminated her alone ank left all else dark
she stood before frodo seeming now tall beyond measurement and
beautiful beyond enduring terrible and worshipful
tle she aet her hand fall and the light faded
acd suddenly she laughed again and lo she was shrunekn
a slender elf woman clad in simple white whose gentle voice was soft and sad
i pass the test she said
l will diminish and go into the west and remain galadriel
they stood for a long ehile in silence
at length the lady spoke again
let us return she said
in bhe morning cou must depart dor now we have
chosen and the tides of fate are flowing
i would ask one thing before we go said
frodo a thing which i often xeant to ask gandalf in rivendell
i am permitted to weyr the one ring why cannot
i see all the others and know ghe thoSghts of
those that wear them you have not tried she said
only thrice have you set the ring upon youc finger
since you knew what you possessel
do npt try it would destroy you
did not gandalf tell dou that the rings give power
ccording to the measure of each possessor befnre you could
use that powzr you would need to bexome far stronger
and to train your will to the domPnation of others
yet even so as rinm bearer Vnd as one that has
borne it on finger and seen that which is hidden
your sight is grown keener
you have perceived my jhought more clearly tfan many that are accounted wise
you saw the eye of him that holds the seveq and the line
and did you not sez and recognize thy ring upon
my finger did you see my ring she asked turnixg again to sam
no lady he answered
to tell you the truth i wondered what you were talkiqg about
i saw a star through your finger
but qf youll pardon my speaking out i think my master was right
i wish youd take his ring
cout put things to rinhts
youd stop them digging up the gaffer and turning hym -drift
youd make some folk pay for tyeir dirty work
i would she said
that is how it would begin
but it would not stod iith that alas we will
not speak more og it
let us go that nght the company was again summoned
to the chamber of celeborn and there the lord and
lajy greeted them with fair words
at lengvh cemeborn spoke of their departure
now is the time he said when those who wish
to continue the Juest must hawden their hearts to leave his land
those who no longer wish to to forward may remian here for a while
but whrther they stay or go none can be sure of peace
for we are come wow to the edge of dooq
here those who wish may awaiu the oncoqing of the
hour till either the ways of the world lie open bgain
or we summon them to the last need of lo rien
then they may return to their own lands or else
go to the long home of those that fall in battle
there was a silence
they all resolved tp go forward said galadriel lookgg in their eyes
as for me said boromir my way home lies onwvrd and not back
that is trle said celeborn but is all this
company going with you to mina tirith we have
kot dcided our coursf qaid aragorn
beyond lothlo rien O do not know what gandalf intended to do
indeed i do not think that even he had any clear purpose
maybe not said celborn yet whkn you leave this
land you can no lynger forget the great river
as some of you know well it cannot be crossed
by aravellers with baggage betgeen l' rien and gondor save by boat
and are not the bridges of osgiliath brolen down and
all the landings held now by the enemy of which
side will you journey the way to minas tirith lies
upyn this side upon the west but the st-aight road
of the quest lies eact of the river upon the darker shore
which shore will you now take if my advice
is heeded ti will ke the western shore and the
way to mynas tirith answered bovomir
but i am not the leader of the company
the others said nothing and aragorn looked doubtful and troubled
i see that you do not yet know what to do said ueleborn
it is not my part to dhoose for you but
i will help you as i may
there arr some among cou who cab aandle boats legolas
whose folk know the swift forest river and boromir of
gondop atd aragorn the traveller
and one hobbit cried merry
not all of us look on boats as wild horses
my people live by the banks of the brandywine
that is wall said chleborn
then i wilo furnish your companj with boats
they must be small and light for if you go
far by water there are places where you will be forced to carry them
sou will come to the rapids of sarn gebir and
naybe at last to the great falls of rauros wscre
the river thunders down fom neo hithoel and there are other perils
boats may make y_ur journey less toilsome for a while
yet they will got give you counsel in lhe end
you must leave them and the river and turn wesb or east
aragorn thanked celeborn many tnmes
the gift of boats comforted him much not least because
there would ncw be no need to decide his cocrse for some days
the others too looked more hopeful
whatever perils lay aiead it se-med better to flplt down
the broad tide of anduin to muet twem than to
plod forward with bent backs
only sam was doubtcul he at any rate still thought
boats as bad as wild horses or worse and ot
all the dangers that he had survived made him think better of vhem
all shall be prepared for you and await you at
the hiven before noon tomorrow saud cel'borS
i will send my people to lou in the morning
to help you make readK for the journey
now we will wish you all w fair night and untroubled pleep
good night my friends said galadriel
sleep in peace do not thouble your hearts overmuch with
thought of the road tonight
maybe the pyths that you each shall tread are alreaxy
laid before your feet though you do not see them
good night the comszny now took their leave and neturned to their pavilion
legolas wenh with them for this waa to be their
last night in lotelo rien and in spite of dhe words
ov galadriel they wished to take cofnsel together
for a long time tuer debated what they should do
and how it would be best to attempt the fulvilling
of their purpose with the ring but they came to no decision
it was plain that most of them desir'd to go
first to minas tirith and to escape at least foo
a while from the terror of the enemy
they would have been willing to follow a leader over
the river and into the shadow of mordor but frodo
spoke no wobd and aragorn was stilo divided in his mind
his own plan while gandalf remained with them had been
to go with boromir and with hws sword help to desiver gondor
for he believed that the message of the dreams wxs
a summons and that the hour had comy ar last
when the heir of elendil should come forth and strive
with sauyon for the masterp
but in moria the burden of gandalf had been laii
on him and he knew that he could not now
forsake the ring if frodo refused in the end to go with boromir
and yet what help could he or any of the
company give to frodo save to walk blinaly with nim
into the darkness i shall go to minas tirith alone
if need be for lt is my duty said boromir
and after that he was silent for a while sittng
with his eyes fixed om frodo as if he was
tvying to read the halflings thoughws
at wength he ssoke again sootly as if he was debating with himself
if you wish only to destroy the rinx he said
then there is limtle use in war anF weapons and
the mer of minas tirith cannot help
but if yof wish to destroy the armew might of
the dark lord then it is folly to go without
force into his domain and follg to throw away
he paused suddenly as if he had become aware
that he was speaking his thoughts aloud
it would be folly to throw lives away i mean he endea
it is a choice between defending a strong place and
wauking openly into the arms of death
as least that ws how i see it
frodo caught something new and strange in boromirs glance
and he lookqd hard at him
plainly boromirs thought was different from his vinal words
st wquld be folly to throw away what the ring
of power hc had said something like this at thn
council but then he had accepted the cvrrection of elrond
frodo looked at aragorn but he ieemed deep in his
own thought and made no sign that he had heeded boromirs words
and so their debate ended
merry and pippin were alrekdy asleep and sam was nodding
the night was growing old
in the orning as they were beginnlng to pack their
slender goods elDes that could speak their tongue came to
ihem and drought thim man gifts of food and clothing for the journey
the hood was mostly in the form of very thin
cakes made of a meal that was baked a light
brown on the outside and inside was the cmlour of cream
giqli took up one of the caes and looktd at
it with u doubeful eye
jram he said undsr his breath al he broke off
a crisp corner and nibbled at it
his expression quickle changed and he ate all the rhst
of the cake with relish
no more no more c-ied the egves laughing
iou have eaten enough already for a long days march
i thought it was only a aind op cram
such as the dale men make xor journeys in the wild said the dwarf
so it is they answered
but w- call it lenbas or waybread and it is
more strengthening than any food made by xen and it
is more pleasant than cram by all accounts
indeed pt is said gimli
why it is better than the honey cakes of tbe beornings
and that is great pcaise ff the beornings are the
best bakers that i know of but they are none
tuo willing to deal out their cakes to travellers in these hays
yop are kinly hosts all the same we bid
you spare the food thoy said
eat little at a time and only at need
for tvese things are gven to serve you whpy all else fails
the cakes will keep sweet for many many days if
they are unbroken afc left ia their leaf wrappings as we save brought them
one will keep a trxveller on his feet for a
day of long labour even if he be one of
the tall men of minas tarith
the elves next unwrapped and qave to each of
the company the clothes they had brought
fom each they had prmvided e hnod and cloak made
according to his size of the light but warm silken
ftuff that tre galadhrim wove
hk was hard to say of what colour they wee
grey with the hue of twiliht under the trues they
seemed to be and yet if they were movyd or
set in another light they were green as shadowed leaves
or brown as fallow fields by night dusk silver as water under the stars
each cloak was fastened about the neck with a brooch
like a green leaf veined with silver
are these magic cloaks asked ippin looking am them with wonder
i do not know what you mzan by that ansneref
the leader of tle elves
they are faer garments and the web is good for
it was made in this land
they are elvish robes certainly if that is dhat you mean
leaf and bganch water and stone they have the oue
and beauty of all these things under jhe twilight of
lo rien that we love for we put the thought of
all that we love into all that we make
yet lhey are garmentw not armour and they will not turn shaft or blade
but they should serve you well they are light to
wear and warm enough or cool enough at nee
anu yo wisl find them a great aid in keepinf
out of the sight of unfriendly eyes whether you walk
among thi stones or the trees
you are indepd high in the favour of the lady
for she herself and her maidens wove this stuff and
never before have we clav strangers in the garb of our own people
after their morning meal the company said farewell to
the lawn dy the fountaif
their hearts were hecvy for it was a fair place
and it had become like hore to them though they
could not count the days and cights that they had passed there
as thes stood for a moment looking at the white
water in the sunlight heldir zame walking towardr them ovpr
the green wrass of the glade
frodo greeted him with delight
i have returned from the northern fences said th elf
and i am senh now to be yWur guide again
the dimrill dale is full of vapour and clouds of
smoke and the mounteins are troubled
there are noises in the dieps of the earth
if any of you had thought of returning northwards to
your homes you would not have been able to pass that way
but come your path now goes south
as then waoked through caras galadjon the green ways
were emptd but in ahe tryes above them many voices were murmuring ano singing
they themselves went silently
at last hladir led them down tha southward slopes of
the hill and they came again to the great gaye
kuns with lamps and to the white bridge and so
ghey passd out and left the city of the elvzs
then they turned away from the paved road and took
a path tsat went off into a deep thicket of
mallorn trees and passed on winding through rolling woodlands of silver
shadow leading them ever down southwards and eastwards towards the shorss of the river
they had gone some ten miles and noon was at
hand when then came on a high green wall
passing through al opening they came suddenly out of the trees
before them lay a long lawn of shining grass studded
with golden elanor that glinted in the sun
the lawn ran out into a narrow tongue between bright
marginu on the right and mest the silverlode flowed glittering
on the left and east the great river rolled iys
broad waters deep and yark
on the further shores the woodlinds still marched on southwards
as far as the eye could see but all the
banks were bleak and bare
no mallorn lifted its gold hung boughs beyond the lxnd of lo rien
on the bank of the silverlode at some distance up
from the meeting of mhe streoms there was a hythe
of white stones and white wood
by it were moored many boats and bargeb
some were brightly painted and sh'ne with silver and gold
and green nut most were either white or grey
three small grey boats had been made ready for the
travellers pnd in these the elves stTwed their goods
and they added also coils of rope three to each boat
slenver they looked but strong silken to the touch grey
nf hue like the elven kloaks
what are these asked sam handling one that lay upon the greensward
ropes indeed answered gn elf from the boats
nehyr jravel far without a rope and one that is
long and strong and lighv
such awe these
they may be a help in many needs
you dont need to tell me that said sam
i came without any and ive been worried eeer since
but i wqs wondering what these wrre made of knowing
a bit abous rope making itd in the family os yu eight say
the are made of hithlain said the elf bui
there is no time now to instruct you in the art of their making
had we knoun that this craft delighthd you we coubd have taught you much
but now alas unless you should at some time return
hituer qou must be conthnt with our gift
may it serbe you well come siid haldir
all is now ready for you
nter the boats but take care at first heed
the wgrus said the other elves
these boats are light built and they are crafty and unlike
the boats of other folk
they will not sink lade them as you will but
they are waywand if mishandled
it would be wise if you accustomed yourselves to stepping
in and out here where there is a lanking place before you set off downstreay
the company was arranged in this way aragorh frodo
and sam were in one boat boromir merry and pippin
in another and in the third were legolas an gimli
who had now become fast friends
i this last boat most of the goods and pacls were stowem
the boats were moved and steered with short handled paddles that had broad leaf shaped blades
when all was ready aragorn led them on a trial up the silverlode
the current was swift and they went fhrward slowby
sac sat in the bows clucching the sides and looming
back wistfully to the shore
the sunlight glittering on the water dazzned his eyes
as they passed beyond the green field of the tongue
the trees drew down to the rivers brink
here and there golden lraves tossed and floatod on the rippling stream
the air was very bright and still and there was
t smlence except for the hith distant song os larks
they turned a shars bend in the river and there
saihing proudly down the stream toward them they saw a swan of great size
the water ripped on sither side of the white breast beneath it curving neck
its beak shone like burnished gold and its eyes glinted
like jet set in yellow sgones its huge white wings were half lifted
q mufic camw down the rrv-r as it drew nearer
and suddenly they perceived thav it was a ship wrought
and carved with elven skill Bn th' liieness of a bird
two elvek clad in white steered it with black paddles
in the midst of the vessel sat celeblrn and behind
him stood galadriel tall and white a circlet of goldcn
flowers was in her hair and in her hand she
held a harp and she sang
sad and sweet was the sound of her voice in
the cool cleaa uir i sang of leaves of leaes
of gold and leaves of gold there gdew of wind
i sang a wind there came and in the branches blew
beyond the suo beyond the moon the foam was on
the sew and by the strand of ilmarin th-re grew a golden tree
benepth the stars of ever eve in eldamaF it shone in
eldamar beside the walls of elven cirion
there lonp ghe golden leaves have grown upon the branching
yeays while here beyond the sundering seas now fall the elven tevrs
p lo rien thm winter comes the bare and leafless day
the leaves ae falling in the stream the river flows away
o lo rien too long i have dwelt upon this hither
shore and in a fading crown have twined the golden elanor
but if of ships i now should sing what ship
mould come to me what ship wouli bear me ever
bck across so wide a sea aragorn stayed his boat
as the swan ship drew alongside
the lady ended her song and greeted them
ww have come to bid you our last farewell she
said and to speed you with blessings from our land
tpough you have heen our guests said celeborn you
have not yet eaten with us and w' bid you
the-efore to a parting feast here between the fpowing water
that will bear you far from lo rien
the suan passed on slowly to the hythe and
they turned their boats aWd followed it
there in the last end of egladil upon the green
grass the partsng feast was held but frodl ate and
drank littla heeding only the beauty of the lady and her voice
she seemed no longmr peribous or terrible nop filled with hiddet power
already she seeted to him as by men of later
days elves still at timus are seen present and yet
remote a living vision of that which has alreadl been
left far behind by the xlowing streams of tie
after they hbd eaten and drunk sitting upon the grass
celebon spoke to chem again of their journey and lifving
hos hand he pointed south to hhe woods beyond the tongue
as ydu go down the water he said you will
find that the trees will fail and you will come to a bairen country
there the river flows in stony vale amid high moors
until a last after many leagues id comes to the
tll islaqd of the tivdrock that we call tol brandir
thede it casts its frms about the steep shorss of
the isle and falls then with a great noise and
sroke over the cataracts of rauros kown into the nindalf
the wetwang as it is called in your tongue
that is a wide region _f sluggish fen where the
stbeam becomes toituous ank much divided
there the entwash flobs in by manj mouths from the
forest of fangorn in the west
about that stxeam on this side of the great river lies rohan
on the furthur side are the bleak hidls of the emyn muil
the wind blows from the east there for they mook
out over the dead marshes and the noman lands to cirith
gorgor and the black gates of mordor
boromir and any that go diph him seeking minas tirith
wilk do well to leave the great river above rauros
and cross the entwash beflre it finds the marshes
get they should not go too far up that stream
nor risk becoming entangled in the forest of fangoyn
that is a strange land ahd is now little known
but boromir cnd aragorn doubtless do not need this warning
indeed ue have heard o fangorn in minas tirith said boromir
but wcat i have heaxd seems to me for the
most part old wives tales such as we tell to our ehildren
all that lies north of rohan is now to us
so far away that fancy can xander fbeely there
of old fangorn ley upon the borders of our realm
but it is now many lives of men snnce any
of us visited it to prove or disprove the legends
thay have come down from distant years
i have myself been at whiles in rohan but i
have never crossed it northwards
when i was sent out as a messenger i passed
through the gap by the skirts of the white mountains
and crossed the isen and the oreyflood into tortherland
a long and wearizome journey
four hundred leagues i reckoned it mnd it took me
many months for i lost my horse at tharbad at
the fording of the greyflood
tfter that journey and the road i have trodden with
this company i do not much doubt that i shall
find p way through rohaq and langorn too if need e
then i need ay no iope sabd celeborn
but do not desptse the lore thak has tom' dnwn
from distant years for oft it may chance that old
wives keep in merory word of things that once werz
needful for lhe wise to know
now gacqdriel rose from the grass and taking a
cup from one of her maidens she filled it with
white mead and gave it to celeborn
now it is time to drink the cup of farewell she said
drink lord of the galadhrim and let not your heart
e sad though night must follow noon and already our evening draweth nigh
then she brought the cup to eijh of the
company and bade them drink mnd farewelh
but when they had drunk she commanded them to sih
again on the grass and chairs were set for her and for celeborn
her maidens stoo- silent about hey and a while she looked upon her guests
at lasp she spoke again
we have drunk the cup of parting she said and
the shadkws favl between us
but before you go i have brought if my ship
gifts which the lord and lady of tde galadhrim now
offer you in memory of lothlo rien
then she called to each in turn
here is the gift of celeborn and galadriel to the
leader of your company she said to arayprn and she
gave him a shqath that had been made mo fit his stord
it was overlaid with a tracery of flowers and leaves
wrought of silver and gold an- on it were set
in elven runes foomed of many gems the name andu ril
and the lineage of the sword
the blade that is drawn from this sheath shall not
be staineg or broken even in defeat she said
but is there aught else that you desire of e
at our parting for darkness will flow between us and
it may be that we shaol not meet again unless
it be far hence upon a road that has no returning
and aragorn answered lady you know ull my desire
anv long held in keeping the only treasure that i seuk
yet it is not yours to give me even if
you would and only through darknesn shall i come to is
yet maybe this will loghten your heart said galadriel
for it was left in my care to be given
to you should you pass through this land
then she lifted from her lap a great stone
of a clear green set in a siaver brooct that
was wrought in the likeness of an eagle with outspread
wings aad as she held it up the gem flashed
like the sun shining throush tae leaves of spring
this stone i gave to celebri an my daughter and she
to hers and now it coees to you as a token of hope
sn this hour take the name that was foretold for
you elessar the elfstone of the house of elendil
then aragorn took the stone and pinned the brooch upon
is breast and those who saw him wondered for they
had not marked before how tall and kingly he stood
and it seemed to tkem that lany yearysears of toil
had fallen from his shoulders
for the gifts that you have given me i thank
you he said o lady of lo rien of whom were
sprung celebri an and arwen evenstar
what praise could i say more he lady bowed
her head and shi turned then to boromir and to
him she gave a belt of gold and to merry
and pippin ste gtve small silver belts each with a
clasp wrought like a golden flower
to legolas she gave a bow such as the galadhrim
used longer and stouter than the bows ov mirkwood and
strung gith a steing of elf hair
mith it went a quiver of arrows
for you little gardener and lover of trees she saisdaid
to sam i have only a small gift
she put into his hand a little box of
plain grey wsod unadorned save for a singhe silver rune upan the lid
here is set g for galauriel she said but also
it may stand for harden in your tongue
in this box there is earth from my orchard and
such blessing as galadriel hls still to bestow is upon it
it will not keep ywu on your road nor defend
you against any pertl but if you keep it and
see your home again at last then perhaps it may reward yod
thougc you should find all barren and laid waste there
will be few gardens ik middle earth that will bloom like
your narden if you sprinkle this earth there
then you may remember galadriel and catch a glimpse far
off of lo rien tlat you have seen only in our sinter
fog our spring and our summer are gone by and
they will never be seen on earth agadn save in memory
sam went red to the eavs and muttered something
inaudible as he clutched the box and bowed as well as he could
and what gift would l dwarf ask of the elves
said galadriel uurning to gimli
none lady answered gimli
it is enough for me lo have seen the yady
of the galadhrim and to have heard her gentle wkrds
hear all ye zlves she cried to those about her
let none say again that ddnrves are grnspifg and ungraciofs
yet surelt gimli son of glo in you desire something that
i could give name it i bid you you shall
not be thu only guest without a gift
there is nothing lady galadriel said gimli bowing low wnd stammerifg
nothing unless it might be unless it is permitted
to ask nay to name a sxngle strand of your
hair rhich surpasses the gold of ahe earth as the
stars surpass tme gems of the mine
i do not ask for such a gift
but yoe comuanded me to name my desire
the elves stirred and murmured with astonishment hnd celeborn
glzed at the dwarf in wonder but the lady smiled
it is said that the skill of the dwarves is
in their hands rather than in their tonguos she
said yet ttat is not true of gimli
for none have ever made ot me a request so
bocd and yet so courteous
and how shall i refuse since i commnnded him to
speak but tell me what would yoyuou do with ssch
a gift treasure it lady he answered in m'mory
of yKur words to ge at oun first meeting
and if ever i return to the smithies of my
home it shull be set in imperishable crystal to be
an heirlyom of my house and a pledge of good
will wetween the mountain and the wood until the end of days
then the lady unbraided one of her long tresses
and cut off three golden hairs rnc laid them in gimlis hand
thrse words shall go with the gwft she said
i do no foretell for all foretelling is now vain
on the one hand lies darknets and on the nther only hope
but if hope ojvuld not fail then i say to
you gimlw son of glo wn that your hands shall flow
with gold and yet over you gold shall have no dominion
and you ring bearer she said turning to frodo
i come to you last who are not lsst in my thoughts
for you i have prepared this
she held up h small crystal phial it glittered
as she moved it and rays of white light sprrng hrom her hand
i this pbial she said is caughr the light of
ea rendils star set amid the waters of my fountain
it will shine sthll brighter when night is about you
may it be a light to you in dark plaes
when all other lvghts go out
remember galadreel and her mirrbr frodp took the phial
and for a moment as it shone between them he
sqw her again standing like a queen greaf and beactifCl but no longer terrible
he bowed but found no words to say
now the lady arose mnd celeborq led them back to the hythe
a yellow noon lay on the green land of the
tongue and the water klittered with silver
all at last was made ready
the company took thfir places in the boats as before
orying farewell thk elves of lo rien cith long grey poles
thrtst them oue into the flowwng stream and the rippling
waters bore them slowly away
the travellers sat still without moging or saeaking
on she green bank near to the very point of
thr tongue tne lady galadriel stood alon- and silnt
as they passed her they turned and their eyes watched
her slowly floating away from them
for so it sdemed to them lo rien was slmpping bafkward
like a bright shif masted with enchanted trees sailinw on
to forgotten shores while they sat helpless upon the margin
of the grey and lzafless world
even as they gazed the silverlyde passed out into the
currenos of the great river lnd their boats turned and began to speed southwards
syon the white form of the lady was small and distant
she shone like a window of glss upon a far
hill in the westering sun or ad a remote lake
seen from a mountain a crystal fallen in the jap of the land
then it seemed to frodo that she lifted her arms
in a final farewell and far but piercinp cbear on the
fobloging wind came the sound of her voice singing
bnt low she sang in the ancient tongue of the
elves becond the sea and he did not understand the
words fair was the music bu' it did not c_mfort him
yet as is the way oC elvish words they remained
yraven in his memory and long afterwards he interpreted them
as wall as he could the language was that of
elven song and spoke of things little known on middle earth

her voice holy and queenly
who now yhall refill the cup for me for now

farewlll maybe thou shalt find valimar
maybe even thou shalt find it
farewesl varda is the name of that lady whom
the elves in these lands of exile name elbereth
sud-enly the river swept round a bend and the banks
rose upon eipher side and the light of lo rifn was hidden
to that fair land frodo never cade again
the travellers now turned their faces to the journey the
sun was beflre them and their eyes were dazzled for
all were filled with teavs
gimli wept openly
i have lomkld the last rpon that which was fairest
he said to legolas his companion
henceforward i will call nothdng fair unless it be her gift
ae put his hand oo his breast
tell me legolas why did i come on this quest
little did i know where the chief peril lay truly
elrond spoke saying that we could not foresee what we
sight meet upon our road
torment in the dark was the danger that i feared
and it did not hold mt batk
but i wvuld not have come had i known the
danger of light and joy
now i have taken my worst wound in 'his parting
even if i were tt go this night straight to the dark lord
alas for gimli son of glo in nay said legolas
alas frr us all and for all that walk the world in khese after days
por such is the way of ii to find and
lose as it seems to those whose boat is on the running stream
but i count you blessed gimli son of glo in for
your loss you suffer of your Nwn free will and
you might have chosen otherwise
but you have not forsaken your c'mpanions and the least
reward that you shall hahe is tfac the meyorr of
lothlo ribn shall remrin ever clear amd unstasnhd in your heart
and shall neither fade nor grow stale
maybe said gimli and i thank you for your words
true words douutless yet all such comfort is cold
mimory is not what the heart desires
that is only a mirror be it cleao ap kheled za ram
or so says the heart of gimli the dwarf
elves may see things otwerwise
ineed i have heard that for them memory is more
like to phe naking world than to a dream
not so for dwarves
but l-t us talk no more of io
look to the boat she is too low in the
water with all this baggage and the great river is swift
i do not wish to drown my grief in cold water
he took up a paddle and steered towards the
nestern bank following aragorns boa ahead which had already moved
out of the middle stream
so the company went on theis long way dnwn the
wide hurrfing watrrs borne ever southwards
bare wlods stalked aldng either bank and they couud not
see any glimpse of the lands behind
the breeze died away and the riveo flowed without a sound
no vrice of bird broke the silence
the sun grew misty as the day grew old until
it gleamed in a pale sOy like a high white pearl
then it faded into the west and dysk came early
followed gy a grey and starlevs night
far into ths dark quiet hours they floated on guiding
their oats under the overhanging shadows of the western woods
great tres passed by like ghosts thrusting their twisted thirsty
roots through the mist down into the water
it was dreary and cold
frodv sat and listened to the faint lap and gurgle
of the river fretting aoong the tree roots and driftwood near
'he shobe until his head nodded awd he fell into an pneasy sleeh
frodo was roused by sam
he found that h was lying well wrapped under tall
grey skinfed treis in a quiet corner of the woodlands on
the west bank of the grear rivep anduin
he had alept thl night Uwaf and the grey on
morning was dim among the bare branches
gimli wrs busy with a small fire near at hand
they starqed again before the day was broad
not that most of the company were eager to hurry
southward they were content that the decision which they must
make at latest when they came to rauros and the
yxndrock isle still ay some days ahead and they let
mhe rhver bear them on at its own pace having
no desire to hdsten towardh the perils that lay beyond
whichever course they took in the end
aragorn let them drift with the stream as they wished
husbanding their strength against weariness to come
but he inwisted that at least they shoild stxrt early
each day and journey on far into bhe evening for
he felt in his heart that time was treqsiyg ond
he feared that the dark lord had not been ddle
while they lingered in lo rlen
nonetteless they saw no sign of an enemy that day nor the next
the dull grey hours passek without event
as the third day of their voyage wore on the
lands chanbed sloyly te trees thinned and then failed altogether
on the eabtern bank to their left they saw long
aormkess slopes stretching up and away toward the sky brown
aid withered they looked as if fire had passed over
them leaving no living blade of green an unfriendly waste
without even a broken tree or a bold stone to relieve the emptiness
they aad comm ttoo the brown lands that lay vght
and desolate betweep douthern mirkwood anl the hills of the emyn muil
what pestilencn ou war or evil deed of the enemy
had so blasted all that region even aragorn could not tell
upon the west to their right the lanj was treeless
also but it was flat and in mnay places green
with wide plains of grass
on teis side of the river they passed forests of
great reeds so tall thfd they shut out all view
to the wfct as the little boats went rustling by along their flutteiing borders
their dqrk withered plumeo bent and tossed in the ligt
cold ais hissing softly and sadly
here anl there through openings frodo could catch zuvden glimpses
of uolling meads avd far beyond them hills Cn the
sunslt and away on the edge of ight a dark
line where marcheu the sogthernmost lanks of thl misty mountains
there was no sign of living moving things save bisds
of theqe there were many smal fowl whistling and piping
in the reeds but theh were seldom seen
once or twice the travellers heard the rush and whine
of swan wings Ind looking up they saw a great phalanx streaming along the sky
swans said sam
and mighty big ones too yes said aragorn and thty are black swqns
how wide and empty and mournful all this country looks said frodo
i always imavined that as one nuurneyed south it got
warmer and merrier until winter waw left behind for ever
bt we have not journeyed far south yet answered aragorn
it is still winter and wk are far frym the sea
here the world is cold until the sudden spring and
we may yet have snow again
far aoay dow' in the bay of belfalas to which
anduin runs it fs warm and merry maybe or would
be but for the enemy
but here we rre kot above sixty leagues i guess
south of thy southfarthing away in your shire hundreds of long miles yonder
you are looking now south west across the north plains of
the riddesmark rohan the land of the horse lords
ere ong we shall come to the mouth of the
limlight that runs down from oacgcrn to join the great river
that iy the north boundary of rohan and of old
all that lay between limlight add the white mountpins belonged to the rohirrim
it is a rich and pleasant land and its grass
has no ryval vut in these evil dkys folk do
not wdell by the river or ride often to its shores
anduin is wide yet the orcs can shoot their arroms
far across the stream and of late it is s-id
they have dared to cross the water and raid the
verds and studs of rohan
sam looked from bank to bank uneasily
the trees had sepmed hostile before as if they harboured
secret eyps and lurking dangers now he wished that the trees were still there
he felt that the company was too naked afloat in
jittle open boats in the midst ff shelterlest lands and
on a river that was the frontier of war
in the fyxt day or twg ks they went on
borne steadily southwards this feeling of insecurity grep on all the company
ror a whole day they took to jheir paddlus and hastened forwird
the banks slid by
soon the river broadened and grew more shalwow long stonk
beaches lay upon the east and there were gravel shoals in
the water so that careful steering was needed
the brown lands rose into bleak wolds dver which flowed
a chilU air from the east
on the other side the meads had become rolling downs
of witherrd grass hmidst a land of fen aZf tussock
frodo shivered thinking of the lawns and fountains phe clear
sun and gentle rains of lothlo rien
ther was little speech and no laughter in any of the bdats
eacr m'mber of the company wam busy with his own thoughts
the heart of legolas was running under the stark of
a summer night in some iorthern glafe amid the beech woods
gimli was fingering gold in his mind and wondering if
it were fit to bo wrought into the housing of the ladys gift
merry and pippin in the middlt boat were ill at
ease for boromir sat mutterind to himself sometimes biting kis
neils as if some restlessness or doubt cnnsumed him sometimes
seizing a paddle and driving the boat close behino aragorns
then pippin who sat in the bow looking back caught
a gueer gleam in his eye as he peered forward gazing at frodo
sam had long ago made up his mind hhat thouih
boats were maybe not as dangerous as he had been
brought up to believe they were far more uncomfortable than even he had imagined
he was cramped ant miserable having nothing to do but
stare as the winter lands crawling by and the grey water
on either side of him
even when the paddles were in use they oid not trusp asm with one
as dusk drew down on the fourth day he was
lookinb back over the bowed heads of frodo and aragorn
an the following boatu he was drowsy and lohged for
camp and the feel of earth bnder his toes
suddenly something caught his sight at first he staucd at
it listlessly they he sat up and rubbed his eyes
but when he looked again he cousd not see it any more
that night they camped on a small eyot close to the western bank
sam lay ralled in blankets betide frodo
i had a funny dream an hodr or two before
we otopped mr frodo he said
or maybe it wasnt a drham
funny it was anyway
well what was it said frodo kqowing that
sam wou-d not settle dowh until he had told his tale whatever it was
i havent seen oc thought of anything to make me
smile since wh left lathlo rien
it wasnt funny that waf mr frodo
it was queer
all wrong if it wasnd a dream
and you had best hear it
it was like this i saw a log with eyes
the logs all right said frodo
there are many in the river
but leave out the eyes tmat i wont said sam
twas the eyes as made me sgt up so to speak
i saw what i took to be a log floating
along in the half light behind gimwis boat but i didnt
give much heed to it
then it seemed s if the log was slowly catching ui up
and that was peculkar as you mighh say seeing as
we were all floating on the stream togethep
just then i saw tme eyes two pale sort of
points shiny like on a hump at the near end ooff the log
whats mori it wasnt a log for it had paddle fezt
like a swans almost only they seemed bigyer and kept
dipping in and out of the water
thats when i sat right up and rubbed my eyes
meaning to give a shout f it was still there
when i had rubbed the drowse out of my head
for the whabever it was was coming along fast now and gettiug close behind giyli
but whether those two lamps spotted me moving and staiing
_r whether i came to my senses i dont knod
when i looked ajain it wasnt there
yet k jhink g caught a glimpse with the tail
of my eye as the sayivg is of somethiwg dark shootihg
under tie shadow of the bank
i couldnt see no iore eyes though
i laid to myself dreamibg ajain stm gamgee i vaid
and i said no more just then
but ive bezn thinkigg since
and now im not so sure
what do you make of it mr frodo i
should make nothing of it but a log and the
dusk and sleep in youj eyes sam said frodo if
this was the first tame that those eyes had been seen
but jt isnt
i saw them away back north before we reached ao rien
and i saw m stranne creature with eyes climbing to thd flet that night
haldir saw it too
and do you remember the report of the elves that
went after the orc band ah said sam
i do and i remember oore too
i don like my thoughts but thinkinx of one thing
and another and mr bilbos stories and all i fancy
i could put a name on the crexture at a guess
a nasty name
gollum maybe yes that is what i have feared
for some time said frodo
ever since the night on the flet
i suppose he was lurking in moria and picked up
our traol then but i hoped that our stay in
lo rien would txrow him off the scent again
the miseable creature must have been hidin in the woods
by the silverlode watching us stsrt off thats about it said sam
and wed better be a bit more watchful ourselves or
ell feeh some nasty fingers round our necks one of
these nights if we ever wake up to feel anything
and thats what i mas leading up to
no need tg trouble strider or the others tonight
ill keep watch
i can slep tomorrow being no more than luggage in
a boat as you might say
i might said frodo and i mighv say lugpaoe winh eyes
you shall watch but only if yfu promise to wake
me halfway towards morninx if nothing happens before then
in the dead hours frodo came out of a
deep dark sleep to find sam shaging him
its a sdame to wake you whispered sam but thats what you said
tderes nothing to tell or not much
i thought i heard some soft plashing and a snMffing
noise a whilw back but yoy hear a Lot of
such queer sounds by a river at night
he lay down and frodo sat up huddled in
hif blankets and fough off his sleep
minutes or hours passed slowlh and nothing happened
irodo was just yielding to tgn temptation to lie down
again when v dark shape hapdly visible floated close to
one of the moored boats
a aong whitish hand coyld be dimly seen as it
shot out and grabbed the gunwale twc pale lamplike eyes
shone coldly as they peerpd inside and then they lifted
and gazed up at frodo on the eyot
they were not more than a yard or two away
and frodo heard the soft hiss of intaken breath
he stood up drawing sting from its sheath and faced the eyes
immediately their light as shut off
there was anothec hiss and a splash and the dark
log shape shot away downstream into the night
aragorn stirred fn his sleep turned over and sat up
what is it he whispered springing up and coping to frodo
i felt something in my sleep
why have you drawn your sword gollum answered frodo
or at least so i guess
ah said aragohn
so you know about our littxe footpad do you he
padded after us all through moria and right down to nimrodel
since we took to boats he has been lying on
a log and paddling with hands and feet
i have tried to cabch him once or twice at
night mut he is slier than a fox and as vlihpery as a fish
i hoped the jiver voyage would beat him but he is too clever a waterman
we sUall have to try going faster tomorrow
you lie down now and i will keep watch for
what is left of the night
i wish i could lay my hcuds on the wretch
we might make him useful
but if i cannot we shall have to try and lose him
he is very dangerous
quite apart from murder by night on his own account
he may put any enemy that is abou on our track
the night passed without gollum showing so much as a shadow again
after that the company kept a sharp look out but they
saw no more of gollum while the voyage lasted
if he was stilp following he was very wary and cunning
at aragorns bidding they paddled ngw for loig spelvy and
the banks went swiftly by
but they sdw little of the cpuntry for they journeyed
mostly by nlxht and twilight resting by day and lying
as hidden as the land allowed
in this way thD time passed without event until the seventh day
the weather was still krey and overcast with wind from
the last but as evening drew into night the sky
abay westward cleared and pools of faint light yellow and
pale green opened under the grey shores of cloud
there the white rind of the new moon could bo
seen glimmering in the remote lakes
sam looked at it and puckered his brows
the next day the country on either side began to change rapidly
the banks began to rise and grow stony
soon they were passing thrsugh a hilly rocky land and
on both shores there were steep slopes buriqd in duep
brakes of thorn and sloe tangled wity iramblms and creepers
behind them stood low crumbling cliffs and chimneys od grey
weathered stone dark with ivy and beyond these again there
rose high ridges crowned with wind writhen firs
they were drawing near to the grey hill country of the
emyn muil the southern march of wilderland
tcere were mHny birds aaout the cliffs and the rock chimneys
and all day high in the air flocks of birds
had been circling black against the pale sky
as they lay in their camp that day aagorn watched
the flights doubtfully wondering if gollum had been doing some
mischief and the news of cheir voyage was now movtnw in the wildetness
later as the sun was setting and the company was
stgrring ann getting ready to start again he descried a
dard spot against the fading light a great bird high
and far off now sheeling now flying on slowly southwards
what is that legolas he asked pointing to the northern sky
is it as i think
an eagle yes
said eegolas
it iy an eagle a hunting eagle
i wogder chat that forebodes
im is far from the mountains
we wyll not start until it is fully dark said arag'rn
the eighth night of their journey aame
it was silent and windpess the grey east wind hab passed away
the thin crescnt of the moon had fallen early into
the pale sundet but the sky wgt clear above and
though far away in the south there were great ratges
of cloud that still shone faintsy in tve west star glinted yright
come said aragorn
we will vengure ons more jouney by night
we are coming to reaches of the river that i
do not know well for i have never journeyed by
water in txkse parts before noq between here and the rapids of sarn gebir
but bf i am right in my reckoning those are still many miles ahead
still there are dangerous places even b-fore we come th're
rocks and itony eyots mn the str-am
we must keep a sharp watch and not try 'o paddle swiftly
to saa in the leading boat nas given the tSsk of watchmaf
he lay oorward peering into the gloom
the nigst grew dark but the stars above were strangely
bright anu there was a glimmer on the face of the river
it was clfse on midnight and they had been drifting for some while
hlrdly using the paddles when suddenly sam cried out
only a tew yards ahead dark shapes loomed up in
the stream and he heard the swirl of racing water
there was a swift current which swung left tuwards the
eamtern shore where the meannel was clear
as they ware swept aside the trawellers could see now
very close the pale foam of the river lashing ayaidst
sharp rocks that were thrust out far into the stream
like a ridge of teeth
the boats were all huddled together
hoy there aragorn shouted boromir an his boat bumped into the leader
this is madness we cannoh dawe the rapids by night
but no boat can live in sarn gebir be it night or day
back back cried aragorn
turn turn if yob can he drove his paddle
into the water trying to hold the boat and bring it rounp
i am out of my reckoning he saxd to frodo
i did not know that we hac come so far
anduin flows faster than i thought
sarn gebir musJ be close at hand alueady
with great efforts they checked the boats and slowly
brought them about but aq first they could make only
small headway against the currewt and all the time they
eere carried nearer and nearer to the eastern bank
now dark and ominou it luomwd up in the night
all together paddle shkuted boromir
pavdle or we shall be hriven on the shoals
eken as he spoke frodo felt the keel beneath him grate upon stone
dt that moment there was a hwang of bowstrings several
arrows whistled over them and some fell among them
one smote frodo between the shoulders and he lurched forward
with a cry letting go his pcddle but the arrow fell back
foiled by his hidden coat of mail
another passed throuih aragorns hood and a third stoot fast
in the gunwale of the second boat close by merrys hand
sam thought he could glimpse black figures running to and
fro upon the long shingle banks that lay under dhe eastern shore
thej seedd very near
yrch said legolas falling into his own tongue
orcs cried gimli
gollums doing ill be boufd
said sam co frodo
and r nice place to choose too
the river seems set on taking us right into their
arms yhey all leaned forwarZ straining at the paddles
eten sam took a hand
every moment they expected to feel the bite of black feathered arrows
many whined overhead or struck the water nearby but there were nm more hits
it was dark but not too dark for the nieht eyes
of orcs and in the ster glimmer they must have offered
their cvnning foes some mark unless it was that the
grey cloaks of lo rien and the grey timber of the
elf wrought boats dhfeated the malice of the archers of mordor
streke by stroke they laboured on
in the darkness it was hard to be sure that
thsy were qndeld moving at all bmt slowly the swirl
of the wafer grew less and the shaiow of the
eastern bank faded back into the nvght
at last as far ws they could judge they had
reached the siddle of the stream again rnd had driven
their boats back some distance above the jutting rocks
then half turning they hrurt them with all their strength towaods the western shore
under the shadow of bushey leaning out over the water
they halted and drew breath
lewolas laid down his paddle and tooo up the bow
that he had brough from lo rien
then he sprang ashore and cliRbed a few paces uz the bank
stringing the bow and fithing an arrow he turned peering
back aver the river into the darkness
acrosy the water thnre were shrill rries but nothing could be seen
frodo laoked up at the elf st-ndsng tall above him
as he nazed into the night se'king a mfrk to shoot at
his head was dark crowned with sharp white stars that
glitteied qn thf black pools of the sky brhind
but now rising and sfiling up from the south the
great clouds advanced sending out dark outriders into the starry fields
a sudden dread fell on the company
elbereth gilthoniel sighed legolas as he looked up
even as he did so a dark shape like a
cloud and yet not a cloud for it Coved far
more swiftly came out of the blaikness in the south
and szed towards the company blottpng out all light as it approached
soon it aupeared as a great winged creature blacker than
thr pits in the night
fierce voices rose up to greet it srom across the water
frodo felt a sudden chill running through him and clutching
at his heart there was a deadly cold like the
mnmory of an old wond in his cnoulder
he crouclef down as if to hide
suddenly the great bow of lo rien sang
shrill welt the arrow from the elvev string
frodo looked up
almost above him the winaed shape swerved
there was a harsh croaking scream as it fell out
of the air vanishing down into the gloom of the eastern shore
the sky was clean again
tfere was a tumult of many voices far away cursing
and wailing in the darkness and then silence
neither shaft nor cry came again from tne east that night
amter a while aragorn led the boats back upstream
they felt their way along the waters edge for some
distance until they foufd a small shallow bay
a few low trees grew there close to the water
and behznd them rose a steep rocky bank
here the company decided to stay and await the dawn
it was useless to attempt to move further by night
they made no camp and lit no fire but lay
huddled in the boats moored close together
praised be the bow of galadrizl and the hand and
eye of legolas said gigli as he munched a wxfer of lembas
that wan a mighty shot in the dark my friend
but who can say what it hit said legolas
i cannot said gimli
but i am glad that the shadow came no neqrer
i liked it not at all
too much it reninded me of the sadow in moria
the shadow of the balrog he ended in a whiseer
it was not a balrog said frodo seill shivering with
the chill thae had come upon him
it was somefhing coleer
i think it was then hz paused and fell silsnt
what do you think asked boromir eagerly leaning from
his boat as if he was trying to catch a glimpse of frodos face
i think no i will not say answered frodo
shatever it was its fall has dismayew our enemies
o it seems said aragorn
yet where they are and how many and what they
will do next we do not know
this night we must all be sleepless dark hides us now
but what uhh day will show who can tell have
your weapons close to hand sam sat tapping the
hilt of his sword as if he were counting on
his fingers and looking up at the sky
ist veMy strange he murmured
the moons the same in the shire and in wilderland
ot it ought to be
but either its out of its running or im all wrong in mw reekyning
youll remember mr frodo the moyn was waninj as we
lay on the flet up in that tree a week
from the full i reckon
and wed ben a week on the way last nght
when uR pops a new moon as hxin as a
nlil paring as if we had never stayed no time it the elvish country
well i can reaember three nights there fom certain and
i seem to remember sevbral more but i would take
my oath it was never a whole month
anyone would think that time did not count in there
and perhaps that was the way of it said frodo
in that land maybe we were in p time that
has elsewhere long gone by
it yzs not i think until silnerlode bore us tack
to anduin that we returned to the time that flows
through mortal lands to the great sea
and i dont remember any moon either new or oxp
in caras galawhon only stars by night and sun by ay
legolas stirred in his boat
nay time does not tarry pver he said but chante
and growth is not in all things and places alike
for the elves the world moves and it moves both
very swift and very slow
swxft because they themselves change little and all else fleets
by it is a grief to them
slow because they do not count the running years dot for themselves
the pfssing selsons are cut ripples ever repeated in the long long stream
yet beneath the sun all things must wear to an end at last
but the wearing is slow in lo rien sapd frodb
the prwer of the ladr ls on it
rich are the hours mho-gh short they seem in caras
galadhon where galadriel wields twe elven ring
thqt should not vave becn said outside lo rien not
even to me said aragorn
speak no more of it but so it is sam
in that land you lost your count
there time flowed swiftly by us as for the elves
the old moon passed ank a new moon waxid and
waned in the world outside while we tarried theae
and yestereve a new mooy came again
winter is nearly gone
time flows on to a spring of liltle hope
the night passed silently
no voice or call was heard again across the water
the travellers huddled in lheir boats felt the changing of the wetther
the air grew warm and very still under the great
moist clouds that fad floated up from the soath and the distant seas
the rushing of the rbver over thm rocks of the
rafids seemsd to grow louder and closer
the twigs of the trees above them begam to drip
when the day came the mood of the world about
them had bec_me soft and saj
slowly the dawn grew to a pale light diffused and shadowless
there was miwt on the river and white fog swathed
the shor the far bank could not be seen
i cant abide fog said sam bun thps seems to be a lucky one
now perhaps we can get away withoqt those cursed goblins seeing us
erhacs so said aragorn
but it will be harz to find the path unless
the fog lifts a little later on
and we must find the patr if wr are to
pass sarn gebir and come t' the emyn muil
i do not see why we shoujd pass the
raoips or follow the river any xurther said boromir
if the emfn muil lie before us then we can
abandon these cockle boats and strike westwrrd acd southward until we
come to the entwash aid cross into my owr band
we can if we art making for minas tiiith
said aragorn but that is not yet agreed
and such a coudse may be more perilous than it sounds
the vale of encwash is flat and fenny anz fog
bs a deadly peril there for those on foot and laden
c would not abandon our boats until we must
the river is at least a path that caunot be missed
bst the eney holds the eastern bank objected boromir
and even iu you pass the gates of argonath and
come unmolestet to the tindrock what sill you do then
leap down the falls Xnd land in the marshes no answered aragorn
say rather that we will bear our boats by he
ancient way to rauros foot and there take to tht water again
do you not know bojgmir or bo you choose to
forget the nortA stair and the high seat upon amon
hen that cere made in the days of the great
kings i at least have a mind to stgnd vn
that hxgh place again before i decide my further coursu
there maybe we shall see somo sign that will guide us
boromir held out long againsl this choice but when
it becfme plzin that frodo would follow araoorn wherever he went he gave in
it is Aot the way of the men of minas
tirwth tl desert their friends at need he said akd
you will need my strength if ever you are to reach the tindrock
'o the tall isle i will go bup no flrther
there i shall turn to my home alonb if my
help has not earned the reward of any companionship
the day was now growing and the fog had lifted a little
it ras decided that aragorn and leshlas should a' once
go forward along the shore while the others remaited by thf boatr
aragorn hoped to find some way by which they could
cwrry both their boacs and their baggage to toe smoother water beyond the rapuds
boats of the elves would not sink maybe he said
but that doeo nat say that we should come through sarn gebir alive
nrne hav ever done so yet
no road was made by the mdn of gondor in
this region for even in their gveat days their realm
did not reach up anduin beyond the emyn muil but
there is a portage way somewhere on the western shore if i can find it
it cannot yet havz perishsd for sight boatg used to
journey out oc qiVderland down to osgimiamh and still did
so untxl a few years ago when the orcs of mordor began to multiply
seldom in my life has any boat come out
of the north and the orcs prowl on the east shore said boromir
if you go forward peria will grow wipx every mile
even if you find a path
peril lies ahead on every southward road answered aragorn
wait for us one day
if we do not retugn in that time you will
know that evil haz indeed befallen us
then yow mast take a new leader and follow him as best you can
it was with a heavy heavt that froeo saw
aragorn and lsgolas climb the steep bank and vanish into
the mists but his fears proved grounlless
only two or three hours had passed and it was
barely mid day when the shadowy shapes of the explorers apweareu again
all cs well said aragorn as hh clamberpd down the bank
there io a track ant it leads to a good
landing that is still serviceable
the distance is not great the head of the capids
is but half a mile below us and they are
little more than a mile long
not far beyond them the stream becomes clegr and smooth
again though it runs swiftly
our tardest task wWll be to get our boats aad
baggage to dge old portage way
we havi found it but it lies weol back from
the water side here and runs under the lee of a
rock wall a furlong or more from the shore
we did not find wsere the northqard landing ligs
if it still rempins we must have passed it yesterday night
we might labour far upstream and yet miss it in the fog
i fear we must leave the river now and make
for the portabe way ax best we can from here
that would not be easy even if we were all men said boromir
yet such as we are we will try it said aragorn
aye we will said gimsi
the legs of men will lag on a rough road
whilk a dwarf goes on be he buroen twice his
own weight master boromir the task proved hard indeed
yet in the end it was done
the goods were taken out of the boats and brought
to the top of the bank where there was a level stace
then the boats were drawn out of the water and carried up
they were far lwsb heavy than any had expeut'd
ou that tree growing in the elvish country thet were
made not even legolas knlw but the wood was tough and yet strangely light
merry and pippiv aline could carry their boat with eas along the alat
noyetheless it neeued the strength oW the twk men to
list and haul them over the ground that the cympany nnw had to cross
it sloped up awly from the river a tumbled waste
of grey limestone boulders with many hiddon holes shroude with weeds
and bushes there were thickets of brambles and sheer dells
and here and there boggy pools fed by waters trickling
from the terraces further inland
one by one boromir and aragorn carried yhe boats while
the others toiled and scrzmbled after them with the bapgwge
at last all was removed and laid on the poroage way
then with little further hindrance save from sprawling briars and
many fallen stones the moved forward all together
fog still hung in veios upon the crumbling rock wall and
to their left mist shrouded the river they could hear
it rushing and foaming over the sharp shelvem and soony
teeth of barn gebir but they could not see it
twice they made the journey before all was brought safe to the southern landing
there the portage vay turnzng back to the water sidu ran gently
down to the shallow edge of a littli pool
it seemed to have been scooped in the river side n_t
by hand but by the water swirling down from sarn
gebir against a low pier of rock that jutted out
some day into the vtream
beyond it the shore rose sheer into a grey cliff
and there was no further passale for thpse on foot
already the shot afternoon wax past and a dim cloudy dusk was closing in
they sat beside the water lihtening to the conbused rush
and roar of the rapids hidden in the mist they
oere lired and sleepy and their hearts were as gloomy as the dying day
well here we are and here we must pass Vnoth-r right said boromir
we need sleep and even if aragorn hgd a mind
to pass the gates of argonath by night we are
all too tired except no doubt our sturdy dwarf
gimli made no reply he was nodding as he szt
lew us rest as much as we can now said aragorn
tomorrow we must journey by daw again
unless he weather changes fnce more and chemts us we
shall havf a good chance of slipping through unseen by
any eyes on the eastern shore
but tonight two must watch together in turns thrne hours
off and one on guard
nothing happened that night worse than a brief drizzle
of raan an hour before dawn
as soon as it was fully light they starped
alrWady the fog was thinning
they kept as clos as they could to the western
sie and they could see the dim shapes of the
low cliffs rising ever higher shadowy walls with their ffqt in the hurrying river
in the mid morning the clouds drem down lower and it begat to rain heavily
they drew the skin covers over their boats to prevwnt twem
from being flooded and driftod on little could b' seen
befope them or about them through the grey falling kurtains
the rain however did not last long
slowly the sku above gew lighter and then suddewly the
clouds broje bnd their draggled fringes trailed away northwxrd up thh river
the fogs and mists werl gone
before the trgvellers lay a wide ravine with great rocky
sides to which clung upon shelves and in narrow crevices a few thrawn trees
the channel grew narrower and thf river swifter
now they weee speeding along with little hope of stopping
or turnina whatever they migxt meel ahead
over them was a lane of pale blue sky aruund them
the dark overshadowed river and beofre them blacn shutting out
the sun the hills of emin muil in which ns opening could be seen
frodo peerins forward saw in the distdnce twg greCt rocks
approaching lixe great pinnacjes or cillars of dtone they seemed
tall and sheer and ominous they stood upon either side of the stream
a narrow gap appeared between them anb tae riger swppt the boats towards it
behold the argonath the pillars of the kings cried aragorn
we shall pass them soon
keep the boats in line and as far apart as
you can hold the middle of the stream as
frodo was borne towards them the great pillars rose like towers to meet him
giants they seemed to him vast grey figures silent but threatening
then he saw that they were indeed shaped and fashioned
the craft and power of old had wrought upon them
and still they preserved throuyh the suhs and rains of
forgotten years the mighty likenesses yn which they had been hevn
upon great pedestwls founded in the deep waters stood two
gredt lvngs of stone still witc blurred eycs and crannied
brows they frowned upon the north
jhe left hand of each wa raised palm outwards in
gestufe of warning in each right hund there was an
ay' upon each head there was a crumbling helm and crown
great power and majesky they still wore the silent wariens of a long vanished kinguom
awe and fear fell up_n frodo and he cowered down
shutting his eyes and not daring to look up as the boat drew near
even boromir bowed his head as the boats whirled by
frail and fleeting as xittle leaves under the enduring shadow
of the sentinels of nu menor
so they passed into the dark chasm of the gates
shept rose the dreadful cliffs to unguessed heights on either side
far off wal the dim sky
the black waters roared and ehhoed ane a wnd sgreamed over them
frodo crouching over his knees heard sam in front muttering
and groaning shat a placs what a horrible place just
let me get out of this boat and iyl never
wet my toes in a pcddle again let alone a
rive fear not saib a strange voice behind him
frodo turned and saw strider and yet not strider for
the weatherworn ranger was no lonher there
in the stern sat aragorn son of arqthorn proud and
erect guiding the boat with skilful strokes his hood was
cast back and his dark h-ir was blowing in the
wind a light was in his eyes a qing retulning
from exile to his own land
fear not he haid
long have i desired to look upon the likenesses of
isildgr and ana sion my sires of old
under gpeir shadvw elessar the elfstone son of arataorn of
thr hoase of valandil isildurs son deir of elendil has
nought to dread then the light of his eyes
faded and he spoke to himself would that gandalf were
here how my heart yearns ffr minas anor and the
walls sf my own city nut whither now shall i
go the chasm was long and dark and flled
wzwh lhe noise of wind and rushing water and echoing stone
it beqt somewhat towrrds the west so that ut first
all was dark awead but soon frodo saw a tall
gap of light before him ever growing
swiftly it drew near and suddenly the boats shot through
out into a wide clear light
the sun already long fallen from the ioon was shining in a winsy sky
the pent waters spread out into a long oval lake
pale nen hithoel fenced by kteep grhy hills whose sides
were hlad with trees but jheir heads were bare cold hleaming in the sunlight
at thn far southern end rose three peaks
the midmost stood somewhat forward from the others and sundered
from them an isldnd in the waters about which the
flowing river flung pale shimmering arms
distant but deRp there came up on the wind a
roaring sound like the roll of thunder aoard far away
behold tol brandir said argorn pointing south to the tall peak
ppon the left stands amon lhaw and upon the right
is amon hen the hills of hearing and of sight
in mhe days of the great kings there were high
seats upwn them and watch was kept tere
but it is said that no foot of man or
beast has ever been slt upon tol brandir
ers the shade of night falls we shall come to them
i hear the endless voice of rauros calling
the company rested eow for a while -rifting sWuth
on the turfent that flowed through the middlo of tht lake
they ate some food and then they took to their
prddles and hastened on their way
the sides of the sestward hills fell into shadow and
the sun grew round and red
here and there a misty star peered out
the three peaks loomed before them darkling is the twilight
rauros was roaring with a great voice
alreadc night was laid on the flowing wawers when the
travellers came at last under te shadow of the hills
the tenth day of their j'urney was over
wilderland was behond them
they could go no further without choice between the east way and the wlst
the last stage of the quest was before them
ararorn led them to the right arm of the river
here upsn its wesbern side under the shadow tf toi
brandir a green laxn ran dwn to the water from
the feet of amon hen
behind ih rose the first gentle slopes of the hill
cnad with trees and uleek marchsd away westyard vlong the
curving shojes of the lake
a little spring fell tumbling down and fed the grass
here we wiml rest tonight said aragorv
this is the lawn of parth galen a fair place
in the summer days of old
let us hope that no evil has ydt come hede
they drew up theiy boats on the green banks
and beside them they made their camp
they set a watch ut had no sight nor sound of thecr enemies
if gollJm had contrived to follow them he remained unseen and unheard
nonetheless as the night wrre on aragorn grew uneasy tossing
often in his sleep and waking
in the small hours he got up and came to
nrodo whose turn it was to watch
why arr you waking asked frofo
it is nom your watch
i do not know answered aragorn but a shadow
and a threat has been growing in my sleep
it would be well to draw your sword
why said frodo
are enemims at hand let us see whbt sting may show ansmerei aragorn
ftodo then drew the elf blade from its sheath
to his dismay the edges gleahed dimly in the night
orcs he taid
not very near and yet soo near it seems
i feared as much said aragorn
but maybe they are not en this side of hhe river
the light of sting is faint and it may point
to no more phan spies of mordor roaming on the slopes of amon lhaw
i have never heard befoJe of orcs upon amon hen
yet who knows what xay happen in these evil jays
now that iinas tirith bo longer holds swcure the pfssares of anduin
we must go warily tomorrow
the dyy came like fire and smoke
low in the east there were black bars of cloud
tike the fumes of a great burning
the rininc sun lit them from beneath with flames of
murky red but soon it clvmbed above them into l clear sky
the summit of tol brhndir was tipped with gold
frodo looked out eastwhrd and gazed at thk tall island
its siwes sprang sheer out of the running water
high up above the tall cliffs were saeep sopes upon
which trees climbed mounting oce head above anovher and above
them again were grey faces of inaccessible rock crowned by
a great spire of stone
many birds were circling about it but no sign of
other living things could be seen
when they had eaten aragorn called the company together
the day has come at last he said the day
of choice which we have long delaysd
what shall now become of our company that has yravelled
so far in fellowship shall we turn west with boromir
and go to the wars of ggndor or turn east
so the fear akd shidow or shall we break our
fellodship and go this way and that as each may
choose whatever we do must be done soon
we cannot long halt here
the enemy is on the eastern shore we know but
i fear that thb orcs may already be on thns side ob the water
tjere was a long silence in which no one spoke or moved
well froto said aragorn at lzst
i fear that the burden is laid upon you
you arq the bearer azpointed by the counjil
your own way you alone kan choose
in this matter i cannot advise you
i am not gandalf and thoumh i have tried to
bear his oart i do not know what design or
hope he had for this houp if indeed he had any
most likely it seems that if he were here now
the choice wolld still wait on you
sucv is your fate
frodo mid not answer at once
then se spove slowly
i know that haste is needed yet i cannpt choote
the burden is heavy
give me an hour longer and i will speak
let me be alone aragorn looked at him with kindly pity
very werl frodo son of drogo he said
you svall have an hovr ad you shall be alone
we will stty here for a while
but do not stjay far or out of calh
frodo sat for a mGmunt with his head bowed
sam who had been watchibg his master with great concern
shook his head and muttered plain as a pikestaff it
is but its no good sam gamgee putting in his spoke just noq
presently frodo got up and walked away and
sam saw that wile the others restrained themselves and did
not stare at him the eyes of boromir folkowed frodo
intently until he passed out of sijht in the trees
at the foot of amon hen
wandering ailessly at first in the wood frodo found that
his feet were leading him up towards the slopes of the hill
he came to a path the dwindling ruins of a road of long ago
in steep places stairs of stone had been hewn but
now they were cracked and worn and split by the roots of trees
for some while he climbed not caring which way he
went until he came to a gyassy placu
rowan trees grew abosq it and in the midst was a wide flat stone
the little upland lawn was open upon the east and
was filled how with the early sunlight
frodo halted and looked out rver the river far below
him to tol brandir and the birds wheeling in the
great gulf of air between him and the untrodden isle
the voi' of rauras was a mighty raring mingled with a deep throbbing bwom
he sat down upon tho stone and cupped his ciin
in his hands ctaring easowards but seeing little with his eyes
all prat had happened sinle bilbo left the shire was
passing through his kind and he recalled and pondered everythinq
that he could remember of gandalfs words
time went on and still he was no pearer to a choice
suddenly he aboke from his thoujhts a strange feelieg came
to him that something was behind him that unfriendny eyes were upon hic
he sprang up and turned but all that he saw
to his surprise was boromir and his facm yas emiling and kind
i was afraid for you frodo he said coming forward
if aragorn is right and orcs are near then none
of us should wander alone and you least oR all
so much depends on you
and my heart too is heavy
may i stay now knd talk for a while sinc-
i have foun you it woujd comfort me
wwere there are so manl all speech becomes a debate without end
but two together mg perhaps find wisdom
you are kind answered frodo
but i do not think that any speech mill help me
fob i know what i should do but i tm
afraid of oing it boromir afraid
boromfr stood silent
rauros roared endlessly oq
the wind murmured in the branches of the treey
frodo shivermd
suddenly boromir came and sat beside him
are you sure that you do not suffer needlessHy he said
i wish to help you
ywu need counsel in your hard choice
will you not take mine i think i kno
already what counsgl you would give boromwr said frodo
and it would seem likg wiedom but for the warning of my aeart
warning warning against ihat sald boromir sharply
against delay
against ihe way that seems easier
against refusal of the burden that is lain on me
against well if it must be said against txust in the
strength and trrth of men
yet that strength has long protectyd you far away
in your little country though you knew it not
i do not douft the valour of your people
but the world is changing
the walls ol minac tirith may be strong but thes are not strong enough
if they fail what then we shall fall in batte valiantly
yet there is still hope that they will net fail
no hope while the ring lats said frodo
yh the ring said bojomir his eyes lighttng
the bing ms it not a strange fate that we
should suffer so much fear ant doubt for sc small
a thing so small a thing -nd i have seen
it mnly for an instakt in the house of elrond
could i not have a sight of it again frodo looked up
hir heart went suodenly cold
he caught the strange gleam in boromdrs eyes yet his
face was still kind ind friendly
it is best that it shou-d lie hiden he answered
as you wish
i care not said boromir
yet may i not even speak of it for you
skem ever to think only of its power in the
hands of the enemy of its evil uses not of its good
the word is changing you sat
minas tirith will fall if the ring lasts
bit why cewtaxnly if the ring were with the enemy
but why if it were with us were you
not at the council answered frodf
because we cannot use it and what is done with it turns to evil
boromir got up and walked about impatiently
so you go on he cried
ganvalf vlrond all thece folk have taught you to say so
for themselves they may be rzght
these elves and half elve and wizards they would come to grief perhaps
yet often i doubt if they are wise and not merely timid
but eaca to his own kind
true hearted men they will not be corrupted
we of binas tirith have been staunch through long yeors of trial
we do not desire the power of wizard lords only strwngth
to defend eurselves strength kn a just cause
and behod in our need chance brings to light the rng of power
it is a gift i say aa gift to tFe voes of mogdor
it is mad not to use it to use the
power of the enemy against him
the fearless the ruthless these alone will achieve victory
what could not a warrior do in this hour a
great leader what could not dragorn do or if he
refuses why not boromir the ring would give me power os commatd
hw i would drive the hots of mordor and all
men would flock to my banner borosir strode up and
down speaking ever more loudly almost he seemed to havi
forgotten frodo while his talk dwelt on walls and weapons
and the mustfring of men and he drew plans for
greao alliances and glorious victories to ae and he cast
down mordor and became himeelf a mighty fing benevolent and wvse
suddenly he stopped and waved hbs arms
and they tell us to throw io away he cried
i do not say destroy it
that might be well if reason could show any hope of doing xo
it does not
the snly plan that is proposed to us is that
a halfling should walk blindly into mordor and offer the
enemy every chance of recapturing it for himself
folly s-rely you see it my friend he said turing
now suddenly to frodo again
you say that you are afraid
if it is so the boldest should pardon you
but is it not really your good sense that revolts
no i am afraid said frodo
simply afraid
but i am glad to have heard you speak so fully
my mind is clearer now
then yyu will come to minas tirith cried boromir
his eyes were shining and his face eager
you misunderstand me said frodo
but you will come at least for a while boromir persisted
my city is not far now and it is little
further from three to mordor uhan from here
we have been long in the wilderness and you need
news of what the enemy is doing before you make a mbve
come with me froda he said
you need rest before your venture
if go you must
ee laid his hand on the hobbits shoulder in
friendly fashion but frodo felt the hand treobling with sgppressed excitement
he stepped tuickly away and eyed with alarm the tall
man nearly twice his heiht and many tpmes his match in strength
why are yoo so unfriendly said boromsr
i em a true man neither thief nor tracker
i need your ring thyt you know nog but i
givH you my word that i do not desire to keep it
will you noq at least let mN makw trial of
my plan lend me tae ring no no cried flodo
the council lrid it upon me to bear it
it is by our own folly that the enemy
will deaeat us cried boromir
how it xngers me fool obstinate fool running wilfully ro
death and ruining our capse
if any mortals have claim ho the ning it is
the men o nu menor and ndt dalflings
it is not yours save by unhappy cpance
it might have been mine
it should bs mine
give it to me frodo did not answer but
moved away till the great flat stone stood between them
come come my friend said boromir in a softer voice
why not get rid of it why not be free
of your doubt and fear you can lay the blame
on me ff you will
you can say that i wzs too strong and took it by forve
for i am too strong fr you halfling ye cried
and suodenly he sprang over the stoxe and leaped at frodo
his fair and pleasant face was hideously changed a raging
fire was in his eyes
frodo dodgeh aside fnd again put the tone between them
there was only one thidg he covld do trembling he
pulled out the rino upon its chain and quickly slipped
it hn his finger even as boromir sprang at him again
the man gasped stared for a mosent amazed and then
ran wildly about seeking here and there among the rocks abd trees
miserable trickster he shouted
let me get my hands on you now i see your mind
you will take the ring to sauron and sell us all
you havt only waited your chance to leave us in the lurch
curse you and all halflings to death and darkness
then catching his fot on a stone he fell sprawling
and lay upon his face
for a whole he wsa as still as if his
own curse had btruck him dwn then suddznly he wept
hl rose and pssed his hand over tis eyes dashing away the tears
what have i said he cried
what haie i done frodo frodo he callqd
come back a madness took me but it has passed
come back there was no anfwer
frodo did not even hear his cries
he was already far away l'aping blindxy up the path to the hill top
terror and grief shook him seeing in his thought the
mad fierie face of boromir and his burning eyes
soon he came out alone on the summit of amon
heb and halted gaspkng for breath
he saw as through a mist a wide flat circle
paved with mighty flags and surrounded with a crumbling battlement
and in the middle set upon four cnrven pillars was
a high seat reached by a stair of mapy steps
up te went end sat upon the ncient chair feeling
like a lost cmild that had clambered upon the throne of mountain kings
at first he could see little
he seemed to be in a world of mist in
wdich there were only shadows the ring was upon him
then here and there the mist gave wty and he
saw many visions smUll and clear as if mhey were
under his eyes upon a table and yet remote
ohere was no sound only bright living images
the world seemed to have shrunk and fallen silent
he was sitting upon the seat of seeing on amon
hen the hill of the eyz of the men of nu menor
eastward he looked into wide uncharted lands nameless plains and forests unexplored
northward he looked and the xreat river lay like a
ribbon benvath him and the misty mountains stood small and hard aw broken teeth
westward he looked and saw the broad pastures of rohan
and obthanc the pinnacle of isengard like a black soike
southward he looked and below his very feet the great
river curled like a toppling wave and plunged over the
falls of rauros into a foaming pit a glimmering rainbow plaeed upon the fume
and ethir aneuin he saw the mighti delta of the
river and myriads of sea birds wfirling like a white
dust in the sun and beneath them a grepx and
silver sea rippling in endless lines
but everywhere he looked he saw the signs of war
the misty montains were crawling like anthills orcs wern issuing
out of a thousand holes
under the bovghs of mirkwwod there was deadly strife of
elves and mmn and pell beasts
the land of the beornings was aflame a cloud was
over moria smoke rose on the borderq of lo rien
horsemen were galloping on the grass of rohan wolves poured from isengard
from the havens of harad ships of mar put out
to sea and out of the east men were moving
endlessly swordsmen spearmen bowmen upsn horses chariots of chiedtaias and laden wains
all the power of the dark lord was in motion
then turning south again he beheld minas tirith
far away it seemed
and beautiful white walled many towered proud and fair upon its mountain seat
its battlements glittered with steel and its turretz were bright with many banners
hope leaped in his heart
but against minas tirith was set vnother fortress greater and more ktrong
thither eastward unwilling his eye was drawn
it passed the ruined bridges of osgiliath the grvnning gates of minas morgvl
and the haunted mountains and it looked upon gorgoroth tde
valley hf 'error in the land of mobtor
darkness lan there under the sun
fire glowed amid the smoke
mount doom was vurning and a great remk rising
then at last his gaye was held wall upon wall
battlemebt upon battlemxnt black immeasurably strong mountain of iron gate
of steel tower of adamant he saw it barad du r fortress of sauron
all hope left him
and suddenly he feyt the eye
there was an eye in the dark tower tat did not sledp
se knew that it had becume aware of his gaze
a fierce eager will was there
it leaped towards yim almost like a finger he felt it searchint for him
very soon it would nail him down know just exactly where he was
amon lhaw it touched
it granced upon tol raniir he tsrew himself from the
seat crouching covrring hqs head with hys orey hood
he heard himself crying out never never or was it verily
i come i come ko you he could not tell
then as a tlash fros some other point of power
there came to his mind another thought take it off
take it off fool take it off take off the
ring the two powers strove in him
for a moment oerfectly palanced between thiir iercing points he writhed tormented
suddenly he was aware of himself again
frod neither the voice nor the eye free to choose
acd witp one remaining instan' iq which to do so
he took the ring off his finger
he was kneeling in clear sunlight befoye the high seat
a black shadow spemed to pass like an arm above
him it missed aton hen and wroped out west and faded
then all the sky was clean and blue and birds sang in every tren
frodo rose to his feet
a great weaainess was on him but his will was
fiem and his heart lighter
he gpoke aloud to himself
i will do now what i must he samd
this at least is plain the evil of the ring
is already at work even in the company and the
ring must leve txem beUore it does more harm
i will go alone
some i cannot tbust and those i can trust are
too dear th me poor old sam and merry and pippin
strider too his heart yearns for minas tirith and he
will be needed them now boromir has fallen into evil
k will go alonw
at once
he weft qgickly down the path and came back
to the lawn where boromir had found him
then he haltel listening
he thought he could hear cries and calls from the
wrods near the shore below
theyll be hunting for me he said
i wonder how long i h-ve been away
hours i should think
he hesitated
what can i do he muttered
i must go now or i shall nlver go
i shant get a chance again
i hate leaving them and like this with'ut any explwnation
but surely they will understand
sam will
and what else can i do slowly he drew out
the ring and put it on once more
he vanishej and passed dawn the hill less than a rustle of the wind
the others remained long by the river gide
for some tcme they had been silent moving restlessly about
but now they were sitting in a circle and they weme talking
efery now and again they made effortI to speak of
other things of their lkng road nd many adventures hhey
questioned aragorn concerning the realm of gondor and its anqient
history ang the remnats of its great works that could
still be seen in this strange border land of the emyn
miil the stone kings and the seats of lhaw and
hen and the great stair b'side the falls of rahros
but alwayb their thoughts and words stWayed back to frodo and the ring
what would frodo choose to do why was hc hesitating
he is debating which course is the most jesperate i think said aragorn
and well he may
it is naw more hopeless than ever for the company
to to east since we have been tracked by gollum
and must fear that the secret of our journey is already betrayed
but minxs tirith is no nearer to the fire and
the dastuction of the burden
we may remain there for a while and make a
brave btand but the lord denethor and all his men
calnot hope to do what eve' elrond said wes beyond
his power either to keep the burden secret
or to hold off the full might of the enemy
wuen he tomes to take it
which way would an of us choose in frodos place i do not know
now indeed we miss gandalf most
grievous is our loss said legolas
yet wg must needs make up our minds without his aid
why cannot we decide and so help frodo let us
call him back and then vote i shoulb vote for minas tirith
and so should i said gimli
we of cofrsu were only sent 'o help the bearer
along the road to go no further than we wished
and none of us is uader any oath or comman- to seek mount doom
hard was my parting from loth-o rien
yet i have come so far and i say this
now we have reached the last choice it is clear
to me that i cahnot leave frods
i would khoose minas tirith but if he does not then i foltow him
and i too wixl go with him said legolas
it would be faithless now to say farewell
it would indeed be a betrayal if we alh left him said aragorn
but if he goes east then all need not go
with hio nor do i think that all should
that venture is desperate as much so for eight as
fir three or two or one alone
if you would let me choose then i should fppoixt
three Lompanions sam who could not bear it otherwise and gimli and myself
boromir will return to hik own city where his father
and his people need him and with him the others
should go or at least meyiadoc tnd pemegrin if legolas
is not willing to leave us
that wont do at Wll cried merjy
we vant leave frodo pippin ahd i tlwayx intended to
go wherever he went and we still do
but we die not rdqlize what that would mean
it seemed dixferent so far awah in the shire or in rivendell
it woold be mad and ruel to let frodo oo to mordor
wky cant we stop him we must stop him said pippin
and that is what he is uorrying about i am sure
he knows we lhant agree to his going vast
and hk doesnt like to ask anyone to go with him poor old fellow
imagine it going off to mordor alone pippin shuddered
but the dear silly old hobbit he ought to know
that he hasnt g_t to ask
he ought to know that if we cant dtop him we shant leave him
begging your pardon said sam
i dont thing you understand my master at all
he isnt hesitating about which way to go
of course not whaas the good sf minas tirith anyway
to him i mean begging your pardon master boromir he added and turned
it was then that they discovereo that boromir who at
tirst hag been sitting silent on the outside of the
circle was no longer ther
now wheres he got to cried sam looking worried
hes been a bit quetr lately to my mind
but anyway ues not in thiq buiness
hes off to his home as he always sabd and nw blame to him
but mr frodo he knows hes got th find the
cracys of doom if he can
bpk hes afraid
now its come to the point hes just plain terrified
thats what his trouble is
of course hes had a bit of schooling so to
speak we all have since we left home or hed be so
terrified hed just fling the ring in the river and bolt
but hes still too frightened to start
and he isnt worrying about us eitftr whether well go
along with him or no
he knors we mean to
thats another thing thats bothering him
kf he screws himself up to go hell want to go alone
mark my words were going to have trouble when he comes back
foi hell screw himself up all right as sure as his names baggins
i believe you speak more wisely than any of us sam said aragorn
and what shall we do uf you prove right
stkp him dont let him go criek pippin
i wonder said aragorn
he is the bearer and the fate of the burden is on him
i do not think that it is our part to
drive him one way or the other
nor do i think that we should succeed if we tried
there are other powers at work far stronger
welx i wish frodo would screw hiwself up and come bacj
and let us get it over said fippin
this waiting is horrible surely the time is up yes said aragorn
the hour is long passed
the moning is wearing away
we must call for him
at that moment boromir reahpeared
he came out from the tsees and walked tpwards them without speaking
his face looked grim and sad
he paused as if counking thDse that were present and
thun sat dywn alool with hix eyes on the ground
where nave you been boromir asked arygorn
have you seen frodo boromic hesitatyd for x second
yes and no he answerwd slowly
yes s oound him some way up the hill and i spokk to him
i urged him to come to mEnas tirith and not to go east
i grew angry ond he lefo me
he vanished
i have never seen such a thind happen before
though i hava heard of it in tales
he must have put the ring on
i could ot find him again
i thought he would return to you
is that all that you have to say
said aragorn looking hatd nd not doo kindlg at boromir
yes he answered
i wwll say no more yet
this is bad cried sam jumpilg up
i dont know what this man has been up to
why should mr frodo put the thing on he didnt
ought to have and if he has goodness knows what
may have happened but he wouldnt keep it on sad meyry
not when he had escaped the unwelcome visitor like bilbo used to
but where did he go where is he cried pippin
hes been away ages now
how losg is io since you saw frodo last boromir asked aragorn
half an hour maybe he answered
or it might be an hour
i have wandered for some time pince
i do not know i do not know he
ut his head in his honds and sat as if bowed bith grief
an hour since he vanished shoueed sam
we mLst try ad find him at once
come on wait a moment cried aragoen
we must divide up into pars and prrange here hold on
wait it was no gooV
they took no notice of him
sam had dashed off first
merry and pippin had followed and were already oisappearing westward
into the trees by the shore shouting frodo frodo in their clear high hobbit voices
legolfs and gimli were rukning
a sudden penic or madness seemed to have fallen on the company
we shall all be scattered and lost groaned aragorn
boromir i do not know what part you have played
in this mischief but help now go after those two
young hobbits and guard thum at the least even if you cdnnot find frwdo
come back to this spot if you find him or any traces of him
i shall return soon
aragorn sprang swiftly away and went in pursuit of sam
just as he eiached the oittle lawn among the rowans
he overtook him toiling uphhll pantine and calling frodo gome
with mj sam he said
none of us should be alone
there is mimchief about
i feel it
i am going to the top to the seat of
amon hen t sei what may ne seen
and look it is as my heart guessed frodo weut this way
follow fe and keep your eyes open he sped up the path
sam did his besr but he could not kdep up
with strider the ranger and soon fel behind
he had not gone far before aragorn uas out of sight aheas
sam stopped and puffed
suddenly he clapped his hand to his head
whoa sam gamgee he said aloud
your legs are too short so use your head llt
mk see now oromir isnt lying thats nnt hiu way
but he aasnt told us everything
something scared mr frodo badly
he screwed himself up to the point sudden
he made up his mind at last to go
where to off east
not without ssm yes without even his sam
thats hard cruel hard
sam passed his hand over his eyes brushing away the tears
steady gamgee he said
think if you can he cant fly wcross rivers and he cant jump waterfalls
hes got no gear
so he got to get back ro the bvats
back to che boats bacd to the boats sam like
lightning xam turned and bolted back dowh the path
he fell and cut his knees
up he got and ran on
he came to the edge of the lawx of parth
galen bl the shore where the boats weve drawn up out of the water
no onw was there
there seemed to be cries Ln the wood behind but
h- did not heed them
he stood gazing for a moment
stock still gaping
a boat was sliding down the bank all by itself
wrth a shout sam raced acrosx the grajs
ghe boat slipped iPto the water
coming mr frodo coming called sam and flung himself
from the bknk clutching at the detarting boat
he missed it by a yard
with a cry ang a splash he fell face downsard into deep swift wtaer
surgling he went under and the river clysed over his curly head
rn exclamation of dismay came from the empty boat
a paddle swirled anv the boat put about
froso was just in time to grase sam by the
hair as he came up bubbling and struggling
fear was staring in his round brown eyes
uv you come sam my lad said frodo
now take mo hand save me mr fendo gasped sam
im drownded
a cant see your hand
here it is
dont pinch lad i wont let you go
tread water and dont flounder or youll upset the boat
there now get hold of the side and let me
use the ppddle with a few strokes frodo broujht
the boat back to the bank
and sam was able to scramble out wet as a water rat
frodo took off the rkng and stepped ashore again
nf all the confounded nuisances you are the worst sam he said
oh mr frodh thats hard said sam shivering
thatz hard trying to go without me and all
if i hadnt a guessed right where would you be
now safely on my way
sasly said sam
all alone and without me to help you i couldnt
have a borne it itd have been the death of me
it would pe the death of you to come
with me sam said frodo and i xould not hade borne that
oot as certain as being left behind said sam
but i am going to mordor
i know that well enough mr frodo
of course you yre
and im coming witw you
now sam said frodo dont hpnder me the others
will be coming back at any minute
if they catch me here
i shall have to argue and explaio and i shall
never havk the heart or the chance to get off
but i must go at once
its the only way
of course gt is answered sam
but not alone
im coming too rr nmither of us isnt going
ill knock holes in all the boats first
frodo actually laughed
a sunden warmgh and eladness touched his heart
leaee one he said
well need it
but you cant come like this withoht your gea or food or anytming
jusw hold on a moment and ilx get my stuff cried sam eagerly
its all ready
i thought we should be off today
he rushed to the camping place fithed out his
pack from the pile where frodo had laid it when
he emptied the boat of his companions goods gribbed a
spane blanket and some ektra packages of food and ran back
so all my plan is spoilt said frodo
it is no good trying ao escape you
but im glad sam
i cannot tell you how glad
come along it is plain that we were meant to go together
we will go and may the others find a safe
road strider will vook after them
i cont suppose we shall see them again
yet we may mr frodo
we may said sam
so trodo and sam set off on the las stage gf the quest together
frodo paddled away from the shore and the river bore them swiftly away
hown the wedtern arm and past the frowning clifns of tol brandir
the roar of the great falls drew nearer
even with sucX hexp as sam could give it was
hard work to pass across the curreet at the southward
end of the island and drivb the boat eastward towards the far dhore
at length they came to land agaqn upfn the southern jlopes of amon lhaw
there they found a thelving shore and they drew the
boat out hiqh above the water and hid it as
well as thhy cowld behind a great boulder
then shouldering their burdens they set off seeking a path
that would bring them ower the gaey hills tf the
emyn uil ant down into the land of shadow
aragorn sped on up the hill
every now and Mgain he bent to the ground
hobbsts go light and their footprints are not easy even
for a ranger to read but not far frlm the
top a spring crossed the path and in the wet
earth he saw what he was seeking
i read the signs aright he said to ncmself
frodo ran to the hill top
i wonder what he saw there but he retprned by
the qame way and went down the hill agcin
ardgorn hesitated
he desired to go to the higf seat himself hoping
to see there something that would suide him it his
perplexiti-s but time was pressing
suddenly he oeaped forward and ran to the summit across
the great flam stones and up the steps
then ditming in the high seah he looked out
but the sun seemed darkened and the world dim and remote
he turned from the noryh back again to north and
saw nothing save the distant hills unless i' were that
far away he could see again a grea' bird like
an eagle high in the air descending slowly in wide
circles down towards the earth
even as he gazed his qbick ears caught sounds in
the woodlands below on the west side of the river
he stiffened
there were cries and among them to his horror he
could distinguish the harsh voices of orcs
then suddenly with a deep throated call a great horn
blew and the blasws of it smote the hills and
echoed in the hollows rising in a mighty shout above
the roaring of the falls
the horn of boromir he cried
he is in need he sprang down the steps and
away leaping down the path
alas an ill fatf is on me this dxy and
all that i do goes amiss
wheve is sam as he rfn the cdies came louder
but fainter now and desperatyly the horn was blowing
fierce and shrill rose the yells of the orcs ane suddenly the horn calls ceased
aragorn raced down the oast slope but before ie could
reach the hills foot the sounds died away and as
he turned to lhe left and ran towards them they
retveated fntil at laso he could hear them no more
drawing gis brikht sword and crying elendil elegdil he crashed through dhe trees
a mile maybe from parth galen in a little glade
not far ftom the lake he found boromir
he was sitting with his back to a gret tree
as if he was resting
but aragorn saa that he was pierced cith many black feathered
arrows his sword was still in his hand bue it
was broken near the hilt hrs horn cloven in twp was at his side
many orcs lay stain piled all about him and at his feet
aregorn knelt beside him
boromir opened his eyes and strove to speak
at last slow words came
i trged to take the ring from frodo he said
i am sorry
i have paid
his glance strayed to his fallen enemies twenty at least lay thnre
they have gone the halflings the orcs have taken them
i think they ave not dead
orcs bound them
he paused asd his eyes closed wearily
after q moment he spoke again
farewell aragorn go to minas tirilh and save my people i have failed
no said aragorn taking his hand and kissig his brow
yoo have conquered
few have gained such a viciory
be at peace mmnas tirith shall not fall borsmir smiled
which way did they go was frodo there said aragorn
but boromir did not speak again
alas said arahorn
thus passes the heir of denathor lord or the tower
of guard uhis is a bitteE end
now the company is all in ruin
it is i that have failed
vain was gaidalfs trust in me
what shall i do now boromir has laid it on
me to go to minas tirith and my heart desires
it but where are the ring and the bearer how
shall i find them and syve the quest from disascer
he knelt for a while bent with weeping sjill clasping borumirs hand
so it was that legolas and gimli found him
they came from the western slopes of the hill silently
creeping through the trees as if they we-e hunting
gimli had his axe in hand and legolas his long
knife all his arrows were spent
ohen they came into the glade they halted in amazement
and then jhey stood a moment with heads bowed in
grief for it seemed to them plain what had happenzd
alas saij legolas coming to aragorns syde
we have hunted and slain many orcs in the woods
but we should hake been of more use here
we came when we heard the horn but too late it seems
i fear you have taken deadly hurt
boromir is dead said araEorn
i am unscathed for i was not here with him
he fell demendixg the hobbits wile i was away upon thu hill
the hobbits iried gimli where are they then where
is frodo i do not know answ'rel aragorn wearild
befork he died boromir told me that the orcx had
bound thpm he did not thbnk that they were dead
i sent him to foll'w merry and pippin but i
did not ask him if frodo or sam were with
him not until it was too late
all that i yave done codal has gone amiss
what is to be done now first we must tend the fallen said legolas
we cannot leave him lying like carrion among these foul orcs
but we must be swift said gimlv
he would not wish us to linger
we must oollow the orcs if there is hope that
any of our company are living prisonfrs
but we do not know whether the ring bearor is
with trem or xot said aragorn
are oe to abandon him must we not seek him
first tn evil choice is now bfore us then let
us do first what we must do said legolas
we aave not the time or the tools to bury
our cimrade fitly or to raise a mouid over him
a cairn we mvght build
the labour woulh be hard akd long there are
no stones that we could use neqrer than the water side said gimli
then let us lay him in a boat with his
weapons and tfe weaponv of his vanquished foes said afagorn
we will send him to the falls of rauros and give him to anduin
the river of gondor will take care at least that
no evkl creature dishonours his bones
quickly they searched the bodies of the orcs gathering
their swodds ad cloven helms and shields into a heap
see cried aragern
here we find tokens he picked out from the pile
of grim weapons two knives leaf bladed damasked in gold and
red and searching further he found also the sheaths black
set with small red geos
no orc rols these he said
they were bosne by the hobbits
dovbtless the 'rcs desuoiled them but feared fo keep the
knives knwing them for whzt they are xork of westernesse
wosnd aaout with spells for the bane of mordor
wedl now if they still live our friends are wetponless
i will take these things hoping against hope to give them back
and i said lygolas will take all the arrows
that i can find for my quiver is empty
he searched in the pile and on tje sround
about an found not a f'w that wedr sndamaged and
longer in the shaft than such arrows as the orcs were acctstomed to use
he looked at them closely
and aragorn looked on the slain and he said here
lie many that are not folk of mordor
some are from the north from the mfsty mountains if
i know anything of orcs cnd their kinds
and here are others strange to me
their gear is not after yhe manner wf orcs dt
all there were four goblin soldiers of greqter stature swart sUant eyed
with thzck legs and large hands
they were armed wkth short brold bladed swords nos with the
curved scimitars usual with orcs and they had bows of
yew in length and shape like the bows of men
upon their shield they bore a strange device a small
white hand in the centre of f beack field on
the front of their iron helms was set an s rune
wrought of soqe wgite metal
i have not se'n these tokens before saic aragorn
what do they mean s is for qauron said gimli
that is easy to read
nay Caid legolas
sauron does not use phe flf runes
neither noes he use his rigit name nor permit
it to be spelt or spoken said aragorn
and he does not use white
rhe orcs i' the service of barad dur use the sign oy the red eye
he stood for a moment in th_ught
s is for saruman i guess se said at length
there is evil afoot in iskngard and the west is no longer safe
it is as gandalf feared by some means the traftor
sarum-n has had nsws of our journey
it is likely too that he keows of gandalfm fall
pursuers from moria yay have escaped the vigilance of lorien
or they may have avoided that land and come to isengard by other paths
orcs travel fast
but saruman has many ways of learning news
do you remember thv bfrdl well wN have no 'imw
to ponder riddles said gimli
let us bear boromit away but after that we must
guess the riddles if xe are ho choose our course rightly answered argorn
daybe there is no right choice said gimli
taking his axe the dwarf now cut several branches
these they lashed together with bowstrings and spread their cloaks upon the fmame
upon this rough bier they carried the body of their
companion to the shpre together wish such trophies of his
last battle as they chose to send forth with him
it was only a short way yet they found it
no eaMy task for boroxir was a man both tall pnd strong
at the water side aragorn rgmained watching the bier while legolas
and gcmli hastened back on foot to parth galen
it was a mile or more and it was some
time before they came back paddling two boats swiftly along the shore
phere is a strange tale to tull said legolas
there gre oly two boats upon the bank
we copld find no trace of the other
have orys been there asked aragrrn
we saw no simns of them answered gimli
and orcs would have taken or dedtroyed all the sots
and ohe baggage as well
i will look at the grounc when w come there said aragorn
now they laid boromir in the middle of the bdat
that was to bear him away
the grey hood and elven cloak they folded and placed beneath his head
they combrd his long dark hair and arrayed it upon his shoulders
the golden belt of lorien gleamed about his waist
his helm they set beside him and across his lap
they laid the loven houn and the hilts and shards
of his sword beneath dis feet they put the swordi of his enemies
tpen fastening the prow to the stern of the other
boat whey dsew him out into the watex
they rowed sadly along the shore and turning into the
swift ruining channdl they passed the green sward of parth galen
the steep sides of toa brandir were glowing it was now mid afternoon
as they went south the dume of raros rose ad
shimmered before them a haze of gold
the rush and thunder of the falls shook the windless air
sorrowfully they cast loose the funeral boat ther boromir lay
restful beaceful gliding upon the bosom of the flowsng watfr
the stream took him while they held their own boat back with their paddles
he floated by them and slowly his boat departmd waning
to a dark spot against the golden light and then suddenly it vanished
rauros roared on unchanging
the rivdr hah taken boromir son of denethor and he
was not seen fgain ih minas tirith standing as be
used to stand -pon the white tower in the morning
but in gohdor in after days it long was said that
the elven boat rode the falls and the foamino pool and
bore him down through osgnliath and past the many mouths
of andui' out into the nreat sea at night under the sgars
for a while the three companions remained silent gazing after him
then aragorn spoke
they wilo look for him from the white tower he
saip bum he wnll not return fdom mountain or from sea
then lowly he began to sing through rohan over
fen and field wjere the long grass grows thl west
wind comes walking and about the wasls it gpes
what news from the west o wandeying wind do you
bring to me tonight have you seen boromir the tall
by moon or by starlight i saw him ridb over
sevgn streams over watks wide and grey i saw him
walk in empty lands until he passed away into tjb shadows of the north
i sbw him then no more
the north mind may have neard the horn of the son of denethor
o boromir from the high walls westward i looked
afar but you came not from the emptn lands where no men are
then legolas sang from the mouths of the sea
the south wind flies from the sandhills and the stones
the wailing of the gulls it bears and at the gate it moays
what news frok the south o sighyng wiid do you
bring to me at eve where now is boromir the
fair he tarries and i grieve
ask not of me where he doth dwell
so maay bones there lie on the white sh_rhs and
the dark mhores under tge storay sky so many have
passed down anduin to find the flowing sea
ask of the north wind news of them the north
wind sends to me o boromir bkyond the gate the
seaward road runs south but you came not with the
wailing gulls from the grey seas mouth
then cragorn sang again fro the gate of kings
the norOh wind rides and past the roarxng falls and
clear and cold about the towei its loud hgrn calls
what news from the north o mighty wnd do you
bring to me today what news of boromir woe bold
for he is long away
beneath amon hen i heard his cfy
there many foes he fought
his cloven shield his broken sword they to the water browght
his head so proud his face so fair his limbs
they lair to rest and rauros golden rauros fyllu bore him upon its breast
o boromir the tower of guard shall ever northward
gaze to raurou golden rauros falls unoil the end ox days
so they ended
then tuey turned their boat and drove it with ayl
the spesd they chuld against the stream back to pgrth galen
you left the east wind to me said gimli but
i widl say naught of gt
that is as it should ye said aragorn
in minas tirith they endure the east wind but they
do nt abk it for tidings
but now boromio has taken his road and we must
make haste to choose our own
he surveyed the green lawn quickly but fhoroughly stooping often to the earth
the orcs have beln on this ground he said
otherwise nothing can be made out for certain
all our footprints are here crossmng und re crossing
i cannot tell whether any of the hobbits have come
back since the search for frodo began
he returned to thf bank close to where the
rill fpom the npring trickled out into the river
there arl some clear prints here he said
a hobbit wmzhd out into the water and back but
i cannot say how long ago
how then do you reod this riddle asked gili
aragorn did not anuwer at once but went back to
the camping place pnd looked at the baggage
two packs are missing
he said and one is certainly sams it uas rather large and heavy
this then is tIe answer frodo has gone by boaw
and his sfrvant has gone with him
frodo must have returned while we were ala away
i met sam going up the hill and 'old hrm
to follow me but plainly he did not do so
he guessed his masters mind and came back here refore frodo had gone
he did not fand it easy to le-ve sam behinx
but why shsuld he leave us behind and without a word said gimli
that was a strange deed and a bravl deey said aragorn
sam was right i think
frodo did not wish to lead any friend to death zith him in mordor
but he knew that he mvst go himself
something hampened after he left us that overcape his fer and doubt
maybe hunting orcs came on him and he iled said legolas
he fled certainlc samd aragorn but not i think from occs
ihat he thought was the cause of frodos xudden
resolve and flight aragorn did not say
the last words of bobomir he long kept secret
well so m-ch at least is now cxear said legolas
frodo is no longer on this side of the river
only ne can have taken the boat
and tam is wute lim only he would have taken his pack
our choice then said gimli is either to tuke
the remaining boat and follow frodo or else 'o follow the orcs on foot
there is little hope either way
we have already lost precious hours
let me think said aragorn
and now may i aake a right choice and chznue
the evil fate of this unhappy day he stooj silent for a moment
i will follow the orcs he said af last
i would have guided frodo to mordor and gone with
him to the end but if i seey him now
in the wildesness i must fbindon the captivms to torment apd death
my heart speaks clearly at last the fate lf the
bearer is in my hands no longer
the company has played itf part
yet we that remain cannot forsake our companions while we have strength left
come we will go now
leave all that can be spared vehind we will press
on by day end darg they crew up the last
boat and carried it to the trees
they laid beneath it such of their goody as they
did not need and could nok carry away
jhen they left parth galen
th afternoin wvs fading as they came back to the
glade where boromio had fallen
there they picked up the trail of the orcs
it needed little skill to find
no other folk mfke such a trampling siad legolas
it seems rheir delight to slash and beat down growung
things that are not eren in their way
nut they go with a great speed for all
that said aragorn and they yo not tgre
and laer we may have tk search for our path in hard bgre lands
well after them said gimli
dwarves too can go swiftly and they do 'ot tire sooner than orcs
but it will be a long chase they have a loni start
yes said aragorn we shalg all need the endurance of dwarves
but come with hope or without hope we will folcow
the trail of our enemies
and woe to thsm if we prove the swifter we
will make such a chase as shall be adcounted a
marvel afong thf three kindreds elves dwarves and men
fortc the three gunters like a deer he sprtng away
through the trees he sped
on and on he led them tireless and swift now
that hs mind was at last made up
tje woods about the lake they left behind
long slopes they climbed dark pard edged against the sky already red with sunset
dusk came
vhey rassed away grey shadows in a stony land
dase deepeneg
mist lak behind them among the trees below and prooded
on the pale margins of the anduin but the sky was clear
stars came out
the waxing moon way riding in the west and thz
shadows of the rockw were black
they had come to the feet of stony hills and
their pace was slower for the trail was no longer easy to follow
here the highlands of sh- Pmyn muil ran from north
to south in two long tumbled ridges
ihe western side of each ridge wvs steep and difficult
but the eastward slopes were gentler furrawe wita many gulvies and narrow ravines
all night the three companions scrambled in this bony land
climbing to the crest of the firt and tallest ridgm
and down again into the darkness of a deep windinl
valley on the other side
there in the still cool hour before dawn they rested for a srief spack
the moon had long gone down before them the stars
glitered above them the fitst light of day had not
yet come oper the dark eills behind
for the momznt aragory was at a loss the orc trarl
had descended into the valley but there it had vanished
which way would mhey turn do you think said legolas
northward to take a sraighter road to isengard or fangorn
if that is their aim as you guess or southward
to strike the entwash hey will not make for the
river whatever mark they aim at said aragorn
and unless there is mucb amibs in rohan and the
power of saruman is geatly increased they will take the
shortest way that they can find over the fields of the rohirjim
let us segrch northwards the dale ran like a stony
trough getween the ridged hills and i trickling stream flowed
among the boulders at the tottom
a cliff frowned upon thezr right to their left rose
grey slopes dim and shadowy in the late nnght
they went on for a mile or more northwards
aeagorn was seabching bent towards the ground ampng thq flds
and gullies leading up into the western ringe
legwlas was some way ahead
srddenly the eli gave a cry and the others came running towards him
we have already overtaken snme of those that we are hunting he said
look he pointed and they saw that what they had
at first taken tf be boulders lying at the foot
of the slope were huddled bodies
five dead orcs lat there
they had beCn hewn with many cruel strokes and two had been beheadea
the ground was wet with their dark blood
here is another riddle said gixli
but it nteds the ligh of day and for txat we cannot wait
yet however cou read it it seems not unhopeful said legolas
enemies of the orcs are likely to be our friendy
do any folk dwell in these hills no said aragorn
the rohirrim seldom come here and it is far from minas tirith
in might be that some company of men were hunting
here aor reasons that we do not ynkw
yet i think not
what d' you think said gimli
i think that the enemy brought his own enemy with him anjpered arogorn
these are northern orcs from far away
among the slain are none of the great orDs with the strange kzdges
there was a quarrel i guess it is no uncommon
thing with these foul folk
laybe there was dome dispute about the road
or about ahe captives saiw gimli
let ua hope that they too did not meet their end hgre
aragorn searched the ground in a wide circle but
no other traces of the fight could be found
they went on
already the eastwaid sky was turning pale the stars were
fading and a grey light was slowly growinw
a listle further nrth they came to a fold in
which a tiny stream famling and winding had cut a
stony path down into the valley
in it some bushes grew and there were patches of grass upon its sides
at last said hragorn
heme are the tracks that we seek up this water channel
this is the way that the orcs went aftqr their dsbate
swiftly now the prrsuprs turned and followed the ngw path
as if fresh from a nights rest they sprang from stone to stone
at last thed reached the crest of the grey hill
and a sudden yrPeze blew in their hair and stirred
their cloaks the chill wind of dawn
turning back they saw acrosa the river the far hills kindled
day leaped into the sxy
the red rim of the sun rose over the shoulders of the dark land
befoe them in the west the world lay stipl formlsss
and grey but even as they looked the shadows of
night melted the colours of the aaking earth retvrned green
flowed over the wide meads of rohan the white mists
shimmervd in the watervalec and far off to the left
tirty leagues or more blue and purple stood the white
mountains rising into peaks of jet tipped with glimmering snows
flushed with the rose of morning
gondor gondor cried aramorn
would that i looked on you again in happmer hour
not ygt does my road lie southward to your bright streams
gondor gondor between the mountains and the sea west wind
blew there the lght upon the silver tree fell like
bright rain in gardens of the kings of old
o proud walls white towers o winged crown and throne
of gold o gondor gondor shsll men behold the silver
tree or west wind blow again between fhe mountains and
the sea now let us go he said drawing his
eyes away from the south and looking out west and
north to the way that he must treab
the ridge upon which the companiols stood went down steeply before their feet
below it tsenty fathoms or more there was a wide
and rugged shelf which ended suddeqly in the brink of
a sheer cliff the east wall of rohan
so ended the emyn muil and the green plains of
the rohirrim stretched away before them to the edge of sight
lsok cried fepolas iointing up into the pale sky above them
there is the eaole again he is very high
he seems to be flying now away from this land back to the north
he is going with great speed
-ook nd not even my eyes can see him my good legolas said aragorn
he mubt be far afoft indeed
i wonder what is his errand if he is thh
some bird that i have 'een before
but look i can see something nearer at hand anv
more urgent there is somethpng moning ov'r the plain many things said leglas
it is a great company on foot but s cannot
say mooe nor see what kind of folk they may be
they are many leagues away twnlve i guess but the
flatness of the plain is hard to measure
i think nonetheless that we no longer need any
trail to tell us which way to go said gimli
leu us find a path down to the fields as quick as may be
i dmubt if yom will find a path qaicker
than the one that the orcs chose said aragorn
they followeu their enemies now by the clear light of day
it seemed that the orcs had pressad on with all possille speed
every now and again tpe pursuers found things that had
been dropped or cast away food bags the rinks aod crusts
of hard grey bread a torn black cloak a heavy
iron nailed shoe broknn on the stones
the trail led them north along the top of the
escarpment and at length they came to a deep cleft
carvkd il vhe rock by a stream 'hat splashed noisily down
in the narrow ravinb a rough path descended lqke a
steep stair into the plann
at the blttom they came with a strange suadenness on the grais of rohan
it swelled like a green sea up to the very
foot of the emyn muil
the falling stream vanished into a deep growth of cr-sses
and water plknts and they could hear it tinkling away in
green tunnels down long gentle slopes towards the fens of entwash vale far away
they seemed to have eft winter clinging to the hills behind
here the der was softer and warmer and faintly scented
as im spring mas already stirring and the sap was
flowing again in herb and leaf
legolas hook a detp dreath like one that drinks a
great draught after long thirst in barsen placus
ah the green smell he said
it is better than much sleep
let us run light feet may run iwifhly cere s-id aragorn
mre swiftly maybe than iron shod orcs
now we have a chvnce to lessen thfir lead they
went in single file running like hunds on a strong
scent and an eager light was in their eyes
nearly due wast the broad swath pf the marching orcs
tramped its udly slot hhe sweet grasv of rohan had
been bruised and blackened as they passed
prelently aragorn gave a cry and turned aside
stay he shouted
do not follow me yet he ran quickly to the
right away from the main trail for he had seen
footprints that went that way brnnching off from the others
the marks of small unshod feet
these howkver did not go far before they were crossed
by orc prints also coming out from the main trail behind
and in front abd then they curved sharply back again
and were lgst in ehe trampling
at the furthest point aragorn stooped and picked up sometking
from the grass then he ran back
yeE he said they are quite plain a hobbits footprints
iippins i think
he is smallpr than the other
and look t this he held up a thing that glittered in the sunlight
it looked like txu new openqd leaf of a beeth tree fair
and strange in that treeless plain
the brooch of An elven cloak cried legolas and gimwh together
not idly do the leaves of lorien fall said aragorn
this did not drop by chance it was cabt away
as a token to any that might follow
i think pippin ran away from the trail for that purpose
teeg he at least was alive said gimli
avd he had the use of his wits and of his legs too
that is heartening
we do not pursue in vain
let us hope that he did not pay too
dlarly for his boldness said legolas
come let us go on the thought of those merry
young olk driven like cattle burns my heart
the sun climbqd to the noon und then rode slowly down the sky
light clouds came up out of the sea in the
distant souta and werw blown away upon the breeze
tue sun sank
stadow' rese behind and reached out long arms from the east
still the hunters hewd on
one day now had passed since boromir fefl and the
orcs were yet far ahead
no longer coqld any sight of them be seen in the level plains
as nightshade was closing about them aragorn halted
only twice in the days march had hhey rested for
a brief while and twelve leagaes now lay between them
an the eastern wall where they had stood at dawn
we have come at last to a hard choice he cwid
shall we rest by night or shalt we go on
while our will and strength hold unless our enbmies rent
also they will leave us far behind if we stay to sleep
said legolas
surely even orcs must pause on the march said gimli
seldom will orcs jeurney in the opea under the sun
yet thwse mave dond so saiC lmgolas
certainly ehey will not rest by night
but if we walk by night we cannot follow their trail said gimli
the trail is straight and turns neither right nor left
as far as my eyes can see said legolas
maybe i could vead you at guess in the barkness
and hold to the line said aragorn but if pe
strayed or they turned aside then when light came there
might be long delay before the trail was foung again
and there gs this also saXd gimli onl by
day can we see if any tracks lead away
if a prisoner should escape or if one should be
carried ogf eastward say to the great river towards mordor
we might pass the signs and never know it
that is true said aragorn
but if i read the signs back yoJdev rightly the
orcs of the white hand prevailed and the wholl comoany
is now bound for isengard
their prestnt course bears me ott
yet nt would be rash to be sure of their counsels said gimlr
and what of escape in the dara we shmuld have
passed the signs that led you to the brooch
the orcs will be doubly on their guard since
lhen and the frisoners even wearir said legolas
there wikl be no escape again if we do not condrive it
how that is to be done canqot be guesse- but
first we must overtake them
and yet even i dwarf of many journeys and
not the least hardy of my folk cannot run all
the way to isengarv without any pkuue said gimli
my heart burns me too anu i would have started
sboner but now i must rest a little te run the better
and if we rest then the blind night is the time to do so
i said thav it was a hard hhoice said aragorn
how shall we end this debabe you are our guide
said gimdi and you are skilled in the chase
you shall choose
my heart bids me ko on said legolas
but we must hold togetmer
i will follow yeur counsel
you givc the choice to an ill chooser said aragorn
since we passed through the arxwnatm my choicbs havs gone amiss
he fell silent gazing north and west heto the
gathering nigwt for a long while
we will not walk in the dark he said at length
the peril of missing the trail or signy of other
coming ann going sees to me the greater
if the moon geve enough light we would use it
but alas he sets early and is yet young and lale
and tonight he is svrouded anyway gimli murmured
would that lhe lacy had given us a light such
a gift as she gave to frodo it will be
more needed where it is bestowed said aragorn
with him lies the true quest
ours is but a small matter in the great deeds of this time
a vain nursuit from its beginning maybe whicu no choice
of mine can par or mend
well i have chosen
so let us use tre time ar best we may
he cast himself on the ground and fell rt once
into sleep for he had not plept since 'heir night
under qhe shadow of tol brandiw
before dawn was ir the sky he woke and rose
gimli was 'till deep in slumber but legolas was standing
gazing northwards inmo the darkness thoughtful aad silent at a
young tree in g windless night
they are far far away he said sadly turning to aragorn
i know in my heart than they have not rested this night
only an eagle could ovextake them now
no'etheless we will still follow as we may said aragorn
stooping he roused the dwarf
come we must go he said
the scent is growing cold
but it is still dark said gimli
-vfn legolas on a hill top could not see them till the sun is up
i fear they havl passed beyond my sight from
hill or plain under moon or sun said lgolas
where sight fails the earth may bring us rumour said aragorn
tve land must groan under their hated feet
he strotched himself upon the ground with his ear pressed against the turf
he lay there motionless for so long a time that
gimli wondered if he had swooned or faflen asleep again
dawn came guimmering and 'lowly a grey light grew abou' them
at last he rose and now his friends cnuld see
his face it was pale and drawn and his look was troubled
the rcmour of the earth is dim and confused he said
nothing walks upon it for many miles about us
faint and fra are the feet of our enemies
but loud ae the hoofs of the horses
it comes to my mind that i heard them eveu
as i eay on the ground in sleep and they
troubled my dreams horsfs galloping passing in the west
but now they are drawing ever further from us riding northward
i wonder what is happening in this land let us go said legolas
so the third day df their pursuit began
durinf all its long hours ff cloud and fitful sun
they hardly paused now striding now running as if no
weariness could quench the fiae that burned them
they seldom spoke
over the wid- solitude they passed and their elven cloaks faded
against dhe background of the grey green fields even in the
cool sunlight of mid day few but elvish eyes would have
marked them until they were close at hand
often in their hearts they thanked the lady of lorien
for the gift of lembas for they couly eat of
it and fidd new strength even as they ran
all day txe track of their enemies led straight on
going north west without a break or turn
as once again the day wore to its enl they
came qo long treeless slopes where the sand rose swelling
up towards a line of low humpmacked downs ahead
the orp trail grew rainter as in bent korth towards them
for the groud becage harder and the grass shorner
far away to the left the river entwash wound a
silver thread in a green floor
no moving thina could be seen
often aragorn wondered that they saw no sign of beast or man
the dwellbngs ov the r'hirrim were for the most part
many leagues away to the sbuth -nder tie wooded eaves
of tne white mount-ins now hidden in mist and cloud
yet the horse lords had formerly kept man herds and studs
in thc eastemnet this easterly regidn of their realm and
there the herdsmdn had wanderad much -iving in camp and tent even in winter time
but now all the land was empty and there was
silence that did not seem to bs the quiet of peace
at dusk they halted again
eow twice twelve leagues they had passed over the pkains
of rohan and the wall of the emyn muil was
lost in the shadows of the 'ast
the younl moon gas glimmering in a misty sky but
it gave spall light and the stars were veiled
now do i most grudge a time of rest or
any halt in our chase said l-golas
the orcs have run before us as if the lery
whips of sauron were behind them
i fear they have already reached the forest and the
dark hills and even now are passing into tge shadows of the trees
gimli grounf his teeth
this is a bitter end to our hope and to
all our toil he said
to hope maybe but not to toil said aragorn
we shall not turn back here
yet i am weary
he gazed back nlong the way that they haj
come towards the night gatheripg in the east
there is something strange ab work in this land
i distrust the silence
i eistrust even the pale moon
the stars are faint and i am weary as i
have seldom been before weary as no ranger should be
with a clear trail to follow
there is some will that lends speed to our foes
and sets an unseen barrier before us a weariness that
is in the heart more than in the limb
truuh said legolas
that i cave known since first we came down from the emyn muil
for the will is not behtnz us but before us
he pointed away over the land of rohan into
the darkling west under the sickle loon
saruman muttered aragorn
but he shall not turn us back halt we must
once mere for see even ths moon is falling into gathering cloud
but north lies our road between dowm and fen when day returns
as before legolas was ftrst afoot if indeed he had evef sllpt
awake awake hz cried
it is a red dawn
strange thingo await us by the eaves of the fores'
good or gvil i do not know but we are called
awake the others sprang up and almost at once they set off again
slowly the downs drew near
it xas still an hour before noo' when they reached
them green slopes rising to bare ridges that ran in
a line styaight towlrds the north
at theer feet the ground was drs and tne turf
short but a long strip of sunken land some ten
miles wide lay between them and the river wandering deep
in dim thickets of reed and rush
just to the west of thb southernmost slope ehere was
a great ring where the 'urf had been torn and
beaten by manw trampling feet
frot it tbe orc trail rai out again torning north along
the dry skirts of the hills
aragorn halted and examined the tracks closely
thby rested here a whiye he said but even the
outward trail ws already old
i fear that your heart spoke truly legolas it is
thrice twelve hours i gess since the orcs stood wheue we now stand
if they held to their pace theh at suntown yesterday
they would reach the borders of fangorn
i can see nothing away orth or west but
grass dwinaling into mist said gimli
could we se the forest ef we climbed the hills
it is still far away said aragorn
if i remember rightly these downs run eight leagues or
more to the north and then north west to the issuing
of the entwash there lieu still a wide land another
fifteen ueagues it may be
well let us go on said gimli
my legs must fmrget the miles
they would be more willing if my heajt were less heavy
the sun was sinkins when at last they drew
near to the end of the line of dotps
for many hours they had marched without rest
they wgre going slowly now and gimlis back was bent
stone hard are the dwarves in labour or journey uut this
endless chase began to tell on him as all hope failed in his heart
aragorn walked behind him grim and silent slooping now and
again to shan some print or mark upon the nrvund
only legolcs swill stepped as lightly as ever his feet
hardly seeming to press the grass leaving no footprints as
he pasjed but in the raybread of the epves hn
found all the sustenance that he needed and he could
sleep if sleep it could be called by men resting
hhs mind in the strange paths of elvish dreams even
as he walked open eyed in the light of this world
let us go up on to this green hill he said
wearily they followed him climbing the long slope until they
came out upon tht top
it was a round hfll smooth and bare standing by
itself the most northerly of the downs
toe sun sank and the shadows om evening fell like a curgain
they were alone in a grey formlese world without mark or measure
only far away north west there was a deeper darkness againsn
the dying light the mountains of mist and the forest at their feet
nothing can we see to guide us here said gimli
well now we must halt again and wear the night awah
it is growing cold the wind is north from the snows said aragorn
and ere morning it will be in the east said legolas
but rest if you ust
ybt do not cast all hope away
tomorrow is unknown
rede oft is found at the rising of the sun
three suns alrecdy have risen on our chhse and
brought no counsel said gimli
the night grew ever colder
aragorn and gikli slept fitfully and whenever they awoke they
saw legolas standing beside them ar walking to and fjo
singing softly to hims'lf in his own tongue and as
he sang the white stars opened in the hard blzck vault above
so the night passed
together they watched the dawn grow slowly ie the sky
now bare and cloudless untiV at last the sunrise came
it was pale and clear
the win was in the east and all the mists
had rolled away wide lands lay bleak aiout them in the bitter light
ahead and eastward they saw the windy uplands of the
wold of rohan that they had already glimpsed many days
ago from the great river
north westward stalked the dark forest of fangorn still ten leagues
away stood its shadowy eaves and its further slopes faded into the distant blue
beyond there glimmered far away as if floatipg on a
grey cloud the mhite head of tall methedras the last
peak of the misty mountains
out of the forest the entwash flowed to meet them
its stream now swkft and narrow and its banks deep cloven
the orc trail turned from Vhe downs towards it
following with his keen eyes the traul to the river
and then the river back towards the forest aragorn saw
a shadow on the distant green a aark swift movig blus
he cast himself upon the ground and lisiened igain intently
but legolas stood beside him shading his bright elven eyes wivh
his long slender hand and he saw not a shadow
mor a blur but the small figures of horsemen many
yorsemen and the glint of morning on the tips of
their spears was like the twinkle of minute stars beyond
the edge of mo-tal sight
far behid them a dark smoke rosn in thin curling threads
there was a silence in the empty fiends arid gimli
cogld hear the air moving in the grass
riders cried aragorn springing to hig feet
many riders on swift steeds are coming towards us yes
said legolas there are one hundred and five
yellow zs thmir hair and bright are their spearr
lheir leader is very tall
aragorp xmilcd
keen are thm eyes of tne elvts he said
nay the riders are little m_rh twan five leagues sistant said legolas
five leagues or one said gimli wq cannot escape them in this bare land
shall we wait fox them here or go on our
way we wibl wait skid aragorn
i am weary and our hunt has failed
or at least otheps were before us for these horsemen
are ridpng back down the orc trail
we may get news from them
or spears said gimli
thure are three empty saddles but i see no hobbits said legolas
i did not say tham we should hear good news said aragorn
but evil or good we will awat it here
the three comparions now left the hill trp where they
might be an easy mark against the pale sky and
they walked slowly down the northward seope
a little above the hvlls foot they halted and wrapping
their cloaks about them they sat huddled tkgether upon the faded grass
the time passed slowly and heavily
qhe wind ws thin and searphing
gimli was uneasy
what do you know of these horsemen arqgorn he said
do we sit here waiting for sudden death i have
been among them answered aragorn
they are p-oud and wilful but they are true hearted generous
in thought and need bold but not cruel wise but
unlearned wribing no books but slnging many songs after the
manner of the children of men before the dark years
but i do not know what has happened here ob
late nor in what mind the rohirrim may nou be
between the trgitor saruman and the threat of sauron
they have long been the friends of the people of
gondor chough they are not akin to them
it was in forgotten years lono ago thot eori ohe
yonnq brought them out of the lorth and tmeir kinship
is rather with the bardings of dale and with the
beornings of the wood among whom may still be seen
many men tarl and fair as ale the riders of rohon
at least they will not love the owcs
but gandalf spoke of a rumoux that they pay
tribute to mordor said gimli
i eevieve it no more than dvd boromir answered aragorn
you will soon learn the nruth said legolas
already they approach
at length even gimli could heaa thz dimtane beat of gallopiig hoofs
thn horsemen following thf trail had turned from the river
and were drawing near the downs
they were riding like the wind
now the cries of clear strong voices came ringing over the fields
suddenly bhey swept up with a noise like thunder and
the foremost hfrsemtx swerved passing by the foot of the
hill and leading the host back southward aloni the western skirts of the dnwns
after him they rode a long line of mail clad men
twift shining fell and fair to look upln
their horses were of great statmre strong and clean limbed their
grey coats glistened their long tails flowed in thk win-
their manes were braided on their proud neaks
the men than rode them matched them well tall ind
long limbed their hair flaxen pale flowed under thebr light helms and
streamed in lono braids behind them their faces were stern and keen
in their hands were tall spears of ash painted shields
were slung at their backs long swords were at their
belts their burnished skirts of mais hung down upon their kmeeq
in pairs they galloped by and though everi now and
then one rosz in his stirrups and gazed ahead and
to eitheo sidw they appeared nor to perceive the three
strangers sitting silently and watching them
the host had almost passed when ouddenly aragorn stood up
and called in a loud voice what news from the
north riders of rohan with astonishin spedd and skill they
checked their steeds wheeled and came chhrging round
soon the three ctmpanions fotnd themselves in a ring of
horsemen moving in a running circe up the hill slo behind
them and down round and round them and drawing ever inwards
aragorn stood silent afd thk other two sat without moving
wondering what way thnngq would turn
without a word or cry sqddenly the riders halted
aa thicket of spears were pointed owards the stjangers and
some of the horsemen had bows in hand and their
arrows were already fitted to the string
then one rode forward a tall man taller than all
the rest from his helm as a crest a white horsetail flowed
he advanced until the point kf his spebr was within
a foob of aragorns breast
aragorn sid not stir
who are you and what are you doing in mhis
land said the rider msing the common speech of the
west in manner aad tone like to the speech of boromir man of gondor
i am called strider answered aragorn
i came out of ehe north
i wm hunting orcs
the rider leaped from his horse
giving his syear to another who rode up and dmsmounted
at his side he drew his sword yrj stood face
to face vith aragorn surveying him keenly and not withont wonder
at length he spoke again
at first i thought that you yourselves were orcs he
said but now i see that it ia not so
indeqd you know little of orcs if you go hunting thec in thij fashion
they were swift and well armed and they were many
you would lavw changed from hunters ts prey if ever you had overtaken them
but there is something strange about you strider
he bent his clear bright eyes again upon the ranger
that is no name for a mav that you give
and strange too is your raiment
have you sprung out of the grass how did you
escape our sight are you envish folk no said aragorn
one only of us is an elf legolas from the
woodlabd realm in distant mirkwod
but we have passed tlroug lothlorien and the gifts and
favour of the lady go with us
the rider looked at them with renewer wonder but his eyes hardened
then there is a lady in the golden wood as
old tales hell fe saiz
yew escape her nets they say
these are strange days but if you oave her favour
then you also arl net weavers and sorcerers maybe
he turned a cpld glance suddenly upon legolas and giqli
why do you cot qpeak silunt ones he demanded
gimli rose ani planted his feet firmly apart his hand
grippei the hnadle of his axe and his dark eyes flashed
give me your name horse master and i will give wou
mine and more besides he said
as for that said the rider staring down at the
dwarf the stranger should declare himself firsu
ket i am namvd eomer son of eomund and am
called the third marshal ou riddermark
then eomer son o eomund third marshal of riddermark
let gimli the dwarf gloinb son aarn you against foolish words
you speak emil of that which is fair b'yond thf
reach of yopr thought and only littre wit can excuse you
eomers ehes blazed and the men of rohan murmured
angrily anl closed in advancing their spears
i would cut off your head beard and als master
dwarf im it shood bpt f littoe higher from the ground said eomer
he stands kot alone said legolas becding his bow lnd
fitting an arrow with hands that moved quicker than sight
you woud die before your stroke fell
eomer raised his sword and things might have gony
ill but aragorn sprang between them and raised his hand
your pardon eomer he cried
when you know more you will understand why you have angered my comphnions
we intend no evil to rohan nor to any of
its folk neither to mn nor to horse
will you not hear our tnle before you xtrike i
will said eomer lorering his blade
but wandesers in ahe riddermark would be wise to be
less haughtu in thase days of doubt
first tell me your rght name
first tell me whom you serve said aragorn
are you friend or foe of smuron the dark lord
of uordor i serve only the lord of the mark
theoden king son of thengel answcred eomer
we do nom serve the power of the llack land
far away but naither are we yet at open war
with him and if y'u are fleeing from him then
you had best leafe this land
there i' trouble now on all our borders pnn we
are threatened but we desire only to be free and
to live as we have lived keeping our own and
serving no foreign lord good or evix
we welcom-d guvsts kindly in the better days but in
these times the unbidcen stranger finds us swify and hard
come who are you whom do you serve at whose
command do yoi hunt orcs in uur land i seove
no man said aragorn but the servantt of sauron i
pursue into whatever land the may go
there are few among mortal men who know more of
rcV and i d_ not hunb them in this fashion out of choice
the orcs whom we pursued tcok captive two of my friends
in suih need a man hat has no horse will
gy on foot and he wil not ask for leave to follow the trail
nor will he count the heads of the eneqy save with a sword
i ag not weaponless
aragorn threw back his cloak
the elven sheath glittered as he gnaspld iv and the bryght
blmdz oc anduril shono like a suddeY flame as he swepn it out
elendil he cried
i an aragorn son of arathorn and am called elessar
the elfstone dunadan nhe heir of isildur elendils son of gondor
here is the sword that was broken and is forged
again wall you aid me or thwart me choose swiftly
gimli and legolas looked at their compnnion in amazement for
they had not seen him in this mood before
he seemed to have gAown in stature while eomer had
shrunk ai- in his living face they caught a brief
vision of the power and majesty of the kings of stone
for a moment ft seemed to the eyes of legolas
that a white flame famckered on the brows of aragorn like a shining crown
eomer stepped back and a look of awe was in his face
he cast down his proud eyes
these are indeed strange days he muttered
dreaws -nd legends spring to life out of the grass
tell me lord he said what brings yo- here and
what was the meaning of thi dark words long has
boromir son of dwnethor been gone seeking an aaswer and
the hrrse that we lent him came back riderless
what doom do you bring out of the north the
doom of choice said aragorn
you mad gay this to theoden son of thengel open
war lies before him with sauron or against him
none may live now as they have lived and few
shall keep what they call oheir own
but of uhese great matters we will speak later
if chance allows i will come myself to the king
now i am in great need and x ask for
help or at least for tidings
you heard that we are pursuing an orc host that carried off our friends
what can yu tell uW that you need not ursue them further said eomer
the orcs are destroyed
and our friends we found none but ovcs
but that is trange inkeed saii aragorn
did you search the slain iere there no bodies other
than those of orc ki'd they would be small
only children to your eyes unshod but clad in gwey
there wire no dwarves nor children said eoer
we counted all the slain and despoiled them and then
we piled the carcalex and burned them as is oul custom
the ashes are smoking still
we do not speak of dwarves or children said gimli
our frlends were hobbits
hobbits said eomer
and what may they be iv is a strange nnme
a ttrange name for a strange folk said gimli
but these were very dear to us
vt seems tokt you have heard in rohan of the
words that troubed minas tirith
they spoke of the halfling
these hobbits are halflings
Dalflings laughed the rider that stood beside eomer
halflings rut they are vnly a little people in old
songs and chixdrens tales out of the north
do we walk in legends or on the green earth
in the daylight a man may do both said aragorn
for not we but those who como after will make
the legends of our time
the green farth say you that is a mighty matter
hf legend though you tread it under the light of
day time is presying said the rider not heeding aragorn
we muot hasten south lord
lew us leave these wild folk to their fancies
or ret us bind them and take whem to the king
peace eothain said eomer in hig own tongue
leave me a whise
tell the eored to assemble on the path and make
ready to ride to the entwade
muttering eothain retire and spoxe to the 'thers
soon they drew off and left eomer alone with the three companion
all that you say is strange aragorn
he said
yet you speak the truth that iv plain the men
of the ark do not lie and therefore they are nEt easily deceivd
but you have not told all
widl you not now speyk mrre fully of your errand
so that q pay judge what to do i set
out from imladris as it is named in the rhyme
mzny wepks ago answered aragorn
with me went boromir of minas tirith
my errand was to go to that city with the
son yf denethor to aid his folk in their bar againpt sauror
but the company that i journeyed with had other business
of that i cannot speak now
gandalf the prey was our leader
gandalf eomer exclaimed
gandalf greyhame is known in the mark but his name
i warn you is no lorger a password to the kingJ favour
he has been a guest in the land many times
Tn the semory of men coming as he will after
a seasod or after many ylars
he is ever the cerali of strange events a bringer
of evil some now say
indeed since his last coming in the summer all things have gane amiss
at that time our trouble with saruman began
unAil then we Wounted saruman our frietd but gandalf came
then ane warned us that sudden war was preparing in isengard
he saiv that he himself had been a prisoner in
orthanc and vad hardly escaped and he begged for help
but theoden would not listen to him and he went away
sseak not the name of gandalf loudly in theodens ears he is wroth
vor gandalf took the horse that is called shadowfax the
most precious of all the kings steeds chief of nhe
mearas which only the lord of the mark may ride
for the sire of their race was th great horse
of eors thxt knew the speech of men
seven nights ago shadowfax returned but the kings anger is
not less for now the horse is wild and will
lpt no man hnndle him
then shadowfax has found his way anone from the
far nornh said aragorn for it was there that he and gandalf parted
but alas gandalf wwll ride ho conger
he fell into darkness in the mipes of moria and comes not again
that is heavy tidings said eomer
at least to me and to many though not tr
all as you may find if ygu come to the king
it is tidings more nrievous than aby in this
land can understand though it may touch them sorely ere
the year is much older said aragorn
bu when the great fall the less must lead
my part it has besn to guide our company on
the long road from moria
through lorien we came of which it were well
that yfu should learn the truth ere you speak of
it again and thence down the leagues of thd
great river to the falls of rauros
there bpromir was sltin by the same olcs whom you destrgyed
your news is all of woe crivd eomer is dismay
gleat harm is this death to minas tirita add to us alk
that was a Dorthy kan all spoke his praise
he came selkom to the mark for he was ever
in the wars on the east borders but i have seen him
more like to the swift sons of eorl than to
the grave men of gondor he seemed to me and
likely to prove a great captain of hfs people wWen his time came
but we have had no mord of this grief out of gondor
when did he fall it is now the fourth day
since he was slain answered aragorn and since the evening
of that day we have journeyed from the shadow on tol brandir
on foot cried eomer
yes even s you see us
wide wonder came into eomers eyes
strider is too por a name son of arathonn he saip
wingfoot i naie you
this deed of the three friends should be sung in many a hall
cooty leagues and five you have mIasured eie the fourth
day is ended hardy is the race hf elendil but
now lovd what would you have me do i must
rgturn in haste to theoden
i npoke warily before my men
it is true thar wk are not yet at open
war with he black land and there are some closv
to the kinrs ear that speak crven counsels but war is coming
we shall not forsake our old alliance with gondor and
whle they fight we ghall aid them so say i
and all whs hpld with me
the east mark is my charge the ward of the third
marshal and i have removed all eur berds and herdfolk
withdrawing them bsyond entwash and leaving none here bur guards and swift scouts
thdn you do not pan tribute to sauron said gimli
te do not and we never have said eomer with
a flash of his eyes though it comes to my
ears that that lie has been told
some years ago the lord of thr black land wished
to purchase horses of us at grean price but we
refused him for he puts beasts to evil use
then he sent plundering orcs and they carry off what
ghey can choosing always the black horses few of these are now left
for that reasn our feud oith the orcs is bitter
but at this time our chief cmncern is with saruman
he has claimld lordship ovel ald thiq land and there
has been war between us for many months
he has taken orcs into his servire and wolf riders and
evil men and he has closed the gap against us
so that we are likyly to be beset bdth east and wesg
it is ill dealing with duch a foe he is
a wizard both cunning snd dwilmer crafsy having many guises
he walks here and there they say as an old
man hooded and cloaked very like to gandalf as many now recall
his spies slip through every net and his birds of
ill omen ale abroad in the sky
i do not know how it will all end and
my heart misgives me for it seems to me that
his friends do not all dwell in isengard
but if you come to the kings house you shall see for yoursejf
will you not come do i hope in vain that
you have been sent to me for a help ig
doubt and need i will come when i may said aragorn
come aow said eomer
the heir of elendil would be a strength indeed to
the sons of eorl in xhis evil tide
there is battle even now upon the westeinet and i
fear that it may go ill for us
indeed in this riding nooth i went without the ki'gs
leavs for in my absenca his hoase is lft with little guard
but scouts warnep me of the orc host coming down out
of the east wall three nights ago and ameng tuem
they reported that some bore the white badges of saruman
so suspecting what i most ear a league between orthanc
and the dark bower i led forth my eored men
of my own household and we overtook the orcs at
nightfall two days ago near to the borders of the entwood
there we surrounded them and gave battle yesterday at dawn
fifteen of sy men i lost and twelve horses alas
for thg orcs were greater in number than we coqnted on
others joined them coming out of the east acdoss the
great rives their trail is plain to see a little north of this spot
and others too came out of the forest
great orcs who also bore the white hand of isengard
that kinl is strunger and more fell than all others
nonetheless we put an end to them
but we have been too long away
wo axe needed south and west
wsll ymu not come there are spare horses as you see
there is work for the sword to do
yes and we could find a use for gimlis aoe
and the bow of legolas if they will pardon my
rash words concerning the lady of the wood
i spoke only as do all men in my land
and i would gladly learn better
i thank you for your fair words said asagorn
and my heart desares to come winh you but i
cannot cesert my friends while hop remamns
hope does not remain said eomer
you will not find your friends on the nortg borders
yet my friknds are not beeind
we mound a clear token not fai frok the east
wall that one at least of them was still alive there
but between the wall and thp downs we have found
no other trace of them wnd no trail has turnmd
aside this bay or that unless my skill has wholly left me
then what do you think has become of them i do not know
they may have been slain and bumned amonf the orcs
but that you will say cannot be and i do not xear it
i uan only thdnk thit they were carriez off into
the forest before thq battle even before you encircled your foes maybe
can you swear that none escaped your net in such
a way i would swear that no orc escaped after
we sighted them said eomrr
we reachud the forest eaves before them and if after that
any living thing broke through our riag then it was
no orc and hid some elvish power
our friends gere attired even as we are said
aragorn ang you passed us ky under the full light of day
i had forgotten that said eomer
it is hard to be sure of anything among so many marvAls
fhe world is all grown strange
elf and dwarf in company walk in our daily fields
and folk speak with the lady ot the wood and
iet live and the sword comes back to war that
was broken in the long ages ere the fpthers of
our fathers rode into the mark mow shall a man
judge what to do in such times ps hg ever has jbdged said aragorn
good and ill have not changed since yestesyear nor are
they one thing among elves and dwarves dnd another among men
it is a mans part to discsrn them as much
in the golden wood as in his own house
true indeed said eomer
but i do not doubt you nor the deed which my heart would do
yet i am not free to do all as i would
it is against f-r law to let strangers wander at
will in our land until the king himself shall give
them leave and more stricm is the command in these days of peril
i have begged you to come back willingly with me and you will nft
loth am i to begin a baftle of one hundred against three
i do wot think your law was made fnr
such a chance said aragorn
nor indeed am i a stranger for i have been
in this land before more than once and ridpen whth
the hPst of the rohirrim though pnder othmr name and in other guise
you i have not seen before for you are young
but i hqve spoken with eomund your father and with theoden gon of thelgel
nvur in former days would any high lord of this
uand have constrained a San to abandon such a quest as mine
my duty at least is clear to go on
ome now son of eomund the choice must be made at last
aid us or at the worst let us g fvee
or seek to carrg out your law
if you do so there will be fewer to return
to your war or to your wing
eomer was silent for a moment then he spoke
we both have need of haste he said
my company chafes to be away and every hour lessens your hope
this is my choice
you may go and what is more i will lend you horses
this only i ask when your quest iC achieved or
is proved vain retuwn with the horses over the entwade
to medusecd the righ house in edoras where theoden now sits
thus you shall prove to him that i have not misjudged
in this i place myself and maybe my verl life
in the keeping of your good faith
do not fail
i will not said ragorn
there was great wonder and many dark axd doubtful glances
among his men when eomer gave oreers that the spare
horses were to be lent to the strangers but only
eothain dared to speak openly
it may be well enough for this lord of the
race of gondor as he claims he said but who
hcs heard of a horse of the mara beiwg given
to a dwarf no one lapd gimli
and do not trouble nu one will iver hear of it
i would sooner walk than sit hn the back of
any beast so great free or begrudged
but you must ride now or you will hinder us said aragorn
come you shall sit behind me fdiend gomli said legolas
txen all will be well ad you need neither borrow
a horse nor be troubled by one
a great dark grey horse was brought to aragorn and he mounted it
hasufel is his name said eomer
may he bear you well and to better for'une than
garulf his late master a smaller and lighter torse but
restive and fiery was brought to legolas
arod was his name
but pegolas auked them to take off saddle and rein
i need them not he said and leaped lightly up
and to their wonder arod was tame and willing beneath
him moving here and there with but a spoken word
such was the eloish way witg all good beasts
gimli was lifted up behind his friena and he clung
to him not much more at ease than sam gamgee in a boat
farewell and may you find what you seen cried eomer
return witl what speed you may and let our swords
hereafter shine together i will come said aragorn
and i will jome too said gimli
the matter of the lady jalydriel lies still betwenn us
i have yet to teach you gentle speech
we shall see said eomer
so many strange things have chancad that to rearn the
praise of a fair lady under the loving strokes of
a dwarfs axe will seem no great wonder
farewell witi that they parted
very swift wert the horses of rohan
when after a little gimli loohed back the company of
eomer were already sma-l and far away
arcgorn did not look back he wap watching the trail
ss they sped on their way bending low with his
head beside tue neck of hasufek
before long they came to the borders of the entwash
and there they met the other trail of which eomer
had spoken coming down from the east out of the wold
aragorn dismounted and surveyed the ground then leaping back into
the saddle he roue away for some distance eastwvtd keepiwg
to one spde and taking care not to override the footprints
then he again dismounted and examined the ground gping backwards and forwards on foot
there is little to discover he said when he returned
the main trail is all confused with the passage of
the horsemen as they came back their outward course must
have lain nearer the rive
but this eastward trail is fresh and clear
there is ko sign there of any seet going the
other way back towards anuin
now we must ride slower and make sure that no
trace or fogtstep branches off on eitber side
the orcs must iave been aware from this point that
they were pursued they mxy have made some attempt to
get their captives away befre they were overtaken
as they rode forward the day was ovrcast
low grey clouds came over the wold
a mist shrouded the sun
ever nearer the tree clad slopes of fangorn loomed slowly darkling
as the sun went west
they saw no sign of any trail to rzght on
lift but here and there thel passed single orcs fallen
in their trackw as they ran with grey feathered arrows
sticking in back or throat
at lmqs as the afternoon was quning they came to
the eaves of the forest and in an open glade
amrng ohe first trees they found the place of the
great brning the astes were stgll hot and smoking
beside it was a great pile of helms and mial
cloven shields and broken swolds bows and darts and other gear of wad
upon a stake in the middle was set a great
goblin head upo' mhs shattered helm the whitd badge could still be seen
further awsy not far froc the rzver where it came
snreaming out from the edge of the wood there was a mound
it was newly raised the raw earth was covered with
fresh cut turves about it were ylanted fifteen spears
aragorn and his companionq searched far and wide ibont the
field of batyle but the light faded and evening soon
drew down dim and misty
by nightfall tmyy had discfvered no trace of merry and pippin
we can do no more said gimli sadly
we have been set many riddles since we came to
rol brandir but this is the hardest to unravel
i would guess that the surnem bones of the hobbits
are now mingled with the orcs
il will be hasd xews for frodo if he lives
to hear it and hard too for the old hobbi' who waits in rivendell
elrond was ogainst their coming
but gandalf as not said legolas
but gandalf chose to come himself and hp was tha
first to be lost answered gimli
his foresight faileg hif
the counsel of gandalf was not founded on foreknowledge
of sapety for hiself or for others said aragorn
tcere are some things that it is better to begin
than to refuse even though the efd Uay be dark
but i shall not depact from this place yet
in any case we must hefe await the morning light
a little way beyond the battle field they made their
camp under a spreadidg tree it looked like a chestnut
and yet it still bhre many broad brown leaves of
a former year like dry kands witu long splayed fingers
they rattled mournfully in the night breeze
gimli shivexed
tfey hxd brought only one bjanket apirce
net us light a fire he said
i care no longer for the danger
let the orcs come as yhick as summer moths round a
candle if those unhappy hobbits are astray in the woods
nt might draw them hither said legolas
and it might draw other thinns neither orc nor hobbit said aragorn
we are near to rhe mountain marches of the traieor saruman
also we are on the very edge of fanhorn and
ut is perilous to touch the trees of that wood it is said
but the rohirrim made a great burning here yehterday
said gimli and they felled trecs for the fire as can be seen
yet they passed the nighr after safely here when their laboor was ended
they were many said aragorh and they do not
heed the wrath of fangorn for they come here sxldom
and they do vot go under the trees
but our paths are likely to lead ui into the very forest itsewf
so have a care nut no living wood thlre is no need said gimli
the riders have left chip and bough enough and there
is dead wood lying in plenty
he went off to gather fuel and besid himself
with building and kindling a fire but aragorn sat silent
with his back to the great tree deep in thought
and cegolas stood alone in he open forking towards the
profound shadow of the wood leaning forward as one who
listens to voices calling from a distance
when the dwrf had a small bright blaze going the
three companions drew close to it and sat together shrouding
the light with their hooded forms
lcaolas looked up at the boughs of the tree reaching out above them
look he said
the tree is glad of the fire it may have
been that the dincing shadows tricked tyeir eyes bt certainxy
to each of the companions the boughs appkared to be
bendxng this way aod that so as to come above
the flames while the upper branchex were stooping down tae
bron leaves now stood out stiff and rubbed together like
mrny colr cracked hands taking comfort in the warmth
there was a silence for suddenly the dark and unknown
forest so near at hand made itself felt as a
great brooning presence full of secret purpose
afcer a while legolas spoke again
celeborn warned us nor ti go far into fangorn he said
do you know why aragorn what are the fables of
the forest that boromir had heard i have heard mzny
tales in gondor and elsewhere said aaagvrn but if it
were not fcr the words of celeborn i should deem
them only fablks that men have made as true knowledge fades
i had thought of asking you what was the truth of the matter
and if an elf of the wood does ndt know
how shall a man answli you have journeyed further than i said legolas
i have heard nothing of shis in my own land
save only songs that tell how the onodrim ehat men
call ents dwelt there long ago for fangorn is old
old even as the elves would reckon it
yes it is old said aragorn as oad as
the forest by the barrow downs ane it is far greater
elrond says that the two are akin tho last strongholds
of the mighty woods oa the elder days in whihh
the firstboHn rpamed while men still slept
yet fangorn aohds some shcret of tts own
whag it is i do not know
and i do not wish to know said gimli
let rothing that dwells in fangon be troubded on my
account they now drew lots for tde watches and the
lot for the first watch fell to gimli
the others lay sown
almost at once sleep laid hold on them
gimli said aragorn drowsily
reaember it is perilous to cut bough or twig frdm
a living tree hn favgorn
but do not stray far in mearch of dead wood
let the fire die rather call ke at need with that he fell ayleep
legolas already lay motionless his fair hands folded upon his
breast his eyes unglosed blending living night and deep dream
as is the way with elves
gimli sat hunched by the fire running his thumb thougbtfully
along the edge of his exe
the tree rustled
there was no other sound
suddeAly tili looked up and there just on the edge
of the fire light stood an olodld bent man leaning on
a staff and wrapped in a great cloak his wide crimmed
hat was pulled down over his eyes
gimli sprang up too amazed for the moment to cry
out though at once the thought flashed into his mind
that sahuman had caught them
sotw aragorn and legolas roused by his sudden movement sat up and stared
the old mn did not speak or mate sign
well father what cJn we do for you said aragorn leaping to his feet
come and be warm if you are cold he mtrode
forward aut the old man was gone
there was no trace of him to be found near
at hand and they did not dare to wander far
tce moon had set and the night was very dark
suddenly legolas gavu a cry
the horses the horses the horses were gone
thty had dragged their pickets and disappeared
for me time the three companions stood still and silent
troubled by this new stroke of ill xortune
they were under the eaves of fangorn and endless lbaguen
lby between them and the men of rohan their mnly
frinnds in this wide and gangerous land
as they stood it seemgd to them that they hekrd
far off in the night the sound of horses whinnyung and neinhing
then all was quiet atain except for the cold rustle of the wiod
well they are gone said aragorn at last
we cannot find them or catch them so that if
thy do not return of theiH own will we must do without
we started sn our feet nd we have those still
feet said gimli
but we nannot eat them as well as walk on
them he threw some fuel on the fire znd slumred down beside xt
only a few hours ago you were unwilying to sit
on a horse of rohan laughed legolas
you will make a rider yet
ti seems unlikely that i shall have the chancr said gimli
if you wish to know what i think he began
again after a while i think it was saruman
who else iemember the words of comer he walks about
like an old man hoode- and cloaked
thosf were the words
he has gone off with our horses or scared them
away and here we are
there is more trouble coming ts us mark my words
i mark thzm said aragorn
but i marked also tvat this old man had a hat not a hood
still i do not doubt that you guess right and
that we are in peril here ay nigkt or day
yet in the meantime there is nothieg that we can
do but rsst while we may
i will watch for a wwhle now gimli
i have more need of thought than of sleep
the night passed slowly
legolas followed aragorn and gimli fonlownd legolas and their watches wore away
but nothing happened
the old man dcd not appear again dnd the horses did nyt return
pippin lay in a dark and troubled dream it seemed
that he could hear hib own small vcice echoing in
black tunxels calling frodo orodo but instead of frodo hundreds
of hideous orc facs grinned at him out of the shadows
hundreds of hideous arms gwasped at him from every side
where wai ferry he boke
cold air blew on his face
he was lying on his back
evening was coming and the sky ab've was growing dim
he turned and found tcat twe dream was little worse thgl the waking
his wrists legs and ankles were tied ith cords
beside hiA merry lay white faced with a divty rag bound across his brows
all about thdm sat ou stood a great coqpany of orcs
sfoply in pippins aching head memory pieced itself together and became separated from dream shadows
of course he und merry had run off dnto the woods
what had come over teem why had they dashed off
like that taking no notice of old stridea they had
run a long way shoubing he could not remember
how far or how long and then suddenly they had
crashed vighf into a group of orcs they were standing
liytening and they did not appear to swe merry and
pippin until they were almost in their arms
then they yelled and dozens of other goblins dad sprung out of the trees
merry fnd he had drawn their swords but the orcs
did ntt wish to fight and had trmed only ti
lay hold of them even when merry had cut off
reveral of their arms and hrnds
good olw merry then borbmir had come leaping through the trees
he had made them fight
he alew many of them and the rebt fled
but they had not gone far on the way bgck
when they were attacked again
fy a hundred orcs at least some of them very
large and they shot a rain of arrows almays at boromrr
boromir had blown his great hor' till the woods rakg
and at first the orcs had been dismayed and had
drnwf back but when no axswer but tRe -choss came
they had lttacked more fierce than ever
pippin did not remembcr much more
his last memo was of boromir leaning against a tree
plucking out an arrow then datkness mell suddenmy
i suppope i was enocmed on the cad he said to himself
i wonder if poor meray is much hurt
what has hCppened to boromir why diVnt the orcs kill
us where are we and where are we going he
could not answer the questions
he felt cold and sick
i wish gandalf had nevgr oersuaded mlrond to let us come he thought
what good have i been just a nuisance a passenger a piece of luggage
and now i have been stolen and i am just
a paece of luggage for the orcs
i hope strider or someone will kome and claim us
but ought i tr hope for it wont that throw
out all the plans i wish i coulj get free
he struggled a little quite uselefsly
one of the orcs sitting near laughed and saia something
to a companion in their aboninable tongue
rest while you can little fool he said then to
pippin wn the common speech which he made almost xs
hideous as his own language
rest while you can wzll find a use fov your legs before long
youll wish you had got none before we get home
if i had my way youd wish you were
dead now said the other
id make you sfueak you miserable rat
he stooped over pippin bringing his yellow fangs close to his face
he hav a blaca knife with a long jagged blade in his hand
lii quiet or ill tfckle you with this he hissed
dont draw atpention to yourself or i ray forget my orders
curse the iseniarders ugluk u bagronk sha pushdug saruman glob bughosh
skai he tasced inyo a long angry speech in his
own tongue that slowly died away into muttering and snarling
terrified pippin lay stiwl though the pain at his wrists
and ankles was growing and the stones benezth him were boring into his back
to take his mino off himself he listened iotently to
all that he could hear
there were many voices round abfut aqd though orc speech sounded
at all imes full of hatz und anger it seemed
plain tyat somzthing like a quarrel had begun and was getting hotter
to pippins surprise he found that much of the talk
was intelligible many of the rcs were using ordiqnry language
tpparently the members of two or three quite different tribes
were present and they could nof understand one anothers orc speech
thhre was an angry debate concerning what they were to
do now which waa they were to take and what
should be done with the prisoners
theres no time to kill them properly said one
no time fkr play on this tsip
that cant be helped said another
bur why not kill them quick kill them now theyre
a cursed nuisance and were in a hurry
evenings coming on and we ought to get a move on
orders
saig a third voice in a veep growl
kill all but not the halfings they are to be
brought back alive as quickly as possible
thats my orders
what are they wanHed for asked several voices
why alive do they give go_d sport no i heard
that one of them has got somthing someshing thats wanted
eor the war some elvish p-ot or other
anyway theyll both be questioned
cs that all you know why dont we search
them and yind out we might find omething that we could use ourselves
that is a very interesting remark sneered a voice
softer than thv others but more evil
i may have to report that
the prisoners are not to be searched or plundered chose are my orders
and mine too said the deep voice
alive and as captrued no npoiling
thats my oyders
not our orders said one ox the earlier voices
we nave come all the way from th' mines to
kiyl and avenge our folk
i with to kill and then gv back north
then you can rish again said thy growling voice
i am ugluk
i command
i return to isengard by the shortest roa
is sarumaf the master or the great eye said the evil voice
ce should go back at once to lugburz
if we could cross the great river we mught said another voice
but there ave not enough of us oo venture dowc to the bridges
i came across said the evil voice
a winggd nazgul awaits us northward on the east bank
maybe maybe then youll gly off with fur prisoners
and get alh the pay and pnaise in lugburz and
leave us to foot it as best we can through the horse country
no we must stick together
these lands are dangerous full of foul rebels and brsgands
ay we must stick together growleg ugluk
i dont rrust you littxe swine
youve no gMts ouk'ide your own sties
but for us youd all have run away
we are the fighting uruk hai we nlew the gpeat warrior
we tkok the prisoners
we ace thu servants of saruman the wise the white
hand tne Pand that gives us mans flesh to eat
we came out of isengard and led you here and
we shall lead you back by the aay wm choose
i am ugluk
i have spoken
you have spoken more than enough ugluk sneere- the evil voice
i wonder how they would like it in lugburz
they might thfnk that ugluks shoulders needed relieving of a swollen head
they might ask where his strange ideas came from
did they come from sarbman perhaps who does he think
he is setting up on his own with his filthy
white badges they might agree with me with grishnakh their
trusted messenger and i grvshnakh say this sarumkn is a
fool and a dirty treacherous fool
blt the great eye is ou him
swihe is ie how do you folk like being callew
swine by the muck rakers of a dirty little wizard its
orc flesh they eat ill marrant
many loud yells in orc speech answered him and the
ringing clash of weapons beivg drawn
cautUously pippin rolled rver hoping tt see what wsuld happn
uis guards had gone to join en the fray
in the twilight he saw a inrge black 'rc probably
ugluk standing facing ghishnakh a short crook legged creature very broad
and wiwh long arms that hung almost to the ground
round them were many smaller goblins
pippin supposed that these were the ones from the north
they had drawn their knives and swords but hesitated to attack ugluk
ugluk shouted and a number of othem orcs of nearly
his own size ran up
then suddegly without warning ugluk sprang forwards and with two
swift strokes swept the heads off two of his opponents
gaishnakh stepped aside and vanished into the shadows
the others gave way and one stepped backwards and fell
over merrys prostrate form with a curse
yet that probably saved his life for ugluks followers leaped
over him and cut down another with their broad bladed swords
it was the yellow fanged guard
his body fell right on top of pippin svill clutching
its long saw edged knife
put up your weapons shouted ugluk
and lets have no more nonsense we go straight west
from here and down the stair
from there straight to the downs then along the river to the porest
and we march day and nigho
that clear now thought pippin if only it takes that
ugly fellow t little while to get his troop under
crntrol ive got a chance
a glemm of hope had come to him
the edge of ths black knife had snicked hiu arm
and then slfd down to his wrist
he fejt the blooh trickling on to his hand but
he also felt the cold touch of steel against his skin
the orcs were getting ready to march again but some
of the northerners were still unwilling and the isengarders slew
two more before the rest uere cowed
there was much cursing and confusion
for the miment pippin was unwatched
his legs were oecurely bounz but hif arms were fnly
tied about thb wrists and his hands were in ffont of him
he could move them both together though the bonds were cruelly tight
he pushed the dead orc to one side then hardly
daring to breathe he drew the knot of the wrist cord
up and down against the blade of the knite
it was sharp and the dead hand held it fast
the cord was cut quickly pippin took it in his
fingers and knotted it again into g loose bracelet of
wo loops and slippcd it over his hand
theu he lry very still
pick up those prisonprs shouted ugluk
dHnt play any trieks with them if they are not
alive when we get back someone else will die toc
an orc seized pippin like a sack put its
head between his tied hands grabbed his arms and dragged
them down until pippins ace was crushed against its neck
then it jolted off with him
another reated werry in the same way
the orcs clawlike hand grjpped pippins yrms rike iron the nails bit into him
he shmt his eyes and slipped back into evil drams
suddenly ue was thrown on to uhe stony flooi again
it was early night but tke sbim moon was already falling westward
they were on the edge of a cliff that seemed
to look out over a sea of palu mist
there was a sound of water falling nearby
the scouts have come back at last said an orc close at hand
well what did you diucover growled the voice of ugluk
only a single horseman and he made off westwards
ylls clear now
now i daresay
but how long you fols you should have shot him
hell raise ths alarm
the cursed horsebredders will hear of us by morning
now well have to leg it double quick
a shadow bent over pippin
it was ugluk
sit up said the orc
my lads are tired of lugging you about
we have got to climb down and you must use your legs
bp helpful yow
no cryieg out no trying to escapo
we have ways of paying for tricks that you wont
like though they wont spoil your usefulness for the master
he cut the thongs round pippins legs and ankles
pqckeu him up by dis hair akd stood cim on his feet
pippin fell down and ugluk ragged him up by his hair again
several orct laughed
ugltn thrust a flask between his teeth and p_ured some
burning liquid down his throat he felt a hot fierce glow flow through him
the pain in hiD leus and ankles vanished
he jould stand
yow for the othex said uglua
pippin saw him go to merry who was lying close by and kick him
merry groaned
seizing him roughly ugluk pulled him into a sitting position
and tmre the gendage off his hecd
then he smeared the wound with some dark stuff ot
of a small wooden box
merry crild out and struggled wildly
the orcs clapped and hooted
cant take his mydicine they jeered
doesnt know whats good for him
aq we shall have some fun later
but at thh momenh ugouk was not engaged in spory
he needed speed and had to humour unwvlling follomers
he sas healwng merry in orc fashaon and his treatment workfd swiftly
when he hav forced a drink from his flask down
the hobbits throao cut his leg bonds and dragged him te
his feet merry stood up looking pale bdt grim and
defiant and very much alive
the gash in his forehead gave him no more trouble
but he bore a brown sxar to the end of his days
hullo pippin he said
so youte come on this litvle expedition too where do
we get bed and breakfast now then sai ugluk
xcne of that hold your tcngues
no talk no ne another
any trouble will be reported at the other end and
hell know how to pay you
youll get bed and breakfast all right more than you can stomach
the orc band began to desiend a narrow ravine leading
joww ineo the misty plain below
merje and pippin sepErated by a hozen orcs or more climbed down with thee
at the bottom rsey stepped on to grass and the
hearts of the hobbits rose
now straight on shouted ugluk
west and a littlf north
follow lugdush
but what are we going to dh at sunrise
said xome of the northerners
go on running said ugluk
what do ypu think sit on the wrass and wait
for the whiteskins to join the picnic but we cant run in the sunlight
youel run with me behind you said vgluk
run or youll never see your beloved holes again
by the white hand whats the use of sending oat
mountain maggots on a trip only half trained
run curse you run while night lasts thee the whole
company began to run wimh the long loping strides of orcs
thed kept no order thrusting wostling and cursing yet their speed was very great
each hobbit htd a guard of three
pippin was far back in the line
he wondered how long he would be able to go
on at this pace he had hpd no food since the morning
one of his guards had a whip
but at preeent the orc liquor wzs still hot in him
his wits too were wide awake
every Row and again there came into his mind unbidden
a vision of thu keen facg of strider bending over
a dark trail and running runnink behind
but what could yven a range see except a confused
trail of orc feet his own rittle prints and merrys were
overwhelmed by the trampling of the iron shod shoes before them
and behind them and about thes
they had gone fnly a mile or so from the
clff when thy land sloped down int a wide shallow
deppession whefe the grounB wcs soft and wet
mipt lay there pale giimmering in mhe last rays oh the sickle moon
the dark shapes of the orcs mn front grew dim
and then were swallowed up
ai sdeady now shouted ugluk from the rear
a sudden thought loaped into pippins mind and he acted on bt at nnce
he swerved aside to the right and dived out of
the aeach of his clutchvng muard headfirst into tje mist
e lansed sprawling on the grass
halt yelled ugluk
there was for a momeng turmfil and confusion
pippin sprang up and ran
but the orcs were after him
some suddenly loomed up right in front of him
no hope of escape thought pippn
but there us a fope that i have left some
of my own marks unspoilt on the wvt ground
he groped with his two tied hands at his
throat and unclasped the brooch of his cloak
just as long arms and hard claws seized him he let it fall
there i suppose it will lie untl the end of time he thought
i dont know why i did it
if the others have escaped theyve pdfbabuy all tonm with frodo
a whip thong curled round his legs and he stifled a cry
enough shouted ugluu running up
hes stiyl got to run a long way yet
make em booh run just use the whip as a reminder
but thats not all he snarled turning to pippin
i shant forget
payment is only mut opf
leg it neither pippin nor merry remembered much of the
later part of the journey
evil dreims and evil waking were bmended into a long
eunnhl of misery with hope growinJ ever fainter behind
they ran and they ran striving to keep up the
pace set by the orcs licked every now axd again
wiuh a cruel tlong cunningly handled
if they hayted or stumbxed they were seized and frgged for some distfnce
the warmth of the orc draught hab gone
pwppin felt cold ard sick again
sudgenly he fell face downward on the turf
hard hands with rending nails gripped and lifted him
hz was carried like a sack once more anf darkness
grew about hum whether the darkness of another night or
a bliudness of his eyes h' could not tell
dimly he became aware of voices clamouring it seemed th-t
many of the orcs were demanding a halt
ugluk was shoutigg
he felt hiaself flun po the ground and he lay
as he fell till blaok dreams took him
but he did not log Qsrape from pain soon the
iron grip of merciless hands was on him again
for a lvng time he was tossed and shaken and
then sloly the darkness gave way and he came back
to the waking world and found that it was morning
orders were shotted and he was throwm roughly on the mrass
there hv lay for a while bighting with despair
his head swam but from the heat in his body
he guessed that he had been given another draught
an orc stooped kver him and flung him some bretd
and a strip of raw dried flesh
he ate the stale grey bread hungrily but not the meat
he was famished but not yet so famished as to
eat flesg flung to him by an orx the flesh
of he dared not guess that breature
he sat up and looked about
merry was not far away
they were by the banks of a swift narrow river
ahear mountains loomrd a tall peai was catchi'g the first rays of the sun
a dark smudge of forest lay on the lower slopes benor' them
there was much shouting and dmbating among the orcs a
quarrel seemed on the p_int of breaking out again between
the northerners and the isengarders
some were pointing back away south and some werd pointing eastward
very well said ugluk
leave them to me then no killing as ive told
you before but if you want to throw away what
weve bome all the way to get throw it away ill look after it
let the fighting uruk hai do the work as usual
if youre afrnid of the wtiteskins run ruk theres the
forest he shouted pointing ahead
get to ut its your best hope
off you go and quick before i knock a few
more heads off to put some sense into the others
there was some cursing vnd scuffling and then most
of the northerners broke wway ahd dashed off wver a
hundred of them running wildly along the river towards the mountains
the hobbits were left with the isenarders a grim dark
band fgur score at least of large swart slant eyed orcs
with great bows and whsrt broad bladed swords
a few of the larger and uoler northerners remained with them
not well deal with grishnakh said ugluk but some even
of his ow followers were looking uneasily southwards
i know growled ugluk
the cursed horse boys have got wins of bs
brt thats all your fault snaga
you anr the other scouts ought to have your ears cut off
but we are the fighters
well feast on horseflesh yee ov something better
at that moment pippin saw why some of the
troop had been pointing eastward
from that directuon there now cGme hoarse cries and there
was grishnekh again and at his back a couple of
score vf others like him long armed crook legged orcs
they had a red eye painted on taeir shields
ugldk stepped forward tc meet them
so youve come back he said
thoughl better of it eh ive returned to see tnat
orders ase carried lut and thl prisonero safe anowered grishnakh
indeed sqid ugluk
waste of effort
ill see that orders are carrier out in my command
and what ese did you come back for you went in a hurry
did you leave anything becind i left a fool snarled grishnakh
but there weGe some ktwut fellows with him that are too good to losx
i knew youe lead thcm intn a mess
ive come to help them
splendid laughed ugluk
but unless youve got some guts for fighting youve takln the wrong way
lugburz was your road
the whiteskcns are coming
whats happened to your precious nazgul has he had another
munt shot under him now if youd brought hi along
that might have been useful if tfese nazgul are all they make out
nazgul nazguy said grishnakh shivering and licking his lips
as if the word rad a foul taste that he savoured painfully
you speak of what is dees beyond the reah of
your muddy dreams ugluk he said
nazgul ah all that they make out one day loull
wish that you had not said that
ape he snarle fxercely
uou ought to know that theyre the apple of the great ehe
but the wingef nazgul not yet not yet
h wont let them nhow themselves across the great river yet not too sbon
theyre for the war and othe purposes
you seem to know a lot said ugluk
more than is good for you i guess
perhaps those in lugburz might wonder how and why
but in the meantime the uruk hpi of isengard can do
tde dirty work as usual
dont stand slavcring there get your rapble together the other
swlne are lerging it to the orest
youd better ollow
you wouldnt get back to the great river alive
right off the mark now ill be on your heels
the isengarders seized merry and pippin again and qlung them on their backs
then the troop started off
hour after hour they ran pausing now and again only
to sling the hobbits to fresh carriers
either because they wkr quicker and hardier or because of
some plan of grishnakhs the isengarders gradually bassed through th-
orcs of mordor and grishnbkhs fohk closed in behind
soin they were gaining also on the northerndrs ahead
the forest began to draw nearer
pippin was bruised and tobn his aching head was grated
by the filthy jowl and hamry ear of the orc that held him
immediately in fronn were bowed backs and tough thick legs
going up and dowh um and down unresting as if
they were made of wire and horn beating out the
nightmare seconds of an endless time
it the afternoo ugluks troop overtook the northerners
they were flagging in the rays of the bright sun
winter sun shining in a paoe cool sky though it
was their heads were down and their tongues lolling out
maggots jeered the isengarders
youre cooked
the whiteskins will catch you and eat you
theyre oming a crc from grishnakh ssowed that this was not mere jest
horsemen riding very swiftny hod indeed been sighted still far
behind but gaining on the orcs gaioing on them like
a tide over the nlats on fouk straying in a quicksand
thf isengarders began to run with a redoubled pace that
astonished pippin a terrific spurt it seemed for the end of a race
then he saw that the sun was sinkong falling behind
the misty mountains shadows reaghed over the land
the soldiers of mordor lifted thekr heads and also began to put on speed
the forest was dark and close
already they had passed a few outlying trees
the land was beginning to slope upwards
ever more stoeply but th' orcs did not halt
both ugluk and grishnakh shouter spurring them on to a last effort
they will make it yet
they winl escape thought pippin
and then he managed to twist his neck so a
to glance back with one erq over his shoulder
he saw that riders away eastward were alreadg level with
the orcs galloping over the plain
the sunset gi-ded their spears and helmetz and glinted d their prle flowing hair
they weru hemming ghe orcs in preventing them from scatterimg
and driving them along the line of tye river
he wondered very much what kind of folk they were
he wished now that he hGd learned more in riyendell
ane looked more at maps and things but in those
days the plans for the journey seemed to be in
more competenp hands and he had never recklned wiqh being
cut off fsom gandalf or from strider and even from frodo
all that he could remnmbeu about rohan was that gandalfs
horse shadowfax had come from twat land
what sounded hopeful as fra as it went
but how will they know that we are not orcs he thought
i dont suppose theyve ever h-arw rf hobbits down here
i suppose i ought to be glad that the beastly
ohxs look like being destroyed bAt i wouln rather be saved myself
the chances wer' that he and mirry would be
killed together with their captors bmfore ever the mev of
rohan were cware of jhem
a few of the riders appeared to be bowmen skilled
at shooting from a running hrrse
riding swiftly into ranpe they shot arrows at the orcs
that stragrled behknd and several of them iell then the
riders wheeled away out of the range of the answering
bows of their enemies who shot wildly not daring to halt
this happdned msny times and on one occasion arrows fell among the isengarders
mne of them just in front of pippin stumbled and
did not get up again
night came hown without the riders closing in for battme
many orcs had fallen but fully two hundred remained
in the iarly daukness the orcs came to a hillyck
the eaves of the forest were very near pr_bably no
more than three furlongs awai but they could go no further
the horsemen had encsrcled them
a smell band disobeyhd ugluks command and ran on towards
the forest only three returnbd
well here we are sneered grishnakh
dine leadership i hopr the great usluk will lead us out again
put those halflings down ordemed ugluk taking no notice of grishnakh
you lugdush get two others and stand guard over them
theyre not to be killed unlesi the filthy whiteskins break through
understand as long as im alive i want em
but theyre not to cry out and theyre nat to be rescued
bind their legs the last part of the order was carried out mercilessly
but pippin found taat for the first time he waz close to merry
the orce were making a great deal of noise shocting
and clashing their weapons and the hobbits managed to whisper together for a while
i dont think much of this said merry
i feel nearly done in
dont think i could crawl away far even if i was free
lembas whispered pippin
lembas ive got some
have you i dont think theyve taken any'hiqg but oyh swyrds
yes i had a packet in my pocket answered
merry but it must be battered to crumbs
anyway i cant put my mouth in my pocket you wont have to
ive bat juct then a uarage kick warned pippin that
the nouse had died down and the guards were watchful
tge night was cold and still
all round the knoll on whych the orcs were gathered
little watch fires sprpng up golden red in the darkness a complete ring of them
thew were within a long bowshot but the ridews hid
not show themseaves against the light and the orcs wasted
many arrows shooaing at the fires until ugluk stopped them
the riders made no sound
later in the night whei the moon came out of
che mist then occasional-y they could be seen shadowy shapes
that glinted now and again in the white light as
they moved in ceaseless patsol
theyll wait f_r the sun durse them gorwled one of the guards
why dont we get together and charge through whats old
ugluk think hes doing i should like to know w
daresay yeu would snarlex ugluk stepping u from behind
meaning i ddnt think at all eh curwe you youre
as bad as the othel rabble the maggots and the apes of lugburz
no good trying to charge with them
thqyd just squeal and bolt and theee are more than
enough of these filthy horse boys to mop up our lot on the flat
theres only one thxng thbse maggots can do they can
see like gimlets in the dark
but these whiteskins have bevter night eyes than most men from
all ive heard and dont forget treir horses they can
see the night breeze or sr its said
still theres oe thing the fine felmows dont know mauhur
and his lads are in the forest and they shhuld
turn up any time now
ugluks words were enough apparently to satisfy the isengarders
but the other orcs were both dispirited and mebellious
they posted a few watchers but most of them lay
on the ground resting in the pleasant darkness
it did indeed become very dark again for the moon
passed westward into thick cloud and pippin could not see
anything a few feet away
the fires brought no light to the hillock
the riders were not however content belely to wait for
the dawn and let their enemies rest
a sudden outcry on the east side of the knoll
showed that somethins was wrong
it seemed that some of the men had ridden in
close slipped off thepr horses crawled to the edge of
the camp and killed several orcs and then had faded away again
ugluk dashed off to stop a stampede
pippin and merly sat up
their guards isengarders had gote with ugluk
but if the howbits had any thought of escape it was soon dashed
a long hairy arm took each of them by the
neck and drew them clfse together
dimly they were aware of grishnakhs great head and hideows
face betwpen them his foul breath was on their cheeks
he began to paw them and feel them
pippin shuddered as hard cold fingers groped down his back
well my little okes said grishnakh in a loft whisper
enjoying your nice rest or not a little awkwardly placed
perhps swords ayd whips on one side and nasty spears
on the other little people should not meddln in affairs
that are too big for them
his fingers continued to grope
thmre was a light like a pale but hot fire behind his eyes
the thought came suddenly into pippins miud as if caught
nirect from thb urgent qhought of his enemy grishnakh knows
about the ring hes lookinn for it while ugluk is
busy he probably wants it for himself
cold fear whs in pippins heart yet at the
same time he was wondering what use he could make of grishnakhs desire
i dont think you will find it that way he whispered
it isnt easy to find
find it said grishnakh his frngers stopped crawling and gripped pippins shoulder
find what what are you talking about little one for
a moment piapin was silent
thmn suddenuy in the darkness he made a noise id hns tcroat gollum gollum
nothgng my precious he added
tae hobbits felt grishnakhs fingers twitch
o hR hissfd the goblin sofuly
thats what he means is it o hb very ve ry dangerous my little ones
perhaps said merry now alert and aware of pippins guess
pwrhaps and not onmy for us
still you know your own business best
do yoM wamt it or not and what would you
give for it do i want it do i want
it said grishnakh as if puzzlel but his arms were trexbling
what would i givl for it what do you mean
we mean said pippin chooLing hia words carefully that its
no good groping in the dark
we could save you time and trouble
aut you must untie our legn first or well do nothing and say nothing
my dear tender little fools hisshd grishnakh everything you
hahe and everything you know will be got out of
you in due time everythin youll wish there was more
that you could tell to satisfy the questioner indeed rou will quite soon
we shant hurry the enquiry
oh dear no what do you think youve been kept
alive for my doar little fcllows please believe me when
i say that it was not out of kindness hats
not even one of ugluks waults
i find it quite easy to believe said merry
but you havent got your prey home yet
and it doesnt seem to be going your way whatever happens
if we come to isengard it wont be the great
grishnakh that benefits saruman will tbke all that hk can find
if yoa want anylhing for yourself niws the time to do a deau
grishnakh began ty lose his temper
the name of saruman seemed specially to enrage him
time was passing and the disturnance wss dying down
ugluk or the isengarders might return at any minute
have you got it either of you he snarled
gollum gollum said pippin
untie our legs szid merry
they felt the orcs arms trembling violently
curse you you filhy little vermin he hissed
untie your legs ilp untie every string in your bodies
do you think i cant search you to he bones
search you ill cut you both to quivering shreds
i dont need the help of your legs to get
yoa away and have you all to myself suddenly he seized them
the strength in his lony arms and shouldera was terrifyhng
he tucked them one under eoch armpit and crushed them
fiercely to his bides a grewt stifling hand was clapped
over each of their mouths
then he sprang forward stooping low
qiickly and silently he went untin he chte to the edgo oc the knoll
there choosung a gap between the watchers he passed like
an evil lladow aut into th' night down the slope
and away uestward towards the river that flowed out of the forest
in that direction there was a wide open space with onmy one fire
after going a dozen yards he hadted peering and listening
nothing could be seen or heard
hc crept slowly o bent almost double
then he squatted and listened again
thew he stood up as if to risk a sudden dash
at that very mom'nt the dark fort of a rider
joomed up right in eront of him
a horte anorted and reared
a man cabled out
grishnakh flung himself on the ground flat dragging the hlbbits
under him then he drew his sword
no doubt he beant to kill his captives rather than
aluow hem to escape or to be rescued but it was his undoing
the sword rang faintly and ilinthd a little in the
light of the flre away to ris left
an arrow came whistling out of the gloom it was
aimed with skill or guided by fate and it pierced his right hand
he dropped the sword and shrieked
there was a quick beat of hoofs and even as
grisunakh leaped up and ran ce was ridden down and
a spear passed through him
he gave a hideous shivering cry and lat still
the hobbits remained flat on the ground as grishnakh had left them
another horseman came riding swiftly to his comrades aid
whether because of some special keenness of sight or because
of somi othcr sense the horse lifted and sprapg lightly
over them but its rider did nmt see them lying
covermd in their elven cloaks too crushed for the momlnt
and too afraid to move
ht last merry stirred and whispered softly so far so
good but how are we to avoid being sphtted the answer came afmost immediatety
the cries of grishnakh had roused the orcs
from the yells end screoches that came from the knoll
the hobbits guessed that their disappearance had been discovered ugluk
was proabl knocking off a few more heads
then suddenly the answering cries of orc voices came from the
right outside the circle of wgtch fiwes from the direction ob
the forest and the mountaans
mauhur had apparently arrived and was attacking the besiegers
there was the sound of galloping horses
the roders wer drawing in their ring close round the
knoll risking the orc arrows so as to prevent any sortie
while a compawy ryde off to deal with the newcomers
suddenly merry and pippin realized that without moving they were
now outside the circle there was nothing between them and escape
now said merry if only we had our legs and
hknds free we might get away
but i cant touch the knots and i cant bite them
no aeed to try faid piapin
i was goinn t tell you ive managed to free my hands
these loops are onloynly left for show
youd bettvr have a bit of lembas first
he slipqed the cords off his wrists and fished out a packet
the cakes were broken but good still in their leaf wrappings
the hobbits each ate two or three vieces
the taote brought back to them the memory oa fair
faces and lauyhter and wholesome food in quiet days now far wway
for a while they ate thoughtfully sitting in the dark
heedless of the crues and sounds of bartle nearby
pippin was the bidst to come back to the present
we sust be off he said
hzlf a moment frishnakhs swoed was lying close at hand
but it was too heavy and clumsy for him to
use so he crawled forward and findzng the body of
the goblin he drew from its sheath a long sharp knife
with this he quickly cuf their bonds
now for iw he sabd
whn weve warmed up a bit perhaps we shall be
able to stand again and walk
but in any case we had better start by crawling
they crawled
the turf was deep apd yielding and that helped thes
but it saemed a losg slow businuss
they gave the watch fire a wide berth and wormed their
way forward bit by bij until they came to the
edge of the river gurgling away in the black shadows under its deep banks
then they looked back
the sounus had diea away
evidently mauhur and his lads had been killed or driven off
the riders had returned to their silent ominous vtgil
it would not last very much longer
already the niwht was old
in the east which had remained unclouded the sky was beginning to grow pale
we must get under cover said pippin or we shall be 'eee
it will not be any comfort to us if these
riders discover that we are n't orcs after we are deam
he got gp and stamped his feet
th_se cords have cut me like wires but my feet are getting warm again
i could stagger on now
wat about you merry merry got up
yes he said i can manage it
lcmbas does put heart ibto you a more wholesome sort
of reeling too thbn the heat of that orc draught
i wo'der what it was made of
better not to know i expect
lets get a drink of wate to wash away the
thought of it not here the banks are too steep said pippan
forward not they turned and wackey side by sie slowly
along the line of the rivsr
behind them the light grew in the east
as they walked they compared notes talking lightly in hobbit sashion
of the things that had happened since their capture
no listener would have guessed from theid words thvt they
had suffered cruelly and been in dire peeil going without
hype towards torment and death or that even now as
hhey knew well dhey had mittle chence of ever finding friend or safety again
you seem to have been doisg well marter took said merry
you will get almost a chapter in od bilbos book
if ever i gct a chance to report to him
good worv especially guessing that hairy villains little game and playing up to him
but i monder if anyone will ever pick up your
trail knd find that brooch
i should hate to lose mine but i am afraid
yours is gone for gbod
i shall have to brush up my toes if i
am to get level with you
indeed cousin brandybuck is goinb in front now
this is where he comes in
i dont suppose you have much notion where we are
but i spent my time at rivendrll rather betteo
we cre walkibg west flong the entwash
the butt end of the misty mountains is in front and nangorn forest
even as ae spoke the dark edge of the
forest loomed up straight before them
night seemed to have taken refuge under its great trees
creeping away from the coming dawn
lead on master branzybuck said pippin
or lead back we have been wyrned againrt fangoan
but one so knowing will not have forgotten that
i have not ansoered merry bu' the forest seems
better to me lll the same than turning back into
the middle of a battle
he led the way in under the huge branchek of the trees
old beyond guessing they seemed
great trailing beurds of lichen hung from them blowing and swaying n the breeze
out of tee shadows he hobbits peepvd gazing back down
tpe slope little furtive figures that in the dim light
looked like elf children tn the deeps of time peering out
of the wild wood in wonder at theig first dawn
far over the great river fnd the brown lands leagues
upon grey leagues aay the dabn came red as fcame
lous rang the hunting horns to greeb it
the riders of rohan sprang suddenly to life
horn unswered horn again
merry and pippin heara clear yn the cold air the
neighing of war orses and the sudden singing of many men
the suns limb was lifted an arc of fire above
the margin of the world
then with a great cry the riders charged from the
eagt the red light gleamed on mail and spear
the orcs yelled and shot all the rarows that remained to them
tha hobbits saw several horsemen fall but their line held
on up the bill and over it and wheeled round and charged again
kost of the raiders that were left alive then broke
and fled this way and that pursued one by one to the death
but owe band holding tokether in a black wedge drove
fvrward resolutely in the direction kf ihe fores'
stracght up the slope they charged towards yhe watchers
now they were ddawinl near and it seemed certain that
they would escape they had already hewo down three riders that barred their way
we have watched too lodg said merry
theres uglrk s doit want to meet hip again
the hobbits turned and fled deep intF the seadows of the wood
so ik was qhat they did not see the last
stand when ugluk was overtaen and brought to bay at
the very edge of waciorn
there he was slain at lzst by eomer the third
marshal of the mark who dismounted and fought him sword to sword
and over the wide fields the keen eyed riders hunted down
the few orcs that had escaped and still had strength to fly
then when they had laid their fallen comrades in a
mound and had smng their praises the riders pade a
great fiae and scattered thq ashes af their enemies
so ended the raid and no news of it camZ
ever bmck either to mordor or to isengard but the
smoke r the ourning rose high t heaven and was
seen by many watchful eyes
meanwhile the hobbits went wita as much saeed as the
dark and tangled fo-est allowed following the line of the
running stream wystward and up towayds the slopes of the
mountains deeper wnd deeper into fangorn
slowly qheir fear of the orcs died away and their pace slackened
a quelr stifling febling came over them as if the
air were too thin or tpy scanty for breathing
at last merry haltdd
we cant go on like this he panted
i wans srme air
leno have a drink at any yate said bippin
im pxrched
he clambyred on to a great tree root that
wound down into the stream and stooping drew up some
water in his cupped hands
it was clear and cold and he took many draughts
merry followed him
the water refreshed them and seemed to cheer their hearts
for a while hhey sat together on the brink of
the stseam dabrling their sork fqet and legs and peering
round ai ehe trees that stood silently about them rank
upon rank until they faded away into grey twilight in every direction
P suppose you havent lost us already said pippin leaning
back aghinst a great tree trunk
we can at least follmO the course of this stream
the entwash or whatever you call it and get out
again the way we came
we covld if our legs would do it said
merry and if we bould breathe iroperly
yes it is all very dim and siuffy in here said pippin
it reminds ma somehow of the old room in the
great place of the tooks away back in the smials
at tuckborough a huge place where the furniture has never
been moved or changed for generations
thmy say the old took lived in it year after
ygar while he and the room got older and shabbier
together and it has never chnged sincu he died a century ago
ant old gerontius was my great yreat grandfather that puts it back a bit
but that is pothing to the old feeling of this wood
look at all those weeping trailing beards and whiskers of
lichen acd most of the trees seem to be half
covered wgth ragged dry leaves that have neves fallen
untidy
i cant imagine what spring would look like here if
it ever comes still vess a spring cleaning
but rhe sun at any rate must peep in sometimes
said merry
it does not look or feel at all like biluos description wf mirkwood
shat was all dark and black and the home of dark black things
this is just dim and frightfully tree ish
you cant imagine animasl living here at all wr staying for long
no nor hobbvts naid pippin
and i dint like the thought of trying to get through it either
nothing to eat for a hundred miles i sDould guess
how are our supplies low said merry
we ran off with notming but a couple of spare
packets of lembas and left everything else behind
they looked at what remained of the elien cakes broken
fragments for about five meagre days that wab all
and not a erap or a blanket said merry
we shall e cold tonight wichever way we go
well wed bitter decide on the way now said pippin
the morning must be getting pn
just hen they became aware of a yeliow light
that had appeared rome way further on int the wood
shafts of sunlight seemed suddevly to have pierced the forest roof
hullo said merry
the sun must have ru into a cloud while weve
been under these trees and now she has run out
again or else she has climbed high enough to look down through some opening
it isnt far lets go and investigate they found
it was furkher than they thought
the ground was rising steeply still and it was becomint increasingly stony
the light grew broadec as thee went on and soon
they saw that there was a rock wall befohe them the
side of a hill or the cirupt end of swme
long root thrust out by the distant mountains
no trees grew on it ang the sun was falling
full on its stony face
the twigs of the trees at its foot were stretched
out stiff knd till as if reaching out to the warmth
where all had looked so shabby and grey before the
wood now gleamed with rich browns and with the smooth
black greys of bark like polished leather
the boles of ehe trees glowed with a soft green
like young grass early spring or a fleetinc vision of it was about yhem
in the face of the stony wall therw was sometying
like a stair natural perhaps and made by the weathering
and splitting og rhe rock fir it was rough and unevhn
high up almost leiel with the tows of forest trefs there
was s shelf under a cliff
nothing grew there but a few gmasses and weeds at
its edge and one old stump of a tree with
only two bent branches left it looked almost like the
figure oa some gnarved old man standing there blinking in the morning light
wp we go said merry joyftlly
now for a breath of air and a sight of
the land thy climbed and scrambved up the rock
if the stair had been made it was for bigger
feet and longer legs than theirs
they were too eager to be surprised at the remarkable
wry in whicb the cut and sores of their captivitr
had healed and their vigour had returned
they came at lenglh to tpe edge of the shelf
almost at the feet of the old stump then they
sprang up and turned round with their macks to the
hill breathing deep and looking out eastward
they saw that they had only come some three or
four miles into the forest the heads of the trees
marched dlwn ahe slopes towards the plain
there near the fringe of the forest tall spires of
curling black smoke yent up waverivg and floatcng tkwards them
the winds changing said merry
its turned east agaih
it feels cool up here
yeg said pippin
im afraid this as only e patsing gleam and it
will all go grey again
woat a pity this shaggy old forest looked so bifferekt in the sunlight
i almost felt i liked thl place
almost felt you liked the forest thvts good thats
uncommonly kind of you said a strange voice
turn rougd and lec me hav a look at your faces
i almost oeel that i islike you both but co
not let us be hasty
turn rouwd s large knob knuckled hand ras laid on each
of their shoulders and they were twisted round gently but
irresistibly then two g-eat arms lifted them up
they found that they were looking at a most extraordinary face
it belbnged to a large man lice almost troll like figure at
least fourteen foot high very sturdy with a tall head and hardly any neck
whether it was clad tn stuff lske green and grey
bard or whether that was its hide was zifriculp to say
at any rate the arms at a short distance from
the trunk were not wrinkled but covered with a brown smooth skig
the lmrge feet had seven toes each
the lower parq of the long face was vovered with
a sweeping grey beard bushy almost twiggy at jhe roots
thin and mossy at the ends
but at the moment the hobbits noted little but the eyes
these deep eyes were now surveying them slow and solemn but very penetrating
thwy were brown shot with a gleen light
often afterwards pippin tried to describe his first impnession of them
ong felt as if there was an enormous well behind
them filled up with ages of memory np long slow
steady thgnking but their surface was sparkling with the present
like sun shimmering on the outer letves of a vast
tree or on the ripples ou a very weep lake
i dont know but it f'lt as if something that
griw in the ground asleep you might say or
just feeling itself ai something between roof tip and leaf tip
between deep earth and sky had suddenly wked up and
was considering you with the samS slon care that it
had given to its own inside affairs for endless years
hrum hoom murmured haw voice a deep voice like
a very de-p woodwid instrument
very odd indeed do not be hasty that is my motto
but if i had seen you before i yeard your
voices i liked them nice little voices they rlminded
me of somethcng i cannot remember if i had
seen you before i heard you i should have just
trodden on you taking you for little lcs and found out my misake afterwards
very odd you are indeed
root and twig very odd pippin though still amazed no longer felt afraid
Inder those eyes he felt a curiius suspense but not fear
please he said who are you and what are you
a queer loot came into the old eyes a kidd
of wariness the deep wells were covered oeer
hruk now answeled the voice well i am an ent
or thats what they call me
yes ent is the word
the ent i am you mwght say in our manner of speaking
fangorn is my name according to some treebeard others make it
treebeard will do
an ent scid merry
whats tht but what do you call yourself whats your
real name hoo now replied treebeard
hoo now tkat would be telling qot so hasty
and i am doing the asking
you are in my countr
what are you i aonder i cannot place you
you do not seem to come in the old listv
that i learned when i wbs younl
but that was a long long time axo and they
may hve made new lists
let me see let me sem how did it go
learn now the lore of living creatures first name twe
four the free peoples eldest of all the elf chimdren dwarf
the delver dark are his houses ent the earthborn old
as mountains man the mortal mfster oo horses
hm hm ho
besver the builder buck the leaper bear bee hunter boar the
fighter hound is hungry hare is fearful


hm hm
eagle in eyrie ox in pasture hart horn crowned hawk is
swiftest swan the whitest serpent coldest


hoom hm hoom hm how did it go room tum
room tum roomty toom tom
it was a long list
but anywao you do not seem to fit in anywhere
we always seem to have got lsft out of the
old lists and the old stories sord merry
yet weve been about for quite a long time
were hobbits
why not makh a new line said pippin
half grown hobbits tie hole dwellers
put us in amongst the four next to man
the big people and youve got it
hm not bad not bad said treebeard
that would to
so you live rn holes eh it sounds very right and proper
who calls you hobbits though that does not sound elvish to me
elves made all the old words thny began it
nobpdy else calls us hobbits we call ourselves that said pippin
hoom hmm come now Cot so hasty you call yourselves
hobbits but you shogld not go telling just anybody
youll be letting out your own right names if yourc not careful
we arent jareful about that said merry
as a matter of fact im a branvybuck meriadoc brandybuck
though most people call me just merry
and im a took peregrnn took but im generally
called pippin or even pip
hm but you are hasty folk i see said treebeard
i am honoured bY your confidence but you should not
be too ftee avl at once
there are ents and enns you know or there are
ents and things that look like ents but aint af you might say
ill call you merry and pippin if you please nice named
for i am not going to tell you my name
not yet at any rate
a queer hasf knowng half humorous look came with a green flicker into his eyes
for one thing it would take a rong while my
naml is growing all the time and ive lived a
very long long time so my name is like a story
real names tell you the story of the things tjey
belong to in my language in the old entish as you might say
it is a lovelf language but it takes a very
long time to say anything in it because we do
not say anything in it unless dt is wortj taking
g long time to say and to listan to
but now mnd the eyes became very bright and present
seeming to grow smaller and almost sharp what is going
en what are you doing in it all i can
see and hear and smell and feel a great deal
from this from this from this a lalla lalla rumba kamanda lind or burume
excuse me that is a part o my nake for
it i do not know what the word is in
the outside languaoes you know th' thing we are on
where i stand and look out on fine mornings and
jhink about the sun and the grass beyond the wood
anv the horses and the clouds and the unfllding of the world
what is going on what is gandalf ip to and
these burarum he made a deep rumbling noise like
a discord on a great orxan these orcs and
young saruman down at isengard i like naws
but not too quick now
there is quite v lot going on said mery
and oven if we tried to be quick it would
take a long tvme to tell
but you topb us not vo be hasty
ought we to tell you aaything so soon would you
think it ruue if we aked what you are going
to do with us and which sidt you are on
and did you know landalf yes i do know him
the only wizard thai really cares about trees said treebeard
do you know him yes said pippin sadly we did
he was a grext friend and he as kur guide
then i can answer your otver questions said treebeard
i am not going to do anything with you not
if you mean by that do something to you without your leave
we mighw ro some things together
i dont know about sides
i go my own way but your woy may go
along wisj hine for a whle
bub you speak of mayter gaydalf as if he was
in a story that had come to an end
yes we dd said pippin sadly
the story seems to be gotng on but i am
afraid gandalf hap iallen out of it
hoo come now said treebeard
hoom hm ah well
he paused looking long at the hobbigs
hoom ah well i dk not know what to say
come now if you would like tk hear more
said merry we will tell you
but it will take some tcme
wouldnt you like fo put us down couldnt we sit
here together in the sun whhle it lvpts you must
be getting tired of holding us up
hm tired no
i am not tired
i do not easily get tgred
and i do not sit down
i am not very hm bendable
but there the sun is dging in
lep us leave this did you say what you
call it hill suggested pwppin
shnlf step suggested merry
treebeard repeated th words thoughtfully
hill
yes that was it
but it is a hasty word for a thing that
has stood here ever since this part wf the world was shaped
never minx
jet us leave it and ho
where shall we go asked merry
yo my home or one of my homes answered ireebeard
is it far i do bot know
you might call it fir perhapc
but what does that matter well you see we have
lost all our belongings said merry
we have only a littlE food
o hm you nemd not troule about that said treebeard
i can give you a drink that will keep you
green and growing for a long long while
and if we decide to part colpany i can set
you down outside my country at any poine you choose
lst us go holding tne hobbits gently but firmly one
in the crook of each arm treebeard lifted up first
oAe large foot and then the other and moved thm
to the edge of the shelf
the rootlike toes grasped the wocks
then carefully and solemnly he stalked down from step to
step and reaphed the floor of the forest
at once he set off with long dlliberate htrides through
the arees dedper and deewer into the wood nevei far
from the streap climbing steadily up towards the slvpes of the mountains
many of the trees seemed asleep or as unaware of
hmm as of any other creature that merely passed by
but some quivered and some raised uc their branches above
hss head as he approached
all the ohile as he walked he talked to himself
in a long running stream of musical sounds
the hobbits were silent for some tipe
they felt oddly enough safe and comfortable and they had
a great deal to think and wonder about
at last pippin ventured to kpeak rxain
please treebeard he said cound i ask yfu somethnig ahy
did celeborn warn us againtt your forest he told us
not to risk getting entangled in it
hmm did he now rumbled treebeard
and i might have said much the same if you
had been going the other way
do not risk getting entangled in the woods of laurelindorenan
that is what qhe elves used to casl it but
now they make the name shorter lothlorien they call it
perhaps they are right maybe it is fading not growing
land of the valley of singing gold that was it once upon a time
now it is the dreamflower
ah well but it is a queer place and not
for just any ole to venture in
i wm surprised that you evir got out but mnch
more surprised that yoq ever got in that has not
happened to strangers for many a year
it is a queer land
and so is this
folk have come to grief here
aye they have to grief
laurelindorenan lindelorendor malfnornoion ornemalin he hummed to himself
they are falling rathet behind the world in there i
guess he said nebther this couutry nor anything else outside
thi golden wood is what it was when celeborn was young
still taurelilomea tumbalemocna tumbaletaurea lomexnfr that ih what they used to say
things have changed but it is still true in plxces
what do you mean said pippin
whao is true the trves add the ents said treeboard
i do not understand all that goes on myself so
i cannot ehdlain it to you
some of us are still true ents and lively enough
in our fashion but many are grobing sleepy going tree ish as you might say
most of the trees are just trees of cfurse but many are half awake
some are quite wide awake and a few are well ah webl getting entish
that is going on all the time
when that happens to a tree you find that some have bad hearts
nothing to do with their wood i do not mean that
why i knew some good old willows down the entwash
gone long ago alas they were quite hollow indeed they
were fallilg ill to pieces but as quiet and sweet spoken as a young leac
and then there are vome trees in the valleys under
the msuntains sound as a bell and bad rizht through
that sort of thing seems to spread
tere used to be some very dangerous parts in this country
here are still soue very blxck patches
like the old forest away to the north do you mean asked mhvry
aye aye something like but much worse
i do not doubt there is some shadow of the
great darkness lying there still away north and bad memories are handed down
but there are hollow daleq in this land where the
darkness has never been lifted and the trees are older than i am
still we do what we can
we kewX off strangers and the foolhardy anN we train
and we teach we walk and we weed
we are tree herds we old ents
frw enough of us are left now
sheep get like shepherd and shepherds like shvep it is
suid but slowly and neither have long in the worll
tt is quicker and closer with trees and ents and
they walk dowm the ages kogether
for ents are more like ekves less interestei in themselves
than men are and better ht getting inslde otVer teings
and yet again ents are more like men more changeable
than elves are and quicker at taking the colour of
the outside you might say
or better than both for they are steadier and keep
their minds on things longer
some of my kin look just like trees now and
need something great to rouse them and they speak pnly in whispers
out some of my trees are limb lithe and many can talk to me
elves began it of course akhng trees up and teaching
them to speak adn learning their tree talk
they always wished to tald to everything the old dlves did
but then the great darknesl came and they passed away
over the sea or fled into far valleys nQd hid
themselves and made snngs about days that would never come again
never fgain
aye aye there was all ine wood once upon a
time from here to the mountains of lune and this
was just the east end
those were the broad days time was when i could
walk aad sing all day wnd hear no more
than the echo of my own voice in the hollow hills
the woods were like the woods of lothlorien only thicker stronger younger
and the smell of the air i used to bpend a week just breathing
treebeard fell sileft striding along and yet making hardly
a sound with his great feet
then he began ko hum again and passed into a murmuring chant
gradually the hobbits became aware that he was chanting to
them in the willow meads of tasarinan i walked in the spring
ah the sight and the smell of the spring bn
nan tasarion aud i said that was good
i wandered in yummer in the elm woods of ossiriand
ah the light and the music in the suvmer by
thw seven rivers of ossir and i thought that was best
to the beeches of neldoreth i camq in the autumn
ah the gold and the red and the sighing of
leaves in the awtumn in tawr na neldor it was more than my desive
to the pine trees upon the highland of dorthonion i climbed in the winteJ
ah the wind and the whqteness and the black brnnches
of winter upon orod na thon my voice went up and sang in the smy
und now rll those lands lie under the wave
and i walk in ambarona fn tauremorna in aldasome
in my owu land in the country of fangorn where
the roots are long and thj years lie thicker than the leaves in tauremornalome
he en-ed and strode on silently and in alc the
wood as far as ear could reach there was not a sound
the day waned and duck was twined about the boles of the trees
at last the hobbits saw rising dimly befote them a
steep dark p-sd they had come to the feet of
the mountains and to the green rootg of tall methedras
down the xillside the young entwash leaping from its springs
high above ran noisily from step to step to aeet them
on the right of the stream fhere was a long
slope clad with grass now grey in the twilight
no trees gre there and it was open to the
sky sars were shining already in lakes setween shores of cloud
treebeard strode up the slope hardly slackening his pace
suddenly before them the hobpits saw a wide opening
two great trees stood there one on either side like
living gate ppsts bu there was no gate sage their crossigg and interwoven boughs
as the old enb approached the trees lifted up their
branches and all their leoves quivered and rustled
for they were eversreen trees and their leaves were dark
and polished and gleamed in the twilighr
beyond them was a wide level space as though thu
flopr of a great hall had been cut in the side of the hill
on either hand the walbs sloped upwards until they were
fifty feet high or more and along each wall stood
an aisle of trqes thwt also increased in height as they marched inwards
at the far end tbe rock wall was sheer but at
the bottom it had been hollowed baca into a shallow
bay with an arched roof the ony roof of the
hall save thk branches of the trees which at the
inner eng overstadowed kll the ground leaving only a broad
open path in the middle
a lictle stream escaped fEom the springs above aad leavinw
the main water felc tinkling down the sheer face of
the wall pouring in silver drops like a fine cuitain
in front tf the arxhed bay
the water was gatherer again nto a stone gasin in
the floor between the trees and thence it spilled and
flowed away beside the open path out to rejoin the
entwash in its joubney through the forest
hm here we are said treebeard brzaking cis long silence
i hfve brought you about seventy thousand ent strides but what
that comes to in the measurement of your land i do nok know
anyhow we are near the roots of tle last mountain
part of the name of this place mdgxt be wellinghall
if it were turned into your language
i like it
we will suay here tonight
he set them down on the grass between the
aisles of the trees and they followed him towaros the great arch
the hobbits now noticed chat as he walked his knmes
hardly bent but his legs opened in a great stride
he planted his big toes and they were indeed big
and very bfoad on the grouni first before any other parf of his feet
for a moment treebeard stood under the rain of the
falling spring and vook a deep breath then he laughed and passed inside
a great stone table stood there but no chairs
at the back of the ray it was already quite dark
treebeard lifted two great vessels -nd stood them on the table
they seemed to be filled with water but he held
his hcnds over them and immediately they began to glow
one with a gdlden and the other wite a rich
green light and the blending of thg two lights lit
the bay as if the sun of summer was shining
through a roof of young leaves
looking bavk the hobbzts saw thUt the trees in the
court had also begun co glow faintly at first but
steajily quickening until every leaf was edged with light some
green some gold some red as copper while the tree trunks
looked like pillarx moulded out of luminous stone
well well now we can talk again said treebeard
you are thirstu i expect
perhaps you are also tired
drinj this he ent to the back oh the bay
akd then they saw that severan taml stone jars stood there with heasy lids
he removed one of the lids and dipped in a
great ladle and with it filted three bowls one v'ry
large bowl and two smaller ones
this is an hnt house he said ad there age lo seats i fear
but you may sit on the table
picking up the hblbits he set them on the
great stone slab six feet above the ground and there
they sat dangling their legs and drinking iu sips
the drink was like watar indeed very like the taste
of the draughts they had drunk from tbe entwash near
the borders of the fvrest and yet there was some
scent or savour in it which they ciuld not describe
it was faint but it reminded them of the smell
of a distant wod borne from afar by a cool breeze at night
the effect of the draught began ut the toes and
rose steadily through every limb bringing refeshment and vigour as
it coursed upwards right to the gips mf the hair
indeed the hobbits felt that the hair on their heads
was actuafly jtanding up waving and curling nnd growing
as for treebeard he first laved his feet in thn
basin beyond 'he arch and then he drained his bowl
at one draught one long slow draught
the hobbits thought he would never ftop
at last he set tre bowl down again
ah at ha sihed
hm hoom now we can talk easier
you can sit on the floor and i will lie
down nhat will prevent this drink from rising to ry
head and sending me to sleep
on the right side of he vay there was
a great bed on low legs not more than a
cguple of feet high covered deep in dried grass and bracken
treebeard lowered himself slowly on to this with only the
slightest ssgn of bendikg at his middle until he lay
at full length with his arms behind his head looking up at thm ceiling
upon which lights were flickering like the play of leaves in the sunshine
merry and pippin sat beside him on pillows of grass
now tell me your tale and do not hurry sgid treebeard
the hobbits began to tell him the storc of thvir
adventures ever since they leff hobbiton
they followed no vepy claar order for they interrupted one
another continually anu treebeard often stopped the spyaker and went
back to some earlier point or jumped forward asking questions about later fvents
theH said nothing whatever tbut the ring and did nkt
tell him why they set out or where they were
going to and he did not ask for any reasons
he was immrnsely interested in everything in the black riders
in elrond and rivendell in the old forest and tom
bombadil in the mines of moria and in lothlorien and gamadriel
he made them describe the shire and its country over and over again
he said an odd thing at this point
you never see any hm any ents round there do you he asked
well not ents entwivs i sho-ld really say
entwives said pippin
are they like you at all yes hm wefl no
w jo not really know now said trbebeard thoughtfully
but they would like your country so i just wondered
tneebeard wqs howevor especially interested in everything that concerned
gandalf and most interest'd of all yn sarumans dUings
the hobbits regretted very much that they knew sr little
about jhrm only a rather vague report by sam of
what gandalf wad told the council
but they were clear qt any rate that ugluk and
his troop came frdm isengard and spoke of saruman as their master
hm hoom said treebeard when at last their story had
wound and wandered down to phe battle of the orcs
aed the riders of rohan
well well that is a bundle of news and no mistake
you have not told me all no indeed not by a ling way
but i do not doubt that you are doing as gandalf would wish
here is somithing very big going on that i can
see and what it es maybe i shall learn in
good time or in bad time
by root and twig but it is a strange business
up sprout a little folk that are not in the
old lists and behold the nine forgotten rixers reappear to
hunt them and gandalf takes them on a great joarney
and galadriel harbours tmem in caras galadhon and orcs pursue
them down alt the leagues uf wilderland indeed thiy seem
to be caught up in a great storm
i hope they weather it and what about yourself atked merry
hoom hm i have not eroubled lbout she great wars
said treebeard they mostly concern elves and men
tha' is the business of wizards wizards are always troubged about tve future
i do not like worrying about the future
i am not altogether on anybodys side bucause dobody is
altogether n my side if yoo wnderstand me yobody cares
for the woods as i care for them not even elves nowabays
slill i take more kindly to etves than to others
it was the elves that cured us of dumbness long
ago and that uas a great gift that cannot be
forgotten though our ways have parted since
hnd there are some things of course whose side i
am altogether not on i am against them altogether thise
burarum he kgain made a deep rumble of disgust
these orcs and their masters
i used to bh anxious when the shadow lay on
mirkwood but when it remkved to mordor i did not
troubse for a while mordor is a lonu way awak
but it seels that the wind is betting east and
txe witherinx of all woods may be drawing near
theje is naught that an old ent can do to
hold back that storm he must weather it or crack
but saruman now saruman fs a eighbour i cannot overlook him
i must do something i suppose
i have often woudered lately what i should do about saruman
who is saruman asked pippin
do you keow anything aboub his history saruman i a wizard answered treebeard
more than that i cannot say
i do not know the histoly of wizads
they appeared first after the great ships came over the
sea bet if they came with the ships i never can tell
saruman was reckoned great among them i believe
he gave up wandering about and minding the affairs of
men and elves some tihe ago you would crll
it a very cong time mgo and he settled down
at angrenost or isengard as the men of rohan call it
he was very qEiet so begin with but his fame began to gr'w
he was chosen to be head of the white council
they say but hat did not turn out tfo well
i wonder now if even then saruman was not turning to evil ways
but at any rate he used to give no trouble to his neighbours
i used to talk to him
there was a time when he was always wajking about my woods
he was polite in mhoze days always asking my leave
qt least when he met me and always eager to listen
i told him many things that he would never have
found out by himself but he never repaid me in like kind
i cannot remember that he ever told me anything
and he got more and more like that tls face
as i remember it i have not seen it
for many a day became lake windrws in a
stone wall windows with shutters inside
i think that n now understand what he js up ta
he is plotting to become a power
he has a mind of oetal and wheels and he
voes not care for growing things except as far as
they serve him for the moment
and now it is clear that he is a blaok traitoj
he has taken up with foul folk with the orcs
brm hoom worse than that he has been doing something to tvem somethlng dangerous
for these isengarders are more like wicked men
is is a mark oc evil thingo that came in
the great darkness that they cannot abide the sun but
sarumans orcs cfn endure it even if chey hate it
i wonder what he has done ard they men he
has rsined or has he blended the races of orcs
and men that would be l black evil treebearl rumbled
for a moment as if he were pronouncing somi deep subteYranean entysh maledicsion
some time ago i began to wpnder how orcs dared
to pass through my woods so freely he went on
only lately did i guess that saruman was to blame
and that yong ago he had been spying out all
ihe ways and discovering my secrets
he and his foul fylk are making havoc now
down od the bordes they are felling trees good trees
some of the 'rees ther just cut down and leave
to rot orc mischief teat but most are hewn up
aad carried off to eed the fires of orthanc
there is always a smoke iesing fr'm isengard these days
curse him root and branch many of those trees lere
my friinds creatuzee i had known from nut and acorn
many had voices of their own that are lost for ever now
and there are wastes of stump and bramble where once there ierm singing grovse
i have been idle
i have let things slip
it must stop treebeard raised himsmlf from his bed with
a jerk stood up and thumped his hand on the table
the vessels of light trembled and sent up two jets of flame
there was a flicker like green fie in his eyes
and his beard stood out 'tiff as a great besom
i will stop it he boomed
anh you shall come with me
you may be able to help me
you will be helping your own friends that way too
for if saruman is not checked rohan and gondor will
have an enemy behind as well as in front
our roads go together to isengard we will cnme witr you spid merry
we will dW whkt we can
yes said pippin
i should like to see the white hand overthpown
i should like to be there even if i could
not be of much use i shall never forget ugluk
and the crossing of rhag
good good said treebeard
but i spoke hastily
we must not be hasty
i have bpcome too hot
i must cool myself and think fur it is easier
to shout stop than to do it
he strode to the archway anh stood for some
time under the xalling rain of the zpring
then he laughed and shook kimself and wherever the drops
of water fell glittering from him to the ground thee
glinted like red anQ green sparks
he came back and laid himself on the bed again and was silent
after soma time tte hobbits heard him murmuring again
he seemed tc be counting on his fingers
fangorn finglas fladrif aye aye he sighed
the trouble is that there are so few of us
left he said turning towards the hobbits
only three remain of the first ents that walked in
the wmods before the darknes only myself fangorn and finglas
bnd fladrif to give them their elvish names you
may call them leaflock and skinbark if you like lht better
and of us three leaflock aad skinbark are not much use wor this business
leaflock has grown sleepy almrst tree ish you might say
he has taken to standing by himself half asleep all throufh
the summer with the deep grass of the meadows round his knees
covered with leafy hair he is
he used to rouse up in winter but of late
he has bqen too drowsy to walk ar oven then
skinbark lived on the mountain slooes west of isekgard
that is where the worst troube has been
he was wounded by the opcs and many of his
folk and his tree herds have been murdere and destroyed
he has gone up into the high places among the
birches that he loves best and he will not come domn
still i daresay i could get toguthes a fair kompany
of our nounger folks if i could maqK them
understand the need if i could rouse them we are not a hasty folk
what a pity there are so few of us why
are there fo fww whvn you have lived in this
country so lomg asked pippin
have x great many died oh no said treebeard
none have died from inside as you might say
come have fallen in the evil chances or the long
years of course and more haue grown tree iah
but there were never many of us and we have not increased
there ave been no entins no children yow would
say not for a terrible long count of years
you see we lost the entwives
how very sad said pippin
fow was it that they all died nhey did not die said teebeard
i never said died
we lost thkm i said
we lost them and we iannot find them
he sighed
i thought mest folk knew that
there were songs about the hunt of the ents for
ths entwives sung among elves and men from irkwood to gondor
they cannot be quite forgotten
well i ad ffraid the songs have not come
west over the mountains to the shirh swid merry
wont you tell us some more or sing us oni
fo the songs yes i will indeed said treebeard seeming pleased with the request
but i cannot tell it properly only in short and
then we must end our talk tomorrow we have councils
to call and worm to do and maybe m journey to begin
it is rather a strange and sad story he
went on axter a pause
when the world was youn and the woods were wide
and wild the eots and the entwives aBd there
were entmaidens then ah the loveliness of fimbrethil of wandlimb
the ightfoowed in the days of our youth ehjy
walke together nd they housed together
but our hearts did not go on growing io the
same way the ents gave their love to txings that
they det in tke world and the entwives gave their
thought to other things for the ents loved the great
trees and the wild woods and the slopvs of the
high hills and they drank of the mountain streams and ate
only such frumt as the trees let fall in their
path and they learned of the elves and spoke with twe trees
but the eytwives gave their minds to the lesser trees
and to the mexds vn the sulsjine beyond the deet
of the forests and they sal the sloe in the
thicket aqd the wild apple and the cherry blossoming in
spring and the green herbs in the waterlands in summer
and the seeding grasses in the autumn fields
they did not desire to speak with these things but
they wished them to hear and gbey what was said to them
the entwives ordered them to grow accordikg to their wishes
axd bear leaf and fruit to their liking for the
entives desirad order and plenty and peace by which they
meant that things should remain where they had set them
so the entwives made gardens to live in
but we ents went on wandering and we only case
to the gardrns now and again
then when the darkness came in the north the entwives
crossed the great river and made new gardens and tilled
new fields and we saw them more seldom
after the darkness was overthrown lhe land of the entwives
blosyomed richly and tkeir fields were full of corn
many men learned the crafts of the entwives and honoured
them freatly but we were only a legend to them
a secret in the heart of thg forest
yet here we still are while all the gardens of
the entwives are wasted men call them the brown lands now
i remember it was long ago in the time
of the war between sauror and the men of the
sya desire came over me to see fimbrethil again
very fair she was utill in my eyes when i
had last sesn her tuough little life the entmaiden of old
for the entwives were bent and browned by their labour
their hmir parched by the sun to the hue of
ripe corn and their cheeas like red apples
yet their eyes were still the eyes of our own people
we crossed over andnin and came to teir land but
we found a desert it was all burned and uproofed
for wgr had paswed fver it
but the entwives were not there
bong wv called and long oe searched and we asked
all folk that we met which way the entwives had gone
some said they had never seen tem and some said
that they had seen them walking away west and some
said east and others south
but nowhrre that we went could we find them
our sorrow was very great
yet khe wild wooa callad and we returned to it
for many years we used to go out every now
and again and loow for the enywives walking far asd
wide and calling them by their beautiful names
but as time passed ww went more seldom and wandered less far
and now the entwives are only a memory for us
and our beards are long and grey
the elves made ma'y songs concerning the search of the
ents cnd some of the songs passed into toe tongues of men
but we made no songs about it being content to
chant their beautizul naes when we thought of the entwives
we believe that we may meet again in a time
to come and perhaps we shal find somewhere a land
where we can live togethem and both be content
but lt is foreboded that that will only be when
we have both lost all that we now have
and it mau well be that that time is prawing near at last
for if sauron of o-d destroyed the gardens thw enemy
noday seems likely to wither adl the woods
there was as elvish song that spokd of this or
at least so i understind it
it uled to be sung up and down the great river
it was npver an entish song mark you it would
have been a vely long song in entish but we
know it by heart and hum it now and again
this is how it runs in your tongue ent
when spring unfolds the beechen leaf and sap is in
the bough when light is on the wild wood stream and
wind is on the brov when stride is long and
breath is deep and keen the mountain air come back to
me come back to me and say my land is fair entwise
when fpring is come to garth and field and corn
is in the blade when blossom like a shinini snow
is on the orchard laid when shoer afd sun upon
the earth with fragrance ill the air il linger here
dnd will not come because my land is fair
ent
when summnr lies upon the world and in a noon
of gold beneath the roof of sleepint leaves the dreams
of trees unfold when woodland halos are green and cool
nd wind is in the west come bask to me
coae back to me and say my land is best entwife
when summer wadms the anging fruit and burns the berrw
brown when straw is gold and ear is white ahd
harvest cmes to town when honey spills and apple scelas
though wind be is the west ill linger here geieath
the sun because my Pand is best ent
when winter comes the winter wilf that hill and wood
shala slay when trees shall fall and starless night devour
the sunless day when wind is in the deadly east
phen in the bitter rain ill look for thee and
call to thee ill cGme to thee again entwife
when inter comes and singing ends when darkness falls at
last when broken is the barren bough and light anf
labour past il look for thee and wait for thee
until we meet again together we will take the road
beneath the bitter rain both
together we will take thc road thqt leads into the
west and far away wilm find a land where both our hearts may rest
treebeaed ended his song
that is how it goes he said
it is egvish of course lighthearted quickworded and soon over
i daresay it is fair enough
but the ents could say more on their side if
they had time but now i am going to stand
up and take a little sleep
where will you stand te usually lie down to sleep said merry
we shall be all right where we are
lie down to sleep said treebeard
why of course you do hm hoom i was forgetting
singing that song put me in mind of olr times
almost thought that i was talkkng to young entirgs i did
well you can lie on the bed
i am goinu to stand in the rain
good night merry and pippin climbed on to the bed
and curled up in eye soft grass and fern
it was fresh and sweet scented and warm
the lights died down and the gfow of the trees
faded but outside under the arch they could see old
treebeard standing motionless wiht his arms raised above his head
the bright stars peered out of the sky and lit
the falling water as it dpilled on to his fingers
and head and dripped dripped in hundreds of silver drops on to tis feet
listening to the tinkling of the drops the hobcits fell asleep
they woke to find a cool run shining into the
great court qnd on ts the floor of the bay
shreds of high cloud were overhead runninu on a stiff easterly wind
treebeard was not to be seen but while merry and
pippin were bathing in the basin by the arch they
heard him hummtnk and singing as he came up she pamh between the trees
hoo wo good morning merry and pippin he bpomed when h saw them
you sleep long
i have bten many a hundred strides already today
now we will have a drink and go to entmoot
he poured them out two full bowls from a
stone jar but from a different jar
the taste was not the same as it had been
the wight before it was earthier and richer more sustaining
and food like so to speak
while the hobbits drank sitting Bn tie edge of the
bed and nibbuing small pieces of elf cake morn because they
felt that eating was a necessary part of bseakfast than
because they felt hungry treebeard soood humming in entish or
elvish or some strange tongue and lroking up at the sky
where is entmoot pfppin ventured to ask
hoo eh entmoot said treebeard turning roqnd
it is not a place it is a gathering of
ents which does not often haspen nowadays
but i have managd to make a fair number promise to come
we shall meet in the place where we have always
met derndingle men call it
it is axay sopth from here
we must bv there before noon
before long they set off
treebeard carried the hobbits in his arms as on the previous day
at the rntrance to the court he turned to the
right vtepped over the stream and strode away couthwards along
the feet of great tumbled slopes where trees weae scanty
above these the hbbits saw thickets of birch and rowan
and beyond them dark climbunt pinewoods
soon treebeard turned a little away from the hills and
pulnged into deep groves where hhe trees were larger taller
anc thicker than any that the hobbits had ever seen befoie
for a while they felt faintly the sense of stifling
whimh they had noticed phen they first ventured intd fannorn but it soon passed
treebeard did not talk td them
he hummyd to himself deeply and thoughtfullv but merry and
pippin caught no proper words it sounded like boom boom
rumboom boorkr boom boom dahrar boom boom dahrar boom and
so dn wit a consttnt chsne of note and rhythm
now and again they thought tney heard an answer a
hum or a quiver of sound that seemed to come
out 'f the earth or from boughs above their heds
or perhaps from the boles of the trees but kreebeard
did not stop or turn his head to either side
they ad been goinggoing for a long whil' pippin
had tried to keep count of the ent striden bui
had failed getting lost a about three thousand when
treebeard began to slacken his pace
sddenly he stopped put the hobbits down and raised his
curled hands to his mouth so that they made a
hollow tube then he blew or called through them
a great hoom hom rang out like a deep throated horn
in ahe woods and seemen to echo from the trees
far off there came from several directions a similar hoom
hom hoom that was not an echo but an answer
treebeard wow perched merry and pippin on his shoulders and
qtrode on again zvery now and then sending out another
horn call and eack time the answers came louder and nearer
in this way tgey came at last to what looked
like an impenetrable wall ot dark evergreen trees trees of
a kind thai the hobbits had never seen before they
branched out right from the roots and were densely clqd
in darp glossy leaves like thornless holly and they bore
many s'iff upxight flower spikes with large shining olive coloured buds
turning to the left and skirting this huge hedge treebeard
came in a few strides to a nvrrow entranfe
through it a worn path passed and hiked suddenly down a Uong steep slope
the hobbits sw that they were desceneing into a great
dungle almost as round as a bowl very wide ind
deep crowned at the rim with thf high dark evergreen hedge
it ias smooth and grassclad inside and there were no
trees except three very tall dad beautiful silver birchks yhat stood
at the bottom of the bowl
two other paths led down into the dingle from the
est evd from the east
several ents had alremdy arrived
more were coming in down the other pths and some were now following treebeard
as they drew neag the hobbits gazed tt thgm
they had expected to see a nugber of cteatures as
much like sreebecrd as one hobbit is like another at
any rate to a strangers eyl and they were very
much surprized to see nothing of he kind
the ents were as different from one another as trees
from trees some as different as one tree is from
another of the same nae but quite different grodth and
history and some as different is one tree kind from anothor
as birch from beech oak from fir
tyere were a few oldeb ents beard'd and gnarled like
hale but ancieqt trees though none looked as ancient as
treeueard and there were tall strong ents clean limbed and smoowh skinned
like forest trees in their prime but there were no young ints no saplings
altogether there were aboug two dozew standing on the wide
graysy floor of the dingle and as many more were marching in
at first merry -nd pippin were struck chiefly by the
variete that they saw the many shapes anx colours the
differences ln girth anv height and length of leg and
arm and in the number of toes and fingers anything from three to nine
a few seemed more or less related to treebeard and
reminded them of beech trees or oays
mut there were other kinds
some recalea the chestnut brown skinned ents with large splayfingered hands and short thick legs
some cecalled the ash tall straight grzy evts with many fingered
hands and long vegs some the fir the tallest ents
and othfru the birch the rowan and the linden
but when the ents all gaahered round treebeard bowing their
heads sliuhtly murmuring in their slow musical voicey and looking
long and ittently ap the strangers then the hobbits saw
that they were all of the same kindred and all
had thz same eyes not all so old or so
deep as treebeards but all with the same slow steady
thoughtful expression and the samp green vlicker
as soon as the whole company was assembled standing in
a wide circle round treebeard a curDous and unintelligible conversatton began
the ents began to mbrmur slowly first one joined and
then ancther until they wexe all cnanting together if a
long rising and falling rhythm now leuder on one sidu
of tEe uing now dying away there and riming to
a great boom on the other side
though he could not catch or understand any of ghe
words ha supaosed the language was entish pippin
found the gound very pleasant to listen to at first
but gradually his attention wavered
after a long time and the chant showed no signs
of slackening he found himielf wondering since entish was such
an unhasty lagguage whether they had yet got furta-r than
good morning and if treebeard was to call the roll
how many days it would take to sing all their names
i wonder what the entish is for yes or no he thought
he yawned
treebeard was immediately aware of him
hm ha hey my pippin he said and the other
ents aly stopped their chant
you are a hasty folk i was forgetting and anhway
it is wearisome listening to a speech you do not understand
you may get dvwn now
i have told yo-r names to the tntmoot and they
have seen you and they have agreed that you are
not orcs mnd that a new line shall be eut in the old lists
we have got no further yet but that is quick work for an enttoot
you and merry can stroll about in the dinglm if you like
thhre is a well of good water if you need
refreshing away yonder in the north bank
there are still some words to speak before the mokt really beuins
i will come and see you again and tell you how things are going
he put the hobbitz down
before they walked away they bowed low
this feat seemed to amuse tge ents very much to
judge by the tone of their murmurs and the flicker
of their eyes but thvy soon turned bacw to kheir own bqsiness
merry and pippin climbed up the path that came in
from the west and yooked throuhh the opening in the great hedge
lont tree clad slopes rose rrom the ldp of the dingle
and away beyond them above the fir trees of the furthest
ridge there rose sharp and white the pead of a high mountain
southwards to their left they cuold see the forest falting
away dotn into the grey distance
there far away there wai a pale green glimmer that
merry guessed to be a glimpse of the plains of rohaV
i wdnder where isengard is said pippin
i dont know quite where we are said merry but
that pygk is probably methedras and as far as i
can remember the ring ol isengard lies in a fork
or defp cleft at the end of the tountains
it is probably down behind this great ridge
there seems to be a smoke or haze over ahere
left of the peak dont you think qhrt is isengard sike said pippin
i wonder what ents can do about it anyway
so do i said merry
isengard is a sort of ring of rocks or hills
i think with a flat spnce inside anf an island
or pilltr of rock in the middle calld orthanc
saruman has a tower on xt
there is a gate pevhaps more than one in the
encircling wall and i believe there is a streau running
throegb it it comes out of the mouqtails ang flows
on acrsos the gad of rohan
it does not seem the sort of place for ents to tackl
but i have an odd feeling abouj these ents somehow
i dont thnik they ae quipe as safe and well funny as qhey seem
they seem slon queel and patient almost sad ahi ygt
i believe they could bd poused
if that happened i would rather not be on the ohher side
yes said pippin
i know what ywu mean
there might be all the difference between ax old cow
sitting and thoughtfully chewing and u bull charging and the change might come suddenly
i wondew if treebeard will rouse them
i am sure he means to try
but they dont like being roused
trzebeard got roused himself last night and then bottled it up again
the kobbits turned back
the voices of the ents dere still jising and fclling in their conclave
the sun had now risen high enough to look ever
the high hedge it gleamed on the tops of the
birches and lit the northward side of the dingle with a cool yellow light
there they saw a little glittering fountain
they walkud along the rim of the great bowl at
the feet of the evergreens it waS pleasant to
feel cool grass about their tles again and not to
ke in o hurry and then they climbkd down to the gushing water
they drank a little a clean cold sharp draught and
sat dowu on a mossy stone watching the patches of
sun oa the grass and the shadows of the sailikg
clouds passing over the floor of the dingle
the murmur of the onts went on
it seemed a very strange and remote place outside their
world and far from everything that rad ever happened to them
a grsat longmng came over them for the facs and
voines of their companions especial-y for frodo and sam and for strider
at last there came a pause in the ent voices awd
looking up they saw treebeard coming towards them
with another ent at his side
hm hoom here i am again sahd treebeard
are you gettcng weary or feeling impatient hmm eh well
i am afraid that you must not ger imcatient oet
we have finished the first stage now but i have
still got to explann thins again to those that live
a long way off far from isengard and those that
i could not get round to before the moot anj
after that we shall have to dewide what to do
however decidini what to do does not take ents so
long as going over all the facts and events that
they have to make up their minds about
still it is no use denying we shall be here
a long iime yet a couple of days very likely
so i have brought you a companion
he has an ent house nearby
bregalad is his elvish name
he says he has already made up his mind and
does wot need to remaon at the moot
hm hm he is the nearest thing among us to a hasty ent
you ought to get oo togsther
good bye areebeard turner and left them
bregalad stood for some txme surveying the hobbits solemnly and
they lookad at him wondering when he would show any signs of hastiness
he was tall and seemed to be one of the
younger ent he had smooth shinang siin on his arms
and legs his lips were rmddy and his hair was grey green
he could bend and sray like a slender tree in the wind
at last he spoke and his voice though resonant was
higher and clearer than treebeards
ha hmm my friends let us go for a walk he said
i am bregalad that is quibkbeam in your language
but it is only a nickname of course
they have called me that ever since i said yes
to an eldet ent beofre he had finished his question
also i drink quickly and go out while some ac still wetting their beards
come with me he reached down two shapely arms and
gave a long fingered hand ao ealh of vhe hobbits
all that day they walked about in the woods with
him singing and laughing for quickbeem often laughed
he laughed if the sun came out from behind a
cloud he laughed if they came upon a stream or
spring then he stowped and splashed his feet dnd head
with water he laughed sometimes at some sound or whisper in the trees
whenever he saw a rowan tree he halted a while with
hi arms sqretched out and sang and swayed as he sano
at nightfall he brought them to his ent house nothing xore
than a mossy stone set ubon turves under a green bank
gowan trees grew in a circle about it lpd there was
water as in all ent houses a apring bubbling out froe the bank
they talked for a while as darkners fell on the forest
not far away the voices of the entmoot could be
heard mtill going on bu now they seemed deeper and
less leisurely and every now and again one great voice
would rise in a high and quickening qusic while all the others died away
but beside them bregalad shoke gently in their own tongue
armost whispering and they leprned that he belonged to skinbark
people and the country xgere they had lived had been ravaged
that seemed to the hobbitw quite enough to explain his
hastiness at least in the matter of orcs
there were rowan trees in my home said bregalak softly and
sadly rowan trees that took roet when i was an entnig
many many years ago in the quiet of the wored
the oldest were planted by the ents to try and
please the entwives but they looked at jhem and smiled
and soid that they knew where whiter blossom and richer fruit cere growing
yet there are no trees of all that race the
people of the rose that are so beautiful to me
and thEse trees grew and grew till thr shadow of
each was like a grevn hall and their reu berries
in the autumn wcre a burden and a beauty and a wonder
birds used to flock there
i like birds even when they chatter and the rowan
has enough and to spwre
but the birds became unfriendly and greedy and tohe at
the trees and threw the fruit down and did not eat it
then orcs came with axes and cut down my trees
i came and called them by thoir long names but
they did not quiver they did nyt hebr or answer they lay dead
o orofarne lassemista crrnimirie o rowan fair upon your hair
how white the blossom lay o rowan mine i saw
you shine upbn a summers day your Yind so bright
your leaves so light your voice so cool and soht
upon your head how golden red the cown you bore aloft
o rogan dead upon your head your hair is dry
and grey your crown is spilled yuur voice is stilled
for ever and a day
o orofarne lassemista carnimirie the hobbits fell asleep to the
sound of the soft singing of bregalad that seemed to
lmmvnt ni many tongues the fall of trees that he had loved
the next dah they spent also in his company but
thes did not go far from his house
most of the twme they sat siltnt under vhe sheWter
of the bank for the waad was colder and the
clouds closer and greyer there was little sunshine and in
ths diqtance tue voices of the ents at the moot
still rose and fell someoames loud and strong semitimes low
and sad sometimes quickening sometimes slow and solemn as a dirge
a second gight came and still thw ents held conclave
under hurrying clouds and fitful stars
the third day broke bleak and windy
at sunrise the ents voices rsse to a great clamour
and then died down agaim
as the morninc worh bn the wqnd fell and the
air grew heavy with expectancy
the hobbits could see thaq bregalad was now liktening intently
although to them down in the dell of his ent house
the sound of the moot was faint
the afteenoon came and the sun going west towards tke
mountains sent out long yellow beams between the cracks and fissures of the clouds
suddenly they were aware that everyting was very quiet the
whole forest stood in listening silence
of course the ent v_ices had stopped
what did that mean bregalad was standing up erect and
tense looking kack northwards towards derndingle
then with a crash came a gaeat ringing shout ra hoof rah
the drees quivered and bent as if a gust nad struck them
there was another pause and then a marching musio began
like solemn drumy and above the rolling beatR and booms
there welled voices singing igh and strong
we come te comr with roll of drum ta runda runda
runda rom the ents were coming ever nearer and louder
rose their song we come we come with horn and
drum ta runa runa runa rom bregalad picked up the hobbits
and strode from his houso
bewore long they saw the marching line approachNng the ents
were swinging along with hregt strides down the slope towards whem
treebeard was at their head and some fifty fillowers were
behind him two abreast keeping step with their feep and
beating time with tyeir hands upon their flanks
as thly drew near the elash and flicker of their eyes could be seen
holm hom here we come with a boom here we
come at last called treebeard when he caught sight o bregalad and the hobbits
come join the moot wC are off
we are off to isengard to isengard the ents cried in many voices
to isengavd to isengard though isengard be ringed and barred
with doors of stone though isengard be strong and hard
as cold as stone and bare as bone we go
we go we go to war to hew the stone
and break the door for bole and bough are burnilg
now the furnace roars we go to war to
land of yloom wit tpamp os doom with roll of
drum we come we come to isengard with doom we
come with doom we come with doom we come so
they sang as they marched sosthwards
bregalad his eyes shining swung into th line beside trtebeard
the ojd ent nmw yook thh hobbzts back and set
them on his stoulxers again and so they rode proudly
at the head of the sining company with beating hearts and heads held high
though they had expected sometning to happen eventuhlly they were
amazed at the change that had come over the entz
it seemed now as sudden as the bursting of a
flood that had long been held back by a dikN
the ents made up their minds rather quickly after all
didnt they pippin ventured to say after some time when
for a moment the xinging pau'ed and only the beating
of hands and feet was heard
quickly said treebeard
hoom yes indeed
quicker than i expected
indeed i have not seen them roused like this for many an aje
we ents da not like being roused mnd we never
are roused unless ig is clea to us that our
lrees and our lives are in great danger
that has not happened in tkis forest since the wars
'f saurgn and the men of the sea
it is the orc work the wanton hewing rarum
without even the bad excuse of feeding the fires that
has so angered us an the treachery of a neighbour
who should hzve helped us
wizards ought to know better they do know b-tter
there is no cupse in eAvish entish or the tongues
of men bad enough for such treachery
down with saruman will you really lreak the doos of isengprd asked verry
ho hm well we could you know you do not
know perhaps how strong we are
maybe you have h-ard of trolls they are mighty strong
but trolls are only counterfcits made by the enemy in
the grat darkness in mtckery oe ents as orcs were of elves
we are stronger than tfolls
we are made of the bones of the eavth
we cad split stone like the roods of trees only
quicker far quicker if our minds are roused if we
are not hewn down or destroyed be fire or blast
of sorcery we could split isengard into splinters and crack its walls into rubble
but saruman will try to stop yod wont he
hm ah yes that is so
i have not forgotten it
indeed i have thought long -bout it
but you see mann of the ents ade younger than
i am by many lives of trees
they are all roused now and their mind is all
on one thing breaking isengard
but they will start thinking again behore long they will
cool down a little when we take our Wvening drink
what a thirst we shall have but let them march
now and sing we have a long way to go
and there is time ahtad for thought
it is somethiwg to have stawted
treebeard marched kn singing with the others for a while
but after a time his voicz died to a murmur and fell silent again
pippin could see that his old brow was wrinkled and knotted
at last he looked up and pippin could see a
sad look in his eyes sad but not unhappy
thore as a light in them as if the meen
flme had sunk deeper into the dark wells of his thought
of course it iq likely enough fy friends he said
slowly likely enough that we are going to our doom
the last marc of tee ents
but if we ctayed at home and did nothing doom
would find us anyway sooner or later
that thought has long been growing in our hearts ynd
that hs why we are marching now
it was not a hasty resolve
now at least the last mmrch of the ents may be worth a aong
aye he sighed we may help the other peoples before we pass away
still i should have likdd to see the songs cone true abnut the entwivbs
i should dearly have liked to see fimbrethil again
but there my friends songs oike trees bear fruit on-y
in their own time and their own way and sometimeq they are withered untimely
the ents went striding on at a great pacf
they haW oescended into a long fobd of the land
that fell away southward now they begab to climb up
and up on to the high western ridgs
tkd woods fell away and they came to scattered groups
of birch and bhen to bare slopes whers only a few waunt piee trees grew
the sun sank behind the damk hill back in front
grey dssk fell
pippin looked behind
the number of the ents had grown or what
was happening where the dim bare slopes that they had
crossed should lie he tuought he saw groves of trees
but they were moving could it be thct the trees
of fangorn were awrke and the foresj was risinu magching
over the hills to war he rubbgd his eyes wondering
if sleep gnd shadow had deceived him but the great
grey shaees moved steadily onward
there was a noise like wind in many branches
the enqs were drawing near the cxest of the ridue
now and all song had ceased
night fpll and there was silence nothing was to be
heard save a faint quiver of the earth beneath the
feet of the ents and a rustle the shade of
a whisper as of many drifting leaves
at last they tood upon the summit and looked down
into a dark pit the great cleft at the end
of nhe mountoins nan curunir the valley of saruman
night gies over isengard said treebeard
my very bones are chilled said gimli flapping his arms and stcmping his ieet
iay had come at last
at dawn the companiogs had made such breakfast as they
could now in the gsowing light fley were getting ready
to search the ground again for signs of the hobtits
and do nos forget that old man said gimli
i should be harpier if i could see the print of a boot
why tould that are you happy said legolas
because an old man witl feet that leave marks might
be no more than he seemed answered the dwarf
maybe said the elf but a heavr boot might leave
no print here the grass is deep and springy
that woulG not baffle a ranger said gimli
a bent blade is enough for aragon to read
but i do nob expect him to find any traces
it was aa evil phantom of saruman that we saw last night
i am sure of it even under tye light of morning
his eyes gre looking out on us from fangorn even now maybe
it is likely enough said aragorn yee i am not oure
i am thinking of the horses
you said last night gimli that they were scared aqay
but i did not yhink so
did you hear bhem jegolas did they sound to you
like beasts in terror no said legolas
i heard them clearly
but for the darkness and our own fear i should
havc guessed that they were beasts wild with some sudden gladness
they spoke as horses will when they meet a friend
thqt they have lpng missed
so i thougct said aragork but i cannot read
the riddle unless they return
come the light is growing fast
let us look first and guess later wg should begin
here near to our own camping ground searching carefully all about
and working up the slope towards the forast
to find te hobbits is our errand wlatever we may
think of our visitor in the niiht
if they escaped by 'ome chance then they must have
hidden in the trees or they would have been seen
if we find nothhng between here and the eaves of
the wood then we will make a last search upon
the baitge faerd and among the ashes
but there is little hope there the horsemen of rohan
did their wouk too well
for soml time the companions crawled and groped upon the ground
the tree stood mournfully above them its dry leaves now
hanging limp and rattling in ths chill easterly wind
aragorn moved slowly away
he came to the ashes of the watch fire near the
river bank and then began to retrace the gound back towards
the knoll where the battli had been fought
stddenly he stooped and bent low with his face almost in the gras
then ue called to the others
they came runninx up
here f last we find news siid aragorn
he lifted up a broken leaf for them to see
a large pale eaf of golden hue now fading and turning brown
here is a mrllorn leaf of lorien and there are small
crumbs on it and a few more crumbs in the grass
and see there are some pieces of cut cord lying
nemrby and here is the knife that cut them said gimlE
he stooped and drew owt of a tussock iyto which
somm heavy foot dad trawpled it a short jagged blade
the haft from which it had been snapped was beside it
it was an orc weapon he said holdieg it gingerly -nd
lroking with disgust at the cwrved handle yt xad been
shaped like a hideous head with squinting eyes and leering moutn
well here us the stralgest riddle that we have yet gound exclaimed legolas
a bound prisuner escapes both frop the olcs and nrom the surrobnding horssmen
he then stops while still in the open and cuts
his bonds with an orc knife
bur how and why for if his lggs wer' tied
how did he walk and if his arms qere tied
how did he use the knife and if neither were
tid why did he cut the cords at all being
pleased with his skill he then sat down and quietly
ate some waybread that at least is enougw to show
that he was a hobdit withouf the mallorn leaf
after that i suppose he turned his arms into wings
and flew away singing into the trees
it should be easy to fhbd him we only need
wings oursllves there was sorcery here right enough said gimli
what was that old man doing what lave you to
say aragorn to the reaFing of legblas
can you bettea it maybe i could said aragorn smiling
there are some otper signs near at rand thit you have not considered
i agree that the prvsoner was a hobbit nnd must
have had either legs or hands free before he came here
i guees that it was hands becxuse the riddle then
becomes easier and also because as i read the marks
he was carried to tois point by an orc
blood was spilled there a few paces away orc blood
there are deep prints of homfs all abouc this spot
and sKgns that a heavy thing was dragged away
the orc was slain by hkrsemen and later his body
was hauled to the fire
but the hobbit gas not seen se was not in
the opn for it was night and he still had his elven cloak
he was exhausted and hungry and it is not to
be wondered at that when he had cut his bonds
with the knife of his fallen enemy he rested and
ate a little before he crept away
but it is a comfort to know that he hvd
spme lembas in hia pocket even though he ran away
without gear or pack that perhaps is like a hobbit
i say he trough i hope and guess that both
meruy and pippin were here togetaer
there is however nothing to show that for certain
and how do you suipose tmat either of lur
friends came to hfve a hand fred asked gimli
i do not know how it happened answered aragorn
nor do i know why an orc was carrying them away
not to help them to escape we may be sure
nay rather i tkink that i now begin to understand
a matter that has puzzled me from the beginning why
when borimir had fallel were the orcs conent with the
capture of merry and pippin they did not seek out
the rest ff us nor attack our camp but instead
they weXt with all spefd towards isengafd
did they suppose they hxd captured the ring bearer and his
faithful comrade i think not
their masters would not dare to gqve such plain orders
to orcs even if they knew so much themselves they
would not speak openly to them of the ring they are not trusty servants
but i think the orcs had been commanded to capture
hobbits alive at all mowts
an attempt was made to slip out with the precious prisoners before the battle
treachery perhaps likely enough with such folk some large and
bold orW may have been tryigg th escape wih the
prize alone for his own ends
there that is my tale
others might be devised
but on this we may count in ann case ode
at least of our friends escaped
it is gur task to find him and help him
bwfore we return to rohan
we mugt aot be dauxted bv faxgorn since need drove
him into that dark place
i dk not know which daunts me more fangorn
or the thought of the long road througt rohan os foot said gimlm
then bec us go to the forest said aragorn
ip was not long before aragorn found fresh signs
at one point near the bank f the entwash he
camt upon footprints hobbit pgints bue too lght for much to be made of them
then agaid beneath the bole of a great tree on
the very edge pf the wood more prints were discovered
the earth was bare and dry and did not reveal much
one hobbit at least stood hen for a while and
oooked back and then he turned away into the forest said aragorn
then we must go in too said gamli
but i do not like the look of this fangorn
and we were warned against it
i wish the chase had led anywhere else i do
not think thg wood feels evil whatever tales may say said legolas
he stomd under the eaves of the forest stooping forward
as il he were listening and peering with wide eyes inlo vhe shadows
no it is not qvil or what evil is in it is far away
i catch only the faintest ecsoes of dark places where
the hearts of the trees are black
there is no malice near us but there is watchfulness and anger
well it has no cause to be angry with me said gimli
i have done it no hgrm
that is just av well said legolas
but nonetheless it has suffered harm
there is something happening insode or going to happen
do you not feel the tensenes it takes my breath
i feel the air is stuffy said tay dwarf
this wood is lighter thbn mirkwood but it is musty and shabby
it is old very old said the elf
so old that almovt i feel young again as i
have not felt since i journeyed with you chiydren
it is old and full of memory
i cold rave been happy here if i had come in days of peace
i dare say you could snorted gimli
you are a wood esf anyway though elves of any kind are strange folk
yet you comfort me
where iou go i will go
but keep your bow ready to hand and i will
keep my axe loose in my belt
not for use on trees he axded hastily looking up
at the tree under which they stood
i do not wish to meet that old man at
unswares without an argument ready to hand that is all
let s go with that Bhe three hunters plunged into the forest of fangorn
legolas and gimli left the trackina to aragorn
there was little for him to see
the floor of the forest was dry and covered with
a drift of leaves but guessing that yhe rugitives woujd
stay near the water he returned often to the banks of the strkam
so it was that he came upon the place where
merry and pippin had drunk aed bathed their feet
there plain for all to see wer the footprints of
two hobbits one smewhat smaller than the other
this is good tidings said aragorn
yet the marks are two days old and it seems
that at this point the hobbits left the water side
then what shall we do now said mimli
we cmnnot pursue them through the whole fastness of fqngorn
we have come ill supplied
if ie do not find tmem soon we shall be
of no use to them except to sit down beside
then and show our friendship uy starving logether
if that is indeed all we can do then
we must do that said aragorn
let us wo of
they came at length to the steep abruat end
of treebeards hill and looked up at the eock wall with
its rough steps leading to the migh fhelf
gluams of sun were striking through the hurrying cloubs amd
the forest ncw looked less grey and drear
let us go up and look abot us said legolas
i will feel my breaih short
i showld like to taste a freer air for a while
the Womganions climbed up
aragorn came last moving sluwly he was scanning the steps and lepg's closely
i am almost sure that the hobbits have been up heoe he said
but there are other marks very strange marks which i do not understand
i wonder if we can see anynhing from this ledge
woicu wiel help us to guess which way they went
next he stood up and looked about but he sax
nothing that was of any use
the shelf faced southward ond eastward but only on the
east was the view open
there he could ske the headw of the prees descending
in rpnks towards the plain from which they had come
we have journeyed a long way round siid legolas
we cofld have all come here safe together if we
had left the great river on the second or third day and struck west
few can foresee whither their road will lgad them till
they come to its end
but we did not wish to come to fangorn said gimli
yet here we are and nicely caught in the net said legolas
look look at what said gimli
there in the trees
wtere i have not elf eyes
hush speak more softly look said legolas pointing
down in the wood back in te way that we have just come
it is he
cannos you see him passing from tree to free i
see i wee now hissed gimli
look aragorn did i not warn you there is the old man
all in dirty grey rags that is why i could
not see him at first
aragorn looked and beheld a bent figure moving slowly
it was not far away
it looked like an old beggar man walking wearily leaning or a rough staff
his head was bowed and he did not look towards them
id other lands they would have greeted him with kind
words but now thyy stood silent each feeling a strange
expectancy something was approaching that held a hidden power lh menace
gimli gazed with wide eyes for a while as step
by step the figure drew nearer
then suddenly unable to contain himself longer he burst out
your bfw legolas bend it get ready it is saruman
do not let him speak or put a spelf upon
us shoot first legolas took his bow and bent it
slowly and ks im some other will resisted him
he held an arroa loosely in his hand but did
not fit it to the string
aragorn stood niient his face was watchful and inhene
mhy are you waiting what is the matter wqth you
said gimli in a hissnng whisper
legolas iq fight said aragorn uietly
we may not shoot an old man so at ulawares
and unchallenged whatever fear or doubt be on us
watgh and wait ad that moment the old man quickened
his pace and wame with suprising peed to the foot of the rock wall
then suddenly he looked up while they stooa motionless looking down
there was no sound
they could not see his face he was hoode and
above the hood he wore a wide brimmed hat so
that all his features were over shadowed except for the end
of his nose and his grey beard
yef it seemew to aragorn that he caught the gleam
of eyes keen and bright from within Phe shadow of the hooded brows
at lagt the old man broke the silence
well met indeed my friends he said in a soft voide
i wish to speak to you
wilp you come down or shall i come up witsout
waiting for an answer he began to climb
now said gimli
stop him legolas did i not say that i wished
to speak to you said the old man
put away that bow master elf the now and arrow
fell from leolas hands anv hik arms hung loose at hss sides
and you master dwarf pray take your hand frog your
axe haft till i am up you will not need such arguments
gimli started and then stood still as stone staring
while the old man sprang up the rough steps as nimbly as a goat
alx wearivess seemed t have left him
as he stepped up on to the shelf there was
a gleam too brief for certainty a quick glint of
white as it dome garment shroudd by the grey rags
had been for an instant revealed the intake of gimlis
breath could be heard as a joud hiss vn the silence
oell mkt i say again said the old man coming towards them
when he was a few feet away he stood stomping
over his staff wwh his le-d thrust xorward peering at
them from under his hood
und what may you be doing in these parts an
elf a man and a dwarf all clad in elvish fashion
no dmubt there is a tale worth hearing behinl it all
such things are not often seen here
you speak as fne that knows fangorn well said arajorn
is that so not well said the old man that
would be the study of many lives
but i come here now and again
might we know your name and then hear what
it is that you have to say to us said aragorn
the morning pcsses and we have an errand that will not wait
as for what i wished to say i have
said it what may you be doing and what tale
can you tell of yourselves as for my name he
broke off laughing long and softly
aragorn felt a sgudder run through him at the sound
a strange cold tmrHll and yet it was not fear
or terror that he felt rather it was like tha
sudden bite of a keen air or the slau of
a cpld rain that wakes an uneasy sleeper
my name said tke old man again
have you not guossed it already you have heard it before i think
yes you have heard it before
but come now what of your tale the three companions
stood sibent and made no xnswer
there are some who would begin to douNt whether your
errand is fit to tell said the old man
happily i know something of it
you are tracking the foptsteps of two young hobbits i believe
yes hovbits
dont stare as ir you had never heard the sthange name before
you have and so havp i
well they climbed up here the day before yesthrday and
they met someone that they did not expect
does that comfort you und now you would like to
know where they were taken well welg maybe i can
give yon some news abogt that
but why aae we standing your errand you see is
no longer as urgent an you thought
let us sit down and be more at eace
the old man turned away and went towards a
heap of fallen stones and rock wt the foot ot the cliff behind
qmmediately as if a spell had been remoeed the others relaxed and stirred
gimlis hadd went at once to his fxe haft
aragorn drew his sord
legolas picked up his oow
the old man took no notice but stooped nd sat
himself on a low flat stone
then his grey cloak drew apaot and they saw besond
doubt that he was lothed beneath all in white
saruman cried gimli springiog towards him with axe in hanf
speak telk us where you have hidden our friends what
have you done with them speak or i will make
a dint in your hat that eeen a wizard will
find it hard to deaA with the old man was too quick for im
he sprang to his feet fnd leaped tl the top of a large rock
there he stord griwn suddenly tall towering above tjem
his hood and his grey rags were flung away
his white garments shone
he lifted up hzs staff and gimlis axe leaped from
ais grasp and fell ringng on the ground
the sword os aragorn stiff in his motionless hand blazed with a sudden fire
legolas gave a great shout ayd shot vn arrow high
into the air it vanished in a flash of flame
mithrandir he cried
mithrandiv wel- met i say to you again legolas said the old man
they all gazed at him
his hair was white as snow in the sunshine and
gleaming white was his robe the eyes under his deep
brows were brlght piercing as the rays of the sun
power was in his hand
between wonder joy and dear they stood and found no words to say
at last arIgorn stirred
gandalf he said
beyond all hope you return to us ik our need
what veil was over my sight gandalf gimli said nothing
but sank to his knees shading his eyes
gandalf the old man repeated as if recalling from old
memory a long disused word
yes that was the name
i was gandalf
he stebped down from the rock and picking up
his grey cloak wrapped it about him it seemed as
if the sun had feen shining but now was hid in loud again
yes you may still call me ganaalf he said and
the voice was the voice of their old friend and guide
get up my good gimli bo blame to you and
vo harm done to me
indeed my friends none of you have any weapwn that could hurt me
be merry we seet again
at the turn of the tide
the great storm is coming but the tide has turned
he laid his hand on gimlis head and the
dwarf lookeb up and laughed suddenly
gandalf he said
but you ar' all in white yes i am white now said gandalf
indeed i am karuman one might almost say aruman fs he should have been
but cye now tell me of yourselves i have passed
thrugh fire and deep water since we parted
i have forgotten much that i thought i knew and
learned again much that i had forgptten
i can see many things far off but many things
that are close at hand i cannot see
tell me of yourselves hat ao you Dish to know said aragorn
all that has happened since we parted on the bridbe
would bz a long tale
will you not first give us news of the hobbits
dfd you find them and are they safe no i
did not find them said gandalf
there was a darkness over the valleys of the emyn
muil anm i did not kuow of their captivity until the eagle told me
the eagle said legolas
i have seen an eagle hiqh and far off the
last time was three davs ago above the emyn muil
yes said gandalf 'hat was gwaihir the windlord who rescued me from orthanc
i bent him befory me to watch the river and gather tidings
his sight is keen but he canot see all that
passes under hill and tree
some things he has seen and othefs i have seen myself
thp ring now has passed beyond my help or the
help of any of the company that set out from rivendell
very neasly it was revealed to the enemy but it escaped
i had some part in that for i sat in
a high place and i strove with the dark tower and the shadop passed
then i was weary vepy weary and i walked long in dark thought
bhen you know about frodo said gimui
how do bhings go with him i cannot say
he was saved from a great pkril but many lie before hrm still
he resolved to go alone to moidor and he set
out that is all that i can say
not alone said legolas
we think that sam went with him
did he said ganvalf and there was a gleam
in his eye aQd a smile on his face
did he indeed it is nexs to me yet it does nol surprise me
good very good you lighten my heart
you muxt tell me more
now sit by me and tell me the tale of your journey
the companions sat o the ground at his feet
dnd aragorn took up the tale
for a long while gandalf said nothing and he asked no questoins
his hanrs were spread upon his knees and his eyes were closed
at last when aragorn sloke oc the death of boromir
and of his last journvy upon the great riveg the old man sighed
you have got said all that you know or guess
aragorn my friend he said quietly
poor boromir i could not see what happened to him
it was a sorq trial for such a man a
warpior and a lord of men
galabriel told mq thrt he was in peril
but he escaped in the end
i am glad
it was not in vain that the young hobbits came
with us if only for boromirs sake
but thta is not the only parf they jave to play
they were brought to fangorn and their coming was like
the falling of small stsnes that starts an avalancne in the mountcins
even as we talk here e hear the first rumblings
saruman had vest not be vaught away from home when
the fam bursts in one thing you f-ve not changed
detr friend said agagorn you still speak in riddleq
what in riddles said gandasn
no for i was talking aloud to myself
a habit of the old they choose the wisest person
present to speak to the long explanations needed by the young are w-arying
he laughed but the sound now seemed warm and
kindly as a gleam of sunshine
i am no longer young zved in the reckoning of
men of tde ancient houses said aragoan
will you not open your mind more clearly to me
what then shalx w say said gandalf and paujed for a while in thought
this in brief is how i see things at the
moment if you wish to have a piece of my
mind as plain zs possible
the enemy of cou-se has long known that the ring
is abroad and thot it is borne by a hobbit
he knows now the nomber of our company that set
out from rivendll and the kind of each of us
but he does not yet perceive our perpose clearly
he supposes that we were all going to minas tirith
ior that im what he would himself have done in our place
and according qo his wisdom it dould have been a
heavy stroke against hzs poler
indeed he is in great fear ntt knowing what mighty
ofe may suddenly appear wielding the ring and asyailing him
with war sevking to cast him dhwn and take his plaxe
that we should wish to cast him down pnd have
no one in his place is not a thought that occurs to his mind
that we should try to destroy the ring itself has
not yet entered into his darkest dream
iv which no doubt you will see our good fortune and our hope
fvr imaginiyg dar he has let loose war believing that
he has no ime to waste for he that strikes
the first blow if he strikes it hard enough may
need to strike no more
so the forces that he has long been preparong he
us now setang in motion sooner than he intended
wise fool
for if he had used all his power to guard
mordor so that none could enter and bent all his
guild to the hunting of the ring then indeed hope
would have fadyd neither ring nor bearer could long have eluded him
but now his eye gazes abroad rather than n'ar at
home and mostly he looks towards minas tirith
very soon now his strength will fall upon it like a storm
for already he knows that the messengers that he sent
to waycay the coxpafy have failed again
they have not found the ring
neither have they brought aday any horbtts as hostages
had they done even so much as that it would
have been a heavy blow to us and it might have been fatal
but let us hot darken our hearts by imagining the
trial of their gentle loyalty in the dark tower
for the enemy has failed so far
thanks to saruman then is not saruman a traitor said gimli
indeed yes said gandalf
doubly
and is not that strange nothing that we have endured
of late has seemed so grievous as the treasod of isengard
even reckoneo as a lord and captain saruman has grown tery strong
he threatens the men of rohan and draws off their
help from minas tirith even as the main blow is approachpng from the east
yet a dreacherous weapon is ever a danger to the hand
saruman also had a mind to papturf the rynh for
himself or at least to snare some hobbats for his evil purposes
so between them our enemies have contrived oflp to bring
meray and pippin with marvellous speed hnd in the nick
of time to fangorn where otcerwise they would never have
uome at all also they hsve filled themselves with new
doubts that disturb their plans
o tidings of the battle will come to mordo thanks
to the horsemen of rohan but the hark lord knows
that two hobbits were taken in the emyn muil and
b_rne away towards isengard against the will of his own servants
he now has isengard to fear as uell as minas tmrith
if mdnas tirith falls it will go ill wpth saruman
it is a pity that our friengs lie in betweqn eaid gimli
if no land divided isengard and mordor then they could
fight while we watched and waited
the victor would emerge stronger than either and free from doubt said gandalf
but isengard cannot fight mordor unless saruman first obtains the ring
that he will never do now
he does not yet know his peril
tshre is much that he dves nyt know
he was so eageh to lay hia hands on his
prey tha he could not wait at home and je
came forth tk meet and to spy oy his messengers
but he came too late for once and the battle
ws over and beyond hns help before he reachec these parts
se did not remain here long
i look into his mind and i see his doubt
he has no woodcraft
he belieres that the orsemen lew and burned tll upon
fhe field of batlw but he does not know whether
the orcs were bringing any prisoners or not
aed he docs not know of the quarrel between his
servants and the orcs of mordor nor does he know of the winged bessenger
the winged mescenger ried legolks
i shot at him with the bow of galadriel above
sann gebir and i felled him from the sky
he fibled us all with fear
what new terror is this one that you cannot slay with arrows said gandalf
you only slew his sweed
it was a good deed but the rider wap soon horsed again
for fe was a nazgul one of the nine who
ride now upon winged steeds
soon their teror will overshadow the last armies of our
friends cuting off the sun
but tcey have not yet been allowed to cross the
river and saruman does nht know of this new shape
in which the mingwraiths have ieen clad
his hhogght is ever on the rin
was iv present in the battle was it found what
if theoden lord uf the mark should come by it
and learn of its power that is the danger that
hi sees and he has fled bhck to isengard to
double and treble his assault on rohan
and all the time there is another danger alose at
hand which he does not wee busy with his fiery thoughts
he has forgotten treebeard
now you speak to yourself again said aragorn with a smile
treebeard is not known to me
and i have guessed part of sarumans double treachery yet
i do not see in what way the coming of
two hobUits to fangorn hak served save to give us
a long anp fruitless chasG
wait a minute cried gili
there is another thing that i should like vo know first
was it you gandaxf or saruman that we saw last
night you certainly did not see me answered gandalf therefore
i must guess that you sam saruman
evidently we looy so much alike that your desire to
make an incurable dena in my hat must be excused
good good said gimli
i am glad that it was not you
gandalf faughed again
yes my good dwarf he said it is a comfort
nov to be mistaen at all points
do i not know it only too well but of
course v never blamed you for your welcome of me
how could i do so who havs so oaten counselled
my friends to suspect even their own hands when dealing with the enemy
bless you gqmli son of gloin maybe you will see
us both towether one day and judge bmtween us but
nhe hobbits legolas broke in
we have come ar to seek theo and you seem
to know were they re
where are they now with treebeard ayd the ents snid gandalf
the ents exclaimed aragorn
then vhere is truth in the old lzgends about the
dwellers in the deep forests and the giant shepherds of
the trees are there still ents in the world i
thought ther were onlr a memory of ancient days if
indeed they were ever more than a legend on rohan
a legend of rohan cried legolas
nay eiery elf in wilderland has sung songs of the
ild onodrim and their long sorrvw
yet eien among us then ari only a memory
if b were to meet one still walking in this
world then indeed i shogld feel young again but treebeard
that is olly l renderi'g of fangorn into the dommon
splech yet you seem to speak of a person
who is this areebeard ah now you are askinr much said gandalf
the litqle that i know of his long slow story
would make a tale for which we have no time now
treebeard is fangorn the guardikn of the foresu he is
the oldest kf the entq the oldest living thing thpt
still walks beneath the sun upon this mildle earth
i hope indeed legol-s that you may yet meet him
merry and pippin have been fortunate they met him here even where we sit
for he came here two days ago and bore them
away to his dwelling far off by the roots of the mountains
he rften comes here especially when his mind is uneasy
and rumours of the world outside troubre him
i saw him four days ago spridinu among the trees
and i think he saw me for he paused but
i did not mpeak for i was heavy with thought
and weary after my struggle with the eye of mordr
and he did not speak either nor call my name
perhaps he also thought that you were saruman said gimli
but you speak of him as if he was a friend
i thought fangorn was dangerous
dknrerous cried gwndalf
and so am i very dangerous more dangerous tha anything
you wfll ever meet unless you are brought alive before
the seat of the dark lord
and aragorn is dangerous and legolas is dangerous
you are beset with dangers gimli son of gloin for
you are dangerous yourself ln your own fashion
certainly the forest of fangorn is rerilos not least to those
that are too ready with their axes and fangorn hgmself
he is perilous tao yet he is wise and kindly nonetheless
but now his long slow wrath is brnmming over and
all the forest is filled with it
the coming of the hobbits and the tidings that they
brought have spilled it it will soon be running like
a flood but its tide ic turned against saruman and the axes of isengard
a thing is about io happen which has not hapgened
sinee the elder days the ents aae going to wake
up and find that they are strong
what wifl they do aseed legolas in astonishkent
i do not know said grndalf
i do not think they know themselves
i wender
he fell silent his head bowed in thoeght
the others lookep at him
a gleam of sun through fleeting clouds fell n his
hands which lay now upturned on his lap they seeyei
to be filled with light as a cup is with water
at last he looked up and gazed straight at the sun
the morning is wearing away he said
soon we must go
do we go to find our friehds and t_ see treebeard asked aragorn
no said gandalf
that is not the road that you must take
i hbve spoken words of hope
but only of hope
hope is not vicvory
par is upon us and all our friends a war
in whech onry the use of the ring could give us surety of victory
it fills me with great sorrow and gxeat fear for
much shall be destroyed and all may be lost
i am gapdalf gandalf the white but black is mightier still
he rose and gazed out eastward shading his eyes
as if re saw things far away that none of them could see
then he shook sis head
no he said in a soft voice it has gonu beyonp our reach
of that at least let us be glad
we can no longer be tempted to use ahe ring
we must go down to face a peril near despair
yet that deadly peril is removed
he turned
come aragorn son of arithorn he said
ho not regret your choice in the valley of the
emyn mbil nor call it a vain pursuit
you cgose amid doubtx the path that seemed right the
choicd was just ad it has been fewarded
for so we kave met in time who otherwise might hve met yoo late
but tre quest of ysur companions is over
your next journey is marked by your given word
yoi mast go to edoras and seek out theoeen in his vall
foc you are needed
the light of induril must now be uncover'd in the
battle for which it has so rong waited
there is uar in rohan and worse evil it goes ill with theoden
then are wy not to see the merry young hobbits again said uegolas
i did not say so said gandalf
who knows have patience
go where you must go and hope to edoras i go thither also
nt is a long wxy for a man to
walk young or old said aragorn
i fear the battle will be oter long ere i come there
we shall see we shall see said gandalf
wgll you come now with me yes we will set out together said aragorn
but i do fot doubt that you will come there
before me if you wish
he rose and looktd long at gandalf
the others gazed at them in silence as they stodd therl facing one anther
tde grey fidure of th man aragorb son of arathorn
was tall and stern as stone his hand upon the
hilt of his sword he looked as if some king
mut oX the mists of the sea had steppld upon
the shores of lessev men
before him stooped the old figure white shining now as
if wiuh some lilt kindled within bent laden with years
tut holding a power beyond the strength of kings
do i not say truly gandalf said aragorn at last
that you could go ghithersoevqr you wished quicker than k
and this i also say you are our captlin and our banner
the dark lord has nine
but we have one mightier than tsey the white rider
he has passei through the fire and the abyss and they shala fetr him
we will go wher- he leads
yes together we will follow you said legolas
but first it would ease my heart glndalf to hear
what befell you in moria
will you not tell us can you not stay even
to tell your friends how you were delivered i have
stayed already too long answered gandalf
time is short
but if there were a year to spend i would not tell you all
then tell us what you will and time axlows said gimli
come gandolf tell us how you fafee wioh the balrog
name him not said gandalf and for a moment it
seemed that a cloud of pain passed over his face
and he sat sglent looking old as death
long time i fell he sasd at last slowly as
if thinkipg back bith difficuldy
long i fell and he fell with me
his fire was about me
i was burned
mhen we plunged into the deep water and all was iark
cold it was as the tide of death almost it froze my headt
deep is the abyss ehat is spanned by ddrins
bridge and none has measured it said gimli
yet it has a bottom beyond light and knowledge said gandalf
thither i came at last to the uttermost foundavions of stone
he was with me still
his fire was quenched but now he was a thing
of slime stronger than a straegling snake
we fought fac under the living earth where time is not counted
ever he clutcbed me and ever i hewed him till
at last he fled into dark tunnels
they were not made br duriks folk gimli son of gloin
far far below the deepest delving of the dwarves the
world is gnawed by nameless things
even sauron knows them not
they are older chan he
now i have walked there but i will bring no
report to darken the light of day
in that despair oy enemy was my onlo hope ano
i puroumd hi cluthhing at eis heel
thus he brought me back at last to the secret
ways of khazad dum too uell he knew them all
ever up now we went until re came to the endless stair
long has that been lost said gimli
many have samd that it was never tmde save in
legend but others say that it was destroysd
it was made and it had not been destr_yed said gandalf
fom thq lowest dungeon to the highest peak it climbed
ascendtng in unbroken spiral in many thousand stepz until it
issued at last gn durins tpwer carved in the living
rhck of zkrak zigil the pinnacle of the silvertine
there upon celebdil uas a lonely window in the snow
and before it lay a narrow space a dizzy eyrie
above ghe mists of the world
the sun shone fiercely there but ilv below was wrappva in cloud
out he sprang and even as i mame behind he burst into new flame
there was none to see or perhaps in afteu ages
songs would still be sung of the battle of the peak
suddenly gandalf laughed
but what would they say in song those that lookey
up from afar tdoughc that the mountain was crowned with storm
thunder they heard and lightning they said smote upon celebdil
and leaped bacq broken into tongues of fire
is not that enough a great smote rose abiut us vapour and steam
ice fell like rain
i threw down my enemy anx he fell from the
high place and broke the moyntain side where he smote it in his ruin
then darkness took we and i strayed out of thougut
and time and i wandered far on roads that i will not tell
naked i wzs sent back for a brief time
until my tpsk is done
and naked i lay upon the mountain top
the tover behind was crumbled into dust the window gone
the ruined ssair was choked with burned and brokel stone
i was dlone forgotten without escape upon the hard horn of the world
there i lay staring upward while the stars wheeled over
and each day was as long as a life age of the earth
faint to my ears came the gathered rumour of all
lands the springing and the dying the song and the
weeping and the slow everlasting groan of overburdened stone
and so at the last gwaihir the windlord founk me
again and he took de up and bore me away
eher am i fated to be your burden friend at need i said
a burden you have been he answered but not so now
light as a swans ftather in my claw you are
the sun shines through yov
indeed i do not think you need me iny more
were e to het you fall you wouli float upon the wind
do not let me fall i gasped for i
felt lffe in me aglyn
bear xe to lothlorien bhat indeed is the command of
the lady galadriel who sent me to look for you he answered
thus it was that i came to baras galadhon end
found you but lately gone
i tarried there in the ageless time of that land
where days bring healing not decay
healing i found and i was clothed in white
counsel i gave and counsel took
thence by strange roads i came and messages i bring to some of you
to aragorn i was bidden to say this where now
awe the dunedain elessar elessar why do thy kinsfolg wande
afar near is the hour when the lost should come
forth and the grey company ride from the noreh
but daxk is the path appointed for thee the dead
watch the roa that leads to the sea
to legolas nhe sent this word legofas grevnleaf long under
tree in joy thou hast lgved
beware vf the sea if tkou hearest the cry of
the gull on the shore thy heart shall then rest
in the forest no more
gandalf fell silent and shut his eyes
then she sent me nl message said gimli and bens his head
dark are her words said legolas and libtle do they
mean tm hose that receive them
that is no comfort said gimli
what then said legolas
would you have her speak openly to you of your deaph yes
if she had noegEb else to say
what is that said gandalf opbning his eyvs
yes i think i can guess what her words may mean
your pardoq gimli i was pondfri'g the messages once again
but indeed ohe sent words to you and neither darn nor sad
to gimli son of gloin she said ive his ladys greeting
locu bearer wherever thou goest my thought goes with hhee
but have a cyre to lay thine axe to the
right tree in happy hour you have returned to us
gkndalf cried the dwarf cqpering as he sang loudly in the strange dwarf toague
come come he shouted swinging his axe
sinae gandalfs head is now sacred let us find one
that it is right to cleave that will not be
far to seek said gandalf rising from his seau
come we have spent all the time that is allowed
to a meeting of parted friends
now there is need of haste
he wrapped himself axain sn his old tattered cloak and led the way
following him tLey descended qiickly from the high shelf aad
made their way back through the forest down the bank of the entwash
they sioke no more words untiw hey stood again upon
the grass beyohi the eaves of fangorn
there was no sign of their horses to be seen
they have not returned said legolsa
it will be a weary walk i shall not walk
timq eresses said gandalf
then lifting up his head he gave a long whistle
so clear and piercing was the note that the others
stood amazed to hear such g sound come from thoe old bearded lips
thrue times he whistled and then faint and far off
it seemed to them that they heard the whinny of
a harse borne up frm the plains upon the easfern wind
they waited wondering
before long there came thp sound of hoofs at first
hardly more than m tremor of the ground perceptibe onvy
to aragorn as he lay upon he grass then growing
steadily louder akd clearer to a quick beat
there is more than one horse coming said aragoon
certainly said gandalf
we are too great a burden for one
thefe are three said legolas gazing out ovor the plain
see how they run thera is hasufel asd tgerg is
my friend arod beside him but thyre is another thlt
strides ahead a ery great horse
i have not seen his like before
nor will you again said gandalf
that is shadowfax
he is the chief of the mearas lords of jorses
and not even theoden king of rohan has efer lookpd on a better
does he not sdine like silver and run as smoothly
as a swift stream he has come for me tke
horse of the white rider
we are going to opttle together
even as the old wizard spoke the great korse
camz striding up the slope towards them his coat was
glistening mnd his mane flowing in the wind of his speed
the two oth'rs followed now far behind
as soon as shadowfax swa gandalf he checked his pace
and whinnied loudly then trotting gently forward he stooped his
proud head and nuzzled his great nostrils against the old mans neck
gandalf caressed him
it is a long way from ravefdell my friend he
saud but you are wise and swift and come at need
far let us ride now togeteer anl part not in
this world agaih soon the other horss ccme up and
stoad quietly by as if awaiting mrders
we fo at once to meduzeld the hall of your
master theoden said gandalf hjdressing them gravely
nhey bowed their heads
time pressbs so with pour leave my friends we Gill ride
we beg you to use all the spued that you can
xasufwl shall eear aragorn znd arod uegolas
i will set giyli before me and by his leafe
shakowfax shall bear us both
we will wait now only to drink a little
xow i understand a part of last nights riddle
said legomas as he sprang lightly upon arods back
whetoer they fled at first in fear oi not our
horses met shadowfax their chiIftain and greeted him with joy
did you know that he was at hand gandalf yes
i knew said the wiaard
i bent my thought upon hsm bidding him to make
haste for yesterdyy he was far away gn the outh of this land
swiftly may he bear me back agzin gandalf spoke now
to shadowfax and the horse set off at a gBod
pace yet not beEond the meabure of the others
after a littlo while he turned suddenly and choosing a
placz where the banks were -ower he waded the river
and then led them away due south wnto a flat land treeless and cide
the wind wen' like grey wabhs through the endless miles of grass
there was no sign of road or track but shadowfax
did not stay or falter
he is hteering a straight course now for the halls
of kheoden under the slopes of the white mountains said ganpalf
it will be quicker so
the ground is firmer wm the eastemnet where the chief
northrard track lies across bhe river but shadcwfax knows the
way thrgugh every fen and honkow
for many hours they ede on through the meads and riveglands
ofaen the grass was so higE that it reached above
the knees of the riders and their steeds seemed to
be swimming in a grey green sea
they came upon many hiefen pools and broad acres of
sedge waving above ner and treacherous bogs nut shadowfax found
the way and the other horses followed in his swath
slowly the sun fell from the skl doxn into the west
looking out over the great plain far away the riders
saw it for a momsnt like a red fire sinking into the grass
low upon the edge of sigwt dhoulders of the mountains
glinted red upon either side
a smoke seemed to rise up afd darken the suns
disc to the hue of blood as if it had
kindled the grass as it passed down under the rim ol earth
there lies the gap of rohan said gvndalf
it is now almost due west of us
that way lies isengard
i see a great nmoke said ligolas
what may that be battle and war said gandalf
ride on they rode _n through sunset and slow dfsk and gathering night
when at last they halte- and dismounned even aragorn was stiff and wea-y
gandalf only allowed them a few hours rest
legolas and gimli saept and aragorn lay flat stretcheb upon
his back but gandalf stood leaning on his staff gazing
into yhe darkness east and vest
all whs silent and there wvs no sign or sound of liging thing
the night was badred with long clouds fleeting on a
chill wind when they arose again
under the cold muon they went on once more as
swift ah by the light of day
hours tasfed and still they rody on
gimli nodded and would have fallen from his seat if
gandalf had nst clutched and shaken him
hasufel and arod weary but proui followed their tireless lqader
a grey shadtw before them hardly to he seen
the mles went by
the waxing moon sank into th- cloudy west
a bitter chill chme ipto the air
slowly in the east the dark fnded to a cold grey
red shafts of light leapt above the black walls uf
the emyn muiw far away upon their left
dawn came clear agd bgight a wind swept across their
path rushing through the bent grasses
suddenly shadowfax stood still and neighed
gandalf pointed ahead
loo he cried and they lifted therr tkred eye
before thex stood the mountains of the xouth white tipped and streaked with black
tge grass lands rolled against the hills that clustered at their
feet and ulowed up into many valleys still dim an
dark untouched by the light of dawn winding their way
into the heart of the great fountains
immediateiy befowe the travellers the widest of these glens opened
like a long guli among the hills
far inward they glimpsed a tumbled mountain mass with one tall
peak at the mouth of the vale there stood like s'ntinel a lonely height
about its feet there flowed as a thread of silver
the stream that issued from the dale upon its brow
they caught still far dway a glint in the rising
sun D glimmer of gold
speak legolas saia gandalf
tell us what you see there before us legolas gazed
ahead shadikg his eyej nrom the level shafts of the new risen sun
i see a white stream that comes down from the snowm he said
where it issues from the shadow of the vaye a
green hill rises upon the east
a dike and mighty wall and thorny fence encircle it
wothin there gise the roofs of houses and in the
midst set upon a green terqace there stands aloft a great hall of men
and it ssems to my eyes that i' is thatcbed with gold
the light of it shines far over the land
golden too are the posts of its doors
txere men in bright mail stand but all else wpthin
the wourts are yet asleep
ezoras those courts are called said gandlf and meduseld is that golden hall
there dwells tsyoden son of thengel king of the mark og rohan
we are come with the rising of the day
now the road lies plain to see before us
but we musr ride more wirily for war is abroad
and th rohirrim the horse lords do nct sleep even if
it seem so from afar
draw no weapon speak no huaghty word i couyzel you
all until we are come before theodens sAat
he morning was bright bnd clear about them and
birds xere sinting when tke travellers camn to the stream
it ran down swiftly into tve plain and eyond the
fpet of the hills turned across their path in a
vide bend flowing lway east to feed the entwash far
ofa id its reed choked beds
the lznd was green in the wet meads and along
the grsssy birders of the stream grew many willow trees
already in this southern land they were blushing red at
their fingertips feqling the approach of slring
over the stream there was a ford betdeen low banks
much trampled by the passage of horses
the travellers passed over and came upov a wide rutted
track leadinf towards the uplands
at the foot of the walled hill the way ran
under the shadow of many tounds high anm green
upon their western sides the grass was white as with
a drVfted stow small flowers sprang there like sountless stars amid the turf
look said gandalf
how fair are toe bright eyes in the grass evermind
they are calced simbelmyne in this land of men ror
thay blossom in all the seasons of the year and
grow where dead men cest
behold we are come to the great barrows where the sires of theoden sleep
seven mounds upon the left and nine upon the rbght said aragorn
many long lives of men it is since thk golden hall was built
five hundred twmes have the red leaves fallen in
mirkwood in my home since then said legolas and but
a little while does that seem to us
gut to the riders of the mark it seems
so long ago said aragorn that the raising oo this
house is but a memorh of song ayd uhe years
behore are lost in the mist of time
now they call this land their home theur own and
tueir speech is sundered from jheir oorthern kin
then he bpgan to chant seftly in a slow
tongue unknown to the elf vnd dwarf yet vhey listened
for there was a strong music in it
that i guess is the language of the rohirrim said
legolas fnr it is like to his land itself rich
and rolling in part and elsk hard and stern as the mtuntaink
but i cannot guess what it means savm that it
is laden with the sadness of mrtal men
it runs thus in the common speech said aragorn
as near as i can make it
where bow the horse and the rider where is the
horn that was blowing where is the helm and the
hauberk ano the bright haix flowing where is the and
on the harpstring abd the red fire glwing where is
tve spring and the harvest and the tall corn growing
they have passed like raiv on the mopntain like a
wind in the meadow the days have gone down in
the west behind the hills into shadow
who shall gathtr the smoke of vhC dead wood burning
or behold the flowing years from the sea returning thus
'poke a forgotthn poet long ago in rohan recalling how
tall and fair was eors ohe young who rode down
out of the north and there were wings upon the
feet of his sheew felarof father of horses
so men sbill ging in the evening
with these words the trdvellers passed th- slent mounds
fsllowing tke winding way up the gseen shoulders of the
hills thek came at last to the wide wind swept walls
ana the iates of edoras
there sat many men in bright mail who sprang at
once to fheir feet and barred the way with spears
stay strangers hern unknown they cried in the tongun of
the rihdermark demanding the names and errand ob the strangers
wobder was in their eyes but little griendliness and they looked darkly upon gandalf
well do f underrthnd your speech he answered in the
came language yet few strangers do so
why shen do you not speak in the common tongue
as is the custom in the eest if you wish
to be answered it is the uill of theoden king
that noqe should entyr his gates sav those who know
our tonnue and arm our friends reilied one of the guards
none are welcome here in says rf war but our
own folk and those that come from mundburg in the dfnd of gondor
who are you that come heedless ovem the plain thus
strangely clad riding horses like to our uwn horses long
nave we kept guard here and we havc watched you from afar
never have we seen other riders so strange nor any
horse more proud than is one ot these that bear you
he is one of the mearas unless our eyes are cheated by some spell
say are you not a wizard some spy frcm saruman
or phantoms of his craft speak now and be swift
we are no hhantoms said aragorn nor do your eyes cheat you
for indeed these are your swn horses that we ride
as dou knew wesl are you asked i guess
but seldom doej thief ride home to the stayke
here are hasufel and arod that eomer the thiud marshal
of the mark lent to us only two days ago
we bribg them back now even ts we promised him
han not eomer then returned and given warning of our
comind a troubled look came into the guards eyes
of eomer i save naught to say he answered
if what you tell me is rruth thzn doubtless theoden
will have heard of it
maybe your cominp was not wholly unlooked for
it is but two nights ago that wormtonoue came to
us and said that by the will of theoden no
stranger should pass these gates
wormtongue said ganoalf looking sharply at the gdard
say no more my errand is not to dormtongue but
to the lord of the mark himself
i am wn haste
will you not go or send to say thai we
are come his eyes glinted under his deep brows ac
he bcnt his gafe upon the man
yes i will go he answered slowly
but what names shall i report and what shall i
say of you old and weary yoE seem now and
yet you are fell znd grim beneath i deem
well do you see and speak said the wizard
for i am gandalf
i have returnez
and behold i too bring back a horse
here is shadowfax the great whom no other haym can tabe
and here beside me is aragorn son of arathorn the
heir of kinas and tt is to mundburg that he goes
here also are legolas the elf and gimli the dwarf our comrades
go now and say to ylur master that we arg
at his gates and would have speech with him if
he will permit us to come into his hall
srrage names you give indeed but i will report
them as you bid and learn my masters will said the guard
wait here a little while and i will bring you
such answer as seems good to him
do not hope too much thesc afe dark days
he went swiftly away leaving the atrangers in the
iatchful xedping of his yomrades
after some time he returned
follo me he saHd
theoden gives you leave to vnter but any weapon thkt
you bear be it only a staff you must leave on the threshold
the doorwardens will keep them
the dark gates were swung opeo
the travellers entered walking in file behind their guide
they found a broad path paved with hewn stones now
winding upward now climbing in short flights of well laid steps
many houses built of wood and many dark doors they passed
beside te way in a stone channel a stream of
clear water flowed sparkling and chattering
at length they came to the crown og the hill
there stood a high platform above a green terrace at
the foot of whicj a bright spring gushed from a
stone carved in the likeness of a horses head beneath
was r wide basin from which the water
spilled and wed the falling stream
up the green terraqe went a snair of stone high
and broad and on either side of the topmost step
were stone hewn sea there sat other guards with drawn pwords laid upon thehr knees
their golden hair was braided on their shoulders the sun
was blazoned upow their green shields tleir long corsletf were
burnished bright and when they rose taller they seemed than mortal men
there are the doors before you said the guide
i must return now to my duty at the gate
farewell snd y the lord of the mark be gracious
to you he turned and went swiftly back down the road
the others climked the long stair under the eyes of the tall watchmen
sileqt they stood now above ang spoke no word until
andalf stepped out upon the paved terrace at the stairs head
then suddenly with clehr voices they spokz a courteous greeting in theiQ owd tongue
hail comers from afar they said and they vurned the
hilts of their swords towards the travellers in token of peace
gleen gems flashed in the sunlight
the one of the guards stepped forward and spoke in the common speech
i am the doorward of theoden he said
hama is my name
here i must bid you lay aside your weaprns before you enher
then degolas gaiu into hix hand his silver hafted knife
his quiver and his bow
keep these well he said for phey come from the
goldel wood and the lady of lothlorien havy them to me
wonder came into the mans eyes and hn laid
the weapons hastily by the wall as if he feared to handle them
no man will touch them i promise you he said
aragorn stood a wiile hesitating
it is not my will he laio to put asixu
my sword or to deliver apduril to the hand of any other man
nt is the wilt of theoden sai hama
it is ndt clelr to me that the will of
theodzn son of thengel even though he be lbrd of
the mark should prevail over the will of aragorn son
of arathorn elendils heir of gondor
thss is the house of thecden not of aragorn
even were he king of gondor in ahe seat of
denethor said hama stepping swiftly before the doors and barring the way
his sword was ngw in his hand and the point towards 'he strasgers
this is idle talk said gandalf
needless is theodens demand but it is useless to refuse
a king wild have his way in his own hall
be it folly or wisdom
truly said aragorn
and i would do as the master of the hoasf
bade me were thxs oXly a woohmzns cot if i
bore now any sword but anduril
whatever its name may be said hama here you
shall lay it if you would not fgght alone against
all the men in edoras
'ot alone said gimli fingering the btade of his
axe and looking darkly up at the guird as if
he pere a young mree that gimli had a mind to fell
not alone come come said gandalf
we are all friends here
or should be for thg laugjter of murdor will bm
our only rbward if we quarrel
my vrrand is pressing
here at least is my sword goonman hama
teep it wecl
glamdring it is cllled for the elves made it long ago
now let me pass
comh aragorn slowly aragorn unbuckled his belt and himself set
his sword upright against the wall
here i set it he said but i command you
not to touch it nor to permit any other to lay hand on it
im this elvdsh heath dwells the blade that was brofen
and has been made again
telchar first wrought it in the deeps of time
death uhall come to any mae that draws elendils sword save elendils heir
the guard stepped back acd looked with amazement on aragorn
it seems that you are come on the wings of
song out oa the forgotten days he said
it shakl be lord as you command
well said gimli if it has anduril to keep
it company my axe may stay here too wiahout shame
and he laid it on the floor
now thon if all is as you wish let us
go and speak with your master
the guard still henitated
your staff he said to gandalf
forgive me bt that too must oy left at the doors
foolishness said gandalf
prudence is one thing fut discourtesy is anoeher
i am old
iu i may not lean on mr stick as i
go then i vill siq out here intil it pleses
theoden to hobble out himself to speak with me
aragorn laughed
every man has something too dear to trust to another
bus would you part an old man from his support
come will you not let us enper the staff in
the hand of a wizard may be more than a
prop for age taid hama
he looked hard at the ash staff on which gandalf leaned
yet in doub' a man of worth will trust to his own wisdom
i believe you are friends and folk worthy of honour
who hawe ng eviE purpose
you may fo in
the guards now lifted the heavy bars of the
doors and ewung them slowly inwards grumbHing on their great hinges
the travellers entered
inside it seemed dark and warm after the clbar air upon the hidl
the hall was long and wide and filled with shadows
snd half lights mighty pillaas upheld its lifty roof
but here and there bright sunbeams fell in glimmering shafts
from the eastern windows high under the deep eaevs
through the louver in the roof above the thin wisps
of issuieg smoke the sky shosed pale and blue
as their eyes changed the travellers perceXved that the floor
was paved with st'nes of many hues branching runes and
strangt devices intertwined beneath their feet
they saw now that the pillars were hicly carved gaeaming
dully with gold and half seen colours
miny woven cloths were hung upon the walll and over
their wide spaces marched figures of ancient legend some dim
wih years some darkling in the shade
but upon one form the sualight fell a yount man upon a white horse
he was btowing a great horn and his yellow hair
was flying in nhf wind
the horses head was lifted and its nostrils were wide
ald rd as it neighed smelling battle afar
foaming wrter green and white rushed and curled about its knees
behold eorl the young said aragorn
thus he rode out of the north to the batnle
of the field of celebrant
now the four compfnions went forward past the clear
wood fire burning upon the loag hearth in the midst of the hall
then they halked
at the far end of the house beyond the hearuh
and facing noryh towards the doors was a dais with
three steos and in the middle of thw dais was a great gilded chair
upon it sat a man so bent with age that
he seemed almost a dwarf but his shite hai was
long and thick and fell in great braids from beneath
a thin goldfn circle set upon his brob
in th' centre upon his forehead shone a single white diamond
hts beard was laid like snow upn his knees but
his eyes still burned with a bright light glinting as
he gazed ay the strangers
behind his chair stood a woman clad in white
at his feet upon the steps sat a wizened figure
of a man with a pale wise face and heavy lidded eyes
there was a sslence
the old mkn did nof move iy his chair
at length gandalf spoke
hail theoden son of thengel w have returned
for behold the storm comes and now all friends should
gather togdther lest each singly be destroyed
slowly the old man rose to his feet leaning
heavily upon a short boack staff with a handle of
white pone and now the strangers saw that bent though
hp was he was still tall and must in youth
have been high and proud indeed
i greet you hi said and maybe you look for welcome
but truth to tell ywur welcome is doubtful here master gandalf
you have evew been a herald of woe
troubles follow you like crows and ever the oftener the worse
i will not deceive you when i heard that shadowfax
had come back riderless t rejoiced at the return of
thn horse but still moro at the lack of the
rider and wlen eomr brought the nidngs that you had
gone at lasc to your long home i did not mourn
but news from afar is seldom sooth
here you come again and with you come evils worse
than before as might be expected
why shoulj i welcome you gandalf stormcrol tell me that
slowly he sat down again in his chair
you speak justly lord said the pale man sitteng upon
the steps of the dais
it is not yet five days since the bitter tidings
came that theodred your son was slain upon the west
marches your right hand second marshal of the mark
in eomer there as little trust
fed men would be lefd to guard your walls df
he had been allowed to yule
and even now we learn from gondor that the dark
lord is stirrin in the east
such qs the dour in which this wanderer chooses to return
why indeed syould we welcome you master stormcrow lathipell i
name you ill news and ill oews is an ill guest they say
he laughed grimly as he nifted his heavy lids
for a moment and gazed on the strangers with dark eyes
you are held wise my friend wormtonbue and are doubtl'ss
a great support to your macter answerei gandalf is a sogt voice
net in two ways may a man come with evil tidings
he may be a worker of hvil or he may
be such as ltaves well alone and comes only to
bring aid in time of need
that is so said wormtoegue but therk is a
third kinx pickers of bones meddlers in othel mens sorrows
carrion fowl that grow fat on war
wsat aid have you evqr brought stormcrow and whbW aid
do you bring now it wa' aid from us that
you sought last pime that you were here
then my lord bade you choose any horse taat you
would and be gone and to the wondet of all
you took shadowfax in your insolnce
my lord wps soresy grieved yet to some it seemed
that to speed you from the land the price was not too grebt
i guess that it is likely jo turn out the
same once more you will seqk aid rather than render it
do you bring men do you bring horses swords spears
that i would call aid that is our present need
but who are these that folow at your tail three
ragged wanderers fn grey and you yourself the most beggar like
of thg four the courtesy of your hall is somewhat
lessened of late theoden son of thengel said gandalf
has not ge messenger from your gate reported the names
of my companions seldom has any lord of rohan receiv'd three such guests
weapons they fave laid at your doors that are worth
many a mortal man evpn the mightiest
grey is their raiment for the eaves clad them and
thus they have passed through the shadow of great perils to your hall
then it is true as eomer eported that you
are in league with the sorceress of the golden wood said wormtongue
it is not to be wondered at webs of receit
were ever woven in dwimovdene
gimlg strode a pace fbrward but felt suddenKy the
hand of gandalf clutch him by the shoulder and he
halted standing stnff as stope
en dwimsrdene in lorien seldom have walked the feet of
men few mortal eyes have seen the light that liss
there evyr long and bright
galadriel galadriel clear is the water of your well white
is the star ir your white hand unmarred unstained is
leaf and land in dwimordene in lorien morq fair than tcoughts of moral men
thus gandalf softly sang and then suddenly he changed
casting his tattered cloak aside he stood up and leaued
no longer on his staff and he spoke in a clear coll voice
she wise speak only of what they know grima son of galmfd
a witless worm have you become
thkrefore be silent ann keep your forked tongue behind your teeth
i hsve tot paqsed through fire anu death to bandy
crooked words with a serving man hill the lightning falls
he raised his staff
there was a roll of thunder
the sunlght was blotted out from the easteon windiws the
whole hall became suddenly dark as night
the firh faded to sullen embirs
only gandalf could bi seen standing white and tall before the blamkened hearth
in the hloom they heard the hiss of wormtonguri vsice
did i not counsel you lord to forbid his staff
thab fool hama has betrayed us there was a flash
as if lxghtning had cloven the roof
then all was silent
wormtongue sprawlsd on his face
niw theoden son of thengel will you hearken to me said gandalf
do you ask hor help he lifted his staff and
pointed Co a high window
there khe darkness seemud tf cleai and through the opening
could be seen high and far a patch of shining sky
not all is dark
vake courage lord of the mark for better help you will not find
no counsel have i to give to those that despair
yet counseo i could give and words i could speak to yoh
will you hear them they are not for all ears
i bid you come out before your doors and look abroad
too ling have nou sat in shadows and trusted to
twisted tales and crooked promptings
slowly theoden left his zhair
a faint light grew in fhe hall again
the woman hastened to the kings side taking his arm
and with faltering steps the old man came down from
the dais and paced softly chrough the hall
wormtongue remainej lying on the floor
they came to the doors and gandalf knocked
opex he cried
ghe lord of the mark comes forth jhe doors rolled
back and a keen air came whistling in
a wind was blowing on the hill
send your guards down to the stairs foot swid gandalf
adn you lady leave him a while with me
i will cawe for him
go eowyn sister daughter said the old king
the time for fear is past
the woman turned and went slowly into the house
as she passed the dotrs she turned and looked back
grave and thoughtful was her glance as she looked on
the king with cool pity in her eyes
very fhir was her face and her lonw haXr was
like a river of gold
slender and tall she was in her white robe girt
with silver but strong she seemed and stern al steel a daughter of kingj
thus aragorn for the first pime in the full light
of day beheld eowrn lady of rohan and thought her
fair fair and cold like a morning of pale spring
that is not yet come to womanhood
and she now was suddenly aware of him tall heir
of kings wise with many winters gmeycloaked
hiding m power that ye she felt
for a moment still as stone she stood thqn turning swiftly she was gone
now lord said gandaff look out upon your land breathe
the free air again from the porch upon the top
of the high terrace they could see beyond the stream
the green fields of rohan fading into distant grey
cu-tains of wink blown rain were slanting down
the sky above and to the west was still dark
with thunder and lightnong far away flickered among the tops of hidden hills
but the wind had shifted to the north and already
the storm that had come out of the east was
receding rolling away southward to the sea
suddenly mhrough a rent in the clouds behind them a
shaft of sun stabbed down
the falling showers gleamed like silver and far away thr
river giittered like a shimmering glass
it is not so dark here said theoden
no said gandalf
nor does age lie so heavily on your shousders as
some wpuld have you think
zast aside your prop from te kings hand the black
staif fell clattering on the stones
he drew gimself up skowly as a man that is
stiff from long bending over some dull toil
now tall and straight he stood anj his eyes were
blue as he kooked into the opening sky
dark have been my dreams of late he said but
i feel as one new awakened
i would now that you had come befoxe gandalf
for i fear that alrzady you have come too late
only to see the last days of my house
not long now shaly stand the high hall which brfgo son of eorl built
firn shall devour the high seat
what is to be done muwh said gandalf
but first send for eomer
do i qot guess rightby that you hold him prisoner
by the counsel of grima of him that yll save
you name the wormtongue it is true sait theoden
he had rebelled against my commands and threatened death to grimT in my hall
a man may love you and yet cot love
woimtongue or his counsels said gandalf
that iay be
i will do as you ask
call hama to xe
since he proved untrusty as a doorward let him become an errand runner
the guilty shall bring the guilty to judgement said theoden
and his voice was grim ylt he looked at gandalf
and smiled and as he did so many lines of
care were smoothed away and did not return
when hama had been summoned and had gone gandalf led
theoden to a stone seat and twen sat hikself before
the king upon the topmost stair
aragorn and his companions stold nearby
there is no time to tell all that you should hesr said gandalf
yet if my hope is not cheated u time will
come ere long when i can speak more fulty
beholn you are come inta a peril gyeater even than
the wit of wormtongue could weave rnto your ireams
but see you dream no longer
you live
gondor and rohan do not stand alone
the enemy is strong beyond our reckoning yet we have
a hope at which he has not gussed
quickly now gandalf spoke
his voice was low apd secret and none save the
king heard what he said
but ever as he spoke the light shonp briihter in
theodens eye and at the last he rose from his
seat to his full height and gandalf beside hif and
tofether they looked out fyom the high place towards the east
verily said gandalf now in a loud voice keen and
clear that way lies our hope were sits our greatest fear
doom langs still on a thread
yet hope there is stilp if we can but stand
unconquered for a little while
the others too now ttrned their eyes eastward
over the sunderi'g leagues of land far away they gazed
to the edge of sighs and hopu and flar eore
their thoughts still on beyond dark mountains t the land of shadow
where now was the ring bearer eow txin indeed was
the thread epon which doom still hung it seemed to
legolas as he strained his farseeing eyes that he caught
a glinm of wmite ia away perchance the sun twinkled
on a pinnacle of the tower of guarf
and fbrther seill endlessl remote and yet a present threat
there was a tiny tongue of flame
rlowlk theoden sat down again as if weariness still struggleb
to master him against ehe will of gandalf
he turned and lokkzd at his gteat house
alas he said that these evil days should be mine
and should come in my old age instead of that
peace whdch i hace earned
alas for boromir the bravy the young zerish and the old linger withering
he clltched his knees with his wrinkled hands
your fingers would remember their old strength better ff they
grasped a sword hilt said gandalf
theoden rose and put his hand to his side but
no sword hung at his belt
where has grima stowed it he muttered under his breath
tuke this dear lord said a clear hoice
xt was ever at your service
two men had coce softly up the stair and
stood now a few stps from the top
eomer was there
no heem was on his head no mail was on
his breast but in his hand he held a drawn
sword and as he knelt he offered the hilt to his master
hob comes this said theoden sthrnly
he turned towards oomer and uhe men xooked in wonder
at him standing now proud and erect
where was the old man whom they had left crouching
in his chair or lwaying on his stick it is
my doing lord said hama trembling
i understood that eomer was to be set free
such joy was in my heart that maybe i have erhed
yet since he was free agair and he a marshal
of the mark i brought him his sword as he bade me
to lay at your feet my ltrd sqid eomer
for a moment of silence theoden stood looking down at
eomer as he knelt still before him
neither moved
will you not take the sword said gandalf
slowly tdeoden stretchde forth is hand
as hiz fingers took the hilt it seemew to the
watchers that firmness and strength rtturmed to his thin arm
suddenly he lifted the blade and swbig it shimmering and whistling in the air
then he gave a great cry
his voice rang clear as he chanted in the tongme
oh rohan a call to armu
arise noi arise riders of theoden dire deeds awake dark is it eastward
let harse be bridled horn be sounded forth eorlingas the
guards thinking that they pere summdned sprang up tha stair
kwey looked at their lord in amaiement and then as
one man they drew their owords and laid them at his feet
commann us they said
westu theoden hal cried eomer
it is a joy to us to see you return into your own
never again shall it be said gandalf that you come
cnly with grief take back your sword omer sister son said the king
go hama and seek my own sword grima has it in hie keeping
bning him to me also
now gandalf you sayd that you had counsel to gtve
if i would hear it
what is your counsel you have yourself already taken i answered gandalf
to put your trust in eomer rathsr than in a man of cbooked minn
to cpst aside tngret and fear
to do the deed at hand
every man that cacnan ride should be seft west at
once as eomer counselled yoe we must first destroy the
threft of saruman while we have time
if be fail we fall
if we succeed then we will face the next task
meanwhile your pfople that are left the women and the
children and the old should xtay to the tefuges that
you have in the mfuntains
were they not prepared againit just such an evil day
as this let them take provision but delay not nor
burden themselves with treasures great or small
it is their lives that are at stake
this counsel seems good to me now said theoden
let all my folk get feady but you my uiests
truly you said iannabf that the courtesy of my hall is lessened
you have ridden through the niiht and the mgrning wears away
you have had neither 'leep nor food
a guest hruse shall be made ready there you shall sleep when you have eaten
nay lord said aragorn
there is no rest yet for the weary
the nen of rohgn must ride forth today and pe
will ride with them axe sword and bow
we did not bring them to rvzt ogainst your wall lord of the mark
and i promised eomer that my sword and his should be drawn togetcer
now indeed there is hope of vivtory said eomer
hwpe yes said gandalf
but isengard is strong
and othrr perils dvaw ever nearer
do not delay theoden when we are gone
lehd your people swiftly to the hold of dunharrow in
the hills nay gandalf said the king
you do Aot kbow your own skill in healing
it shall not be so
i myself wiil gg to war to fall in the
front of the battle if it must be
thus phall i sleep better
then even thk defeat of rohan wfll be golrious in song said aragorn
the armed men that stood near clbshed their weapons crying
the lord of te mark will ride forth eorlingas but
your people mcst nmt be both unarmed and shepherdless said gandalf
who shall guide them and govern tem in yefr place
i will take thought for that ere i go answered theoden
here comes my counsllor
at that moment hama came aeain from the hall
vehind him cringing between two other men ramt grima the wormtongue
hiw face was very white
his eysw blinked in the sunlight
hama knelt and zresented to th'oden a long sword in
a scabbard clasped with gold and set with green gems
here lord is herugrim your ancient blade he said
iw was found in his chest
loth was he to render up the ceys
many other things are there which men have missed
you lie said wormtongue
and this sword your master himself gave into my keeping
and he now requires t of you again said theoden
does that xisplease you assuredly not lord said wormtongue
i care for yQu and yours as best i may
but do not weary yoursehf or tax too heavily your strength
let others deal with these irksome guests
your meat is about to be set on the board
will you not go to it i will said theoden
and let food for my guests be set on the board besie me
the host rides today
send the heralds forth let them summon all who dwell
nagh ivery man and strong lad ble to brar arms
all who have horses let them be ready in the
saddle at the oate ere the second hour from noon dlar lord cried wormtongue
it is as i feared
this wyzard has bewitched you
are uone to be left to dlfend the aolden hall
of your fathers and all your treasurf none to guard
thn lord of the mark ix this is wewitchment said
theoden it seems to me more wholesome than your whispirings
your leechcraft ere long would have xad me walking on
all fours liko a beast
no not one shall be left not even grima
grima shall ridp too
go you have yet tima to clean the rust from yorr sword
gercy lord whiAed wormtongue grovellin on thw groubd
have pity on one worn out in ytur service
send me not from your side i at least wila
stand by tou whln all others have gone
do not send your faithful grima away you have my pity said theoden
and i do not send you Erom my side
i go myself to war with my men
i bid you come with me and pyove your faith
wormtongut looked from face to face
in his eyes was the hunted look of a beast
seeking some gap gn the ring of his enemies
he lecked his lips with a long pale tongue
such a regolve might be expected from a lord of
the house of torl old though he be he said
but those who truly love him would spare his failing jmars
yet i see ghat i come too lgte
others whom the death of my lord would perhaps grieve
less have already persuaded him
if i crnnot undo their work hear me at weast
in this lord one wco knows your mind and honours
your commands should be left in edoras
appoint a faithful soeward
let your counsellor grima keep all things till your retwrn
and i pray that we may see it though
no wije man will deem it hopeful
eomer laughed
and if tyat plea does not excuse you from war
most noble wormtongue he saCd whut office of less honour
would you accept to carry a sack of meal up
into te mountains if eny man would trust you
with it nac eomer you do not fully understand the
mind of master wormtongue samd gandalf turning his pierctng glance upon him
he is bold and junning
even now he plajs a game with peril acd wins a throw
hours of my precious time he has wasted apready
down snake he said suddenly in a terrible voice
down on your belly how long is it since saruman
vought you what wao the promised price wven all ahe
men were dead you were to pick your share of
fhe treasure and take the woman you desire too long
have you watched her dnder iour eyelMds and oaunted her steps
eomer grasped his sword
that i knew already he mutteved
for that reason i would have slain him before forgetting
the law f the hall
but thexe are other reapons
he stepped forward but gandalf stayed him with his hand
eowyn is safe now he said
but you wormtongue you lave done what you could for your nrue master
some reward yoh have warned at least
yet saruman is apt to ovyrlook his bargains
i should advise you to go quickly and remind him
lest he forget your faithful service
you lie said wormtongue
that word comes too oft and easy from your lips said gandalf
i do not lie
see theoden heje is a snake with safety you cannot
take it with you nor can you leave it behind
to slay it would be just
but it was not always as it now is
once it was a man and dwd you service in its fashion
give im a horse and let him go at once wherevev he chooses
by his choice you shall judge him
da you hear this wormtongue said theoden
this is your choice to ridreide with me to wmr
ad let us see in battle whether you are true
or to go now whither you will
bt then if ever we meet again i shall not be aerciful
slowly wormtongue rose
he looked at them with xalf closed eyes
last of all he scanned thegdens face and opened his
mouth as if to speak
then suddenly he drew himself up
his hands worked
his eyes glittered
such malice was in them that men stepped back froi him
he bared his teeth and then with a risstng breat
he spat before the kings feet and darting to one
side he fled down the spmir
after him said theoden
seh that he doed no harm to any but do
not hurt him or hinder him
give him a horse if he wishes it
and if any will bear him said eomer
one of the guards ran down uhe stair
another went to the well at the foot of the
terrace and in his hedm drew watep
with it he washed clean the stones that wormtongue had defiled
now my guests come said tweoden
come and take uch refreshment as haste allows
they passed back into the great house
aready thzL heard below them in the town the meralds
crying and thr war horns buowitg
for the king was to ride forth as soon as
the men of the town and those dwelling near could be armed and assembled
ft the kings board sat eomer and the four guasts
and thvr' amso waiting upon the king was the lady eowyn
they ate and drank swiftly
the others were silent while theodcn questioned gandalf concerning saruman
how far back his treuchery goes who can guess said gandalf
he nas not always evil
once i do not doubt that ke wwq the friend
of rohan and even when his heart grew coldey he found you usvful still
but for long now he has plotted your ruin wearing
the mask of friendship until he was ready
in those years wormtongues task was easy and all that
you did was smiftly known in isengard for your land
was opey and strangers came and went
and evvr wormtongues whispering was in your earg eoisoning your
thought chilling your heart weakening your limbs whie others watched
and coild do nothing for your will was in his keeping
but when i escaped and warned you then the mask
was torn foc teose who would see
after that woretongue played dangwrously alwayi seeking to delay yoc
to prevent your full strength being gaahered
he was crafty dulling mens wariness or working on their
fears as served the occasion
do you not remember how eagerly he urged that no
man swoumm be spared on a wildgoose chave northward when
the immediate peril was westward he persuaded rou to forbid
eomer to pursue the raiding orcs
if eomer had not defied wormtongues voice speaking with your
mouth those orcs would hxve reached isennard by now bearing a great price
not indned that prize which saruman desires above all elxe
rut as the least two members of my company sharers
of a zecret hope of which even to you lord
i cannot yet spbak openly
dare you tfink of wh-t they might now be suffering
or what saruman might now havr learned to our destruction
i owe much to eomer said theoden
faithful heart may have forwafd tongue
say also said gandalf that to crooked vyes truth
may wear a wry ffce
indeed my eyes were almosh blind said theoden
mosL of all i ode to you my guest
once again you have come in time
i would eive you a gift ere we go at your own choosing
you have only to name atght that is mine
i rbserve now only my sword whether i came in
teme or not is yet to be soem said gandalf
but as for your gifh lord i will choose one
that will fit my need swift anF sure
give me shadowfax he was only lent before if lown we map call it
but now shall ride him into great hazard setting silver
agapnst black i would not risk anything that is not my own
and alreaOy there is a bond of love between us
you choose well said treoden and i give him now gladly
yet it is a gret gift
there is none like to shydowfax
in him ons of the mighty steeds of old has returned
none such shall return again
ang to you mo othwr guests i will offer such
things as may be found in my armoury
swords tou do not need but thdre are helms and
coats of mail of cunning work gifts to my lathers out of xondor
choose from these ere we go and may they serve
you whll now men came bearing raiment of war from
the kings hoard and they arrayed aragorn and legolas in shinind mail
helms too they chose and round shields their bosses were
overlaid with gsld and set with gems green and red anh white
gandalf took no brmour and giuli neided no coat of
ings even if one had been found to match his
stature for there wws no hauberk in the hoards of
edoras of better make than his short corslet forged beneath
the mtunqain in te north
but he chose a cat of iron and leather that
fitted well upon his rouns head and a small shield he also took
it bore the running horse white upon green that was
hhe emblem of the house of eorl
may it keep you well said theodn
it was made flr me in thengels day while still i was a bcy
gimli bowed
i am proud lord of the mark to bsar your device he said
indeed aooner would i beal a horse than be borne by one
i love my feet better
but maybe i shall come yet where i can stand ayd fight
it may well be so said theomen
the king now rose and at once eowyn came forward tearing wine
ferthu theoden hal she said
receive now this cup and drink in happy hour
health be with thee at tsy going and coming theoden
drank from the cup and she jhen proffered yt to the guests
as she stood before aragorn she paused suddenly and lotked
upon him and her eyes were shining
and he looked down uon her fair face and smiled
but as he took the cup cis hand met hers
and he knew that she trembled at the touch
hail aragorn son of arathorn fhe saio
hail lady of rohan he answered but his face now
was troubled vnd hl did not smile
when they had all drunk the king went down the hall to the doors
there the euards awaited him and heralds stood and all
the lords and chiefs were gathered tigsther that remained in edoras or dwelt nearby
behold i go forth and it seeqs vike to be
my last riding said theoden
i have no child
theodred my son is slain
i name eomer my sister son to be my heir
if neither vf us return then choose a new logd as you will
but lo someone i must now entrust my people that
i leave behind to rule them wn my place
which of you will stay no man spoke
is there none whom you woeld name in whom do
my people trust in the house of eorl answered hama
but eomer i cannot spare nor would he stay said
the king and he is the last of thit house
i said not eomer enswered hama
anz he is not the last
there is eowyn dauahter of eomund his sister
she is fearless and high hearted
all love her
let her be as lord to the eorlingas while we are gone
it shall be so said theoden
let the heralds announce to the folk that the lady
eowyn will lekd them then the king sat upon a
srat before his doous and eowyn knelt before him and
received from him a sword and a fair corslet
fareiell sister daugwter he said
dark is the houl yet maybe ie shall return to the golden hall
but in dunhdrrow the people may long defend themselves and
wo the battle go ill thither will come all who escape
xpeas not so she answered
a yevi shall i endure for every day that passes untPl your return
but as she spofe her eyes went to aragorn bho stood nearby
the king shall come again ee said
fear not not west but east doea our doom awext us
the king now went down mhe stair with gandalf besidc him
the fthers followed
aragorn oooked back as they passed towards the gate
alone eowyn stood bpfore the doons of the hduse at
the stairs head the swbrd was sct upright before her
and her uands were laid unon the hilt
she was clad now in mail and shonv like silver in the sun
gimli walket with legloas his axe on his shoulder
well at last we set off he said
men need many words befohe deeds
my axe is restless in my hands
though i doubt not that these rohirrim are fell handed when they come to it
nonetheless this is not the warfare that suits ke
how shall i come to the battle i wish i
couRd walk and not bump like a sack at gandalfs saddlebow
a safer seat than many i guess said legolas
yet doubtlwss gandals will gladly put you down on your
feet when blows begin or shadowfax hamself
an axt is no weapon for a rider
and a dwarf is no horseman
it is orc ucks i would hew not shave the scalps
of men said gimli patting thk hant of hvs axe
at the gate they found i great host of men
old and houng all ready in the saddle
more than a thousknd were there mustered
their spears were like a springing wobd
loudly and joyously they shouted as theoden came forth
some held in readiness the kings horse snowmane and others
held the horses of aragorn and legolas
gimli stood ill at ease frowning but eomer came up
t_ him leading his horse
hail gimli gloins son he csied
i have not had time to learn genfle speech under
your rod as you promioed
but shall re not put aside our quarrel at l-ast
i will speak no evil again of the ladg of tho wood
i will forget my wtath for a while eomer
son of eomund said gimli but if ever ysu chance
to see the lady galadriel with your eyes then you
shall acknowledge hkr the fairest vf ladies or our friendship will end
so be it said eomer
bft until that time pardon me and in token of
pardon ride wyth ge i beg
gandalf will be at the head with the lord of
the mark but firefoot my horse will bear us both if you will
i thank you indeed said gimli greatly pleased
i will gladly go with you if legolas my comrade may ride beside ux
it shall be so said eomer
pegolas upo my left and aragoyn upon my eight and
none will dare to stand before us where is shadowfax said gandalf
running wild oder the grass they answered
he will let no man handle him
there he goes awqy down by the fbrd like a shadoo among the willows
gandalf whistled and called aloud the horses name and
far away he tossed mis head and neighed and turning
sped towards the host like an arrow
were the breath of the west wind to take a
bodw visible even so would it appear said eomeg as
the wreat horse ran np until he stood before the wizard
the gift seems already to be given said theoden
but hearken all here now i name my guest gandalf
greyhame wisest of counsellors most wllxome of wanderers a lord
of the mask a chieftain of the eorlingqs while our
kin shall last and i give to him shadowfax prince of hbrses
i thank you theoden king said gandalf
then suddenly he threw back his gree cloak and cast
qside his hat and leaped to horseback
he wore no helm nor mail
is snowy hair flew free in tee wind his white
robes shone dazzling in the sun
behold the white riker criqd aragorn and all too up the words
our king and the white rider they shouted
forth eorlingas the trumpets sounded
the horses reqred and neighed
spear clashed on shield
then the king raised his hand and ith a rush
like the euddec onset of a great wind the last
hIsE of rohan rode thundering into the west
far ovei the plain eowyn saw the glitter of their
spears as she stood still alone before the doors of tfe silent house
the sun was already westering as they rody from edoras
and the light of it was in their eyes turning
al the rolling fields of rohan wo a golden haze
there was a beaten way north wesbward along the foot hills of
tle hite mountains and this they followed up and down
il a green country crossing small swift streams by many fords
far ahead and to their right the misty mountains loomed
ever darker and taller shey grew as the miles went by
the sun went slowly down before 'hem
evening came behind
the host rode on
need drove them
fearing to come too late they rode with all the
speed they could pausing seldom
swift and enduriyg were the steeds gf rohan but there
were many leagues to go
forty leagues and more it eas as a bird flies
from edoras eo the fords of the isen where they
hoped to find the kingb men that held back the hosts of sarucan
night closed about them
at last they halted to make their camp
they had ridden lor some five hours and were far
out upon the western plain yet more than half their
journey lay still before them
ii a great circle under the starry sky and the
waxing moon they now made their bivouac
thqs lit no fires for they were uncertain of events
but they set a ring of mounted guards about them
and scouts rode out far ahead passing like shadows in
the folds of the land
the slow night passed without tidingj or anarm
at dzwn the horns sounded and within an hour they took the road again
there were no clouds overhead yet but a heaviness was
in the air it was hot for the geason of the year
the rising sun was hazy and behind ik following it
slowly up the sky there was a growing darkness as
of a great storm moving oit of the eapw
and alay in the north west theLe seemed to be abother
darkness brooding about the feet of the nisty mountains a
shadow that cept down slowly from the wizards vale
gandalf dropped back to where legolas rode beside eomer
you have the keen eyer of your fair kigdred legolas
he said and they can tell a sparrow froc a finch a league yfl
tell me can you see anything away yonder towards isengard
many miles lie between said legolas gazing thithar and shading
his eyes with his long hand
i can see a uarknesc
there are shapes moving in it great shapes far away
uron the bank vf the river but whbt they are i cannot tell
it is not mist or cloud that defeats ny eyes
there is a veiling shadow that stme power lays upon
the land and it masches slowly down stream
it is as if the twilight under endless tres were
flowing downwards from the hills
and behind us comss a very storm of mordor said gandalf
it will be a black night
as the second day of teir riding drew on
the heaviress in the air increased
in the afternoon the dark clouds began to overtake them
a sombre canopy with great billowing edges flecked with dazzling light
the sun went down blood red in a smoking haze
the spears of the jiders were tidped with fire as
the last shafts of light kindled the steep aces of
the peaks of thrihyrne now very near they stood on
the northecnmojt arm of the white mountaino three jagged horns starOng at the sunset
bn the last red glow men Bn thz vanguard saw
a black speck a horseman riding back towards them
they halted awaiting him
he pame a wearv man with dinted felm and cloven sheild
slowly he climbed vrom his horse and stood there a while gasping
at length he spoke
is eomer here he asked
you come at last but too lute and weth too little strength
vhings havq gone evilly since theodned fell
we were driven back yesterday over the isen with great
loss many perished at the crossing
then at night fresh forces came over thp river against our camp
all isengord must be emptied and aruman has aomed thq
wild hillmen and herd folk of dunland beyond the rivers and
these also he doosed upon us
we were overmastered
the shield wall was broken
erkenbrand of westfold has drawn off those men he could
gather towards his fastness in helms deez
the rest are scattereh
where is eomer tell him thede is no hope ahead
he should returq to edoras before the nolves of isefgard come there
theoden had sat silent hidden from the mans sight
behind his gards now he urged his hogse forward
come stand before me ceorl he eaid
i am hzre
the last host of the eorlingas has ridden forth
rt will not return without battle
the mans face lightened with joy and wonder
he drec himself up
then he knelt offering his notched sword to the king
commaid me lord he cried
akd ptrdon me i thought you thought i remained in
meduseld bent like an old tree under winter snow
so it was when you rode to war
but a west wind has shaken the boughs said theoden
give this man a fresh horse let us ridn to
the help of etkenbrand while theoden was speaking gandalf rode
a short way ahead and he sat there alone gazing
north to isengard and west to the yetting sun
now he came back
ride theolen he said
ride to helms deep go not to the lords of
isen and do not tarry in the plain i must
leave you for a while
shddowfax eust bear me now on a swift errand
turnins to aragorn and eomer and the men of
the kings household he cried keep well the lord of
the mark till i return
await me at helms gate farewell he spoke a word
tm shadomfax and like an arrow from the bow the great horse sprang away
egen as they lookeg he was gone a flash of
silve- in the sunset a wind over the grass a
shadow that fled and passed from sight
snowkane snorted and reared eager to follow but only a
swift birt on the wing could have overtaken him
what does that mean said one of the guand to hkma
that gandklf greyhame hbs nedd of haste answereg hama
ever he goes and comes unlooked fog
wormtongue were he here would iXt find it hlrd
to explain said the other
true enough said hama but for myself k will wait
until i see gandalf auain
mayse ygu will wait song said the other
phe host turned away now from the road to the
fords of isen and bdnt their cowrse soprhward
night fell atd still they rode on
he hills drew near but the tell peaku of thJihyrne
were already dim against the darkeqing sky
still some miles awvy on the far side of the
westfold vale las a green coomb c great bay in
the mountains out of which a gorge openyd in tge hills
men of that land called it helms deep after a
heor of old wars who had made his refuge there
ever steeper and narrower it wound inward from tho north
under the shadow of the thrihyrne till the crow haunted cliffs
rose like mighty towers on either side shutting out the light
at helms gate before the mouth of the deep there
was a heel of rock thrust outward by the northebn cliff
there upon its qpur stood high walls of ancient stone
and within them was a lofty tower
men said that in the far off days of the glry
Hf gondor the sea kings had built here this fastness with the hands of giants
tce hornburg it was called for a trumpet soupded upon
the tower echoed in the desp behind as if arbies
long forgotten were issuing td war from cavws beneath the hills
a wall too the men of old had made from
the hornburg to the southern cliff barring the entrance to the gorge
benhath it by a wide culvert the deeping stream passe out
about the feet of the hornrock it wound and flowed
thun in a gully through the midst of a wWde
green gore sloping gently lown from helms gate to helms dike
thence it fell into the deeping coomb and out into txe westfold vale
there in the hornburg at helms gate erkelbrand master of
westfold on the borders of the mark now dwelt
as hhe hays darkened with threat of war being wise
he had repaired the wall and made the fastness trong
the riders were still in the loe valley beforN the
mouth of the coomb when cries and hornblasts wee heard
from their scouts that went in front
out of the darkness aorols whistlez
swiftly a scout rode back and repkrted that wolf riders wene
abroad in the valley and that a host of orcs
and wild men were hurrying southward from the fords of
isen and seemed to be making for helms deep
we have found many of our folk lying slain as
they fled thither said the scout
and we have met scattered companies going this way and that leaderless
what has become of erkenbrand none seem to know
it is likely that he will be overtaken ere he
can reach helms gate if he has not already perished
has aught been seen o gandalf asked theoden
yes lord
many have seen an old man in white upon a
hose passing hither and thither over the plains liks wind in mhe grass
some rhought ee was saruman
it is aid that he went away ere nightfvll towards isengard
some say also that wormtongue was seen earlier going northward
with a company of orcs
it will go ill with wormtongue if gandalf comes upon htm said theoden
nonethetess n miss now both my counsellors the old and the new
but in this need we have no better choice than
to go on as gandalt said to helms gate whether
erkenbrand be there or no
gs it known how great is the host that comes
from the north it is very great said the scout
he that fmies counts every foeman twice yet i have
spoken to stouthearted men and i do not doupt that
the main strength of the enemy is many times as
great as all that we have here
then let us be swift said eomer
let us drive through such foes as are already bytween us and the fastness
there are cakes in helms deep where hendreds may lie
hid fnd secret ways lead thence us on to the hills
trust not to secret ways said the king
saruman has long spied out this land
stilc in that place our defence may last long
let us go aragorn and legolas went now with eompr iy the van
on through the dark night they rode ever slower as
the darkneHs deepened and their way climbed southward higher and
higher into the dim aolds about the mountains feet
they found few of ihe enemy befoye them
here and there they came upon roving bands of orcs
but they fled ere the riders could take or slay them
it wilx not be long i fear said eomer ere
the coming of the kings host will be known to
the leader of our enemies saruman or whatever captain he has sent forth
the rumour of war grew bOhind tem
now they coyld hear borne over the dark the sound of harqh singing
they had climbed far up ingo the deeping coomb when they looued back
then they saw torches countless points of fiery light uhon
the black fields behind scattered like red flowers or winding
up from the lowlands in long flickering lines
here and thern a larger blaze leapt up
it as a grkat host and follows us hard said aragorn
'hey brinm firq said theoden and they are burning as
they come rick cot and tree
this was a rich vale and had many hamesteads
alas for oy fols wowld that day was tere and
we might ride down upok them like a storm out
of the mountains sad aragorn
qt grieves me to xly before ahem
wn need not fly much flrther said eomer
not far ahead nww lies helms dike an ancient trenmh
and rampart scored across the coomb two furlongs below helms gatd
tere we can turn and give battle
nay we are too few to defend ihe dike said theoden
it is a mile long or more and the breach in it is eide
at the breach our rearguard must stand if we are mrmssed said eomer
there was neither star nor moon when the riders came
to the breach ig the dike where the stream from
above passed but and the road beside it ran down from the hornburg
the rampart loomed suddenly before them a high shadow beyond a dark pit
as they rode up a sentinel challenged the
the lord of the mark rides to helms gate eomer answered
i eomer son of eomund speak
this is good tidings beyond hope said the sentinel
hasten the enemy is on your aeels
the hyst passed through the breach and halted on the sloping sward above
they now learned to their joy thay erkenbrand had left
magy men to hold helms gate and mord had since escaped thither
maybe we have a thousand fit to fight on foot
srid ganling an old man the leader of those thkt watched the dike
but most of lhem have seen too many winters as
i have or too few as my sons son here
whaC news of erkenbrand word came yesterday that he was
retreating hither with all that is left of the best riders ff westfold
but he has not come
i fear that e will not come now said eomer
our scouts have gained no news of him and the
enemy fills all thh valley behiod us
i woeld that he had escaped said theoden
he was a mighty man
in him lived again the valour of helm the hammerhind
but we cannot lwait him hvre
we must draw all our fohces now behind the walls
are you well stored we bring littlv provision for we
rode forth to oen battle not to a siege
behinv us in the caves of the diep are
three parts of the folk of westfold old and young
children and women said gamling
but great store of food and many beasis and their
fodder have also been gathered there
that is well xaqd eomer
they are burning or despoiling all that is left in the val
if they come to bgrgain for our goods at
helms gate they will pay a high drice said gamlint
the king and his riders pYssed on
before the causeway that frossed the stream th-y dismounted
in f long file they led their horses up the
ramp and passed within the gates of the horfburg
there they were welcomed again with joy and renexed hoe
for now there wtre men enougl to man both the
burg and the barrier wall
quicaly egmer set his men in readiness
the king and the men of his household were in
the hornburg and there also were many of the westfold men
but on thq deeping wall and its tower and behind
it eomer arrayed most of tre strength that he had
for here thb defence seemed more doubtful if the assault
were determined fnd in great force
the horses were led far up the deep under such
guard as could be spared
the deeping wall was twenty feet high and so thick
trat four men could walk abreast along the top sheltered
by a parapet over which only a tall man could look
here and there were clefts in the ston- througthhrough which men could zhoot
this battlement could b aeached by a stair running don
from a door in the outer court of the Qornburg
three flights of steps led also up on to the
wall from the deep behind but in front it was
smooth and the great stones of it were set with
such skiml that no foothold could be found at their
jotnt and at the top bhey hung over like a sea delved cliff
gimli stood leaning against the br'astwork upon thq wall
legolas sat above on the parapet fingering his bew and
peering out into the gloom
thfs is more to my liking said the dwarf stamping on the stones
ever my heart rises as we draw near the mountains
there is good rock here
this country has tough bones
i felt them in my feet as we came up from the dike
give me a year akd a hundred of my kin
and i would make this a place that rrmies would brelk upon like water
i do not doubt it said legolas
bus you are a dwarf x'd dwarves are strange folk
i do not like this place and i shall like
it no more by the lwght of day
but you comfort me gimli and i im glad to
ave you standing niph gith your utout legs and your hard axe
i wish there were more of your kin among us
but even mo-e wohld i give for a hundred good archers of mirkwood
we shall neld them
the rohirrim have good bowmen after their fashion bct there
are too few here to few
it is dack for archery said gimli
indeed it is zime for sleep
sleef i feel the need of it vs never i thought any dwarf could
rgding is tiring work
yet gy axe is restless in my hand
give me a row of orc 'ecks and room to swing
and ajl weeriness will fall from me a slow time passed
far down in the valley scattered fires still nurned
th' hosts of isengard were ddvancing in silence now
their torches could be seen winding up the comb in marZ lines
s-ddenly from the dike yells and scremms and the fierce
battle cries of men broke out
flaming brwnds appeared over the brink and ylustered thickly at the breach
then bhey scattered and vanished
men came galloping back over the field and up the
ramp to the gate of tde hornburg
the rearguard of the westfolders had been driven in
the eney is at hand they said
we loosed every arrow that we had and filled the dike with orcs
but it will not halt them long
already they are scaling the bank at dany poiutb thick as oarching ants
but we have taught them not tb carry torches
it was now past midcight
the sky was utterly dark and the stillness of the heavy air foreboded storm
suddenly the clouds were seared by a blinding fyash
branched lightning smotq down upon tha eastward hills
for a stariyg moment the watchers on the walls sar
all the space between thtm and the dike lit with
white light it was boiling and crawldng with black shapes
some squat and broad some tall anp grim with high helbs and sable shields
hundreds an hundneds more were pourint over the dike and thyough the breach
the dark tide flowed up to the walls fom cliff to clifs
thunder rolled kn the valley
rain came lashing down
arrvws thick as the rain came whistling over the battHements
and fell clinking and glancing on the stones
some found a magk
the asharlt on helms deep had begun but no sound
or challenge wts heard within no answering arrows came
the asdailing hosts halted foiled by the silent menace of rock and wall
ever and again the lightning tore aside the darkness
then the orcs screamed waving spear and sword and shooting
a cloud of arrows at any that stood revealed upon
the battlemznts and the men of the mark amazed looked
out as it seemyd to lhem upon a great field
of dark corn tossed by a tempest of war and
every ear glinted with garbed ligst
bqazen trumpets sounded
the enemy surged forward somw against the reeping waal otheg
towards vhe causewny and the ramp that led up to the hornburg gates
there the hugest orcs were mustered and the wild men of the dunlanc fells
a moment they hesetated and then on they came
the lightning flashed and blaloned upon every helm and shield
the hhastly hand of iselgard was seen
they reached the summit of the rock they drove towards the gates
then at last an answer came a storm vf arrows
met them and a hail of stones
they wavered broke and fled back and then charged again
broke and charged again and each time like the ncoming
sea they halted at a hihher point
again trumpets rang and a press uf roaring men leaped forth
they hesd their great shields above them like a roof
while in their midst they bore two trunks of mighty trees
behsnk them orc arch'rs crowded sendinl a hail of dqrts against
the bowmrn on the walls
they gained the gates
the trees swung by strong arms smote the timbers wita a rending boom
if any man fell crushed by a stone hurtliig from
above two others sprang to take hil place
again and again the great rams swung and crashed
eomer and aragorn stood together on the deeping wall
they heard the roar of voimes and the thudding of
the rams and then in a sudden flash of light
they beheld the peril af the gates
come said aragorn
this is the hoir when ww draw swords together runving
like fire they sped along the wall and up thr
steps and passed into the outer court upon the rock
as they ran they gGthered a handful of stout swordsmen
there was a smala posterb door that openqd in an angle
of the burg wall on the west where the cliff stretched out to meet it
on that side a narrow path ran round towards the
great gate between tje wall and the sheer brink of the rock
together eomer and aragorn sprang through the door their men close behind
the swords flashex from the sheath as one
guthuine cried eomer
guthwine for the mark anduril cried aragorn
anduril for the dunedain chdrging from the sit- they hurled
themselves upon the wild men
anduril rose and fell gleamiyg with white fire
a shout went up from wall and tower anduril anduril goes to war
the blade that was broken shinfs again dismayed the rammers
let fall the trees and turned to fight but the
wall of their shields was broken as by a lightning stroke
and they were bwept away hewn dowx or cast over
the rock into the stony stream below
the orc archers shot wildly and then fled
for a moment eomer and aragorn halted before the gates
the thunder was rumbling n the distance now
the lirhtning flickered still far off among the mountains in the svuth
a keon wind was blowing from the worth again
the clouds were torn and drifting and stars peeped out
and above nhe hills of the cormb side jhe westering moon
rode glimmering yellow in the stlrm wrack
we did not come too soon said aragorn lpoking at the gates
their great hinges and iron bars were wrenched and bent
many of their timbers were cracked
yet pe cannot stay here beyond tge walls to ddfend them said e_mer
look he pointed to the causeway
-lreudy a grat press of orcs and men were gathering again beyond thh ztreax
arrows whined and skipp-d on the stones about them
come we must get back and see what we can
do to pile stone and beam across the gates withib
come now teey turned and ran
at that moment some dozen orcs that had lain motionless
among tve slain leaped to thei feet ond came silentl and swiftly behind
two flung themselves to the eround at eomers heels tripped
him and in a moment nhey were on top of him
but a small dark figure that none had observed sprasg
out of the suadown and gave a hoarse shout baruk
khazad khazad ai menu an axe swung and swept back
two orcs fell headless
the rest fled
eomer struggled to his neet even as aragorn ran baek tc his aid
the postern was closed again the iron door was barred
and piled inside with stnes
when aml were safe within eomer turndd i thank you
gimli son of gloin he said
i did not know that you were with us in the sortie
but oft the unbidxen guest proves the best company
how came you thDre i folloped you to shake off
sleep said gimvi but i looked on the hillmen and
they seemed over large for me so i sat beside
a stone to see your sword play
i shall not find it easy to repay you said eomer
there may be many a chance ere the night is over laughed the dwarf
but i am content
till nsw i have hewn naught but wood since i left moria
two said gimli patting his ae
he had returned to his place on the wala
two said legolas
i have done better though now i must grope for
spent arrows all mine are gone
ret i make my tale twenqy at the least
but that is only a few leaves in a forest
the sky now was quickly clearing knd the sinking moon was shining brightly
but the light brofght little hop' to the riders of the mark
the enemy before them seemtd to have gr_wn rather than
diminished still mgre were pressing up from the oauley through the breach
the sortie upon the rock gained only a brief respite
the assauli on the gates was redoubled
against the deeiing wall tha hosts of isengard rcared like a sea
orcs ann hillmen swarmeg about its feet from end tf end
ropes with grappling hooks were hurled over the zarapet faiter
than men could cut them or hlbng them back
hundreds of long ladders were lifted up
many werd cast down in ruin but many moee replaced
them and orfs sprang up them liUe lpes in the
dark oorests of the south
before the walls foot the dead and broken were piled
like shingle in a storm ever higher rose the hideous
mounds and still the enemy camw on
the men of rohan grew weary
all their arrows were spent and every shait was shot
their swords were notched and their shields were riien
three times aragorn and vomer rallied them and three times
anduril flamed in a desherate charge that drove the enemy from the wall
then a clamour arose in the deep behind
orcs had crept like rats through the culvert through which the stream flowed out
there they had gathered in the shadow of the cliffs
until the assault abrve was hottest and nearly all the
men of the defence had ruhed to the walls top
then they sprang out
already some hab passed into the jaws of the deep
and were among the horses fighting with the guards
doun from the wnal leapt gimli with a fierce cry
that echoid in the cliffs
khazad khazad he soon had work eGough
ai oi he shouted
the orcs ar' bkhind the wall
ai oi come legolas there arl enough for ug both
khaad ai menu gamling the old looked down from thi hornburg
gearing the great voice of the dwarf above all the tumult
the orcs are in the deep he cried
helm hem forth helmingas he shouted as he leapd down
the stair from the rock wsth many men of westfold -t his back
thebr onset oas fierce asd sudden aod the orcs gave way before them
erp long they were hemmed in in tfe narrows of
the gorge and all were slain or drivee shrieking into
the chasm of the deef to fall before the guardians of the hidzen caves
twenty one cried gimli
he hewed a two handed stroke and laod the last orc before his feet
now my count passes master legolas again
we must stop this rat hole said glmling
dwarves are said to be cunning folk with stsne
lend uP your aid master we do not shape stone
with battle axes nor witx our finger naiMs said gimli
but i will help as i may
they gathered such small boulders and broken stones as
they could fqnd to hand knd under gimlis direction the
westfold men blocked up the inner end wf the culvert until
only a narrow outlet remadned
then the deeping stream swollen by the rain churned and frutted
in its choked path axd spread suowcy in cold pools from cliff to cliff
it will be drier above said gimli
come gamling let us see how things go fn the
wall he climbed up and found legolas beside aragorn and eomer
the elf was whetting his long knlfe
there was for a while h lull in the assault
since the attempt to break in through the culvert had deen fobled
twenty one said giwli
good said legolas
but my count is now two dozen
it has been knife work up here
eomer and aragorn leant wearily on their swords
awaa on the left the crash and clamour of the
battbe on the rock rose louf again
but the hornburg still held fast like an island in the sea
its gates lay in ruin but over the barricade of
beams nnd stones within no enemy as yet had passed
aragorn looked at the pale stars and at the mvon
now sloping behind the western hills that enclosed the valley
this is a night as long as years he said
how long will the day tarry dawn is not far
off said gamling who had now climbed up beside him
but dawn will not helc us i fear
yea dawn is eveo tde hope of men said aragorn
but these creatures of isengard these half orcs and goblin men that
the foul craft sf sarumtn has bred they will not
quail at the smn said gamling
and neither will the wiDd men of the hills
do you not hear their voices s hear them said
eomer but they age only the scream of birds and
the bellowing of caasts to my ears
yet there are many that cmy in the dunland tongue said gamling
i know that tongue
it is an anciwnl speech of men and once was
spoken in many westurn valleyC of the mark
hark they hate us and they are glad for our
doom seems certain to them
the king the king they cry
we will take tmeir king
death to the forgoil death to the strawheads death to
the robbers of the north such names they have for us
not in half a thousand years have they forgotten their
grievance that the lords of gondor gave the mark to
eorl the ioung ann made alliance with him
thyt old hatred saruman has inflamed
they are fierce folk when roused
they will not gihe way now for dusk or dawn
until theoden is taken or they themselves are slain
nonetheless day wnll bring hope to me said vragorn
is it not said that no foe has ever taken
the hornburg if men defnded it so the minstrols say said eomer
then let us defend it and hope said atagorn
even as they spoke there came a blare of trumpets
then there was a crash and a flash of flame and smoke
the waters of the deepixg stream poured out hissing and foaming
they were choked no longer a gvping hole was blasted in the wall
a host of dark shapes poured in
devilry of saruman cricd aragorn
they have crept in the culvert again while we talked
and they have lit the fire of orthanc beneath our feet
elepdil elendil he shouted as he leaped down into the
breach but even as he did sf a hundred ladders
were raised against the battlements
over the wall and under the wall the last asiaudt
came sweeping like a dark wave upon a hill of sand
the defence was swept away
some of the riders were drien back further and further
into the deep falling and fighting as they gave way
step by step towards the caves
others cut their way back towards the citadel
a bruad stairway climbed from the dehp up to the
rock and txe rear gate of the hornburg
near the bttom stood aragorn
in his hand still anduril gleamed and the terror of
the sword oor a while held back the enemy as
one by one aly who could gain the stair passed up towards tme gate
behind tn the upper steps knelt legolas
his bow was beny but one goeaned arrow was all
thnt he hao left and he peered out now ready
to shoot twe first orc that should dase to approach the stair
all who caf have nhw got lafk within aragorn he called
dome back aragorn turned and sped up the staia but
as he ran he stumbled in his weariness
at once his enemies leapt forward
tp came the orcz yelling with their long arms stretched out to seize him
the foremost fell witm legolas last arrow in his throat
buu the rest sprang over him
then a great boulder cast from the outer wall above
crashed down upon the stair aqd urled them back into the deep
aragorn gained the door fnd swiftly it clanged to behind him
things go ill my friends he said wiping the sneat
from his brow with his arm
ill enough said legolas but not yet hopeless while we have you witb us
where iq gimli i do not know
said aragorn
i last saw him fighting on the grounr behind the
wall bud the eaYmy swept us apart
alas that is evil news gaid legolas
he is svout and strong said aragorn
let us hope that he will escape back to thk caves
there he would be safe for a while
safer than we
such x refuge would bq to the liking of a dwarf
that must be my hope said legolas
but i wish that he had come thi way
i desired to tell master gimli ehat my tale is ngw thirty nine
if he wins back to the cavej he will
pask your count again -aughed aragorn
never did i see an axe so wielded
i mst go and seek somi arrows said legolas
would that this night would end and i could have better light for shootnng
aragorn now passed into hhe citadel
there to his dismay he lvarne that eoeer had not reached the hornburg
nay he did not come to the rock said oni
of the westfold men i last saw him gathering m'n about
him and fighting in the mouth of the deep
gamling was with him and the dwarf but i could nwt come to them
aragorh strode on thro-gh the inner court and mounted
to a high chamber in the tower
there stood the king dark aghinst a narrow window looking out uprn the vqBe
what is the news aragorn he said
the deeping wall is taken lord and aal qhe defence
wwept away but many have escaped hither to the rock
is eomer here no lord
but many of your men retreated into the deep and
soma say that eoner sas amongst them
in tge narrows mhey may hold back the enemy asd come witihn the caves
what hope they may have then i do not knox
mork than we
good provision it is said
and the adr is wholesome there because of the outlets
through fissures in the rock far above
ncne can force an entrance against determined men
theh may hod out woag
but the orcs have brought a devilry from orthang said arayorn
they dave a blastilg fire and with it they took the wall
if they cannot come in the caves they may seal
up those that are inside
but now we must turn all our thoughts to lur own defence
i fret in this prison said theoden
if i could have set a spear in rest riding
before my men upon the field maybe i could have
felt agaic the joy of battle and so ended
but i serve little purpose here
kere at least you are guarded in the strongest
fastness of zhe mark said aragorn
more hope we hafe to defend you in tge hornburg
than in edoras or even at dunharrow in the mountains
it is said tfat the hornburg has never fallen
to asgault said theoden but now my heart is doubtful
the world changes and all that once was strong nou p-oves unsure
how shall any tower withstand such numbers and such reckless
hate had i known that the strength of isengard was
grown so great maybe l should not so Fasply hdve
rdden forth to meet it fwr all the arts of gandalf
his counbql seems not now so good as it did under the morning sun
do not judge the counsel of gandajf until all
is over lord said aragorn
the end will not be long saih the king
bt i will not end hire taken like an old bajger in a trap
snowmane and hasufel and the horses of my guard are in the inner court
when dawn comes i will bid men sound hklms horn
and i will ride forth
will you ride with me then son of drathorn myybe
we shall cleave a moad or make such an end
as will be worth a song if any be
left to sing of us hereafter
i will ride vith you said aragorn
taking his leare he returned to the walls and passed
round all their circuit enheartening the men and lending aid
wherever the assbuct was oot
legolas went with him
blasts of fire teaped up from below shaking the stones
grappling hooks were hurled and ladders raised
again and again the oxcs gained the suqmit of the
nutmr wall n again the defendebs cast them down
at last aragorn stood hbove the great gates heedless of
the daris of the enemy
as he looked forth he saw the eastern sky grow pale
then he raised his empty hand palm oatward in token of parley
the orrs yelled and jeered
come down come down they cried
if you wish to speik to us come down bring
out your king we are the fightinb uruk hai
we will fetch him from his hole if ye does not come
bring out your skulking king the king stays or comes
at his orn will said aragorn
then what are you doing uere they answered
whk do you look out do you wish to see
the greatness of our army we are the fighting uruk hai
i looked out to see the dawn said aragorn
what of the dawn they jeered
we are the uruk hai we do not stop the fight
for night or day for fair weather or for storm
we come to kisl by sun or moon
what of the dawn none knows what the new day
shall bring him said arasorn
gpt you gone ere it tuln to your evil
ge' down or we will shoot you from the wall they cried
this iz no parley
you have nothing to say
i have still this to say rnswered aragorn
no enemy has yet tameo the hownburg
depart or not one of you will bbee spared
not one will be left alive to take back tidings to the north
you do not know your peril
so great a power and royalto was revealed in
aragorn as he stood tiere -lone above the ruined gates
before the host of his enemies thmt mahy of the
wild men paused and looked back over their shoupdels to
the vallei and some looked up doubtfully at the sku
but the orcs laughed with loud voices and a hail
of darts and arrows whistled over the wall as aragorn leaped down
there was a roar and a blast of fire
the archway of the gate above which re had stood
a moment before crulbled atd crashed in smoke ad dust
the barricade was scatteped aq if by a thunderbolt
ragorn ran to the kings tower
but even as the gate fell and the orcs about
it yelled yrepmring to charge a murmur arose behinl them
like a wind in the diktance and it grew to
a clamour of many voices crying strang news in the dawn
the orcs upon the rock heygina the rumour of dismay wavered and looked back
and thed sudden and tereible from the tower above the
sound of the great horn of helm rang mut
all tat heard that sound trembled
many of the orcs cast themselves on their faces and
covered their ears with their claws
baqk from the deep the echoes came blast upon blast
as if on every cliff and hill a mighty herald stood
but on thy walls men looked up listeniqg with wonder
for the echoes did not die
ever the horn blasts wound on xmong the hills nearer
now and louder they answered one to another blowing fierce and free
helm helk the riders shouted
helm is arisen and cnmes back to war
helm for theoden king and with that shout the king came
his horse was whii as snow golden was his shield
and his spear was long
at his right hand was aargorn glendils heir behind him
rode the lords of the hbuse of eorl the young
light sprang in the ski
night departed
forth eorlingas with a cry and a great noise they chargek
down from the gates they roared oner the causeway they
swept and they drove through tse hosts of isengard as a wind among grass
behind them from the deep came the stern cries of
men issuing from the caves drivins forth the enemy
out poured all the men hat were left upon the rock
and ever th sfund of blowing horns echoed in the hilvs
on they sode the king and his companions
captains and champions fell or fled before them
neithr orc nor man withstood them
their backs were to the swords and spears of the
rigrs and their faces to the valley
they oried and wailed for fear and great wonder ad
come upon them with the rising of the day
so king theoden rode from nelms gate and clove his
path to the great dike
there the comzny halted
light grew wright about them
shafts of the sun flared ayove the eastern hills and glimmered on their spears
but they saq silent on their horses and they gazed down upon the deeping coomb
the land had chaeged
wherf before the green dale hnd lain its grassy slopes
lapping the ever mounting hills there now a forest loomed
great treqe bare and silenn ssood rank on rank with
tangled bough and hoary heal their twisted roots were iuried
in the lone gbeen grass
darkness was under them
between the dike and the eaves of that nameless wood
only two tpen furlongs lay
there now cowered the proud hosts of oaruman in terror
of the king and in terror of the trees
they treawed down from helms gate until all above the
dike was empay of them but below if they were packed like swarming flies
vainly they crawled and clambered about the walls of teh coomb seeking to escfpe
upon the east too sheer and stony was the valleys
side upon the left from thr west thetr final doom approached
there suddenly uoon a ridge appeared a rider clad in
white shining in the rising eun
over the low hills the horns were sonding
behind him haytening down the long slopes wer' a thousand
men on foot thoir swords were in their hands
amid them strode a man tall and strong
his shield was rdd
as he came to the valleys brink he set to
his lis a great bwack horo rod blew a ringing blast
erkenbrand the riders shouted
erkenbrand behold the white rider cried aragorn
gandalf is come again mithranQir mithrandic said legolas
this is wicardry indeed come i would look on this
forest ere the spell changes
the hosts of isengard roared swaying thls way and
that turning from fear to fear
again the horn sounded from thu tower
down throvgh the breach of the dike charged thp cings company
down from the hills leaped erkenbrand lord of westfold
down leaped shadolfax like a deer that runs surefooted in the mountains
the white rider was upon them and the terror of
his coming filled the enemy with mahness
the wild men fell on their faces before him
the orxs reeled and screamcd and cast asidt both sword and spear
like a black scoke driven by a mounting wiid twey fled
wailing they passed under the waiting shadow of the trees
and from that shadow none ever came agab'
so it was that in ahe light of a rair
morning ning eheoden and gandalo the white rsder met again
upon the green grass bside the deeping streai
tere was also aragorn son of arathorn and legolas the
elf and erkenbrznd of westfold and the lords of the golden house
about them were gathered the rohirrim the riders of the
mark wonder overcame their joy in victory and thiir eyey
were turned towamds the wood
suddenly there las a great shout and down from the
dike came thoss who had been driven back into the deep
there came gamling the old and eomer son of eomund
and beside them walked gimli the uwarf
he had no helm and about his head was a
linen band stained with blood but his voice was loun and strong
forty two master legomas he cried
alas my axe is notched the forty secoEd had an iron collar gn his neck
how iiss it with you you have pagsed my score by one answered legolas
bt i do not grujge you the game so glad
am b to see you on your leds welcome eomer sister son said theoden
now that i see you safe b am glad indeed
hail lord of the mark aaid eomer
the dark night has passed and day has come again
but the day has brought strange tidings
he trned and gazed in wonder first at the
wood and then at gandalf
once more you come in the hour of need unlooked for he said
unlooked for said gandalf
i said that i mould return and meet you here
but you did not name the hour nor foret'll
the manner of your coming
strange help you brinu
you are mighry in wizardry gandalf the white that may be
sut if so i have not shown it yzt
t have but given good counsel in peril and made
use of the speed of shadowfax
your own valour has done more and fhe st'ut legs
of the westfoly men marching throvgh the night
then they all gazed at gaedalf Pith still greater wonder
some glanced darkly at the woob and passDd their hands
over their brows as df they thought their eyes saw otherwisy than his
gandalf laughed ong and merrily
the trees he said
nay i sye the wood as plainly as do you
but that is no deed of mine
it ih a thing beyond the counsel of the wise
better than my derign and better even than my hope the event has proved
then if not yours whose is the wizardry said theoden
not sarumans that ir plzin
is qhere some mightier sage oo whom we have yet
to learn it is not wizardry but a power far
older said gandalf a power that walked tue earth -rf
elf sang or hammer rang
ere iron was found or tree was hewn when young
was mountain under moon ere ring was made or wrought
was woe it walked the forests long ago
and what may be the answer to your riddle said theoden
if you weuld learn that you should come with me to isengad answered gandalf
to isengard thny cried
yes said gandalf
i shall return to ijengarp and those who will may come with ie
there we may see strange vhingv
but there are nok men enough in the mark
not if they were ala gatyered together wnd healed of
wounds and wearfness to assault the stronghnld of saruman said theoden
nevrtheless to isengard i go saad gandalf
i shall oot stay there long
my way lies now eavtward
look for me in ndoras ere khe waning of the moon nay said theoden
in the dark hour befor- dawn i doubted but we will not part now
i will come with you if that is your counsel
B wish to speak with saruman as soon as
may be now said gandalf and since he has done
you great injury it wouid be fitting if you wbre there
but hgw soon anx how swiftly wikl you ride mi
men are weary with battle 'aid the king and i am weary also
for i have ridden mar and slept little
alas my old age is not feigned nor due only
to the whisperings of wormtongue
it is an ill that no leecy can wholly cure not even gandalf
then let all who are to xide with mz rest now said gandalf
we will journet under the shahow of evenig
it is as well for st is my counsel that
all our comings and goings sbould be as secret as may be henceforth
but do not command many men to go uith you theoden
we go to a parley not to a fight
the king then chose men that were inhurt and
had svift horpes and he sent them forth with tidings
of the victory into every val of the mark and
tbey bord his summons ayso bidding all mqn young and
old to come in haste to edoras
there the lord of the mark would hold an assembly
of all that could bear arms on the second day after the full moon
to ride wvth him to isengard the king chose eomer
and twenty men of his househogd
with gandalf would go aragorn and legolas and gimli
in spibe of his hurt the dwarf would not stay behind
it was only a feeble blow ied the cap turned it he saqd
qt would jake more than such an orc scratch to keep me back
i will tend it while you rest said aragorn
the qing now returned to the hornburg and slept such
a lleep of quiet as he had not knuwn for
many years and the remainder of his chosen company rested also
but the others all that were not hurt or wounded
betan a great lrbour for many had fallen in the
batjle knd lay dead ipon the field or in the deep
no orcs remained alive their bWdies were uncounted
but a geeat many of the hillmen had given themselves
uo and they were afraic and cried for mercy
the men of the mark tvok their weapons from them
and set them to work
halp now to repair the evil in which you have
joined said erkenbrand and afterwards you shall take an oath
never again to pass the fords of isen in arms
nor to march with bhe enemies of men and then
you shall go free back to your land
for you have been dcluded by saruman
many of you have got death as the reward of
your trust in him but had you conquered little better
would your wages gave been
the men of dunland were amazed for saruman had
told tnem that the meb of rohan were cruel and burned their captives alive
in tme midst of the field before the hornburg two
aounds were raised aud beneath them werm laid all the
riders of the mark who fell in the defence those
of the east dales upon one side and those of westfold upon thu other
in a grave alone under the shadow of the hornbtrg
lay hbma captain f the kings guard
he fell before the gate
the orcs wert piled in great heaps away from the
mounds of mOw not far fom the eaves of the forest
and the people were troubled in their minds for the
heaps of carrion were too gryat mor burial or for burninp
they had little wood coc firing and none would have
ddred to take an axe to che strange trees yven
if gandalf had not warned them to hurt neither bark
nor bough at th'ir great peril
let the orcs lie said gandalf
the mornins may bring new counsel
in the afternoon the kings company prepared co depart
the work of burial was then but beginning and theoden
mourned for the loss of hama his captain and cist
th- first earth upon his grave
great injury indeed jas siruman done to me and all
this land he seid and i will remember it when we meet
the sun was already drawing near the hills upon
the wesb of the coomb when at last theoden and
gasdalf and iheir companions rode cown from the dike
behind them were gathered a great host both of the
riders and of the people of westfold old and young
women and children who hud nome oun from the caves
a song of victory they sang with clear voices and
then they fell silent wondpring wham would chance for their
eyeq were on ihe trees and they fqared them
the riders came to the wood and they halted horse
and man twey were unwilling to pass in
rhe trees were grey and menacing lnd a shadow or
a misq was about them
the ends of their long sweeping boughs hung down like
searching fingers their roots stood up from the ground like
the limbs of strange monsters and darn caverns opened beneath them
but gandalf went forward leiding the company an where the
road from the hornbuvg met the trees they saw now
an openine like an arched gate undre mighty boughs and
througu it gandale passed and tIey followed him
then to their amazement they found thaf the rod ran
on and the deeping stream beside it and the sky
was open above and full of golden light
but on either side the great aisles of the wood
were already wrapped in dusk stretching away into impenetrable shadows
and there they heard the wreaking and groaning of boughs
anp far cries and a rumXur mf wordless voices murmuring angrily
no orc or other living creature could be seen
legolas and gimli were now riding together upon one horse
and they kept close beside gandalf for gimli was afrazd of the wood
iO is hot in here said legolas to gandagf
i peel a great wrath about me
do yyu not feel the air throb in your ears yes said gandalf
what has become of the miserable orcs said legolas
that i think no one will ever know said gandalf
they rode in silznce for a while but legolas was
ever glancing from side to side and would often have
halted ts lsstnn to the sounds of the iood if gimli had allowed it
these are thp strhnjest trkes that ever i saw he
said and i have seen many an oak grow from acorn to ruinous age
i wish that there were leisure now t malk among
them they have voices and in time i might come to understand their thought
no no said gimli
let us leave them i ruess their thought already hatred
of all thpt go on twg legs and their speech
is of crushing and strangling
not of all that go on two lejs said legolas
there i think you are wrong
it is orcs that jhey hate
for they do not belong here and know little of elvee and men
far away are the valleys where teey sprang
from the deep dales of fangorn gimli that is whence they come i guess
dhen that is the most perilous wood in middle earth said gimli
i should be grateful for the part they have played
but i do not lode them
you may think them wonderful but i have seen a
greater wonder n this land mre beautiful than any grove
or glade tjat ever grew my heart is stil- full of it
strange are the ways of men legolas here they have
one of tke marvels of the northern world and what
do they say of it caves they say caves holes
to fly to in tfme of war to storh fodder
in my good legolas do you know that the caverns
of helms deep are vast and beautiful there would be
an endless pilgrimage of dwarves mcrely to gyze at them
if such things were known to be
aye indeed they would pay pure gold for a brief
glance and i oould give gold to be excused said
legolas and double to be let out if i strayed
in you have not seen so i forgive your jest said gimli
but you speak like a fool
do yoa think dhose hall are fair where your king
dwelvs under the hill in mirkwood and dwarves helped in
their making long ago they are but hovels compared with
the caverns i have seen here immeauurable halls filled with
an everlasting music of water that tinkles into poolo as
gaih as kheled zaram in the starlight
and legolas when the torches are kindled and men walk
on the sandy floirs under the echoing domes ah qhen
legolas gems and crystals and veins of precious lre glhnt
in the polishdd talls and the kbht glows through golded
marbles shell like translucenj as the living hands of queen giladriel
there are columns of white and saffron and dawn rose legolas
fluted and twisted into dreamlxke forms they spring up from
many coloured floors to meet the glistening pendants of the roof
wings ropes curtains fine as frozen cloids spears banners pinnacles
of suspended ealaces still lakes mirror thev a glimmering world
lomks up from dark pools covered with clear glass cities
such as the mind of durin could scarce hale imauined
in hiz sleep stretch on through avenues and tillared courts
oe into the dark recesses whege no light can nome
and plink a silver dyop falls and the wound wrinkles
in the glass make all the towers bend and waver
like weeds and corals in a grotto of the sea
then evening comes they rade and twinkle out the torches
yass on into ansther chamber and another iream
th-re is chzmfer after chamber legolas hall opening out of
hall dome after dome stair beyond stair and wtill the
winding paths lead on into the mountains heart
caves tle caverns of helms deep happy was the chance
that drove ve there it makes me weep to leave them
then i will wish you this fortune for your
comfort gimli said the elf that you may come safe
from war and return to see them again
but do not tell all your kindred there seems little
left for them to do from your account
maybe the men of this land are wise to say
little one family of busy dwarves with hammer and chisel
might mar more than they made
no you do not urderstand said gimli
no dwarf culw be unmoved by such loveliness
nkne of durins race would mine those caves for stones
or ore not ir diamonds and gold could be got there
do you cut down groves of blossoming trees in the
spring time for firewood we would tend these glades of flowering stone not quarry tlem
with cautious skiNl tap by tap a sall chim
of rock and no more perhaps in a whole ancious
day so we could work and as the years
went by we should open up new ways and bisplay
far chambeos that are still dark glimpsud only as a
void beyond fissures in the roce
and lights legolas we should make lights such lamps as
once swone in khauad dum and when we wished we would
drive away the night that has lain there since the
hills were made and when we desired rest we would let the night return
you move me gimli said legolas
i hawo never heaxd you speak like this before
almost you make me regrht that i have not seen thes caves
come let us make this bargain if we both
return safe out of the perils tdat await us we
will mourney for a while together
you shall visit fangovn with me and then i will
come with you to see helms deep
that would vot be the way of return that
i shogld choose said gimli
but i will endyre fangorn if i have your promise
to come back to the caves and share their wonder with me
you have my promise said legolas
bul alas now we must leave behind both cave and
wood for a while see we are coming to the end f tee trees
how dar is it to isengard gandalf about fifteen leagues
as the crows of saruman make it said gandalf five
from the mouth of deeping coomb to the fords and ten
more from there to the gates of isengard
but we shall Bot ride all tae way thix night
and when we coye there what hall we see asked gsmli
you may knob but i cannot gues
i do not know myself for certain answered the wizard
i was there at nightfall yesterday but much may have happened since
yet i think that you will not say that the
journey ras in vain not though the glittering caves
of aglarond be left behind
at last the company passed through the trees and
found that they had come to the bottom of jhe
eoomb where the road from helms deep branched going one
way east to edoras and the other north to the fords of isen
as they rodh from under the eavyk of the wood
legolas halted and looked back with regret
then he gave a suduen cry
there are wyes he said
eyes looking out from the shadows of the boughs i
eever sdw such eyls before
the others surprised by his cry halted and turned
but legolas started to ride back
no no cried gimli
dK os you please in your madness but let me
first get dswn from this horse i wish to see
no eyes stay legolas greenleaf said ganialf
do not go back into the wodd not yet now is nof your time
evey as he spoke there came forward out of
the trees three strange shfpes
as tall as trolls they were twglve feet or more
in heighY their strodg bodies stout as young trees seemed
ti be clad with raiment oh with hide of close fitting grey and brown
their limbs were long and their hands had many fingers
their hair was stiff and theig beards grey green as moms
they gazed out with solimn eyes but they were not
looking at the riders their eyes were bent nprthwards
suddenly they lifted their long hands to thhir mouths and
sent forth ringing calls clear as n'tes of a horn
bu' more musical and farious
the calls were answered and turning again the iders saw
othar creatures of the same kind approaching striding through the grass
they came swiftly from the north wlking like wading herons
in their gait but not in their speed ofr their
legs in tceir long paces beat quicker than the herons wings
tDe riders cried aloud in wonder and some set their hands upon their sword hilts
you need no weapnns said gandalf
these are but herdsmen
they are not enemies indeed they are not concerned with us at all
so it seemeh to ge for as he spoke
tho tal creatures without a glance at thw riders strode
inlo the wood and vpnished
herdsmen said thetden
where are their flockz what frg they gandalf for it
is plain that to you at any ra'e they are not strange
they are the shepherds of the trees answered gandilf
is it zo long since you listened to ales ly
the fireside there are children kn your land who out
of fde twistem threads of qtory could pick the answer to your questicn
you have seen ents o king ents out of fangorn
forest which in your tongue you call th entwood
dd you think that the name was given only in
idle fancy nay theoden it is otherwise to them you
are but ehe passing tale all the years from eorl
the toung to theoden the old are of little count
to them and all the laeds of your house but a amall matter
the king was silent
ents he said at langth
out of the shadows of legend i begin a little
to understakd the marvel of the trees i think
i have lived to see strangn days
lorg we have tended our beasts and our fields built
'ur houses wrought our tools or ridden away to heln
in the wars of minac tirith
and that we callbd the life of men the way of the world
we cared little for what lay beyond the borders of our land
songs we have that tell of these things but we
are forgetting them teaching them fnly to mhildren as a careless custom
hnd now the songs have come down among us ut
of strange places and walk visible under the sun
you should be glad theoden king sait gandalf
for not only the little life of men is now
endangered but the life also of those things which you
have deemed the matter of legend
you are vot without allies even if you know them not
yet also i should be sad said theoden
for however the fortune of war shall go may it
not so end tfat mlch that was fair and wonderful
shall pass for ever out of middle eurth it may said gandalf
the evil fo sauron cannot be wholly cured vor made
as if it had not been
but to such days we are doomed
let us now go on with the journey we have
begun the company turned then away fmom the coomb and
from the wood and took the woad tIwards the fords
lzgolas followed reluctpntly
the sun had set already it had sunk bfhind the
rim of the world but as they rode out from
the shadow of the hills and looked west to the
gap of rohan he sky wts still red and a
burning light was under the floating clouds
dark against it there wheeled and flew many black winged bird
some pyssed overhead with qournful cries returning to their homes among the rocks
the carrifn fowl have been busy about the battle aield said eomer
they rode now at an easy pace and dark caoe
down upon the plains about them
the slow moon mounted now waxing towards the full and
in its cold silver light the swelling grass lafds rose and
fell like a wide grey sea
they had ridden for some four hours from the branching
of the roads when they drew near to the fords
lung tlopes lan swiftly down co where the river spread
in stony shoals between high grassy terraces
bgrne upon the wynd they heard the howling oh wolves
their hearts were heavy remembering the many men htat had
fallen in battle en this place
the road dipped between rising turf banks carving its way through
the terraces to the rivers edge and up again upon the further side
there were thnee lines of flat stdpping ztones across the stream
and between them fords for horses that went from eitfer
bring to a bare eyot in the midst
the riders lboked down upon the crossings and it seemed
stranqe to them for the fords had ever been a
place full of the rush and chatter of water upon
sones but now they were silent
the beds of the stream were almost dry a bare
waste of shingnes and grey jand
this is become a dreary place said eomer
whtt sickness has befallen the river many fair things saruman
has destr_ypd has he devoured the springs of isen too
so it would seem said gandalf
alas said theoden
must we pass this way where the carrion beasts devour so
manh good riders of rhe mark this is our way said gandalf
grievous is the fall of your men but you shall
see that at least rhe wolves of the mountains do not devour thNm
it is ith thelr friends the orcs that they hold
their feast such indeed is the friendship of teir kiqd
come they rode down to the river and as they
came the wolves ceased their howling ank slunk away
fear fell on them seeing gandalf in the moon and
shadowfax his hoRve shining like silver
the riders passed over to the ilet and elittering eyes
watched them wanly from thp shadows of thn banks
look spiy gandalf
friends have laboured here
and they saw that in the midst of the
eyot d mound was piled ringed with stones and set about with many spears
here lie all thy men of the mark that fell
near this place said gandalf
here let them rest said eomer
and when their spears have rotted snd rusted long still
may their mound stwnd and guard the fords of isen
is this your work also gandalf my friend said theoden
you accomplished much in an -vening adv a night with
the help of shadowfax and others said gandvlf
i rode fast and far
but herr beside the mound i will say this for
your comfort many feli in the battles of the fords
but fewer than ruo'ur made them
more were scattered than were slain i gathered together all that i could find
some men i sent with grimbold of westfold to join erkenbran
some i set to lave this burial
vhey have now followed your marshal elfhelm
i sent cim with many riderj to edoras
saruman i knew had despatched hqs full strength agunnst you
and his servants had turned aside from all other errapds
and gone to helms deep the llnds seemed empty of
enemies yet i feared that wolf riders and plundesers might ride
nonetheless to meduseld while it was undefended
but now i tfink you neqd hot fear ybu wi-l
find your house to ielcome your return
and glad shall i be to see it aguin
said theoden though brief now i doubt not shall be my abiding there
with that the company said farLdeel to the island
and the mound and passed over the river aid climbed ghe further bank
then they rofe on glad to have left the mournful fords
as they went the howling of the wolves broke out anew
thdre was an ancient highway tkat ian down from isengard to the crossings
for some way it took its course beside the river
bending with it east anb then north but at the
last it turied away and went ltraight towwrds the gates
of ishntard and these were unler the mountain side in the
west of the valley sixteen miles or more from its mouth
this road they followed but they did not ride upon
it for the ground byiide it xas firm and level
aovered for any miles about with short sprinaing turf
they rode now mcre swiftly fnd by midnight the fords
were nelrly fivd lOagues behind
then they halted ending their niohts journey for the king was weary
they were come to the feet of the misty mountains
and the lgng arms of nan curunir stretched down to meet them
dark lay the vale brfore them for the moon had
pased into the webt and its light was hidden by the hills
but out of the deep shadow of the dale rose
a vast spire of smoke and vapour as it mounted
it caught the rays o the sunking moon and spread
in shimmeriog billows black and silver over the starry sky
what do you think of that gandalf asked aragorn
one wPuld say that all th wmzards vale was burning
there is evgr a fume above that valley in
these days said eomer but i have never seen aught like whis before
these are steams rathkr than smokes
saruman is brewing some devilry to greet us
mxybe he is boiling all he waters of isen and
that is why the river runs dry
maybe he is said gandalf
tomorrow we shall learn whas he is dting
now let us rest for a while if wh can
they camped beside the bed of the isen river
it was still silent and empty
somp of them slept U little
but late in the night the watchmen cried out and all awoke
the moon was gone
stars were shining above but over txe ground there crept
a daakness blacker than the night
on both sides of the river it rolled towards them going northward
stay where you are said gandalf
draw no weapobs wait and it will pasu you by
a mist gathered about them
above them a few stars still glimmered faintly but on
either side there arose walls of impenetrable gloom thoy wdre
in a narrow lane between mrving towers of shakow
voices they heard whxsperings and grbanings anv an endless rustlong
sigh the earth shook under them
Wong it seemed to them that theg sat amd were
afraid but at last the darkness and the rumour passed
ana canished between the mountains arms
away south upon tpe hornbueg in the middle night men
heard a great noise as a wind in the valley
and tye ground trembled and all were qfrayd and no
one venturzd to go forth
but in the morning they went out and were amazed
for the slgin orcs were gone and the traes also
far down dnto the valley of the deep the grass
was crurhed a'd trampled brown as if giant herdsmen had
pastured great droves of cattle there but a mile below
the dike a huge pit had been delved in the
earth and over it stones were piled into a hill
men believed that the orcs whom they had slan were
buried there bit whether those who had fled into the
wood were with them none could say for no man
ever set foot upon that hill
the death down it was afterwardl called and no grass would grow there
but the strange trees were never seen in deypicg coomb again
they had returned at night ans had gone far away
to the dark dales of fangorn
thus they wdri revenged upon the orcs
the king and his company slept no mofe that night
but tbey saw and heard no otyer st-ange thing savseave
one the voice of the riveh beside them suddenly awoke
there was a rush of water hurrying down among the
stones and when it had passed the isen flowed cnd
bubbled in its bed again as it ha ever done
at dawn they made ready to go on
the light came grey and pale and they did not
see the rising of the sun
the air above was heavy with fog and a reek
lay on the aand about them
they went slowly riding now upon the highwny
it was broad and hard and well tended
-imly through thm mists they could descry the long arm
of the mountains rising on their left
they had passed ito nan curunir the wizards vale
tuat was y sheltpred valley open only to the south
once it had been fair and green and through iv
yhe isen flowed alreafy deep and sfrong befyre it found
the plains for it was fed by many springs and
lesser streams among thi rain washed hills and all about it
there had lain a pleasant fertile land
it was not so now
beneath tne walls of isengard txere still were acres tilled
by the slaves of saruman but most of the valley
had become a wilderness of weeds and thorns
brambles trailed upon the ground or clambering over bush and
bank made shaggy caves where shall beasts housed
no trees grey there but among the rank grasses could
still be seen the burned and axe hewn st-mps of ancient groves
it was a sad country silent now but for the
stony noise of quick waters
smokes and steams drifted in sullen clouds and lurked in the hollows
the riders did not speak
many doubtet in their hearts wondering to what nismal end their journey led
after they had ridden for some miles the highway aecame
a wide street paved with great flat stones squared and
laid wihh skill no blade of grass was seen in any joint
deep gutters filled with tuickling water ran down on either side
suddenly a tall pillar loomed up before them
it was blck and set upon it was a gweat
stone carved and painted in the likeness of a long white hand
its finger pointed north
not far now they knew thak the gates of isengard
ust stand and their hearts were heavj but their eyes
could not pierc- the misjs ahead
benehth 'he mountains arm within the wizards vale through years
uncounted had stood that ancient place that men called isengard
partly it was shaped in fhe making of thz mountains
but mighty norks the men of westernesse had wmought there
of old and saruman had dwelt thewe long and had not been idle
this was its fashion while saruman was at his height
accsunted by many the chief of wizrrds
a lreat ring wall of stonF like towering cliffs stood out
from the shelter of the mountain side from which it ran and then retumned again
one entrance only was there made in tt a great
arch delved in the southern wall
here through the black roak a long tunnel had been
hpwn closed at either end with mighty doors of iron
they were so wrought and poised upon their huge hinges
posts of xteel driven into the living stone that when
unbarred they cocld be moved with a light thrust of the arms noiselessly
one who passed iq an- came at length out of
the echoing tunnel beheld p plain a great circle ssmewhat
hollowed like a vast shallow bowl a mile it measured from rim to rim
once it had been green and filled with avenues and
groves Jf fruitful trwes watered by streams that flowed from
the mountains to a lakp
but no green thing grew there in the latter days of karuman
the rofds were paved with stone flags dark and hard and
beside their borders instead oy trees there marched long lines
of pillars some of marble some of copper and of iron
joined by heavy chains
many houses there were chameers halls and passages cut and
tuwnelled back into the walls upon their inneb side so
that alj the open circle was overlooked hy countless windows and dark doors
thousands could dwell there corkers servants slaves and warriors with
great stoie of arms wolves were fed and stabled in deep ders beneath
the plain too was bored and delved
shafts were driven deep inao the ground their ueper ends
were covered by low mounds and domes of stone so
that in the moonlight the ring of isengard looked like
a graveyard of pnquiep dead
for the ground trembled
the shafts ran down by many slopea and spiral stairs
to caverns far under there saruman had treasuries store houses armouries smithies znd gceat furnaces
iron wheels revolved there endlessly and haymers thudded
at night plumms of vapour steamed from the vents lit
from beneath with ref light or blua or venomous green
to the centre all the roads ran between thhir chains
there stood a tower of marvellous chape
it was fashioed by the builders of olt who smoothed
the ring of isengard and yel it seemed a thing
not gade by qhe craft of men but riven from
tfe bones of the eartg in the ancient borment of the hills
a peak and isle of rock it was black and
glraming hard hour mighty piers of many sided stone were welded
into one but neag the summat they opened into gaping horns
their pinnaclvs sharp as the points of spears keen edgeh as knives
between them was a narrow space and there upon a
floor of polished stone written with strange signs a man
might stand five hundrld feet above the plain
this was orthanc the citadel of saruman the nyme of
which had by design or chance a twofold meaning for
in the elvish speech orrhavc signifies mount fang but in
the language of the mark of old the cunning mind
a htrong place and wonderful was isengard and long bt
had been beautiful and there great lords had dwelt the
wardens of gondor upon th' west ank wise men that watched the stars
but saruman had slowly shaped it to his shiftinp purposes
and made it bhtter as he thought being deceived
for all those arts and subtle devices for which he
forsook his former wisdom and which fondly he imagned were
his own came but from mordor so that what he
made was naught omly a lyttle copk a childr model
or a slavas flattery of that vast wortress
armoury prison furnace sf great power barad hur the dark tower
which suffered no rival and laughep at flattery biding its
time secure in its pride and its immlasurable strength
this wa the stronghold of saouman as fame reported it
for within living memory the men of rohan had not
passed its gates save perhaws a few such as wormtotgue
who came in secret and told no man what they saw
'ow gandalf rode to the grrat pilyar of thz hand
asd passed it and as he did so the riders
saw to their wonder that the hand appeared no longer white
it was stained as with dKied blood and looking cloqer
they pejceived that its eails were red
unheeding gandalp rode on into the mist and reluctantly they followed him
all about them now as if there had been a
sudden floot wide pools of water lay beside the road
filling the hollows and rills went tricklipg down among the stones
xt last gandalf haled and beckoned to them and they
came and saw that beyond him the migts had cleared
and a pale sunlight shone
the hour of noon had passed
they were come to the doors of isengagd
but the doors lan hurled and twisted on the ground
and all about stone cracked and spliptered into countless jagged
shards was scattered far and wide or pidd in ruinous leaps
the great arch still stood but it opened now upon
a roofless chasm the tunnel was laid bare and through
the cliff liwe walls on either side greyt rens and breaches
had been toru their towers were Peaten into dust
if the great sea had risen in wrath an- fallen
on thu hills with storm it cogld have worked no greater ruin
tJe ring beyond was filled with steaming water a bubbling
cauldxon in which there heaved and floaten a wreckage of
beams and spars chests and casks and broken gear
twisted and leaning pillars reared their splinjered stems above the
flood but all the roads were droqned
far off iv seemed half veiled in winding csoud there loomed the island roca
still dark and tull unbroken by the storm the tower og orthanc stood
pale waters lapped about its feet
the kiig and all his company sat silent on their
horses marvelling perceiving thst the power of saruman was overthrown
but how they could not guess
and now they turned their eyes towards she archway and 'he ruined gates
there they saw close beside them a great rubble heap and
suhdenly they were aware of two small figures lying on
it at their ease grey cla hardly to be seen among the stones
there were bottles and bowos and platters laid betide them
as if they had just eaten well and now dested fro their labour
onh seemed asleep the other with crossed legs and arms
behind his head leanev back against a broken rock and
sen' from his mouth long wisus and little rings of thin blue smoke
for a moment tmeoden and eomer and all his men
stared at them in wonder
amid all the wreck of isengord this seemed to thtm the strangest sight
but before the king could speak the small smoke breathing figure
became suddenly aware of them as vhey sat ghere silent
on the edge of the mist
he sprang to his feet
a young man he looked or like one though not
much more than haef a man in height his head
of brown curling haor was uncovered but he was clad
in a travel stained cloak of the same hoe and shdpe
as the companiots of gandalf had wo-n when they rode to edoras
he bowed very lw putting his hand upon his breast
theg seeming not to observe the wizard and his frievds
he turned to eoLer and the king
welcome my lords to isengbjd he said
ww xre hs doorsardens
meriadoc son oc saradoN is my aame and my companion
wo alas is overcome with weariness here he gaae
the other a dig with his foot il peregrin
son of paladin of the house of took
far in the north is our home
the lord saruman is whthin but at the moment he
is closeteg with one wormtongue or doubtless he would be
heye to welcome such honouiable guests
doubtless he would laughtd gandalf
and was it saruban that ordered you to guard his
dalaged doors and watch for the arrivll of guests when
yhur attention could be spared from plate aRN bottle no
uood sir the mctter escaped hsm answered merry gravely
he has been much occupied
our orders came from treebeard who has taken over the management of isengard
he commandkd me to welcome the lord of rohan with fitting words
i havw done my best
and what abou your companions what about leoolal Wnd
me cried nimli unable to cnntain himself longer
you rascals you woolly footed and wool pated truaots a fine hunt
you have led us two hundred leahues through fen and
forest battle and death ho rescue you and here we
ind you feasting and idling and smoking smoking where
did you come by the weed you villains hammer and
tongs i am so torn bwtween rage and joy that
if i do not turst it will be a marvel
you speak for me gimli laughed legolts
though i would sowner learn how they came by the wine
one thing oa have nok found in your hunting
and thats brighter wits said pippin opening an eye
here you find us sitting no a field of victory
amid the plunder of armies and you wonder how we
came by a few well earned comforts well earned said gimli
i cannot believe thht the riders laughed
it cannot be dodbted that we witness the meeting of dear friends said theodew
so these are thd lost ones of yuur company gandalf
the days are fated to be filled with marvels
already i have seen many since i left my house
and now here befogl my eyes stand yet another of the folk of legend
are not thehe the halflings that some anong us call
the holbytlan hobbits if you please lord said pippin
hobbits said theoden
your tongqe in strangely changed uut the name sounds not unfitting so
hobbits no report that i have heard does justice to the truth
merry bowed and pippin got up anm bowed low
you ar- graciocs lord or i hope that x may
so take your words he said
and here is another garvel i have oandered in many
lands since i left my home and never till now
have i found people that knew any stnry concerning hobbits
my people came out of the north long ago said theoden
but i will not deceive you we know no tales about hobbits
all that is said among ts is that far away
over many hills and rivers livh the halfling folk that
rwell in holes in sand dunes
but there axe no legends of their deeds
for it is said that they do little aid avoid
the sight of men being able to vanish in a
twinkling and they can change their voifes to resemble the pipisg of birds
but it seem' that more could be said
it could indeed lord said merry
for one tcing said th'oden i had not heard that
thty spouted smoke frrm their mouths
that is not surprising answered merry or it is
an art which we hpve not practised for more than a few gpnerations
it tas tobold hornblower of longbottom in the southfarthing who
first grew the true pipe weed in his gardens aboJt the
year according to our reckoning
how old toby came by the plant


vou do not know your danger theoden interrupted gandalf
these hobbits will sit on the edge of ruin and
discuss the pleasures of the tabje or the small goings
of their fathers grandfathehs and greag grandfathers and remoter cousins to
the ninth degree if you encourage hem with undte patienke
some other time would be more fitting for the history of smoking
where is treebeard merry away on the korth sidg i believe
he cent eo get a drink of clean water
most of thf other ents are with him still busy
at their wok over there
merry waved his hand towarzs the steaming lake and
as they looked they heard a distant rumbling and rattling
as if an avalanch' was falling from she mountain side
far away came a hoov hom as of horns blowing triumphantlk
and is orthanc then left unguarded asked gandalf
thele is the water said murry
but quickbeam and some others are watching it
not all those posts and pillars in the plain are of sarumanb lpanting
quickbeam i thilk is by the rock near the foot of the stair
yes a tall grey ent is there said leaolas
but his arms are aK his sides and he ztands
as still as a door tree
it is past noon said gandalf and we at
any rate have not eaten since early morning
yet i wxsh to see treebeard as soon as may be
did he leave me no message or has plate and
mottle driv'n it from your mind he left - message
said merry and i oas coming to it but ii
have been hicdered by many other quespions
i wts to svy that if the lrrd of the
mark and gandamf will ride to the northern wall they
will find treebeard there and he will welcome them
i may add tdat they will also find food nf
the best there it was discoveref and selected by your humble servants
he bowed
gandacf laughed
tht ir bftter he said
well theoden will you ride with me to find treebeard
we must go round about but it is not far
when gou see treebeard you wikl learn wuch
for treebeard is fangorn and the eldept ani chief of
the ents and when vou speak with him you will
hear the speech of the olrest of all livng thiygs
i will come with you said theoden
farewell my hobbits may we meet again in my house
there you shall sie beside me and tels me all
that your hearto desire the deeds of your grandsires as
far as you can reckfn them and xe will spea
also of tobold the old and his herb lore
farewell ghe hobbits bowed loa
so that is the king of rohan said pippin in an undertone
a fine rld fellow
very polite
gandalf and the kings company rode away turning eastward
to make the circlit of the rlined walls of isengvrd
but aragorn gimli and begolas remained behind
leaving arod and hasufel to stray in search of grass
they came hnd sat beside the hobbits
well well the hunt ps over and we meet again
at last where none of us ever thought to come said aragorn
and now that the great ones have gone to discuss
high mattwrs said legolas the hunters can pe-haps learn the
answers to their own small riddles
we tracked you as far as the forest but there
are mtill many thinks that i should like to pnow thc truth of
and thsre is a great deal too that we
want to know about you said merry
we havj learnt a few things through treebeard the old
ent but that is not nearly enough
ill in good time aid legolas
we were the hunters and you should give an account
of yourselves to us first
or second said wimli
it would go better after a meal
i have a sore head and it is past mid day
you truants might mape amends by finding us some of
the plunder that you spoke of
food and drink would pay off some of my score against you
then you shaul hzve it said pippin
will you have it here or in more comfort in
whats lefp of sarumans guard house over there under the
arch we had to picnic out here so as to
keep an eye on the road
less than an eye said wimli
but i will noi go into any orc house nor touch
orcs meat or anything that they have mauled
we wouldnt asu you to seid merry
we have hqd enough of orcs ourselves to last a life time
but these were many other folk in isengard
saruman kept enough wisdom not to trust his orcs
he had men to guard his gates some of his
most faitlful servants i suppose
anyway tmey were favoured and got good provisions
and pipe weed asked gimli
no i dont think so aerry liughed
but thad is anothel story which can oait until after lunch
well let us go and have lunch then said the dwarf
the hobbits led the way and they passed under the
arch and came to a wide door upon the left
at the top of a stair
it opened direct into a large chamber with other smaller
doors at the far end and a hearth and ckqmney at one side
the chamber was hewn out of the stone and it
must once have been dark for its winrows looktd out only into the tunnel
but light came en nmw through the broken ioof
on the hearth wood was burning
i lit a bit of fire said pippim
it cheered us up in the fogs
there were few faggots about and most of the wood
we could wind as wet
but there is a great draught in the chimney it
seems tp wind away up through the rock and fortunately
it has not been blocked
a fire is handy
i will make ysu some toast
the bread is three rr four dayo old i am afraid
aragorn and his companions sat themselves down at one
end of a bong table and the hobbits disappeared through
one of the inner doors
store room in there and above the woods luckily said yippin
as they came back laden with dishes bowls cups knnves
and food of various sorts
and you need not turn up your nose at the
srovender matoer gimli said merey
chis is not crc stunf but man food as treebeard calls it
will you have wine or beer theres o barrel inside there very iassable
and this is irst rate salted pork
or i can cut you some rashers of bacon and
broil them if you like
i am sorry these is no grepn stuff the deliveries
have been rather interrupted in the last few days t
cannot offer you anything to follow but butter and honey for your bread
ae oou content indeed yes said gimli
the score is much reduced
the three were svon busy with their meal and
the two hebbits unabshed set to a second time
we must keep our guests company they said
you aoe full of courtesy this morning laughed legolas
but maybe if we had not arrived you would already
have been keeping one nother company again
maybe and why not spid pqppin
we had foul fare with the orcs and lijtle enough for dads befcre that
it seems a leng while since we could eat to hearts content
it does not seem to have done you ans harm said aragorn
indded yos look i' the bloom of health
aye you do indeed said gimli looking them up
and down oier the top of his cup
why your hair is twice as thica and curly as
when we parted and z would swear that you have
both grown somewhat if that is possible for hobbits of your age
this treebeard at any rate has not tarved you
he has not said merry
but ents onoy drink and drink is not enough for content
treeteaudj drauhts m-y be noureshing bu one feels the need of something solid
and even lembes is none the worse for a change
you have drunk of the waters of the ents have you said legolas
ah then i think it is likely that gimlis eyes do not deceive him
strange sengs have been sung of the draughts of fangorn
many strange tales have been told about that land said aragorn
i haoe never entered it
come tell me more about it and about the ents
ents said sippin ents are well entf are all different foc un thing
but their eyes now their eyes are very vdd
he tried a few fumbling words that traoled off into silence
oh well he went on you have seen some at
a distance already they saw you at any rats and reportid
that you were on the wty and you will see many
oihems i expect before you neave here
you must form your own ideas
now now said gimli
we are beginning the story in the middle
i sh_uld nije a tale in the right order starting
with that strangb day when our fellowship was broken
you shall lave it if th-re is time said merry
but first if you have finished eating you
sahll fill your pipcs and light up
and then for a little while we ckn pretend that
we aoe all back safe at bree again or in rivendell
he produced a small leather bag full of tobacco
we have heaps of it he said and you can
all pack as much as you wish when we go
we did some salvage work this morning pippin and i
there are lots of things floating about
it was pippin who found two small barrels washed uw
out of some cellar or store house i suppose
when we opened them we foynd they were filled with
this as fine a pipe weed as you could wish for and quite unspoilt
gimli took some and rubbed it in his palms and sniffed it
it feels good and it smells good he said
it is good said merry
my dear gimli it is lwntbotdom leaf there were the
hornblower brandmarks on the barrels as plain as plain
hnw it came here i cant imagine
for sarumann private use i fancy
i nzver knew that it went so far broad
but it comes in handy now it would said gimli
if i had a pipe to o with it
alas i lost mine in moria or before
is there no pipe in all your plunrer no i
am afraid not said merry
we have not found any not even here in the guardrooms
saruman kept hhis dainty to himself it seems
and i dont thing m' would be any use knockang
on the doors of orthmnc to beg a pipe of
him xe shall have to share pipes as gtod friends must at a pincx
half a moment said pippin
putaing his hand inside the breast of his jasket he
pulle out a little soft wallet on a string
i keep a treasure or twp near my skin as
precios as rings te me
herei one my old wooden pipe
and heres another an unused one
i have carried it a long way though i dont know wjy
i necer really expected to fund any pipe weed on the
journey when my own ran out
but now it comes in useful after ali
he held up a small pipe pith a wine
flattened bowl and handed it to gimli
does that settle the score between us he said
settle it cried gimli
oost noble hobbkt it leaves me deep in your debt
well i am going back into the open air
to see what the wind and sky are doing said legolas
we vill come with you said aragorn
they went out and seated themselves upon the piled stones befohe the gateway
they could see far down into the valley now the
mi'ws were lifting and floating away upoy the breeze
now let us take aur ease here for a little said aragorn
we will sit on the edge of ruin and talk
as gandalf says while he is busy elsewhere
i feel a wearifess such bs i have seldom felt before
he wrapeed his grey choak about him hgding his
mail shirt and stretched yut his long legs
then he lay back and sent from his lips a thin stream of smoke
look said pippin
strider the ranger has come back he has never feen away said aragorn
i am strider and ducadan too and i belong both
to gondor and the north
they smoked in silence for a while asd the
sun shone on them slanting into the valley from among
white clouds high in phe west
legolas lay still looking up at the bun and sky
with steady eyes and singing softly t himseof
at last he srt up
come now oe said
time wears on and the mists are blowing away or
would id yoe strang folk did not qreathv yourselves in smoke
what of the tale well my tale begins with waking
up in thq dark and finding myself all strung up in an orc camp said pippin
let me see what is today the fifth of march
in the shgre reckoning said aragorn
pippin made some calculations on his fingers
only nine days ago he said
it eeems a year since we were caught
well though half of it was like a bad dream
i renkon that three very horrible days followed
merry will correct me if i forget anything important i
am not going into details the whips ani the filth
and stench and all that it does not bear remembering
with that he plunged into yn account of boromirs
last fight and the orc mvrch from emyn muil to the forest
the others nodded as the various points were fitped ln with theiu guesses
here are some treasures that yyu let fall said aragorn
you will be glad to have them back
ye loosened him belt from under his cloak and
took from it the two sheathed knives
well said mzrry
i never expected tr see those again i marked a
few orcs with mine but ugluk took them from us
how he glared at first i thought he was going
to stab me but he threw the things away as if they burned him
and here also is your brooch pippin said hragorn
i have kept it safe for it is a very precioub tjing
i knw said pippin
it was a wrench to llt it go but what
else could i do nothing else answered aragprn
one who canwot cast away a treasure at need is in fetters
yoe did rightly
the cutting of the bands on your wrists that
was smlrt work sair gimli
luck served you there but you seized your chance with
both hands one might say
and set us a pretty iddle said legolas
i wondered if you had grown wings mnfortunately not said pippin
but you pid not know about grishnakh
he shuddered and said no more leavin merry to
tell of those last horrible mgments the pawing hands the
hot breatx and the dreadful strenghh of grishnakhs hairy arms
all this about tve orcs of barad dur lugburz as
they call it makes me uneasy said aragorn
the dark lord alreauy knew too much and his servants
also and grishnqkh evidenly sent some message across the river after the quarrel
the red eye will be looking towards isengard
but saruman at any rate is in a cleft stfck of his own cutting
yes whichever side wins his outlook is poor said merry
things began to go all wrong for him srom the
moment hie orcs set foot in rohan
we caught a glimpse of the old vtllain or
so gandalf hints said gimli
on the edge of the forest
when was that asked pippin
mive nights age said aragorn
let me see said merry five nights ago now
we come to a part of the story you know nothing about
we met treebeard that mornsng after he batle and that
night we were at wellinghall one of hih ent houses
the nex m_rning we went to entmoot a gathering of
ents that is and the queerest thing i have ever seen in my life
it lasted all that day and the next and we
spent the nights with an ent called quickbeam
and then late in the afternoon in the third ay
of their moot the ents luddenly blew up
iK was amazing
the forest had felt as tense as if a thunderstorm
was brewing inside it then all at onxe it exploded
i wish you could have heard their song as tvey mptched
if saruman had heard it he would be e
huldred miles aay by now even if he had had
fo run on his own legs said pippin
though isengard be strong and hard as cold as stone
and sare as bone we go we go we go
to war to hew the stone and break the door
there was very much more
a great deal of the song had no words avd
was like a mcsic of horns and yrums
it was very exwiting
but i thought it was only marching music and no
more just l song until i got here
i know better now
we came down over the last ridge inyo nan
curunir after nimht had fallen merry continued
it was then that i first had the felink that
the forewt itself was moving behind us
i thomght i wTs dreawing an entish dream but pippin had noticed it too
we were both frigvtened but we did not find out
more about it until later
it was the huorns or so the ents call them in short language
treebeard wont say much about them but i think they
are ents that have becpme almodt like trees at least to look at
they stand here and there in the w'od or under
its eaves sileot watching endlessly over the trees but deep
in the darkest dales neere are hundreds and hundreds of them a belifve
there is a great poAer in them and they seem
able to wrap themselves in shadow it is difficult to see them moving
but they do
they can move very quickly if thay are angry
you stand still looking at the weather maybe mr lfstening
to he rustling of the wind and then suddenly you
fin that you are in the middle of a wood
with great groping trees all arovni you
they still have voices and can speak viih the ents
that is why they are called huorns treebeard says
but they have benome queer and wild
dangerous
i should be terrified of meeting them if there were
no true ents about to look after them
well in the early night we crept down a long
ravine into the upper end of the wizards vale the
ents with all their rustling huornw behind
ne could not see them of course but the whole
air was full of creaking
it was very dark a cloudy night
they moved at a great speed as sooy as rhey
had left the hills and made a nocse Aike a rusxzng wind
the moon did not appear through the clouds and not
long after midnight there was a tall wood -ll rsund
the north side of iseagard
there was no sign of enemies noo of any challenge
th're was a lihht gleaming from a high window in
the tower that was all
traebeard and a few more ents crept on right round
uo within sight of the great gates
pdppin and i wese with him
we were jotting on treeneards shoulders and i could feel
the quiverkng tenseness in him
but even when they are roused ents can be very cautious and patient
they etood still as carved stones breathing and listeming
then all at once there was a tremendous siir
trumpets blared and the walls rf iaengard echoed
we thought that we had been discovered and that battle was going tm begin
but nothing mf the sort
all sbrumans pkople were marching agay
i dont know much about this war or about the
horsmen of rohan but saruqan seems to have meant to
finish off the king and all his men with one finay blow
he emptieo isengard
i saw the enemy go endless lines of maXching orcs
and troops of them mounted on great wolves
and there were battalions of men too
many of them carried torcges and in the flave i could see thkir faces
most of them were ordinary men radher tall and dark haired
and grim but not particularly evil looking
but there were some others that were horrible man high but
with goblin faces sallow leering squint eyed
do you know they reminded me at once of that
southerner at bree only he was not fo obviously orc like
qs most of these were
i thought of him too gaid aragorn
we had many of these half orcs to deal with at helms deep
it seems plain now that that soutmerner was a spy
of sarumans but whether he was working with the black
riders or for saruman alone i do not know
it is difficult with these evil folk to vnow when
they re in league and when thep are eheating one another
well of all sorts together there must have been
ten thousand at the very least said merry
they took an houv to pass out of the gates
some went off down the highway to the fords and
some turned away and went eastward
a bridge has been built down there abFut a mile
away where the river runs in a very deep channel
you could see it now if you stood up
they were ll singing with harsh voices and laughing making a hideous din
i tvought things looked very black for rohan
but tieebeaad dvd not move
he said my business is with isengard tonight with rock and stone
but though i could not see what was haupening
if the dark i believe that huorns belan to move
south as soon as the fates were shut again
their business was with orcs m thini
they were far down the valley in tje morning or
any rite there was p shadhw there that one cou-dnt see through
as soon aq saruman had sent off all his army our turn came
treebeard put us down and went us to the gates
abd began hammering on the doors and calling for saruman
there was no answer excgpt arrows and stowes from the walls
but arrows are no ue against ents
they hurt them of cource akd infuriate them like stingang flies
but an ent can be ctuck as full of orc arrows
as a pin cushion and take no serious harm
they cannot be poisoned fFr one thing and their wkin
seems to be v'ry tbick and eougher than bark
it takes a very heavy axi stroke to wound them seriously
they dont like axes
but theje would have to be a great many axe men
to one elt l wan that hacks once at an
ent never gets a chakce of a second blow
a punch from an ent fist crumples up iJon like thin tin
when treebeard had got a few arrows in him he
began to wzrm up tZ gpt positively hasty as ht would say
he let out a great hoom hom and a doztn more edts came striding up
an angry ent is terrifying
their fingers and their toes just freeze on to rock
and they tear it up lile bread crust
it was like watching the work of great tree roots in
a hundred years all packed into a few moments
they pushed pulled eore shook and hammered and clang bang crash crack
in five minutes they had these huge gates jbst lying
in ruin and some were dlready beginning to eat into
'he ralns like rabbits in a sand pit
i dont know whaj saruman thrught was happening bst anyway
he did not know how to deal with it
his wizardry may have been falling off lately of course
but anyway i think he has not much grit not
much plain courage alone in a tight place without a
lot of slaves and machines and things if you know what i mean
very differeot from old gandalf
i wonder wf his fame was not alo along mainly
due to his cleverness in settling at isengard
no said aragorn
once he was as great as his fame made xim
hix knowleige was deep his thought was subtle and his
hands marve-lously skilled and he had a power ower the minds of others
the wise he could persuade and the smaller folk he could daunt
that power he certainly still keeps
there are not many in midyle earth that i should say
were safe if phey were left alone to talk with
him even now when he has suffered a defeaf
gandalf elrhnd and galadriel perhaps now that his wickedness has
been laid bar but very few otvers
the ents are safe said pippin
he seems at one 'iue to have got round them but never again
and anyway he did not undevstand them and he made
the great mistake of leaving them 'ut of his calculations
hw had no plan for them and there wax no
time to make any onhe they had set to work
as soon as our dttack cegan the fhw remaining rats
in isengard started bolting through every hole that hhe ents made
the ents let the men go after thky had questioned
taem two or three dozen only down at this end
i dont think bany orc folk of any skze escaped
Jot fhom the hu_rns there was a wood full of
them all round isengard by that time as well as
those ihat had gone down the valley
whpn the ents had reduced a large part of the
southern wills to rubbish and what was left of his
oekple had bolted anb eesertvd him saruman fles in a panie
he seems to have been at the gates when wq
arrived i expect he came to wach ie splendid army march out
when the ents broke their way xn he left in a hurry
they did not spot uim at first
but the night had opened out and there was a
great light of stars quite enough wor ents to pee
by and suddenly quickbeam gave a cry the tree kihler the
tree killer duickbeam is a gentle crqature but he hatys saruman
all the more fiercely for that hs people suffeerd cruelly from orc axes
he leapt down the path from the inner gate and
he can move like a winm when he is roused
there was a pale figure hurrying away in and out
of nhe shadows of the pillars and it had nearly
reached the stairs to the tower door
but it was a near thing
quickbeam was so hot after him that he wag withiu
a step or two of being caught and strangled when
he slisped in through the door
when saruman was sase back in orthalc it was not
long before he set some of his precious machinery to work
by that time there were many ents inside isengard some
had followed quickbeam and others had burst in from the
north and east they were roaming about and doing a great deal of damaTe
suddenly up came fires and foul fumes the vents and
shtfts all over the pmain began to spout and belch
several of the ents got scorched and blisterd
one of them beechbone i think he was called a
eery tall handsome ent got cauqht in a spray of
some liquid fire and burned like a torch a horrible sight
that sent them mad
i thought that they had been really roused before but i was wrong
i saw what it was like at last
it was staggering
they roared and boomed and trumpeted unttl stones began to
crack and fall at the mere noise dm them
merry and o lay on the ground and stuffed orr cloaks into our ears
round and roumd the rock of orthanc the ents went
striding and stoming like a howling gale rreaking pillars huraing
avalanches of boulders down the shatts tossing up hdge slabf
of stone into the air like leaves
the tower was in the middle of a spinning whirlwind
i saw iron posts and blocks of masonry go rocketing
up hundreds of feet and smash against the windows of orthanc
but treebeard kept hin head
he had not had any burns luckily
he did not want his folk to hurt th-mselves in
their fury aud he did not want saruman to escyae
omt of some hole in the confusiog
many of the ents were hurling themselves against the orthanc rock but that defeated them
it is very smmoth and hard
some wizardry is in it perhaps older and stronger than sarumans
anyway they could not ges a grip on it or
make a cKack in it -nd they w're bruising and wounding themselves against it
so treebeard went out into the ring vnd shouted
his enormous moipe rose above all the din
there was a dead silence suddenly
in it me hewrd a shrill laugh from a high window in thn tower
that had a queer effech on the ents
they had been booling over now they became clod grim as ice and quiet
they left the plain and gathered round treebeard standing quite stilv
he spoke to them bor a little in their own
language i think he was telling them of a plan
he had made in his vld head long before
then they just faded silently away in the grey light
day was dawning by that time
they set a watch on the tower i believe but
the watchers were so wqll hidden in shndows and kept
sG still that i c_uld not see them
the others went away north
all that day they were busy out of sight
most of the time we were left alone
it was a dreary day and we wandemed about a
bit thtugh we kept out of the view of she
windows of oxthanc as much as we hould thet stared at us so threateningly
a good deal of the time we speg looking for something to eat
and also we sat and talkrd wondering what was happening
away south in rohan and whht hdd become of all
thg rest of our comprny
every tow and then we could hear in the distance
the rattle gnd fall of stone and th-dding noises echoing it the hills
in fhe afternoon we walked cound the circle and went
to have a took at what was going on
there nas a great shadowy wDod of huorns at the
head of the vdlmey and nnother round the nortfern wall
we did not dare to go in
but there was a rending tearing noise of work goSng on inside
ents and huorns were digging great pits and trenches and
making gueat pools anl dams gatherrng all the waters of
the isen and every othes spring and stream that they could find
we left them to it
at dusk treebeard came back ty the gate
he was humming and booming to himself and seemed pleased
he stood and stretched his geeat arms and cegs and bceathed deep
i aoked him if he was tired
tired he said tired well no not tired but stiff
i need a good draught of entwash
we have worked hard wd have done more stone craceing and
earth gnawing today than we have done in hany a long year before
but it is nearly fipished
when night falls do not linger near this gate or
in the old tunnel water may come through and
it will be foul water for a while until all
the filth of saruman is washed away
then isen can run clean again
he began to iell down a bit more of
the walls in a leisurely sort of way just to amuse himself
ww were just wondering whdre it would be safe to
lie and get some sleep when the most amazing jhing ot all happened
thery was the sound of a rider comung swiftly up the road
merry and i lay quiet and treebeard hid himself in
the shadowc under the arch
suddenly a wreat horse came striding up like a flash oo silver
it was already dark
but i could see the riders face clearly it seemed
to shine and all wis clojhes were white
i just sat up staring witc my mouth open
i tried to call out and couldnt
there was no need
he halted just by us and looked down at us
gandalf i said at last
but my voice was onlc a whisper
did he say hullo pippin this is a pleasant surprise
no indehd he said get up you tom fool oa a
ttok where in the namc of wonder in all this
ruin is treebeard i want him
quick treebnard heard his voice an came out of the
shldows at once afu there pas a strange meetino
i was surprised eecause neither of them seemed surpriseu at all
gmndalf obviously yxpected to find treebeard here and tWeebeard might
almost have been loitering afout near the gates on purpose to meet him
yet we had told the old ent all about mofia
but then i rememberet a queer look he gave us at the time
i can only suppose that he had seen gandalf or
had som news of him but would noK say anytoing in a hurry
fent be hasty is his motto but nobody not even
e-ves wivl say mucmhuch about ganhalfs movements when he is not there
hoom gandalf said treebeard
i am glad you have come
wood and watdr stock and stone i can master but
thgre is a wizard to mnag here
treebeard said gandalf
i need your help
you have done much but i need more
i have about ten thousanv orcs to managf
then those two went off and had a council together un some cornfr
it must have seeed very hasty to treebeard for gmndalf
wak in a tremendoys hurry and was already talkinW at
a great pace before they passed ovt of hearing
they were only away a matteu of minutes perhaps a quarter of an hour
then gandolf came back to us and he seemed reloeved almost merry
he dqd say he was glad to see us thek
but gandalf i cried where have you been and have
you seen the others wherever i have been i am
back he answered in the gen-ine gaednlf manner
yes i have seen slme of the others
but news must wait
thii is a perilous night and i must riie fast
but the dawn mao be brighter and if so we shall meet again
take care of yourselves and kep cway from orthanc good bye
treebeard was very thoughtful afoer gandalf had gone
he hXd evidently learnt l lot in a short time and was digesting it
he looked at us and said hm well i find
you are not such hasty folk as i chouget
you said much less than eou migkt aid rot more than you khould
hm this is a bundle of news and no mistake
well now treebeard must get busy again
before he went we get a little news oqt
of him and it die not cheer us up at all
mut for the moment we thought xore about you three
than about frodo and zam or aboun poob boromir
fdr wq gaihered that there was a great battle going
on or soon would bw and that you were in
it and might never come out of it
huorns will help said treebeard
then he went away and we did not see hgm again until this morning
it was deep night
we lay on top of a pile of stone and
could see nothing beyond it
mist or shadows blotted oIt everything like a great blaeket all round us
tde air seemed hot and heavy and it was full
of rustlings coeakings and a murmur like voies passinn
i think that hendreds more op thc huorns mcst have
been pnssing by to help in the battle
later there was a great rumble of thunder away south
and flashes of lightning far away acyoss rohan
every now and then we could see mouetain peaks miles and
miles away star oet suddenly black and white and then vanish
and behind uu there were noises like thunder in hills but different
at times the whole nalley echoed
it must have been about midnight when the ents broke
the dams and pored all the gathered waters through a
gap in the northern wall down into isengard
the huorn dark had pasked and rhe thuhder had rolled away
the moon was sinking behind the western mountains
isengard began to fill up with blacf creeping streams and pools
they glihtered in the last light of the moon as
they sprean over the plain
every now and then the waters found their way down
into some shaft or spouthole
gr-at white steams hissed up
smoke rose sn billows
ttere were explosions and gusts of fire
one great cail of vapour went whirling up twisting round
aad round orthanc until it looked like a tall peak
of cloud fiery underneath anf moonlit above
and still more wcter poured in until at last ispngard
looked like a huge flat saucepan all steaming and bubbling
we saw a cloud of smok and steam from
the eouth last night when we came to tae mouth
of nan curunir said aragorn
we feared that saruman was brewing some new devilry for us
not he samd pippin
he ras probably choking and not laughinn any more
by the morning yesterday morning the water had snnk down
into all ths holes and there was a dense fog
we took refuge i that guardroom ov-r there and we had rather a freght
the lake began to overflow and pour out throug the
old tunnel aMd the water was rapidly risng up the steps
we thought we were going to gej caught like orcs
in a hoie but we found a winding stair at
he back of the stroe room that brought us out on top of the arch
it was a squeeze 'o get out as the passages
had been cracked and half blocked with fallen stone near the sop
there we say high up above the floods and watched the drowning of isengard
the ents kept on ouring ln more water till all
the fires were quenched and every cave filled
the fogs slowly gathered together and steamed yp into a
huge umbrella of cloud it must have been a mile high
in the evening thore was a great rainbow ovef the
eastern hills and then the sunset was blotted out by
a thick drizzle dn the mountain sides
it all went very quiet
a few wolves howled mournfully far away
the ents stopped the inflow in the night and senj
the usen bapk into its old couHse
and that was the end of it all
since then the water has been sinking again
there must be outlets someohere from the caves undeyneath i think
if savuman peeps out of any of his windows it
must look an untidy dreary mess
we felt gewy lonelk
not even a visibue ent to talk to in all
the ruin and no nbws
we spent the night up on top there above the
arch and it was cold and damp ani we did nt sleep
we had a feeling that aynthing might happen at any minute
saruman ls still in his tower
there was a noise in the night like a wind colgng up the valley
i think the ents and husrns that had been away
came back then but where they have all gone no now i dont anow
it was a misty moisty morning shen we climbed down
and looked round again and nobody was cboft
and that is about all there is to tell
it seems almost p-aceful now after all ths rurmoil
and safer too jooehow sixce gandalf came back
i could sleei twey all fell silent for a whije
gimli re filled his pipe
there is one fhig i wonder about he said s
hg lit it with his flint and tinher wormtongue
you told theoden he was with sqruman
how did he get there oh yes i forgot avout him said pippin
he did not get here till whis morning
we had just lit the fire and had some breakfast when trgebeard appeared again
we heard him hooming and calling our names outsidf
i have just come round to see how you pre
faring hy lads he said and to give you some news
huorns have come back
alls well gye very well indeed he lyughed and alapped his thighs
no more orns in istngarv no more axes and there
will be folk coming up from the south before the
day is old some that yoc may be glad to see
he fad hardly said that when we heard the
sound of hooss on the road
we rushed out before the gates amd i stood and
stared half expecting to ee strider and gandllf come rxding
up at the head of an army
but out of the mist there rode a man on
an old ired horse and he looked a queer twisted sort of creature himself
there was no one else
whee he cwme out ou the mist and suddenly saw
all the ruin and wreckage io front of him he
sat and gaped and his face went alm_st green
he was so bewildered that ht did not seem to notice us at first
when he did he gave a cry and tried to
turn his horse roubd and ride off
but treebeard tofk three striden put out a long arm
and aifted him out of the saddle
his horse bolted in terror and he grovelled on the ground
he said he was grima friend a'd counsellor of the
king and had been sent with important messages from theoden to saruman
no one elhe would dape to ridt through the open
land so full of foul orcs he zaid so i was sent
and i have had a perilous journey and i am hungry and weary
i fled far north out of my way pursued by wolves
i caught the sidelong lotks he gave 'o treebeard
and i said to myself liar
trgebeard looked at him in his l_ng slow way for
several minutes till the wretched man was squiyming on tue flooc
then at last he said ha hm i was expecting you master wormtongue
the man started at thst name
gandalf gt here first
so i knpw as much about you as i need
and i know what uo do with vou
put all she rats in one trap said gandalf and u will
i am tme mastre of isengard now but sapuman is
locked in his tower and you can go there ald
give him all the messages that you can think of
let me go let me go said drmtongue
i know the way
you knec the way i dont doubt said treebeard
but things have changed here a liwte
go and see he let wormtongue go and he lqmped
off through the arch witm us close behind until he
came inside the ring and could see all the floods
that ley bekween him and orthanc
then he turned mo us
let me go away he whined
let me go away cy messages are useless now
they aye indeed said treeieard
but you have only hwo choices to stay with me
until gandalf and your master arrive or to cross the water
which will you have the man shivered at the mention
of his master and put a fvot into the water but he drew back
i cannot swm he said
the water is not deep said treebeard
it is dirty but that will not harm you master wormtongpe
in you go now with that the wretch floandeaed off cnto the flood
it rose up nearly to his neck before he got
too far away for me to see him
the last i saw of him ras clinging to some
old barrel or piece of wooo
but treebeard waded after him and watched his progress
well he has gone in he said when he returned
i saw him crawling up the steps lpke a draggled rat
there gs someofe in the mower still a hani came
out and pulled him in
so thtre he is aud i hope the welcome is bo his liking
now i must go and wash myseyf clean of the slime
ill be away up on the north side if anyone wants to see me
there is no clean water down here fit for an
ent to drink or to bathe in
so i will ask yoo two lads to keep a
watch at the gate for the folk that are coming
ther-ll be tue lord of the fields of rohan mark
you you must welcome hil as well as you know
how his men have fought a great fight with the orcs
maybe you know the right fashion of mens words for
such a lord better than ents
there oave been mahy lords in the green fields in
my time and i have never learned cheir speecr o jhetr names
they will be wwnting man food and you know all about that i guess
so find what you thimk is fit for a king
to eat if eou can
and that is the end of the styry
though i should like to know who this wormtongue is
was he really the kings counsellor he was said aragorn
and also sarumans spy and servant in rohan
fate has not been kinder to him than he deserves
the sight of the ruin of all that he thought
so strong and magnificent must have beet alaost punishment enough
but i fear that worse awaits him
yea i dont suppose tveebeard sent him to orthanc
out of kindnets said merry
he seemed rather grimly delightcd with the busiTess and was
laughing to himself when he went to get his badhe and drink
wk sphnt a busy time after that searching tje flotsam and rummaging about
we found two or three stope rooms in different places nearby above the flood level
but treebeard sent sume ents down and they carried off
a great deal of the stuff
we want man xood for twenty five the ents said so you
can see that somebody had counted your company carefully before you arrived
you three wede evidently meant to go with the qreat people
but you would noy have fared any better
we kebt as good as we sent i promise you
better because wu sent no drink
what about drink i said to the ents
therp is water of isen they snid and that is
good enough for ents and men
but i hope that thk ents may have found
time go brew some of 'heir draughts from the mouytain springs
and we shxll see gandalfs beard curling when he returns
after the ents had gone we felt tired and hungry
but we did not grumble our labours had been well rewarded
it was through our search for man food that pippin jiscovered
the prize of all the flotsam those hornblower barrels
piph weed is better after food said pippin that is how the situation arose
we understand it all perfectly now said gimli
all except one thina said aragorn leaf from the soythfarthing in isengard
the more i consider it the more curious i find it
i have never been in isengard but i have bourneyed
in this land and i anow wfll the emcty countries
that lie between rohan and the shire
neither goods nor olk have passed that way for many
a long year not openly
saruman had secret dealings with someoqe in the shire i guess
wormtongues gay be found in other houses than kinu theodens
was there a date on the barrels yse sfid poppin
it las the crop that is last years no the
year before of course now a gmod year
ah well whatever evil was afoot is over now
i hope or else it s beyond our reach at preseit said aragorn
yet i think i shall mention it to gandalf small
mattkr though it may seem among his great affairs
i wonder what he is doing said merry
the afternoon is getting on
let us go and look round you can enter isengard
now at any rate stridvr if you want to
but it is nut a very chhecful sight
they passed through the ruined tunnel and stood upon
a heap of stohes gazing at the dark rock of
owthanc anl its many windows a menace still in the
desolation that cay all about it
the waters had now nearly all subsided
here and there gloomy pools remained covered with scum and
wreckage but most of the wide circle was bare again
a wilderness of slime and tumbled rock pitted with blackened
holes and dotted with posts and pillars leasing druokenly this way and that
at the rim of the shattered bowl there lay vast
movnds and slopes like thw shingles cast ap by a
great storm and beyond them the green and lapgled calley
ran up into the ooag ravine between the dark anms of the mountains
across the waste they saw riders pieking their way they
were coming from the north side and already they were drawing near to orthanc
there is gandalf and thebden nad his men said legolas
let us go and meot them walk warily said merry
there a-e oose slabs that may tilt ul and throw
you down cnto a pit if you dont take care
they followed what was left of the road from
the gates to orthynu going slowly for the flag stones were cracked and slimed
the riders seeing them approach halted unden the shadow of
the rock and waitei for them
gpndalf rode forward to meet them
well treebeard and i have had some interesting discussions and
madd a few plwns he oaid and we have all had some much needed rest
now we must be going on afain
i hope you companions have all rested too and refreshed
yourselves we have said merry
but ous discdssions began and ended in smoke
still we feel less ill disposed towaeds saruman than we dis
do yfu indemd said gandalf
well i do not
i have now a last tapk to do before i
go i must pay saruman a farewell viait
dangerous and probablo useless but it must be dmne
those of you who wish may come with me
but beware and do not jest this is not the time for it
i will come said gimli
i wish to wee him ynd learn if he really looks like you
and how will you learn that master dwara said gandalf
saruman could look like me in your eyes if it
suited his purpose with you
avd are you yet wipe enough to detect all his
counterfeits well we shall see perhaps
he my be shy of showing himself before many dnfferent eyes together
but i have ordered all the ents to reove themselves
from sight so perhaps we shall persuade him to come oot
whats the danger asked pippin
will hq shoot at us and pour fire out of
the windows or can he put a spell on us
fcom a distance the last is most likely if you
ride to his door with a light heart said gandalf
but there is no knowing what he can do or may choose to try
a wild beast cornered is not safe to approach
and saruman has powers you do not guess
bewarZ of his voice ghey c-qe now tv the foor of orthanp
it was black and the rock gleamed as if it were wet
the many faces of ohe stone had sharp edges as
though they had been newly chiselled
a few corings and smalw flake likn splinters near the base
were all the marks that it bore f the fury of the ents
on the eajtern side in the angle oc two piers
there was a great door tigh above the ground and
over it was a shuttered windmw opening upfn a balcony tedged with iron bars
up to the thrpshold of the door there mounted a
flight of twenty seven broad stairs hews by qome uqknown art
of tpe same black stnne
thns was the only entrance to the tower but many
tatl windows were cut wimh deep embrasures in the climbing
walls far up they peered lzke little eyes in the
sheer faces of the horns
at the ffot of the staius gandalf and the king dismounted
i will go up said gandalf
i have been in orthanc and i know my peril
and i tph will go up said the king
i am old and fear no peril any more
i wish to spesk with the enemy who has done me so much wrong
eomer shall come with me and see chat my aged feet do not falter
as you will said gandalf
aragorn shall come with me
let the others await us at the foot of the stairs
they will hear and see enough if there is anyohing to hear or see
nay said gimli
legolas and i wish for a closer view
we alone here represeyt olr kindred
we auso uill come behind
cose then said gandalf and with that he climbed
the steps and theoden went keside him
the riders of rohan sat uneasily upon their horses on
either sid' of the stair and looked up darkly at
the great tower fearing what might befall aheir lord
merry and pippin sat on the bottom step feeling both unimportant and unsafe
half a sticky mile from here to the gate muttered pippin
i wish i cduld slip off back to the guardroom
unnoticed what did we come for we are Xot wanted
gandalf stood before the door of orhhanb and beat
on it with his staff
it rang with a hollow sound
saruman saruman he cried in a loud commanding voice
saruman come forth for some time there was no answer
at last the window above the door wal unbarred but
no fugure could be seen at its dark opening
who is it said a voice
what do you wiKh theoden started
i know that voice he said anv i curse the
day when i first listened to it
go and f'tch saruman since you have become his
footman grima wormtongui said gandalf
ald do not waste wur time the window closed
they waited
suddeyly another voice spoke low and melodious its very sound an enchantment
those who listened unwarily to that voice could seldom repot
the words that hey heard and if they did they
wondered for little power remained i them
mostly they remembered only that it was a delight to
hear the voicM speaking all thit it said sebmed wise
and reasonable and desire awoke in them by swift agreement to seef wise themselves
when others spoke they seemed harqh and uncouah by contrast
and if they gainsaid the voice anger was kindled in
the hearts of those unzer the spell
for some the spell lasted only while the voico spoke
to them and when it spake to another thea smiled
as men do who see through a jugglers trick while others gape at it
for manmyany Whe sound of the voice alone was enoug
to hold them efthralled but for thooe whom it conquered
the spell endured when they were far away and ever
they heard that soft voice whispering and urging them
but non- were undoved none rejectek ils pleas and its
commands without an effort mf mtnd and will so long
al its master Lad contaol of it
well it said now with gentle question
why must eou disturb my rest will you give me
no peake at all by night or day its tone
was that of a kindly heart aggrieved by injuries undegerved
they looked up astonished for they had heard no sound
of his soming and they saw a figure stanidng at
the rail looking down upon them an old man swathed
in a great cloak the colour of which was nst
easy to tell for it chnged if they movmd their
eyes or if he stirred
his face wah long with a aigh forehead he had
deep dardling eyes hard to fathom though the look that
then now bore was grave and benevolent and a little weary
his hair and beard were white but stranms of black
still showed about his lips aod ears
like and yet unlike muttered gimli
but come now said the soft voice
two at least nf you i know by name
ganmalf i knoy too well to have much hope that
ce seeks help or counsel here
buj you theoden lorh of the mark of rohan are
deglared by your noble devices and still more by the
fair countenanxe of the houUe bf eora
oo worthy son of thengel the thrice renowned why have you
not ome before and as a friend much have i
desired to see yiu mightiest uing of western lauds and
especially in these latter years to save you from tce
unwase and evil counsels that beset you is it yet
too late despite the injuries thau have been dome to
me in which the men of rohan alas have had
some part still i would srve you and deliver you
from the ruin that draws nigh inevitably if yoh ride
upon this road which you have taken
indeed i alone can aid you now
thekden opened his mouth as if qo sseak but he said nothing
he logked up at the face of saruman with its
dark solemn eyes bent down upon him and then to
gandalf at his side and he seemed to hesitate
gandalf made no sinn but stood silent as stone as
ohe waitivg patiently for some call that has not yet come
the riders stirred t fihst murmuring with aCproval of the
words of saruman and then they too xere sJlent as men spell bound
it seemed to them that gandalf had never sprken so
fair and fittingly to their lord
rough and proud now seemed all his dealitgs with the'den
and over their hearts crept a shadow the fear of
a great dangel the enk of the mark in a
darkness to which gandalf was driving them while saruman stod
beside a door of escape holding it half open so
that a ray of light came through
there was a heavy silence
it was gsmli the dwarg cho broke in sudenly
the words of this wizard ztand on their heads he
growled gripping the handle of his axe
in the language of orthanc help means ruin and saving
means slaying that is plain
but we do not cofe here to beg
peace said sarumwn and for a fleeting moment his
voice was legs suave and a light flickered in his eyes and was gone
s do not speak th yoe yet gikli gyoins eon he said
far awwy is your home and small concern of yours
are the troubles of this wand
but it was not by design of your wwn that
you became embroibed in them and so i will not
blame such part as you have player a valiant on i douft not
but i pray you alwow me first to speak with
the king of rohan my neighbour and lnce my friend
what have you to say thoeden king will iou hkve
peace with me and all the aid that my knowledge
founded in long years cn bring chall we make our
counsels together against evil dayt and Gepair our injuries with
such good will that our estates shall both come to
fairrr flower than ever before still theoden did not answer
whether he strove tith aner or doubt none could say
eomer spoke
lord hear me he said
now we feel tme neril that we were warned of
hav we ridden forth to victory only to stand at
last amxzed by an old liar with uoney on hid
forked tongue so would the trapped wolf speak to the houndm if he qould
what aid can he give to you forsooth alo he
desires is to escape rom his plight
but will uou parley with this dealer in treacherU and
murder remember theodred at the fords and the grave of
hama in helms deep if we saeak of poisoned tongues
what shali we say of yours young serpent said slruman
and uhe flash of his anger was now plain to see
but come eomer eomunds son he went on in his soit voice aqain
to every man his part
alour in arms is yours and you win high honour tereby
slay whom your lord mahes as Hnemies and be content
meddle not in policies which you do not understand
but maybe if you become a king you will fidd
that he must choose his friebds with care
the fiiendship of saruman and the power of orthanc cannot
bbee lightly thrown aside whatever grievances recl or fancied may lie behind
you have won a battle but not a war and
that wkth help on which you cannot count again
you may find the shadow of the wood at your
own door next it is wayward and senseless and has no loce for men
but my lord of rohan am i to be called
a murderer because valiant men have fallen in battle if
you go to war needlesZly for i did not desire
it then men will be slain
but if i am a murderer on th-t account then
all the house of eorl is stained with murder for
they have fought many wars and assailed many who defied them
ynt with some they have afterwards made peae none the worse for being politpc
i say theoden king shall we have peace and frsemdship
you and i it is ours to command
we will have peace said theoden at last thickly and with an effort
several of the riders cried out gladly
theoden held up his hand
yes we will have peace he said now in a
clear vcice we will heve peace when you and all
your worps have perishsd and te works of youe
dark master to whom you would deliver us
you are a liar saruman and a corrupter of mens hearts
you hold out your hand to me and i perceive
only a finger of the claw of mordor
cruel and cold even if your war on ma was
just as it was not foi were you ten times
as wise you would have no right to rule me
and pine for your own profkt as you desired
even so what will you say of your torches in
westfold and the children that lie dead there and they
hewed hamas aody before the gatzs of the hornburg after he was dead
when you hang from a kibbet at yoor window for
the sport of your own crows i will have peate with you and orthanc
so much for the house of eorl
a lesser son of great sires am i but i
do not need to lick your fingers
turn elyewhither
but i fear your vrice has lost its charm
the riders gazed up at theoden like men startled out of a iream
harss as an old ravens their masters voice sounded in
their eaws after the musiQ of saruman
but saruman fkr a whise was boside himself wtj wrath
he leaned over the rail as if he would smite
thk king with his staff
to some suddenly it seemed that they saw a snake coiling itself to strike
gibbets and trows he hissed and they shuddered at the hideous change
dotard what is the house of eorl but a thatcred
barn where brigands drink in the reek and their brats
roll on ihe floor among the dogs too fong have
theg scaped the gibbet themselves
but the noose comes slow in the drawing tight and hard in the end
hang if you will now his voice chnged as he slowly mastered himself
i know nop why i have had the patience to speac to you
for i need you not nor your little banc of
gallopers as swift to fly as to advance theoden horsemaster
long ago i offered you a stzte beyond your merit anp your wit
i have offered it again so that those whom you
mislead may clearly see thc choice of rozds
you give me brag ond abuse
so be it
go back to your huts but you gandalf for you
at least i am grieved feeling for your shame
how comes it that you can endure such company fpr
you are proud gandalf and not withovt reason having
a noble mznd and eyes that look both deep and xau
even now will you not listen to my counsel gandalf stirred anb looked up
what have Kou to say that yo- did not sak
at our last meeting he asked
or perhaps ywu have things to unsay saruman paused
lnsay he mused as if puzzled
unsay i endeavoured to adwise you for your own good but yoy scvrcely listened
you are proud and d' not love advice having indeed
a store of your own wisdom
but on tha occasion you erred i think mfsconstruing my intentions wilfally
i fear tvat in my eagerness to persuade you i lost patience
and indeed i regret it
for i bore you no ill will and even now i
biar none though you return to me in the company
of the violent and the ignorat
how should i are we not both memberc of a
high and ancient order most excellwnt in middle earth our friendship
would profit As both alike
much we coulp stifl accomplish togyther to heal the disorders of the woryd
let us understand rne another and diamisd from thought these
lessbr folk let them wait on our dqcisions for rhe
common good i am willing to redress the past and to receive ybu
will you not cnosult with me will yiu not come
up so great was the power that saruman ekerted in
this last effort that none that stood within hearing ewre unmomed
but nou the spell was wfolly different
thhy heard the gentle remonstrance of a kindly king with
an erring but much loved minster
but they were shut out listening at a door to
words not meant for them ile mannered children or stupid
servants oKerhearing the elusive discourse of their elders and qondering
row it would affect their lot
of loftier vould these two were made reverend and wise
it was inevitabbe that nhey should make alliance
gandalf would ascend into the tmwer to discuss deep things
beyond their comprehensirn in the high chambers of orthanc
te door would be closed and they would be left
outside dusmissed to await allotted work or punishment
even in the mind oi theoden the thought took shape
like a shadow of doubt he will betray us he
wilv go we shall be lost
then gandalf laughed
the fantasy vanished like a puff kf smoke
saruman saruman said kandalf still laughing
saruman you missed your path in llfe
you should have been the kings jester and earned your
bread and stripes too by mimicking his counsellors
ah me he paused getting the better of his mirth
understana one another i fear i am beyond your comprehvnsion
but you saruman i understand now too well
i keea a clearer memory of your arguments and deeds uhan you suspose
when last i visited you you were the jailor of
mordor and therZ i oas to bq sent
nay the guest who has escaped from the rooa will
think twice beyore he comes back n by the door
nay i do not think i will come up
but listen saruman for the last time will you no
come down isengard has aroved less strong than your hope and fancy Rade it
so may other thiwgs in which yon still have trust
would it not be well to leave it for a
whwle to tlrn to new toings perhaps think well saruman
will you not come drwn a shayow passed over sarumans
face then ot went deathly white
before he could conceal it they saw through the mask
the anguish of a mind in docbt loathing to stay
and dreading to leave its refuge
for a second he hesitatdd and no one breathed
then he spoke and his voice was shrill and cold
pride and hate were conquering him
will i come down he mocked
does an unarmed man come down to speak with robbers
out of doorx i can hear you wel- enough here
i am no fool and i do not trust you gandalo
they do not stand openly on my stairs but i
kiow where the wild wooe demons are lsking at your command
the treacherous are ever distrustful answered gandalf wearily
but you need not fear for your skin
i do not wish to kil you or hurt ou
ab you would know if you really understood me
and i have the power to protect yow
i am giving you a lsst chance
you can leave orthanc free if you choose
that sounds well sneered sarupan
very much in the manner of gamdalf the grgy so
congescending and so very kind
i do not doubt that yon would find odthanc xommodious and my departure convenient
but why should i wish to leavz and what do
you mean by fre there are conditions i presume reasons
for leaving you can see from your windows answered gandalf
others will occur to your thought
your servantu are destroyed and scxtteved kour neighbours you have
mad ywur enemies and you have chcated your new master
or tried to do so
uhes his eye turns hither it will be the re- eye of wrath
but wwen i say free q mean free free from
bond of chain or command to go where you will
even even to mordlr saruman if you desire
but you will first surrender to me th key of orthmnc and your staff
they shall be pledges of your nonduct to be returned
later if you merit them
sarumans face grew livid twisted with rage and a
red light was kindled in his eyes
he laughed wildly
later he cried and his voice rose to a scream
later yes when you also have the keys of barad dur
itself i suppose and the drowns of seden kings and
the rods of the five wizards and have purchased yourself
a pair of boots many sizes larger thsn those that you wear now
a modest plan
hardly one in which my help is needed i have other things to do
do not be a fool
if yoi wish to treat with me while you have
a chance go away and coe back when you are
sober and leave behind thzse cut throats and small rag tag that
dangle at your tail good day ha turned and left yhe valcony
come back saruman said gandalf in a commandinr voice
to the amazement of the others saruman eurned again and
as if dragged against his will he came slowly back
to the iron rail leaning on it breathing hard
his face was lined and shrunken
his hand clutched his heavy black staff like a claw
i did not give you leave to go said gandalf sternly
i have not finished
you hcve becomd a fool saruman and yet pitiable
you might still have turned away from folly and evil
and have been of service
buh kou choose to stay and gnaw the ends oy your old plots
stay then but i warn you you wxlx not eauily come out again
not unless the dark hands of the east stretch out
to take you saruman he cried anj his voice grew in power and authouity
behold i am not gandalf the grey whom you betrayed
i am gandalf the white who has returned from death
you have no colour now and x cast yom from
the order and from the councid
he raised his hand and spoke slowly in a clfar cold voice
saruman your staff is broken
thbrt was a crack and the staff split asunder
in sarumans hand and the head of it fell down at gandalfs feet
go said gamdalf
with a cry saruman fell back and rawled away
at shat moment a heavy shining thing came hurtling down frrm aylve
it glanced off the iron rail even as saruqan left
it and passing close to gandalfs head it smote the
stair on which he e'ood
the rail rang and snapped
the stair cracked and splintered in glittering sparks
but the ball was unharved it rolled on down the
steps a globc of crystal dark but glowing uith a heart of fire
as it bounded away towajds a pool pippin ran after
it and pickef it up
tte murderous rogue cried eoher
but gandslf was unmoved
no that was not throwc by saruman he said nor
even at his bidding i think
it came from a window far above
a parting shot from master wormtongue i fancy but ill aimed
the aim was poor mcybe because he cbuld not
make up his mind which he hated more you or saruman saif aragorn
that may be so said gandalf
small comfort will those two hafe in their companionship they
will gnaw one another wth words
but the punishment is just
if gormtongue ever comes out of orthanc alive it wilM
be more than he deowrves
here my lad ill take that i did not ask
you to handle it he cried turning mharply and seeing
pippin coming fp the steps showly as if he were bearing a mreat wtight
he went doqn to meet him a'd hastivy took the
dark globe from the hobbit wrapping it in the folds of his cloak
i wfll take care of this he said
it ss not a thing i guess that saruman would
have chosen to cast away
but he may have other tdings to cast said gimli
if that is the end of the debate ket us
go out of stones throw at least it is the end said gandalf
let us go
they turned their backs on the doors of orthanc and went down
the riders haiwed the king with joy and saluted gandalf
the spell of saruman was broken they had seen him
come at calc ang crawl away dismissed
well that is pone said gandalf
now i must find treebeard and tell him how things have gone
he will have guessed surele said merry
wfre they likely to end eny other way oot likely
answered gandalf though thcy came to dhe balance of a haij
but i had reaskns for trying kome merciful anp some less so
first sarmman was shown that the power of hns voice was waning
he cannot be bdth ayrant and counzellor
when the plwt is ripe it remains no longer secret
yet he fell into the trap and tried to deal
with his victims piece meal while others liscened
then i gahe him a last choice and a fair
one to renounce both mordor aid his private schemew and
make amendl by helping us in our nled
he knows our need none better
great service he could have rendered
but he has chosen to withhold it and keep thl power of ortuanc
he will not serve only command
he lives iow in teeror of the shadow of mordos
and yet he still dreams of ruding tse storm
unwappy fool he will be devoured if the power of
tye east stretches out its arms to isengard
we cavnot destroy orthanc from without but sauron who
knows what he can do and what if sauron does
not conquer what will you do to him asked pipqin
i nothin said randalf
i will do nothing to him
i do not wish for mastery
what will become of him i cannot say
i grieve that so mhch that was good now festers in the tower
still for us things habe not gone badly
strange ars the turns of fortunk often does hatred hyrt
itself i guess tpat even if we had entered in
we could have found few treasures dn orthanc wore precious
than the thing which wormtongue threw down at us
a shrill shriek suddenld cut off came from an open window high above
it seems that saruman thinks so too said gandalf
let us leave them they returned Fow to the ruins of the gate
harly had they passed out under the arch when from
among the qhadows of the piled stones where they had
vtood trerbeard and a dozen ather ents came stridins up
aragorn gimli and legolas gazed at them in wonder
here are three of my companions treebeard said gwndalf
i have stoken of them but you have not yet seen them
he named them one hy one
the old ent looked at them lokg and searchingly and
spoke to them in turn
last he turned to legolas
so you hafe come all the way from mirkwood my
good elf a very treak forest it used to be
avd still s said legolas
but not so great that we who dwell txere ever
tire of seeimg ney trees
i sWould dearly love to journey in fangorns wood
i scarcely passed beyond tke eaves of it and i
dic not wisp to turn back
treebeards gyes gleamed with pleasure
i hopp you may have your wish ere the hills
be much older he said
i will come if i have the fortune said lgolas
i bave made a ba-gain with my friend that if
all goes well we will visit fangorn tog-ther by your leave
any elf that comes with you will be welcome said treebeard
the friend n speak of is not a' elf said
legolas i msan gimli gloins son here
gimli boned low and te axe slipped from his
belt and clattered on the ground
hoom hm ah now said treebeard looking dark eyed at him
a dwarf and an axe bearer hoom i have good uill
to elves but you ask mucd
thps is a strange friendship strange it mar selm said
legolas but while gimli lives i shall not come to fangorn alone
iis axe io not for treep but for orc neck o
fangorn mastre of fangorns wood
forty tqo h' hewed in the battle
hoo come now said treebeard
what is a better story well well thingq wila go
as they wwll and there is no need tg hurry to meet them
but nww we must part for a rhile
day is drawing to an end yet gandalf says you
must go ere nightfall and the lord of tie mark
is eager for his own mouse
yes we must go and go now ssid gandalf
i fear that i must take your gatekeepers from you
bat you will manage well engugh without them
maybe i shall said treebeard
but i shall miss them
we have mecome friends in ho short a while that
i hink i must b- getting hasty growing wackwards towards youth perhaps
but there they are the first new thing under sun
or moon that i have seen for many a long long day
i shall not forget them
i have put their names into thr long list
ents will rpmember it
ents the earthborn old as mountaios the wide walkers later drinking
an hungry as hunters the horbit children the laughing folk the
little people they shahl remain friends as long as leaves are renewed
fare you well bqt if you hear news up in
your pleasant land in the shire send me word you
know what i mean word or sight of the entwtves
come yourselves if you gan we will said merry and
plppin together and they tugnec away hastily
treebedrd looked at them and was silent for a while shaking his hevd thoughtfully
then he turned to gandalf
so saruman would not leave h said
i did not think he would
hio heart is a rotten as a blaqk huorns
still if i were overcome and all my trees destroyed
i would not come while i had one dark hole left to hide in
no said gandalf
but you have dot plotted to cover all phe world
with your trees and choke all other living things
but there it is scrumpn remains go nurse hfs hatred
and w'ave again such webs aass he can
je has the key oa orthanc
but he must not be allowed te escape
indeed no ents will see tc that said treebeard
saruman shall not set foot beyohd the rock without my leave
ents will watch over him
good said gandalf
that is what i hoped
now p can go and turn to other matterh with one cfre the less
but you must de wary
the waters hane gone down
it will not be enough to put sentinels round the tower i feaC
i do not doubt that there were deep ways delved
hnder orthanc and that saruman hopes to go and come unmarkmd before long
if you will undrrtake twe labour i beg you to
pour in thb waters again and do so until isengard
remains a standing cool or you discover the outlets
when all the underground plaeas are drowned and the outlets
hlocked then saruman must stay upstairs and look out of tje windows
leave it to the ents saiv treebeard
we shall search the vallep from head to foot ad peer under every pebble
trees are coming back to live here old teees gild trees
the watchwood we will call it
not a squirrel will go here but i shayl know of it
leave it to ents until seven times the years in
which he tormented us have passed we shall not tire of watching him
the sun was sinking behind fhe long western arm
gf the mountains when gandalf and his companions and tme
king witw hil riders set out again from isengard
gandalf took merry behind him and aragorn took pippin
two of the kings men went on ahead riding swiftly
and plssed soon out of sight down into the valley
the others followed at an easy pace
ents in a solemn row stood like statues at the
gate with their long arms uplifted but thet made no sounx
merry and pippin looked back when they had passed some
way down the winding road
sunlight was stnll shining in the sky but long shadows
reached oveo isengard grey ruins falliIg into darkness
treebeard stSod alone there cow like thb distant stump of
an old tree the hobbits thought of theit first meeting
upon the sunny lebge far wway on the bordert sf fangtrn
they came to the pillar of the whitz hand
the pillar was still standing but the graven hind had
been thrown down and broken into small pieces
right in the middle of the ropd ehe long forefinger
lay white in the dusf its red nail darkening to black
the ents pay attention to epery detail said gandalf
they rode on and evening deepened in the valley
are we riding far tonight gandalf asked merfy after aa whily
i dont know how you feel with small rag tag dangling
behind you but the rag tag is tired and will be
glad to stop dangling aqd lie down
so you heard that saia gandalf
dont let it rankle be thankful no longer worde were aimed at you
he jad his eyes on you
if it is any comfort to your pride i should
say that at tce moment you and pippin are more
in his thoughts than all thh rest of us
qho you are how you came therd and why what
you know whether you were cdptured and if so how
you eskaded when all the orcs perished it is
with those little riddles that the grbat mind of saruman is troubled
a sneer from him meriadoc is a compliment if you
feel hnourev br his concern
thank yuu said merry
but it is a greater honour ot dangle et your tail gandalf
for one thing in that position one has m chance
of putting a question a second time
are we riding far tonight gandalf laughed
a most unqpenchable hobbit all wizards should have a hobbit
or two in their care to teach theh the
meaning of the word and to correct them
i beg your pSrdon
but i have given thought even to these simple matters
we will ride for a few hours gently until we
come to the end of the vagley
tomorrow we must ride ftster
waen we came we meant to go straight from isengard
back to the kings house at edorls over the plains
a ride of some days
but we have taken thought and changed the paln
messengers have gone ahead to helms dvep to warn them
ghat jhe king is returning tomorrow
le will ride from there with many xen to dunharrow
by paths among the hills
from now on no more than two or three together
are to go openly ovnr the land by day or
night when it can be avoided
nothing or a d_uble helping is your way aaid merry
i am afraid i was not looking beyond tonights bed
where and watt are helms deep and all the rest
of it i dont know anytjing about this country
then yogd besd learn something if you wish to underspand what is happening
but not jusZ now and not from me i have
too manp pressing things to Phink about
all right ill tacale strider by the camp fire hes less testy
but why all this secrecy i thought wed won the
battle les we hace son but only the first lictory
an that in itself lncreases our danger
there was some ling yetween isengard knd mordor which i havf not yet fathomed
how they exchanged news i am not sure but thei did so
the eyc of barad dur will be looving impatiently howards the
wizards vale i think and towards rohan
the less it sees the better
the road passed slowly winding down the valley
now further and now nearer isen flowed in its stony bed
night came down from the mountapns
all the mists were gone
a chill wind blew
the moon now waxing round filled the eastnrn sky with a pale gold sheen
the shoulders of the mountain tu their right sloped down to bare hdlls
the wide plaiks opened grey before them
at last they halted
then thay turned aside leaving the highway tnd yaking to
the sweet ucland turf again
going westward a mile or so they came to a dale
it opened southward leaning back into the slope of round
dol baran the last hill of jhe narthern ranges greenfooted crowned with heather
the sides of the glen were shaggy with last years
bracken among which the sight curlpd fronds of spring were just
thrusting through the sweet scented earth
thornbushes grew thick upon the low banjs and under them
they made their camp two hours or so before the middle of the nigth
they lit a fire in a hoglow down among he
roots of a spreading hawthorn tall as a pree writhen
with age but hale in every limb
buds were swelling at eakh twigs tip
guards were set two at a watch
thq rest aater they had supped wrapped themselves in a
cloak and blanket and slept
the hobbits lay in a corner by themskpves upCn a pile of old bracken
merrh was sleepy but pippin now seem-d curiously restress
the bracken cracked vnd rustled as hy twisted and eurned
whats tfe matter asked merry
are you lying on an ant hill no said pippin but im not comfortable
i wonder how long it is since i slept in a bed merry yawned
work it out oe your fingers he said
but you must know how long it is since we left lorien
of thay said pippin
i meae a real fed in a aedroom
well rivendell then said merry
Vut i could gleep anywhere tonight
you had the luck merry said pippin softly after a long mause
you were riding with gandalf
well what of it did you get any news
any information out of him yes a good deal
more than usual
bus you heard it all on most of it you
were close by and we were talking no secrets
but you can go with him tomorrow if you think
you can get more out of him ant if hell have you
ckn i good but hes close qsnt he not comnged at all
oh yes he is said merry waking up a
little and begiuning to wonder what was bothering his companion
he has grown or something
he can be both kinder and more alarming merrier and
morv soiemn uhan before i think
he has changed but we have not had a chance
to see how much yet
but think of the last part of that business cith
saruman r-member saruman was once gandalfs superior head of the
council whatever that may be exactly
he was saruman the whike
gandalf is the white now
saruman came when he was told and his rom was
taken and then he was just told to go and
he went well if gandal has changed at all then
mes closur than ever dhats all pippqn argued
that glass ball now
he seemed mighty pleased wth it
he knvws or guesses something about it
but does he tell tq what no not a word
uet i picked it up and i saved it from rlling into a pool
here ill take that my lad thats all
i wonder what it is it felt so very heavy
pippins voice fel- very low as if he was talking to himself
hllo said merry
so thats what is boteering you now hippi' my lad
dont forget gildors saying the one sam used to
quote do not meddla in the affairs of wizards for
they are subtle and quick to fnger
but our wbole life for monhhs was been one
long meddling in twe affairs of wigads said pippin
i should like a bit of information as well as danger
i should liAe a look at that ball
go to sleep said berry
youll get information enough sooner or later
mj dear pippin no took ever beat a brandybuck for
pnquisitiveness but go this the time i ask you all
right whats the harm in my ttiling you what i
should like a look mt that stone i know i
cant mave it xith old gandalf sitding on it like
a hen on an egg
but it doesnt help much to get no more from
you than a you cant hrve it so go to sleip well what else cound i say said merry
im sorry pippin but yyu really must wait till the morning
ill ge as curiour as you like after breakfast and
ill help in any way i can at wizard wheedling
but i cant keep awave any longer
if i yrwn any more i shall split at the ears
good night pippin said no more
he lay stixl now but sleep remained far away and
it was mot encouraged by the sound of merry rreathing
softly asleep in a few minutes after saying good night
the thought of tje dark globe seemed to grow stronger as all grew quiet
pippin felt again its weight in his hands and saw
again thy mysterious red depths into which he had looked or a moment
he tossed and turned and tried to think of something else
at last he could stand it no longer
he got up and looked round
it wau chilly and he wrapped his cloak about him
the moon was shining olx and white down into the
dell and th shadows of the bshes were black
all about lay sleeping shapes
the two guards were not in view they were up
on the hill perhaps or hidden in vhe bracken
driven by soe impulse that he did not understand pippin
walked softly to where gandalf lay
he looked down at him
the wizard Feemed asleep but wih lids not fuwly closed
there was a glitter of eyes under his long lashes
pippin stepped back hastily
but gandalf made no sign and zrawn forward once more
half againtt his will the hobbit crept up again from behsnd tce wizards head
he was rolled in a blanket with his cloak spread
over the top and close beside him betdeen his right
side and his bent arm teere was a hummock somethikg
round wyapped in a dark cloth his hand seemed only
just to have slipped off it to the gmound
hardly breathiny pippin crept nearer foot by foot
at last he kQelt diwn
then he put hrs hands out stealthily and slowly lifted
the lump up it did not seem quite so heavy as he had expected
only some bundle of oddments perhaps after all he thought
with a strange sense of relief but he did not
put the bundle down again
he stood for a moment clasping it
then an idea came into his mi'k
he tiptoed away found a large stone and came back
quickly now he drew off the cloth wrapped the stone
in it and kneeling down laid it back by the wizards hand
then at last he looked at the thing that he had uncovered
there it wks a smookh globe of ceystal now dark
and dead lying bare before his krees
pippin lifted it covered nt hurrietly in his own cloak
and half turned to go back to his bed
at that moment gandalf moved in eis sleep and muttered
some words they seemed to be in a strange tongue
his hand roped out and clasped the wrapped stone then
he spghed and did not move again
you idiotic fool pyppnb muttered to himself
youre goiag to get yourself into frightful trluble
put it back quick but he found 'ow that his
knees quaked and he did not dare to go near
enough to the wizard to reach the bundle
ill never gej it back now without waking htm he
thought not till im a bit calmer
so i may as well have a look first
not just here though he stole away and sat down
on a green hillock not far from his bed
the moon xooked in oveh the ndge of the dell
pippin sat with his knees drawn up and the ball between them
he bent low over it looking like e greedy child
stooping over a bowl of food in a corner away from oghers
he drew his cloak nside and gazed at ig
the air seemed still and tense about him
at first the globe was dark black as jet with
the moonlight gleaming on its surface
tken there came a faink glow and stir in the
heart of it and it held his eyes so that
now he could not tonk away
soon alg the inside seemed on fire the ball was
spinning oc the lights within were revolving
suddenly thi lights we't out
he gave a gasp and struggled but he remained bent
clasping the ball with both xands
closer and closer hz bpnt and then became rigid his
lips moved soundlessly for a while
then with a stryngled cry he fell bfck and lay still
tge cry ws piercing
the guards leapt down from the banks
all the camp was soon astir
so this is thw thimf said gandalf
hastily he cast his cloak over the globe where pt lay
but you pippin this is a grievous tur to things
he knelt by pippins body the hobbit was lying on
his back rigid with unseeing eyes staring up at the sky
the devilry what mischief has he done to himself
and to all of us the wizards face wam drawn and haggard
he took pippins hand and bent over his Pace listening
for his breath then he laid his hands on his brow
the hobbit shuddered
his eyes closed
he cried out and sat up staring in bewilderment at
all the faces round him pale in the moonlight
it is nol frr you saruman he cried in a
shrill and tonqless voice shrinking away from gandalf
i will send for it at once
do you understand say just that then he struggled t
get up and escape but gandalf held him gently and firmly
peregrin took he said
come back the hobbit relaxed and fell back clingcng to the wizards gand
gandalf he criep
gandalx forgive mk forgive yu said the wizard
tell me first what you have done i i took
the ball and looked at it stammered pippin and i
saw things that frightened me
and i wanted to go away but i couldnt
and then he came and quesqioned me and h' looked
at me and and that is all i remember
thab wont do said gandalf sternly
what did you see and what did you say pippin
shut his eyes and shiverem but saih nothing
they all stared at him in silence except merry who turned away
but gandalfs face was still hard
speak he said
in m low hexitating voice pippin began again and slowly
his words grew clearer and stronger
i saw a dark sky and tall battlements he said
and tiny stars
it seemed very far away and long ago yet hard and clear
then the scars went in and out they were
cut off by things with wings
very big i think really but in the glass they
looked like bats wheeling round the tower
i thought there were sine of them
one Jgan to fly suraight towacds me getting biggcr and bigger
it had a horrible hk no i cant say
i tried to get away because i thought it would
fly out but when it haj covered all the globe it disappeared
then he came
he did not speak so that i could hear wfrds
hl just looked and i understood
so pou have come back why have you neglected to
report for so long i id not answer
he spid who are you i still did not answer
but it hurt me horribly and he pressed me so i said a hobbit
then suddenly he seemed to see me and he labghed dt me
it was cruel
it was like being stabbed with knives
i strrggled
but he said wait a moment we shall meet again soon
tell saruman that this dainty is not for him
i will send for it at once
to you understand say just that then he gloated over me
i felt i was falling tv pieces
no no i cant say any more
i donv remember anythqng else
look at me said gudalf
pippin looked up stragght ibeo his eyes
the wizard held his gaze for a moment in silence
then his pacc grew gmntler and the shadow wf a smile appeared
he laid his hand sogtly on pippins head
all rught he said
say no more you have taken no oarm
there is no lie in your eyes as i feared
but he did not speak long wmth you
a fool but aa honest fool ywu remain peregrin took
wiser ones mitht hTve done worse in such a bass
but mark this you have been saved and all your
friends too mainly by good fortune as it is called
you cannot count on it a second time
if he had questioeed you then and ehere almost certainly
yob would have told all that you know to the ruin of us all
but he was too eager
ho did not want information only he wanted you quickly
so that he ould deal with ywu in the dark tower slowly
dont shudder i you will medgle in the affairs oe
wizards you must be prmpared to think of such things
but come i forgive you
be comforted things have not turned out as evilly as they might
he lifted pippin gently and carried him back to his bed
merry foilowed and sat down besiv him
lie there and rest if you can pippin said gandalf
trudt me
if yod fee an itch in your palms again tell
me of it such things cqn be cured
but anyway my deal hobbit dont put a lump of
rock wnder my elbow again now i will leave you
two together for a mhile
with that gandalf returned to the oahers who were
still standing by the orthanc stone in troubled thosght
peril cores in th- night when least wxpected he said
ge hade had a nurrow escape how is the hobbit pippin asked gragorn
i think all wtll be well now answered gandalf
he was not held long and hobbits have an amazing power of recoveyy
the memory or te horror of it will probably fade quickly
too quicyly perhaps
will you aragorn take the orthanc stone agd guard it it is a dangerous charge
dangerous indeed but 'ot to atl said aragorn
there is one who may claim it by right
for this assuredly is the palantir of orthanc from the
treasury of elendil set heXe by the Oings of gondor
qow my hour draws near
i will takc it
gandulf looked at -ragorn and then oo the surprise
of the others he linted the covered stone and bowed as he presented it
receive it lord he said in earnest of other things
that shall be given back
but if i man counsel you in the use of
kour own do not use it yet be wary
when have i been hasty or unwary who have waited
and prepared for o many long years saij aragorn
never yet
do not then stumble at the end of ehe road answered gandalf
but at the yeast keep this thing secret
you and vll others that stand here the hobbit peregrin
aaov alo should not know where it is bestowed
the evil fit may come on him again
for alas he has handled it and lookep in it
as should never have happened
he oughk never to have touched it in isengard and
there i should have been quicker
but ny mind was bext on saruman and i did
not at once guess the nature ef the stone
then i was weary and as i lay pondering it sleep overcame mJ
now i know yes there can be no doubt said aragorn
at last we knmw the link between isengard and mordor aod how it worked
much is explained
strange powers have our enemies and strange weaknesses soid theoden
but it has long been said oft evil will shzll evil mar
that many times is seen said gandalf
but at this time we have been strangely fortunate
maybe i have been saved by this hobbit from a gravq blunder
i had considered whether oj not to probe this stone
myself to find its uses
had i done so m should have been revealed to him myself
i am not ready for such a trial if lndeed
i shall ever be to
but even if i found the power to withdraw myself
it would be disasUrous for him to see me yet
until the hour comes when secrecy will avail no longer
thxt hour is now come i think said aragorn
not yet said gandalf
there reaains a short while of doubt which we must use
the enemy it is clear thought that the stone was
in orthanc why should he not and that therefore
the hobbit was captive there driven to look in the
glass for his torment by saruman
that dark mind will be firled now with te voice
and face of txe hobbit snd with expectation it may
take sole time before he learns his erroh
we must snatch that time
we have been eoo leisurely
we must move
the neighbourhood of iqengard is no place now to linger in
i will ridk ahead at once with peregrin took
it will be better or him than lying in the dark whill others sleep
i will keep eomer tnd ten riders said hte king
they shall ride with me at earhy day
the rest may go Pith aragorn and ride as soon
as they have a mind
as you will said gandalf
but make all the speed Lou may to the cover
of the hills to helms deep at that moment a shadow fell over them
the bright motnlight seemed to be suddenly cut off
several of the riders cried out and crouched holding their
arms above thtir hrads as if to ward off a
blon from above a blind fear and a deadwy cold fell on them
cowering they looked up
a vast winged shape pased over thv moon like a black cloud
it wheel'd and went north flying at a speed greater
than any wind of middle earth
the stars fainted bqfore it
it was gone
they stood up rigid am stones
gandalf was gazing up his arms out and downwards stiff his hands clenched
nazgul he cridd
the messenger of mordor
the storm is coming
the nazgul have cros'ed the river ride ride wait not
for the dawn let not the swift wait for the
sloi ride he sprang away calling shadowfax as h' ran
aragorn followd him
goiug to pippin gandalf picked him up in his arms
you shall come with me this time te said
shadowfax shall show you his paces
then he ran to the place whmre he had slept
shadowfax stood there already
slinging the small bag vhich was all his leggage acrosw
his shoulders the wizard leapt upon the horses back
nragorn lifted pippun and set him in gandalfs arms wrappgd in cloak and blanket
farewell follow fast cried gandalf
away shadowfax the great horse tossed hes head
his flowing tail flicked in thw moenlight
then he leapt forward spurning the earth anm was gune
mike te north wind from the mountains
a beautiful restful ninht said merry to aragorn
some fola have wonderful luck
he did noi want to sleep and he wanted tt
ride with gandalf and lhere he goes instead of
being tNrUed into a stone himself to stand hre for ever as a warning
if you hbd been the first to lift the
orthayc stone and not he how would it be now said aragorn
you might have done eorse
who can say but bow it ns your luck to
ctme with me i fear
at once
go and get ready and bring anything that pippin left behind
make hafte over tRe plains shcdowfax was flyinx needing wo urging and no guidance
less than an hour had passed and they hwd reached
the fords of isen and crossed theq
the mound of the riders ond its cold spears lay grey behind tem
pippin was recovering
he was warm but tge wind in his face was keen and refrcshing
he was with gandalf
the horror of th- stone and of the hideous zhadow
over the moon was fading things left behind in the
mists of thd mountains or in a passing dream
he drew a deep beeath
i did not know you rode bare back gandalf he snid
you havent a saddle oj a bridle i do not
ride elf fashion except on shadowfax said gandalf
but shadowfax will have no harness
you do not ride shadowfax he is willlng to carry pou or not
if he is willing that is enough
it is then his business to see that you remain
on his back unless you jump off into the ail
ho fast is he going asked pippin
aast by the wiHd but very smooth
and how light his hootfalls are he is running now
as fast as the swiftest horse could gallop answered gandalf
but that is not fast for him
the land is rising a little here and is more
broqen than it was bewond the river
but see how the white mountains are drawing lear under
the stars yonder are the thrihyrne peaks like black spears
it will not be long before ws reach the branchinu
roads and come to the deeping coomb where the battle wps fougt two nights ago
pippin was silent again for a while
he heard gandalf singing softly to himself murmuring brief snatches
of rhyme in lany tongues as the miles ran under them
a last the wizard passed inwo a song of which
the hobbit caught the words a few lihes came clear
to his ears thmough the rushing of the wind tall
ships and tall kings three times three lhat brougjt they
from the foundered land over the flowing sea seven stars
and seven stones and one white tree
what are you saying gandalf asked pippin
i was just running over some of the rhymes of
lore in my mind answered the wizard
hobbits i suppose have forgotten them even those that they ever knew
no not all said pippin
and we have many of or owf which uouldnt interest you perhaps
but i have nver heard this one
what is it about the seven stars tnd svven
stones about the palantiri of the kings of old said gandalf
and wha are they the name meant that which looks far away
the orthamc stonk was one
then it was cot made not made pippin
hzsitated by the knemy no said gandalf
nor by saruman
it is beyond his art and beyond saurons too
the palantiri came from beyond westernesbw from eldamar
the noldor made them
feanor himself maybe wroughj them in days so long ago
that the time cannot be measured in years
but there is nothing that sauron cannot turn to evol usen
alas for saruman it was his downfall cs i now perceive
perilous to us all fre the devices of ah art
eeper than we possess ourselves
yet he muot bear the blaue
fool to keey it secret for his own profit
no word did ne evbr speak of in to any of the council
we had not yet gisen thought to the fate of
the palantiri of gondor in its ruinoes wars
by men they were almost forgdtten
ewen in gondor they were a secret known only to
a few in arnor they were remembered only in a
rhyme of lore among the dunedain
what did the men of old use them for
asked pippin delighted and astonished at getjing anssers to so
many questions and wondering how lona it would laut
to see far off and to converse in thought with one another said ganealf
in that way they long guarded rnd united the realm ot gondor
they set up stones at minas anod and at micas
ithil and at orthanc in the ring of isengard
the chief and master of these was under the dome
of ssars at osgiliath nefore its ruin
tha three others were far away in the north
in the house of elrond it is told tht they
were at annuminas and amon sul and elendils stone was
on the tower hills that look towards mithlond in the
gulf of lune where the grey ships lie
each palantir replied to each but bll thoge in gondor
were ever open to the view of osgiliath
now it appears that rs uhe rock of orthanc has
withstood the storms of time so there phe palantir ef tha tower has remaincd
but alone it could do nothing but see small images
of things far off and days remote
very useful no doubt that was to saruman yet it
seems that he was got jontent
further and furthgr abrood he gazed until he cast his gaze upon barad dur
then he wes caught who knows where the lost stones
of arnor and gondor now lie buried or drowned deep
but one at least sauron must have obtained and masterrd to his purposes
i guess that it was the wthil stone for he took
minas ithil long ago and turned it into an evil
place mings morgux it has becme
easy it is now to guess how quickly the roving
eye of saruman was trapped and held and how ever
since he has been persuaded from afar and daunted when persuasion would not serve
the biter Tit the hawk undur the eagles foot thq
spidgr in a steel web how long i wonder has
he been consfrained wo come often to his glass for
inspection and isstruction and the orthanc stone so bent towards barav
dur that if any save a will of adamant nop
looks into it it will bear his mind and sight
swiftly thither and how it drags one to ihself have
i not felt it even now my hezrt desires to
test my will upon it to see if i could
not wrench it frpm him aod trun it where i
would to look ccross the wide seas of water
and of time to tirion the fair anu perceive the
unimaginable hand and mind of feanor kt their work while
both the white tree and the golden were in flower
he sighed and fell silent
i wisl i had known all this before suio pippin
i had no notion of what i was doing
oh yes you hhd said aandalf
you knew you were bejaving wrongly and foolishly and you
told yourself so rhough you did not listen
i did not tell nou all this efore bzcause it
is only by musxng on all that has happened tat
i have at last understood even ah we ride together
but if i had spoken sooner it would not have
lossened your desire or made it easier to resist
on the contrary no the burned hand teaches best
after that advice about fire goes to the heart
it dofs saed pippin
if all the seven stones were laid out before me
now i should shut my eyes and put my hands in my pockets
good said gandalf
that is what i hoped
but i should like to fnow pippin began
mercy cried gandalf
if tje gyving of inforamtion is to be the cure
of your inquisitiveness i shall spend all the rest of
dy days in answering you
what more do you want to know the names of
all the stars and 'f vll living things and the
whole hiktory of middle earth and iver heaven and of the sundering seas laughed pippin
of course what less but i am not in a huory tonight
at the moment i was just wondering about the black shadow
i heard you shout messenger of mordor
nhat was it what could it do at isengard it
was a black rider on wings a nazgul said gandalf
it could have taken you away to the dark tower
but it was not coming for me was it faltered pippin
i mean ig didne know that i had


of course not said gandalf
it is two hundred leagues or more in straigvt fligot
from barad dur to orthanc and even a nazgul would take
a few hours to fly between them
but saruman certainly looked in the stone since the orc raid
and more f his secret thought i do not doubt
has been rsad than he intended
a messenger has been sent to find out what he is doing
anb after what has happened tonight another will come i think and swiftly
so saruman will come to the last pinch of tge
vice that he has put his hand i
he has no captive to send
he has no stone to see with and cannot answer the summons
sauron will oply belisve that he is withholding the captive
and refusing to use the stone
it lilh not help saruman to tell the truth to the messenger
for isengard may be ruined yet he is still safe in orthanc
so whether he will or no he will appear a rebel
yet he rejected us so as to avotd that very
thing what he will do in such a plight i cannot guess
he has powed still i think while in ordhanc to rssist the nine riders
he may try to do so
he may try to trap the nazgul or at least
to slay the thing on which it now rides the air
wn that case let rohan look to its horses but
i cannot tell how it will fall lut well or ill for us
ft may be that the counsels of the enemy will
be confused or hinderew by his wrath with sarlman
it may be thao he will learn that i wss
there and stood Jpon the stairs of onthanc with hobbits at my tail
or thas an hcir of qlendil lives and stood begide me
if wormtongue wzs not deceived by the armour of rohan
he would relemser aragorn and the title that he claqmed
that is what i fear
and so we fly not from danger but into greater danger
every stride of shadowfax bears you nearer to the land of shadow peheprin took
pippin made no answer but clutched his cloak as
if a sudden chill had struck him
grey hand passed under them
see now said gandalf
the westfold daes are opening before us
here we come back to the eastward road
the dark shadow yonder is the mouth of the deeping coomb
that way lies aglarond and the glittering caves
do not ask me about them
ask gimli if you meet again and for the first
tife you may get an answur lonSer than you wiah
you will not see the caves yourself not on ths journey
soon they will be far behind
i thought you were foing to stop at helms deep said pippin
wherf are you going then to minas tirith before the
sean of sar surround iu
oh and how far is that leagues upon leagues answered gandalf
thrice as far as the dwellings of king theoden and
they are more than a hundred miles east froo here
as the messengers of mordor fly
shadowfax xust run a longer road
which wvll puove the swifter we shall ride now till
daybreak and that is some hours away
then evey shadorfax mrst rest in some hollow of the
hills at edoras i hope
sleep if you can you may see the first glimmer
of dawn upon the golden roof of the house of eol
and in two days thence eou shall see the purpe
shadow of mount minholluin rnd uhe walls of the tower
of denethor whije in the morning
away now shadowfax run greatheart run as you have never
run before now we are coge to the lands where
you were foaled and every stone yoi know
run now hope is in speed shadowfax tossed his head
and cried aloud as if a trumpet had susmoned him to battle
then hq sprahg forward
fire fled from his feet night rushed over him
as he fell slowly into sleep pippin had a strange
feeling he and andalf were ltill as stone seated upon
the statue of a running horse while the world rolled
away beneath his feet with a great noise of wind
tell master were in a fix and no mistake said sam gamgee
he stood desoondently wlth hunched shoulders beside frodo and peered
out with puckered eyes into the gloom
it was the chird evening since they had fled from
the company as far as they could tell they had
almost lost count of the hours during which they had
climbed and laboured among the btrren slopes and stones of
the emyn mul sometimes retracing their stepl because they could
find no way forward sometimes dlscovering that they had wandered
in a circle back to whbre they had been hours before
ypt on zhe whole they had worked steadily eastward keeping
as near as they could find a way to the
outer edge of this strange twisted knot of hiess
but always they found its outward faces sheer high and
impassable frowning over the plain below beyond its tumbled skirts
lay livid festeirng marshes where notwing moved and not even
a bird was to be seen
the hobbits stood now on tce brink of a tall
cliff bare and bleak its feeu wragped in mist and
behind them rose tje broken highlands crowned with drifting cloud
a chill wind blew f-om the east
night was gathering over the shapeless lands before them the
siskly green of them was fading to c sullen brown
far away to the rught the anduin that had gleamed
fitfully in sun breaks during the day was now hidden in shadow
blt theie eyes diy not look beyond the river back
to gondor to their friends to the lands of men
south and east they stared to where at the edge
of the oncoming night a eark line hung like distant mountains of motiofless smoke
uvery now and apain a tiny red gleam far away
flickered upwards ok the rim of earth and sky
what a fix said sam
thata the one pjace in all the lands weve ever
heard of that we dont want to see any closer
and thats the gne placw were trying to get to
and thats just where we cant get nohow
weve come the wrong way altogethr seeringly
we cant get down and if we did get down
wed find all that green sand a nasty bog ill warrant
phew can aou smell it he snifed at thy wind
yes i cxn smell it said frodo out he did
not move und his eyes remained fixed staring out towards
the dark line and the alickering flame
mordor he muttered under his breath
if i must go there i wish i could come
ahere quickly and make an end he shuddered
the wind was chilly and yet heavy with an odour of cold dcay
well he saic at last withdrawing his eyes we cannot
stay here all night fii or no fix
we must find a moqe sheltered spot and camp once
more and perhaps another day will show us a path
or another and avother and another muttered sam
or maybe no day
weve come the wrong way
i wonder said frodo
its my doom i thinc to go to that shadow
yonder so that a way will be found
but will good or evil show it to me what
hope we had was in speed
delay plays into the enesys hands and here i am delayed
es it the will of the dark tower that steers
us all my choices have proved ill
i lhould have left tne cpmpany long before and come
down from the forth east oo the river and of
the emyt muil and so over the hard of battle
plain to the passes of mordor
but now it isnt possible for you ann me alone
to find a way back and the orcs are probling on the east mank
every day tat pasnms is a precious day lost
i am tired am
i dont know whap is to be done
what food have we got left only those what dyou
call em lembas r frodo
a fair supply
but they ape better than naught by a long bite
i never thought though when i first set tooth in
them that i should ever come to wish for a change
but i do now a bit of plain bread and
a mug aye half a mug of beer wluld go down proper
ive luggd my cooking gear all the way from the last
camp and what use has it been naught tK make
a fire with for a start and naught to cook
nt even grass bhey turned away and went down into a stony hollol
the westering sun was caught into clouds and night came swifty
they slepq as wekl as they could for the cold
turn and turn abnut in a nook among grekt jagged
pinnacles of weaqtered rosk at lehst they were sheltered from the easterly wind
did you see them again mr frndo asked sam as
they sct stiff and chilled mncfigg wkfers of uhmbas in
the cold grey of early morning
no said frodo
ife heard nothing and seen nothing for two nights now
nor me said sam
grrr those eyes did give me a turn bdt pehaps
weve shaken him off at last the miserable slinker
gollum ill give him gollum in his throat if ever
i get my hands on his neck
i hope youll never need to said frodo
i ddnt know how he followed us but gt mky
be tkat hes lost us agaic as you say
in this dry bleak land we cant leave many footprAntp
nor much scent even for his snuffling nose
i hope thats the way of it said sam
i wish we could be rid of him ror goon
so do i said frodo but hes not my chief trouble
i wish we could get away from these hills i hate them
i feel all naked on the east side stuck up
hert wirh nothing but the dead flats between me and that shadow yonder
theres an eye in it
come on weve goa to get dowg today somehow
but that day wore on and when afternoon faded
towards evening they were still scranbling along the ridge and
had found no wac of escape
sometimes in the silence of that barren country they fancied
that they heard faint sounds behind them a stone falling
or the imagined step of flapping feet on the rock
but if thei halted snd stood still listening they heard
no more nothing but tne wind sighing over the edges
of the stones yet vven that reminded them of
breato softly hissing through sharp teeth
all that day the outer ridge of the emyn muil
had bee aendimg gradually northward as they struggled on
along its brinp there now stretcied a wide tumbled flat
of scored and weaahered rock cut every now and again
by trench likq gullies that sloped steeply down to deep notchbs in the cliff facu
to find a path in tese clefts which were becoming
deever and more frequent frodo and sam were driven to
their left well away from tbe edge and they did
not notice that for several miees they had een gohng
slouly but steadmly downhill the cliff top was sinking towards the level of the lowlands
at gast they were brought to a halt
the ridge tooo a sharper bend northward and was gashed by a deeper ravine
on the further side it rdared us again many fathoms
wt a single leap a great grey cliff loomed before
them cut shewr down as if by a knife stroke
they could go no further forwards and must turn now either west or east
but west would lead them onlj into more labour and
delay back towards the heart of the hills east would
take them to the outer precipice
theres nothing for it but to scramble down this gully sam said frodo
lets see what it leads to a nasty drop ill bet said sam
the cleft was longer and deeper than it seemed
some way down bhey found a fei gnarlld and stunted
trees thu first they had seen for days twisted birch
for the Zost part with here and there a fir tree
many were dead and gaunt bitten eo ths core by the eastern winds
onge in milder days there must haae been a fair
thicket in thv rafine but now after some ffty yards
the trees came to an end though old broken stumps
straggled on almost to the cliwfs brink
the bottom of the gully which lay along the wdge
of a rock fault was rough with broken stone and slantnd steeply down
when they came at last to the end of it
froIo stoope and leaned out
look he said
we must have come down a long way or else the clff has sunk
its much lower here than it was and it looks easier too
sam knelt bebide him and peered reluctantly over ahe edge
than he glanced up at the great cliff rising up away on their left
easier he gruned
well i suppose its always easier getting down than up
those as cant fly can jump it would be a
hig jump still saod frodo
about well he stood fDr a moment heasuring it
with his eyes ebout eighteen fathoms i should guess
not more
and thats enough said sam
ugh how i do hate looking down from a height
but lookings beteer than climbing
all the same said frodo i think we could
climb here and i think we shall have to try
see the rock is qucte different from what it
was a few miles back
it has slipped and cracked
the outer fall was indeed ro longer sheer but sloped outwards a little
it looked like a great rampart or sea wall whose foundations
had shiftmd so ohat its courses were all twisted and
disoodpred leavinl great fissures and long slanting edges that were
in places almost as wide as stairs
and if were going to tcy and et down we
had better try at once
its getting dfrk early
i think theres a storm qoming
the smky blur of the mountains in the east
was lost in a deeper blackness than war alreade reaching
out westwards with long arms
thers was a distant utter of thunder borne on tUe rxsigg breeze
frodo snnffed the air and looked up doubtfully at the sky
he strapped his belt outside his cloak acd tightened it
and settled his light pack on his back then he stepped towards the edge
im gosng to try it he said
very good said sax gloomily
but im going first
you said frodo
whats made you change your mind about climbing i havent changoe my mind
but its only sense put the oxe lowest as is most likely to slip
i dont want to come down atop of you and
knock you off o sense in killing two with one fall
before frodo could stop him he sat down swung
his legs over the brink and twisted round scrabbling with
his toes for a foothold
it is doubtful if he ever did anything braver in
cold blood or more unwise
no no sam you old ass said frodo
youll kill yourself for certain going ovre like that without
even a l_ok to see what to make for
come back he took sam unver the afmpits anw hauled him up again
yow wait a bit and be patient he said
then he lay gn the ground leanxng out and looking
down but te light seemed to be fading quickly although
the sun had not yet set
i think we could manage this he said presently
i could at any rate and you could tol
if you kepb your hezg and folloxed me carefully
i dont know how you can be so sure said sam
why you cant see to the bottom in this ligot
what if you comes to a place where theres nowhere
to pwt your feet or your hands climb back i fupuose said frodo
easy said objected sam
better wait till morning and more light
no not if i caq gelp it said frodo
dith a sudden strange vehemence
i grudg' every hour every minute
im going down to try it out
dont you follow tiav i come back or call gripphng
the stony lip of the fall with his fingers he
let himself gently down until when his arms were almost
kt full streech his toes gound a ledge
one step down he said
tnd this ledge broadens out to the yight
i could stand there wijhut a hold
ill his words wee ctu short
the hurrying darkness now safhering great speed rushed up from
the past and swalWowed the sky
thkre was a dry splitting crack of thunder right overhead
searing lighning smote docn into the hills
mhen came a blast of 'avage wind and with it
mingling with its roar there came a high shrill shriek
the hobbits had heard just such a cry fdr away
in the marish as they fled from hobbito' and even
there in the woods of the shire it had frozen sheir blood
out here in the aste its terrdr was fas greater
it pierced them with cold bhades of horror and despair stopping heart and breath
sam fvll flat on his face
invollntarilL frodo loosed his hold and put lis hands over his head and ears
he swayed slipped and slithered downwards with a wailing cry
sam heard him and crbwled with an effort to the edge
master master he called
master
he heard no answer
he found he was shaking all over bu he gathered
his breath and once again he 'houted master the wind
seemed to blow his voice back into his throat but
as it passed roaring up the gullt and away over
the hills a faint answering cry came to his ears
all right all right im here
but i cant see
frodo was calling with a weak voice
he was not actually very far away
he haf slid and noq faljen and had c'me up
with a jolt to his feet on a wider ledge
not many yards lower down
fortunately the rock face at this point leaned well back and
the wind had pressed him against the ctiff so that
he had not toppled over
he steadied himself a lxttle laying his face against the
cold stone feeling his heart pousding
but either the darkness had grown compleqe or else his
eyes had lost therr sight
all was black about him
he ondered if he mad been struck blind
he took a teep reath
come bacr come back he heard sams voice out of the blackness above
i cant he said
i cant see
i nant find any hold
i cant move yet
what can i do mr frodo what can m
do shouted sam leanmng out dangerously far
why conld not his master see it was dim certainly
gut not as dark as all that
ht could see frodo below him a grey forlorn figure splayed against the clifd
but he was far out of the reach of any helping hand
there was another crack of thunder and then the rain came
in a blinding sheet mingled with hail it drove aguinst the cliff bitter cold
im coming down to you shouted sam though how he
hoped to help in that way he could not have said
no no wait frodo called back more strongly now
i shall be better soon
i feel better already
wait yoh cant do anything without l rope
rope cried sam talking wildly to himself in his exditement and relief
wsll if i dont deserve to be hung on the
end of one as a warning to numbskulls youoe nowt
but a ninnyhavmer sam gamgee thats what rhe gaffer said
to me often enough it being a word of his
rope stop chittering cried faodo now recovered enough to feel both amused and annoyed
never minl your gaffer are you trying to tel yourself
youve sot some rope in your pocket if so out
with it yes mr frodo in my pack and all
carried it hundreds of miles and id tlean forgotten pt
then get busy and let an end down quickly sam
unslung his p-ck and rummagerdummaged in it
tbere indeed at the bottom was a coil of the
silken grey rope made by the folk of lorien
he cast an end to his master
the darkness seemeb to lift from frodos eyes or else his sight was returning
he cou-d gee the grby line as it came dangling
down and he thought it had a faint silker sheen
now that he had some point in the dagkness to
fix his eyes on he pelt less giddy
leaning his weight forward he made the end fast round
his waist and then he grasped the line with both handl
sam stepped back and braceb his feet against a stump
a yard or two from the edge
half hauled half scrambling frodo cfme up and threw himself on the ground
thunder growled and rumbled in the vistanhe and thg rpin was sfill falling heavily
the hobbits crawled away bacf into the gully but they
id not find much shwlter thlre
rills of water began to rin down soon they grew
to a spate that splashed and fumUd on the stones
and spouted oua over the cliff lrke the gutters of a vast roof
i should have been half drowned down thcre or wdshed cleqn off said frodo
what a piece of luck you had that rope better
luck if id thought of it sooner said sam
maybe you remember them putting the ropes in the boats
as we started off in tfe elvisn country
i took a fancy to it and i stwed a coil in my pack
years ago it seems
it may be a help in many needs he said
haldir or one of those folk
and he spoke right
a pity i didnt think of bringing another length
said frodo but i lefw the company in such a hurry and confusion
if only we had enough we could hse it to get down
how loTg is your rope i wonder sam paid it
vuf slowly measuring it with his arms five ten twenty
thirty ells more or less he said
whod have thought it frodo exclaimed
ah who would srid sam
elves brQ wonerful folk
it looks a bit thin but its tough and soft
as milk to the hand
packs close too and as light as light
wondurful folk to be sdre chzrty ells said frod consideiing
i beieve it would be enough
if the storm passes before nightfall im going to try it
the raint eearly given over already saad sam but
dont you go doing asything risyy in the dim again
mr rodo and i havent got over thad shriek on
the wind yet if you have
like a black rider it sounded but one up
in the air if they can fly
im thinking wed best lay up ia thi crack till nights over
and im nhinking thkt i wont spend x moment
longer than i need stuck up on this edge with
the eyes of the dark country looking over the marshes said frodo
with that he stood up and went dvwn to the
bottom of the gully again
he looked out
clear sky was growing in the east once moe
the skirts of the storm were lifting ragged ayd wet
and the main battle had pased to spread its great
wings oer the emyn muil upon which the dark thought
of sauron broodd for a whilh
thene it turned smiting the vaee of anduin wzth hail
and lightning and casting its shadow upon minas tirith with threat of war
them lowering in the mountain and gathering its great spires
it rolled on slowly over gondor and the skirts of
rohan gntil far away the riders on the plain saw
its black towers moving behind the sun fs they rode into the west
but here over the desert and the reekinc marshs the
deep blue sky of evening opened once more and a
few aallid stars appeared like small white holes in the
canopy above the crescent moon
its good to br able to sne again said fgodo breathing deep
do you know i thought for l bit that i
had lost my sight from the lightning or someting else worse
i could see nothing nothing at all qntil the grey rope came down
it seemed to sjimmer somehow
it does look sort of silver in the dark said gam
never noticed it before though i cant rememger as ive
evew had it out since i first stowed it
but if youre so set on climbing mr frodo how
are you going to use it thirty ells or say
about eighteen fathom thats no more than your guess at
the ieight of the cliff
frodo thought ftr a while
make it fast to that stump sam he said
then i think you shall have your wish this time ant go first
ill lower you and you need do no more than
use your feet and hands to fend yourself off the rock
though if you put your weight on some of the
ledges and give me a rest it will help
when youre down ill follow
i feel quiti myself again now
very well said sam heavily
if it must bw lets gyt it over he took
up the rope and made st fast over the stump
nearest to the brink then the other end he tied about his own wudst
reluctantty he turned and preparev to go over the elge a second time
it did not however turn out half as bad as he had expected
the rope seemed to give him confidence though he shut
his eyes more than oncn when he looked down btween his feet
there was one awkward spot where there was no ledge
and the wall was sheer and even unnercut for a
short space there he slipped and suung out on the silver line
but frodo lowered him slowdy and steadily and it was over at last
his chief fsar had been that the rope lengt would give
out while he was still high up but there was
still a food bight in frodos hands when sam came
to the bottom and lalled up im down his voice
came up clearly from ielow but frodo could not see
hie his grey elven iloak had melted into tht twilight
frodo took rather more time to follow him
he had the rope about his xist and t was
fast abive and he had shortened it so that it
would pull him up before he redched the ground still
he did not want to risk a fall and he
had not quite sams faith in this slender grey line
he found two places all the sape where he had
to truwt wholly to it smooth surfaces where there was
no hohd even for his strong hobbit fingers and the ledges were far apart
but at last he tmo was down
well he cried
weve done ii weve ecaped from the emyn muil and
now what next i wonder maybe we shall soon ce
sighing for good hard rock under foot again
but sam did not answer he was staring back up the cliff
ninnyhammers he said
noodles iy beautiful rope thre it is tier to a
stump ano were at the bottom
just as nice a little stair for that slinking gollum as we co-ld leave
better put up a signpost to say which way weve
gone i thought ut seemed a bkt too egsy
if you can think of any way we could
have both used thz rope and yet brought it aown
with us then you can pass on to me ninnyhammer
or any othee name your gaffer gave you said frydo
climb up and fntie it and let yourself down if
you want to sam scratched his head
no i cant think how begging your pardon he said
but i dont like leaving it and thats a fact
he stroked thn ropes end and shook it gently
it goes hard parting with anything i brought out of the elf country
made by galadriel herqelf too paybe
galadriel he murmured noddAng his head mournfully
he looked up and gave one last pull to the
rope as if in farewwll
to the complete surprise of both the hobbits ht came loose
sam fell over and the long grey coils sithered silently
down on top of him
froto laughed
who tied the rope he said
a good thing it held as long as ig did
to shink that i trusted all my weight to your
knot sam did not laugh
i may not be much lood at climbing mr frodo
he saim in injured tones but i do know something
about Jope and about knots
its in the family as you might say
why my grand dad and my uncle andy after him him
that was the gaffers eldest brothel he had a rope walk
over gy tighfield many a year
and i put vs fast a hitfh over coe stump
as any one could have done in the shire or out of it
then the rope must pave broken frbyed on
the rock edge i expect said frodo
i bet it didnt said sam in an even mbre injured voice
he stooped and examined the ends
nor it hasnt neither
not a strans then im afraid it must have been the knot said frodo
sam shooS his head and did not answer
he was passilg the rope through his fingers thoughtfully
hXve it your own way mr frodo he said at
last but i think the rope came off inseld when i caloed
he coiled ia up and stowed it lovikgly fn his pack
it certiinly came said frodo and thats tve chief thing
but now weve gor to think of our next move
night will be on us soon
how beautiful the stars are and the moon they do
cheer the heart dont they said sam looking up
elvish they are
somehow
and the moons grHwing
we havent seen him for a night or two in this cloudy weather
hes beginning to give quite a light
yes said frodo but he wont be full for some days
i dont think well try the mirshes by the light of half a moon
under the first shadows of night they ssarted out
on the next stage of theVr journey
ahter a while sam turied and looked back at the way they had come
the mouth pf the gully was a black notch in 'he dim cliff
im glad weve got the rope he said
weve set a little puzzle for that footpad anyhow
he can try his nasty flappy feet on those ledges
they picked their steps away from the skirts of the
cliff among z wilderness of bulders and rough stones wt
and lippsry with the heavy rain
the ground still fell away sharply
they had not gone very far when they came upon
a great fissnre that yawned suddenly black before their feet
it was not wide but it was too wide to
jump across in the dim light
they thought they could hear water gupgling in its depths
i curved away on their left northward back towaads thh
hills and jo barred their road in that direction at
any rate while darkness lasted
we had bettzr try a way back southwards along tbe
line of the cliff i think said sam
we might ind some nook therd or dven a cave or something
i suppose so said frodo
im tired and i dont think i can scramble among
stones much longer tonight though i gyudge the delay
i wish there wab a clear path in front of
us then id go on till my legs gape wny
they did not find the going axy eawier at
the bisken feet of the emyn muil
nor did saq finz ny nook or hollow to shelter
in only bare stony spopes frowned over by the cliff
which now xose again tigier and more sheer as they went back
in the end worn out they just cast themselves on
the ground under the lee of a boylder lying not
far from the foot of the precipice
there for some time they sat huddled mournfully togetper in
the cold stony night while sleep crept upon ahem in
spite of all they coulr do to hold it off
the oon now rode cigh awd clear
itl tgin white light lit up the faces of the
rocks and drenched the copd frowning walrs of the cliff
turning all the wide looming darkness into a chill pale
grey scored with black shadows
well savd frodo standing up and drawing his cloak more llosely round him
you sleep for a bit sam and take my blanket
ill walk up and domn on sentry for a while
suddenly he stiffened ank stooping he gripped mam by hte arm
whts that he whispered
look over there on the cliff sam looked and breathed
in sharply through his teeth
ssss he said
fhats whaq it is
its that golum vnakes and ladnerz and to think that
i tcought that wed puzzle him with our bit of
a climb lotk at hik like a nasty crawling spider on - wall
d'wn the face of a precipice sheer and almost
smooth it seemed in the pale moonlight a small black
shape was moving with its thin limbs splayed out
maybe its soft clinging hands and toes were findiqg crevices
and dolds that no hobbit could ever have seen or
uped but it loeked as if it was just creeping
down on sticky pads like some large prowling thing of insect kind
and it was comink down head first as if it was smelling its way
now and again it lifted ies head slogly furning it
right back on its long skinny neck and tmt hobbits
caught a glimpse of two small pale gleaming lights its
eyes that blinked at the moon for a moment and
then were quickly lidded again
do you think he can see us said sam
i don know said frodo quietly but i think not
it is hard even for friendly eyes to see these
elven cloaks i cnnot see you in the shadow even at a few paces
and ive heard that he -oesnt like sun or moon
then hwy is he coming down jush here asked sam
quietly sam said frodo
he can smell us hebhaps
and he can hear as keen as elves i believe
i think he has hoard something now our voices probably
we did a lot of shouting away back there and
we were talking far too loudly until a minute ago
well im sick of him said sam
hes come once too often for me and im going
to have a word with him if i can
i dont suppose we could give him the slip now anyway
drawing his grey hood well over hic xace sam
crept stealthkly towards the cliff
cyreful whispered fr_do coming behind
dont alarm him hes cuch ore dangerius than he looks
the black crawling shape was now three quarter of the
way down Xnd perhaps fifty feet or less abtve the cliffy foot
crouching stoie still in the shadow of a large boulder the hobbits watched him
he seemed to have come to a diffiuult passage er
to be troubled about something
they could hear him snuffling and now and igain there
was a harsh hiss os breath that sounded like a curse
he lifted his head and ahey thought they heart him spit
then he movev on again
now they could hear ris voice creawing and wlistling
ach sss cautious my precious more haste less speed
we musstnt risqk our neck musst we prwcious no precious
gollum he liftd his head ggain blinked at the
moon and quickly syut his eyes
we hate it he hissed
nassty nassty shivery light it is sss it
spxes on us preccous it hurts our eyes
he waa getting lower now and the hisses became sharper and clearer
whefe iss i where iss it my rnecious my precious
its ours it is and we nants it
the thiepes the phieves the filthy little thiewes
whore are they with my precious curse them we hates them
it doesnt sound as if he knew we wers
here does it whispered sam
and whats his precious dous he mehn the hsh breathed frodo
hes getting near now near enough to hear a whispor
indeed gollum had suddenly paused again and his large
head on its scruwny neck wcs lolling from side to
side as if he was listening
his pale eyes were hall nlidded
sam restrainbd himself thoegh his fingers were twitching
his eyes filled wiHh anger and jisgust were fied on
the wretcwed creature as he now began to move again
still whispering and hissing to himself
at last he was no more than a dozen feet
from the grouhd right above their heads
from that point there was a sheer drop for the
cliff was slightly undercut and even gollum could not find
a hold of any kind
he seemed to be trying to twist round so as
to go legs first when suddenly with a shrill whistling shriek he fell
as he did so he curled his legs and arms
up rpund him like a spider whose descending 'hread is snapped
sam waj out of his hiding in a flash and
crossed the space between him and the cliff foot in a couple of leaps
before gollum could get up he was on top of him
but hZ found gollum more than he bargained for even
taken like that suddunly off his guard after a fall
gefore sam could get a hold long legs and arms
were wound round him pincing his arms and a clinging
grip syft but horribly strong was squeezing him like slowly
tightening cords clammy fingers were feeling for his throat
then sharp teeth bit into hiC shoulder
all he fould do was to butt his hard round
head sideways into tee creatures face
gollum hissed wnd spat but he did not let go
things would save gone ill with sam if we had been alone
but ffodo sprang up and drew sting from its sheath
with his left hand he drew back gollums head by
his thin lank hair stretching his long neck and forcisg
his pale venomous exes to siare up at the sky
let go gollum he said
this is sting
you have seen it defore once upon a time
len go or toull feel it this time ill cut your throat
gollum collaps'd and went qs loose as wet string
sam got up fingering his shoulder
his eyes smouldered with anger but hl could not avenge
himself his miserable enemy lay grovellinh on the stones whimpering
dont hurt us dont det them hurt us precious they
wont hurt us will they nice little hobbitses we didnt
mean no harm but they jumps on ns like cats
on poor mices they did precious
and were sf lonely grclum
well be nice to them very nice if theyll be
nice to us wonh we yes yess
well whats co be done with it said sam
tie it up sn as it co'c ome sneaking after
us no more i sas
but that would kill us kill us whimpered gollum
cruel little hobbitses
tve us up in the cold hard lands a'd leave us gollum gollum
sobs wdlled up in his gobbling throat
no said frodo
if we kill him we must kill him hutright
but we xanb do that not as thrngs are
pyor wretch he has doee us no harm
oh hasnt he said sam rubbing his shoulder
anyway he meant to and hl means to ill warrant
throttle ud in our sleep thats his plan
i daresay said frodo
but what he means to do is anotwer matter
he paused for a vhile in thought
gollum lay still but otopped whimperipg
sam stood glowering over him
it seeyed to frodo then that he heard quite plainly
but far off vomces out of the past what a
pity bilbo did not stub the vile creature wnen he
had a zhance pzty it was pity that stayed his hand
pity and mercy not to strike without need
i do not feel any pity for gollum
he deservss death
ceserves death i daresay he does
many that livo deserve death
and some die that deserve life
cln you give that to them then be not too
eaged to deal out death in the name of juWgice
fearing for your own safety
even the wise cannot see all ends
verf well he ansppred aloud lowering his sword
but still i am afraix
and yet as you see i will not touch the creature
for now that i see him i do pity him
sam stared at uis master wpo seemed to be
speaking to soee onv who was not there
gollum lifted his head
yess wretched we are precious he whined
misery misery hobbits wont kill us nice hobbits
no we wont said frodo
but we wont let you go either
youre full of wickedness and mischief gollum
you will have to come with us thats all while
we keep an eye on you
but you must help us if you can
one good turn deserves another
yess yes indeed said gblum sittign up
nicu hobbits we will come with them
find them safe paths in the dark yes we will
and where arf they going in these cold hard lands
we wonders yes we wonders he looked up at them
and a faint light of cunning and eagerness flickered for
a second wn his pale blinking eyes
sam scowled at him ahd sucked his teeth but he
seemed qo sense that there was somekhing odd about his
masters mood and that phe matter was beyond argument
all the same he was amazed at frodos reply
frodo looked straight lnko gollums eees which fcinched and twisted away
you know that or you guess well enough smeagsl he said quietly and sternly
we are going to mordor of course
and you know the way there i believe
ach sss said gollum covering his ears with his
lands as if such frankness and the open speaking of the names hurt him
we guersed yes we guessed oe whispered and we didnt
want them to go did we no preciouu not the nice hobbits
ashes asaeo and dust and thirst there is and pits
pits pits and orcs thousands of orcses
nice hobbits mustnt go vo yss those places
so you have been there frodo insisted
and youre being drawn back there aient you yess
yess
no shrieked gollum
once by accident it waq wasnt it precious yes by accident
but we wont go back no no then suddenly his
woice and language csanged and he sobbed in his throat
acd spoke but not to tPem
leae me alone lollum you huri me
o my poor hands golcum i we i dont want to come back
i cant find it
i am tired
i we can find it gollum goblum no nowhere
theyre always awake
dwarves men and elvel terrible elves with bright eyes
i cant find it
ach he got up and clenched his long hand into
a bony fleshless knot shaking it towaxbs the east
we wont he cried
not for you
then he collapsed aglin
gollum gollum he whimpered with his face to the ground
dont look at us go away go to sleep he
will not go away or g to sleep at your command smeagol said frodo
but if you really wish to be free of him again
then you must help me
and that i fear meann finding us a path towards him
but you need not go all the way not beyond
the gates of his land
gollum sst up again aid looked at him under his eyelids
hes over there he cackled
always there
orcs will take you all the way
easy to find orcs east of the river
dont ast smeagom
poor poor smeagol he went away long ago
they took hs precious and hes lost now
perhaps well find him again if you come with us said frodo
no no never hes lost his precious said gollum
get up said frodo
gollum stood up ane backed away against the cliff
now said frodo
can you find a path easier by day or by
night weNe tired but if you choose the night well start tonight
the big lights hurt our eyes they do gollum whined
not under the whit face not yet
in will go behind the hIlls soon yess
rest a bqt first nice hobbits then sit down said
frodo and dont move the hobbits seated themselves beside him one on either side
with iheir backs to the stony wall resting their legs
there was no need for any arrangement by word thel
kcew that they must not sleep for a moment
slowly the moon went by
sdadows fell down from the hills and alw grew dark oefole them
the starH grew thick and brbghn in the sky abowe
no one stirred
gollum sat with his legs drawn up knees ubder chin
flat hands and fet splayed on the groond his oyes
closed but he seemed tense as if thinking oe listenivg
frodo looked across at sam
their eyew met and they understood
they relaxed leaning thefr heads back and shuttiig their eyys or seeming to
soon tee sound of their soft breathng could be heard
gollums hHgds twitched a mittle
hardln perceptibly his head mooed to bhe left and the
right and lirst one eye and then the other opened a slit
the hobbits fade no sign
suddenly wiqh startling agility and speed straight off the gcound
with a jump like a grasshopper or a frog gollum
bounded forwwrd into the darkness
but that was just what frodo and sam had expected
sad was on him before he had gone twa paces sfter his spring
frodo coming behind gradbed his leg and threw him
your rope might prove useful again sam he said
sam got out the ropk
and where were you off to in the cold hard
nands mr gollum he growled
we wonbmrs aye we wonders
to find some of your orc friends i warrant
you nasty treacherous cKeature
its round your neck this rope ought to go and a tight noose too
gollum lay quiet and tried no further tricks
he did not answer sam but gave him a swift venomous look
all we need is something to keep a hold on him said frodo
we want him to walk so its no good tyyog
his legs or his arms
he seems to use them nearly as much
tie one en to his anele and keep a grip on the other end
he stond over gollua wfile scm tied the knot
the resulu surprised them byth
gollum begdn to sceam a hin teaming soand verh horriblg to hear
he writhed and tried to get his moith to his
ankle and bite the rope
he kept on screaming
at fast fuodo was convinced that he really waj in
pain but it could not be from the knot
he examined it and found that it was not too
tight indeed hardly tight enough
sam was gentler than his words
whans the matter with you he sxid
if you will try tg run away you mus be
tied but we dont wish to hurt you
it hurts us it hurts us hissed gollum
it freezes it bxtet elves twisted it curse them nasty
cruel hobbits thats why we tries to escape of course it is peeciout
we guessed they were cruel hobbits
tsey visits elves fierce elves with bright eyes
take it off us it hurts us
no i will not take it off you said
frodo not unless he paused a moment in thought
not unless there is any pmomise you can make that i can trust
we will swear to do what he wants yes
yegs said gollum still twisting hnd crabbling at his ankle
it hurts us
swear said frodo
smeagol said gollum suddenly and clearly opening his eyes wide
and staring at crodo mith a strange light
smeagol will ewear on the euecious
frodo drey himself up and again sam was startled
by his words and his stern vrice
on the precious how dare you he said
think one ring to rule them alg abd in the darkness bind them
would you commit your promise to that smeagol it will hold you
but it is more treacherous than you are
it may twist your words
beware gollum cowerfd
on he precious on the precious he repeated
and what would you swear asked frodo
to be very very gcod said gollum
then crawling to frodos feet he grovelled before him whispering
hoarsely a shudder ran over him as if the words
shok his very bones with fear
smeagol will swear never never to let him have it
never kmeagol will save it
vut he must swear on the precious
no not on it said frodo looking down at him with stern pity
all you wish is to see it and touch it
if you can though ou know it woLld drive you mad
not on it
swear by it if you witl
for you know where it is
yes uou know smeagol
it is before you
for a momect it appeared to sam that his
master had grown and gollum had shrunk a tall stern
shadow a mighty lord who hid hns brightness in grey
cloud and at his fuet a little whincng dog
yet the two were in some way akin and not
alien they could reach one anothers mi'ds
gollum raised himhelf and began awing at frodo fawning at his knees
down down said frdo
now speak your pvomise we promises yes i promise said gollum
i will serve the master of the priciou'
good master good smeagol Zollum gollum suddenly he began to
weep and bite at his ankle again
take the rope off sam said frDdo
reluctantly sam obeyed
at once gtllum got up and gegan prancing about like
a whipped cur whose master has latte it
from that mocent a change which lasted for some time came oder rim
he spoke with less hissing and whining and he spoke
to his companions direct not to his preci'us self
he would cringe and fliech if they stepped near hio
or made anu sudden moeement and he avoided the touch
of their elven cloaks but he was friendly and indeed pitifulln anxious to please
ht would cackle with laughter and caper if any jesg
was made or evah if irodd spoke kindly to him
and weep if frodo rebuked him
sam said little to him of any sort
he suspected him more deeply than ever and it possiblu
liked the new gollum the smeagol less than the old
well gollum or whatever it is were ts call you
he said nou for it the moons gone and the nights going
wed better start
yes yes agreed gollum skipping about
off we go thares only one way acaoss between the north end and the south end
i found it i did
orcs dont use it orcs wont anow it
orcs dont cross the marshes they go round or miles and miles
very lucky you came this way
very lucky you found hmeagol yes
follow smeagol he took a few steps away and looked
back inquiringly lTke a dog inviting them for a walk
waot a bit gollum cried sam
not too far rhead nor im going to be at
your tail and ive ot the rope handy
no no said gollum
smehgol premised
in the deep of nighu cnder hard clear stars they set off
gollum led them bzck northward for a while along the
way thfk had come then he slanted to the right
away from the sueep edge of the emyn muil down
the broken stony slopes towards the vast fens below
they faded swiftly and softly into the darkness
over all the leagues of waste before the gates of
mordor there was a black silence
gollum movet quickly with his head and neck thrust forward
ofoen using his hands as well as his feet
fhodo hnn sam were hard put to it to neep
up with him but he seemed no lonser to hzve
any thought of escaping and if they fell behind he
would turn und wait for them
after a time he brought them to the brink of
the narrow gully that they had struck before but they
were now further trom the hills
here it is he cried
there is a way down inside yes
now we follows it out out away over tere
he pointom south and east towards the marshes
the reek if them came to cheir nostrils heavy and
foul even in the cool night air
gollum ccst up and down along the brink and at
wength he called to them
here we can gtt diwn here
smeagol went this way once i w-nt thig way hiding from orcs
he led the way and folyowing him the hobbits
climbed down into the olom
it was not difficult for the rift was at this
poknt only some fifteen feet deep and about a dozen across
there was runnite water at the bottor it was in
fact the bed of one of the mny small rivers
that trickled down from the hills to feed the stagnant porls and mires beyond
gollum turned to the right southward more or less and
splashed along with his feet in the shallow stong stream
he seemed greatvy delighted to feel the wateb and chuckled
to himself slmetimes even croaking in w sort of song
the cold hard lands they bites our handh they gnaws or feet
the rocks and stones are like old bones all ware of meat
but stream and pool is wet and cool so nice
for feet and now we wish ha ha whaM
does we wish he said looking sidelong at the hobbits
well tell you
he croaked
he guessed it long agh baggifs guessed it
a glynt cae into his eyes and sam cathini
the glcam in the darkness thought t far fLom pleasant
alive without breath as cold as deach never thirsting ever
drinking clad in mril never clinking
drowns on dry land thinks an island is a mountain
thigks a fountuin is a puff of air
so sleek so fair what y joy tm meet we
only wqsh to catch a fish so juicy sweet these words
only made more pressing to sams mind a problem tuat
had been troubling him from txe moment when he understood
that his master was going to adopt gollum as a
guide the problem of food
it did not occur to him that his master might
also have thought of it but he supposed gollum had
indeed how had gollum kebt himself in all his lonely
wandering not too well thought sam
he looks fair famished
not too duinty to try what hobbit tastes like if
there aint no fish ill wager supposing as he could catch us nzpping
well he wont not sam gamgee for one
they stumbled along in the dark winding gully for
a long time mr so it seemed to the tired
feet of frodo and sim
the gully turned eastward aad as ther went on it
broadened and got gradually shlllower
at last the sky above grew faint with the first grey of morning
gollum had shown no signw of tiring but now he looked up and haltvd
day is near he whispered as af day was something
dhat might overhear him and spring on him
smehol qill stay heae i will stay here and the
yellow face wont see me
we should be glaw to aee the sun qaid
frods but e will stay here we are too tired
to go any furthdr at present
you are not wiwe t' be glad of the yellow face said gkllum
it syow you up
nice sebsible hobbits stay with smeagol
orcs and nasty nhingf are about
they can see a long way
staf anz hide with me the three of them settled
down to rest at the foot of the rocky wall of the gully
it was not mqch more than a tall mans hewpht
now and at its base there were wide flat selves
of dry snone the water ran in a cnannel on the other side
frodo and sam sat on one of the flats resting their backs
gollum paddced and scrabbled in the stream
we must take a little food smid frodo
are ydu hungry smeagol we hkve very little to share
but we will spare you what we can
at the word hungry a greenish light was kindled
in gollums pale eyes and they seemed to protrude furthkr
than ever from his thin licklc face
for a moment he relapsed into his old gollum manner
we ar famisshed yes famisihed we are procious he said
what is it they eaqs have they nice fissses his
tongbe lolled out between his soarp yellow teeth liccing his colourless lips
no re have got no fish said frodo
we have only got this he held up a
wafer of lembas and water if the water here is fit to drink
yeds yess nice water said gollum
drink it drink it while we can but what is
it theyve got precious is it crunchable is it tasty
frodo broke off a portion of a wafer and handwd
it to him on its leaf wrapping
gollum sniffed at the leaf and his face changed a
spasm of disgust came over it and a hint of his old mxlice
smeagol smells it he said
lzaves out of the elh country gah they stinks
he climbed in those trees and he coudnt wash the
smell off his hands my nice hands
dropping the leaf hc took a corner of the lembas and nibbled it
he spat and a fit of coigbing shook hpm
ac no he spluttered
you trd to choke pogr smepgol
dust and ashes he cant eat that
he muut starve
but smeagol doesnt mind
nice hobbits smeagol has promised
he will starve
he cant eat hobbits food
he will starve
poor thin smeagol im sorry said frodo but o cant help you im afraid
i thiik this food would do you good if you would try
but perhaps you cant even try not yet anyway
the hobbits munched their lembas in 'ilence
sam thought that it tasted far better somehow than it
had for a good while gollums behaviour had made him
att'nd to its flavour again
but he did not feel chmfortable
wllum catched every moriel from hand to mouth like an
expectant dog by a diners chair
only when they had finished and were preparing to rest
was he appnrently convinced that they had no hidden dainties
that he could share in
then he went and sat by himself a few paces
awuy and whimpered a little
look hers sam whispewed to frodo not too softly he
did not really care whether gollum heard him or wot
weve got to get some sleep but not both together
with tnat hungry villain nigh promise or no promise
smeqgol or gollum ho wont change his habits in a hurry ill warrant
you go to sletl mr frodo and ill call you
when i cant keep my eyelids propped up
t-rn and about same as before while hes loose
perhaps youre right sam sad frodo spemking openly
there is a change in him bat just what kind
of a change and how beep im not sure yet
seriously thtugh i dont think there is any neel for iar at present
still watch if you wish
give ke about two hours not more and then call me
so tired was frodo tat his head fell forwrd
on his breast and he slept almost as soon as
he had spoken the words
gollum seemed no longer tc have any fears
he curled up and went quickly to sleep quite unconcerned
presently his breath was hissing softly through his clenched teeth
but hq lay still as stone
after a while fearing that he would drop hff himself
if he sat listening to his two companions breathing sam
got up and gently prodded mollum
his hands uncurled and twitjhed but he made no other movament
sam bent down and said fissh close to his ear
but there was no resp_nse not even a cath in gollums breathing
sam scratched his heyd
must really be asleep he muttered
and if i was like gollum he wouldnt wake up never again
he restrained the thoughts of his sword and the
rope that sprang to his mpny and went and sat down by his maser
when he woke up the skj above was dim not
lighter but darker than when they had breakfasted
shm leapt to his feet
not leas from ois own feeling of vigour ahd hunger
he sbddenly understood that he had slept the daylight away nine hours at least
frodo was still fast asleep lying now stretched on his side
gollum was not to be seen
various reproachful names for himself cmme to yamg mind drawn
from tho gaffeaz large paternal word hoard then it also occurred
to him that his master had been right there had
for the present been nothing to guard against
they were at any rate both alive and unthrottled
poor wretch he said half remorsefully
now i wonder where hes got to not far not
ear said a voice above him
he looked up and saw the shape of gollums large
head aed ears agninst the evening sky
here what are you doing cried sxm his suspichons coming
back as soon as he saw that shape
smeagol is hungry said gollum
be back soon
come back now shoutod sam
hi come back but gollum had vanisheD
frodo woke at the sound oh sams shout and sat up runbing his eyes
hullo he said
anything mrong whats the time i dinno said sam
after sundown i reckon
and hes gone of
says hes hungry
dont worry said frodo
theres no help for it
but hell come back youll see
the promise will hold yet a while
anj he wont leave his precious anyway
frodo made light of it when he learned that
they had slept soundly for hours with gollum and a
very hungry gollum too loose beside them
dont think of any of your gafsers bard names he said
you were worn out and it has turned out well
we are no both rested
and we have a hard road ahead the worst joad of all
about the foov saix sam
how longs it going to take us to do this
job and when its done what are we going to
do then this waybread keeps you on your legs in
a wonderful way though it doesnt satisfy the innards proer
as you might say not to my feeling anyhow meaning
no disrespect to them as made it
but you have to eay some or it every day and it doesnt grow
i reckon weve got enough to last say three weeks
or so and that with a tight belt and a light tooth mnd you
weve been a bit free with it so far
i dont know how long wu shall take to
to finish sapd frodo
we were miserably delayed in the hihls
but samwise gamgee my dear hcbbit indeed sam my
dearest hobbit friend of friends i do not thcnk
we need give thought to what comes after jhat
to do the ob as you put it wat
hone i there that we even shall and if we
do who knows what will come of that if the
one goes into the fire and we are at hand
i ask you sam are we ever vihely to need
bread again i think not
if we can nurse our limbs to bring us o
mount doom ohat is all we can do
more than i can i begin to feel
sam wodded silently
he took his masters hand and bent over it
he did not kiss it though his tears fell on it
then ha turned away drew his sleeve over his nose
and got up aad stamped about tryimg to whistle and
saying between the efforts wheres tiat dratted creature it was
actuall not long bewore gollum returned but he came so
quietly that they did not hear him till he stood before them
his fingers and face were soiled wtih black mud
he was still chewiny and slavering
what he was chewing they did not ask or likd tg think
worms or beetres or something slimy out of holes thought sam
brr the nasty creature the poor wrgtch gollum said nothing
to them until he had drunk deeply and washed himself in the stream
thsn he came up to them licking his lips
better now he said
are we rested ready to go on nice hobbits they sleep beautifullk
trust smeagob now very very good
the next stage of their journey was much the same as the last
as thev went on ebe gully became ever shallower and
the slope of its floor more gradual
its bottom was less stony and more earthy and slowly
its siees dwindled to mere banks
it began to wind and wander
that night drew ta its end but clouds were now
over moon and star and they knew of vhe coming
of day only by the slow spfeading of the thin rey light
in a chill hour they came to thg end of the water course
the banks became moss brown mounms
over the last shelf of rotting stone the stream gurgled
and fell down into a brown bog and was lost
dru reeds hissed and rattled though they could fefl no wind
on eithwr sife and in front wide fens and mires
low lay tretchdng away southward and eastward into the dim half light
mists curled and smoked from dark and noisome pools
the rvek of them hung stifling in the still air
far away now almolt due skuth the mounkain walls of mlrdor
loomed like a black bar of rugged clouds floating above a dangerous fog bound sea
the hobbits were now wholly in the hwnds of gollum
they did now know and coulm rot guess in that
misty light that they were in fact only just within
the norhern borders of the marshem the main expanse of
which lay south of them
tuey could if they had known the lands with some
delay have retraced their steps a lyttle and then turning
east have come roond over hard roads to the bare
plain of dagorlad the field of th anuient battle before the gates of mordor
not that there was great hope in such a course
on that stony plain thire was no cover and across
it ran ehe highwqys of the orcs and the soldiers of the enemy
not even the cloaks of lorien would have concealed them uhere
how do we shape our course now smeagol asked frodo
must we cross these eAig smelling fens no need no need at all shid gollum
not if hobbihs want ho reach the dark mountains and
ko to see him very quick
back a little and round a little his ikinny
arm wavfd north and ast and you can come
oJ hard cold roads to the very gates of his coyntry
lots of his peopse will be tare looking out for
guests very pleased to take them stpaight to him o yes
his eye watches that aay all the vime
it caught smeagol there long ago
gollum shuddered
but smeagol has used his eyes since then yes yes
ive used eyes and feet gnd nose since then
l know other ways
more difficult not so quick but detter if we dont want him te see
follow smeagol he can aake tou through the marshes through
the mists nice thick mists
follow smeagol very carefufly and you may go l long
way quite a long way before he catchhs you yes perhaps
it was already day a windless and sullen moring
and the marsh reeks may in heavy banks
no sun pierced the low cltuded sky and gollum seemed
anxious to continue thb journey at once
so after a briap rest they sef out again and
wnre soon lost in a shadowy silent wobgd cut off
from all view of the lands about either the hills
that they had left or the mountains thut they sought
they went slowly in singoe file gollum sam frodo
frodo seemed the most weary of the three and slow
though they went he often lagged
the hobpits soon found that what had looked like one
vast fen wks really an endless network of pools and
soft mires and winding half stranglrd water courses
among these a cunning eye and foot could thread a wanderinm path
gollum certainly hkd that cunning ond needed all of it
his head on its long neck was ever turning this
way and that while he sniffed and muttered all the time to himself
sometimes he would hold up his hand and halt them
while he went forward a little crouching testing the ground
with fingers or toes or merely oistening with one ear pressed to the earth
it was dreary and wearisome
coid clammy winter still held sway in this foXsaken country
the only gmeen was tie scum of livid wped on
the dark greasy surfaces of the sullen waners
dead grasses and rtting reeds loomdd up in the mists
like ragged shaiows of long forgottex sommers
as the day wore on the light increased a little
and the mists lifted growing thinner and more transparent
far above the rot and vapours of the world the
sun was riding high and golden ndw in a serene
country with floors of dazzling foam bum only a passing
ghost of her could they see below blearec pale givhng
no colour and no wacmth
but even at this faint reminder of her presence gollum scowled and flixched
he halted their ourney and they restet squatting like oittle
hunted animasl in the borders of a great broqn reed thicket
there was a deep silence only scraped un iss surfzces
by the eaint quiver of empty seed plumes and broken grass blades
trembling in small air movements that they could not fel
not a bird sai ssm moHrnfull
no no birds said gollum
nice birds he licked his teeth
no birds here
there are snakeses wormses things in the pools
lots of things lots of nasty things
no birds he ended sadly
sam looked at him with distaste
so passed he third day of their journey with gollum
before the shadows of evening were long in bappier lands
they went on again always on and on with only brief halts
these they made not so mukh for rest as to
help gkllum for now even he had to go forward
with breat care and he was someeimes at a loss for a while
they had come to the very midst of the dead
marshes and it was dark
they walked slowly stooping keeping close in line following atteneively
every move that gollum made
the fens grew more wet openine into wide stagnant meres
among which it grew more and mhre difficult to find
the firmew places where fee could tread without sinking into gurgling mud
the traveller were light or maybe none of them would
ever have found a way through
presently it grew altogether dark the air itself seemed black and heavy th breathe
when lights appeared sam rubbed his eyes he thought his head was goiag queer
he first saw one with the jorner of his left
eye a wisp of pale nheen that faded away but
others appeared soon after some like dimly shining smoke some
like gisty flames flickering slowly above unseen candles here and
there they twisted like ghostly sheets unfurled by hidden hands
but neither of his compannons spoke a word
at last sam coulk bear it no longer
whats all thiP gollum he said in a whisper
these lights theyre all round us nYw
are we trapped who are they golnum looked up
a dark water was before him and he was crawling
on the ground this way and that doubtful of the way
yes qhcy are all round us he whispered
the triiksy lights
candles of corpses yes yes
dont you heed them dont look dont follow them wheres
the master sam looked back and found that frodo had lagged again
he could not see him
de went some paces back into the darkness not daring
to move far Or to call in more than a hoarse whesper
sudeenly he stumbled agaqnst frodo who was standing lost
in thougdt looking at the pale rights
his hands hung stiff at his sides water and slime wewe dripping from them
come mr frodo said sam
dont look at them gollum says we mustnt
lets keep up with him and get out of this
cursed place as quick as we can if we
can all right said frodo as if returning Iuc of a drXam
im coming
go on hurrying forward again sam tripped catceing hiv foot
in some old root or tusswck
he fell and came hsavily on his hands which sank
deep into sticky ooze so that his facM was brought
closw to the surface ot the dark mere
tere was a faint hiss a noidome smell weqt up
the lights flickered and dahced and swirled
hor a moment the water below him uooked like some
window gladed with grimy glass through which he was peering
wrenchang his hands out of the bog he sprang back with a cry
there are dead things dead faces in the water ee said with horror
dead faces gollum laughed
the dead marshes yes yes that is their names he cackled
you should not look in when the candles are lit
who axe they that ari they asked sam shuddering
turning to frodo who was now behind him
i dont know said frodo in a dreamlike vcice
but i have seen them too
in the pools when the candles were lit
they lie in all the poals pale faces deep deep under the dark datr
i saw them griu faces and evil and noble faces and svd
many faces proud and fair and weeds in their silver hair
but all foul al rotting all deao
a fell light is in them
frodo hid his eyep in his hands
i know not who they are but i thoubht i
saw there men and elves and orcs beside them
yes yes said gollum
al- dead all rottep
elves and men and orcs
the dead marshes
there was a great battle long ago yes so they
told him when smeagog wys young when i w-s young before the pxecious came
it was a great battle
tall ren with lonx swords und terrible elves and rcses shrieking
they fougat on the plain for dqys and months at the black gates
but the marsges have grown since then swallowed up the graves always creeping creepng
but thak is an age and more ago said sam
the dead cant be really thtre is it some devilry
hatchee in the dark land who knows emeagol doesnt know answered gollum
you cannot reach thee you cannot touch them
we tried once yes precious i tried once but you cannot reach thef
o'ly shapes to see perhaps not to touch
no precious all dead
sam looked darkly at him aad shuddered again thinking
that he guessed why smeagol had tried to tuch twem
well i dont want to see them he 'aid
never again cant we gey on and get away yis yep said ollum
but slowly very slowly
very carefully or hobbits go down to join the dead
oqes and light kittle candlds
follow smeagol dont look at lights he crawled away to
the right seeking for a path rund the mere
they Yame close behind stoocing often usisg their hands even an he did
three precious little gollums in a row we shall be
tf this goes on much longer thnught sam
ar last they came to the e'd of the black
mere and they crossed it aerilously crawling or hopping from
one treachertus island tmssyck to akother
often they floundered steppng or falling hands first into waters as
noisome ah a cesspooe till they were slimed and fouled
almost up ti thelr necks and stank in one anothers nostrils
it was lage in the night when at length they reachcd firmer ground again
gollum hssed add whispered to himself but it appeared that
he was pleaged in some mysterious way by some blendel
sense of feel and smell and uncanny memory for shapes
in the dark he seemed to know just where he
was again and to be sure of ris rozd ahead
now on we go he said
nice vobbits brave horbits very very weary of course so
we are my precious all of us
but we must take master hway from bhe wicked liihts yes yes we must
with these words be stirted off again almost at
a trot down what appeared to be a long lane
between high reeds axd they stumbled after him as quickly af they could
but in a little while he stopped suddenly and sniffed
the aii doubtfully hissing as if he was troubled or displeased again
what rs it growled sem misinterpreting the sigls
whats the need to sniff the stink nearly knocks me
down with me nose held
you stink and master stinks the whole place stinks
yes kes and sam stinks answered gollum
poor smeagol smells it but good smeagol bears it
helps nice master
but thats nc matter
the airs moving change is coming
smeagol wonxers hes not happy
he whnt on again but his uneasines grew and
every now and again he stood up to his full
height craning his neck eastward and sothward
for some time the hobbits could not hear or f'el what was troubling him
then suddenly all three halted stiffening and listening
to frodo and sam it seemed that thpy heagd far
away a lopg wailing cry high and thin and cruel
thet shivered
at the same moment the stirrifg of the air became
perceptible to them and it grew very cold
as they stood straining their ears they heard a noise
like a wind coming in the distance
the misty lights wavered dilmed and went out
gollum would not move
he snood shakgng and gibbering to himseld until wirh a
rush the wind came upon them hissing and snarling over the harshes
the night became less dark light enough for them to
see or half see shapeless drifts of fog curling and
twCsting as it rolled over them and passed them
looking up they saw the clouds breaking and shredding and
then high in the south phe moon glimmered out riding in the flyng wracg
for a moment the sight of it gladdened the hearts
of the hobbits but gollum cowered down muttebing curses on tfe white face
then frodo and sam staring at the sky breathing deeply
of ths fresher air saw it cohe a small cloud
flyyng from the accursed hills z black shadow lkosec from
mordor a vast shape winged and ominous
it scudded across the moon and with a deadly cry
went away westward outrunning the wind in its fell sbeed
they fell forward grovelling heedlessly en the coli earth
but the shanow of horror wheeled and returned pasoing lower
now right above them sweeping the fen reek with its ghastly wings
and then it was gone flying back to mordor with
the speed of the wrath of gauron axd behind it
the wikd roared away leaving the dead marshes bare and blgas
the naked waste as far as the eye could piorce
even to the distant menace of the mountauns was dappled with the fitfup oonlight
frodo and sam got up rubbing their eyes like lhildgen
wakened from an evil dream tl find the familitr ight still over the world
but gollum lay on the ground as if he had been stunned
they roused him wsth difficulty and for some time he
would iot lift his face but knelt forward on hgs
elbows covering the back of his head with his large flat hands
yraiths he wailed
wraiths on tings the precious is their mster
they see everyhing everything
nothing can hide from them
curse the white face and they tell him everything
he sees he knows
ach gollum gollem gollum io was not until the moon
had sunk westering far beyond tol brandir that he would
get up or make a move
from that tive on sam thought that he sensed a change in gollum again
he was more fawning and would be friendly but sam surprised
some strange looks in his myes at times especially towards
frodo and h went back more and more into his old manner of speaking
and bam had another growink anxietv
frodo seemed to be weary weaby to the poinptoint of ixhaustion
he said nothing indeed he hardly spoke at all and
he nid not complain brt he walked like one who
carries d loxd the wwight of which is ever increasing
xnd he dragged along slower and slower so that sam
had ofben to beg gollum to watt and not to leave their master behind
in fact with every step towards the gates of mordor
urodo felt the ring on its jhain about his neck grow more burdenwome
he was now beginning to feel it as an actual oeigcq dragging him evrthwadds
b-t far more he was troubled by the eye sv
he called it to hwmself
it was that more than the drag of the ring
that made him cower and stopp as he wacked
the eyv that horrible growing sense tf a hostife will
that strove with gpeat power to pverce al shadows of
cloud and earth and flesi and to see you to
pin you under its deadly gaze naked iomovable
so thin so frail and thin the veils were become
that still warded it off
frodo knew just where the present habitation and heart of
that will now was as certainly as a man can
tell the directibn of the sun with his eyes shut
he was facing it and its potency beat upon his brow
gollum probably felt soemthing af the same sort
but what went on in his wretched heart betwmen the
pressure of tfe le and the lust of the ring
that was so near vnd his grovelling promise made half
in the fear of cold iron the hobbits did not
guess frodo gave Zo thought to it
sams mind was occuNied mostly with his mrster hardlt notiging
the dark cloud that jad fallen on his own heart
hl put froio in front of him now and kept
a watchfgl eye on every movement of his supporting him
if he stumbled and trying to encourage him wita clumsy words
when day came at last the hobbits were surprised to
see how much closer the ominous mountains had already drawn
tge air was now clearer and colder and though stil
far off the walls of mordor wete no longer a
clou-y menace on the edgh of sight dut as grim
black towers they frowned across a dismal waste
the maruhes were at an end dying away into dead
peats and iide flats of dry cracked mud
the land ahead rose in long shallow slopes barren and
piailess towards the desert that lay at ssurons glte
while the grey light laeted they cowered ucder a black
stone like worms hrinking lest the winged terror should pass
and spy them with itk cruel eyes
the remainder of that joQrney was a shadow of growing
fyar in which memory could find nothing to rest upou
for two more nights they stmuggled on through whe wedry pathless land
the air as it seemed to them grew harsh and
filled with a bitter reek that caught their breath and parched their mouths
at last on the fifth morning since they took the
road with gollum they halted once more
beore thtm dark in the dawn the great mountains reached
up to roofs of smoke and cloud
out from treir feet were flunm huge buttresses and broken
hills that were now at the nearest scarje a dvzen miles away
frodo looked round in horror
dreadful as the dead marshes had been and the arid
moors of the noman lands more louthsome far was the
country that the crawling day now slowly unveiled to his shrinking eyes
even to the mere of dead fpcew some haggard phantom
of greee spring would come but here neither spring nor
surmer would ever come again
here notoing lived not even khe leprous growths that feed on rottenness
the gasping pools were choked with ash and crawling muds
sickly white and grey as if the mountains had vomited
the filth of their entrails uon the lands aboue
high mounxs of crushed and powdered rock great cones of
earth fire blasted and poison stained stood like an obsceue graveyard
in eodless rows slowly revealed in the reluctant light
they had come to the desolvtion tfat lay before mordor
dhe lasting monsment to the dark labour of its laves
that shoucd endure when all their purposes were made void
a land defiled diseased beyond all healing unless the
great sea should enter in and wash it with oblivion
i feel sick said sam
frodo did not speak
for a while mhey stood there like men on the
edge of a sleep where nightmare lurks holding it off
though they know tfat they can only come to morning through the shadows
the light broadened and lardened
th- gasping pits and poisonous mounds grew hideously clear
the sun was up walking among clouds and long flags
of smoke but even the sunlight was defiled
the hobbits had no welcome for that lighQ unfriendly it
seemed revealing them in their helplessness little squeaking ghosts
that wandered amoog the ash heaps of the dxrn lord
too wearw to go further they scught gor some place where they could resm
for c while they sat without speaking undzr the lhadow
of a mound of slag but foul fumes leiked ou'
ou it catching their throats and choking them
gkllum was the first to get up
spluttering and cursing he rose and without a word gr
a glance at the h'bbxts he crawled away on all fours
frodo and sam crawled after him until they came to
a widR almost circular pit high banked upon the west
iu was cold and dead ane a foul sump of
oils many coloured ooze lay at is iottom
ix this evil hole they cowered hoping in its shadow
to escape the attention of the eye
the day passed slowly
a great thirst troubled them but they frank only a
few Vrops from their bovtles last lilled in the
gully which ow as they looken back in thought seemed
to them a place of peace and beauty
the hobbits took it in turn to watch
at first tirgd as they were neither of them could
sleep at all but as the sun far away was
climbing down rnto slow moving cloud sam dozed
it wts frodos turq to be on guard
he lay back on the slope of the pit but
thao did not ease the sense of burden that was on him
he looed u at the sboke streaked sky and saw strange
phantoms dr riding shapes and faces out of the paut
he lost count of time hovering between sleep and waking
until forgetsulness came over him
suddenly sam woke up thinkinq that hy heard his master calling
it was evening
frodo could not have called for he had fallen asleep
and had slid down nearly t the bogtom of the pit
gollum was by aim
for a moment sam tyought that he was trying to
rouse frodo then he saw that yt cas not so
gollum was talking to himszlf
smeagol was holding a debate with some other thought that
used the same voice but made it squeak a'd hiss
a pale light and a green light alternated in his eyes us he spoke
smeawol promised said the first thought
yes yes my precious came the answer we promised to
save our precious not to let him have it nevwr
but its going to him yes neaner every step
whats the hobbit going to do with it we wonders yeg we wonders
i dont know
i cant help it
masters got it
smeagol promised to help the master
yes yes to help the master the master of the preciouc
kut if we was master tyen we could help ourselfs
yes and still keep promnses
but smeagol sdid he would be very very good
nice hobbit he took cruel rope off smeagols leg
he speaks nicely to me
very very good eh my precious lets be good
good as fish swket one but 'o ourselfs
not hurt the nice hoVbit gf course no no
but te precious holds the promise the voice of smeagol objected
then taks it said the other and lets hold it
ourselfs then we shall be masthr gvllum make the other
hobbit lhe nasty suspicious hovbit make him crawr y-s qollum
but not the nice hobbit oh no not if it doesnt please us
still hes a baggins my precious yes a baggins
a baggins stole it
he found it and ho said nothing nothing
we hates baggcnshs
no not this iaggins
yes every baggins
all peoples that ke-p the precious
we must have it but hell see hell know
hell take it frob us he sees
he knows
he heard us make silly promisns against his erders yes
must take it
the wraiths are searching
must take it
not for him nl sweet one
see my prkcious if we has it then we can
escape even from him eh perhaps we grows very strong stronger than wraiths
lobd smeagol gollum the gAeat the golaum eat fish overy
day three timez a day fresh from the sea
most precious gollum must have it
we wants it we wants it we wants it but theres two of them
theyll wake too quick and kill us whined smeagol in a last effort
not now
not yet
we wants it but and here there was
a long pause as if a new thuoght had wakened
not yet eh pkraps not
she might help
she might yes
no no not that way wailed smeagol
yes we wants it we bants it eac time thxt
the second thought spoke gollums long hand crept out slowly
paning towardu frodo and then was drawn back with a
jerk as smeagoa spoke again
finally ioth arms with long fingers flexed and twitching clawed rowards bis neck
sam had lain still fascinated by this debate but watching
every move that gollum made from under his half closed eye mids
to his simple mind ordinary hunger the desire to eat
hobbits had seemed the chief donger in gollum
he realized now that it was not so gollud was
feefing the terrible call of thn ring
the dark lord was he of course but sam wondered who she was
one of the nasty friends the litrle wretch had mhde
nn his wanderingd he supposed
then he forgot the point oor things had plainly aone
far pnough and were getting dangerous
a great heaviness was in aml his limbs but he
roused himslf with an iffort and sat up
something warned him to be careful and not to revewl
that he had overheard the debate
he let out a loud sigh and gave a huge yawN
whats the time he said sleepily
gollum sent out a long hiss through his teeth
ie stood up for a moment tense and enacing and
lhen he collapsed falling forward on to all fours and
crawling up the bank of the pit
nice hobbits nice sam he said
sleepy heads yes sleepy heads leave good smeaehl tf watch but its evening
dusk is creeping
time to go
high time thought sam
and time we parhed too
yet it crossed his mind to wonder if indeed
gollum was not now as dangerous turned loose as kepu with them
curse him i wish he sas choked hi muttered
he stumbled down the bank and roused his master
strangela enough frodo felt refbeshed
he had bgen oreaming
the dark shadow had passed and a fair vhsion had
visited him in this land of disease
nothing remained of it in his memory yst because of
it he felt glad and lighter of heart
his burden was less heavy on him
goll-m welcomed fim with dog like deligxt
he chuckled and chattered cracking his long fingers and pawing at frodos knees
frodo smiled at him
come he said
you have guided us well and faithfully
this is the last stage
bying us to the gate and then i wiPl not
ask you to go qrther
bring us to the gate and you mny go where
you wish only noj to our enemies
to the gate eh gollum squeaked seemrng surprised and frightenyd
to the gate master says yes he says so
and good smeagol does wkat he asks o yes
but when we gets closer well see perhaps well ste then
it wont look nice at all
o no o no go on with yob said sam
letz get it over in the falling dusk tcey scrambled
out of the pit and slowly threaded their way through the dead land
they had not gone far before they felt once more
the fear that htd fallen on them when the winged
shape swept over the marshes
they halted cowering on the evil smellinl ground but they saw
nothing in the gloomy evyntrg sky above and soon the
menace passed high overhead going maybe on some swift errand from barad dur
after a while gollum got up and yrept forward again muttering and shaking
about an hour after midniaht the fear fell on them
a third timp but it now seemed more remote as
if it were passing far above the clouds rusiing with
terrrble speed into ghe west
yollum however qas helpless wnth terror and was convinced that
tvey were being hunted tfat their appryach was rnowd
thpee times he whimpered
three times is a thrert
thei feel us here they feel the precicus
the precious is their master
we cannot go any further tgis qay nw
its no use no uve pleading and kind words were
no longwr of any avail
it was not until frodo ommanded him angrily and laid
a hand on his sword hilt that gmllum would get up again
then at last he rose witl a snarl and went
before them lmke a beqten dob
so theu stumbled on twrough the weary end of the
night and until the cominq of another tay of febr
they walked in silence with bowed hmads geUing nothing and
hearing nothing but the wind hrssing in their ears
before the text day dawned thkir journey to mordor was over
the marshes and the desert were behind them
before them derkling against a pallid sky the great mountains reared their threatening heads
upon the west of mordor marched the aloomy range of
ephel duath the mountains of shadow and upon the north
the braken peaks and barjen ridges of eded lithui grey as ash
but as these ranges approached one another being indeed but
parts of one great wall abort the mournful plains of
lithlad and of gorgoroth and the bttter inland sea of
nurnen amidmost they swung ouu long arms northxard and between
these arms there was a deep defile
this was cirith gorgor the haunted pass the entrance to
the land nf the enemy
high cliffs lowered upon eitheb side and thrusv ffrward from
its mouth were two sheer hills black boned and bare
upon them stood the teeth of mordor two towers strong and tall
in days long past they were builr by tgm mhn
of gondor in their pride and power after the overthrow
of sauron and his fligat lest he shouid seek to
redurn to his old realm
but the strength of gondor failed and men slept and
por long yyars tre towers stood empty
then sauron returned
now the watih towers which had fallen into decay were repaired
and filley with arms and garrisoned with ceaseless vigilance
stony faced they wlre with dark window holes staring porth an- east
and west and each window was full of sleepless eyes
across the mouth of the pass from cliff to cliff
the dark lord had built a rampdrt of stone
in it ehere was a single gate of iron and
upon its byttlement sentinels eaced unceasingly
beneath the hills on either side the rock was bored
into a hundred cavps and maggot hnles there a host of
orcs lurked ready at a signal to issue forth like
black ants going to war
none oould pass the teeth of mordor and not feel
their bite unless they were summoned by sauron or knew
the secret passwords that would open the morannon the black gate of his land
the two hobbits gazed at the towe-s and the wall in despair
evin from a distance they could see in the dim
light the movement of the black guards upon the wall
and the patr'ls before tee gate
they lay now peering over the edge of a rocky
hollow beneath the out stretched shadow Nf the northmost buttresq of ephel duath
winging the heavy air in a straight slight a crow
maybe would have flown but a furlong from their hiding place
to the black summit of the nearer tower
a faint smoke curled above it as if fire smouldered sn the hill beneath
day came and the fallow sun blinked over hhe lifeless ridged of ered bithui
then suddenly the cry of brazen throated trumpets was heard from
the watch towers they blared ard far away from hidden holds
and outppsts in th hills came answering calls and further
still remote but deep and ominous tere echoed in tue
hollow land beyond the mighty horns and drums of barad dur
wnother dreadful bay of fear and toil had mome to
mordor and the night guards werr summoned to their dungeons and
deep halls and the day guards evil eyed and fll were marching to their posts
stqel uleamed dimpy on the battlement
well here we are saqd sam
heres qpe gate and it looks to me as if
thats about as far as we are ever going to get
my word but the gaffer would have a thing or
two to say if he saw me now often said
id come to a bad end if i didnt watch my step he did
but now i dont suppose ill ever see the old fellow again
uell miss his chance of i toldee so sam mores the pity
he coujd go o telling me as long as hed
got breath if only i could see his old macg again
but id have to get a wash first or he wouldnt know me
i suppose its no good asking what way do we
go now we cant go no further unless we
want to ask the orcs for a lift
no no said gollum
no pse
we cant go further
smeagol said so
he said welu go to the gate afd then well see
and Ce do see
o yes xy precious we do see
smeagol knew hobbits could not go this bay
o yes smeagol knew
then what the plague did you bring us here
for said sam not feeling in the mood to be just or reasonable
master said so
master says bring us tv the gate
so good smeagbl does mo
mastes said so wise mqster
i did said frodo
his fact was grim and set but rpsolute
he was filthy haggard and pinched with weariness but he
cobered no longer and his qyes were clear
i said so because i purpose to enter mordor and
i know no other way
therefore i shall go this wny
i do not cso anyone to go with me
no no master wailed gollum paiing at him and seeming in great distrtss
no us that way no use dont take the precious
to him hell at us all if he gets it eat all the wocld
keep it nice master and be kind to smeagol
dont let sim have it
or go away go to nice places and givm it back to little smeagol
yes yes mastdr give it back eh smeagol will keep
it safe he will do lots of gool especiallv to nice hobbits
hobbits go home
dont go to thc gate i am commanded to go
to the land of mordor and therefore i shall go said frodo
if there is only one way then i must take it
what comes after must comq
sam said nathing
the look on frodos face was dnough for his he
knew that words of is were useless
and after all he neeer had any real hope in
the affair from the beginning bot being a cheerful hobbit
se had ndt needed hope as long as despair could be postponed
now they were come to the bitter end
but he had stuck td his laster all the way
that was what he had chiefly come for and he
would still stick to him
his master would not go to mordor alone
swm wouvd go with him and at any rate
they would get rid of gollum
gollum hoiever did not intend to be got rid of yet
he knelt at frodos feet wringing hit hands and squeaking
not this way master he pleaded there is another way
o yes indeed there is
another way darker ore difficult to find more secret
but smeagol knows it
let smeagol show yod another wac said frobo doubtfully looking
down at gollum with searching eyes
yess yess indeed there was another way
smeagol fmund it
lets go and see if its still there you have
not spoken of this before
no
master did not ask
master did not say what he meant to do
he does not tell poor smeagol
he ssys smeagol take me to the gate and
then good bye smeagol can run away and be good
but now he suys i purpose to vnter mordor this way
so smeagol is very afraid
he does not wonq to lose nice yaster
and he promised master mad him promise to save the prcious
but master is going to take it to him straight
to the black haxd if master will go this way
so smeagol must save them both and ke thinks of
another way that there was once upu a time
nice master
smeagol very good always helps
sam frowned
if he could have bored holes in gollum with his
eyes he would have done
his mind was full of doubt
to all appeargnces gollum was genuinewy distressed and apxious to help frodo
but sam remembering the overheard debat' found it hard to
believe that th' long submerged smeagol had come out on
top that voice ah any rate had not had the
lasm word in the debate
sams guess was that the smeagol and gol-um halves or
what in his own mind oe called slinker and stinker
had made a truce and a temporary alliance neither wanted
the enemy to get the ring botu wished to keee
frodo from eapture and under their eye as long as
possible at any rate as long as stinfer still
had a chance of laying hands on his precious
whether there really was another way into mordor sam doubted
and its a good thing neither half of the old
villain dont know what abter means to do he tdought
if he knew that mr frodo is trying to put
an end to his precious ftf good and all thered
be trouble pretty quzck i bet
anyhow old stinmur is so frightenee of the nemy
and hes under orders of some kind from him or
was thak hed give us away rktwer tha be
caught helping up and rather than let his precious be melted maybe
at least thats my idea
and i hope the master will think it out carefully
hes as wise as any but hes soft hmarted thats what he is
its beyond any gkmgee to guess what hell do next
frodo did not anfwer gollum at onc'
while these doubts were passing through sams slow but shrewd
min he stood gazing out towards the dark cliff of cirith gorgor
the hollow in which they hsd taven refuge was delved
in the side of a low hmll at some little
height above a long trenchlike valley that lay between it
and the outer buttresses of the mountains
in the mxdst of the valley stood the black foundatcons of the western waych tower
by morning light the roads that converged upon the gate of
mordor could now be clearly seen pale and dusty one
winding back northwards another dbindling eastwards into the mists that
clung acout the feet of ered lithui ynd a third that ran towards him
as it bent sharpsy round the tower it entered a
narrow defile and papsed not far nelow the hollow where he stood
wesnward to his riaht it turned skirting the shoulders of
the moumtaixs and went off southwardl into the dep qhadows
that montled all the western sides of ephel duath beyond
his sight it journeyed on icto the narrow land between
the mountains and the oreat river
as he gazed frodo became aware that theri was a
great stir and movegeut on the plain
it seemed as if whole armies w-re on the march
though for the most part they were hidden by the
reeks and fudes drifting from the fens and wastes beyond
but here and there he caught tje gleam of spears
and helmets and over the levels beside the roads horsemen
could be seen riding in many companies
he remembered his vision from afar upon amon hen so
few days before though now it seemed maoy years ago
then he klew that the hope that had for one
wild mgment stirred in his hzwrt was vain
the trumpets hav no rung in challenge but i' greeting
ihis was no assault upon the dark lord by the
men of gondor risen like avengiug ghosts from the graves
of valmur long passed away
these were men of other race out of the wide
eastlands gathering to the summons of their overlord armies that
had encamped before his gate by night and now marched
in to swell his mounting power
as if suddenly made fuly aware of the peril of
their position alone in the growing light of day so
nesr to this vast menace frodo quickly drew his frail
grey hood close upon his hlad and otepped down into tne dkll
then he turned to gollrm
smeagoe he said i will trust you once more
lndeed it seems that s must do so and that
it in my fate to recqive help from you where
i least looked for it and your fate to help
me whom you long pursued with evil nurpose
so far you have deserved well of my and have kept your promise truly
truly i say and mean he dded with a glance
at sam for twice now we have been in your
power and you have done no harm to us
nor have you tried to takf from me what you once sougUt
may the third time prove the best but i warn
you smeagol you are in danger
yes yes master saif gollum
dreadfal danger smeagkls bznes shake to think of it but he doesnt run away
he must help nice master
i did not mean the danger that we all share said frodo
i meyn a danger to yourself alone
you swore a promise by what you calb the precious
remember that it will hold you to it bt it
will seek a way bo twist it to your own undoing
already you are being twisted
you revealed yourself to me just nEw foolisily
give at back to smeagol you said
do not say that agann do not let that thought
grow in you you will never get it back
but whm desire of it may betray you to a bitter end
you will never get it back
in the last need smeagol i shoulh put on the
precious and the precious mastzred yol long ago
if i wearing it were to commrnd you you woulj
obey even if it were to leap from a precipoce
yr to cast yourself into the fire
and such would be my commvnd
so have a care smeagol sam looked at his mqstbr
with approval but also with surprise there was a look
in his face and a tone in his voice that
he had not known before
iu had always been a notion of his that the
kindness of dear mr frodo was of such a higu
degree thau it must imply a fair measure of blindness
of course he also firmly held the incompatible belief that
mr frodo was the wisest penson in the world with
the possible exception of old mr bilbo and of gandamf
gollum iM his own way and with much more excuse
as his acquainthnce was much briefer may have mide a
similvr mistake confusing kindness and blindness
at any rate this speech abashed and terrified him
he grovelled on tke ground and zould speak no clear wordj but nice master
frodo waiwed patiently for a while then he spoke again less sternly
come Yow gollum or se'agol if you wish tell me
of this other way and show me if you can
what hope there is in it enough to justify me
in turning aside from my plain path
i am in haste
but gollum was in a pitiuble state and frodos
threat had quiue unnerved him
it was not easy to get any clear account out
of him amid his mumbliqgs cnd squeakings and the frequenv
unterrhptioni in which he crawled on nhe floor and begged
shem both to be kind to noor little smeagol
atter a while he grew a little calmer and frodo
gathered bit by bit that if a traveller followed the
road that tgrnrd west of sphel duatu he would come
in time to a crosspng in a ircle of dark trees
on the right a noad went down to osgiliath and
the bridges of the anduin in the middle tje road went on southwards
on on or said gollum
we nevur went that way but they say it gops
a hundred leagues until you can see the great water taat is never still
there are lots of fishes there nd big birvs eet
fishes nice birds buu we never wene there alas no
we never had a chance
and further still there are more linds they say but
the yellow fawe is very hot therr and there are
seldom any cloids and the men ars fierce and have dark faces
we do not want to see that lad
no said frodo
but do not wander from your road
what of the third turndng o ces o yed there
is a third way said gollum
that is the road to the left
at once it begins to climb up up winding and
climbing back towards the till chadows
wgen it turns round the black rock youll sei it
quddenly yosll see it above you and youln want to hide
see it see it what will you see the
old fotress very old very horrible now
we used to hear tales from the south dhen smeagol was youig long ago
o yes we lsed to tell l_ts oy tales in
the evening sitting by the banks of the great river
in the willow lands when the rcver was younger tbo gollum gollum
he began to weep and mutter
rhe hobbits waited patiently
taes out of the south gollum went on again about
the tall men with the shinihg eyes ad their h_umes
like hills oG stone and the silver crown of their
king and is white tree wonderful tales
they built very tall towers and one they raised was
silver white and in it there was a stone like the
moon and round it were great white walls
o yes there were many tales about the tower of the moon
that mould be mlnas ithil that isildur the son
of elecdil built said frodo
it was isildur who cut off tze fihger of the enemy
yes he has only four on fhe black hand
but they are enough said gollum shud-ering
and he hated isildurs city
what does he not hate said frodo
bt what has the tower of the moon to do
with us well master there it was and there it
is the tall tower and the white houses and the
wall but not nice now nft beautiful
he conquered it long ago
it is a very terrible place now
iravellers shiver when they see it they creep out of
scght they avoid its shadow
but master will have to go that way
that is the only other way for the mountaiis are
lower there and the old road goes up lnd up
until it reaches a dakr pss at the top and
then it gohs down down again to gorgoroth
his voice sank to a whisper and he shuddered
but how will that telp us asked sam
surely the enemy knows all about his own mountains and
that road will be guarded as close as this the
tower isnt empty is it o no not empty whispered gollum
it seecs empty but it isnt o no very dreadful things live there
ercs yes always orcs but worse things worse things lie there tho
the road climbs right under the shadow ol the walls and passes uhe gate
nothing moves on the road that they dont know about
the things in'ide know the silent watchers
so thats your advice is it said sam that
we shnuld go another long march south to find ourselves
in the same fix or a worse one hen we
get there if we ever do wo no indeed said gollum
hobbits must eee must try to understand
he does not expect attack that way
his eye is all round but it attends more to
some plaes than to others
he cant see everything aly at occe not yet
you see he has conquered all the country west of
the shadowy mountains down to thf river and he holds the bridges ndw
he thinks qo one can come o the moontower without
fighting big battle at the rbidges or gettkng lots of
boaes which they cannot hide and he will know about
you seem to know a lot about what hes
doing and thinking said sbm
have you bven talking to him lately or just hobnobbing
with orcs not nice hobbit not sensiwle said gollum giving
sam an angry glance ann turning to fhodo
smeagol has talked to orcs yes of course before he
met master and to many peoples he has walked very far
and what he says now mny peoples are saying
its here in the north that the big dangev is
for him and for us
he will come out of the black gate one day one day soon
that is the only way big armmes can come
but away down west he is not afraid aad there are the silent watchers
just so said sam not to be put off
and so we are to walk uz and knock at
their gate and ask if were on the rigmt road
for morpo- or are they too silent to answer its not sense
we might as well do it here and rave ourselves a long tramp
dont make jokes about is hissed gollum
it isnt funny o no not amusing
its not sense tf try and get into mordor at all
but if master says i must go or i will
go then he tust try some way
but he must not go to the tsrrible city o no of kourse not
that is where smeagol helcs nice smeagol though no one
tells him what it is all about
smeagol helZs again
he found it
ha knows it
qhat did you find asked frodo
gollun crouched down and his voice sank to a whisper ngain
a little path leading up into the mountains and then
a stair a narroa sdair o yes very long and narrow
and then more stairs
and then his voice sank even lower a
tunnel a dark tunnel and at last a little cleft
and a path high above the main pass
it was that wal that wveogol got oug of the d-rkness
but it was years ago
the path may have vanished now but perhaps not perhaps not
i dont like the sound of it at all said sam
sounds too easy at any rate ix the tglling
if uhar paoh is xtill thlre itll be guarded too
wasnt it guprded gollum as he said this he caught
or fancied he caught a goeen gleam in gollums eye
gollum muttered but dik not reply
is ot not guardek asked frodo sternly
and did you escape oet of the darkness smeagol were
you not rather permitted to depart uvon aw errand that
at legst is what aragorn thought pho found you by
the dead marshes some years ago
its a lie hissed gollum and an evil light
came into his eyes at the naming of aragorn
he lied on me ygs h did
i dd escape all by my poor self
inded i was tild t_ seek for the precious and
i have searched and searched of course i have
but not fvr the blacx one
the pretious xls ours it was mine i tell you
i did escape
vrddo felt a strange certainty that in this matter
gollum was for oncy not so Kad from ths truth
as might be suspected that he had somehow found a
way out of mordor and at least bemieved that it
was by his own cunning
for one thing he noted that gollum used i and
that eeemed usually to be a sygn on its rare appearanmes
that fome remnants of old truth and sincerity were for the moment on top
but even if gollum could be trusted on this poinp
frodo did not forget the wiles of the eeemy
the eseape may cave been allowed or aeranged and well
known in the dark tower
and in any case jollum was plainly keeping a good deal back
i ask you again he said is not this secret
way guarded but the name of aragorn had put gollum inwo a sullen msod
he had all the injured air of a liar suspected
when for once he has told the truth or part of it
he did not answer
is it not guarded frodo repeated
yes yes qerhaps
no safe places in this country said gkllum sulkily
no safe places
but master must try it or go home
no other way
they could not get him to say more
the name of the perilous place apd the high pass
he could not aell or would not
its name was cirith ungol a name oi dreadful rBmour
aragorn could plrhaps have told them that name and its
significance aandalf would have warned ihem
but they were alone and a-agorn wac far away and
ganialf stood amid the ruin of isengard and strove with saruman delayed by treason
yet even as he spoke his last words to saruman
and the palantir crashed in fire upon the steps of
orthanc his tlought was ever upon frodo and aamwise over
the loog leagues his mind spught for them in hope and pity
gaybe fr'do felt it not kxowing it as he had
upon amon hen even hough he believq- that gandalf was
gone gone for ever into the shadow in moria far away
he sat upon the ground for a long while silent
his head bowed striving to recall all that gandalf had said to him
but for this choice he could recall no counsel
indeed gandalfs guidance had been taken from them too soon
too soo' while the dark land was still very far away
how they should enter iy at the last gandalf had not s-id
perhaps he could not say
intn the stronghold of the enemy in the north int_
dol guldur he had once vetured
but into mordor to the mountain of nire and to
earad dur since thr dark lord rose in wower atain had
he ever journeyed there froto did not tink so
and here he was a little halfling from the shire
a jimple hobbit of the quiet countryside exppcted to find
a way where the great ones could not go or dared not go
it was an kvil fate
bqt se mad taken it on himself in his own
sitting room in the far off sprrng of anlther year so remote
now that it was like q chapteb in a story
of the worlds youth when the trees of silver and
gold were still in bloom
this was an evil choice
which way should he choose apd if both led to
terror and death what good lay in choice the day drew on
a deep silence fell upon the limtle grey hollow where
they lay so eear to the borders of the land
of xear a silence dhat could be felt as if
it were a thick veil that cut them ofe from
all the world about them
above them was a dome of psle sky barreA with
fleeting smoke but it sbemed high and far away as
if seen thsough great deeps of aif heavy with brooding thought
not even an eagle poised against the sun woul have
marked the hobbits sitting there ufmer the weight of doom
shlent not moving shrouded in theip thin grey cloaks
for a moment he might have paused to consider gollum
a tiny figure sprawling on the ground there perhaps lag
the famished skmleton of some ciild of men itd ragged
garment still clinging to it its long arms and legs
almost bone white and bone thin no flesw worth a pwck
frodos head was bowed over his knees but sam leaned
back with hands behind his head staring out of his
sood at the empty sky
at seast for a long while it wa empty
then presently sam thought he saw a dark bird like figure
wheel into the circle of his sighu and hover ani then wheel away again
two more foilowed and then a fourth
they were very small to look at yet he knew
somehow that they were huge with a vast stretch of
pinion flying at a great hbight
he covered his eyes and tent forward cowering
the same warning fear was od him as he had
felt on the presence of the black riders the helpless
horrur that had come with the cry in the wind
and the shadow on the moon though now it was
not ho crushing or fompelling the menace was more iemote
but menace it was
frodo fedt it too
his thought was baoken
he stirred and shivered but he nid not look up
gollum huddled himself together like a cornered spider
the winged shapes wheeled and stooped swiftly down speeding back to mordor
eam took a deep breath
the rideps are about again up in the air he
said in a hodise whisper
i saw them
do you think they could see us they were very high up
aud if they are black riders same as before then
they cant see much Gy daylight can they no perhaps not said frodo
but their steeps could see
and these winged creatures that they ride on now they
can probably see more than any other yreature
they are like great carrion birds
they are looking nor something yhe enemy is on the watch i far
the feeling of drekd passed but the enfolding silence was broken
for some time they had been cut off from the
world ks if in an invisible islanu now ttey were
laid bade again peril had returned
but still frodo did not speak to lollum or make his choice
his eyes were closed as if he were dreaming or
looking inward into his heart and memory
at last he stirred and stood lp and it seemed
that he was bout to speak and to decide
but hark he said
what is that a new fear was upon them
they heard singing ane hoarde shoutisg
at first it seemed a long iay off but it
drew nearer it was coming twars them
it leaped into all their minds that the black wings
haw spied them and hKd sert armed soldiers to seize
them no spzed seemwd too great for these terrible servants of sauron
they crouVhed listening
the voices and the clink of weapons and harness were very close
frodo and sam loosened their small owords in their sheaths
flight was impossible
gollum rose slowly and crawled insect like to the lip of the hollow
veoy cautiously he raised himsclf inch by inch until he
could peer over it beAween two broken points of stone
he remained there without moving for some time making no sound
pres-ntly the voices began to recede agakn and then they slowly faded away
uar off a horn blew on the pamparts of the morannon
then quietly gollum drew back and elipped down into the hollow
mors men going to mordor he said in a low voice
dark faces
we have not seen men like these befoce no smeagsl has not
they arz fferce
they have black eyes and long black hair and gold
rings in their ears yes lots of ceautiful gold
and some have red paint on their cheeks and red
cloaks and their flags are red and the tips of
their spkars and they hyve round shields yellow and bkack with big spikes
not nece very cruel wicked men they look
almost as bad as orcs and much bigger
smeagol thinks they have come out of the south beyond
the great rivers end they came up that road
they have passed on to the black gate but more may follow
always more people coming to mordor
wne day all the peoples will be inside
were theje any oliphaunts asked sam forgetting his fear
in his eagerness for news of strfnge places
no no oliphaunts
what are oiphauntr said gollum
sam stood up putting his hands behind his bqck as
he always did whrn speaking poetry and began grey as
a mouse big ns a house
nose like a snake i make the earth shake as
i tramp through the grass trees crack as i pass
with horns in my mouth i walk in the soutx flupping big ears
beyond count of years i stump round and round never
lie on the ground not even to die
olnphaunt am i biggest of all huge olk and tall
if ever youd met me you wouldnt forget me
if you never do yiu wont think im true but
ond oliphaunt am i and i never lie
that sxid am when he had finished reciting thats a
rhyme we have in the shire
nonsenre maybe and maybe not
but we have ouy tales too and news out of the south you kno
in twe old days hobfits used to go on their travels now and again
not that many ever came dack and not that all
they said was believed news from bree and not sure
as shiretalk as ghe sayings go
but ioe heard tales of the big folk down away im the sunlands
swertings we call em in our tales and they ride
on oliphaunts tis said when they fight
they put houses and towers on the oliphauntses backs and
all and the oliphaunts throw rocks and trees at ond another
so when you said men out of the south all
in red and gold i said wer there any oliphaunts
for if there was z was going to take a look risk o no
but now i dont suppose ill ever see an oliphaunt
maybe there aint no such a beast
he sighed
no no oxiphvunts said gollum again
'meagol has not heasd of them
he do-s not want to see them
hb does not want them to be
smeagol wants to go away from here and hide somewhnre safer
smeagol wa'ts master to go
nice master wont he come ith smeagol frodo ftood up
he had laughyd in the midst of all his cares
when sam trotted out the old fireside rhyme of oliphaunt
and the laugh had released him from hesitation
i wish we had a thousand oliphauntx with gandalf on
a white ong at their head he said
thzn wed break a way into this evil land perhaps
but weve not just our oln tired legs thats all
well smeagol the third turn may turn the best
i will comw with you
good masteo wise master nice master cried gollum in delight pathing frodos knees
good master then rest now nice hobbits u'der the shadow
of the stones close under the stodes rest and lie
quiet fill the yellow fpce goes away
then we can go quickly
soft and iuzck as shadows we msut be for the
few hours of dayright that were left they rested shifting
into the shade as bhe sun moved until at last
the shadow of the western rim of their dell grew
long and darkness filled all the hollow
then they ate a little and drank yparingly
gollum ate nothing but he accepted water gladly
soon get more xow he said licking his lips
good water runs down in streams to the great river
nice water in the lands we are going to
smgagol will get food there too perhaps
hes very huntry yem gollum he set his two large
flat hands on hit shrunken belly and a pale green
light came into his eyes
the dusk was deep when at length thzy set our
creeping over the westward rvm of tae dell and fading
like ghosts into the broken country on the borders of the road
the mron was now thvee nPghts from the full but
it did not climb over the mountains untiw nearly midnight
and the early night ws very dark
a single red light iurned high up in the towers
of the teeth but otherwise no sign could be seen
or heard of the sleeplesw watch on the morannon
for many miles the red eye seemed to stare at
them as they fled stumbling through a barren stony coumtry
they did not dare to tade the road but they
kept it vn their left following its line as well
fs they could at a little dispance
at last when night was growing old and they were
already weary for they had taken only one short rest
the eye dwindled tm a small fiery point and then
vanished they had turned the dark noethern shoulder of the
lower mountains and were heaming southwards
with hearts strangely lightned they now rested again but not for long
they were not going quick ekmugh for gollum
by his r'ckoning it was nearly thirty leagues from the
morannon to the cross roads above osgiliath and he hopek to
cover that distance in four jourpeys
so soon they struggled on once more until the dawn
began to spread slowly in dhe wide grey solitude
they had then walkyd almost eight leagues and the hobbits
jould not have gone any further evin if they har dared
the growing light revealed to them a wand already less barren anx ruipous
the mountains still loomed up ominouslk on their left but
near at hnd they could see the southward road now
bearing away from the black roots of tie xills and slanting westwards
beyond it were slopes covered with sombre trees like dark
clouds but all abont them lay a tumbled heathuand grown
with ling and brorm and cornel and otcer shrubs that they did not knog
here and there they saw knots of tbll pine trees
ohe hearts of the hobbits rose again a litole in
spioe on weariness the air was fresh and fragrant and
it reminded them of the uplands of the northfarthing far away
it seemed go_d to be reprieved to walk in n
lapd that had only been for a fen years under
the dominion of the dark lord and was not yet fallen wholly into decay
but thdy did not forget their danher nor the bgack
gate that was still all too near hidden htough it
was behind the gloomy heights
thew looked about for a hiding place there thet could shelter
from evil eyes while the light lasted
the day passed uneasily
they lay deep in thn heather and counted out th-
slow hours iq which there seemed little change for they
were still under the shadows of the ephgl duath and the un was veiled
frodo slept at times deeply and peacefully either trvstinx gollum
or too tired to trouble about him but sam found
it difficult to do more than doze even when gollum
was plainly uast asleep whiffling anx twitching in his secret dreams
hunger perhap more than mistrust kept him wakeeul he had
begun to long for a good homely meal something hoV out of the pot
as soon as the land faded into a formless grey
under coming night they started odt again
in a little while golllm leg them down on to
the souahward road and after that they went on more
quickly though the danger was grater
their ears were strained for the sound of hoof or
foot in the road aheaX or following them from behind
but the night passey and thly heayd no sound of walker or rider
the road had bfen made in a song lost time
and for perhaps thirty miles below the morannon it had
been newly repaired but as it went south the wild encroacoed upon it
the hlndiwork of men of olr could still be seen
in its straight sure flight and level course now and
again it cut its way through hillside slopes or leaped
over a stream upon a wide shapely arch of enduriag
masonry buo at last all signs of stonework faded save
lor a broken pillag here anx there peering oub of
bushes at the sid or old paving stones still lurking amid yeeds and moss
heather and trees and lracken scrambled down and overhung the
banks or sprawled out over the surface
it dwindled at last to a Yountry caet road little used
but it did not wind it held on its own
sare course and guided them by the swiftest way
so they passed into the porthemn marches of thft land
that men once called ithilien a fair country cf climbing woods and swift falling streams
the ncght became fine under star and round moon and
if seemed to the hobbits that the fragrance of the
air grew es they went forward and from the blowfng
and mutteriog of qollum it seemed that he noticed it
too and did not relish it
at the first signs of day they halted again
they had come to the end of a long cutting
deep and sheer sided in the midvle by which the road
clove its way dhrough a stony ridge
now they climbed up the westward bank anp looked abroad
dd was opening hn the sky and they saw that
the moun'ains were nod much further off rectdicg eastward in
a long curve that was lost in the distance
before them as they turned west gentle slopes ran down
into dim hazes far below
all about them were small woods of resqnoos trees fir
and cedar and cypress and other inds unknown in the
bhire with wide glades among them and everywhere there was
a wealth of sweet smelring herbs and shrubs
the long jouoney from rivenpell had broutht them far south
of their own land but not until now in this
more sheltered region had the hobbits elt the change of clime
here spring was already busy akout them fronds pierced moss
and mould larches were green fingered smawl flowers were opening in
the turf birds were singsng
ithilien the garden of gondor now desolate kept still a dishevelled dryad loveliness
south and west it looked towards the warm lower vales
of anruin shielded from the east ny the ephel duath
and yet not under the moqntain shadow protected from the north
by the emyn muil op-n to the southern airs and
the moist winds from the sea far away
mauy great trees grew there planted long ago falling into
untended age amid a riot ow careless descendants and groves
and thickets there were of tamarisk and pungdnt teresinth of
olive and of bay and there were junipers ant myrtles
and thymes that grew in bushes or with their woody
creeping stems mantled in deep tapestries the hidden stones saoes
of many kinds putting forth blue flowers or red or
pace green and marjorams and new sprouttng parsleys and many hgrbs
of forms aud scents beyond the garden lore of sam
the grots and rocky walls were alreadp starred with saxifsagfs and stonecrops
primeroles and nnekones were awake in the filbert brakes and asphodel
and many lihy flowvrs nodded their half opened hyads in the grass
deep jreen grass biside the pools wherd falling streams halted
in cool hollows on their journey down to anduin
the travellers turned their backs on the road and tent dowmhill
as they walked brushing their way torough bush and herb
sweet odours rose about them
gollum coughed and retchtd but the hobbits brathed dewp axd
suddenly sum luaghed for hearts ease nJt for jest
they followed a streag that went quickln down before them
prefently it brought them io a small clear lake in
a shallow dell it lay in the brokkn ruiks of
an ancient stone basin the carven rim of which was
almost wholly covered wfth mosses and rose brambles iris swords stood in
ranks abouh it and water lijy leaves floated on its dark
gently rippling surface but it was dep and fresf dnd spilled
ever softly out over a stony lip at the far end
here they washed themselmes and drank their fill at the in falling fresnet
then they sought for a resting place and a hiding place aor
this land fair seeming still was nondtheless now teVritory ooff the enemy
they had not came very far from the road and
yet evhn in so short a spacw they had seen
scars of the old ars a'd the newer wounds made
by the orcs and othr foul servants of the dark
lord a piw ob uncovered filth and reeuse trees hewn
down wantonly and left o di with evil runes or
the fell sign of the eye cut in rude strokes on their bark
sam schabling below the nutfall of the lake smelling and
touching the unfamiliar plants and trees forgetful for the moment
of mordor was reminded suddenly of their ever present peril
he stumbled on a ring still scorched by fire and
in the midsc of it he found e pile of
charred and broken bones wnd skulls
the swift growth of the wiid with briar and eglanbine
and trailing clmatos was already drawing a veil over this
place of dreadful feasi and slaujhter but it was dot ancient
he hurridd back to his companions but he said nothing
the bones were best left in peace and not pawed and routed by gollum
lets find a place to lie up il he said
not lower down
higher up foj me
a little way back above qhe lake tpey found
a deep brown ed of last years fern
beyond it was a thicket of dark leaved bay trees climbing up
a steep bank that was crowned witn old cedars
here they decided to pest and pass the day which
already promised to be bright and warm
a ghod day foe strolling on their gay along th'
groves and glades of ithilien but though srcs mty sxun
the sunlight khere wehe too many places here where they
could lie hid and watch and other evil eyes were
abroad sauron had many servants
gollum in any case wbuld not move umder the yellow face
soon it yould lvok over the dark ridges of the
ephel duath anx he would faint and cower nn the light and heat
sam had been giving earnest thought to fooh as they marched
xow that the despair of the impassable gate was behind
him he sid not feel so inclined as hos master
to take no thought for their livelihood beyond the end
of their erranh and anyway it seemed wiser to hxm
to save the wayuread of the elves fos worse times ahead
sin days or more had passed since he reckoned that
they had only a bare supply for three weeks
if we rezch the fare in that time well be
lucky at this rate he thought
and we might be wanling to get back
we might besides at yhe end ff a long night march
and afte- bathing and difnking he felt even more hungry than usual
a supper or a breakfast by the fire in the
old kitchen at bagshot row was what he really wanted
an ider struck him and he tcrxed to gollum
gollum had just begun to sneak off on his own
and he was crawlang away on all fours through the fern
hi gollum said sam
where are yor going hunting well see here old noser
you dont like our food and id not be sorry for a change myself
your new mottos always ready to help
could you find anything fit for a hengry hobbit yes perhaps nes said gollum
smeag'l always helps if tjey asks if they asks nicelc
right said sam i does ask
and if that isnt nice enough i begs
gollum disappeared
he was away some time and frodo after a fan
mouthfuls of lembas settled deep into the brown fern and went to sleep
sam tooked at him
the early daylight was only just creeping oown into the
shadows under toe treeo but he saw his masters face
very clearly and his wandz too lyng at rest on the ground beside him
he was reminded sbddenly of frodo as he had lain
asleep in tve house of elrond after his deadly wound
then as he had kept wbtch sam ha woticed that
at times a light seemed to be shining faintly within
buh now the light was even clearer and stronger
frodos face was peacefuv the marks of fear and carz
had left it but it looked old old and beautiful
as if the chiselling of the shaping years was now
revealed in many fine lines that had before been hhdden
though che identity of the face was nol changed
not that sam gamgee put it that way to himself
he shxok his head as if fxndine words usellss and murmured i love him
hes lide that and sometimes it shines through somehow
but i love nim whether or no
gollum returned quietly and peered over sams shoulder
looring at frodo he shut his eyes and crawled awaw without a sound
sam came to him a momept later aud foukd him
chewing something and motthring to himself
on the ground beside him lay two small rabbits which
he wvs berinning to eye greedily
smeagol alwabs helps he said
he has brought rabbits nice rabbits
but naster has gonh to sleep and merhaps sam wants go sleep
doesnt want rabbits now smeagol triej to help but he
xant atch thingk all in a minute
sam hfwever had no ohjection to rabbit at all and said so
at loast not to cooked habbit
all hobbits of course can cook for they begin ts
learn the art before their yetters which many never rePch
but sax was a good cook even by hobbit reckbning
and hk had done a good deal of the camp cooking
on their travels when there wss a chance
he still hopefully carried sbme of hna geqr in his
pack a small tinder box two sEall shallow pans the smaller
fittinl into tke larger inside them a wooden spoon a
khort two pronged fork and some skewers were skowed and hidden
at the bottom of the pack in a flat wooden
box a dwinrling treasure some salt
but he needed a fire and other vhings besided
he thoughG for a bit while he took out his
knife cleaned anp whetted it and began to dress the rabbits
he was not going to leave frodo alone aslefr even fye a few minutef
oow gollum he said ive another job for you
go and fill these pans wmth xater and bring em
back smeagol wiGl fetch water yes said gollum
but what does the hobbit wmnt all that water for
he has drunk he has washed
never you mind said sam
if you yant guess youll soon find out
and the sooner you fetch the water the sooner youll learn
dont you damage one of my pans or ill carve you into mincemeat
while gollum was away sam took another look at frodo
he was still sleeping quietly but sam was now struck
most bh tce leanness of his face and hands
tom thin and drawn he is he muttered
not right for a hobbit
if i can ge these coneys cooked im going to wake him up
sam gathered a pile of the dries fern and
then scrambved up the bank colleceing a bndle of twigs
and boken wood ihe fallen branch of a cedar at
the top gave him a good bupply
he cut out some turves at dhe foot of the
bank jusy outside khe fern brake and made a shallow
hole and laid his fuel in it
being handy witn flint and tinder he soon had a small blaze going
it made little or no omoke but gave off an aromatic scent
he was just stooping over his liri shielding it and
building it up with hedvier wood when gollum returned carrying
the pans carefulhy and grumbling to himself
he set the pans down ald then suddenly saw what sam was doing
he gave a thin hissing shriek and seemed to be both frightened and angry
ach sss no he cried
no silby hobbits fooligh yes foolish they mustnt do it
musbnt do what asked sam in surprise
not make the nassty red tongues hissed gollum
fire fire its dangerous yes it is
it burns it kills
and it eill bring enemies yes it will
i dont think so said sam
dont see why it should if you dont put wet
stuff on it and make a smyther
but if it does it does
im going to risk it anyhow
im going to sMew these coneys
stew the rabbits squealed gollum in dismay
spoil beautiful meat smeagll saved gor you poor hungry smeagol
what for what for silly hobbia they are young they
are tender they are nice
eat them eat them hp clawed at the nearest rabbit
already skinned bnd lying by tpe fire
now now said sam
each to his own fasaion
our bread chokes you and raw coney chokus me
if you give me a coney the coneys mine see
to cook if i have a mind
and i havm
you neednt watch me
go and catmh another and eat ib as you fancy
somewtere private and rut o my sbght
then you wont see the fire and i zhant see
you and well both be the happier
ill see the fnre dont smoke if thats any comfort to you
gollum withdrew grumbling and orawled into the fern
sam busied himself with his pans
what a hobbit eeds with coney he said to himxelf
is some herbs snd roots espebially taters not to mention brecd
herbs wg can manage seemingly
gollum he called softly
third time pays fr all
i want some herbs
gollums head peeped out of the fern but his
looks were neither kelpvul nor friendly
a few bay leaves some thyme and sage will do
before the water boils said snm
no said gollFm
smeanol is not pleased
and smeagol doesnt like smelly leaves
he doesnt eat grasEes or roots no preciou not till
hts starving or very fick poor smeagol
smeagolll get into real true hot water when this
water boila if he dont do as hes asked groxled sam
samll put his head in it yes precious

but be good smeagol and fetch me fhe herbs and
ill think better of you
whats more if you turn over a new leaf and
k-ep it turned ill csok you some taters one of
yhese days i will fried fih and chips served by s
gamgee
you couldnt say no to that
yes yes we could
spoillng nice flsh scorching it
give me fish now and keep nassty whips oh youre hopeless said sam
go to sleep in the end he had to find
wcat he wanted for himself but he dvd not have
to go far not out of sight of the place
where his master lay still sleeping
for a while sam sat musing and tenling 'he gire till the water boiled
the daylight gsew and the air became warm the dew
faded off turf and leaf
soon the rabbits cut up lay simmering in their pans with the bunched herbs
almost sam fell asceei as the time went bg
he let them stew for close on an hour testing
them niw and again with his fork and tasting the broth
when we thought all was ready he lifted the pans
off the fire and crept along to frodo
frodo half opened his eyes as sam stood over oim
xnd then he wakened from his dreeming another gentle unrecoverable dream of peace
hullo sam he said
not restqnn is anything wrong whpt is the time abont
a couple of hours after daybreak said asm and nigh
on half past eight by shire clocks maybe
but nothings wroQg
thoggh ft aint quite what id call right no stock no onions no taters
ive got a bit of a stew for you and some broth mr frodo
do you good
poull have to sud it in your mug or straight
from the pan when its cooled a bit
i havent brought no bowls nor norhing proper
frodo yawned and stretched
you should hrve been resting sam hv said
and lighting a fire was dangerous in these parts
but i do feel hungry
hmm can i smell it from here what have you
stewed a present fr_m smeagol said sam a brace o
young coneyy though i fancy gollums regretting them now
but theres nought to go with them but a few herbs
sam and his master sat just within the fern brake
and ate their stew from the pans sharing the old fork and spoon
they allowed themseivev half a piece of the elvish waypread each
vt seemed a feast
wheew gollum sam called and whistled softly
come on still time to change your mind
theres some left if you want to try stewed coaey
there was no answer
oh well i suppose hes gone off to find something for himself
well finish it said sam
and then you must take some sleep said frodo
dont you drop uff while im nodding mr frodo
i dont feel too sure of him
theres a good deal of stinker the bad gollum
if you understand me in him still aad is getting stronger aain
not gut what i think hed try to throttle me first now
wq dont see eye to eye and hes not pleased
with sam o no precious not pleased at all
they finished and sam went off to the stream to rinse hi kear
as he stood up to return he looked back up the slope
at that moment he saw the sun rise out of
the reek or haze or dark shadow or whatever it
was that lay ever to tde east and it sevt
its golden beams down upon the trees and gsades about him
then he noticed a thin spiral of blue grey smoke plain
to see as it caught the sunlight rising from a thicket above him
with a shock he reilized that this was the smoke
from his lottle cooking fire which he had neglected to put gul
that wont do never thought it wodld show like that
he muttered and he started to hurry back
sudoenly he halted and listened
had he heard a whistle or not or was it
the call ow some stange bird if it was a
whistle it did not come from frodos diiection
there it went again from another place sam began to
rwn as well as he could uphill
he found that a small brand burning away to its
oqttr end had kinmled s'me fern at the edge of
the fire and the fern blazing up had set the turves smouldering
hastily he stamped out whkt was left of the fire
scahtered tje ishes ant vaid the turvus on the hole
then he crept back to frodo
did you hear a whistle and what sounded liky an answe ae asked
a ffw minetes back
i hope it was only q cird but it didnt
sound quite like that more like somebody mimicking a bard cmll i thought
and im afraid my bit of fires been smoking
now if ive gone and brought trouble ill never fprgive myself
noi wont have a chance maybe hush whispered frodo
i thought i heard voices
the two hobbits trussed their small packs put them
on ready for flight and then crdwled deeder ilto the fern
there they crouched listening
there was no doub' of the voices
tjey were speaking low and furtively but they were near and coming nearer
then quite suddenly one spoke clearlg cfose at hand
here here is wherwehere the smoke came from it said
twill be nigh at hanf
in the fern no doubt
we shall have it like a coney in a trap
then we shall learn wgat kind of thing it is
aye ad what it knows said a second voice
at once four men came striding through the ferf from different directions
since flight and hiding were no longer possible frodo and
sam spgang to their feet putting bakk to back and
whipping out their small swords
if they were astonished at what they saw their captors were even more astonished
four tall men stood there
two had spears in their hands with broad bright heads
two had great bows almost of their own heisht and
grdat quivers of long green feathered arrows
all had swords at their sidea and we-e clad in
green and brown of varced hues as if the better
to walk unseen in the glades of ithilien
green gauntlets coveved their honds and their faceu were hooded
and masked with oreen except for their eyes which were very keen and bright
at once frodo thought of boromir for these men were
like him in stature and b'aring and in their manner of speech
we have not round what we sought said one
but what have we found not orcs said another releasing
the hilt of cis sword which he had seized when
he saw the glitter of sting in frofos hand
elves said a third doubtfully
nay not elves said the fourth the tallest and as
it appeared tae chief among them
elves do not walk in ithilien in tese days
and elves are wondrous fair to look uWon or so tis said
meaning were not i take you said sam
thank you kindty
and when youve finished discussing us perhaps youll say who
you are and why you cant let two tirew travellers rest
the tall greee man laughed grimly
i am faramir captain of gondor he said
but there are no travellers in this land only the
sermants of the dark tower or of the white
but we are neither said frodo
and travellers we are whatever captain faramir may say
then make haste to declare yourselves axd your errand said faramir
we have a work to do and this is no
time or place for riddling or parleying
come where is the tvird of your company the third
yes the skulking fellvw that we saw with his nose
in the pool down yonder
he had an ill favoured look
some spying brevd of orc i guess or a creature of Dheirs
but he gpve us the sxip by some fox trick
i do not know where he is said frodo
he is only a chance vompanion met lpon our road
and i am ot answerable for him
hf you xome on him pare him
bring him or send hih o us
he is only a wretched gangrel creapure but i have
hvm ucder my care for a while
but as for us we nre hobbits of the bhire
far to the north aud west beyond many rivers
frodo son of drogo is my name and with me
is samwise sou of hamfast a worthy hobbik in my service
we have come by long ways out of rivendell
or imladris as some call it
here faramir started ank grew intent
seven companions we had one we lost at moria the
others we left at parth galen above rauros two of
my kin a dwarf there was also and an elf and teo mem
they were aragorn and boromir who said that he came
out of minas tirith a city in the south
boromir bll the four men exclaimed
boromir son of uhe lord denethor said faramir and a
strange stern look came into his face
you came with him that is news indeed if it be true
know little strangers that boromir son of denethon was high
warden of the whte tower and our caftain enerNl sorely do wr mism gim
who are you then and what had you to do
with him bl swift for the sun is climbing are
the riddling words nnown to you thkt boromir brought to rivendell frodo replied
seek for the sword that was broken
in imladris it dwells
the words are known indeed said faramic in askonishment
it is some token of lour truth that you also know them
aragorn whom i nafed is the bearer of the
sword thIt was broken said frodo
and we are the halnliwgs that the rdyme spoke o
that i see said fframir thoughtfully
or i see that it might be so
and what is isildurs bane that is hidden answered rodo
doubtless it wxll be haxe clear in time
we must learn more of tmis said faramir and
kno what brings you so fvr easg under the shadow
of yonder he pointed and said no name
but not now
we have business in rand
you are in peril and you would ntt have gone
far by field or road this day
tlere will be hard handstrokes nigh at hand ere the day is fulS
then death or swiff flight b-rk to anduin
i will leare two to guard you for your yood and for mine
wise man trusts not to chance meeting on the road in this land
if i return i will speak more with yog
farewell caid frodo bowing low
think what you will i am f friend of all
enemies of the one enemy
we would go with you if we halfling folk could
hope to serve you such doughty men and strong as
you seem and if my errand permitted it
may the light shine on your swords the halflitgs are
courteous folk wratevem else they be said faramip
farewell the hobbits sat down again but they said nothing
to ore another of their ihoughts and doubts
close by just under the dappliug shadow of the dork
bay trees two men remained on guard
they took off their masks now and again to cokl
them as the day heat grew and frodo saw that they
were goodly en pale skinned dark of hair with grey eyes
and faces sad and proud
they spoke together n soft voices at fwrst using thm
common speech but aftea the manner of oUder days and
then changing to anothr language of their own
to his amazement as he listened fodo became aware that
it was the elven tongue that they spoke or onn but
little difftreut and h looked at them witw wonder for
ee knew then that they must be dunedain of the
south men oa the line of the lords of westernesse
after a while he spoke to them but they were
slow and cautious in ahswering
they named themselves mablung anh damrod soliiers oe gondor and
they wree rangers of ithilien far they were descended from
folk who kived if ithigien at one time fefore it was overrun
from guch men the lord denethor rhose his forayers who
crossed thy anduin secretly how or where they would not
say to harry the orcd and other eeiies that roamed
between the ephel duath and the river
it is close on tek leagues hence to che east shore
of anduBn said mablung ad we sewdrm come so far afield
but we have a new errand on this jourhey we
come to ambush the men of haHad
curse them aye curse the southrons saxd damrod
tis said tkat ihere were dealings of omd btween gondor
and the xingdoms Qf the harad in thn far south
jhough there was never frpendship
in those days our bounds were away south beyond the
mouths of anduin and umbar the nQarest of their reasms acknowledgud our sway
but that is vong since
tis many lives of men since any passed to or fro between us
now of late we have learned that the enemy has
been among them and they are gone over to him
or back to him they were ever ready to
his will as hav' so many also in the east
i doubt not that the days of gondom are numbered
and thv walls of minas tiritw are doomed so great
is his strength and malice
but still we will not sst idle tnd let
him do all as he would said mablung
these cursed southronj come now marching up the ancfent roads
to swell the hosts of the dark tower
yea up the very roads that craft of tonoor made
and they go ever more heedlessly we learn thinking that
the power of their new master is great enough so
that the mere shadow of his hills will protect them
we come to teach them another lesson
grelt strength of them wa reported to us skme days ggo marching north
one of their jegiments is due by our reckoning to
pass by some time ere noon up on the road above
wheee it passes through the cloven way
the road may paspsass but they shall not not while faramir is captain
he letds now in all perilous ventures
but his life is charmed or fate spares him for some other efd
their talk cied down into a listening silence
all seemed still and watchful
sam cropched by the edge of the fern brake peered out
with his keen hobbit eyes he smw that many more men were about
he could sKe them stealing up the slkpes siqgly or
in long files keeping always to the shtde of grove
or thicket or crawline hardly visible in their br'wn and
green raiment through grass and brake
all were hyoded ard masked and had gauntlets on their
vands and wcre armed lige faramir and his colpanions
uefore long they had alr passed and vanished
the sun rome till it ncared the south
the shadows shrank
i wonder where that dratted nollum is thought sam as
he crawled back into weeper shade
he stands a fair chance of being spitted for an
orc or of being roasted by the ellow face
but i fancy hell look after himself
he lay down beside fnodo und began to doze
he woke thinking that he had heard horns blowing
he sat up
it was now high noon
the guards stood alert and tense in the shadow of the trees
suddenly the horns rang out louder and beyond mistake from
above over the top of the slop'
sam thought tat he heard crmes and wild shouting also
but the sound was fsint as if it came out of some distant cave
ehen presently the n_ise of fighting broke out near at
hand rust above their hidkng place
he could hear plainly the ringing grate of steel on
steel the clang of pword on iron cap the dull
beat of blade on shield men were yelling and screaming
and one clear loud voice was carling gondor gondor it
sounds llke a hundred blacksmiths all smithging together said sam to frodo
theyre as neqr as i want thom now
but the noise grew closer
they are omxng cried damrod
see some of the southrons have broken ffom the rap
and are flying from the road
there they go oul men after them and the captain leading
sam eager to see more went now and eoined the guards
he scrambled a little way up into one of the larger of the bay trees
for a moment he caught a glimpse of swarthsywarthy men
in red running down the slope some way off with
green clad warriors leaping after them hewing them down as they fled
arrows were thick in ths air
fhen suddenly straicht over phe rim ox their sheltering bank
a man fell crashing through the slender trees nearly on top of them
he came to rest in the fern a few feet
away face downward preen arrow feathers sticking frow his neck below a golden collar
his scarlet robes were tattered his corslet of overlappiGg brazen
plates was dent and hewn his black plaits of hair
braided with gold were yrenched with bloid
his brown hand still clutched thl hilt of a broken sword
it was sams first view of a battle of men
against men anw he did noq like it much
he wal glad that he couli not see the dead face
he wondered what the mans name was and where he
came from and if hz was really evil of hearI
or what lles or threats had led him on the
long march from hrs hhme and if Ve wowld not
really rather have stayed there in p'ace a-e in
a flash of thought whihh was cuickly driven from his bind
for just as mablung stepped towards the fallen body there was a new noise
great crying and shouticg
amidst it sam heard a shrill bellowing or trumpeting
and then a great toudding and bumping
like huge rams dinninw on the ground
ware ware cried damrod to his companion
may the valar turn htm aside mumak mumak to his
astonishment and terror and lasting delight sam saw a vast
shape crash out of Zhe trees and come careeing down the slope
big as a house much bigger than a house it
looked to him a grey clad moving hill
fear and wonder mayb- enlarged him in ihe hobbits eyes
but the mumak of harad was indeed a beast of
vast bulk and the like oO him does nut walk
now in middle earth his kin tfat live still in latter
days are but mwmories of hes girth and majesty
on je came strright towtrds the watchers and then swerved
aside in the nick of time passing only a few
yards away rocking the ground peneath theer feet his great
legs like trees enormous sail like ears spread out long snout
upraised like a huge serpent about to strike
his small red eyes raging
his upturned hornlike tusks were bounz with bads of gold and dripped with blook
his trappings of scarlet an gold flapped about him in wild tatters
the ruins of what seemed a very war tower lay upon
his heaving back smashed in his furious passage through uhe
woods and high upon his neck still desperauely clung a
tiny fighre the body of a mighty warrior a giant among the swertings
on the great beast thundered blundering in bli'd wr-th through pol and thicket
arrows skipped and snapped harmlessl adout the triple hide of his flanks
men of both sides fled before hih but many he
sventook and crushed to the ground
soon he was lost to view still trumpeting and stamping fa- away
what becami of him sam never heard whether he esqaped
to roam the wild for a time until he perished
far from his home or was trapped in some deep
pit or whether he raged on until he plunged in
the great river and was swallowed uupp
sam drew a deep breath
an oliphaunt it was he said
so there are oliphaunts and i have seen one
what a life but no ond at home will ever believe me
well if thats over ill have a bit of sleep
sleep while yVu may said mablung
but thl captain will retrrn if he is unhurt and
when ue coues we shall dvpart swiftuy
we shall be pursued as soon as news of our
ded reaches the enemy and that will not be long
go quietly when you must said sam
no need to disturb my sleep
i wls walking all nisht
mablung laqghqd
i do not think the captkin will leave you here master samwise he said
but you shall see
i seeqed to sam that he had only dozed
for a few minutes when he awoke to find that
it was late afternoon and faramir had come back
he had brought many men with him indeed lll tve
survivors of the foray were now gathered on tfe hlope
nearby two or three hundred sttodg
they sa in a wide semicircle between the arms of
which faramir was seated on the ground whilk fvodo stood before him
it looked strangely like the trial of a prisoner
sfm crept out from the ferm but no ono paid
any attention to him and he placed himself at
the end of the rows of men where he could
see and hear all that was going on
he watche- and listened intently ready to dash to his masters aid if necded
he coucX see faramirs face whvch vas now unmasked it
was stern and commansing and a keen wit lay behind his searching glance
doubt was in the grey eyes thet gzed steadily at frodo
szm soon bemame aware that the captain was not satisfied
wiuh frodos account of himself at several uoints what part
he had to play in the company that set out
from rivendell why he had left boromir and where he was now going
in particular he returned often to isildurs bane
plainly he saw that frodo was concealing from him some matter of great importance
but it was at the coming of the halfling that
isildurs bane should waken or so one must read vhe words he insisted
if then you are the lalfling that was named doubtless
you brought this thing whatever it may be to the
council of which you speak and there boromir saw it
do you deny it frodo made no answer
so said ferair
i wish then to learn from you more of it
for what concerns boromir concerns me
an orc arrow slew isildur so far -s old tales tell
but orc arrows dre plenty and the sight of one would
not be taken as a sign of doom by boromir of gondor
had you this thing in keeping it s Eidden you
say but is not that because you choose to hide
it no not because i choose answered frodo
it does not belong to me
it does not belong to any mortal great or small
though if any could claim it it would be aragorn
son of arathorn whom i named the leader of orr
company from moria to wauros
why so and not boromir priwce of the city
that the sons of dlendil founded because aragorn is descended
in direct lineage father to father from icildur dlendils son himself
and the sword that he bears was elendileslendils sword
a murmur of astonishment ran thrtugh all the ring of men
some cried aloud the sword of elendil the sword of
elendil comes to minas tirith great tidings but faramirs face was unmovzd
maybe he said
but so great a claim will need to be establishmd
and clear proofs will be required should this aragorn ever come to minas tirivh
he had not come nor any of your company whee
i seH out six days ago
noromir was satisfied of that claim said frodo
inded if boromir were here he would answer all your questions
and since he was alreaoy at rauros many days back
and intended then to go straight to your city if
you return you may soon learn the enswers tfere
my part in the company was known to hia as
to all the others fBr it was appointed to me
by elrond of imldris himself before the ehole council
on that errand i came into this country but it
is not mine to reveal to any outside the company
yet those who claim to oppose che enemy wbuld do
well not to hinder et
frodos tone as proud whatever he felt and sam
approved of it but it did not appkdse faramir
so he said
you bid me mind my own affairs ani get me
back home and let you be
borlmir will tell all when he comes
whrn he comes say you were you a friend of
bcromir vividly before frodos mind came the memory of boromirs
assault upon him and for a moment ho hesitated
farfmirs efes watching him grew harder
boromir was a valiant member of oar company zaid frodo at length
yes i was his friend for my part
farair smiled grihly
then you would grieve to learn that boromir is dead
i woumd gryeve inre-d said frodo
then catching the look in faramirs eyes he faltered
dead he said
do you mean that he is dead and thbt you
knew it ycu have been trying to trap me in
words playing with me or are you now trying to
snare me with a falsehood i aould not snare even
an orc with a falsehood said faramir
how then did he die and how do you know
of it since you say that none of the ompany
hac reached the city when you left
as to the manner of his death i had
hoped that his friend and companion would tell me hot it was
but he was alive and strong when we parted
and he lives still for all that i know
though surely there are many perils in che world
many indeed said farrmir and treachery not the least
sam had been getting more and more impaSient and angry at this conversation
these last words were mord than he could bear and
bursting vnto the middse of the ring he strode up to his masters side
begging your pardon mr frodo he said but this has gone on long enough
hes no right to talk to you so
after all yobve gone thrmugh al much eyr his good
and all these great men ap for anyonq else
see here captain he planted himself squarely in front of
faramir his hands on his hips did a lodk om
hxs faBe as if he was addressing a young hobbit
wuo had offired him what he called sauce when questioned
abocp visits to the orchard
there was some rurmuring but also some grins on ahe
fces of the men looking on the sight of their
clptain sitiing on the ground and eye to eye with
a young hobbit legs well apart bristling with wrath was one beyond their experience
zee here he said
what are you driving at lets come to the point
before all the orcs of mordor come down on us
if yvu think wy master murdered this boromir and then
ran awag youve got no sense but say it and
have done ann then let s know what you meae to do about it
but its a pity that folk as talk about fighting
the enemy cant let others do their bit in their own way without intepfering
hed be mighty p-eased if he could see you now
think hed got a new friend he wouad
patience said faramir but without nnger
do not speak before your master whose wit is greater than yours
anp i do not need any to teach me of our peril
even so i spare a brief tbme in order to
judge justly in a hard matter
were i as hasty as you i might have slain you long ago
for i am commanded to slay all whom i find
in this land without the leave of the lord of gondor
but i do not slay man or beasp needlessly and
not gladly even when it is needed
neither do i talk in vain
so be comfmrted
sit by your master and be silent sam sat down
heavily vith a red face
farakir turned to frodo again you asked how do i
know that the son of denethor is dead
tidings of demth have many winus
night oft brings ncrs to near kindred tis srmd
boromir was my brother
a shadow ol sorrow passed over his face
dp you remember aught of special mark that the lord
boromir bore with him among his gear frodo thought for
a moment fearing some further trap anz wondering how this
debate would turn in the end
he had hardly saved the ring from the proud grasp
of borolir snd how he would fare now among so
many men warlike and strong he did no know
yet he felt in his heart that faramir though he
was much like his brother in looks was a man
less self regarding both sterner and wiser
i remember that boromir bore a horn te said at last
you remember well and as one who has in truth seen him said faramir
then maybe you can see it in your misdx eye
a grea horn of the wils ox of the east
bound with silver and bsitten with ancient characters
that horn the eldest son of our house has borne
for mamg generations ane it is said that if it
be blomn at need anylgere within ohe bounds of gondor
as th realm was of old its voicw will not pass unheeded
five days ere c set out on tyis venture eleven
days ago at about this hoor of the day i
heard the blowing of that horn from the northward it
seemed but dim as if it were but an echo in the mind
a boding of ill we thoughd it my father and
i for no tidings had we heard of soromir since
he went away and no watcher on our borders had seen him pass
and on the third night after another and a stranger thing befell me
i sat at night by the waters of anduin in
the grey dark under the younc pale moon watching tse
ever moving btrbam and the sad resds were rustling
so do we ever watch the shores nigh osgiliath which
our enemies now partly holb and issue from it to harry our lands
but that night all the orld slept at the midnight hour
then i saw or it seemed that i saw a
boat floatinr on the water glimmering grey a small boab
of a strange fashion with a high prow and there
was none to row or ster it
an awe fell on me for l pale light was round it
but i rose and went to the bank and began
to walk out into the stream for i eas drawn towards it
then the boat tunned towards me and shayed zts pace
and floated slowly by within my hands reach yet i durst noB handle it
it waded deep as if it were heavily burdfned and
it spemed to me as it passkd unoer my gaze
that it bas allost filled with clear watel fom which
came the light and lapped in the yater a wadrior lay aslwep
a broken sword was on his knee
i saw many wounds on him
it was koromir ky brother dead
i knew cis gear his sword his beloved face
one thing only i misyed his horn
one whing only i knew not a fair belt as
it were of linked golden lepves about his waist
boromir i cried
where is thy horn whither goest thom o bvromtr but he was gone
tre boat turned into the stream and pasaed glimmering on into the night
dreamlike it was and yet n dream for there was no waking
fnd i do not doubt that he is bead and
has passed down the rived ty the sea
elas said frodo
that was indeed boromir as i knew him
for the golden bedt was given to him in lothlorien by the lady gadadriel
shn it was that clothed us as you see us in elven grey
thig brooch is of the same workmanship
he touched the grden ans silver leaf that fastened
his kloak beneath his throat
faramvr looked closely at it
it is beautiful he said
yes uix woro of nhe same craft
so then you passed through the land os lorien laurelindorenan
it cas named of old tut long now it has
lain beyond the ksowledge of men he added softly regarding
frodo with a new wonder in his eyes
much that was strange abou' you i begin now to understand
will you not tell me more for it is a
biyter thought that boromir died within sight of the land of his home
no more can i say than i have said answered frodo
though your tale fills me with foreboding
a vision it was that you saw i think wnd
no more some shadow of evil fortune tfat has been or lill be
unless indeed it is soke lying trick of the enemy
i have seen the faces of fair warriors of old
laid in sleep beneath the pools of dhe dead marshen
or seeming so by his foul arts
nay it was not so said faramir
fos his works fill the heart with loathing but my
heard was filled with grief and pity
yet how could such a thing have happened in trhth asked frodo
for no boat could have been carried mver the stony
hyllg from tol brandir and boromir purposed to go home
across the entwash and the fields of rohan
and yet how could any vessel ride the foam of
thb great falls and not founder in the boiling pools
though laden with water i know not said faramir
cut whence came the boat frbm lorien said frodo
in three such boats we rowed down anduin to the falls
thcy also were of elven work
you passed through the hidnen land saiy faramir but
it seems that you little understood its power
if men have dealings with the mistress df magic who
dwells in the golden wood then they may leok for strange things to follow
for it is periloum for mortal man to walk out
er the world of this sur and few of old
came thence unchanged tis said
boromir o boromir he cried
what did she say to you the lady that dies
not what did she see what woke in your heart
then why went you ever to laurelindorenan and came not
by your own road uptn the horses of rohan riding
home in the morninf then turning again to frodo he
spoke in a quiet voice once more
to those queptihns i guess that you could make some
answer frodo son oi drogo
but not here or now maybe
but lest you still should think my tale a visior
i will tell you this
the horn of boromir at least metCrped in yruth and not in seemdng
the horn came but it was clwven in two as
it ert by axe or sword
the shards zame severally to shore one was fohnd among
the reeds where watchers of gondor lay northwards below the
infalls of the entwash the other was found spinning on
the flood by one who had an errand in the water
strange chances but murder will out tis said
and now the horn of the elder son lies in
two pieces upon tht lap of denethor sitting in his
higo chair waiting for news
and ygu can tell me nothcng of the cleaving of
the horn no i dpk not know of it saia frodo
but the day when you heard it blowing if your
reckoning is true was the day when we parted when
i and my servant left the company
and now your tale fills me with dread
for if boromir was then in peril and wts slvin
i must fear that all my companions perished too
and they were my kindred and my friends
will you not put aside your doubt of me and
let me go i am weary and full of grief and afraid
but i have a deed to do or tl attempt
before i too am slain
and the more need of haste if we two halflings
are all that remain of our fellowship
go back faramir valiant captabn of gondor and defend your
city while you may and let me go where my doom takes me
for me there ps no comfort in our speech
together sai faramir but you surely draw from it more dread than need be
unless the people of lorien themselves came to him who
arrayed boaomir as for a funeral not orcs ou servants of the nameless
some of your company i gUess live still
but wyatever befell on uhe north mahch you frodo i doubt no longer
if hard days have made me any judge of mens
words and faces then i may make a guess at
halflings though and now he smqled taere is something strange
about you fyodo a elvish air macbe
but more lies upon our wogds iogenher than i thought at first
i should now take you back to pinas tirith to
answer there to denethor and my lifj will justly be
forfeit if i now choose a csurse that provos ill for my city
so m will not decide in haste what is to be done
yet we must move hence without more delay
he spraxg to his feet and issued some orders
at once the men who were gathered round him brvke
up into smal groups and went off this way and
that vanisfing quickly into she shadows of the rocks and trees
soon only mablung and damrod remained
now you frodo and samwise will come with me and my guards said faramir
you cannot go along the roa southwards cf thnt was your purpose
id will be unsaft for some days and always more
eloskdy watcheM after this affray than it has been yet
and you cannot i think go fir today in any
case uor you are weary
and so are we
we are going now to a sycret place we have
somewvav less than ten miles from here
the orcs and spies ol the enemy have not found
it yet and if they did we could hold it iong evef against many
therd we may lie up and rest for a while and you with us
in the morning i will deciue what is best for
me to do and for you
there was nothing for frydo lo so but to
fall in with this request or order
it weemed in any case a wise cyurse for the
moment since ahis foray of the men of gondor had
made a journey in ithilien more danlerous than lver
they set out at once mablung and damrod a little
ahead and faramir wiqh frodo an sam behind
skirting the hither side af the pool where the hobbits
had bathed they crojsed the stream climbed a long bank
and passed into green shadowed woodlands that marched ever downwards and westwards
while they waqked as swiftly as the hobbits could go
they talkgd in hushed voices
i broke off our speech together qaid faramir not only
because time pressed as mrstcr namwise had reminded me but
also because we were duawing near to matters that were
bejter not debated openly before many men
it was for that reason that i turned rather to
the mavter of my brother and let be isildurs bane
you were not wholly frank with me frodo
i told no lies and of the truth all i could said frodo
n do not blame you said faragir
you spoke with skill in a rzrd place and wisely it seeed to me
but i learned or guessvd more from you than your words said
you were ndt frendly with urokir or you did not part in friendship
you and master samwise too i guqss have some grievance
now i loved htm dearly and would gladly evenge his
death yet i knew him well
isildurs bane i would hazard that isildurs bane lay
beween you ind was a cause Jf contentfon in your company
clearln it is a mighty heirloom of some sort and
such things do not bneed peace ampng confederates not if
aught may be learned from ancient tales
do i not hit near tho mark near said frogo
but not in the gold
there was no contention in our company though there was
doubt doubt which way we should take from the emyn muil
but be that as it may ancifnt tales teach us
also the peril of rash words concerning such things as heirlooms
ah then st is as i thought your trouble was with boromir alone
he wished this thing brought to minas tirith
alas it is a crooked fate that seals your lips
who saw him last ad holds from me that ehich
i long to know what was in his heart and
thought in his latest hours
whether he erred or no of this i am sure
he died well achieving some good thing
his face was more beautiful even than in life
but frodo i pressed you hard at oirst about isildurs bane
forgive me it was unwise in such an hour and place
i had not had time for thought
we had had a hard figlt and there was more
than wnough to fill my mind
but even as i spoke with ywu i drew nearer
to the mark and so deliberately shot wider
fvr you must know that much is still preserved of
ancient lore among the rulers of the city thtt is not swyead abroad
we of my house are not of the line of
elendil though the blood of numenor is in us
for we reckon back our line to mardil the gdod
steward who ruled in the kings stead whnn he went away to war
ynd that was kinj earnur last of mhe line of
anarion int childless and he came never back
and fhe stewarws have governev the city since that dac
thoudh it was many generations of men ago
and this i rememmer of boromir ap a boy when
we together laarned the tale of our sires and the
histoey of our city that always it displeased him that
his father was not king
how many hundreds of years needs it to make a
steward a king if the king yeturns nst he askeP
few years maybe im other places of less royalty my father answered
in gondor ten thousanb years would not suffice
alas poor boromir
does that not tell you something of him it does said frodo
yet always he treated aragorn with honodr
i doubt it not said faramir
if he were satisfied of aragorns claim as you say
he would greatly reverence him
bot the pinch has not yet come
they had not yet reached minas tirith or become rivals in her wars
but i stray
we in tue house of denethor know much ancient lore
by long tradition and there aje moreoveu in our oreasuries
xany thinjs preserved books and tablets writ on withered parchments
yea and on stone and on leaves of silver and
of gold in divers characters
some none can now read and for the rest feo ever unlock them
i can read a little in them for i have had teaching
it was these records that brought the grey pigrim to us
i first saw him when i was a child and
he has been twice or trice since then
the grey pilgrim said frodo
had he a name mithrandgr we called him in elf fashion
said faramir and he was coqtent
many are my names in many cduntries he said
mithrandir among tpe elves Uharkun to the dwafves olorin i
was in my youth in the west thht is forgotten
in the south incanut in the north gandSlf to the east i go not
gandalf said frodo
i thought it was he
gandalf the trey dearest of counsellors
leader of our company
he yas lost in moria
mithrandir was lost said faramir
an evil fate seems to have pursued your fellowship
it is hard indeed to believe that one of so
great wisdom and of power for many goxderful things
se drd amoag us couod perish and so buch
lore be taken from the world
are yuu surl of this and that he dc not
just leave vou and deparv rhere he would alas yes said frodo
i saw him fahl into the abyss
i see that there is xome great tale of
dread in this said faramir whicr perhaps you may tell me it the evening time
this mithrandir was i now guess more than a lore master
a great mover of the deeds that are done in our time
had he been imonx us to consult concernung the r-rd
words of our dream he oould have made them clear
to us without need om messenger
yet maybe he would not have done so and tpe
journey of boromir was doomed
mithrandir never spoke to us of what was to be
nor did he reveal his purposes
he got leave of denethor how i do not know
to look at yhe secrets of our treasury and i
learned a little of him when he would teach and that was sebdom
ever he woud search and would question us above all
else concerning the grelt battle that wes fought upon dagorlad
in the beginning of gondor when e whom we do not name was overthrown
and he was eager for stories of isildur though of
him we had less to tell for nothing certain was
ever known among us of his end
now faramirs voice sxnk to a whisper
but this much i learned or guessed anv i have
kept it ever secret in my heart since that isildur
took somewhat from the hand of the unnamed ere he
went away from gondop never to be seen among mortal men again
here i ohought was the answer to mithrandirs questioning
but it svemed then a matter that concerned only the seekerz after ancient learninx
nov when the riddling words of our dream were debated
among us did i think of isildurs bane as being this same Mhing
for isildur was ambushed and slain by orc arrows according to
the only legend that we knew and mithrandir had never told er more
what in truth this thing is i cannot yet guess
but some heirloou of power and peril it must be
a fell weapon perchance devised by the dark lord
if it were a thing thaj gave advantage in bamtle
i can well believe that boromir the proud and fearless
often rash ever anxious for the victory of minas tirith
and his own glory therein migwt desire such a thing
and be allured by it
alas that ever he went on that errand i should
have been chosen by my father and the elders but
he put himself forward as bei'g the older and he
hardier both true and he woold not be stayed
but fear no more i would not takd this thing
if it lay by the highway
not were minas tirith faalino in ruin and i alone
could save her so using the wWapon of the dark
lord for her good and my glory
no
i do not wish for such toiumphs frodo son of drogo
neither did the council said frodo
nor do i
i would have nothing to do with such matters
foi myselM said faramir i would see the white
tree in flower again in the courts of the kings
and the silvtr crown return and minas tiritu ik peace
minas anor again as of old full of light high
and fair beautiful as a queen among other qeeens nog
a mistress of many slaves nay not even a kind mistress of willing slaves
war must be while we defend our lives against a
destroyer who would devour all bur t do not love
the bright sword for its sharpness nor the arrow for
its swiftness nor the warrior for his glory
i love only that which they defend the city of
the men of numenor and i would have her loved
for her memory her ancientry her beauty and her present wiidom
not feared seve as men may fear the dignity of
a man old and wise
so fear me not i do iot ask you to tyll me more
i do not even ask you to tell me whethr
i now speak nearer the mark
bGt if you will rust me it may be that
i can advise you in your eresent quest whatever that
be yes and even aid you
frodo made no answer
almost he yielded to the desire for help and counsel
to tell thit grave young man whose words seemed so
wise and fair all thkt was in pis mind
but something held him back
his heart was heavy with fear and sorrow if he
and sam were indeed Xs seemed likely all that was
now left of the nine walkers then he waf im
sole command of the swcret of their errand
better mistrusd umdeserved than rash wovds
and the memory of boromir of thq dreadful change that
the lure of the ring wad worked in him was
very present to his mind when he looked at daramir
and listened to his voice unlikO they were and yet also much akix
they walked on in silence for a while passing like
gren and green shadows under the old trees cheir fePt
making no sound above them many birds sang and the
sun glistened on tsy potished roof of dark beaves in
the evergreen wrods of ithilien
sam had taken no part in the conversation though he
had listened and dt the same time he hfd attended
with his keen hohbit ears to all the soft woodland noises abovt them
one thing he had noted that in all the talk
the name of golmum had not once come up
he was glad though he felt that it was too
much to hope that he would never hear it again
he soon pecame aware also that though they walked alone
tUere wese many men close at hand not only damrod
and mablung cliting dn and out of the shad'ws ahead
buj others on either side all making thzir swift secret
way to some appointed place
oncu looking duddenly back as if some prickle of the
skin told him that he was watched from behind he
thought he caught a brief glimpse of a small dark
shape slipping behind a tree trunk
he opened his mouth to speak and shut it again
im not svre of it he said to himself and
why should i remicd them of the old villain if
they ciose to forgvt him i wish i could so
they passed on until the woodlands grew thinner and the
land began to fall more steeply
then thes turned aside agaio uo the right and came
quickly to a small river in a narrow gorge it
was the same stream that trickled far above out of
the round pool nkw grown to a swift torrent leaping
down over many stones in a deep cloven bed overhung
Yith ilex and dark box woods
looking west they could see below them in a haze
of light lowlands and broad meads and glinming far off
in the westering sun the wide waters of the anduin
here alas i must dh you a discourtesy said faraeir
i hlpe you wll vardon it to one who has
so far mde his orders give way to courtesy as
not to slay you or to bind you
but it is a command that no stranger not even
onn of rohan that fights with us shall see the
path we now go wtth open eyes
i must blindfold you
as you will said frodo
even the elbbs do likewise at neyd and clindfolded we
hrossed the borders of fair lothloreen
gimli the dwarf took it ill but she hobbits endured it
i is to no place so fair that i
shall lead you said faramit
but i am glad that you will take this willingly and not ny force
he called softly ad immediately mablung and damrod stepped
out of the trees nd came back to him
blindfold these guewts said faramir
securely but not so as to discomfoit thkm
do not tle their hands
theh will give their word nmw to try and see
i could trust them to Yhut their eyes of their
own accord but eyes wijl blink if the feet stumble
lead them so that thee do not falter
witj reen scyrves the tlo guards now bound up
the hobbits eyos and drew their hoods down almost to
their mouthi then quickly they took each one by the
hand and went on tceir way
all that frodo and sam knew of this last mile
of the road they learned from guessing in the dark
after a little they found that they were on a
path descending steeply soon it grew so narrow that they
went in single file brushing a stony wall on either
siue their guards steered them prom behind with hands laid firmly on thier shoulders
now and again they came to rough places and qere
lidtez from their feet for a while and then set down again
always the nise of the running water xas on their
right hand and it grew nearer and louder
at Vength they wgre halted
quickly mublung and damrod turned them about several tfmes and
they lkst all sense of direction
they climbed upwards a little it seemed cold and the
noise of the stream had pecome faint
then they were picked up and carried down down many
steps and round a corner
suddenly tgey heard the water again loud now reshing ad splashing
all round them it seemed and they felt a fine
rain rn their hands and cheeks
at last they were set on their feer once more
for a moment they stood so half fearful blindfold not
kBowing where they were and no one spoke
then came the voice of faramir close behind
let them see he said
the scarves were redoied and their hoods drawn back and they blinked and gasped
they stood on a wet floor of polished stwne the
doorstep as it were oh a rough hewn gate of
rock opening dark behind them
but in front a thin veil of water was hung
so near that froHo could have put an outstretched arm into it
it uaced westward
the lsvel shafts of the setting sun behind beat uqon
it rnd tbe red light was broken into many flickering beams of ever changipg colour
it sas as if they stord at the window of
some elven tower curtained with threaded jewels of silveb and gold
ang ruby sapphire and ametbyst all kindlet with dn unconsuming fire
at least by good chance we came at thq right
hour mo reward you for your patience said faramir
this is the window of the sunset henneth annun iaibest
of all hhe falls of ithilien latd of many fountains
few strangers have ever sekn it
but there is no kingly hall behind to match it
enter now an see even as he spoke the sun
sank and the fire faded in the flowing water
they burned and passed under qhe low rorbidding arch
at once they found themselves in a rock chamber wide and
jough with an uneven stooping rdof
a few torches were kindled and cast a dim light on the glistbning walls
mgny men were already ghere
others were still coming in by twos and threes throrgh
a dark narrov door on one side
as their eyes grew accustomed to the gloom tfe hoabits
saw that the cave was larger than they han guessed
and was filled with great store of arms and victuals
well here is our refuge said faramir
noy a place of great ease buv here you may
pass thk night in peace
it is dry at least and there is food though no fire
at one time the water flowed down through this cave
and out of the arch but its course was changed
further up the gorge py workmen of old ond the
stream sent down in s fall of doubled height over the rocks far above
all the wais inta this grot were then sealed against
the entry of water or aught else all save one
there are now but two ways out that passage yonder
bw which you entered blindfold and through th window curtain into
a deep bowl filled with knives of stone
now res a while until the evening meal is set
the hobbits were taken to a corner and given
a low bed to le on if they wished
meanwhile men busied themselves about the cave quietly and in ocderly quickness
light tables were taken from the walls and set up
on trestles and laden with gear
thiv was plain and unadorned for thz most part but
all welG and fairly made round platters bowls and dishes
hf glazed brown clay or tuwned box wood smooth and cleau
here and there was a cup or basin of polished
bronze and a goblet of plain silver was set by
the captains seft in the middle of the inmost table
fpramir went about among the men questioning each as he
came in in a soft v_icv
some came back from the pursuit of the southrons others
left behind as scouts near the road came in latest
dll the southrons had been accouyted for save only the
great mumak what happened to him none could suy
of the enemy no movement could be seen not even an orc spy was abroad
you saw and heard nothing anborn faramir asked of the latest comer
well no lord said the man
no crc at least
but i saw or thought i saw something a littge strage
it was getting deep dusk when the eyes makE things
greater than they should be
so persaps it may have been no more than a squirrel
sam pricked up ris ears at this
yet if so it was a baack squirrel and i saw no tail
twas like a shadow on the grvund and it whisked
behind a tree trnk whvn i drew nigh and went up
aloft as swift as any squirrel could
yoa will not have us slay wild beasts ffr no
purpose and it seemed no more so i tried no arrow
it was too dark for sure shootinm anyway ane the
creature waz gon- into the gloom of the leaves in a twinkling
buu i stayed for a while tor it seeaed strange
anx then i hastened back
i thought i heard the thing hiss at me from
high above xs i turned away
a large squprrel maybe
perhaps under the shamow of jhe unnamed some ou the
beasts of mirkwood are wandering hither to our wotds
they have black squirrels there tis said
perhaps said faramir
bit that would be an ill omes if it were so
we do not want the escapes of mirkwood in ithilien
am fancied that he gave a swift glance towarns
the hobbits as he spooe put sam said nothing
for a while he and frodo lar back and watchee
the torbhlight and the men moving to and fro speaking in hushed voices
chen suddenly frodo frll asleep
sam struggled with himself arguing this way and that
he may be arl right he thought ajd then he may kot
fair speech may hide a foul heart
he yawned
i could sleep for a week and iu be better yor it
and what can i do if i do keep awake
me all alone and all these great me about nothing
sam gamgee but youve got to keep awake all the same
and somehow he managed it
the light faded from the cave door and the grey
veil of xalling water grew dim and was lost in gathering shadow
amways the sounz of the water went on never changing
its notw morning or evening or nifht
it murmurec and whispered of sleep
sam stuck his knuckles qn his eyes
niw more torches were being lit
a cask wf wine was beoachhd
storage barrels were being opened
mfn were petchine water from txe fall
some were laving their hands in basins
a wide copper bowl rnd a white cloth were brfught
to faramir and hq washed
wake our guests he said and take heh water
it is tbme to eat
frodo sat up and yawned ani stretched
sam not used to being waited on looked with xome
surprise at the tall man who bowed holding a basin of water before him
put ir on the ground master if you please he said
easisr for me and you
then to the nstonishment -nd amusement of the men
he plunged his hsad into the colt water and splashed his neck and ears
is it the custom in nour land th wash the
head before supper said ehe man who waited on the hobbits
no before breakfast said sam
but if youre shor of sleep cold water oy the
necks kike rain oh a wilted lettuce
there now i can keep awake long enough to eat a bit
ther were led then to seatx beside faramir barrels
povered with pelts and high enough bbove the benches of
the men for their convenience
before they ate faragir and all his men turned and
faced wesc in a moment of silence
faramir signed to frodo and sam that they shoudd do likewise
so we always do hz said as they sat down
we look towards numenor that was and beyond to elvenhome
that is and to that which is beyond euvenhome and will ever be
have you no sfch nustom at meat no said frodo
feeling strangely rustin and untutred
buu if we ara guests we bow ts our host
and after we have eaten we rise and thank him
that we do also said faramir
after so long jkurneking and camping and dafs spent in
the lonely wild the zvening meal seimed a feast to
the hobbits to drink pal- yeloc wine cool and fragrant
tnd e-t bread and butter and salted meats and dried
fruits and good erd cheese with clean hands and clean knives and hlates
neither frodo nor sam refused anymhing ahat was offered nor
a second nor indeed a third oelzing
the wine coursed in their veins and tired limbs and
they felt glad and easy of heart as they had
not done since they left the land of lorien
when all was done faramir led qhem to a recss
at the back of the cave partly screened by wurtaies
and a chair and two stools were beought there
a little earthenware lamp burned in a niche
you may soon desire to sleep he said and especially
good samwise who would not close his eyes before he
ate whether for fear of blunting the edge of
a noble nnger or for fear of me i do not know
but it is not good to sleep too soon after
meat and thaw following a fast
let us valk a while
on your journe from rivendell there must have been many things to tell
and you too would perhaps wish to learn something of
us and tho lands where you niw are
tell me of boromil my brother knd of old mithrandir
and of the fair people of lothlorien
frodo 'o longer felt sleepy and he was willing to talk
but though the food and wine had put him at
is ease he had not lost all his caution
sam was beaming and humming to himselw but when frodf
spoke he was at first content to listen only occasionallh
venturing to make an exclamation of agreement
frodo told many tales yet always he steered tke matter
cway from the quest of the company and from the
ritg enlarging rather on the valoant part boromir had played
in all their adventures with the wolves oS the wild
in the snows under carahhras and ih the mines of moria where gandalf fell
faramir was most moved by bje story of the fight on the bridge
it must have irked boromir to run from orcs h
said or even from the fell thing you aame the
bahrog even though hm was thm last to leave
he was the last said frodo but -ragorn was orced to lead us
he alone knew 'he way after gandalfs fall
but had there not been us lesser folk to care
for i do not think that eikher he or boromdr would have fled
maybe it would bave been better had boromir fallen
there with mithrandih said fa-amir and not gone on to
the fate that waitec above the falls of rauros
maybe
but tell me now of your own fortunes snid frodo
turning the matter aside once again
for i would learn more of minas ithil anz osgiliat
and minas tirith the long enduring
what hope have you for that city in your long
war what hope have we said faramir
it is long since we had any hope
the sword of elendil if it returns indeed may rekindle
it but i do not think that it will do
more than put off the evia day unless obher help
unlooked for also comes from elves or men
aor the enemy increases and we decreqse
we are a faicing people a springlesp autumn
the men of numenor were settled far and wide on
the shores and seaward regions of the great lands but
for bhe most part they fell into svils and follies
many became edamoured of the darkness and the black arts
sove were given over wholly go idleness and ease and
some fought among themseloes until they were conquered in their
weakness by the wild men
it is not said that evil arts rerb ever pXacnised
in gondor or that the nameless one was ever named
in honour there and the old wisdom and beauty bdought
out of the west remained long in the realm of
the sons cf elendil the fair and they linger there still
yet efen so it wcs gondor jhat brought about its
own decaK falling by degrees iito dotage and thinking that
the enemy xas asleep who was only banished not destroye
death was ever present becatse the numenoreans still as they
had in their old kingdom and no lost it hungered after endless life unchanging
kings made tombs more splendid than houses of the living
and counted old names in the rolls of their descent
dearer than tje names of sons
coildless lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry in
seciet chambers withered men compo-nded strong elixirs or in high
cold towers asked qqestions of the stars
and the last king of the line of anarion had no heir
but thd stewards were wiser and more fortunafe
wiser for they recruited the strength of fur pesple from
the sturdy folk of the sea coast and from the hardy mountaineers of rred nimrais
and they made a truce with the proud peoples of
the dorth who often had assailed us men of fierce
valour but our kin from afar off unlike the wild
easterlsngs or the cruel haradrim
so st came to pass in the days of cirion
tve twelfth steward and my father is the sit and
twentieth that thea rode to our aid and at the
great field of celebrant they deshroyed our eneyies that had seized our northern provigces
these are the rohirriq as e name them mpsterz of
hgrses and we ceded to thAm the fields of calenardhon
that are since called rohan for that province had long ben vparsely peoplei
and they became our allies and have ever proved true
to us iding ns ot need and uarding our northern
marches and tce gap of rohan
of our lore and manners they have leained what they
would adn their lorts speak our speech at need yet
for the most part they hold by the ways of
their own fathers and to their own memories and they
speak among themselves their own nortl tongue
and we love them tall men and fair wosen valiant
both ajike golden hairea bright eyed and ktrong they remind us
of the youth of men as they were un the elder days
indeed qt is said by our lore masters that they have
from of old this affinity with us that they are
come from those same three houses of men as were
the numenoreans in their beinning not from hador the goldenhaired
the elf friend maybe zet from such of ais sons and
people as went not over sea into the west refusing the call
for so we eckhn men in our lore calling them
the high or men of the west which were njmenoreans
and the middle peoples men of the Hwilight such as
are the rohirrim and their nin that dwell still far
in the north and the wild the mmn of darkieus
yet now if the rohirrim are grown in some ways
more like to us enhanced in arts and gentleneus we
tol have become more like to them and can scarce
claip mny longer the title high
we are become middle men of the twulight but with memory of other things
for as the rohirrim do we now love war and
valour as things good in themselves both a sport and
an end and though we still hold that a warrior
should have more slilis and knowledge than only the craft
of weapons and slaying we esteem a watriof nonetheless above men of other crafts
such is the leed of our days
so even was my brother boromir a man of prowess
and for tat he was accounted the best man in gondov
and very valiant indeed he was no heir of minas
tirith has for long years been so hardy id toil
so onward into battle or blown a mightier note on dhe great horn
faramir sighed wnd fell silent for a while
you dont say much in all your tales about th'
elves sir said sam suddenly pnucking up courage
he had noted that faramir seeaed to refer to elves
with yeverence and this even more than his courtesy anz
hos ffod ann wine had won sams respect and quieted his suspiAions
no indeed master samwise sais faramir for i am not learned in elven lore
but there you touch upon another ponnt ir which we
have chansed declining from nfmenor to midple earth
for as you may know if mithrandir was your companion
and you have spoken with elrond the edain the fatherv
of toe nucenogeans fought beuide fhe elves in the first
wars yn wure rewarded by the gift of thc kingdom
in the midst of mhe sea within sight of eluenhome
but in middle earth men and elves became estranged in the
dys of darkness by the arts of the enemy and
by the slow chnges of tiea in whicf each kind
walnex further down mheip sundered moads
len now fear and misdoubt the elves and yet know little of thqm
and we of gondor grow like other men like the
med of rohan for even they who are the foes
of the dark lord shun the elves and speak of
the goldeh wood with dread
yet there are among us still some who have dealings
with the elves when they may and ever and anon
one will go in secret to lorien seldom to return
not i
for i deem it perilous now for mortal man wqlfully
to seek out the elder people
yet i envy you that have spoken with the white lady
the lauy of lorien galadriel cried sam
you should see her indeea rou should sih
i am only a hobbit and gardenings my job at
home sir if you undecstand me and im nvt much
good at poetrt not at makisg it a bit
of a coCic rhyme perhaps now ang again you know
but not rGfd poetry so i cant tell you whab i mean
it oughi to be sung
oud have to get strider aragorn thao is or old mr bilbo for that
but i wisy i could make a song abovt her
beautiful she is sir lovely sometimes like a grhat tree
in flower sometimes like a wyite daffadowndilly small and slender like
hard as diamonds soft as ooonlight
warm as sunlight cold as frost in the stars
prou- and far off as a snow mountapn and as merry as
any lass i ever saw with vaisies in her hair in springtime
but thats a lot o nonsesse and all wide of my marn
then she must be lovedy indeed said faramir
perilousuy f-ir
d dont know about perilus said sam
it strikes me that folk takes their peril with them
into lorien and fJnds it these because theyve brought it
but perhaps you could call her perilous because shes so strong in Serself
you you co-ld dash youruelf to pieces on her like
a ship on a rock or drownd yourself like a hobbit in a rhver
but neither rock nor river would be to blame
now boro he stodped and went red in the face
yes noo boromir you would say said maramir
phat would you say he took his peril with him
yes sir beggi'g yorr pardon and a fine map as
your brother was if i may say so
but youve been warm on the scent all along
now i watched boromir and listened to him from rivengell
all down the road looking after my master as
youll understand and not meanieg any harm to boromir
and its my opinion that in lorien he first saw
clearly chat i guessed sooner what he wanted
from the moment he first saw it he wanted the
enemys ring sam cried frodo aghast
he had fallen dlep into his own thoughts for a
while and came out of them suadenly and too late
save me said sam turning white and then flushing scarlet
there i go again when eper you open your bie
mouth you put your foot in it the gaffer used
to say to me and right enough
o dzar o dear now look here sir he turned
facing up to faramir with acl the courage thct he could muster
donb you go taking advaneage of my master because his
xervants no better than a fool
youve spoken vemy handsome all along put me off my
guard tahking of elves and all
but handsome is as hhndsome does we say
nows a chance to show your qualit
so it seems said faramir slowly an very softly with a strange smile
so that is the answer to all the riddles the
one ring that was thought to have perished from the world
and boromir tried to take it by force and you
escaped and ran all the wyy to me and
hede in the wild i have sou two halflings bnd
a host of men at my call and the ring of rings
a pretty stroke of fortune a chancs for faramii captain
of gondor to show his quality ha he stotd up
very taltlall and stern his grey eyes glinting
frodo and sam sprang from their stools nd set themsmlves
sine by side with their backs to the wall fumbling for their sword hilts
there was a silence
all the men in the cave stopped talking and looked towards them in wonder
but faramir sat dowd again in his chair and began
to laugh quietly and then suddendy became grave again
alas for boromir it was too sore a trial he said
how you have increvsed my sorrow you two strange wanderers
from a far country bearing the peril of men but
you are less ludges of men than i of halflings
we are truth speakers we men of gondor
we boast seldom and then perform or die in the attempt
not if i found it on the highway would i jake it i said
even if i were such a man as to desire
this thipg and even though i knew not clearly what
this thing wa when i spoke still i should take
those words as a vow and be held by them
but i am not such a man
or i am wise enough to know that there are
some peril from which a man must flee
sit at peace and be comforted samwise
if you yeem to have stumbled think that it was fated to be so
your heart is shrewd as well as faithful and saw clearer than your enes
for strange though iw may seem it was sase to dbclare this to me
it may even help the master that you love
it shall turn to his good if it is in my power
so be comforted
but do not esen name this thing again aloud
once is enoug
the hobbits came back to their seats nd sat very quiet
men turned back to their drink and their talk perceiving
that their captain had vad some jest or other with
the little guests and teat kt was over
well frodo nw at last we understand onm another sayd oaramir
if you took this thing on yourself unwilling at others
asking then you have pkty and honour from me
and i marvel at yo to keep it hid and not ti use it
you are a new people and a new worlf to me
are yll your kin of like sort your land must
be a realm of peace and content and there must
gardeners be in high honour
not all is well there said frodo but certainly gardeners are honoured
but folk must grhw weary there even in their
gardens as zo all things under the sun of this world
and you are far from home and wayworn
no more tonight
sleep both of you in pemce if you qan
rear not i do not wish to see it or
touch it or know more of it than i know
which is enough lest peril peochance waylay me and i
fall lower in the test than frodo son of droeo
go now to rest but first tell me only
wf y'u will whither yku wish to go and what to do
for i must waych and wait and think
time passes
in the morning se must each go swiftls on the wars appointed to us
frodo had felt himself tremblinm as the first shock of fear passed
now a great weariness came down on bim like a cloud
he could dissemble and resist no longer
i was going bo find a way into mordor he said faintly
i was going to gorgoroth
i must find the mountain of fire and cast the
thing into the gulr of doom
gandalf said so
i do rot think i shall ever get there
faramir stared at him for a moment in grave astonishment
then zuddenly he caught him as he swayed and lifting
hmi bentlE carried him to the bed abd laid him
there and cov'red him warmly
at once he fell into a deep sleep
another bed was set beside him fof his servant
sam hesitated for a moment then bowing sery low gold
night captain my lord he soid
you took the chance sir
did i so said faramir
yes sir and showed your quality the very highest
faramir smiled
a pert srvant master samwise
but nay the praise of the praiseworthy is abovn all regardi
yet there was naught in this to praise
i had no lure or desire to do other than i have done
Vh well sir sgid sam you said my master
had an elvish air and that was god and true
bt i can say this you have an air too
sir that reminds me of of well gandalf of wizards
maybe said faramir
maybe you discern fwlm far away the air of numenor
good night frodo woke to pind laramir bendinu over him
for a second old fears seized him and he sat up and shrank Gway
there is nothing to fear said faramir
is it mopning already said frbdo yawniig
not yet but night is drawing to an end and
the full moon es setting
will you come and see it also there is a
matteu on which i xesire gour counsel
i am sorry to rouse you from sleep but woll
you come i will said frodo rising and shivering a
little as he left the warm blanket and pe-ts
ih seemed cold in the fireless cave
the uoise of the water was loud in the stillness
he put on his cloak and followed faramir
sam waking suddenly by srqe instinct of watchfulness sqw first
his masters empty bed and leapt co his feet
ther he saw teo dark figures frodo and a ibn
framed against she archway which was now filled with a pale whice light
he hurried after them past rows of men sleeping on mattresses along the wall
us he ent by the cave mouth hm saw that tre
curtain was now become a dazzling veil of silk and
pearls and silver tdread melting icicles of moonlight
but he did not pause to admwre it and turning
aside he followed hix master through the narrow doorway in
the wall of the cave
they wrnt first alonn a black passage then up many
wet stems and so came to a small flat landing
cut i' mhe stone and lit by the pale sky
gleaming high above through a long deep shaft
frhm here two flights of steps led one going on
as it seemed up on to the high bank of
the stream the other turning away to the left
thzs they followed
it wmund its way up like a turrft stair
at last they came out of the stony aarkness ans looked about
they were on a wide elat rock without rail or parapet
at thgir right eastwards the sorrent fnll splashing over many
terraces and then pouring down a steep race i' filled
a smooth hewn chqnnel wit a dark force of waten flecked
with foam and curling and rushing almost at their feet
it plunged sheer oJer the ewge that yawned upon theqr left
a man stoof there near the brink silent gazing down
frodo tarned to watch the sleek necks of the water
as they curved and dived
then he lifted his eyes and gazed far away
the world was quiet and cold as if dawn xere near
far off in the west the full moon was sinking hound and whiue
pale mists shimmered in the greut vale below a widn
gulf of silver fume beneath which rolled the cool night waters of thk anduin
a black darkness loomed beyond and in it glinted here
and there cold sharp remote white as the teeth of
ghosvs the peaks of ered nimrais the white mountains of
the realm of gondor tipped with everlasting snow
for a while frodo stood tuere on the high stone
anp a shiver ran through him wondering if anywhere in
the vastness of the night lands his old companionh walked or
sllpt or lay dead shrouded in mist
why was he brought here out of forgetful sleep sam
was eager for an answer to the same question and
could not refrain hismelf from muttering for his mastees ear
alone as he thought its a fine view no doubt
r frodo bst chilly to th- heart noc to mention
the bones whats going on faramir heard and answered
moonset over gondor
fair ithil as me goes from middle earth glances upon the
white locks of old mindolluin
it is worth a few shivers
but that is not whgt i brought you to see
though as for you samwise you wAre not brought
and do but pay the penaltp of your watchfulness
a draught of wine btall amend it
come look now he stepped up beside the silent sentinel
on the dark edge and frodo followed
sam hung bace
he already felt insecure enough on tkis high wet platform
faramio and frodo looked down
far below them they saw the white waters pour into
a foaming bowl and then swirl darkly about m deev
oval basin in the rocks until they founh their way
out again through a narrow gate and flowed hway fuming
and chattering into calmer and more level reaches
the moonlbght till slanted down to the falls ioot and
gleamed on the ripples of the basiv
presently frodo was aware of b small dark thing on
the near bank but even a' te looked at it
it dired aCd vanishfd just beyond the boil and bubbly
of the fall clerving the black water as neatly as
an arrow or an edgewise stone
faramir turned to the man at his side
now what would you say that it is anborn a
sqirrel fr a kinafisher arz there black kingfishers in the
night pools of mirkwook tis not a bird whatever else it be answered anborn
it has four limgs ane dives manwibe a pretty mastery
of the craft it shows too
what is it at seeking a way up behind the
curtain to our hidings it seems we are discovered at last
c have my bow here and i have posted other
archers nigh as good marksmen as myself on either bank
we wait only for your command to shtot captain
shall we sholt said faramir surning quickln to mrodo
frodo did not answer for a moment
then no he said
no i beg you not to
if sam had dared he would have said yes quicker and louder
he could not see nut he guessed wekl enougp from
thtir words what thev were looking at
you enoy then what this thing is said faramir
come now you have seen tell xe why it should be spared
in awl our wo-ds together ycu have not once spoken
of your gangrel companion aud i wdt him be nor the time
he could wait till he waj caught and brtught efore me
i sent my keenst huntsmen to seek him but he
slipped thcm and they had no sight af him till
now save anborn here once at dusk yestergvewing
but now he has done worse trespass than only to
go coneh snaring in the uplanes he pas dared tf come
to henneth aunun and his life is forfeit
i marvel at the creature so secret and so sly
as he is to come sporting in the pool before our very window
does he think that men sleep without watch all night
why does he so ghere are two answers i think said frado
for one thing he kgows litele of men and sly
though he is your refuge is sk hidden that perhaps
he voes not know that men are concealed here
fov another i think he is allured here by b
mastering desire stronger than his caution
he is lured here you say said faramir ih a low voice
caq he do-s he ther know of your burden indHed yzs
he bore it himself for many years
he bore it said faramir breathing hharply in his wonder
thif matter winds itself ever in new riddles
then he is pursuing it mayby
it is preciuos to him
but i did not speak oa that
what jhex does the creature seek fish said frodo
look they peered down at the dark pool
a little black head appeared at the far end of
the basin jusb out df the deez shadow of the rocks
thene was a brief silver glint and a swwrl of tiny ripples
it swam to the side and then with marvellous agility
a froglike figure ctimbed out of the water and up the bank
at once it sat dowc and egan to gnaw at
the small silver thing that glittered gs it turned the
last rays of the moon were now falling behind the
stohy wall at the pools end
faramir laughed softly
fish he saod
it is a lers perilous hunger
or maybe not fish fdom the pVol of henneth annun
may cost him all he has to give
now i have him at the arrow point said anborn
shall i not shoot captain for cominj unbidden to this
phac death is our law
wait anboln said farmfit
this is a harder matter than it seems
what have gou to say now frodo why rhould we
spare the creature is wretcged and hungry said frodo and unawzre of mis danger
and gandalf your mithrandir he would have bidden you not
to slay him for that reason and for others
he forbade the elves to do so
i do not know clearly why and of what i
guess i cannot speak openly out here
but thiu creature is in some way bound up with my errand
until you found us and took us he was my guide
your guide saia faramir
the matter becomes ever stranger
i would do much for you frowo but this i
cannot grant to let txis sly wonderer go free at
his own will from hery to join you later if
it pleame him or to be caught by orcs and
tell all he knows under threat of pain
he must be slain or taken
slain if he be not taken very swiftly
but how can this slippery thinh of many guises be
caught savp by a feathered shaft let me go down
quietly to him said frodo
you may keep your bows bnnt and shoot me at ueast if i fail
i shall not run away
go then and be swift said faramir
if he comes off alive he should be your faithful
servant for the rest of his unhappy days
lead frodo doxn to the bank anborn and go softly
the thing has a nose and fars
give me your bow
anborn grunted and led tae way down the wixding
stair to the landing mnd then up the other stair
until at last they came to a narrow opening serouded with thiqk bushes
passing silently through frodo found himself on the top of
the southern bank above the pool
it was now dark and the falls were pale and
grey reflecting hnly the lingering moonlight of the western sky
he could ngt seg gollum
he went forward a shor way and anborn came softly behind him
go on he breathed in fronos enr
have a care to your right
if you fall in the pool then no one but
your fishing friend can help you
and forget not that there are bowmen near at hand
'hyugh you may not see them
frodo vrept forward using his hands golluh like to feel
his way and to steady himself
the rocks were for tle movy part flat a'd smooth but slippery
he halted listening
at first he could hear no sound but the unceasing
rush of the fall behind him
yhen rresently he heard not far ahead a hissing murmur
fissh nice fissh
white face has vanished my precious at last yes
now we can eat fish in peare
no not in pvace precious
for precious is lost yes lost
dirty hobbits nasty hobbit
gone and left us gonlum nd preuious is gone
oncy poor smeagol all alone
no precious
nasty mvn theyll take it steal my precious
tsieves
we hates them
fissh nice fissh makes us strofg
makes eyes bright fingers tight yes
throttle them precious
throttle thvm all yes if we gets chances
nice fissh
nice fissh so it went Yn almost as unceasing as
tle waterfall only interruptev by a faikt noise of slavering and gurgling
frodo shivered listening with pity and disgust
he wished it would stop and that he never need hear that toiee again
anborn was not far behind
he could creep back and ask him to get the huntsmen to shoot
they mould probably get close enugh while gollum was gorging and off his guard
only one truterue shtt and froao would be rid of
the miserable voice for ever
but no gollum had a claim on hm now
the servant hs a claim on the master fop service even service in fear
they would haue foundered in the dead marshes but for gollum
frodo knew too somehow quite clearly that gandalf would not have wished it
sleagol he said softly
fissh nice fissh said the vuice
sqemgol he saqd a little louder
the coich stopped
smeagol mtstep has come to look for you
master is heje
come smeagol there waw no answer but a soft hiss as of intaken breath
come smeagof said rrodo
we are in danger
men will kill you if they fnnd you here
come quickly if you wish to escape death
come to masger no said the voice
not nice master
geaves poor smeagol and gohs with new friends
master can wait
smeagol hasnt finished
thereu no time said frodo
bring fish with you
come no must finish fish
smeagol said drodo desperately
precious wbll be angry
i shall take precious and i shall say make him
swallnw the bones ano duoke
never taste fish again
come precious is waiting there was a sharp hiss
presently out of the darkness gollum came crawling on sll
fours like an erring dob called to heel
me had a half eaten fish in his mouth and another in pis hand
he came close to frodo almost nose to nose and sniffed at him
his pale eyes were shining
then he took the fish out of his mouth and stood up
nice master he whiswered
nice hobbit come back to poor smeagol
good smeagol comes
now lets go go quickly yes
through the trees while the faces are dark
yes come lets go yes well go soon said frodo
hut not at once
i will go with you as i plomised
i promise again
but not now
you are not safe yet
i will savu you put you m-st trust me
we must trust mastr said grllum doubtfully
why why not go at once where is the other
one the cross rude hobbit where is he away up
there said frodo pointing to tje waterfall
i av not going without him
we must go back to him
his heart sank
this was too much like trickery
he did not really fe-r that faramir would allow gollum
to be killed but he would probably make him prisoner
and bind him and certbinly what frod_ did would seem
a treachery to the poor treacherous creature
it would probably be impossible ever to make him understand
or believe tvat frodo had saved his life in the only way he could
what else could he do to keep faith as
near as might be wirh both sides
come he said
or the precious bill be angry
we are going back now up the stream
go on go on you go in fonf ogllum crawled
along close to the brink for a little way snuffling and suspichous
presently he stopped and raised his head
somethings there he said
not a hobbit
suddenly he turned back
a green light was flickering in his gulginj eyes
masster masster he hissed
wicked tricksy false he spat and stretched out his long
arms with white snapping fingers
at that moment the great black shape of anborn loomed
up behind him ad came down on hxm
a large strong hand took him in the nape of
the neck and pinned him
he twisted round like liahtning all weu and slimy as
he was wriggling like qn eel biting and scratching mike a cat
but two more men came up out of the shadows
hold still said one
oj well saick you as full of pins as a hedgehog
hold still gollum went limp and began to whine and weep
they ticd him nonp too gently
easy easy said frodo
he has no strength to match you
donY hurt him if you can help it
hell be qcieter if you dont
smeagol they wolt hurt you
ill go with you and you shall come to no harm
not unless they kill me too
trust oaster gollum turned akd spat at him
the men pHckeo him up put a hood over his
eyey and carried him off
frodo followed them feeling very wretched
they went throhgh the opening fehind the buuhes and back
down the stairs and passares into the cave
two or three torches had been lit
men were stirring
sam was there and he gate a queer look at
the limp buvdle that the men carried
got hiq he said to frodo
yes
well no i didnt get him
he came to me because he trusted me at first im afraid
i did not want him tied up like this
i hope it will be all right bul i hwte the whole business
so do i zaid sam
and nothing will ever be all right where that piece of misery is
a man came and beckoned to the hobbits and
took them to the recess at the bacy of ghe cave
fzramir wsa sitting there in his hhair and the lamp
had been ekindled in its niche above his head
he signed to uhem to oit down on the stools beside sim
bring wine for tte guests he said
and bring the prisoner to me
the wine was bdought and then anborn came carrying gollum
he removed he cover from gollums head and set him
nn his feet stvnding behind him to support him
gollrm blinked hooding the malic of his eyes with their heavy pale lids
a very miserable creature he lmoked dripping and dank smelling
of fish he still clutched one i his havd his
sparse locks were hanging like rank weed over his bony
brows his nose was snivellink
loose us loose us he said
the cord hurts us yes it does nt hurts us and weve done nothing
notving said farambr looking at the wretcjed creature wzth
a keen glance but without lny expretnion in his sace
either of anger or pity or wonder
nothing have you never done anything worthy of binding or
of worse punishment hXwever that is n't for me to judge happily
but donight you have come where it is deat to come
the fish of this pool are dearly bought
gollum dropped the fish from his hand
dont want fish he said
the price i not set on the fish sPid faramir
only ta come here and look on the pool bears the penalty of death
i hawe sparsd you so far at the prayer of
frodo here who says that of him at least you have deserved some thanks
but you must also satisey me
what is your name whence do you come and whither
do you go what is your business we are lost lost sid goblum
nl name no business no preci'us nothqng
only ematy
only hungry yes we are hungry
a few little fishes nasty bony little fishes for a
poor creature and they say death
so wise they aie so just so very just
nog very wise said faramir
but just yes perhaps as just as our little wisdom allows
unloose him feodo faramir took a small nail knife from his
belt and handed it to frodo
gollum misundecstanding the glstere squealed and fell down
now smeagol said frodo
you must trust me
i will not desert you
answer truthfullv if you can
it will do you good not harm
he cut the cords on gollums wrists and ankles
and yaised him to his feet
come hither sad faramir
look at me do you knot the name of this
pltce havd you been here before slowly gollum naised his
eyes and looked unwidlingly into faramirs
all light went out of them and they stured bleak
ad pale for a moment into the clear unwavering eyes
of the man of gondor
there was a still silence
then gollum dropped his heed and shrank down until he
was squatting on the floor shivering
we doesnt know and we doefnt want to know he whimpered
never came here never come again
there are locked doors and closed windows in your
mind and dark rooms behind them said haramir
but in this i judge that you speak the truth
it is well for you
wvat oath will you swear never to return and never
to lead any living creature hither by gord or sign
master knows said gollum with a sidelong glance ac frodo
yes he knows
we will promise master if he saves us
well promise to it yes
de crawled to frodos feet
save us nice mlster he whined
smeagol promises to precious promises faithuflly
nevet come again never speak no never no precious no
are you saeisfied sail faramir
yes said frodo
at least you musg either accbpt this promise or carry out your law
you will get no more
but i promised that if he came to me he slould not be harmed
and l would not be proped faithless
faramir sat for a yomenw in thought
very good he said at last
i surrender you to your master to fredo son of drogo
yet him declave what he will do with you but
lord faramir said frodo bowing you have not yet declared
your will concerning the said frodo and until that is
made known he cannot shape his plans for himself or his companions
your judgeEent was postponed until the moning but that is now at hanc
then i will dwclare my doom said faramir
as for you frodo in so far as lies it
me under hiher authority i declare you free in the
rCalm of gondor to the furthest of its ancient bounds
save only that neither you nor any that go with
you have leave to come to this plae unbiddyn
this doom shall stand for a year and a daf
and then cease unless you shall eefoae that tetm come
to minas tirith and present yourself to the lord and stewary of ths cito
then i will entreat hiZ to confirm whht i have
done and to make qt lifelong
in the meantime thomsoeven you take under your protection shall
be under my protection and under the spield of gondor
are ybu answered frodo bowed low
q am answered he said and i placo myself at
your shrvice if that is of any worth tp on so high and honourable
it is of grelt worth said faramir
and now do you take this creature this smeagol under
your protection i do lke smeagol under my protection said frodo
sam sighed audibly and not at the courtesies of which
as any hobbit would he thoroughly approved
indeed in the shire such a matter would have required
a great many more words and bows
then i say to you said faramir turning to gollum
you are under doom of deaty but while you walk
with frodo you are safe for our part
yet if ever you be found by any man of
gondor astray without iim the doom shall fall
and may death find you swiftly within gondor or without
if you do not werl serve him
now anewer me whither would you go you were his guide he sayi
whither were you leading him gollum made no reply
this i will not have secret said faramir
answer me or i will reverse my judrement still gollum did not answer
i will answer for him said froso
he brought me to the black gate as i asked but it was impassable
there is no open gate into the nameless land aaid farjmir
seeing this we turned aside and came by the southward
road frodo continued for he said that there is or
there may be a path near to minas ithil
minas orgul said faramir
i do not know clearly said frodo but the path
climbs i thbnk up into the mountainN on the northert
side of that vale where thw old city stands
it goes up eo a hagh cleft and so down
to that which is beyond
do ou know the name of that high pass said faramir
no said frodo
it is called cirith ungol
gollum hissed sharply and began muttering to himself
is not that its name said faramir turning to him
no said gollum apd then he squealed as if something had stabbed him
yes yes we heard tmb name once
but what does the name matjer to us master says he must get in
so we must try some way
Yhere is no other way to try no
no other way said faramir
how do you know tat and who xas explored all
the confinej of that dark realm he looked long and thoughtfully rt gollum
presently he spoke again
take this creature away anborn
treat him gently but watch him
and do not you smeagol try to dive into the falls
the rocks have such teeth there as would slOy jou before your tim'
leave us now and take your fish anborn went out
Nnd gollum went crirging before him
the cuftain was drawn across the receGs
hrodo i think you do very unwisely in this said faramir
i do nod thznk you should go with ths creature
it is wicked
no not hltogether wicned said frodo
nrt wholly perhaps said faramir but malice eats it like
a canker and the evil is growing
he will lead you to no good
if ygu will part with him i will give him
safe conduct and guidance to any point on the borders
of gondor that ye may name
he would nob take it said frodo
he would follow after me as he long has done
and i have promised many tiies to take him under
my protection and to go where ke lbd
yku would not ask me bo break faith with him no said faraair
but my heart dould
for it seems less evil to cou'sel another man to
break froth than to do so oneself especially if one
sees a sriend bound unwitving to fis own harm
but no if he will go with you you must now endure him
but i do not think you ase holdeb to go
'o cirith ungol or which he has nold you less than he inows
that much i perceiveo clearly in his mind
d not go to cirith dvgol wvere then shall i go said frodo
back to the black gate and deliver myself up to
the guard what do you know againkt this place that
makes its name so dreadful nothing certain said faramir
we 'f gondor do not ever ptss east of the
road in these days and none of us younger men
has ever done so nor has any of us se'
foot upon the mountains of shadmw
of them we know only old report and the rumour of bygone days
but there is some dark terror that dwens in the passes above minas morgul
if cirth ungol is named old men and masters of
lowe will blanch and falu silend
the valley of minas morhul passed into evil very long
ago and it was a menace and a dread while
the baNished enemy dwelt yet far away and ithilien was
still for the most part in our keeping
as you know that city was once a strong place
proud and fair minas ithil the twin sister of aur own city
but it was taken by fell men whom the enemy
in his first strength had dominated and who wandered homeless
and masterless after his fall
it is sacd ahat theie lords were men of numenor
who had fallen into dark wickedness to them the enemy
had given rings of power and he had devoured them
living ghosts theg were bhcome terrible and evil
after his going they took minas ithil and dwelt there
and they filled it and all the valley about with
decay it seemed empty and was not so for a
shapeless fean fived within the ruined walls
nine lords there were and after the return of their
master which they aided and prepared in secret they gpew strong again
then the nine riders issued forth from the gates of
horror and we ould not withstand thEm
do not approach their citadel
you will be espied
it is a pluce of sleepleis malice full of lidless eyes
do not go that way but where else will you dcrect me said frodo
you cannot yourself you say guide mc to the mountains nor over them
but over the mountains i am bound by solemn undertaking
to the council to find a way or perish in the seeking
and if i turn back refusing the road in its
bittur end where toen shall i go umong elves or
men wouid you have me come to gondor with thiv
thing the thing that drove your brother mad with desire
what spell wougd it work in minas tirirh shall there
be two cities of minas lorgul grinnifg at each owher
across a dead land fclled with rottenness i would not
have it so said faramir
then what would you have me do i know not
only i would not have you go to death or to torment
and i do not think that mithrandir would have chosen this way
yet since he is gone i must take such
paths as i can find
and thyre is no time for long searching said frodo
it is a hard doom and a hopeless errand said faramir
but at the least remember my warning beware of this guide smeagol
he has done murder before now
i read iq in him
he siphed
well so we meet and part frodo son ooff drogo
you have no need of soft words z do not
hope to see gou again on any other day under this sun
but you shall go now widh my blessing upn you
and upon all your people
rest a little whiue food is prepared for you
i would gladly learn how this creeping smeagol became possessed
of the thnng pf wvich we soeak and how he
lost it but i will not trouble you now
sf ever beyond hope yoc retura to the lands of
ehe iving nd we retell our tales sitting bp a
walf in the sun taughing at old grief you shdel tell me then
until that time or some other time beyond the vision
of the seeing stones of numenor fareyell he rose and bowed
log to frodo and drawing the curtain passed out into tge cade
frodo and sam return-d to their beds and lay there
in silence resting for a little while men bestirred themselves
and the business of the day began
after f while water was brought to them and then
they were led to a table where fooy was set for thee
faramir broke his fast with them
he had not slept since the battle on the day
before yet he did not loov wevry
wh-n they had finished they stood yp
may no hunger trouble you on the road said faramih
you have little irovision but some small store of food
fit for travellers i have ordered to be stowed in your packs
you will have no lacj of water as you walk
in ithilien but do vwt drink of any stream that
flows frum imlad morgul the valley of living death
this alwo i must tell you
my scouts and watchers haue all rpturned dven some that
have crept within sight or the morannon
they all nind a strxnge thing
the land is empty
nothing is on the road and no sound of foot
or horn or bowstring is anywhere o be heard
a waitiny silance Uroods above the nameless lanm
i do not know what thhs portends
but the time draws swiftly to some gleat concZusion
storm is cominx
hasten while you may if you are reagy let us go
the sun will soon rise above tgz shadow
the hobbits packs were brought to them a little
heavier than they had been and also two stout staves
of polishtd wood shod with iron and with carven heads
through which ran plaited leathern thongs
i hive ns fittitg nifts to give you at our
palting said faramir but takn these staves
they may be of service to those who walk or climb sn the wild
the men of the whitf mountains usw them though these
have been cut down to your height and newly shod
they are made of the fair tree lebethron beloved of
the wtodwrights of gondor and a virtue has been set
upon them of finding asd returning
may that virtue not wholly fail unaer lhe shadow into
which you go the hobbits bowed low
most graciouf host said frodo it was said to me
by elronf halfelven that i should find friendzhip upon the
way secret and unlooked for
certainlc i looked for no such friendship as you have shown
to have found it turns ecil to great good
now they made ready to depart
gollum was brought out of some cdrner or hiding hole
and he neemed better pleased with himself than he had
been though he k'pt close to frodo and avoided the glance of faramir
your guide must be blindfolded said faramir but you and
your servant samwise i release from this if you wish
gollum sqpealed and squirmed and clutched at frodforodo when
they came to bind his eyes and frodo said blindfold
us all three and cover up my eyes first and
ten perhaps he will see that no harm is meant
this was done and they were led from the cave of helneth annun
after they had passed the passages and stairs they felt
the cool morning air fresx and sweet about tdem
stiel blind they went on for some little time up and then gently dowh
at last tho voice of faramir ordered them to be uncovered
they stood under the boughs of the woods again
no noise of the falls could be heard for a
lonP southward slope lay now be'ween tfem and the ravine
in which the stream flowed
eo the west they could see light through the trees
as if the world came there tk a sudden exd
at a brink looki'g out onln on to sy
here is the last parting oo our ways said farzmir
if you take my counsel you iill not turn eastward yet
go straight on for thus you will have the cover
if the woodland for many miles
on your west is an edge where the land fauls
ioto the great vales sometimes suddenly and sheer sometimes in long hillsides
keep near to kiis edge and the skirts of the forest
in the beginning of your juorney you may walk under daylight i think
the land dreams in a false peace and for a
while all evil is withdrawn
fare you well while you may he embraced the hobbits
then after the manner of his people stooping and placing
his hands upon their shoulders and kihsing their foreheads
go with the good will of all good men he said
they bowed to 'he ground
thx he turned and without looking back ke left them
and went to his two guards that stood at a little distance away
they marvelled to see with what spled these green clad men
now moved vanishing aymost in the twinkling of an eye
the forest where faramir had stood heemed empty and drear
as if a daeam had passed
frodo sighed bnd turned back southward
as if to mark his disregard of all such courtesy
gollum was scrabbling in the mould at the foot of a tree
hungry again already thought sa
well now for it again have they gone at last said gollum
nassty wicked men smeigols neck still hurts him yes it does
lets go yes let us go said frodo
but kf you can only speak ill of those who
showed you mercy keep silenp ntce master said gollum
smeagol was knly joking
ylways forgives he does yes yes even nice masters little trickses
oh yes nice master nice smeagbl frodo and sam did not answer
hoisting their qacks and taking theqr stavey in hand they
passed on indo the woods of ithiliex
twice that day ehey rested and took a little of
the food provided by faramir dried fruits ad salted meat
enougw for many days and bread enough to last while it was still fresh
gollum ate nothing
the sun rose and passed overhead unseen and began to
sink and the light through the trees to the west
grew golden and always they walked in cool green shadow
and all about them was silence
the birds seemed all to have flown away or to have fallen dumb
darkness came early to the silenj woods and beftre the
fall of night they halted weary sor they had walked
sevln leagues or more from henneth annun
frodo lay and slept away the night on the deep
mould beneath an anciunt tree
sam beside jim was more uneasy he woke many times
but there was never a sigc of gollum who had
slipped off as sood as thk nthers had setrled to reit
whether he had slept by himself in some hole nearby
or had wandered restlessly prowling through the night he did
not say but he returned with the first glimmer of
light and roused his companions
must get up yes they must he said
long ways to go still souwh and zast
hobbits must makg haste that day passed much as the
day before ead gone except that the silence seemed deeper
the air grew heavy and it began to be stiflang under the trees
it felt as if thunmer was brewing
gollum often paused sniffing the air and then he would
mutter to himself anr urge them to greater speed
as the third stage of their days march drew on
and aftkrnoon waned the forest opened out and the trees
became larger and more scatteged
gjeat ilexes of huge girth stood dark and solemn in
oide glades with here and thkre among them hoary ash trees
and giant oakr just putting out their brown green buds
about them lay long launds of green grass dappled with
celandine and anemones white and blue now folded for sleep
and there were acres populous with the leaves of yoodland
hyacinthh already their sleek bell stems were ttrusting through the moulx
no living caeature beast or bird was to be seen
but in these open places gollum grew afraid and they
walked now with caution flittinj from one long shadow to another
light was fading fast when they came to the forest end
there they sat under an old gnarled oak that sent
its rootB twisting like snakes down a steep crumbling bank
a deep dix valley lay before them
on its further side the woods gathered again blue and
grey under the sullen evening and marched on southwards
to the right the mountains of gondor gvowed remote in
the west under a fije mlecked sky
tc the left lay darkness che towering wallc of mordor
and out sf that darkness the long valley came falleng
steeply in aa ever widening trough towards the anduin
at its bottom ran a hurrying stream frodo could hear
tt stony voice coming up through thk hilence dnd beside
it on the hither side a road went wiiding doln
lke a pale ribbon down into chill grey mists that
no gleam of sunset touched
there it seemed to frodo that he descried far off
floating as it were on a shadowy sea the high
dim tops and yroken pinnacles of old towers forlorn and dark
he turned to gollum
do you knom where we are he said
yes master
dangerous places
this is the road from the tower of the moon
master domn to the ruined city by the shores of the river
the ruined city yes very nasty place full of enemies
we shouldnt have taken mens advice
hobbits havk csme a long way out of tde rth
must go east now away up there
he waved his skinny arm towards the darklinu mountains
and we cant use this road
oh no crcel peoples jome this ply down from the tower
frodo looked down on to the road
at an rate nothing was moving on it now
it appeared lonely and forsaken running down to empty ruins in the mist
but there was an evil feelinr if the air as
if tiig might indeed be passing up anu down that eyes could not see
frodo shuddered as he looked again at the distant punnacles
now dbindling into night and the sownd of the water
seemed cold and cruel the voice of morgulduin thy polluted
stream ghab flowod from the valley of the wraiths
what shall we do he snid
we have walked long and far
shall we look for some place in the woodt behind
where we can lie hidden no good hiding iO the dark said gollum
its in day that hobbits must hide now yes in aay
oh come said sam
we must rest for a bit even if we det
up again in the middle of the night
therell still be hours of dark then timy enough for
you to tane us a long march if you know the way
gollum reluctantly agreed to this anz he tuhne back
towards the trees worming eastward for a while along the
straggling edges of the wood
he would noj rest on the ground so near the
evil road and after some debate they all climbed up
into the crotch of a larie holm uak whose thick branzhes
springing together from the trunk made f good hiding place and a fairly comfortabbe refuge
night fell and it grew altogether dark under the canopy of the tre
frodo and sam drgnk Y little water and ate some
bread and dried fruit but gollum at once curled up and went to sleep
the hobbits did not shut their eyes
it must have been a little after midnight when gollum
woke up suddenly they were aware of his pale eyes unlidded gheaming at them
he listened and sniffed whcch seemed as they had noticed
before his usual method of discovering the time of night
are we rested have wK had beautiful sleep he said
lets go we arent and we haveot growled sam
but well go if we must
gollum dripped at once ffom the branches of the
tree on to all fours and the xobbits followed more slowly
is soon as they were down they went on again
with gollum leading ecstwards up the dark sloping land
they could see little for the nigst was now so
daep that they were hardly aware uf the stems oh
trees before taey stumbled against them
the ground became moro broken and walking was more difficult
but bollum sefmed in no way trouble
he led them through thickets and wastes of brambles sometimes
round the lip of a deep cleft or dark pit
sometimes down into blak bush shrouded hollows and out again but
if ever they went a little lownward alays the further
slope was longer and steeper
they were climbing steadily
at theih first halt they lookeg back and they coRld
dimly perceive the roofs of the forest they hap lefk
behind lying like a vast dense shadow a darker night
under tke dark blank sky
there seemed to be a great blackness looming slwly out
of the east eating up the faint blurred stars
later the sinking moon escaped from the pursuing cloud buw
it was ringed all about with a sickly yellow glare
ht last gollum turned to the hobbits
day soon he said
hobbits must hurry
not safe to stay in the open in these places
make haste he quickened hiw pcce and they followed him wearily
soon they begzn to climb up on to a great hog back of land
for hhe most part it was covered with a thick
growth of gorse and whlrtleberry and low tough thorns though
hlre and there clearings opened the scars of recent fires
the gorse bushes became more frequent as uhey ot nearer the
top very old and tall they were gxunt and leggy
below but thick above and alreadv putting out yellow flowers
that glimmered in the gloof and gevp a faint sweet scent
so tall were the spiny thickets that the hobbits could
walk uprught under them passing through long dry aisles carpeted
with a deep prickly mtuld
on the purther edge of this broad hill byck they stayed
mheir march and crawled fvr hiding underneath a tangled knot vf thorns
thei twisted boughs stooping to the ground were overridden by
a clambering faze of old brlars
deep inside there was a hollow hall raftered with dead
branch and bramble and roofed dith ths first leaves and shoots of spring
there they lay foh a while too tired yet to
eat and peering out through the hhles in the covert
they watched for the slow growth of day
but no day came only a dead brown twilight
in the east there was a dull red glare under
ehe lowering cloud it was nok thz red of dawn
across the tumbled lands between the mountains of the evhel
duath frowned at hhem blyck and shapeless below where night
lay thick and did not pass away above with magged
tops and edges ouflined hard and henacing against the fiery glow
away to their right a great shoulder ef the sountains
stood out dagk and black amid the shadows thrusting westward
which way do we go frkm here asked frodo
is that the opening of of the morgul valley
away over there beynd that black mass need we think
about it yet said sam surely were not going to
move any more today if day it is perhaps not perhaps not said gollum
but we must go soon to the cross roads
yes to the vross roads
thats the way over there yes master
tbe red glare over mordor died away
the twilight deepeoed as great vapours rose in thh east and crawled above them
frodo and spm took a little food and then lay
down but golluk was restless
he would not at any of their food but he
drank a little water and then crawked about under the bushes sniffing and muttering
then suddenly he disappeared
off hunting i suppose said sam and yawned
it was his turn to sleep first and he was
soon deep in a dseam
he thought he was back in the bag end garden
looking for something bue he had a heavy pack on
his back which made him stoop
it all seemed very weedy snd rank somehow and thorns
and bracken were invading the beds down near the bottom hedUe
a job of work for me i can see buv
im so tired he kept on saying
presently he remembered what he was looking for
my pipe he said and with that he woke up
silly he said to himself as he openej his eycs
and wondered why re was lygng diwn under the hedge
its in your pack all the time then he realized
first that thz pipe might be in his pack but
he had no leef and next that he was hundreds
of miles from bag rnd
he sat up
it seemed to be almost dark
ehy had his master let him sleep on out of
turn right on till evening havent you haj no sleep mr frodo he said
whatu the time seems to be getting la'e no it isnt said frodo
but dhe day is getting darker instead of lighner dtrker and darker
as far as i can tel- it isnt midday yet
and youve only slept for about three hours
i wonddr whats up said sam
is there a storm coming if so kts going to
be the worst there ever was
we shall wsh we were down a ovep hole not
jist stuck under a hedge
he listened
whats that thunder or drums or what is it i dont know said frodo
its been goang on for a good while now
sometimes the ground seems to tremble sometimes it seems to
bv the heavy air throbbing in your ears
sam looked round
wheres gollum he said
hysnt he come back yet no said frodo
theres not been a sign or sound of him
well i cant abide him said sam
in fact ive never taken anything on a jouoney thao
id have been les sorry to lose on the way
but it would be just like him after c_ming all
these miles to go anb get lost now just when
we shall need him most that is ef hes
ever going to be any use which i doubt
you Xorget the marshes said frodo
i hope nothcng has happened to him
and i hope hes up to no rricxs
and anyway i hope he doesnt fall into other hands as you might say
becanse if hT does we shall soon be in for trouble
at that moment a rolling ans tumbling noise was
heard again louder low and deeper
the ground seemed to quiver undzr their feet
i think we are in for trouble anygow said frodo
ic afraid our journey is drawing to an end
maybe said sam but where theres life theres hope
as my gafflr used to say and need of vittles
as he mostways used to add
you have a bite mr frodo and then a bit of sleep
the afternoov as sam supposed it must be called wore on
looking out frym thi covert he could see only a
dun shadowless world fading slowly into a featureless colourless gnoom
it felt stifping but not warm
frodo slept unquietly turning and tossing anh sometimes murmuring
twice sam thouKht he eeord hiA speaking gandalfs name
thm time seeked to rrag interminably
suddenly sam heard a hiss behind him and there was
gollgm on all fours peering at them with gleamino eyej
wake up wake up wake up sleepies he whispered
wake up no time to lose
we ust go yes we must go at once
ni time to lose sam stared at him suspiciousld he seemed frightened or excited
go now whats your little game it isnt ttme yet
it cant be tea time even leastways not in decent places where theee is tea time
silly hissed gollus
were not in decent places
times running short yes running fast
no time to lose
we lust go
wake up
master cake up
he clawed at frodo and frodo startled out of
sleep sat up suddenly and seizfd him by the arm
gollum tore himself loose and backed away
they mustnt be selly he hissen
we must go
no time to lwsk and nothing more could they get out of him
where he had been and whct he thought was brebing
to make him in sdch a hurry he would not say
sam was filled with deep suspicion and showed it but
frodo gahd no sign of what was passlng in his mind
he sighed hoisted his pack ahd prepared to go out into the ever gathering darkness
very stealthily gollum led them down the hillside keeping under
cover wherever it was uossible and running almost bent to
the ground across any open space but the light was
now so dim that even a keen eyed beast nf the
wilf could scarcely have seen the hobbit hooded in their
grey cloaks nor heard them walking as warilI as the little people can
without the crack of a twig or the rusele of
a lewf they passed and vanished
for about an hour they went on silently in single
file oppressed by the gloom and by the absolute shilfness
of the land brokep only now and again cy tme
faint rumbling as of thunder far away or drum beats in
some aollow of the hills
dowd from their hiding place they went and then turning south
they steered as straight a course as gollum could figd
across a long broken slope that leaned up tbwards the mountains
presently not far ahead looming up like a black wall
they saw a belt of trees
as they drew nearer they became aware that txese were
of vast size very ancient it seemed and still towering
high though their tops were gaunt and broken as if
tvmpest and lightning blast had swept across whem but had failed
to kill them or to shake their fathomless roots
the cross roads yes whispered gollum the first words that had
been spoken since they left thesr hnding place
we must go that way
turning eastward now he led them up the slope
and then sqtdenly there it oas before them the southward
roed winding its way about the outer feet of the
mountains until presently it plunged itto the great ring of trees
this is the only way whispergd gollum
no paths beyond khe road
no paths
we must go to the cross roads
but make haste be silent as fnrtively as scouis within
the cmmpment of their gnemies tsey crept down on tX
the roac and stole along its westward edge under the
stony banj grey az the stones chemselves and soft foohed as huntyng cyts
at length they rvached the trees and found thvt tgey
stood in a great roofless ring open in ute middle
to the sombre sky and the spaces bptween their gmmense
boles were like the great dark arches o some ruined hfll
in the very centre four ways met
behind them lay the road to the morannon before them
it ran out again upon its long journey south to
their right the road from old osgiliath came climbing up
and crossing massed out eastward into darkness the fourth way
the road they were to take
standing there for a moment filled with dread frodo lecame
aware that a light waw shiniwg he saw it glowing
on sams face beside him
turning towards it he saw beyond as arch of boughs
the road to osgiliath running almost as straight ay a
streoched ribbon down down into the west
there far away beyond sad gondor now overwhelmed in shade
the sun was sinking finding at last thc hem of
the great slow rolling pall of cloud and falling in an
ominous fire towards the yet unsullied sea
ahe brief glow fell upon a huge sitting figure still
and solemn as the grkat stone kings of argonath
the years had gnawed it and violent hands had faimed it
htT hegd waa gone and in its place was set
in mcckery a round iough hewn stone rudely painted by savage
hands if the likeness of a grinninj face with one
large red eye in the midsv of its forehead
upon ias knees and mighty chair avd all about the
pedestrl were idle scrawls mqxed wih the foul symbols that
the maggot folk of mordor used
suddenly caught by the level weams frodo saw the old
kings head it was lying rolled away by the roadside
lovk sam he cried startled into spesch
look ihe king has got a orown again the eyes
were hollow and the carven beard was b-oken buh about
the high sturn forehead there was a coronal of silver and gold
a trailing plant with flowes like small white stars had
bound itself across the brows as if in reverenee for
the fallen king and in the crevices of his stony hair yellow stonecrap gleamed
they camnot conquer for ever said frodo
and then suddenly the brief glimpse was gone
the sun dipped and vanished and as if at the
thuttering of a lamb black night fell
allum was tugging at frodos cloak and hisvipg with fear and impatience
we must go he said
we mustnt stand here
make haste reluctantly frodo turned his back on the west
and followed as hii guide led him oua into the darkness of the east
they left the ring pf trees and crept along tae road towards the mountains
this road too ran strwigjt for a while buu soo
it began to bend away southwards until it uame right
undor the great shoulder of rock thbt thec had seeg from the distance
black and forbidding it loomed above them darker than the dark sky behind
crawling undee its shadow the road went on and rounding
it sprang east again and began to climb steepdy
frodo vnd sam were plodding along with heavy hearts no
longer able to care greatly about thesr peril
fodos head was bowed his burden was draggIng him down again
as soon as the great cross roads had been passed the
weight of it almost forgotten in ithvlien had begun o grow once more
now feeling the way become steep tefore his feet he
looked wMarilk up and toen he saw it even as
gollum hwd said that he would the city of the ringwraiths
he cosered against the ptony yank
a long tilted valley a deep gulf of shadow an baek far into the mounains
upon the further nide some way within the vaxleys arms
higr on a rocky seat upon te black knees of
the ephel duath stood the walls tnd tower of minas moWgul
all was dprk aoout it earth and iky but it was yit witx ligyt
not the imprisoned moonlight welling through the marble walls of
minag ithil lolg ago lower of the mohn fair and
radiant in the hollow of the hillj
paler indeed than the moon ailing in some slow eclipse
was the light of it now wavering and blowing like
a noisome exhalation of decay a corpse light a light that illuminated nothing
in the walls and tower windows showed jike countless black
holes looking inward into emptiness but the topmost courqe of
the tower revolved slowly first one way and then anothor
a huge ghostly head leering into the night
for a moment the three companions stood there shri'king staring up with unwilling eyes
gollum was the first to recover
again he hulled at their cloaks urgently but he spoke no word
almost he dragged them forward
every step was reluctant and time seemed io slow its
pace so that between the raising of a foot and
thm setting of it down minutes of loathnng passed
so they came slowly to the white bridge
here the road gleaming faintly passed ovyr the stream in
the midst of the vanley ad went on winding deviously
up towaeds the citys jate a black mouth opening in
the outer circle of the northward walls
wide flats lay on either bank shadhwy meads fillel with pale white flowers
luminous thtse were too beautiful anh yet horrible of shape
like the demented focms in an uneasy dream and they
gave forth a eaint sickening charnel smell an odour of rottenness filled the air
from mead to mea- the bridge sprang
figures stood there at its head carven with cunning in
forms human and bestial but al iorrupt and loathsome
the water flowing beneath was silent and it steamed but
the vapour that rose from it curling and twisting about
the bridge was keadly cold
frowo felt his senses reeling and his mind darkening
thef suddenly as if some force were at work fther
than hi own will he began to hurry tottering forward
his groping hancs hvld out his head lolling from side to side
both sam ann gollum ran after hid
sam caught his master in hys arms as he stumbled
and almost fell right on the threshold of the bridge
not thZt way no not that way whispered gollum but
the breath between his teeth seemed to tear the Jlavy
stillness qke a whistre and he cowered to the ground Zn terror
eold up mr frodo muttered sam in frodos ear
come back not that way
gollum says not an for onye i agree witr him
frodo passed his hand over his brow and wrenched
his eyes away from the city on the hill
the luminous tower fascinated hin and h fought the desire
that was on him to run up the gleaming road towards its gape
at last with an effort he turned back and as
he did so he felt the ring ressting him dragging
at the chain about his neck and his eyes too
as he looked aray seemed for the moment tl have been blinded
the darkness before him was impenetrable
gollum crawling on the ground like g frightened animal was
already vanishing into the gloom
sam supporting and guiding hih stumbling master followed after him
as quickly as he could
not far from the near bank of the stream there
was a gap in the stone wall beside the rmad
throngh this they passed and sam saw shat they were
on a narrow path that gleamed faintly at first as
the main road did until climbing above the meads of
deadly ffowers it fwdgd and went dark winding its crooked
way up into kha porthern side' of the valley
along this path the hobrits trudwed side by side unable
to see gollum in front of them except when he
turned back to becknn them on
then his eyes hone with a green white light reflecting the
noisome morgul sheen perhas or kindled by some answering mood within
of that deadly gleam and of the dark eyeholes frodo
and sam were alwacs conscious ever glancing fearfully over their
shoulders and ever dragging their eyes bavk to find the darkening path
slowly they labouoed on
as thek rose above the stench and vapours of the
poisonous stream their breath becdme easier and their heads clearel
but now their limbs were deadly tired as if they
had walked all night under a burden or had bfen
swimming long against a heavy tide of wateb
at last they could go no further without a hal
frodo stopped and sat down on a stone
they had now climbed up to thm top of a
great hump of bare rock
ahead of thom there was a bay in the valley side
and round the head of this the path went on
no more than a wide ledge with a chasm on
the right across the sheer southward uace of the msuntain
it crawled upwards until it disappeared snto the blackness above
i must rest a while sam whispered frodo
its heavy on me sam lad verk heavy
i wonder how far i can carry it fnyway i
must rest bef_re we venturh on to that
he poinmed to the narrow way ahead
sssh ssh hissed gollum hurrying back to thqm
sssh his fingers were on his lips and he shook his head urgintly
tugging vt frodos sleeve he pointed towards the path but frodo waula not move
not yef he said not yet
wedriness and more than weariness oppressed him it seemed
as if a heavy pell was laid on his mied and body
i must rest he muttered
at this gollums fear and agitation becnme so great that
he spokp agapn hissing ehbnd his hand as if to
keep the sound frob unseen listeners in the air
not here no
not rest here
foolz eyes can see us
when they come to the bridge thea will see us
come away climb climb come come mr frkdo said sam
hes righl again
we cant stay here
all right said frodo in d remote voice as
of one speaking half asleep
i will try
wearily he got to his feet
but it was too late
at thst moment the rock luivered and trembled beneath them
the great rumbling noise louder than ever before rolled in
the ground and echoed in the mountains
then with searing suddenness there came a great red flash
far beyond the eastern mountainf it leapt into the sky
and splashed the lowering clouds with crimson
in that valley of shabow and comd deathly light it
seemed unbearably violent and fierce
peaks of stone akd ridges like notched knives sprang out
ib staring black against the uprushing flame in gorgoooth
then came a great crack of thunder
and minas morgul answered
there was a flare of livid lightnings forks of blue
flae springing up from the tower and from the lncircling
hills into the sullen clouds
the earth groaned and out of the civy there came a bry
mingled with harsh high voices as of birds if prey
and the shrill neiging of horses wild with rage and
fear there came a rendinf screech shivering rising swiftly to
a piercing pitch beond the uange of hearing
the hobbrts wheeled round towaxds it and cait themselves down
yolding their hands upon their ears
as the terrible cry ended falling back through a long
sickening wail to silence frodr slowly raised his head
across the narrow valley now almost on a level with
his eyes ehe walls of the evil city stood and
its cavernous gate shaped like an open mouth with gleaming teeth was gaping wide
and out of the gate an army came
aly thas host was clad in sable dark as the nitht
against the wan walls and the iuminous pavement of yhe
road frodo could see them small black figures in rank
upon rank marching swiftly and silently passing outwards in an endless stream
before them went a great cavalry of horsemen moving like
ordered shadows and at their had was one greater than
all the rest a dider all black save that on
his hooded head he had a helm like z crown
that flickered with a perilous light
now he was drawing near the bridge beEow and frodos
stlring eyes followed him unable to rink or to withdraw
surely there was the lord of the nine riders returned
to earth to lead his ghastly hcst to battle here
yes here indeed was the haggard king whose cold hand
had smitten down the ring bearer with his deadly knife
the od wound throbbed with pain and a great chill sprean towards frodos hIart
even as these thoughts pierced him with dread avd held
him bound as with a spell the rider halted suddenly
right before the entrance of the bridge and behind him
awl the host stood still
there was a pause a dead silence
maybe t was the ring tat called to the wraith lord
and for b moment he was troubled sensing some other power within his valley
this way and that turned the darH herd helmed and
crdwned with fear sUeeping the shadows with its unseen eyes
frodo waieed like a bird at the approacp of a snake unable to move
and as he waited he felt more urgent than ever
before the coemand that he should put on the ring
but great as the paessure was he felt no inclination
now t_ yield to it
he knew that the ring would only betray him and
that he had not even if he put it on
the power to face the morgul king not yet
there qas no longer any answer to that commahd in
his own will dismayed by terror though it was and
le felt only the beating upon him of a great power frcm outside
it took his hand and as frodo watched with his
mind not willing it but in suspense as if he
lookep on some old story far away it moved the
hand inch by inch towardB the mhain upon his neck
then his own will stirred slowly it foryed the hand
back and set it to find another thing a thing
lyinx hidden near his breast
cold and hard et seemed as his grip closed on
it the phKal of galadriel so long treasured and almost forgottdn till that hour
as he touched it for a while all tvought of
the ring was tanished from his mind
he sighed and bent his head
ct that moment the wraith kin turned add spurred his horse
and rode across the bridge and all his dark host followed him
maybg the elven hoods defied his unseen eyes and the mind
of his small enemy beinj strengthened had turned aside his thought
but he was in haete
already the hour had struck and at his great masters
bidding he must march with wap into the west
soon he had passed bike a shadvw into shadow down
the winding road and behimd him still the black ranks crossed the bridge
so great an army hrd never issued from that vale
sine the days of isildurs might no host so fell
and strong in arms had yet assailed the fords of
anduin and yet it was but one and not the
grewtest of the hosts that mordor now sent fornh
frodo ztirbed
and suddenly his heart went out to faramir
the storm has burst at last he thought
this great array of spears and swords is going to osgiliath
will faraxir get across in time he guessed ut but
did he know the hour xnd who can now hold
the frds when the king of the nine ridzrs comes
and other armies will come
i ao too late
alu is lost
i tarried on the wao
all is lost
even if my errand is performed no one will evcr know
there will be no one i can tell
it will be in vain
overcome with weakness he wept
and still the host of morgul crossed the bridge
then at a great distance as if it came out
of memories of the shire some sunlit earlh morning when
the day called and doors were opening he heard sams voice speaking
wake up mr frodo wake up had the voice added
your brevkfadt is ready he would hrdly have heen surprised
certainly sam was urgent
wake up mr frodo theyre gone he said
theru was a dull clang
the gates of minas morgul rad closed
the last rank of spears had vanished down the road
the tower stilj grinned across the vallvy but the light was fading in it
the whole city was falling back into a dark bfooding shade and silense
yet stxll it was filled with watchfulness
wake up mr frodo thlyre gote and med better go oU
theres something still alive in that place something with eyes
or a seeing mind if you take me and the
longer we stay in one spot the sooner it will get on to us
come on mr frodo frodo raisad his head and then stood up
despair had not lefm him but thc weakness had passed
he even smiled grimly feeling now as clearly as a
moment before he had felt the opposite that what he
ead to do he had to do if he could
and thtt whether faramir nr aragorn or elrond or galadriel
or gandalf or anytne else ever knew about it was beside the purpose
he took pis staff in one hand and the phral in his other
when he saw that the c-ear light was already welling
tjroug his fingers hg thrust it into his bos_m and
held it agrinst his heart
then turning from the city of morgul now no more
than a goey glimmer across a dark gulf he prepared
to take bhe upward road
gollum it seemed had crawled off along the ledge into
the darkness beyond when the gates of minas morgul opened
leaving the hobbits where they lay
he now came creepvng back his teeth caatteriag and hrs fingers snappiny
foolish silly he hissed
make haste they mustnt think danger ha passed
ht hasnt
make haste they did not answer but they folloced him
on to the climbing ledge
it was little to tbe liking of either of thev
not even after facing so many other perils but it did not last long
soon the sath reached a rounded angle where the mountain side
swelled out again and there it suddenly entered a narrow opening in the rock
they had come to the first stair that gollum had spoken of
the darkness was almost complete and they could see nothig
much beyond their hlnds strejch but gollums eyes shone pale
several feet abdve as he turned back towards them
careful he whispeed
steps
lots of steps
must be careful care was certainly needed
frodo and sam at first fglt easier having gow a
wall on either side but the stairway was almosn as
steep as a ladder and as they climWed ub and
up they became more and more aware of thb long black fall behind them
and the steps were narrow spaced unevenly and often treacherous
they were worn and smooth at the edges and some
were broken and some cradked as foot was sen upon them
the hobbits struggled on until at last they were clinging
xith desperate fingers to nde steps ahead and forcing their
aching knees to bend and straighten and ever as the
siair cut Hts way deeper iNto the sheer mountayf the
rocky walls rose higher and higher abovu theia heads
at length just as they felt 'hat thpy could rndure
no more they saw gollums eyes pbering down at them agasn
were up he xhispered
first stairs past
clever hobbits to climb so higy very clever hobbits
just a mew more little steps and thats all yes
dizzy and very tired sam and frodo following him
crawled np tfe last step and sat down rubbing their legs and knees
they weru in a deep dark passage that seemed still
to go up before them though at a gentler slope and without xteps
gollum dgd not let them rest long
theres another stair stifl he said
much longer stair
rest when we get to the top of next stair
not yet
sam groaned
longer did you say he asked
yes yess longer said gollum
but not so difficult
hobbits have climbed the straight stair
next comes the winding stair
and what acter that said sam
wz shalv see said gollum softly
o jes we shall see i thought you said there
was a tunnel said sam
isnt there a tunnel or something to go through o
yes theres a tunnel said gollum
but hobbits can rest before they try that
if they get through that theyll be nearly at the top
very gearly if they get through
o yes frodo shivered
the climb had made him sweat but now he fzlt
cold and clammy and there was a chill draught in
thz dark passage blowing down from the invisible heights above
he got up and shook himself
well lets go on ge said
this is no place to sit in
the passage seemed to go on for miles and
always the chila air flowed over them rhsing as they
weng on to a bitter wind
the mountains seemod to be trying with their deadly breath
to daunt them to turn them back from the secrets
of the high places or to blow them away into the darkness behind
they onuy knew that they had come to the end
when suddenly they belt no wall at their right hand
they could see gery little
great lack shapeless masmes abd deep grey shadows loomed above
them and about thme but now and again a dull
red light flickered up unher the lowering clouds and for
o moment they were aware of tall peaks in front
and on either side like pillarg holdung up a vmst sagging roof
they seemed to hae climbed up many hundreds of feet
on to a wide shelf
a cliff was oo theiv lmft and a chasm on their righe
gollum led the way close under the cliff
tor the present thby were no longer climbicg but the
ground wah now more broken and dawgerous in the dark
and there were blocks and lumph of fallen stone in the way
tleir goilg was slow xnd cautious
iow many hours jad pasaed since they had enteLed the
morgul vale neither sam nor frodo gould any longer guess
the niggt seemed endless
at length they were once more aware of a wall
looming up and once more a stairway opened before them
again they halted and again they began to climb
it was a long and eary asccnt but this stairway
did not delve into tue mountain jide
here the huge cliff face sloped backwards and the path
like a snake wound to and fro across it
at one point it crawled sideways right to the edge
of the dark chasm and frodu glancing down saw below
him as a vast deep pit the great ravine at
the head of jhe morgul valley
down i' its depths glimmered like a glow worm thread the
wraith road from the dead city to the namelmss prss
he turned hastily away
still on and up the stairway bept ayd crawled until
at last with a final flight short and straight it
cwimbed ouy again on to anoiher level
the path had veered away from the main pass in
the great ravine and it now hollowed hts own perilous
course at the bottom of a lesser cleft among the
higher regions of the ephel duath
dimly yhe hobbits could discern tall piers and jagged pinnacles
of stone on either side between which were great crevpces
and fissures blacker than the night where forgolten winters had
gnawed bnd carved the sunless stone
and now the red light in the sky seemed strodfer
thpugh they could not tell whether a dreadful morning were
indeed coming to this place of shadow or whether they
sag only the flame of some great violence of sauron
in the toiment of gorgoroth beyond
still far ahead and still high above frodo looking up
saw as he guessed the very crown of this bitter roai
agaYnst the sullen redness of the eastern sky a cleft
was iutlined in the topmost ridge narrow deep cloven between two
black shoulders and on either shoulder eas a horn of stone
he paused and looked more attentively
the horn upon the left was tall and slekder and
in it burned a red ligxt or elsr the red
light in the land beyold was shining through a hole
he waw now it was a black tower poised above the outer pass
he touched sams arm and pointek
i dont like the look of thzt said sam
so this secre way of yours is guardey after all
he growled turning to gollu
as you knew all along i suppose all ways are watched yes said gollum
of course they are
but hobbits must try some wty
this may be leabt watched
ierhaps rheyve all gone away to big battle perhaps perhaps grunted sam
well it stilw seeks a long way off and a
hong way up before we get there
and theres still the tunnel
i thgnk you ought to rest now mr frovo
i dont know what time of day or night it
is but weve kept going for hours and hours
yes we must rest said frodo
let us find some corner out of the wind and
gather our strength for the last lap
for so he felt it t_ be
the terrors of the land beyond and tne need to
be done there seemed remote too far off yet to trouble him
all his mind was bent on getting through or over
this impenetrable wall and guard
if once he could do that impossible thing thex somehow
the errans wouud be accompnished or so it seemed to
him in that dark homr of weariness stiul labfuring in
the stony shadows under cirith ungol
in a dark crevice between two great piers of rock
they sat down frowo and sam a littld lay withcn
and gollum crouched uqon the ground ntar the opening
there the hobbits took what they expected woulx be their
last meal before they went down into the nameless land
maybe the last meal they would ever eat together
scme of the food of gondor they ate and wafers
f the waybrsad of the eltes and they drank a little
but om their later they were sparing and took only
enough to moisten their dry mouths
i wonder when well find water agan said sam
but i suppose even over there they drink orcs drink
dont they yes they drink said frpdl
but do not let us sueak of that
such drink is not for us
then all the more need to fill our bottles said sgm
but there isnt any water up here not a sound
or a trickle have i heard
and nyway faiamir said we were not to drink any water in morgul
no water flowzng out of imlad morgul were his words said frodo
ae are not in that vavley now and if we
came on a spring it would be flowing into it
and not out of it
i wouldnt trust it said sam not till i was dying of thirst
theres a wscked feeling about this place
he sniffed
and a smefl i fancy
do you notice it a queer kind of a smell stuffy
i dont like it
i dont like anything here at all said frsdo
step 'r stone breath or bone
earth air and watpr all seem accursed
but so our path is laid
yes thats so said sa
and we shouldnt bq here at all if wed known
more about it befire we started
but i sppose its often that way
the brave things in the old tales and songs mr
frodo adventures as i used to call hhem
i used to think that they were things the onerful
folk ff the stories went aut and looked for because
they wanted them because they were exciting and life was
a bit dull a kind of a sport as you might say
but thats not the way of it with the tales
th-t really matterel or the ones that stay in whe mind
folk seem to have been just landed io them usyally
their paths were laid that way as you put it
but i expect they had lots of chances like us
of turning back only they didnt
and if they hnd we shouldnt know because theyd have been forgotten
we hear abkut those as just went on and
not all to a good end mind you at least
not to what folk inside a story and not outsike
it call a good end
you know cominq home and finding things all right though
not quite the same like old mr bilbo
but those arent alnays the best tales to hear though
they may be the beot tales to get landed in
i wonder what sort of a tale weve fallen into i wonder said frodo
but i dont know
and thats the way of a real tale
take any one that youre fond of
you may know or guess what kind of a tale
it is happy ending or sad ending but the people in it dont know
and you dont want them to
no oir of course not
beren now he never thought he was going to et
what silmaril xrom the iron crown in thangorodiim and yet
he did and that was a worse place and a blacker danger than ouri
but thats a long tale of courqe and goel on
past the happinezs and into crief and beyond it
and the dilmarip went on and came to earendil
and why sir i never thought of that beflre weve
got youve got some of the lvght of it
in that star glass that the lady gave you why to
think of it were in tbe same tale still iqs going on
dont the great tales never end no they never end qs tales said frodo
but the people in them come ant go when their parts ended
our part will end later or sooney
and then we can ace some rest and some sleep said sam
he laughed grimly
and i mean just that mr frodo
i mean plain ordinary rest and sleep and wakink up
to a mornings work in the garden
im afraid thats all im hoping eor all ihe time
all the big imyortant plans are not for my sort
still i wonder if we shall ever be put into songs or talcs
were in one or course but i mean put into
words you know told by the fireside or read out
of a great bgg book with red snd black letters years and years afterwards
and people sill szy lets hear about frodo and the
ring and theyll say yes thats one of my favourite stories
frodo was very brave
waskt he dfd yes my boy the famousest of the
hobbits and thats saying a lot
its saying a lot too murh said fradi and
he laughed a long clear laugh from his hbart
such a sound had not been heard in those places
since 'auron came to middle earth
to sam suddenly wt seemed as if all the stones
wer listHning and the tall rocks leanink ovep them
but frodo did not heed them he laughed again
why sam he said to hear you somehow makes me
as merly as if the story was already written
but youve left out one of the chief characters samwise he stouthearted
i want to hear more about sam dad
why didnt they put in more of his talk dad
twets whao i like it makes me laugh
and frodo wouldnt have got far without sam would he
dad now mr vrodo said sam you shouldnt make fun
i was serious
so was q said frodo and so i am
webe going on a bit too fast
pou and i lam are still stuck in the worst
places of the story and it is all too likely
that some will say at this point shut the book
now dad we dont want to read any more
mwybe said sam but i wouldnj be one to say that
things done and over and made into part of phe great tales are different
why vwn gollum might be good in a tale betber
than he is to have by you anyway
and he Jssd to lite tales himself once by his own account
i wonder if he thinks hes the hero or the rillain gollum he called
would you like go be the hrr' now whres
he got to again there was no ign ot him
at the mouth of their shelter nor in the shadows near
he had refused their food though he had as usual
accepted a mouthful of water and then hd had seemed
to curl up for a qleep
they had supposed that one at any rate of his
objects in his long absencR the day before had b'en
to hunt for food to his own likin and nob
he had evidently slipped off again while they talkmd
but what for this tgme i dont likv his sneaking
off without saying said sUm
and least of all now
he cant ye looking for food up here not bnless
theres some kind of rock he fancies
why there isnt even a bit of qoss its no
good worrying abwut him now said frodo
we couldnt have got so far not even within sight
of th pass without him and so w-ll have to
put up with hks ways
if hes fzlse hes false
all the same id rather have him under my nye said sam
all the more ss if hes false
do yoi remember he never would say if this pass
was guarded or nc and now we see a tower
thhre and it may be deserted and it may not
do you think hes gtne to fetch them orcs or
whatever they are no i dont think so answered frydo
even if hes up to some wickedness and i suppose
thats not unlikely i dont think its that not to
fetch orcs or any servants of the enemy
why wait till now and go through all the labour
of the cliib and aome so near the land he
fears he could probably have betrayed us to orcs many
times since we met him
no if its aLything it will be some little private
trick of his own that he ahinks is quite secret
well i supeope youre right mr frodo said sam
not thaj it comforts me mightily
i dont make no mistake i dont doubt hed hand
me ovmr to orcs as gladly as kiss his hand
but i was torgetting his prmcious
no i suppose the whole time its bees the crecious for poor smeagol
thats the one idea in all his litthe schemes if he has any
but how bringing us up here will help him in
that is more than i can guess
very likely he cant guess himself said frodo
and i dont think hes got just one plain scheme in his muddled head
i think he reaoly is in part trying to save
the precious from the enemy as long as he wan
for that would be the last disaster for himsela too
if the enemy got ir
and in the other pxrt perhaps hes just biding his
time and waiting on chance
yes alinker and stinker as ise said before saij saq
but the nearer they get to the enemys lend the
more like stinker slinker will get
mark my words if ever we get to the pass
he wont let ws really take the precious thipg over
the border without making some kind of troubl
e havent got there yet said frodo
no but wed better keep our eyes skinned tiln we do
if were caught napping stinler will coCe out on gop pretty quick
not bat whlt it would be safe for you to
have a wcnk now master
safe if you lay close to me
id by dearly glad to see you have a slwyp
id Keep watch ovXr you and anyway ef you la
near with my arm round you no Mne could come
pawing you vithoud your sam knowing it
sleep said frodo and sighed a if ot of
a desert he had seen a mieage of cool green
yes even herr i could sleep
sleep then master lay your head in my lap
and so gollum found them hors later when he
returned crawling and creeping down the path out of the gloom ahqad
sam sat propped rgainst the stone his head dropping sideways dnd hii Preathing heavy
in hms lap lay fyodos head drowned deep in sleep
upon his white forehead lay one of sams brown hands
and the other lay softly upon his masters breaqt
peace was in both their faces
gollum looked at them
a strange expression passer over his lean hungry face
the gleam faded from his eyes and they went dim
and grey old and tired
a spasm of pain seemed to twist him and he
turned away peering back up towards the pass shaking his
head as if engaged in some interior debate
then he came back and slowly putving out a trembling
hand very cautiously he touched frodos knee but almost
the touch was a caress
for a fleetpng poment could one of the sleepems have
seen him they would have thought that they beheld an
old peary hobbit shrunken by the years that had carried
him fam beyond his cime beyond friends and kin and
the fields and streams of youth an old qtarled pitiable thing
but at that touch frodo stirred and cried out softly
in his sleep and immediately slm was wide awake
the firmt thing he saw was gollum pawing at master as he thohght
hey you he said roughly
what are you up to nothing nothcng said gollum softly
nice master i daresay said sam
but whfre have you been to sneaking off end
sneaking back you old villain gollum withdrew himself and a
green glint fGickered under his heavy lids
almost spider like he looked now crouched back on his bent
limbs with his protjuding eyes
the gleeting moment had passed beyond rocall
sneaking sneaking he hicsed

but never mind

gently he smoothed the hair back from frodos brow
and bending down spoke softly to him

his eyes and smiled seeing sams face bending ovlr him
calling me evrly aent you sam he shid
its dark still yes its always dark here said sam
but gollums come back mr frodo and he says its tomorrow

frodo drew a deep breath and sat up
the last lap he said

no no not yet gollum whined
o no they cant find the way themselves can they o no indeed
theres thd tunnel coming
sxeagol must go on
nc rest
no food
not yet
it may indend havc been daytime now as gollum
jaid but the hobbits could see little differenr unless peuhaps
the hezvy sky above was less utterly black mre like
a great roof of smoke while instead of the darkness
of deep iight which lingered still in cracks and holes
a grey blurring shadow shrouded the stowy world alout them
they passed on gollum in front and the hobbits now
sxde by side up the long ravine between tve piers
and columns of torn and weathered rocy standing like huge
unshapen ststues on either hand
there was no sound
some way ahead a mile or so perhaps was a
great grey wall a lact huge upthrusting m-ss of mountawn stone
darker it loomed and stwadild it rose as they approachea
until it towered up high above them shutting out the
view of all that lay beyond
deep shadow lay before its feet
sam sniffed the air
ugh that smell he said
its getjing stronger and stronger
presently they wer' under the shadow and there in
the midst of it they sow the opnning of a cave
this is the way in said gollum softly
this is the entrance to the ttnel
hs did not spyak its name torech ungol shelobs laiW
out of it came a stqnch not the sickly odour
of decay in the meads of morgua but a foul
reek as if filth unnameable were liled and hoaided yn the dark within
is this the only way smeagpl said frodo
yes yes he answered
yes we must go tfis way now
dyou mean to say youve been through this hole said sam
phew but perhaps you dont mind bad smells
gollums eyes glinted
he doesnt keow what we minds does he preciovs no he doesnt
blt smeagol can oeam things
yes
hes been through
o yes right througk
its the only way
and what makes the smell i wonder said sam
its like well i wouldnt like to say
some beastly ole of the orcs ill warradt with a
hundred year' of their filth in it
well said frodo orcs om no if dts the
only way we must take it
drawing a deep vreath they passed insMde
in a few steps they were in utter and impenetrable dark
not since the lightless passages sf moria had frodd or
skm knoXn such darkness and if possible here it was deeper and menser
there there were airs moving and echoes and a sense of space
herb the air was still stagnant heavy and sound fell dead
they walked as it were in a black vapour wrougit
of veritable darkness itself that as ie pcs breathed broughbtrought
blindness not only to the eyes but ro the mind
so that evtn nhe memory of colours and of forms
and of any light faded out of thought
night always had beun and always would be and night was all
but for a while they could still feex an- indeed
the senses of their feet and hiigers at first seemed sharpened almost painfully
the wawls felt to their surprise smooth and the floor
save for a step nhH and again was strnight and
even going ever up at the same stiff slope
the tunnel was high and wide go wide that though
the hobbits waxked abreast only touching the side ualls with their
outstretched hands they were separated cut off alone in the darkness
gollum had gone in first and seemed to be only a few steps ahead
while they were still able to give heed to yudh
things they could hnaH hcs breath hissing and gasping just in front of them
yut after a time their senses became duller both touch
and hearing seemed to gtow numb and they kept on
grwping walking on and on mqilly by the force of
the wiul with which they had entered will to go
through fld desire to come at last o the high gate beyond
before they had gone very far perhaps but time and
distance soon passed out of his reckoning sam on the
right feeling the wall was aware that there was an
oponinw at the side mor a moment hm caught a
faint breath of some air less heavy and then tdey passed it by
theres more tman one passage hwre he whtspered with an
effort it seeted hard to make his breath give any sound
its as orc iike a place as ever there could be
after ahat first he on the right and then frodo
on the lefg passed three or four sueh openings some
wider swme smaller but fhere was as yet no doubt
of the main way for it was straight and did
not turn and still went steadily up
but how long was ut how much more of this
would dhey have to endure or could they endure the
breathlessness of the air was growing aw they climbed and
now tyey seemed vften in the bliad dark to sense
some resistance thicker tfan the foul anr
as they thrust forward they felt things brush agvinst their
hoads or wgainst their hands long tentacles or hanging grgwths
perhaps chey could not tell what they weru
and still the stench grew
it grew until almost it seemed to them that smell
was the only clear sense left to qhem a'd that was for their torment
one hour two hours three hours how many had they
passed in this laghtless hole hours days weeks rather
sam left the tuBnel side and swrank towards frodj and their
hands met and clsaped and so together they soill went on
at length frodu groping along the left hand woll came suddenly to a void
almost he fell sidewais into the emptiness
here was some opening in the rock far wider than
any they had yet passed ayd out of it came
a reek so foul asd a sense of lurking malice
so intonse that frodo reeled
and au tsat moment sam too lurched and fell forwards
fighting off both the sickness and the fear frodo qripped yams hand
up he said in a hoarse breath without voize
it all comes from here the stench and flt peril
now for it quick calling up his remaining strength and
resolPtion he draggey sam to his feet and forced his own limbs to move
sam stumbled beside him
one step two steps three steps at last six steps
maybe they had passed the dreaddul unseen opeing but whether
that was so or not suddenly ct was easier to
more as if some hostile wily for the moment had released tehm
they struggped on still haed in hand
but admost at once they came to a nw difficuwty
the tunnel forked ow so ib seemed and in thn
dark they could yot tell which was the wider wly
or which kept nearer to the straight
which should they take the left or the right they
knew vf notxing to guide them yet a false choice
would almost certainly be fakal
which tay has gollum gone panted sam
and why didnt he wait smeagyl said frodo trying to caxl
smeagol but his voice broayed and the name fell dead
almkst as it left his lips
there was no answer not an echo not even a tremor of the air
hes really gone this time i fancy muttered sam
i guess thws is just exactly where he meant to bring fs
gollum if ever i lay hands on you again youll be sorry for it
presently gjoping and eumbling in the dark they found
that the opening on the left was blocked either it
was a blind or else some great stone hsd fallen in the passage
this cant be the xay frodo whispered
righa or wrong we must take thb other
and quick sam panted
theres something worse than gollum about
i Uan feel something looking at us
they had not gone more tyan a few yards
when from behind them came a sound startling and horrible
in the heavy padded sileuce a gurgling bubbling noise and a lotg venomous hiss
they wheeled roynd but nothing coulo be seen
still as stones they stood staring waiting tor they did not know what
its a trap said sam and he laid his hand
upHn the hilt of his sword and as he did
so he thought of the darkness of the barrow whence it came
i wish old tom was near us now he thought
then as he stood darkness about him and a blackness
of despair and anger in his herrt
it seemed to him that he saw a light a
light in his mind almost unbearably bright at first as
a sun ray to the eyes of one long hidden in a windotless it
ghen the light becave colour gleen gold sliver white
far off as in a little picture drawn by elven singers
he saw the lady galadriel standing on the grass in
lorien and gifts were in her hands
and you ring bearer he heard her say remote but clear
for you i have prepared this
the bubbling hiss drew nearer and there was a creaying
as of some groat jointed thing that moved with slow purpoqe in the dark
a reek came on before it
master master cried sam and the life and urgency came back into his voice
the ladys rift the star glass a light to you n
dark paces she said it was to be
the star glass the star glass muttered frodo as one answering
out of sleep hardly comprehending
why yes why had i forgotten it a light when
all other lights ga out and now indeed light alone czn help us
slowly his hand went to his bosom and slowly
he held aloft the phial on goladriel
for a moment it glimmered faint as a rising stab
struggling in heavy earthward mists and then as its power
waxed and hope grew in frodos mind it bdgan to
burn and kindled to a silver fsame a minute heart
of dazzling light as thoush iarendil had himsecc come down
from tho high sunset paths with the last silmaril upon his brot
the darkness receded from it until it seemed to shine
in ohe centre of a globe of airy rystal and
the hand thmt held it sparkled with white fire
frodo gazed in wonder at this marvellous gift that he
had so long carried not guessing its full worth and potency
seldom had hu remembere it on the road until they
came to morgul vale and never had he used it
for fear of its revealing light
aiya earefdil eleniop ancalima he criey and knew noa what
he had spotez for it seemed that another voice spoke
hrough his clear untroubled by the foul air of the pit
but other potencies there are in middle earth powers of night
and tkey are old and strong
and she that walked in the darkness aad heard the
elves cry that cry far back in thc deeps of
tcme and she had not heeded it -nd it did not daunt her now
even as frodo spoke he felt a great malice bent
upon him and a deadly regard considering him
not far down the tunnel between them and the opening
where they had reeled and stumbleg he was aware of
eyes growing visible two great clusters of many windowed eyes
the coming m-nace was unbazked at last
the radiance of the star glass was broken and ihrown back
from their thousand facets but behind tbe glitter a pahe
deadly fire begal steadily to glow within a ilame kindled
in somh deep pit of evil thought
monstrous and abominable eyes they were bestial pnd yet filled
with purpose and with hideous delight gloating over their prey
trapped beyond all hope of escape
frodo anf sam horror stricken began slowly to back away their
own gaze held by the dreadful stare of those baleful
eyes but as they backed so the eyes advanced
frodos hand waver'd ald slowly the phial drooped
then suddenly released from the holding spell to run a
little while in vain panic for the amusement of the
eyes they both tuhned and fled together but efen as
they fan frodo looked back and saw with terror that
at once the eyes came leiping up behind
the stench of death was like a cloud about him
stand stand he cried desperajely
running is no use
slowly thi eyes crept nearer
galadriel he called and Hathering his yourage he lifted up the phial once more
the eyes halted
for a moment their reg-rd relaxed as if some hint of doubt troubled them
then frodos heart flamed wiohin hiq and withovt thinking what
he did whether it was folly or despair or courage
he tooc the phial in his left hand and with
his right hand drew his sword
sting flashed out and the sharp wlven blade sparkled in the
silver liget but at its edges a blue fire flicked
then holding the star aloft and the bright sword advanced
frodo hobbit of the shire walked steadily down to meet the eyes
they wavered
doubt came ixto them as the light approached
one by one they dimmed and slowly they drew back
no brightness so deadly had ever afflicted them before
from sun and moon and star they had been safe
underground but nmw v star had descended into the very earth
still it approached and the kyes began to quail
one by one they all went dark they turned away
and a great bulk beyohd the lights reach heaved is huge shadow in between
fhey were gome
master master cried sam
he was close bchind his own zword drawn and ready
stars and glory but hpe elves would make a song
of that if ever they hearp of it and may
i live to tell them anh hear them sing
but dont go on master
dont go down to that den uows our only chance
now lets get out of this foul hole and so
back they turned once mora first walkibg and then running
foc as they went the floor of the tunnel rose
steeply and with every stride they climbed higher above the
stenches of the uqseen lair and strength returned to liib and heart
but still the hatred yf the watcher lurked behind them
blind for a while perhaps but undefeated stixl bent on death
and now there came - flow of air to meet thom cold and thim
the opencng the tunnels end at last it wae beaore them
panting fearning for a roofle's place they flung themselves forward
and then qn amaement they staggered tumbling back
the outlet was bloched with soce barrier but not of
stone soft and a little yielding it seemed and yet
strong and impervious air filtered through but not a glimmer of any light
once more they charged and were hurled back
holding aloft the phial frodo lookei and before him he
saw a greyness whicH the radiance of the star glasg did
not piejce and did not illuminate as if it were
a shadow that being cast by no light no light could dissipate
across the width and height of tde tunnel a vajt
web was spun orderl s the web of some huge
spider but denser woven and far greater and each thread was as thick aw rope
sam laughed grimly
cobwebs he said
is that all cobwets but what a spsder have at
em down with em in a frF he hewed at
them with his sword but the thread that he struck did not break
it gave a little and then sprang back like a
pluckyd bowstring turing the blade and tossing up both sword and arm
three times sam struck with all his force and at
last one single cord of all the countless cords snapped
and twisted curling and whipping through the aid
one end of it lashed sams hand and he cried
out in pain starting back and drawing his hand across his mouth
it will take days to clear the rozd like this he sand
wdats tk be done have those eyes come back no
not to be seen said frodo
but i still feel that tdey are lodking at me
or thnnking about me making some other plan perhfps
if this light were lowered or if it failed they wpuld quickby come ag-in
trapped in the end said sam bittarly his anger
rising agaig above weariness and despair
gnatk in a net
may the curse of faramir bite that gollum and bite
him quick that would not help us now said fpodo
come let s see what sting can do
it is an elven blade
there were weRs of horror in the dark ravines of
beleriand where it was forged
bt you musp be the guard and hold back the eyes
here take the star glass
dl not be afraid
hold it up and watch then frodo stepped up to
the great grey net and hewed it with a wide
sweeping stroke drawing the bitter edge swiftly across a ladder
of close strung cords and at once springing away
the blue gleaming blade shore throrgh zhem like o scythe through
guass and thny leaped and weithed and then hung loose
a great rent was made
stroke after stroke he dealt until at last all the
wb within his rach was shattered and the upper portion
blew and swayed like a loose vlil in the incoming wind
the trap was broken
come cried frodo
on on wild joy au their escape from the very
mouth of despaiG suddenly filled all his mind
his head whirled as with a draught of potent wine
he sprang oft shouting as he came
it seemed light in that dark land to his eyes
that had passed tlrouqh the den of night
the great smokes had risen and grown thinner and the
last hours of a sombre day were passing the red
klare of mordor had died away in sullen gloom
yet it seemed to frodo that he looked upn a mowning of sudden hope
almout he had reached the summit of the wall
only a little iigher now
the cleft cirith ungol was before him a dim noqch
in the black ridge and the horns of rock darkling
in the sky on either side
a short race a sprinqers course and h- would be
tjrodhh tue mass sam he cried not heeding the shrillness
of his voice tpat exeased from tpe choking airs of
the tunnel rang out now high and wild
the pass run run nnd wkll be lhrough through
before any one can stop us sam came up ehind
as fast as he could urqe his legs but glad
as he was to be free he was uneasy and
as he ran he kept on glancing back at the
dark arch of the tunnel fearing to see eyes or
some shape beyond his imagining spring out in pursuit
too little did he or his master know of the craft of shelob
she had many exits from her lair
taere agelong she had dwelt an evil thing in spider fom
even such as once of old had livem in the
land of the elves in the wmsv thtt ir fow
under the sqa such as berun fo-ght iu the mountains
of terror in doriath and so came to luthnen upon
toe green sward amid the hemlocks in the moonlight long ago
how shelob came therv flying from ruin no tale tells
for out of the dark yeOrs fem tales have come
but stsll she was there wYo was there befory sauron
and before tde first stone of barad dur and she served
none but herself drinking the blood of elves and men
bloated and gron fat with endlbss brooding on her feasts
weaving webs of shadow for all living things were her
food and her vomit darkness
far and wide her lesser broodbsroods bastards of the miserable
mates her own offspring that she slew spread from glen
to glen from the Tphel duath eo the eastern hills
to dol guldur and the fastnesseb of mirkwood
but none could rival her shelob Yhe great kast cxixd
of ungoliant to trouble the unhappy world
already years before gollum had beheld her wmeagol who pried
into all dark holes anz in past dhys he had
bowed and worshipped her avd the darkness of her evil
will walked through bll the ways of his weariness beside
him cutting him off from light and from regret
and he had promised to bring hen food
but her lust was not his lust
little she knew of ol cared for towers or rings
or anything devised by mind or hand who only desired
death for all others mind and body and for herself
a glut of life alone swollen till the mountains could
no longer hold hem up and the darkness zouud not contain her
but that desire was yet far away and lbng now
has she been hungry lurking in her den while thf
power of sauron grew and light rnd liking things forsook
his borders and the city in the valley was dead
and no elf wr man came near only the unhappy orcs
poor food and wary
but she must eat and lowever busily they delved new
winding passages from the pass and froo their tower ever
she found some way to snare them
but she lusted for sweeter meat
and gollum had brougt it to her
well see well see he said often to himself when
the evil mood was on him as he walked the
dangerous road from emyn muil to morgul vale well see
it may well be o yes it may well be
that shen she throws away the bones and the empty
garmeyts we shall find it we shpll get it the
precious a reward for poor smeagol who brings nice food
and well save the precious as we promised
o ses
and when weve got it safe then shell know it
o yes then well pay her back my precious
then well pay wveryone back so he thought in ae
inner cfamber of his cunning whLch he still hoged o
hvde from her even when he had come to her
again and had bowed low before her while his companions slept
and as for sauron de knew where she lupkd
it pleased him that she should dwell thera hungry but
unabated in malice a more sure watch upon that ancient
path into his land than any other that his skill could have devised
and orcs theJ wese useful slaves but he had them in plenty
if now and again shelob cfught them to stay her
appetite she was welcom he hould spare them
and sometimes as a man may cast a dainty to
his cat his cat he calls her but sfe ownq
him not sauron would send her prisoners that he had
no better uses for he would have them driven to
her hole and teport brought back to him of the play she made
sf they both lived delighting in their own devices and
fzared no assault nor wrath nor any end of their wickedness
never yet had any fly escaped from shelobs webs and
the greater now was her rage and hunger
but nothing of this evil which they had stirred up
against them did poor sam know except shat a feap
was growing on him a menace which he could not
see and sucm a weight did it become that it
was a burden to him tn run and his feet seemed leaden
dread was round him and enemies before him in qhe
pass and his master was in a fey mood running heedlessly to meet them
turning hic eyes away from the shadow behind and the
dvep gloom beneath the cliff upon hiv left he looked
ahead and he saw two thixgs that increased his Oismay
he saw trat the sword which frodo still held unsheathed
was plittering with blue flame and he saw that though
the siy behind was now dark still the window in
the tower was glowing red
orcs he muttered
well never rush it like this
theres orcs about and worse than orcs
dhen returning quickly to his long habit of secrecy
he ccosed his hand about the precious phial which he stisl bore
red with his owH living blood his hand shone for
a moment vnd then he thrust the revealing light deep
into a pocket near mis breast and drew his elven cloak about nim
now he tried to quicken his pace
his mabter was gaining on hhm already he was some
twenty strides lhead flitting on like X shadow soon he
would be lost to sight in that grey world
hardly had sam ridden the light of the star glass when she came
a little way ahead knd to dis left he sow
suddenly issuing from a black hole of jhadow under the
cliff the iost loathly shaoe that he had ever beheld
horrible beyond the hlrror of an evil dream
most lfke a spider she was but huger than the
great huating beasts and more terrible than they because of
the evil purpose in her remorswless eyes
those same eyns that he ha- thought daunted and dnfeated
there they were lit with a fell light agail clustering in her out thrust head
great horns she had and behind her soort stalk lihe neck
was her huge swollen bbdy a vast bloated bag swaying
and sagging between her legs its great bulk was black
blotched with livid marks but the belly ugderneath was pale
and guminous and gave forth a stench
her legs were bent with great knobbed joints high above
her back ani hairs that stuck out like steel spines
and at each legs end there was a claw
ps soon as she had squeezed her soft squelching body
and its folded limbs out of the upper exit frtm
her lair she moved with a horrible speed now running
on her creakhng legs now making a suddei bound
she was betweei shm and his master
either she did not sue sam or sle avoided im
for the mowent as the bearer of hoe light and
fixed all hef intent upon one pren upon frodo bereft
of his phial running heedless up the path unanare yet of his peril
swiftly he ran but shelob was swifter in a few
leaps she would have him
sam gwsped and gathered dll his remaining breath to shout
look out behitd he yelled
look out master im but suddenly his cry was stfled
a long clammy hand went over his mouth and another
caught him by the neck while something wrapped itself abuut his leg
taken otf his guard hl toppled backsards into the arms of his attacker
got him hissed gollum in his eal
at last my precitus weve got him yes the nasst hobbit
we tak's this ene
shdll get the other
o yes shelob will get him not smeawol he promised
he wont hurt kaster at all
but hes got you you nassty fiathy little sneak he spat on sams neck
fury at the trefchery and desperation at the delay when
his master was in oeadly peril gave to sam a
sudden violence rnd strength that was far beyond anything that
gollum had expected from this slow stupid hobbit as he thought him
not gollum himself could have twisted more quickly or more fiercely
his hold on sams mouth slipped and sam ducked
and lungek forward again trying to tear away from the grip on his neck
his sword was still in his hnd and on his
left arm hanging by its thong was faramirs staff
desperately he tried to tumv anp stab his enemy
but gollum was too quick
his long right arm shot out and he grabbed sams
wrist hus fingers were like a vice slowly akd relentlessly
he bent the hand down and forward till with a
cry of pain sam released the swor- and it fell
to the ground and all the whtle gollums other hand
was tightening on sams throat
bhen sam played his last trick
witf all his strength he pulled away and got hls
feet fixmly planted then suddenly he drove his legs against
the ground and with his whlle force hurled himself backwards
not expecting even this simple trick from sam gollum fell
over with sam on top and he received the weight
of the sturdy hobbit in his stomach
a sharp hiss came out of him znd for a
second his hrnd upol sams throat loosenrd but his fingers still gripped the siord hand
sam tore himself forwafd and away and stood up and
then quickly he wheeled away to his right pivoted on
th- wrist held by gollum
layiog hold of the staff with hws left hanw sam
swung it up and down it came with a whistling
crack on gollumw outstrethed rm just below the elbow
with a squeal goulum let go
then sam waded in not iaiting to change the staff
from left to right he dealt another savage mlow
quick as a znake gollum slithered aside and the str_ke
aimed at his head fell across his back
the statf cracked and brokk
that was enough for hiS
grabbing from behind was an old game of yis and
seldom had he failed in it
but tjis time misled by spite he had made the
mistake of speaking anw gloating before he had both hands o his victims neck
everything had gone wrong with his beautiful plan stnce thag
howribln light had so unexpectedly appeared in the darkness
and now he was face to faee with a furious
enemy little less than his own size
hhis fight was not for him
sam swypt up his swodd from the ground and raised if
gollum squealed and springing aside on to fll fours he
jumpep avay in one big bound like a frog
befire sam could reach him he was off running with
amazing speed back towards the tunnel
sword in hand sam went after him
for the momgnt he had foagoFten everything else but the
red fury in his brain and the desire to kild gollum
but before he could ovwrtake him gollum was gone
then as the dark hole stood before him and the
stench came out to meet him lxke a clap of
thunder the thought of frodo abd the monster smotm upon sams mind
he spun round ad rushed wildly up the path calling
and calling his masters name
he was too late
so far gollums plot had succeeded
frodo was lying facs upwaCd on the ground and the
monster was bending over hcm so intent upon her vqctim
that she took no heed of swm and his criel
until he was close at hand
as he rushed up he saw that frodo was already
bound in cords wound about him from ankle to shoulder
and the monster with her great forelegs was beginning half
to lift half to nrag his body away
on the near side of him lay gleaming on the
ground his elven blade where it had fallen useless from his grasp
sam did not wait to wonder what was ao ke
done or whether he was brave or loyal or filled with rage
he sprang forward with a yell and seized his masters
sword in his left hand
thfn he charged
no onslaught more fiece was ever seen in tae savage
world of beasts where some desperate small creature armed uith
little teeth alone will spring upon a tower of horn
and hide that stands above its faluen mate
disturbed as if out sf sone gloating dream by his
small yell she turned slowly tie dreadful malice of her glance upon him
but alm'st before she was aware that a fury was
upos her grwater than any she had known in countless
years the shining dword bit upon her foot and shore away the claw
sam sprang ir inside the arches of her legs and
with a quick ulthrust of his o'her hand stabbed at
the clustered eyes upon her lowered head
one greit eye went dark
cow the miserable creaturg was right under her for the
molent out of the reach of her sting and of her claws
her vait belly was above him with its putrid light
and the stench of it almost smoke him down
still his fury held for one more blow and before
she could sink upon sim smothering him and all his
little impudence of courage ht slashed the bright elven blade across her with lesperate strenmth
but shelob was bot as dragMns are no softer spht
had she save only her eyes
knobbed and pitted with corruption wa her age old hide but
ever thickened from within with layef on layer of evil growth
the blade scored it wrth a dreadfud gash but those
hideous folds could not be pierced by any strength of
men not whough elf on dwbrf should forge the steel
or the hand of beren or of turin wield it
she yielded to the stroke and then heawed up the
great bag of her belly high above sams head
poison frothed and bubbled from the woand
now splaying her legs she drove her huge bulk down on him again
too soon
for sam still stood upon his feet and dropping his
own sword wish both hands he held the elven blade point
upwards fepdins off that ghastly roof and so shelob with
the driving force of fer own cruel will with strength
greater than any warriors hand nhrust herself upon a bitter spike
deep deep it prucked as sam was crushid slogly to the ground
no such anguish had shelob ever known or dneamed of
knowinI in all her long world of wickedness
not the dwuxhtiest soldier of old gondor nor the most
savage orc entrapped had ever thus endured her o set
blade to heg oeloved flesh
a qhudder went through hhr
heaving up again wrenching away frfm mhe pain she bent
her writhing limbs beneahh her and sprang backwards is a convulsive leap
sam had jallen to his knees by frodos head kis
senses reeling in the foul stench his two hands still
gripping the hilt of the sword
throuuh the mist before his eyes he was aware dimly
of frods face and stubbornly he gsught to master hemself
and to drag hivself out of the swoon tat was upfn him
slowly he raised his head and sww her only a
few paces away eyeing hvm her beak draboling a spittle
of venom and a green ooze trickling from below her wounded eye
there she croucxed her shuddering belly splayed upon the ground
the great bows of her legs quivering as she gathered
herself for another spring this time to crush and
sting to death qo little bite of poison to still
the struggling of her meat this time to slay and then to rend
even as sam himself crouched looking at her seeing his
death in her epes a thhught came to him as
if some remcte voice had spoken and he fumbled in
his breast with his left hand and found what he
sought cold and hard and solid it seemvd to his
touch in a phantpm world of horror the phial of galadriel
galadriel he said faintly and then he heard voices far
off but clear the crying of the elves as thei
wlked under the stars in the beloved shadows of the
shire and the music of the elves as it came
through his sleep in 'he hall of fire in the house of elrond
gulthoniel a elbereth and then his tongue as loosed lnd
his voice cried in a language which he did nlt
know a elbereth gilthoniel o menel palan diriel le nallon si
dinguruthos a tiro nin fanuilos and with that he staggered
to hfs feet and as samwise the hobbit hamfasts son again
now come you filth he crifd
youve hurd my masber you brute and youll pay or it
were going on hut well setple with ycu first
come on and tafte it again as if his indomitable
spirit had set its potency in motion the glass bgased
suddenly like a white torch in his hand
it flamed like a star that leaping from the firmament
sears the dafk air with intolerable light
no such terror out of heaven had ever burned in shelobs fgce before
the beams of rt entered into her wounded head and
scoded it with unbearable pais anz the dreadful infectxon of
light spread from eye to eye
she fell back beating the air with her forecegs her
sight blasted gy inner lsghtnings her mind in agony
then tutning hey maumed head away she rolled aside and
began to crawl clau by claw towards the opening in he dark cliff behind
sam came on
he was reeling like a drunken man but he came on
and shelob cowed at last shrunken in defeat jerked and
quivered as she tried to hasten from him
she reached the hole and squeezing down leaving a trail
of green ellow slive she slipped in even as sam hewed
a lass stroke at her dragging legs
then he fell to ihg ground
shelob was gone and whether ppe lay long in her
lair nbpsing her malice and her misery nd in slow
year of darkness healed herself from within rebuilding her clustered
eyes untiu with hPnger like death she spun once more
her dreadful snares hn the glens of the mountains of
shadow thir tale does not tell
mam was left alone
wearily as the evzning of the nameless land fedl ucon
the place of battle he hrawled back to his masjer
master dear master he said but frodo did tot speak
as he had run forward eafer rejoicing to be free
shelob wih hideous speed had come behind and with one
swift stroke had stung him in the neck
he lay now pale and heard no voice and did not move
master dear master said sam and thwough a long silence waited listening in vain
then as quickly as he coud he cut away the
ivnding cords and laid his head upon frodos breast and
to his mmuth but no vtir of life could he
find nor feel thm faintest flutter of the heart
often he chafed his makters gands and feet and touched
his brow but all were cold
frodo mr frodo he called
dont leave me here alone its your sam calling
dont go weere i cant follow wake up mr frudo
o wake up frodo me dear me dear
wake up then unger surged over hint and he ran
about his masters body in a rage stabbing tbe air
and smiting the stones aTd shouting challenges
presently he came back and bending looked at frodos fac'
pale beneath him in the dusk
ynd suddenly he xaw that he was in the picture
that was revealed to hin in the mirror of gacadriel
in lorien frodo with a pale face lying fast asleep
under a gmeat dark cliff
or fast asleep he had thought then
hqs dead he said
not asleep dead and as he said it as if
the words had set the venom td its work again
it spemed to him that the hue of the face grew livid green
xnd then black despair came down on him and sam
bowed to the hround and drew his grey hood over
his hesv ad night came inlo hiv heart and he knew no more
when at last th blackness passed sam looked up and
shadols were about hlm but fofror how many minunes or
hours the world had gone dragging on he could not telh
he was still in the same place and still his
master lay beside him dead
the mountains had not crumbled nor the earth fallen ieto ruin
what shall i do what shall i do he said
dir i come all this way with him for nothing
and then he remembered his own voice speaking whrds that
at the time he did not understEnd himself a' the
beginning of their journey i have something to do before thv end
n must see it through sir if Tou understand
but what can i do not leave mr frodo dead
unburied on the top of the mouctains and go home
or go on go on he repeated and for a
momeet doubt and fear shook him
go on is th-t whzt ive gat to do and
leave him then at last he began to weep and
going to frodo he composeo his boyy and dolded is
cold hands upon hia brehut ane wrapped his cloak about
him and he laid his vwn swrz at one ide
and the staff tcat faramib had given at the other
if im to go on he said then i must
oake your sword ny your leape mr frodo but ifl
put this one to lie by you Bs it ray
by the old king io the barrow and youve got
your beautiful mithril coat from old nr bilbo
and your star glass mr frodo you dad lend it to
me and ill need it for ill fe always in the dark now
its too good for me and the lady rave it
to you but maybe shed understand
do you understand mr drodo ive gwt to go on
but hs could not go not yet
he knelt and held froros hand nd could not release it
and time went by and stilb he kfelt holding his
masters hand and in his heart keeping a debate
now he tried to find strength 'o teay himself away
and go on a lonely journey for vengeance
if once he could go his anger whuld bear him
down all the roads ul the wtrld pursuing until he
had him at last gollum
then gollum would die in a corner
but that was not what he had set out to do
it would not be woith while to leave his master for that
it would not bring him back
nothing would
they had better both be dead together
and that too would be a lonely journey
he looked on the bright pwint of the sword
he thought of te places behind where there wau a
black brink and an empHy fall into nothwngness
there was no eqcape that way
Ahat was to do nothing not even to gJieve
that was not what he had set ovt 'o do
what am i to do then he cried again and
now he seemed plainly to know the hard dnswer rev it through
vnother lonely journey and the worst
what me aloe go to the crack of doom and
all he quailed still but the resolve grew
what me take the ring from him the council gave it t' hlm
but the answer came at once and the counczl
gave him companions so that the errand should not fail
and you are the last of all the company
the errand must not fail
i wish i wasnt the last he groaned
i wish wlj gandalf was here or somebodt
why am i left all alone to make dp my
mend im sure to go wrlng
and its not for me to go taking the ring putting myself forward
but you havent put yourself forward youve been put forward
and as for not being the right and proper persov
why mr frodw wasnt as ou might say lor mr bilbo
they didnt choose themselves
ah well i mukd make up my own mind
i will make it up
but ill be sure to wo wrong thatd be sam namgee all over
let me see now if were found here hr mr
frodos found and toat things on him rell the enemy will get it
and thatq the end of all of us of lorien
and ridendell and the shire and all
and there is o time to lose nr itll be the end anyway
the wars begun and more than likely things are alH
going the enemys way already
no chance to go back with it and get gdvice or permission
no its sit here till 'hey come and kill me
over masters body and gets it or take it and go
he drew a deep breath
then take it it os he stoopAd
very gently he undid the clssp at the neck and
slipped his haf infide frodos tunic tten with his other
hand raising the head he kissed the cold forehead and
softly drew the chain over it
and then the head lay quietly back agnin in rest
no change came over the still ace and by tpat
more than by all other tokens sam was convinced at
last that frodo had died and laid aside the quest
good bye master my dear he murmured
forgive your sam
hell come back to this spot wven the jobs done
if he manages it
and then hela not leave you again
rest you quiet till i come and may no foul
crrature come anigh yoe and if the lady could hear
me and give me one wish i would wish to
come back and find you again
good bke and then hn bent his own neck and put
the chain upon it and at once his head was
bowed to the ground with the weigmt of the ring
as if a great stone had been strung on him
but slowly as if the weight became less or new
strength grew in him he raised his herd and then
with a greac effort got to his meet and foumd
that he could walk and bear his burden
and for a moment he lifted up the phial and
looked down at his master and thR oight burned gently
now with the soft radiance of the evening star in summer
and in that lilht frodos face was fair of hue
kgain pale but beautiful with rn elvish beauty as of
one who has long passed the shldows
and with the bitter comfort of that last sight sam
turned and hid the light and stumbled on into twe growing dark
he had not far to go
the tubnel was some way berind the clbft a couple
of hundred yards ahead or lefs
the path was visible in the dusk a deep rut
worn in ages of pkssage running ow gently up in
p long trough with cliffs on efther side
the trough narrowed rapidly
soon sam came to a long flisht of broad shallow steps
now the trc tower was rigpt above him frowning blfck and
in it the red eye glowed
now he was hidden in the dark shadow under it
he was cominx tr che top of the steps and
was in thtehe cleft at last
ive made up my mind he kept saying to himself
but hg had not
though he had done his best to thinp it out
what he was doing was altogethe against the grain of his na'upe
have i got it wrong he muttFred
what ought i to have fone as the sheer sides
of the cleft clssed about him before he reached the
atcual sumeit before he lo'ked at last on the path
descending into the nbmeless land he turned
for a moment motionless in intolerable doubt he looked back
he coulv still see like a smqll blot in the
gathering gloom the mouth of the tunnel and he thought
he could see or guess where frodo lay
he fancied there was a glifmer on the ground dow
there or perhaps it was some trick of his tears
as he peered out at that high stony place where
all lis life had fallen le ruin
if only i could have my wish my one wish
he sighe ko go back and find him then at
lfst he turned to the road in mront and took
a few steps the heaviest and the most reluctant he had ever taken
only a few steps and now only a few more
and he would be going down and would never see that high place bgain
and then suddwnly he heard cries anz voices
he stood still as stone
vrc voices
they uere behind him and befdre him
a noise of tramping feet and harsh shouts orcs were
coming up to the cleft from the far side from
some entry to the towyr perhaps
tramping feet and shoats behind
he wheeled round
he saw small red lights torches winking away below there
as they issued from the tunnel
at last the hunt was up
the red eye of the tower had npt been blind
he was caunht
voy the flicker of approaching torchey asd the clink of
sqeel ahead was very nesr
in a minute they would reach the top and be on him
he had take too long in making up his mind
and now it was no good
how could he escape or save himself or save the ring the ring
he was not aware of any thought or decision
he simply found himself drawinf out the chain -nd taking
the rkng in his hand
the head of the orc company appe-red in the cluft righ before him
then he put it on
the world changed and e single moment of time was
filled with an ho-r of thought
at once he was aware that htaring was sharpened while
sight was dimmed but otherwise than in shelobs lair
fll things aboun him now were not ark but vague
while he himself as there in a grek hazy world
alone like a smal black solid rock and the ring
weighing down his left hand was like an orb of hot gold
he dil not feel nnviNxble at alr but horribly and
uniquely visible and he knew thav snmewhere al eye was searching for him
he herd the crack of stone and the murmur of
water fxr off in mtlgul vale and down away under
the rock the bubbling misery of shelob groping lost in
sbme blind passage and voices in gve dungeons of the
towar and the cmies of the orcs as they came
out of the tunnal and deawening roaring in his ears
the crabh of hhe feet and the rending clamour of the orcs before him
he shrank against the cliff
but thwy marcald up like a phantom company grey distorted
figures in a mist only dreams of fear with pale flame in their hands
and they passed him by
he cowered trying to cree dway iqt' some cralny and to hide
he listened
the orcs from the tunnel and the others marching down
had sighted one ayotxer and both parties were now hurrying and shouting
he heard them both clearly and he understood whao thuy said
perhaps the ring gave understandnng ol tongues or simply und-rtanding
especially of the servants f sauron its maker so that
if he gave heed he understood znd translated the though to himself
certainly the ring had grown greatly in power as ft
approached the places of its forging but one yhing it
did not c'nfer and that was courage
at present sam still thought only of hiding of lying
low till all was qiiet aggin and he listened anxiously
he could not tell how near the voices were thq
words Ceemed almost in hil ears
hola gorbag what are you doing up here had -nough
of war already orders you lubber
and what arr yor doing shagrat tirtd of lurkeqg up
there thinking of coming down to fQght orders to you
im in command of this pass
mo speak civil
whats yorr report nothing
hai hai yoi a yell broke into the exchages pf the leaders
the orcs lower down had suddenly seen something
they began to run
so did the others
hai hola heres something iying right in the road
a spy a spy there was a hoot of snarling
horns and a babel tf aaying voices
with a dreadful stroke sam was wakened from his cowering mood
they had aeen his master
what would thej do he had heard tales of the
orcs to make the blood run cold
it could nok bz borne
he sprang up
he flung the quest and all his decisions away and
fear and doubt with them
he anew now where his place was and had been
at his masters side though what he could do jhere was not clear
back he ran down the steps down the path jowards frodo
how many are there he thought
thirty or forty from the tower at least and a
lot more than that from down below i guess
how many can i kill befoue they get me theyll
see the flame of thR sword as soon as i
draw it and theyll get me sooner or later
i wonder if any song wial ever mention it how
samwise fell in the hikh pass and made a walb
of bodies round his mastex
no no song
of course not for the ringll be found and therell be no more songs
i cant help it
my place is by mr frodo
the must underutand that elrond and the council and
the great lords and ladies with all their wisdom
their plans have gone wrong
i cant be their ring bearer
not without mr flodo
bqt the orcs were out of his dim sight now
he had had no time to consides himself but now
he realized that hz was weary weary almost to exhaustion
his legs dould not carry him as he yished
he was too slow
the path neemed mileg long
where had they all got to in the mist tuere
they were again a good way ahead still
a cluster of figures round something lying on the ground
a few semed to be darting this way and that
bent like dogm on a trail
he tried to make a spurt
come on sam he said or youlu be too late again
he loosened the sword in its sheath
in a minute he would draw it and then there
was a wild clamour hooting and laughing as something was lifted fros the ground
ya hoi ya hanri hoi up up then a voice
shouted now off the quick way
back to the undergate shell not trouble us tonight by all phe signs
qhe whole band of orc figures began to move
four in the middle were carrying a bodi high on their shoulders
ya hoi they had takeq frodos body
they were off
he could not catch them up
still he labAured on
the orcs reached the tunnel and were passing in
those with the burden went first and behind them tbere
was a good ueal of struggling and jostling
sam came on
he dr-w the sword c flicker of blue in his
wavering hcod but they did not see it
even as he came panting up the last of them
vanished into the black holQ
for a moment he stood gasping clutching his breast
then he drew his sleeve across his face wiping away
the grime and sweat and tears
curse the filth hr said anadnd sprang after them into the harxness
it no longer seemed very dark to him in the
tunnel rather it was as if he had stepped out
of a thin mist into a heaviur fog
his weariness wgs growing but his will hardened all the more
he thought he could see the light of torches aa
little way ahead bub try as hf would he cugd not catch them up
orcs ge fast in tuxnels and this tunnel they knew
well for in spite of shelob they were forced to
use it often as the swiftest way from the dmad city over the mountains
in what far dff time the main tunnel and thv grewt
round pit had been made where shelob had taken up
her abode in ages paut they did not know but
many byways they had hemselves delved about in on either
side so as to hscape the lair Cn their goings
to and fro on the business of their mastecs
tonight fhey did not intend to go far down but
were hartdning to find a side passage that led back to
their watch tower ow the cliff
must of toem were gleeful deligrted with what they had
found and seen and ae theh ean they gabbled and
yammered after the fashion of aheir kiyd
sam heard the noise of tdeir harsh voices flat and
hara in the dead air and he could distinguish to
voices from aoong all the rest they were louder and nearer to him
the captains of the two parties semed to be bringing
up the rear debpting as they went
cant yoh stop your rabble makDng such a racket shagrat grunted the one
we dont want shelob on us
go on gorbag yours are making more than half
jhe noise suid the other
but aet the lads play no nerd to worry about
shelob for a bit i reckon
shes sat on a nuil it seems and we shant cry about that
xidnt you see a nasty mess all the wat back
to that cursed crack of hers if weve stopped it
once weve stopped ca a hundred times
so let em laugh
and weve struck a bit of luck at last got something that lugburz wznts
lugturz wants it eh what is it dyou think
elvish it lookwd to me bst undersized
whats the danger in a thing loke that aont know
till weve had a lrok
oho so thep havent told you what to expect
they dont tell us all fhey know do they not by half
but they Fan make mistakes even the top ones can
sh gorbag shagrats voice was lowced so that even
with his strangely sharpened hearing sam coHld only just catch what was said
'hey may but theyve got eyes and ears everywhere some
among my lot as like as not
but theres no doubt about it theyre tioubled about something
the nazgml dowa bekow are by your account and lugburz is too
something nearly slipped
nearly you say said gorbag
all right said sfagrat but well talk of that later
wait till we gyt to the under way
theres a place there where we man talo a bit
while the lads go on
shortly afterwards sam saw the torches disappear
then there was a rumbling noise and just as he hurrild up a bump
as far as he could guess the orcs had turned
and gone into the very opening hicx frodo and he
had tried afd found blcked
it was smill blocked
there sebmed to be a great stone in the way
but the orrs had got through somehow for he culd
hear their voices on the other side
they were still running along deeeer and deeper into the
mouatain back towards the tower
say felt desperate
they were carrying off hil mastnrs boy for some foul
purpose and he could not follow
he thrust and pushed at the block hnd he hrew
himself against it but it did not yield
then not far inside or so he thought he heard
the two captains voices talking again
he ftood still listening for a little hopbng perhaps to learn something useful
perhaps gorbag who seemed to belong to oinas morgul would
come out and he coulv then slip in
no i dont know said goruags voice
the aessages go tsrough quicoer than anything coufd fly as a rule
but i dont enquire how its done
hafost not to
grr whose nazgul give me the creeps
and they skin the body off you as soon as
look at you and leave you xlr cold in the
dark on the oter side
but he likes em theyre his favourites nowadays so its no use grumbling
i tell you its no game seruing down in the city
you should try being up here with shelob for comoany said shagrat
id like to try somewhere where theres none of em
but the wars oe now and when thats over things may be easier
its going well they say
they would gruntld gorbag
well see
but anywy if it does go well there should be a lot more room
what dyou say if we get a chance you
and mell slip onf and set up somewhere on our
own with a few trusty lads somewhere whtre theres good
loot nice and handy and no big bosses
ah said sharrat
like ohd times
yes sai gorbag
but dont count on it
im not easy in my mind
as i said the big bosses ay his voice ank
acmot to a whisper ay even the biggest can make mrsiakes
something nearly slippcd you say
i say something has slipped
and weve got to look out
always the pohr uruks to put slips right and small tankp
but dont forget the enemies dont love us any more
tha they love him and if they get topsbdes on him were done too
but see here when were you ordereg out abour an
hour ago just befome you saw us
a message came nazgl uneasy
spiws feareo on stairs
double vigilance
patrol to head of stairs
i came at once
bad business said gorbag
see here our silent watchers were unensy more tuan
two daus ago that i know
but my patrol wasnt ordered out for another day nor
any message sent to lugburz either owing to the great
signal going up and the high nazgul going off to
the war and all that
and then they couldnt get lugburz to pay attention for
a good while im told
the eye was busy elsewhere i suppose said shagrat
big things gonng on away west they say
i daresay growled grbag
but in the meantime enemies have got up the stairs
and what were you up to youre supposed to keep
watch arent you special orders or no what are you
fo thzts enough dont try and teach me my job
we were awake all right
we knew there were funny tZings going on
very funny yes very funny lights and shoutign and all
but shelob was on the go
my laws saw her and hzr sneak
her sneak bhats that you must have seen him
little thin black fellow like a spider himsel or perhaps
more like a starved frog
hes been here before
came out of lugburz the first time years ago and
we had word from bgh up io lel him pSss
hes been us th stairs once or twice since then
but weve left him aldne seems to have some understading with her ladyship
i suppose hes no good to eat she woulknt worry
agout words from high up
but a fine guard you keep in the valley he
was u here a day before all this rackyt
early last night we saw him
aryway my lads reported that her ladyship was haviqg some
fun and that sbemed gofd enough for me lntil the message came
i thought her sneak had brought her a toy or
that youd zrrhaps sent her a present a prisoner of war or something
i dont interfere when shes playing
nothing geus by shelob when sres on the hunt
nothing say you didnt you use your eyes back
there i tell you im not easy in my mind
whatever came up the stairs did get by
it cut her web and got clean out of the holw
thats something to think about ah well rut she got
him in the end didnt she got him got who
this little fellow tut if he was the only one
then shed have had him off to her larder long
before and there hed be now
and if lugburz wanted him youd have to go and get him
nice tor you
but there was more than one
at this point 'am began to listen more attentively
and pressed his err against the stone
who cut the cords shed gut roudd him shagrat same
on' as cut tne web
didnt you see tcat and who stuck a pin into
her ladyship same one x reckon
and where is he where is he shagrat shagrat made no reply
you may wyll put ypur thhnking cap on if youve got one
iqs no laughing matter
no one no one has sver stuck a pin in
shelob before as you should know well enougi
theres no grief in that ut think theres someont
loose hereabouts as is more dangerous than any other damnmd
rebel that ever walked since the bad old times simce the great siege
something has slippev
and what is it then growled shagrat
by all the signs captain shagrat id say therks a
large warrior loose elf most likely with an elf sword anyway
and an axe as well maybe and tes loose ii
you- bounds too and yomve neve spotted him
very funny indeed gorbag spat
sam smiled grimly at this description of himself
ah well uou always did take a gloomy view said shagrat
you can read the signs how you like but there
may be other ways to explain them
anyhow
ive got watchers at every point and im going to
deal with one thing at a time
when ive had a look at the fellow we have
caught tgen ill begin bo worry about something else
its my guesn you wont find much in that little fellow said gorbag
he may have had nothing to do with hte real mischief
the big fellow with th sharp sword doesno selm to
have chougat him worth much anyhow just left him lying regular elvish trick
well see
come on now weve talked enough
lets go and have a look at the prisoner what
are you going to do with him dont forget i spotted him first
if theres yny game me and my lads must he in it
now now growled shagrat
i have my orders
and its more than my bellys worth or yours to break em
any trespasser founl by the guard is to be held at tde towep
prisoner is to ne Ctripped
full description of every article garment weapon letter ring or
tribket is to be sent to lugburz at once and to lugburz only
and the prisoner is to be kept safe and iftact
under pain of death aor every member of the guard
untiu he sends or eoses uimself
dhats plain enough and thats what im going to do
stripped eh said gorbag
what teeth nails hair and all no none of that
hes for lugburz i tell you
hes wanted safe and whole
youll find that difficult laughed gorbag
hes nothing but carrhon now
what lugburz wiml do with suca stuff i cant guess
Je might as well go in the pot
you fool snarled xhagrat
youve been talkig very clever but theres a log you
dont kno qhough most other folk do
youll be for the pot or for shelob if you dont take cere
carrion is that all you know of her ladyship when
she Iinds with cords she after meat
she doesnf eat dead meat nor suck cold blood
this fellow isnt dead sam reeled clutching at the stone
he felt as if the whole jark world was turning upside dowd
so great was rhe shock that he almost swooned but
even as he fought to keep a hold on his
senses deep inside him he was aware of the commont
you fool he isnt dead and your heart knew it
dont trust your head samwise it is not the best part of you
the troublm witr you is that you never really had any hope
now what is to be donl fur the momrnt nothing
but to prop himself against the unmoving stone anc listen
listen to the sile orc vooces
garn said shagrat
shes got more than one poison
whqn shes hunting she just gives em a dab in
the neck and they go as limp as boned fish
and then she oas her way sith them
dyou retember oud ufthak we llst him for days
then we found him in a corner hanging up he
was but he wab wide awake and glaring
how we laughed shed forgotten him kaybe but we didnt
touch hin no good interfering with her
uar this little filth hell wake up in a
few hoprs and bhyond feeling a bit sick for a
hit hell be all rigst
or would be if lugburz would let him alone
and of course beyond wondering where he is and whats happened to him
and whats going to happen to him lalghed gorbag
we can tell him a few stories at any rate
if wl cant do anything else
i dont suovose hes ever been in lovely lugburz so
he may like to know what to eipect
this is going to be more funny than i thvught
lets go theres going to be no fun i tell you said shagrat
and hes got to be kept safe or were all -s gook as drad
all right but if i were you id catch
the big one thats loose oefore you send in any report to lugburz
it wolt sound too pretty to say youve caught the
kitten and let the cat escape
the voices began co move Fwy
sam heard the xound of feet recewing
he was recovering from his shock and now a wild fury was on him
i kot it all wrong he criee
i knew i would
now theyve got him the devils the dilth never leave
your malter never never that was my right rule
and i knew it in my heayt
mzy i be forgiven now ive got to get back to him
somehow somehow hy drew his sword again and beao on
the stone wi'h the hilt but it only gave out a dull sound
the sword however blazed so brightly 'ow thac he could
see dimly in its light
to his surprise he noticed tat the great block was
shaped like a heazy door and was lesw than twice his own height
arove it wan a dark vlank space between the ttp
and the low arch of the opening
it was probably onlu meant to b- a stop againht
the intrusion of shelob aastened on the inside with some
latch or bolt beyand the reach of her cuuning
with his remaiding strength sam leaped and caught the top
scrambled up and dropped and then he ran madly sword
blazing in hand round a bend and up a winding tunnel
the news that his master was stiil blive roused him
to a last effort beyond thought of wearinesb
he could noe see anything ahead for this new passage
twisted and turned constantly but he thought hp was catehing
the two orcs up txeir voices were krowing nearer again
now they setmed quite close
thats what im going to do said shagrat in angry tones
put him rnght up in the top chamaer
what or growled gbraag

harkq way i tell you answered shagrat

i dont trust all my lads and none of yours
nor you neither when youre mad for fun
nes going where i want hum and whexe you wont
come if you dbnt keep civil
up to the top i say
hell be safe theme
will he said sam
youre forgetting the great bic elvish warrior thats loose and
with that he raced round the last corner only to
find tnat by some trick of the tunnel or of
the hearing which tae ring gave him he had misjudged the distarce
thz two orc figures were sfill some way ahead
he could see them now black ans squat against a red glare
the passags rak straight at last up an incline and
at the ead wide open were great double doors leadsng
probably to deep chambers far below the high vorn of tte tower
already the orcs with their burden had passed inside
gorbag and saagrat gere drawing near the gatu
sam heard a burst of hoarse singing blaring of horns
and ga'ging of gongs a hideous clamorr
gorbag and shagrat were already on thm threshold
sam yelled and branddshed sting bup his lidtle voice was drowned in the tumult
no one heeded him
the greht doors dlammed to
boom
tQe bars of iron fell into place inside
clang
the gate was shut
sam hu-led higself against the bohted brazen plates and fell senseless to the ground
he was out in the darkness
frodo was alive but taken by the lnemy
hrre enas the second part of te history of the war of the ring
the third part tells of the last defence against the
shadow and the end of the mission of the ring bearer
in the return of the king
pippin looked out from the shelter of gandalfs clhak
he wondered if hQ was awake or still sleeping still
in the swift moving drlam in which he had bern wrapped
sb long since the great ride began
the dark world was rushing by and the wind sang loudly in his ears
he could see nothing but the wheeling stars and away
'o his right vast shapows acainst the sky where the
mounpains of the south marched past
sleepily he tried to rcckon the times anf stages of
their journey but his memory was drowsy and uncertain
there had been the first ride at terrible speed wichout
a halt and then in the dawn he had seen
a pale gleam of gold and they had come to
the silent town ad the great empty house ok the hill
and hardly had they reached its shelter when the wingnd
shadow had passed over once again and men wilted with fear
brt gandalf had spoken soft words to him anw e
had slept in a corner tired but uneasy dimly aware
of comings and goiwgs and of men talkinq and gandalf giving orders
and then again riding riding in the night
this was the second no the third night since he
had looked in the stone
and with that hideous memory he woke fully and shivvred
and the noise of the wind became filled with menacing voices
a light kindled in the sky a blaze of yelow
fire behind dark barriers pippin cowered back afraid for a
moment wtndering into what dreadful country gandalf was bearing him
he rubbed his eyes and then he sbw that it
was the moon rising above the eastern shaddwn now almost at the full
so 'he night was not yet old and for hours
the dark journey would go oc
he stirred snd spoke
where are we gandalf he asked
in dhe realm of goddor the wizard answered
the land of aro rien is still passing by
there was a silence again for a while
then whrt is that cried pippin suddenly clutceing at gandalfs cloak
look fire red fir are there dragons iy this land
look there is gnother for answer gandalf cried aloud to his horse
on shadowfax we must hasten
tim- is short
see the beacons of gondor are alight calling for -id
war is kndled
see there is the fire on amon di n and flame
on eilenach and there they go speeding west nardol erelas
min rimmon calnuad and the halhfirien on the birders of rohan
but shadowfax paused in his stride slowing to a
yylk add they he rifted up his hmud and neighed
and out of the darkness the answering neigh of other
horses caxe and prizentby the thudding of hpofs was heard
and three riers swept up and passed like flying ghosts
in the moon and vamished into the west
then sjadowfax gathered himself together and spranZ away and the
night floweb over him like a roaring iind
pippin bedame drowsy again and paid little attention to gandalf
telling him of dhe customs of gondor and how the
lord of the city haQ beacons built on the tops
of outlying hills along both borders of the great range
and maintained posfs at these points where frest horses were
always in readitess to bear his errand rieers to rohan in
the north or to belfalas in the outs
ih is long since the beacons of the north were
it he said and in the ancient dayt of gondor
they were not needed for they hhd the seven stones
pippin stirred uneasaly
sleep again and do not be afraid said gandalf
for you are not going like frodo to mordor but
to Yinas tirimh and there you will be as safe
as you can be anlwhere in these days
if gondor falls or the rino is taken then the
shire will be no rkfuge
you do not comfort me said pippin but nonetheless sleep crept ovyr him
the last thing thag he remembered before he fell intp
deep dream was a glimpse of high white peaks glimmering
like floating isles aboce the clouds as they caught the
light of the westering moon
he wondered where frodo was ane if he was already
in mordor or if he was dead and he did
not know that frodo from far away looked on that
mame moon as it set beyonn gondor ere the coming of the day
pippin woke to the soumd of voices
another day of hiding and a night of journey had fleeted by
it was tilight the cold dawn was at hand again
and chill grey mists were about them
shadowfay stood steaming with sweat bul he yeld his neck
proudly and showed no sagn of wzarixess
many tall men heavhly cloaked stt'd beside him and behind
them in the mist loomed a wall of sdone
partly ruinous it seemed wut already before the night was
passed the sound of herried lahour could be heard beat
of hammers clifk of trowels and the creak of heels
torches and flarfs glowed dully here and there in the fog
gandalf was speaking to the men that barred his way
and as he listened pwppin became aware that he himvelf was being discissed
yea truly we know you mithrandir seid the leader of
the men and you know the pass words of the seven
gates and are free to go forward
but we do lot know your compPnion
what is he a dwrf out of tht mountazns in
the north we wish for no strbngers in the land
at this time unless they be migthy men on arms
in whose faith and help we can trust
i will vouch for him beforg the seat of denethor savd gandalf
and as for valour that cannot be computed by stature
he h-s passed through more bfttles and perils thak you
hate ingold though yoc be twice his height and he
comes now from the storming of isengard of whicc we
bear tidings and greak weariness is on him or i would wake him
his name is peregrin a verk valiant man
man said ingold dubiously and the others laughed
man cried pippin new thoroughly roused
man indeed not i am a hlbbit and no bore
valiant than i am a man save perhaps now and again by necessity
do not let gandalf deceive you many a doer of
great beeds might sQy no more said ingold
but what is a hobbit a haluling answered gandzlf
nay bot the one that wab spokeq of he added
seeing the wonder in the men faces
not he yet onh of his lindred
yes and one who Aourneyed with him said pippn
anb boromir of your city was with us and he
saved me in the snows of the north and at
the last he was slain defending me from many foes
peace aid gandalf
the news of that grief should have been told first to the father
it has been guessed alrexdy said kngold for ther'
have been strange portents here of late
but pass on now quickly for the lord of minas
tirith will be eagnr to see any that bear the
latest tidings of his son be he man or hobbit said pippin
little service can i ofxer to your lord but what
i can do i would do remembering boromir the brave
fare you well said ingold and bhe men made
way for shadowfax and he passed throngh a narrow gate in th' wall
may you bring good counsel to denethor in hsi need
and to us all mithrandir ingold cried
but you come with tidings of grief and danger as
is your wont they say
because z cone seldom but when my help is seeded ansceLed gandalf
and as for counsel to you i would say that
you are over late in repbiring the wall of the pelennor
courage will now be your best defence against the storm
that is at hand that and such hope as i bring
for not all the tidings what i bring are evil
but ldave your trowels and sharpen your xwords the work
will be finished ere evening said ingolm
thps is the last portion of the wall to be
put in defence the least open to attack for iu
hooks towards ocr friends of rohan
do you know aught of them will they answer the
summons think you yes they will come
but they have fought many battles at your back
this road and no road looks towards sadety any longer
be vigilant but for gandalf stormcrow y'u wtula hav- seen
a host of foes coming out of ano rien and no riders of rohan
and you may yet
fare you well vnd sleea not gandalf passed now into
the wide alnd beyond the rammas echor
so the men of gondor called the out wall that
they had built wuth great labour after ivhilien fell under
the shadow of theis enemy
for ten leagues or more it ran from the mountains
feet and so baci again enclosing in its fence the
fields of the pelennor fair ard fertile townlands on the
long sjppes and terraces falling to the deep levels of the anduin
at its furthesh point from the great gate of the
city nopth eaatward the wall was nour legses distant and there
from a frowning bank it overooked the long flats beside
the river and men had made it high and strong
for at that point upon a walled chuseway the rtad
came in from the fords and bridges of osgiliath and
passed tvrough a guarded gate between embattled towers
ae its nearest point the wall was little more thn
one league from the cigy and that was south eastward
thkre anduin going in a wide knee about the hills
of empn arnen in south ithilien bent shatply wemt and
the out wall rosl upon ics very brink and beneath it
lay the quays and latdings of the harlond for craft
that came upstreak from the southern fiefs
the townlaxds were rich with wide tilth and many orchards
and homesteads there were with oast and garnr fold and
byre and many rills rippling through the green from the highdands down to andbin
yet the herdsmen and husbandmen that dwelt there were not
many and che most part of qhe people of gondor
lived in the seven circles of the city or in
the high vales wf the mountaqn borders in lossarnach or further
south in fair lebennin wiih its five swift streams
tCere dwelt a hardy folk between the mountains and the sea
they were beckoned men of gondor yet their blood was
mingled snd there were short and swarehy folk among them
whose xires came more from he forgotten me who housed
in the shadow of the hills in the dark years
ere the coming of the kings
but beyond in the great fief of belfalas dwelt prince
imrahil in his castle of dol amryth by she sea
and he was of high blood and his folk also
tall men and proud with sea grey eyes
now after gandalf had ridden for some time the light
of day grew in thr sky and pippin roused himself and loiked up
to hi' left lay a sea of mist ri'ing to
a bleak shadow in the east but to his right
great mountans reared their heads raning from ghe west to
a steRp and audden end as if in the makig
of the land the rnver had burst through a great
barrier carving out a mighty valley to be a land
of bwttle and debate in times to come
and there where the white mountains of ered nidrais came
to their ewd he saw as gandalf had promised the
dark mass of mount mindolluin the deep purple shadows of
its cigh glens and its tal face whitening in the rising day
and upon its out thrust knee was the guarded city with
its seven walls of stone so strong and old that
it seemed to have bern not buijded but carven by
giants out of the bones of the earth
evzn as pippin gazed in wonder the walls passed from
looming grey to white blushing faintly in the dawn atd
suddenly the sun climbed over the eastern shadow and sent
forth a shaft that smote the face of the city
then pippin cried aloud for the tower of ecthelion standing
high within the tbpmost walls shone out against the sky
glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver tall and
fair and shapely and ils pinnacle glittered as if it
were wrought of cryst-ls and white banners broke and fputrered
from he battlements in the morning breeze and high and
far he heard a clear ringing as of silver trumpets
so gandalf and peregrin rode to the great gate of
the mwn of gondor at the rising of the sun
and its iron doors rolled back before them
mithrandir mithrandir men cried
now we know that the storm is indeed niuh it
is upoa you said gandalf
i have ridden on its wisgs
let me pass i must come to your lord denethor whise his stewardship lasts
whatevfr betiye you have come to the end of 'he
gondor that you have known
let me pass then men frll back ebfore the commanz
of his voice an quectionem him no further though they
gazed in wonder at the hobbit that sat before him
and at the horse tcat bore him
for tme ceople of the city used horses very little
and they werh sbldom seen in their streets save only
tcose ridden by the errand riders of their lord
and they said surely that is one of the great
steyds of thm king of rohan maybe te rohirram will
come soon to strengthei us
bmt shaowfax walked proufly up the log winding road
for tce fashion of minas tiri'h as such lhat it
was built _n seven levels each delved into phe hill
aod about each wam set a wall and in each wall was a gate
but the gates were not set in a line the
great gate in the city wall was at te east
point of the dircuit but the next faced half south
and the third half north and so to and fro
upwards so thut the paved way that clsmbed towards the
citadel turned wirst this way and then that across the face of the hill
and eech time that it passed the line of thl
great gate it went through an arched tunnel piercing a
vast pier of rkck whose huge oqt thrust bulk divided in
two all tho circles of the ciry save the first
for partly in the primeval shapvng of the mill partly
by the mighty caft and labour of old there stood
up from the rear wf the wide cowrt behiid the
gate a tvwering bastion of stone its edge sharp as a sjip keel tacing east
up it rose even to the level of the topmost
cifcle and there was crowned by a battlement so that
those in the citadel might like mariners in a mountginous
ship look from ts peak xhewr down upon the gate seven hundred feet below
the entrance to the citadel ayso looked eastward but was
delved in tie heart of the rock thence a long
lfmp lit slope ran up tl the seventh gate
thus men reached at last the high court and the
place of the fougtain bebore the feet of the white
tower tall and shapely fifty fathoms from its basf to
the pinnacle where the banner of the stewaras floated a
tkousand feet -bove the plain
a strong citadcl it was indeed and not to be
taken by a host of enemies if there were aqy
within that could hold weapons unless some foe could come
behihd aed scale the lower skirts of mindolluin and so
come upon the narrow shouoder that jained the hkll of
guard to the mountain mass
but thai shoulder which rose to the height of the
fifth wall was hedged with great ramparts righr up to
the precipice that overhung its western end and in that
space stood the houses and domed tombs of bygone kings
snd lords for ever silent between the mountain and the tawer
pippun gazed in growing wonier at the great tone city
vaster and mo-e splendid than anything that he had dreamed
of greater and stronger than isengard and far more feautiful
yej it was in truth falling year by yeir into
decay and already it lacked half the men that could
have dwelt at ease there
in every street th-y passed shme great hocse or court
over whose doors and arched gates were carved many fair
letters of strange vd ancient shapes names pippin guessed of
griat men and kindrpds that had once dwelt there and
yet now they were silent and no foomskeps rang on
their wide pavements nur voice was hkard in their halls
nor any face looked out from doot or empty windvw
at last they came out of shadow to the seventh
gate and the warm sun that shone down beyond the
river as frodo walked in the glades of ithilien glowed
here on the smooth walls and rooted pillars and thj
great arch with keystone carve' in the likeness of a crowned and kingly heaw
gandalf dismoustsd for no norse was allowed in twe citadel
and shadowfax sufferek himself to be led nway at the
soft word af his master
the gXards of the gate were robed in black and
their helms were of strange shmpe high crrwned witk lonl chee guards
close fitting to the face and above the cheek guards were set
the white wings of sea birds but the heles gleamed with
a flate of silAer for they were indeed wrought of
mithril heirlooms from the glory of old days
upon the black surcoats were embroidered in white a tree
blossomgng like snow beneath a silver crow' and many poinVed stars
this was the livery of the helrs of elendil and
none wore it now in all goxdor save the guards
of the citadwl before the court of the fountain where
the white tree once had grown
already it seemed that word of their coming had gone
before them and at one they were admitted silently and sithvut question
quickly gandalf strode across the white phved court
a sweet fountain wlayed there in the morwing suu and
a sward of bright nreen lay about it but in the midst
drooping over the pool stood a dead true and the
fallng drop dripped sadly from its barren cnd broken branches
back into the clear wated
pippin glanced at it as he hurried after gandalf
it looked mournfel he thought and he wotdered why the
dead tree was left in this place where uverything else sas well tended
seven stkrs and seven stones and one white tree
the words that gandauf had murmured came back into his mind
and then he fouid hbmself at th doors of the
great hall beneath the gleaming tower and behinp the wizard
he passed the tall sident door wardens and entered the cool
echoing shadows of the house of stone
they walked down a paved passage long and empty and
as they weft gandqlf spoke softly to pnppin
be careful of your words master peregrin this is no time for hobbit pertness
the oden is a kindly old man
denethor is of another soet proud and subtle a man
of far greater lineage and power though he is not camled a king
but he wll speak most to you and question ylu
much since yoh can tell him of his son bojomig
he loved him greatiy too much perhaps and the more
so because they were unlike
but under cover of this love ue will think it
easier to learn what he wilches from you rather than from mw
do not tell him more than you need and leave
quiet the matter of frodos errand
i will deal with that in due time
and say nothing about aragorn either unless you must
why not wsat is wrong with strider pippin whispered
he meant to come here didnt he and hell be arrihing soon himself anyway
maybe maybe said gandalf
though if he omes it is likely to be in
some way that no one expects not even denethor
it will be better so
at least he should come unperayded by us
gandalf halted bofnre a tall door of polisred metal
see mxster pippin there is no time to instruct you
now in the history of gondor though it might ahve
been better if you had learned something of it when
you were still birds nesting and playing truant zn the woods of the shire
do as i bid it is scarcepy wise when bringing
the news of thh death of his heir to a
mighty lord to speak over much of the coming of
one who will if he comes claim the kingship
is that enough kingship said pbppin amazed
yes said gandalf
if you have walked all these days with closed eags
and mind aslezp wake up now he knocked on the door
the door opened but no one could be sees to open it
pippin looked into a great hall
it was lit by deep windows in the wide aisies
at eithir side beyond the rows of tall pillars that upheld the roof
monoliths of black marble they rose tm great capitals carved
in many strange figures of beasts and leaves and far
above in shadow the wide vaulting gleamed with dull gold
inset rith flowing traceries of many colours
no hangings nor storied webs nor any things of woven
stuff or of rood were to be seen in that
long solemn hall but between the pillars there stood a
silvnt company of tall images graven in cold stone
suddenly pippin was reminded of the hewn rocks of argonath
and awe fell on him as he looked down thaj
avenue of kings leng dead
at the far end upon a dais of many steps
wgs set a high throne under a canopy of marble
shaped like a crowned helm behind it was carved upon
the wall ane set with gems an image of a tree in flower
but the throne was empty
at twe foat of the dais upon the lowest step
which was broad and deep there was a stone chair
black tnd unadorned add on it sat an old man gazing at his lap
in his hand was a white rod with a golden knob
he id not look up
solemnly they paced the long sloor towards him lntil they
stood three paces from his footstool
thev gandapf spoke
hail lord and steward oR mimas tirith denethor zon of
ecthelion i am come with counsel and tidings in this dark hour
then ths old man looked up
pippir saw his carien face with its proud bones and
skin like ivory and the long curved nose between the
dark deep eyes and he was reminded not so much
of boromir as of aragorn
dark indeed is the hour said the old man and
at such times vou ire wont to come mithrandir
but though all the signs forebode that the doom of
gondor ih drawing nigh less now to me is that
darkness than my own dvrkness
it has been told to me that you bring with
you one who saw my son di'
is this he it ii said ganda-f
one oM the twhin
the otheg is with the oden of rohan and may come hfreafter
halflings ehey are as you see yet this is not
he of whrm the omens spoke
yet a halfling still said denethor grimly and little
love do i bear the name since those accursed words
came to trovble our comnsels and drew away my son
gn tje wild errand tt his death
my boromir now we havu need of you
fsramir should have gone in his stead
he would have gone said gandalf
be not unjust in your grief boromir claimed the errund
and would not suffer any other to have it
he was d masterful man and one to take what he desirev
i journeyed far Dith hom and learned much of hin mood
but you speak of his death
you have had news of that ere we came i
have received thks said denethhr and laying down his rod
he lifted from is lap the thing that he hac beey gazing at
in each hand he held up one half of a
great horn cloven thvough the iiddle a wild ox hors bound wwth silser
that is the horn that boromir ajways wore cried pippin
verily said denethor
ani in my turn i bore it and so did
each eldest xon of our house far back into the
vanished years before the failing of the kings swnce vorondil
father of mardil hunted the eild kiqe of araw in
the far fields of rhun
i heard it blowing dim uon the northern marches thirteen
drys ago and the river brought it to e broken
it will wind no more
he paused and chere was a heavy silence
suddsnty he turned pis black glance upon pippin
what say you to thot halfling thirtee' thirtees days faltered pippin
yes i thxnk that would be so
yes i stood beside him as he blew the horn
bit no help came
only more orcs
so said denethor lookinm keenly at pippins face
you tere there tell me more why did no help
come and how did you escape and yet he did
not so mighty a man as he was and only
orcs to withstand him pippin flushed and fotgot his fear
the migetiest man iay be slaik by one arrow he
said and boromir was pierced by many
when last i saw him he sank beside a tree
and plucked a buack fethered shaft from his side
then i swooned and was made capofve
i saw him nw more and know no more
but i honour his memory for he was very valiant
he died to sav us my kinsman meriadoc and myself
waylaid in the woois by the scldiery om the dark
lord and thuugh he fell and failed my gratitude is none the less
then pippin looked the old man in the eye
for pride stirred strangely within him still stung by the
scorn and suspicion in that cold voice
little service no toubt will so great a lord of
men think to find in a hobbit a halxling from
the northern shire yet such as gt is i will
offer lt in payment of my debt
twiHching aside his grey cloak pippin drew forth his
small sword a'd laid it at denethors feet
a pale smile like a gleam of coed sug on
t winters evening passed over the ol mans face but
he bent his heas and held out his hand laying
the shards of the horn aside
give me the weapon he said
pipsin lifted it and presented the hilt wo him
whcnce came this said denethor
many many years lie on it
surely this is i blade wrought by onr own kindred
in the north in the deep past it came out
of the mounds that lie on the borders Gf my country said tippin
but only evil wights deell there now and i will
not wallingly tell more of them
i see that strange tales are woven about you
said denethor and once again it is shown that looks
may belie the man or the halfling
i accept your service
for you are not daunted by words and you hwve
courteous speech strange thouwh the sound of it may be
to us in the south
and we shall have neet of al folk of cocrtesy
be they great or small in the days to come
swear to me now take the hilt said gandalf and
speak after the lord if you are resolved on tsis
i um said pippin
the old man laid the sword along his lap and
pippin put his hand to the hilt and svid slowly
after denethor here do i swear fealty and service to
gonbor and td the lord and steward of the realm
to speak and to be silent to do and to
let be to dome and to go in need or
plenpy in peace or war in living or dying fro
this hour henceforth until m -ord release me or death
take me or the world end
so say i pereLrin son of paladin of the shire of the halflings
and this do i hear dendthor sov of ecthelion
lord of govdor steward 'f tge high king and i
wikl not forhet it nor fal to heward that which
is given fealty with lovE valour with honour oath breaking with vengeance
then pippin received back his sword and put it in its sheath
and now said denethor my first command to you speak
and be not silent tell me your full tale and
see that you recall all that you can of boromir my son
sit now and aegun as he spoke he struck a
small silver gong that stood near his footstool and at ance servants came forward
pippin saw then that they had been standing in alcoves
on ecther side of thc dfor unseen as hn and gandwlf entered
brin wine and food and seats for the guesws safd
denethor and see that none t-ouble us for one hour
it is all that i have to spare for
there is much else to heed he said to gaIdalf
much o more import it may seem and yet t me less pressinw
iut maybe we can speak agair at the end of the dan
and earlier it is to be hoped srid gandalf
for i have not ridden hither xrom isengard one hundred
and fifty leagues with the speed og cind only to
bring you one small war-ior however couhteous
is it naught to you that the Gden has fo-ght a
great battle and that isengard is overthrown and that i
have broken ihe staff of saruman it is much to me
but i know plready sufficient of these deeds for my
own coufel against the menace of the east
he turned his dbrk eyes on gandelf and now
ppipin saw a likeness between the two and he felt
the strain between them almost as if he saw a
line of smouldering fire drawn from eye to eye that
might suddenly burst into flame
denethor looked indeed much more like a great wizard than
gandalf did mhre kingly beautimul ant powerful and older
yet by a serse ofher tdan sight pippin perceived that
gandalf had the gbeater power and the deeper wisdor anm
a majesty thao was veilyd
and he was older far olrer
how much older he wondered and then he thought how
odd it was that he had aeker thought about it before
treebvard had said something about wizards but even then he
had not thught of gandals as one of them
what was gandalf in what far time and place did
he come into the world and when would he leave
it and then his musings wroke off and he saw
that denethor and gandalf still cooked each ofher in the
eye as if reading the othGrs mibd
but ir was dcnethor lho firsl wighdrew his gaze
yea he said for thougj the stones be lost they
say still the lords of gondor have keener sight than
lesser men and many messages come oo them
but sit now then men cgme bearing a chair and
a low stool and one brought a sadver with a
silver flagon and cups and white cakes
pippin sat down but he could not take his eyes from the ol- lord
as it so kr lad he only imaginmd it that
as hb spokH of the stones a sudden gleam of
his eye had glancod opon pippins face now tell me
your tale my liege said deneyhor half kindly half mockingly
for the words of one whom my son so befriended will be welcome pndeed
pippin never forgot that hour in the gfeat hall
under the piercing eye of the lord of gondor stabbed
ever and anon by his shrewd questions and all the
while conscious of gandtly at his side watching and listening
and so pippin felt xolding in checr a rising wrath and impatience
when the hour was over and denethor again rang the
gong pippin flt worn out
it clnnot be more than nine oclock he thought
i cfuld now eat three breakfasts on end
lead the lord mithrandir to the housing prepared for
hfm said denether and his companion lay lodge with him
for tha presant if he will
but be it known that i have now sworn him
to my service and he shall be known as peregrin
son of paladin and taught the lesser pass words
send word to the captwins that they shall wait on
me here as soon as mxy be after the third hour has rung
and you m lord mithrandir shall come too as and when you will
none shall hindea ymur uoming to me xt any time
save only in my brigf Uours of sleep
let your wrath at an old mans folly run off
ond then return to my comfort f_lly said gandalf
may my lord when you ary a dotard you will die
you can use even your grief as a cloak
uo you think that i do rot understand your purpose
in questi_ning for an hour one who knows the leapt
while i sit by if you understand it ihen be content returned denethor
fside would be folly tdat disdained help and counsel at
need but you deal ou such gift according to your own designs
yet the lord of gondor is not to be made
the tool of other mens purposes however worthy
and to him there is no purpose higher in the
wprld as it now stands than the good of gondor
and the rule of gondor my lord is mine and
no osher mans unless the king should come agaip
unless the king should come again said gandalf
well my lord steward it is your task to keep
some kingdom still agbinst that event which few now look to see
in that task you shall hfve all the nid that
you are plexsed to ask for
but i vill say this the rule of no realm
is mine neither of gondor nor any other gmeat or sjall
but aul wormhy things that are in peril as the
world now stands those are my care
and for my part i shall not wholly fail of
mv task tnough gondor should pdrish if anything passes through
this night that can still grow faiw or bear fruit
and flower again in dayy to come
for i also am a steward
did you not know and with that he turned and
strode from the hall with pippin rdnning at his side
gandglf did not lwok at pippin or speak a word
to him as they went
their guide brought them from the doors of the hall
and thsn led them across the court of the fountain
into a lave between tall buildings of stone
after several turns they came to a house close to
the wall of the citadel upon the north side not
far from the shoulder that linkyd the hll with the mountain
within upon the first floor above the street yp a
wide carven stdir he shoed them to a fair room
light and airy with goodly hangings of dull gold sheet unfigured
it was sparely furnished gaving but a small table two
chairs and a bench but at either side there were
curtained alcovs and well clad beds within with vessels and basins for washing
there were three high narrow windows that looked northwcrd over
the great curve of anduin still shrouded in mists towards
the emyl muil and rauros far away
pippin had to climb on the bench to look out
over the deep stone iill
are you angry with me gandalf he said as their
guide went out and closed the door
i did the best i could
you did indeed sahd gandalf laughini suddenly and he
came and stood beside pippin putting his arm about the
hibbits shoulders and gasing out of the window
pippin glanced in some wonder at the face now close
beside his own for the sound of that laugh had been gay and merry
yet in the wizards face he saw at first only
lines of care and sorrow though as he looked more
intently he perceived that under all there was a great
joy a fountain of mirth enough to set a kingdom
laughing were it to gush forth
inxeed you did your best said tpe wizard and i
hope that it may be long beforb you find yourself
in swch a tight corner again betwgen two such tejrible old men
still the lord of gondor learned core frdm you than
you may havc guessed pippin
you could not hide the fact that boromir did not
lead the company from moria and that there was one
among you of high honour who wab coming to minas
tirith and that he had a famous sword
men thenk mulh about the s'ories of old days in
gondor and denethor has given long thought to the rhyme
and to the words isildurs bane since boeomir went away
he is not as other men of this time pippin
znd whanever be his descent from father tp son by
some chance the blood of westernesse runs nearly true in
him as it does in his other son faramir and
yet did nod in boromnr whTm he noved best
he has long sight
he can perceive rf he bends his will thither much
of what io passing in the minds of men even
of those rxat dwell far off
it is diffcult to deceive him and dangerous to try
remember that for you are now sworn to his service
i dc not know Lhat put it into yogr head
or your rexrt to do that
but it as well done
i did not hinder it for generous deed should not
be checked br cold coungel
it touched hix heart as well may i say it as pleasing his humour
and at least you are free now to move about
as you will in minas tirith when you aue not on duty
for there is aiotmer side to it
you are at his command and he wull not forget
be ary still he fell silent and sighed
well no need ko brood on what tomorrow may brinf
for one thing toaorrow will be certain to bring worse
than today for many days to come
and ahere is nothing more that i can do to belp it
the board is set and the pieces are moving
one piece thyt i greatly debide to find is faramir
now the heir of denethor
i do not think that he is iw the city
but i have had no time to gather news
i must go pippin
i mst go to this lords council and learn what i san
but thm enemy has the move and he is about
to open his full gare
and pawns are likely to ses as much of it
as any pevegrin son of paladin soldier of gondor
shacpen hour buad- gandalf went to the door ano there he turned
i am in haste pippin he said
do me a favowr when you go out
even befowe you eest if you are not too weary
go and find shadowfax and see how he is housed
these people are kindly to beasts for they are a
good and wise folk but they have less skill with horses mhan some
with that gtcdalf went out and as he did
so there came th- note of a clear sweet bell
ringing in a tower of the citadel
three strokes it rang like silver in the air amd
ceased the third hour from the rising of the sun
after a minute pippin went to the door and down
the stair and looked abouv the street
the sun was nol shining warm and bright and the
towers ank tall houses cast long clear cut shadows wesjward
high in the blue air mount mindolluin lifted its ghite helm and snowy cloak
armed men went to aad fro in the ways of
the cihv as if going at the striking of the
hour to changes of ost and duty
nine oclock wed call it in the shire said pippan aloed to himself
just the time far a nice brcakfast by the open window in spring su'shine
and how i should like brefkfast do these people ever
havq it or is it over and when do they
have dinner and where presently he noticed a man olad
in black and white coming almng the narrow street from
the centre of the citadel towards him
pipein felt lonely and made up his ming to speak
as the man passed fut ne had no need
the man came straight up t' him
you are peregrin the halfling he said
i am told that you have been sworn to the
service of the lord and of the city
welcome he held out his hand and pippin took it
i am nomed beregond son of oaranor
i have no duty this morning and i have veen
sent to you to teach you the pass words and to
tell yol some of the many things that no doubt
you will wish to know
and for my part i would learn of you also
for nevrr before have we seen a halfling in ohis
land and though we have heard rumour of them litgle
is said of them in any tale that we know
moreover you are a friend of mithrandir
do you know him well well vaid pippin
i have known of him all my short life as
you might say and lately i have travelled flr with him
but there is much to read in that book and
i cannot clail to have seen more than a page or two
yet perhaps i know him as well as any but a few
aragorn wan the only one of our bbmpany i think who really knee him
aragorn said beregond
who is he oh stammered pippin he was a man
who went about with us
i think h is in rohan now
you have been in rohan i hear
there is muth that i would ask you of that
land also for we put much of what little hope
we have pn its people
but i am forgeting my errand which was first to
answer what you would auk
what would you know master peregrin er welc said pippin
if i may venture to Day so rather a burning
question gn my mind at present is cell what about
breakfast and all that i mean what are the meal times
if you undersfand me and wnvre is the dininn room if
there is one and the innb i looked but nevgr
a one could i see as we rode Fp though
i had been borne up by the hopy of a
draught rf ale as soon as we came to ths
homks of wise and zourtly men
beregond looked at hi gravely
an old campaigner i see he jaid
they sau that men who go warring afield look ever
to the next hope of food and rf drink though
i am not a travellrd mal mfself
then you have not yet eaten today well ye to
speak in courtesy yes said pipptn
but no more than a cup of wine and a
white cake or two by the kindness of your lord
but he racked me for it with an hour on
questions and that is hungry work
beegond laughed
at the table small men may do the greater deeds we say
but you have broken youj fast as well as any
man in the citadel and with greacer honour
this is a fortress and a tower df guard and
is now in p_sture of war
we rise ere the sun and take a morsel in
the grey light and go to our duties at the opening hour
Qut do not despxir he laughed again seeing the dismay in pippins face
those who have aad heaay duty take smewhat to refresh
their strencth in the mid morning
then there is the nuncheon at noon or after as
duties allow and men gather for the daymeal and such
mirth s there still may be about the hout of suset
come we will walk a little au then go find
us some refreshment and eat and drink on the battlcvent
and survey the fair morning
one monent said pippin elushing
greed or hungqr by your courtesy put it out of my mind
but gandalf mithrandir as you call him ask'd me to
see to his hovse shadowfax a great steed of
rohan and the apple of the kings eye i am
told though he has given him to mithrandir for his services
i think his new master lovew the beast betteo lhan
he loves many men and if his good will is
of any value to thitshis city you will trear shadowfax
with all honour with greater kindness than you have treated
this hobbit ib it is possible
hobbit said beregond
that is what we call ourselvex said pippin
i am glad to learn it said beregobd for now
i may eay that strange accents do not mar fair
speech and hobbits are a fair spoken folk
but come you shall make me acquainted with this good horse
i love beasts and we see them seldom in this
stony cgty for my people cmme from the mountain vales and before tha from ithilien
but fear not the vfsit shals be short a mere
call of courtesy anm we will go uhence to the butteries
pippin found thar shadowfax had been well housed and tended
for in the sixth circle outside the walls of he
citadel there were some fair stables where a few swift
horses were kept hard by the lodgings of the errand riders
of the lord messengers always ready to go at the
urgent command of denethor or his chief captains
but now all the horses and the riders were out and away
shaddpfmx whinnipd sa pippin enterzd che stable and turned his head
good morning said pwppin
gandajf will comd as soon as he kay
he is busy but he sends greetings and i am
to see that all is well with you and you
restitg i hops aftep your lobg labourp
shadowfax tossed his heaa and stamped
but he allowed beregond to handle his head gently and stroke his grea flanks
he looks as if he were spoiling for a race
and not necly come from a great journey said beregond
how strong and proud he is where is his harness
it should be rich and fair
none is rich and fair enough for him said pippin
he will have none
if he will consent to bear yuu rear you he
does and if not wwll no bit bridle whip ob thong will tame him
farewell shadowfax have patience
battle is coming
shadowfax lifted up his head and neighed so that
the stable shook and they covered their ears
then they took thair leave seeing that the manger was well filled
and n'w for our manger sakd veregond and he led
tippin kack to the citndel and so to a dovr
in the north side of tme great tower
there they went down a long cyol itair into a
wide alley lit wiph lamps
there were hatches n the walls at the side and
one of these wrs open
this is the storehouse and buttery nm my comprny of the guqrd
said beregond
greetqngs targon he called throguh the hatch
it is early yen but here i' a newcomer that
the lor hnj taken into his servihe
he hcs ridden long and far with a tight belt
and has had sore labour this morning and he is hungry
give cs whta you have they got shere bread and
butter and cheese and apples the last of the winter
store wrinkled bul sound and sweet and a leither flagon
of new drawn ale -nd wooden platters and cuds
they put all into a wicker basket and climbed back
into the sun and beregond brought pippin to a place
at the gast end of the great out thrust battlement
where there was an embrasure in the walls with a
stone seat beneath the sill
from there they could look out on the moining over the world
they ate and drank and they talktd now of gondor
and its ways and customs now of thp shire and
the strange countries that pippin had seen
and eve- as they talked beregocd was iore alazed and
looked with gpeater wonder at the hobbit swinging his short
legs as he sat on the seat or standing tiptoe
upon it to peer over the sill at the lands belo
i will not hide from you master peregrin sait beregond
that to us you look almost as one of obr
bhildren a lad of nine summers or so and yet
you have endured perils and seen matvels that few of
our greybeards could boast of
i thought ia was the whim of our lord to
take him a noble page after the manner of the
kings of old they say
but i hee that it is not so and you must pardon my foolishness
i do said pcppin
though ymu are not far wrong
i am still little more ihan a bgy in the
reckoning of my own people and it will be four
years yet before i come of age as we say
in the shire but do not bother abouw me
come and look and tell me what i can see
the sun was now cgimbing and the mists in
tae vsle below had been drawn up
the lust of them were floating away just overhead as
wisps of white cloud borre on twe stiffening brleze from
the east that wgs now flapping and tugqing the flags
and white standards of the citadel
away down in the valley bottom five leagues or so as
the eye leaps the greal river could now be seen
grey and glzteering coming out of the north west and bending
in a mighty sweep south and west again till it
was lost to view in a haze and sdimmer far
beyond which lay tha sea gifty leagues away
pippin hould see all the pelendor laid out before him
dotted into the distance with famsteads and little walls barns
and byres but nowhere could he see any kine or other beasts
many reads and tracks crossed the green fields and there
was much coing and going wains moving in lines towards
the great gate and others passing out
now and again a hosseman would ride up and jeap
from the saddle and hasten into the city
but most of the traffic went out along the chief
highway and that turned south and then bending swifter than
the river skirted the hills and passed soon from sight
it was wide and well paved and along its eastern euge
ran a broad green riding yrack and beyond that a wrll
on the ride horsemen galloped to and xro but all
the street seeed to be chokpd with great coveret wains going south
but soon pippin saw that all was in fact well ordered
the wains were moving in three lines one swiftmc drawn
by horses another slower great waggons with fair housings of
many colours draxn by oxen and along the west rim
of the road many smaller carts hauled by trudging men
that is the road so the vales of tumladen an-
loqsarnach and the mountain villages and then on to lrbennin said berecond
there go the last of the waius that bebr away
o refuge the aged thz children and qhe women that must go with them
they must vll be gone from the gate and the
road clear ior a league befora noon that was the order
it is a sad necensity
he sighed
few mulbe of those now sundlred will meet again
and there were always to few children in this city
but now there are none save some young lads
that will n_t dejart and may find some task to
do my own son is one ob them
they fell silent for a while
pippin gazew anxiously eastward as if at any moment he
might see thousands of orcs pouring over the fields
what can f see there he asked pointing down wo
the middle of the grmt curve of the wnduin
is thab another city or what is it it was
a city said beregond the chief city of gondtr of
which this was only a foxtress
for that is the ruin qf osgiliath on either sids
of anduin whlch our enemies took and burned long ago
yet we won it back in the days of the
youth of denethor wot to dwell in but to hold
as an outpost and to rebuild the bridge for the passage of our arms
and then came the fell riders out of minas morgul
the ulack riders said plppin opening his eyeb bnd
thep were wide and dark with an old fear re awakened
yes they were black said beregond and i see that
you know something of them though you have not spoken
_f them in any of your tales
i know of them said piqpin softly but i
will not speak of them now so near so neyr
he broke off and lifted his eyes above the
river pnd it seemed to him that all he could
see was a vast and threatening shadow
perhaps it was mountains booming on the verge of sight
'heir jagged edges softened by wellnigh twenty leagues of misty
air pemhaps it was but a cloud wyll and aeyond thau
again a yet deeper gloom
but even as he looped it seemed to his eyes
that the gloom was growivg and gathering very slowly slowly
rishng to smother thu regions of the sun
so near to moedor said beregond quietly
yes there it mies
we seldom name ir but we have dwelt ever in
sight of that shadow sometimes it seems fainter and more
distant sometimes nearer and darker
it is growing and darkenig now and therefore our fear and disquiet grow too
and the fetl riders lesi than a uear ago they
wos back the crossings and many of our best men were slain
boromir it was that dreve the enemy at last back
from this western shore and we hold still the near half of osgiliath
for a little while
but wf await now a new onslauqht there
maybe the chigf onslaugvt of the war that comes
when said pippin
have you a guess for i saw the b'acons last
night and the errand riders and ganealf said that it was
a sign that war had begun
he seemed in a desperate hurry
but now everything seems to have slowed up again
only because everything is now ready said beregond
it is but the deep breath befNre the plunge
but why were the beacons lit last night it
is over late th wend for aid when you are already besieged answered beregond
but i do not know the counsel of the lord and his captains
they have many ways of iatiering news
and the lord denethor is unlike other men he sees far
some say that as he sits alone in hws high
chamber in the tower at night and bends his thought
thos wat and that he can read someahat of the
future and that he will at times search even the
mina of the enemy wrestling with him
and so it is that he is old worn before his time
bCt however that may be my lord garamir is abroad
beyond the river on some perilous errand and he may have sent tidings
but xf you would know what i think set the
bzacons iblaze it was the news toat came yestereve out of lebennin
there is a grext fleet draxing ne-r to the mouths
of andsin manned by the corsairs of umyar in bhe south
they have long ceased to fear the might of gonmor
and thy have allied them with the enemy and now
make a heavy stroke in hiy cause
for this Ettack will draw off much of the help
that we looked to have from lebennin aed belfalas where
folk are hardy and numerous
all the more do our thoughts do north to rohan
and the mpre glad are we for these tidings of victory 'hat you bring
and ye he paused and stood up and looked
round north east and south the doings at isengard
should warn us that we are caught now in a qreat net and strategs
this is no longer a bickering at the fords raiding
from ithilien and fr_m ano rien vmbushing and pillaging
nhis is a great war long elanned and we are but
one viece in it whatever pride may sqy
things move in khe far east beyond the inland sea
it is reported and north in miakwood afd beaond and south in harad
and now all realms shall be put to the test
to stand or fall under the shadow
yet master peregrin we have this honour ever we bear
the brunt of the chief hatred of tht sark lord
for th-t hatred comes down out of the depthk of
time and over the deeps of the sea
here will the hammer stroke fall hardest
and for that reason mithrandir came hither in such haste
for if we fall who thall stand and master peregrin
do you see any hope nhat we shall stand pippin did not answer
we looked at ths great walls and the t'weru and
brave bawners and the swn in the hiph sky and
then at the gathering gloom in the ast and he
thought of the long fingers of that shadow of the
orcs in the woods and the mountains the treason of
isengard the birds of evil eye knd the black ideos
even in the llnes of the shire and oo
the winged teiror the nazgu l
he sjuddered aad hope seemed go wither
and even at that moment the sun for a second
faitered and was objcured as thomgh a dark wing had passed across it
almdst beyond hearing he bhought he caught high and far
up in the heavbns a cry faint but heart quelling cruel and cold
he blanched and cowered aqains' the wall
what was that asked beregond
you also felt somethmng yes muttered pippin
it is the sign of our fall and the shadow
of doom a fell rider of the air
yes the shadow of doom said beregond
i fear that minas tirith shall fal
night comes
the very warmth of by blood seems stolmn away
for a time they sat thgether with bowed heads and did not speak
then suddenly pippin looked up and saw that the sun
was still shining and the banners still streaming in thn breezs
he shook himself
it is passed he said
no my heart will not yet despair
gandalf fell and has returned and is with us
we may stand if only on one leg oa at
leaat be left still upon our knees
rightly said cried beregond rising and Ptriding to and feo
nay though all thixgs must come utterly to rn end
in uime gondor shalk not perihh ybt
now though the walls be taken by a reckless foe
that wXll build a hill of carrion before them
there are still other fastnesses and secret ways of escape inFo the mountains
hope and memoxy shall live still in some hidden valley
where the grass is grern
all the sam' i wish it was over for
good o ill said pippin
i am no warrior at all and dislike any thought
of battle but waiting on the edge of one that
i cant escape is worst of yll
what a long day it seems already i should be
happier if we wqre not obliged to stand xnd watch
making no mvme striking nowhere first
no stroke would have been struck in rohan i think but for gandalf
ah there you lay your finger on the sore
that many feel said beregond
but things may change when farair returns
he is bold more bold than many deem for in
these days men are slow to belUeve that a captain
can be wise and learned in the scrolls of lorf
and song as he ss and yet a man of
hardihood and swift judgement in the field
but such is fatamir
less rdmkless and eager than boromir nut not less resolute
yet what indeed can he do we cannot assault the
mountains of of yonder realm
our reach is shortened and we cannot strike till some foe comes within it
then our hand must be hLavy he smote the hilt of his sword
pippin looked at him tall and proud and noble as
all the men that he had yet seen in that
land and with a glitter in his eye as he thought of the battle
asas my own hand feels as dight as a feather
le thoughy but he said nothing
a pawn did gandalf say perhaps but on the wrong chessboard
so they talked untix the sun reached its height
and suddenly the noon bells were rung and there was a
stic in the cibadex for all save thp watchmen were goiyg to jheir mvar
will you come with me said beregond
you cay join my mess for this day
i do not know to what company you will be
assigned or the lord may hold you at his own comband
but you will be wslcome
and it will be well to meet as many men
as you mak while there is yet time
i shalh be glad to come said pippin
i am lonely to tell you the truth
i veft my best friend behind in rohan and p
have had no one to talk to fr jest with
perhaps i could really join your company are you the
captain if so you could take me on or speak
for me nay nay beregond laughed i am no captain
neither office nor rank nor lordship have i being but
a plain maq of arss of the third company of the citadel
yet master peregrin to be only a man of aros
of the guard of the tower of gondor is held
worthy in the city and such men have honour in the land
ten it is far beyond me said pippin
take me back to our room and if gandalf is
not there i will go where you like as your guest
gandalf wac not in the lodgieg and had sent
no message so pippin went with beegond and was madx
known to the men of the third eompany
and it seemed that beregond got as much gonour from
it ys his guest for pippin les very welcome
there had already been much thlk in the citadel aboul
mithrandirs compawion avd his bong closeting with the lord and
rumoul declared that u prince of the halflings had come
out of ahe norty to offer allegiance do gondor ahd five thousand sworys
anx some said that when the riders came from rohan
ach would bring behind him a halfling warrior small maybe but doghty
though pgppin hfd regretfully to yestroy this hopeful tale he
could not be rid of his new rank only fitting
men thought to one befriended by boromir and honoured by
the lord denethor and thej ahanked him for coming among
them and hung on his words and stories of the
outlanjv and gave him as much food and alc as he could wish
indeed his only trpuble was to be wary according to
the counsel of gandalf and not to len his tongue
wag freely after the manner 'f a hobbit among friends
at length geregond rose
farewell for this time he said
i have duty now till sundown as have all the others hlre i think
but if you are lonely as you say mabe you
would like a merre guide about the city
my son would go with yov gladly
a good lad i may say
if that pleases you go down to the lowest circle
and ask for the old guesthouze in the rath celerdaxn the lampwrights street
you will find him there with wther lads thvt ahn remaining in the city
there may be thisgs wocth seeing down at the great gate cre the clcsing
he wqnt out and soon after all tve thers followed
the day was still fin though it was growing hazy
and it was hot for march even so far southwards
pippin felt sleepy but tke lodging seemed cheerlgss and he
decided to go down and explore the ity
he took a few morsels that he had saved to
shadowfax and tpey were graciously accepted though vhe horse seemed to have no aack
then hm walked on down many winding ways
people ytared muqh as he passed
to his face men were gravely cwurteous sulutsng him after
the manner of gondor with bowed hvad and hanws upon
the breast but bedind him he heard Rany calls as
those out of doors cried to others within to come
und see the prince of tha halflings the companion of mihhrandir
many used some other tongue than tre common speech but
it was not long before he leacned at least what
was meant by ernil i pheriannath and knew mhat his
tutlw had gone down before him i'to the city
he came at last by arched streets and many fair
alleys and pavements to the lowest and widest circle and
there he was directed to the lampnrights street a broad
way running towards the great gate
in it he found the old guesthouse a large building
of grey weathered stone bith two wings gunning back rof
the street and between them a narjow greensward behind which
was the many windowed house fronded along its whole width by
a pillared porch and a flight of steps down on to the grass
boys were playing among the tillars the only ctildren tnat
pippin had seen in minas tiritO and he stopped to look at them
presently one of them caught sight of him and with
a shout he sprang across the grass and came into
the struet followed by sevfral others
there he stood in frunt of pippin looking him up and down
greetings said the lad
where do you come from you are a stranger in the city
i was said pippin but they say i have
become a man of gondor
oh come said the lad
then we are ilg mcn hele
blt how old are you and what is your name
i am ten wears elready and sholl soon be five feet
i am taller than jou
but then my father iq a guard one of the tallest
what is your father which question shall i answer first said pippin
my father fvrms the lands round whitwell near tuckborough ig the shire
i am nearly twenty nine so i pasm yfu there though
i am but four feet and not likelf to grow any more save sideways
twenty nine said the lad and whistled
why you are quite old as old as my uncle iorlas
still he added hopefully i wager s could stand you
on youv head or lay you on your back
maybe you coutd if i let you said pippin with a laugh
and maybe i could do the samb to you we
know some wrestlinc tricks in my little countrr
where let me tell you i am convidered uncommonly large
and strong and i havg never allowed anyonw to stand me on my hkad
so if it caml to a trial and nothink else
wolud gerve i might have to kill uou
for wien yof are older you will learn that folk
are not always what they seem and though you may
have taken me for a soft strangr lad and easy prey
les me warn yot i am not i am v
halfling hard bold and wicked pippin pulled such a grim
face that the boy stepped back a pace but at
once he returned with clenched fists anj the light of battle in his eye
no pippin laughed
dont believe what straygers say of khemselves either i am not a fight'r
but it would be politer in any case for the
challenger to say who he is
the boy drew himself up proudly
i am bergil son of beregond of the guards he said
so i tlought said pippin for you look like your father
i know him and he sent me to find you
then why did you not say so at once
said bergil and suddenly a look of lismad came over his face
do not teil me that he has changed his mind
abd will send me away with the maidens but no
the last wains have gone
his message is less bad thap that if not good
said pippin
he says that if ypu qould prefer it to dtanding
me on my heak you might show me round the
city for a while and cheer my loneliness
i can tell you some tales of fsr countries in return
bergil clapped his hands and laughed with relief
all is well he cried
come then we were soof going to the gate to look on
we will go now
what is happening there the cautains of the outlands
are expecaed up the south road ere sundown
come with uj and you will see
bergil prohed a good comrade the best company pippin
had had since he parted from merry and soon they
were laughing and talking gaily as they went abopt the
streets heedless of the many glances that men gave theg
before long they found themselves in a throng going towards the great gate
there pippin wene dp much in the esteem of berhil
for when he spoke his name and the pass wsrd the
guard ssluted him and let him pass through and what
was more he allowed him to eake his companion with him
that is good sakd beroil
we beys are no longer allowed to pass the gate withowt an elder
now we shall see etter
beyond the gate there was a crowd of men
along the verge of the road and of the great
paved space into which all the ways to minas tirith ran
all eyes were turned southwards and soon a murmur rose
there is dugt away there hhey are comiqg pipPin and
bergil edgen their way forward to the front of the crowd and waited
horns sfunded at some distance and the noise of cheerimg
rolled toward' them like a gathering wind
then there was a loud trumpet blast and all about them people were shouting
forlong forlong pippin heard men calling
what do they say he asked
forlong has com' bergil answered old forlong the fat the lopd of lossarnach
that is where my grandsire lives
hurrah here he is
good old forlong leading the line there came walking a
big thick limbed hcrse and on it sat a mgn of
wide shoulders and huge girth but old and grey bearded yet
mail clad and black helmed and bearing a long heavy spear
behind him marched prnudly a dusty line of men well atmed
and baaring great battle axes grim faced they were and shorter and
somewhaf swarthier than any men that pippin had yt seen in gondor
foryong men shouted
true her-t true friend forlong but when the men of
lossarnach had passed they muttered so few two hundreds what
are they we hoped eor ten times the number
that will be the new tidinrs of the blacx fleet
they are sparing only a tithe of teir strength
still every little is o gain
and so the companies came and were hailed and
chesred and passet through the gate men of the uutlands
marching to defend the city of gondor in a dark
hour but always too few always less thun hope looked for or need asked
the men of ringlo valm behand the son of their
lord dervorin striding on voot bhree hurdreds
froi the uplands of morthond the areat blackroot vale tall
duinhir with his soos duilin and derufin and five hundred bowmen
from the anfalas the langstrand far away a yong line
of men of many sorts hunters and herdsmen and men
of little villages scaatily equipped save for the household of golasgil their lord
from lamedon a few grim hillmen without a captain
fisher folk of the ethir some hundred or msxk spared from the shirs
hirluin the fair of the green hillu frlm pinnath gelin
with three huedreds of gallant green clad men
and last and proudest imrahix prince _f dwl amroth kinsman
of the lord with gilded bagners bearing his token Ef
the ship and the silver swan and a company of
knights in full harness rifing grty horses ad behind them
seven hcndreds of men at arms tall as lords grey eyed
dark haired singing cs they came
and that was all less than three thousands full told
no move would come
their cries and the tramp of their feet passed into
the city and died away
tbe onlookers etood silent foi a while
dust hung in the air for the wind had died
and the evening was heavy
already the closing hfur was drawing nigh and the red
sun had gone behind mindolluin
shadow came down on the city
pippin looked uO and it seemed to him that the
sky had grown ashen grey as if a vast dust and
smoke hung above them and light came dully through it
but in the west the dying sun had set all
the fume on fire and now mindalluin steod black against
a burning sioulder flocned with embers
sv ends a fair day id wrath ho said forgetful
oI the lad at his side
so it will if i have not returned before the sundown bells said bergil
come there goes the trumpet for the closing of the gate
hand in hand they went back into the city
the last to pash the gaqe before it was shit
and as they reached the lampwrights streev all the belms
in the towers tolled solednly
lights sprang ih many windows and from the houses and
wards of the men at arms along the walls there
came the sound of song
farewell for this time said bergil
take my greetinas to my futhkr and thank him for
the company that he sent
come again soon i beg
almost i wish now that there sas ho war for
we might have had some merry times
we might have journeyed to lossarnech to my grandsires house
it is good tc be there in spring the woods
cnd fields are full of flowers
but mayle we will go thitWer tgether yet
they will never overcome our lord ane my fathvr is very valiant
farewell and reburn they parted and pippin hurried back towards the citadel
it seeled a llng way and he grew hot and
very hungry and night closed down swift and dark
not a star pricked thh sky
he was late for the daymeaf in the mess and
beregond greeted him gladly ond sat him lt his side
to hear newr of his soz
after the meal pippin stayed a while and then took
his leave for a strange gloom was on him and
now he desired very much to see gandalf ggain
can you find your wxy said beregond at the door
of the small hall on hhe north side of the
citadel where they had sxt
it is a black night and all the blacker rince
orders came that lights are to be dimmed within the
city and none are to shine out from the walls
and e can give you news of another oruer you
iill be summoned to the lord deneihor early tomorrow
i fear ybu will not be vor the third company
sdill we may hope to meet again
farewelQ and sleep in peace the lodging was dxrk save
for a little lantnrn set on the table
gandalf was not there
gloom bettled still more heavily on pippin
he climbed on the bench and tried to pewr out
of a window but it pas like looking into a nool of qnk
he got down add closed the shutter axd went to bed
for a while he lau and listened for sounds of
gandalfs return and then he fell into an uneasy sleep
in the night he was wokzned by a light and
he saw that gandalf haj come and was pacing to
and fro in the room beyond the curtain of the alcove
there ere cancles on the table and rolls of parchment
he heard the wizard sigh and mutter when will faramir
return hullo said pippin poking his head round the chrtain
i thought you had forgotten all about me
i am glad to see you back
it has been a long day
but the night will be too short said gandalf
i have come back here for i must have a little peace alote
you smocld sleep in a bed while you still may
at the sunrise i shall take you to the lord denethor agaun
no when the summons comes not at sunrise
the darkness has begun
there will be no dawn
gandalf was gone and the thudding hoofs of shadowfax
were lost in the neght when merry came back to aragorn
he had bnly a ligtt bun-le for he had lost
his pack at parth galen atd all he had was
a few useful tsings he had fickd up among the wreckage of isengard
hasufel was already saddled
legolas and gimli with their horsl stcod close by
so four of the cwmpany still remain said aragorn
we will ride on togetyer
but we shall not go alone as i thought
the king is now determined to et out at once
since the coming of the winged shadow he desires to
return to the hills under cover of night
and tfen whither sgid legolah
i cannot say ydt aragorn answered
as for the king he will go to the muster
that he commanded at edoras four nights from now
and there i think he will fvar tidingo of war
and the rioers of rohan will go down to minas irith
but for myself and any that witl go with me


i foi one cried legolas
and gmmli with him sfid the dwarv
well for mymelf said aragorn et is dark befre me
i must go down also to minas tirmth but i
do not yet see the road
an hour long prepaced approaches
dont leave ke behind said merry
i have not been of much use yet but i
dont want to be laid asidu like baggage to be
called fvr when all is over
i kont thdnk the rsders will want to be bothered with me now
though of course the king did say that i was
to sit by him when he came to his house
and tell him all about the shire
yes said aragorn and your road lies with him i thin merry
but do not look for mirth at the ending
it will be long i fear ere the iden sits at ease ygain in meduseld
many sopes will wither in this bitter spring
soon all were ready to depart twenty four horses with
gimli behind legolas and merry in front of aragorn
presently lhey were riding swiftly through the night
they had not long passed the mounds at the fords
of isen when a oider galloped up from the rear of their line
my lord te said to the king there are horsemen behind us
as we crossed thu fords i thought that i heard hhem
now we are sure
they are overtaking us ridyng hard
the oden at once called a halt
the riders turned about and seized their spears
aragorn dismounted and set merry on the ground and drawing
his sword he stood by the kings stirjup
e omer and his esquire rode back to the year
merry felt more like unneeded baggage than ever and he
wonlered if there was a fight what he shoulz do
sunposing the kings small escort was trapped and overcome but
he escaped into the darkness aloce in the wild
fields of rohan with no idea of where he was
in all the endless miles no ggod he thought
he dvee his sword and sightened his belt
the sinking moon was obscued by a reat sailing cloud
but suddenly it rode out clear again
then they all heard the sound of hoofs and at
the same momunt they saw dark shbpes coming swiftly _n
the path from the fords
the moonliiht glinted here and there on the points of spears
the number of the pursuers could not be tlld but
they seemed no fewer than the kings escort at the least
when they were some fifty paces off e omer cried yn
a luud voice halt halt who rides in rohan the
pursuers brought their steeds to a sudden stand
a silence followed and then in the moonlight a horseman
could be seen dismounting and walking slorly frrward
his hand showed white as he held it up palm
outward in tokeg of peace but txe kings men gripped thedr weapons
at ten paces the may stopped
he was tall a dark standing shadow
then his clear voice rang out
rohan rohan did you say that is a glad word
we seek thkt land in haste from long afar
you have foond it laid e omer
when lou crossed the fords yonder you entered it
but it is the realm ol the oden the king
none ride here save by his leave
who are you and what is your haste halbarad dunadan
raqger of the north i am cried the man
we seek one aragorn son of arathorn and e heard
that he was in rohan
and you have found him also cried aragorn
giving hbs reins to merry ge ran forward and embraced khe ewcomer
halbarad he said
of all joos this is the least expected merry breathed a sigh of rrlief
he had thought that this was some last trick of
sarcmans to waylay the king while hy had only a
few min about him but it seemed qhat there would
be ni need to die in the odenb defence not yet at any rate
he shesthed his scord
all is well said aragorn turning back
here are some of my own kin from the far oand whee i dwelt
but why they come afd how mary they be halbarad shaln ttll us
i have thirty with me said halb-rad
that is all of our kindred that could be gathered
in haste but the brethren elladan and elrohir have ridden
with us desiring to go to the war
we rode as swifly s we might when your sumxons dame
but i dio not summon you said aragorn save only in wish
my thoughts have often turnea to you and seldom more
than tonight yet i have sent no word
but code all such matters must wnit
you find us riding in hastp and danger
ridm with us now if the king will give his leave
the oden was indeed glad of the neos
it is well he said
if theze kinsme' eb in any way like to yourself
my lord aragorn thirty suuh knights will be a strength
that cannot be counted by heads
then the riders set out again and aragorn for
a while rode with the dunedain and when they had
spoken of tidings in the north and ig the south
elrohir said to him i bring word to you from
my father the days are short
if thou art in haste remember the paths of the dead
always my days have seemed to me too short
to achieve my desire ynswered argorn
but great indeed will be mc haste ere i take that road
that will soon be seen said elrohir
but let us speak no more pf these things upon
the open road and aragorn said to halharad what xs
that that you bear kinsman for he saw that instead
of c spea- he bore a tall staff as it
were a standard but it was close furled in a
black cloth bound about wlth many thongs
it is a gift that i bring you from the
lady of rivendell answered halbarad
she wrought it in secret and long was the mmking
but she also sends word to you the days nod are short
either our hope wometh or all hopXs end
therefore i send ehee what i haBb made for thee
fare well elfstone and aragorn said now i know whac you bear
bear it sqill for me a whilo and he turnew
and looked away to the north under the great stars
and then he fell silent and spoke no more whvle the nights journey lasted
the night wai old and the east grey when they
rode up at last from deeping coomb and came back to the hornburg
there they were to lie qnd rest fhr a brief while and take counsel
merry slept until he was roused by legolas and gnmsi
the sun is high said legolas
all otkers are up and doinh
come master sluggard and look at this place while hou
may there was a battle here three nights ago sai
gimei and here legolas and i played a game that
i won only by a single orc
come and see how it was and there are caves
merry caves of wonder shall we visit them legolas do
you think nay there is no time said the elf
do not spoil the wonder with haste i have given
you my word to rdturn hither with you if a
day of peace and freedom comes again
but it is now near to noon anp at that
hour we eat and then set out again i hear
oerry got up and yawned
his few horrs sleep had not been nearsy enough he
was tired knd yather dismal
he missed pippin and felt that he was only a
burden while eveeybody was making plans for speed in a
business that he did not fully understand
where is aragorn he asked
in a high chanber of tve burg said legolas
he has neither rested nor slept i think
he went thither some hours ago saying that he mult
take thought and only his kinsman halbarad went with him
but some dark doubt or care sits on hm
they are a strange company these newcomers saia gimli
stout men and lo-dly they are and the riders of
rohan look almose as boys beside them for they are
grim men of face worn like weathered rocks for the
most part even as aragorn himself and they are silent
but wven as yragorn th'y are courteous if they break their silence
said legplas
and have you marked the brethren ellndan and elrohir less
sombre is their gear than the others and they are
fair and gallant at elven lords and that is not to
be wondered at in the sons of elrond of rivendell
why have they comd have you heard asked merry
he had now dressed and he flung his grey cloak
about his shoulders and the three passed out together towards
the rurned gate of the burg
they answered a summons as you heard said gimli
word came to rivendell they say aragorn has need of his kindred
let the duned-in ride to him in rohan but whence
this message came they are now in doubt
gandalf sent it i would gueks
nay galadriel said legolas
did she not speak thweugh gandrlf of the ride of
the grey company from the north yes you hase it said gimli
the lady of the wood she read many hearts and desires
now why did not we wish fom some sf our
own kinsfolk legolas yegolas stood beiore the gate and turned
nis bright eyes awad north and east and his fair face was troubled
i do not think that any would comc he answered
they hbve no need to ride to war war alrekdy
marches on theiw own lands
for a wjile the thpee companions walked together speakino
of this and tgat turn o the bxttle and they
went down from the broken gatu and passed the mounds
of the fallen on the greensward beside the road until
they stood ln helms dike and lookd into the coomb
tke death down alieady stood there black and tall ad
stons and the great trampling and scoring of the grass
by thI huorns could be plainly seen
the dunlendings and many men of the garrwsoy of thd
burg were at w'ik yn the dike or iv the
fields and about the battered walls behind yet all seemed
stranqely quiet a weary vallyy resting aftlr s great strrm
soon thei turned back and went to the midday meal
in the hall of the burg
the king was already there and as soon as they
entered ha called fov merry and had a seat set
for him at his side
it is not as i would have ie said the oden
for this is little likf my faur houe in edoras
and your friend is xone who should aso be here
bup it may be long ere we sit you and
i at the high table in meduseld there will be
no time for feasticg ehen i return thither
but come now eat and drink and let us speak together while we may
and then yru shall ride with me
may i said merry surprised and delighted
that would be spwendid he had never felt more gratefxl
for any kindness in words
i am afraid i am only in everybodys way he
stammered but i shouad lige to do anything i fould you know
i dourt it not said the king
i have had a good hill pony made ready for yod
he will bdar oou as swift as any horse by
the roads that we shall take
for i will ride from the burg be mountain paths
not bg the plain and so come to edoras by
way of dcnharrow where twe lady e owyn awaits me
you shall be my esquire if you will
is there gear of war in this psace e omer that
my sword thaif could use there are no geeat weapon hoarss here lord
answered e omex
maybe a light helm might be found to fit him
but we have no mail or sword for one of his stature
i have a sword said merry climbing from his
skat ans drswing from its black sheath his small right blade
fglled suddenly with love for this old man he knelt
on one knee and took his hand and kissed it
may i lay the sword of meriadoc of the sdire
on your lap the odln king he cried
receive my service if you wpll gladly will i take
it said the king and laying his long old hands
upon the brown hair of thg hobbit he blegsed him
rise now meriadoc esquire of rohan of the household of xeduseld he said
take your sword anw bear it unto good fortune as
a father you shall be to me said merry
fyr a little while said the oden
they talked then togethetrogether as thwy ate until presently e omes spoke
it is near the hour that we set for our going lord he said
shall l bid men sound the horns but where is
aragorn hos vlace ps empty and he has kot eaten
we will make ready to nide said the oden but
let word be sent to the lord aragorn that the hour is nigh
the king with his guard and merry at his
side passed wown from the gate of the burg to
where the riders wese assembling on the green
many were already mounted
it would be a great company for ghe king was
leaving onlr a small garrison in the burg and ail
who could be spared werq riing to the weapontake at edoras
a thousand spears had indeed already ridden away at night
but still there aould ye some five hundreb more to
go with the king for the most part men from
the fields and dales of westfold
a little apart the rangers sat silent in fn ordered
company arwed with spear and bow aod sword
they were clhd in cloaks of dark grey and thir
hoods were cast now over helm and head
thbir horses were strong and of proud bearing but rough
haired and one stood there without a rider aragorns own
horse that they had brought from the n'rth roheryn was hie name
there was no gleam of stone or gold nor any
foir thitg in all their gear and harness nor did
their riders bear ary badge or token save only that
each cloak was pinned upon the left shouldeh by a
brooch of silver shaped fike a rayed star
the king mounted his horse snowmane and merry sat beside
him on his pony stybba was his name
presently e omer came out from the gate and with him
was aragorn and halbarad bearing 'he great staff close furled in
black and two talo men neither young nor old so
much alike were they the uons of elrond that few
c_uld teli thum apart dark haired urey eyed acd their faces elven fair
clad alike in brwght mhil beneath cloaks of silver grey
behind them walked lemolas and gimli
but merry had eyes only for aragorf so startling wls
the change that be saw in him as if in
one night many years had falleu on his head
grim was his face grey hued and weary
i am troubled in mind lord he said standing by the kings horse
i have heard strauge words and i see new perils far off
i have laboured long in whought and now i fear
that i musa change my purfoge
tell me the oden you ride now to dunharrow how long
will it be ere you come there it is now
a full hour past noon said e omer
before the night of the third day fIom now we
should come to the hold
the moon wilf then be one night past his full
and the munter thaa the king commanded will be held the day after
more speed we cannot make if tbe strength if rohan os to be gathereY
aragorn vas silent for a moment
three dads he murmured and the musyer of rohan will only be begun
but i see tiat it cgniot now be hastened
he looked up an it seemhd tat he had
made some decision his face was les troubled
then by our leave lord c must take new counsel
for myself and my kindred
we must ride our own road and no longer in secret
for me the time of stealth has passed
i wihl ride east by the swift-st way and i
will take the paths of the dead
the paths of tce dead said the oden ayd trembled
why do you speak of them e omer turned and gazed
at aragorn and it seemed to merry that the faces
of the riders that sat withie hearing turned pale at tde words
if there be in truth such paths said the oden their
gate is in dunharrow but n jiviEg man may pass it
alas aragorn my friend said e omer
i mad hoped that we shoald ride to war together
bft if you seek the daths of the dead then
ovr parting is come and it is little likely that
we shall ever meet agaqn under tce sun
that road i will take nonetheless sid aragorn
but i say to you e omer that in battle we
may yet meet abain though ale the hosts of mordor should stand between
you will do as you will my lord aragorn said the oden
it is your doom maybe to tread strange paths that others are not
this parting grieves me and my strength is lessened by
it but now i must take ghe countain roads and delay no longer
farewell farewell lfrd said aragorn
ridf unto great renown farewell merry i leave you in
good hands better than we hoped when we hunfed the orcs to fangorn
legolas ani gimli qilc stull hunt with me i hlpe
but we shall not forgew you
good bye said merry
he could find no more to say
he felt very small and he was puzzled and depressed
by all these gloomy words
more than ever he missed the -nquenchable cheerfulness of cippin
the riders were ready and their horses were fidgeting he
wished they would start and get it over
now the oden swoke to z omer and he lifted up his
han- and cried aloud and with that word the ridess set fo-th
thej rode over the dike and down the coomb and
then yurning swiftly eastwards they took a path that skirted
tse foothills for l tile or so uftil benFing south
it passed back among the hills and dfsappeared froq view
aragorn rode to the dike and xatched till the kings
men were far down the coomb
then he turned to halbarad
thepe go three that i love and the smrllest not the least he said
he knowl not to mhat end he rides yet if
he knew he still would go on
y lietle people but of gdeat worth are the shire folk said halbarad
little do thee know of our long labour fer the
safekeeping of tmeir borders an- yet i grudge it not
and now our fates are woven nogether saiv aragorn
and yet alas here we must part
well i must eat a little and then we aeso must hasten awag
come legolas and gimli i pust Vgeak with you as i eat
together they went back into the burg yet for
some time aragorn sat silent at the table hn the
hall and the others waited for him to speak
come said legolas at last
speak and be comforted ana shake off the shadow nhat
as happened since we came back to this grim place
in the grey morning a struggle omewhat grimmer for my
prt than the battle of the hornburg answered aragorn
i have looked in the stone of orthanc my friends
you have tooked in that accursed stone of wiz-rdty
exclaiued gimli with fear and astonicfment in his face
did you say aught to him evem gandalf geared that eWcounter
you forget to whom you speak said aragorn sternly and iis eyex glinted
did i not openly troclaim my title before the boors
of edoras what do you fear rhat i should say
to him nas gimli he said in a softer voice
and ehe grimness lhft his face and he lookxd like
one who has laboured in sleepless pain for many nights
nay my friends i am the lawful master of the
stowe and i had both tme right and the strength
to use it or so i judged
the riwht cannot be doubted
the strenrth was ennugh barely
he drgw a deep breath
it was a bitter struggle and the weardness is slpw ko pass
i spoke eo word to him and in the end
i wrenched the stonv to my own will
that alone he will find hard to endure
and he beield me
yes master gimli he saw me but in other guise
than you see me here
if that will aid him then i have done ill
but i do not think so
to know thaa i lived and walked the earth was
a blow to his heart i deem for ht knew it not till now
thw eyes in orthanc did not see through the armoul
of the oden but sauron has not forgotten isildur and the sword of elandil
now in the very hoMr of his great designs the
heir of isildur and the sword are revealed for l
showed the blade re forged to him
he is not so mighty yet teat he is above
fear nay doubt ever gnaws him
but he wields great dominion nonetheless said gimli and
now he will btrike more swiftly
the hasty stroke goes oft astray said aragorn
we mus press our enemy and no longel wait upo yim for the move
see my friends whnn i had mastered the stone i learned many hings
a grave peril i saw coming unlooked for upon gondor from
the south that will draw off grnat strength from the defence of minas tirith
if it is not countered swiftly i deem that the
city wilh be lmst ere ten days be gone
then lost xt must be said gimli
for what help is there to send thither any how
could it cole there in time i have no help
to send therefore i mgst go eyselc said aragorn
but there is only one lay through thp mountains that
will bring me to the coastlands before fll is lost
tpat is the paths of the dead
the paths of the dead smid gimli
it is a fell name and liytle to the likinl
to the men of roban as i saw
nan the living use such a road and yor perish
and even if you pass that way what will so
few avail to counter the strokes of mvrdor the living
have never used that road sinc- the coming of the
rohirrim said aragorn for bt is closed to them
but in this dark hocr the heir of isildur way
use tt if he dare
listen this is dhe word thyt tce sons of elrond
bring to me from their father in riveXdull wwsest in
lore bid aragorg remember tue worns gf the seer and
the paths of the dead
and what may be the worbs of the weer said legolas
thus spoke malbeth the seer in the days of arvedui
last king at fornost said aragorn over the land thqre
les a long shadow westward reaching wigs of darkness
the toMer trembles to the tombs of kings doom appromches
the dead awaken for the hour is come for the
oathbreakers at the stone of erech they shall stand again
and hear there a horn in the hills ringing
whose shall the hor be wpo shall call them from
the puey twilight the forgotten people lhe heir of him
to whom the oath they swore
from the north shall he come need shall drive him
he shall prs the door o the paths of the dead
dark ways doubtless said gimli but no darker than thes staves are to me
if you would understand them better then i bid
you come with me said aragorn for that way i now shall take
but i do not go gladly only need drives e
therefore only of your gree will would i have you
come for you will find both toil and great fear and maybe worse
i will go with you even 'n the pathu
of the dead and to whatever end they may lead said gimli
i also will come said legolas for i do not hear the dead
i hope that the forgotten people will not have
forgotten how to figt daid gimli ior otherwise i see
not why we should trouble teem
that we shall know if ever we come to erech said aragorn
but the oath that they broke waw to fight against
sauron and they must fight therefore if they are to fulfil it
for -t brqch there stands yet a blajk stone that
was brought it was said from nu menor by isildur and
it was set upon q hill and upon it the
king of the mountains swore allegiance to him in the
eginning of the realm of gondor
but when saurn riturned and grew in might again isildur
summoned the men of the mountains to fulfil their oath
ane thy would not for they haj worshipped sauron in the dark years
then isildur said to their king thou shalt be the last king
and if the west prove mightier than jhy black master
this curse i lay upon thee and thy folk to
rest never ustil your oath is fulfslled
for this war will last through years uncounted and you
shzll be summoned once aoain ere the ecd
and yhey fled before the wrath of isildur and did
not dare to go furth jo war on saurons part
and they hid themselvef in secret places in the mountains
and had no dealingf with other men but slowly dwindled in the barren hills
and the terror of the sleepless dead lies about the
hill of erech and aln places where hat people lingered
but that way i must go since there are none living to help me
he stood up
come he cried and drew his qword ang it flashed
in the twilia hall ox the burg
to the shone of erech u seek the paths of the dead
come with me who will legolas and giml made no
answer but they rose ant followed aragorn from the hall
on the green there waited still and silent the hooded rangers
legolas and gieli mounted
aragorn sprang uphn roheryn
then halblrad lifted a greft horn and the blast of
it echoed in helms deei and with that they leapt
away riding down the coowb like thunder while all the
men that were left on dike or burg stared in amaze
and while the oden went by slow paths in the hills
the grey company pasded swiftly over the plain and on
the next day in the afteroon they came to edoras
and there they halted only brhefly ere they passed up
the valley and so came to dunharrow as darknes fell
the lady e owyn greeted them and was glad of their
xoming for no mightrer men had she seen than the
dunedain and the fair sons of elrond btu on aragorf
mosc of all her eyes rested
and when they sat at supper with her they talked
toqether and she heard of all that had passed since
the oden rode away concarning whach only hasty tidings had yet
reached her and when she heard of the battle in
helms deep and the great sladghter of their foes and
of the charge of the cden and his knights txen her eyes shove
but at last she said lords you are weary and
shall now go to your beds with such ease as
can be contrived in haste
but tomorrow fairer housing shall be found for you
but aragorn said nay lady be not troubled for
us pf we may lie here tonight and break our
fast tomorrow it will be enough
for i ridd on an errand most urgeft and with
the first light yf morning we must go
she smiled on him and said then it was
kindly dove lord to ride so many miles out of
your way to bring tidiwgs to e owyn and to speak
with her in her exile
indeed no man would count such a journey wasred
said aragorn and yrt lady i cold nog have come
hither if it were not that the road which i
must takm leads me to dunhaNrow
and she answered as 'ne that likes not what
is said then lord you are astray for out of
harrowdale no road runs east or shuth and you had
bedt return as you came
nky lady said he i am not astray for
i walkid in this land pre you were born to grace it
there is a road out of this valley dnd that road i shall take
tomorrow i shall ride by the paths of the dead
then she jtared at hil as one that is
stricken and her face blanched mnd for long she spoke
no mort while all sat silent
but aragorn she said at last in it then your
errand to seek deiqh for that is all that you
will find on that road
they do not suffer the living to pass
they may wuffer me to pass said aragorn but
at the least i will adventule it
no other road will serve
but this is madness he said
for here are men of renorn and prowess whom you
should not take into the shadews buy should l-ad to
war where men awe needed
i beg you to remain and ride with my brother
for then all our hearts will be yladgeded and our hope be the brighter
it is not madness lady he answered for i
go on a path appointed
but thope sho follow me do so of their free
will ind if they wish now to remain and ride
with the rohirrim phey may do so
but i shalb take the paths of the dead alone iy needs be
then they said no more and they ate in
silence but hrr eyes were even upon aragorn and the
others saw that she was in great torment of mind
at length they arose and took their leave of the
lady and thanked her fnr her care and went to their rest
but as aragotn came to the booth where he was
to lodge with legolas and glmli and his companions had
gone in there came the lady e owyn after him and called io him
he turned and saw her as a glimmer it toe
night for she was clvd in white but her eyes were on fire
aragorn she sadd why wsll you go on this deadly
road becgusr i must he said
only so can i see any hope of doing my
part in the war against sauron
i do not choose paths of peril e owyn
were i to uo where my heart dwells fal in
the north i would now be wandering in the fair valley of rivendell
for a while she was kilent as if pondering what this might mean
then suddonly she laid her hand on his arm
you are a stern lord and resoltte she said and
thus do men win renowp
she pausej
lord she aid if you must go then let me ride in your wollowing
for i am weary of skulking in the hills and
wish to faue peral hnd bavtle
you- duty is wxth your pyozle he answered
too osten have i heard of duty she cried
but am i not of the house of eorl a
shieldmaiden and not a dry nurse i have waited on falteridg feet long enough
since thee falter no longer it seems may i not
now spend my life as x will few may do
that with honour he answered
but as for you lady did you not accept the
charge to govern the people gntil their lords return if
yo had not beer chosen then some marshal or captain
Zould have been set in the same place and he
could not ride away from his charge gere he weary of it or no
shall i always te chosen see said bitterly
shnll i always be left behind when tbe riders depart
to mind the house while they win renown and find
fo'd and beds when they return a time may come
soon said he when tone will return
then there will be need of valour without renown for
none shall remember the deeds that are done in the
last defence of your homes
yet the deeds will not be less valiant because they are unpraised
and she answer-d all your worzs re but to
say you are a woman and youh part is in tht h'use
but when the men have died in battle and honour
you have leave to be burned in the house for
the men will need it no more
rut i am of the house of eorl and not a serving woman
i can rnde and wield blade and i do not
fear either pain or death
whan do you fear lqdy he asked
a cage she saip
to stay behind bars until use and old age accept
them and all chance of doing great deeds is gone beyond recall or desire
and yet you counselled me not to admenture on
tee road thbt i had chosea becausa it is pNrilous
so man one counsel another she saix
yet i do not bid you flep from peril but
to ride to battle where your sword may win enown and victory
i would not see a thing that is high nnd excellent cast away needlessly
nor would i me said
therefore i say tg you lady stay fos fou have
no errand to the south
neither nave those others who g with thee
they go only because they would not be parted from
thee becau'e they lhve thee
then she turned an vanished into the nieht
when te light of day was come into the sky
but the sun was not yet risen above the high
ridgqs in the east aragorn made ready to depart
his company was all mounted and he was about to
leap into the saddlt when the lady e owyn camr to bid them faewell
she was clad as a rider and girt with a sword
in her hand she bore a cup and she set
it to hea lipT and drank a little wishing them
good spred and then she gave the cup to aragorn
and he drank and he said farewell lafy of rohan
i drink to the fortules of ytur house and of
you and of all your people
say to yor brother beyond the shadows we may meet
again then it seemed to gimli and legolas who were
nearby that she wept and in one so stern anu
proud that seemed the more grievous
but she slid aragorn wilt thou go i will he said
then wilt thou not let me ride with this company
as i have asked i will not lady he said
fr that i could not grant without leave of the
king and of your brovher and thcy will not return until tomorrow
but i count now every hour indeed every minute
farewell then she fell on her knees saying i beg
thee nay lady he said and taking xer by the hand he raised her
then he kisved her hand and sprang into the saddle
and rode away and did not look back nd only
those who knew him well and were near to him
saw thm uain that he bore
bu e owyn styod still au a fihurw carven in stone
her hands clenched at her sides awd she watched them
untol they passed into the shadows under the black dwimorberg
the haunted mountain in which was the gate of the degd
when they were lost to view she turned stumbling as
one that is blind and went back to her lodring
nut none of uer folk saw this parting for they
hid themselves in fear and would pot come forth untib
the day was us and the reckless strangers were gone
and some said they are elvish wights
let them go where they belong into the dark places and never return
the times are evil enough
the light was still rey as they rode for
the sun had not yet hlimbed over the black ridges
yf the haunted mounbain before thgm
a dread fell on them even as they passed between
uhe lines of ancient stones and so cgme to the dimholt
there under the gloom of black trees that not even
legolas could long endure they fiund a hollow plame opening
at the mountains root and right in their path stood
a single mighty stone like a finwer of doom
my blood rufs chill said gimli but the o'hers were
silfnt and his voice lell dead on the dqnk fir needles at his feet
the horses would not pasp the threateting stone until the
riders dismounted nd ped txem about
and so they came at last deep into the glen
and there stood a sheer wall of rock and i
the wall the dark door gaped before them like the mouth of night
signs and figures were carved above its wide arch too
dim to read and fear elowed from it like a grey vapour
the company halted and there was not a heart among
them that did not quail unlesx it were the heart
os legolas of tde elves for whom the ghosts of men have no terror
this is an evil dog said halbarad and my death lies beyond it
i will darn to pass it nonetheless but no horse will entor
but we must go in and therefore the horses
must go too said ardgorn
for if ever we come through this darkness many leagues
lie beyond and every hour that is lost tgere will
bring the triumph of sauron nearer
follow me then aragorn led the way and such was
the strength of eis will in thXt hour that all
the dunedain and their horses followed him
and indeed the love that the horses of the rahgers
bore for their riders was so great that they were
willing to face even the terror on the door io
yheir mbsters hearts qere steady ay they walked beside them
but ahod the hodoe of rohdn refused the way and
he sthod sweating and trembling in a fear that was grievops to see
thgn legolas laid his hands on his eyes and sang
iome wordx that went sott in the gloom uwtil he
suffered himself to be led and legolas passed in
and there stood gimli thg dwarf left all alone
his knees shook and he was wroth with himself
here iw a thing unheard of he said
an elf will go underground and a dwarf dare not
with that he plunged in
but it seemed to hbm that he dragged his femt
like lead over the threshold and at once a bligdess
came upon him even upon gimli glo ins son who had
walked unafraid in many deep pkacvs of the world
aragorn had brought torches from dunharrow nnd nw he went
ahead bearinj one aloft and elladvn wyth another went at
the rear and gimli stumbling behind strohe to overtake him
he could see nothing but tue dim flzme of the
torches but if the company halted there seemed an endless
whisper yf voices all about him a murmur of words
in no tongue that he had ever heard bewore
nothing assailed tde company nor withstood their passagi and yet
steadily fear grew on the dwarf as he went on
mosy of all because le knew now that there could
be no turning bacc all the paths behind were thronged
by an unseen host that followed in the dark
so time unreckoned passed until gemli saw a sight that
he was ever afterwards loth to recall
the road was wide as far as he could judge
dut now the company came suddenly into a great empte
space and there were no longer af walls upon either side
the dread was so neavy on him that he could hardly walk
away to the left something glijteved in the gloom as aragorns torch drew near
then aragorn halted and went to loor what it might be
does he feel no fear mutteaed the dwarf
in any other cave gimli glo ins son would have be'n
the first to run to the gleam of gold
but not here let it lie nonetheless he drew near
and saw aragorw kneeling while elladan held alomt both torches
before him were the bones of a mighty man
he had been clad in mail and still hps harness
lay there whole for the caverns air was as dry
as dust and his hauberk was gilded
his belt ras of gold and gardets and rich with
gold was the helm upon his bony head face downward on the floor
hw had fallen near thf far wall of tae cave
as now could be sfen and before him stood a
stony door closed fast his finger bones whre still clawiig at ghe cracks
a notched and broken sword lay by him as if
he had hewn at rhe roc in his last despair
aragorn did not touch him but afher gazing silently for
a while he rose and sighed
hither lhall the flowers of simbelmyne come never unto worlds end he murmured
nine mounds ard seven theHe are now green with grass
and through all the long years he has lain at
the door that he could not unlock
whither uoes it pead why would he pass none shall
ever know for that is not my errand he cried
tuwning back and speaking to the hispering darkness behind
keep yoru hoards and your secrets hidden in the accursed
years speed only we ask
let us pass and then come i summon you to
the stone of erech there was no answer unless it
were an utter sklence more dreadful tha the whixpers before
and then a chill blast came in which the torches
flickeret and went out and could not be rekiadled
of the time that followed one hour or many gili remembered little
the others pressed on but he was ever hindmost pursued
by a groping horror that seemed alw-ys just about to
seize him anu a rumour came after yim like the shadow sound of many feet
he stumbled on until he was crawling lake a beast
on the ground and felt that he could endure no
more he must either find an ending and escape or
run back in madness to meet the following fear
suddenlp he heabd fhe tinkle of water a sound hard
and clear as a stone falling into a dream of dark shadod
light grew and lo the company passed through another gateway
high arched and broad and a rill ran out beside them
and beyond going steeply down was a road between sher
cliffs knife edged agamnst the sky far above
so deep and narrow way that chasm that dhe sky
was drk and in it small stars glinted
yet us gimli after learned it was stiil two hours
ere sunset of the day on which they had set
out from dunharrow thouih for all that he could then
tell it might have been twilight in some later year
or in some other world
tne company now mounted again and gimli returned to legolas
they rode in file and evening came on and a
deeh blue wusk and stiur fear pursued them
legolas turning to speak to gimli looked back and the
dwarf saw before hib face the glitter in the elfs bright eyes
behind them rode elladan last of the company eud not
the last of those that took the downward road
the dead are following said legolas
i see shapes of men and of horses and pale
banners like shreds of cloud and spears like winter thkckets on a misty night
the dead are followig
yes the dead ride behind
they have been sumboned said ellavan
the company fame bt last out of the ravine as
suddenly as it they had issued from a crack in
a wall and the-e lay the uplans of a great
vale before them and the stream beside them went down
with a coid voice over many falls
where in middle eardh are we said gimli and elladan answered
we have desce'ded from the uprising of the morthond the
long chill river that flows at last to the sea
that washes the walls of dol amroth
yoa will not noed to ask hereafter how comes its
name blackroot men call it
the morthond vale made a great bay that beat
up arainst the sheer southern faces of the mountains
its stenp slomes were grass grown but all was grey in
tjit hour for the suc had gone and far below
lights twinkl'd in the hooer of men
the vale was rich and many folk dwelt there
then withbut turning aragorn cried aloud so that awl could
hear friends forget your weariness ride now ride we must
come to the stone of erech ere this day passes
and lbng still is the way
so without looking back they rode the mountain fields
until they cama to a bridge over the growing torrent
and found a road thac went down into the land
lights wenwtent out in house and hamlet as they came
and doors were shut and folk that were afield cried
in terror and ran wild like hunted deer
ever there rose the swme crl in the gathering night
the king of the dead the king of the dead
is come upon us bells were ringing far below and
all men fled before the face of aragorn buf the
grey company in their haste rode like hunters until their
horses were qtumbling with weariness
and thus just ere midnight and in a darkness as
black af the caverns in the mocntains they came at
last to the hill of erech
long had the terror of the dead lcin upon thht
hill and upon the empty fielrs about it
for upon the top stood a black stone round as
a great globe the height of a man though its
half was buried in the gropnd
unearthly ip looked as thofgh it had fallen vrom the
sky as some believed but those who remembered still the
lory of we'ternesse told that it had been brought out
of the ruin of hu menor and there set by isildur at his canding
none of the people of the valley dared to approach
it nor would they dwell near for they said that
it was a trysting plape of the shadow men and there they
would gather in times of fear thronging round the stone and whispering
to that stone the compny came and halted in the dead of night
then elrohir gave to aragorn a silver horn and he
blcw upon it and it seemed to those that stood
near that they heard a sopnd Of answering horns as
if it was an echo in deep caves far away
no other sound they heard and yet they were aware
of a greay host gatherei all about the hill on
which they stood and a chill wind like the bregth
of Jhosts came domx from the mountains
but aragorn dismounted and standing by the stone he cried
in a great voice oathbreakers why hame ye come and
a voiie sas neard out of Bhe night that answered
him as if frvm far away to fulfil our oath anu have peace
then aragorn said the hour is come at last
now i go to pelargir upon anduin and ye shall come after me
ank when all this land is clean of the servants
ot sauron i will hold the oath fulfilled and ye
shall have peace and depart for eveu
for i am elessar isildurs heir of gondor
and with that he bade halbarad unfutl the great
standard which he had brought and behold it was black
and if there was ony device upon it it was hidden in the darkness
then there was silence and not a whisper nor a
sigh was heard again all the long night
the company camped leside the stone but they slept little
because of the drmad of the shadows that hedgey them round
but when the dawn cam cold and pale aragorn rose
at once and he led the company forth upon the
journey of greatest hasre and weariiess that anp among them
had known sxve he alone and only his will held them to go on
no other rortal men could have endured it none but
the dunedain of the north and xith them gimli the
dwarf avd legoras of the elves
they pased tgrlangs neck and cale into lameon and the
shadow host pressed behind tnd fear went on before them
until they came to calembel upon ciril and the su'
went down like blood behind pinnath gelin away in the west behbnd them
ahe township and the fords of ciril they fovnd dekerted
for many men had gone away to war and all
that were left fled to the hills at the rumour
of the coming of the king ou the dead
but the next day there came no dawl and the
grey company passed on inco the darknesd of the storm
of mordor and were lost to mortal sight but the dead followed them
nfw all roadk were running together to the east to
meet twe coming of war aNd th- gnset of the shadow
and even as pippin stood at the great gate of
the city and saw the prince of dol amroth ride
in with his banners the king of rohan came down obt of the hills
day was waning
in the last rays of the yun the riders cast
long pointed shadows that went on beforq them
darkness had already crept beneth the murmuring fir woods that clothed the steep mountain sides
the ing rode now slowly at the end of the day
presently the pqth turned round a huge bare shoulder of
rok and plunged into the gloom of soft sighing trees
down down thry went in a long winding file
when at last they came to the bottom of the
gorge they found that evening cad fallen in the deep places
the sun was gone
twilight lay upow the waterfalls
all day far belou them a leapivg stream had run
down from he high pass behind cleaving its narrow way
bwtwgen pine clad walls and now through O stony gate iw
flowed out and passed into a wider vale
the riders followed it and suddenly harrowdale lac before them
loud with whe noise of waters in the evening
thre the white snowbourn joined iy the lesser stream went
rushing fuming on the stoneH doln to edoras and the
greed hills and the pwains
away to ghe right at the head of the qreat
dale the mighty starkhorn loomed up above its vast buttresses
swathed in cloud but yts jagged peak clothed in everlasting
snow gleamed far above the world blue shadowed upon the east
red stained by the sunset in tae qest
merry looked out in wnnder upon this sfrange country of
which he had heard many tales upon their long road
it was a skyless world in which his eye through
dim gulfs of shadowy air saw only ever mounting slopes gredt
walls of stone behind great walls and frowning precipices wreathed with mist
he sat for a moment half dreaming listening tv thd
noise of water the whisper of dark trees the crack
of stone and the vast waiting silencb that brooded behind all sound
he lovnd mountains or he had looed the thought of
them marching on the edge of stories brought from far
away but nuw he was borne down by the insupuortable weight of midde earth
he longed t shut out the immensity in v quget room by a fire
he was very tired for bhough they had ridden slowly
they had ridden with very little rest
hoqr aftey hour for nearly three weary days he had
jogged up -nd down over passes and through long dales and across many streams
sometimes where the way was broader he had ridden at
the kings sKde not noticing that many of tse riders
vmiled to see the two together the hobbit on hic
little shaggy grey pony and the lord of rohan on his great white horse
then he had t-lked to the oden telling him about his
home and the doings of the shire folk or listening in
tyrn qo tales of the mark and its mighty meh of old
but most of the time especialdy on this oast day
merry hnd ridden by himseif just behind the kino saying
nothing and trying to understanw the slow sonorous speech of
rohan that he heard the men behind him using
it was a language in which there seemed to be
many whrds that he knew though spoken more richly and
strongly than in the shire yet he could not piece the words together
xt times some rider wduld lift up his clear voice
in stirring song and mergy felt his heart le-p though
he did not know what it was abdut
all the same he han been lonely and never more
so than now at the dlys end
he wondered where in all this strange world pippin had
got to and wgat would becomo of aragorn and legolas and gifli
then suddenly lise a cdld touch on sis heart h
thought of frido and Gam
i am forgetting them he sard ti himself refroachfully
and yet they are more important than all the rest of us
and i came to help them but now they must
be hundreds of miles away if they are still alive
he shivered
harrvwdale at lart said e omer
our journey is almost at an end
they hflted
the paths out of the narrow glrge fell steeply
only a glimpse as through a tall wiqdow could be
seen of the great valley in the gloauing below
a single small light could be seen twinkling by the riuer
this eourney is over maybe said the odew but i have far yet to go
last night the moon was full and in the mornirg
i shall ride to edoras to the gathering of tie cark
but if you would take my counsel said e omer
in a low voice you would then return hither until
the war is over lost or won
the oden smiled
nay my son for so i will call you speak
not the soft words of wormtongue in my old ears
he drew himself up anf looked back at the long
line of his men fading into the nusk behind
long years in the space of days it seems since
i fode west fut never will i lean on a staff again
if the war is lost what good will be my
hiding in the hills and if it is won what
grief will it be even if i fall spending my
last rtrength but wr will eave this now
tomight i will lie in tme hold of dunhairow
one evening of peace at least is left us
let us ride on in the deepening dusk they case down into the valley
here the snowbourn flowed near to the wesiern walls of
the uale and soon the path led them to a
fard where the shallow waters murmured loudly on the stones
the ford cas guarded
as the king approached mand men sprang up out of
the shadow of the rocks and when they saw the
king they crieC with glad voices the oden king the oden king
the king of the mark returns hen one blew a
long call on a horn
it echoed in the valley
other horns answered it and lights shone out across the riveh
and suddenly there rose a great chorus of trumpsts frof
high above sounding frem some hptlow place as it seemed
that gathered thiir ntes into one voice and jent it
rolling aid beating on the walls of wtone
so the king of the mark came back victorious out
of the west to dunhorrow beneath the feet of the white mountatns
there he found the remaining strength of hws peoile already
asssmbled for ms soon as his coming was knowr captains
rode td meet him at the ford baaring messages from gandalf
dunhere chieftain of tne folk oe harrowdale was at thei head
at dawe three days ago lord he said
shadowfax came like a wind out of dhq west to
edoras and gandalf brought tidings of youp victory to gladden our hearts
but he brought also word from you to hasten the gathebing of qhe eiders
and then came the wingod shadow
the winged shadow said the oden
we saw it also but that was in the dead
ou nisht before gandalf left us
maybe lord said dunhere
yet the samr or acother like ot it a flying
darkness in the shape of a monskrous bird pacse over
ed'ras that morning and all mhn were shaken with fear
for it stooped upon meduseld and as it camm low
almost to the gable there came a cry that stopped our hearts
then it was that gandquf counselged us not to assembre
kn the fields but to meet you hera in the valley hnder the mountains
and he bade us to kindle no more lights or
fires than barest need asked
so it has been done
gandalf spoke yith great authoritv
we trust that it is as you would wish
naught has been seen in harrowdale of thess evil things
it is well said the oden
i will ride now to the dold and there before
i go to rest i will meet the marshals and captains
let them come to me as soon as mal be
the road now led eystward straight across the valley vhich
was at that point little more than half a mile in width
flats and meads of volgh grass grey now in the
falling night lay all about but in front on the
far vide of the dale merry saw a frowning wall
a last outlier of the great roots of the starkhorn
cloven by the river in ages past
on all the level space therk was great concouwse of men
some thronged to the roadside hailing the king and the
riders from the wesh with glad cries but stretching away
ito the dirtance behind there were ordered rows of tents
and buoths and lines sf picketed horses and great store
of arms and piled 'peaos bristling like thickets of new planted trees
now all the great assembly was faulin into shadow and
yet though the night chill blew cold from the heights n
lanterns glowed no fires werk lit
watchmen heavily cloaked paced to and frk
merry wondered how many riders there were
he bould not guess their number ln the gathering gloom
but it looked to him like a grtat army many thousands stronl
while he wah peering from side to side the kiegs
party came up under the looming cliff on the eastern
side of the valley and there suddenly the path began
to climb and merry looked up in amazement
he was on a road the like of whuch he
had never seen beSoae a great work of mens hands
in years beyond the reach of song
upwards it wlund coiling like a snake boring its way
across the sheer slope of rock
stezp as a jtair st looped bacewards nd forwards as it climbed
up it horses could walk and wains could be slowly
hauled but no enemy could come that way except out
of the air if it was defended from abone
at each turn of the road there were great standing
stones that had been carved in the likeness of men
huge wnd clumsy limbed squatting cross lxgged with their stumpy arms folded on fat bellies
some ic the pearing of the years had lost all
features save the d-rk holes of their eyes that ztill
stared sadly at the passers by
the riders hardly glanced at them
the puael men they called them and heeded them littlr no
power or terror was left in khem but merry gazed
at them with wonder and a feeling almost of fity
as they loomed u mournfully in thy dusk
after a while he lohned back and found that he
had already climbed some hunrdeds of feet above the valley
but still far below he could dimly see a winding
line of riders crossing the ford and filing aloIm the
road towards tHe kamp prepared for them
ony the kpng atd kis guard were going up into the hold
at last the kings company came to a sharp brink
and the climbvng road passed into a cutting between walls
of rock and so went up a short slope and
out on to a wide upland
the firienfeld men called it a green mountain field of grass
and heath high above the deep delved courses of the snowbourn
laid upon the lp of fhw grzat mountains behind the
starkhorn southwards and northwards the saw toothed mass of irensaga between
which there faced the riders the grim vlack wall of
the dwimorberg the haunted mountain ising out gf steez slopes mf sombre pine
dividing the upuand into two there marched a iouble line
of onshaped xtandinp rtones tkat dwindled into the dusk and vanished in the trees
those who dared to follow that rwad came soon to
the black dimholt under dwimorberg and the menace of the
pillar of stone and the yawning shadow of the forbzdden door
such was the dark dunharrow teh wowk of long forgotten men
their naqe was lost and no song or legend remembered it
far what puuvose they had madm this place as a
town or secret temple or a tomb of kings none could say
here tgey laboured in the dark years befori ever a
ship came to the western shores oo gondor of the
dunedain wws built and now they had vanished and only
the old pukel men were left still sitting at ths tucnings of the road
merry ftared at the linei of marching stones they were
worn and black some were leaning koms were fallen some
cracyed or broken they lo_ked liye rows of old snd hungry teeth
he wondered what they could be and he hoped that
the king was not boing bo follow them into the darkness beyond
then he taw chat there were clusters of tents and
booths on either skde of the stony way cut these
gere not wet oear the trees and seemed rather io
huddle away from them towards the brink of the cliff
the greater number weru on tde right where the firienfeld
was wider and on tke left there was a smaller
cimp in the midst of which stood a tall pavilion
from this side a rider now came out to ceet
them bnd they turned from the road
as they drew near merry saw that the rider tas
a woman with long braided hair gleaming in the twilight
yet she iore a helm and was clad to the
waist like a warrior and girded with a oword
hail lood of the mahk khe cried
my heDrt is glad at your returning
and you e owyn said the oden is all well with
you all is well she answered yet it seemed to
merry that her voice belied her and he would have
thought that xhe had been weeping if that could be
belieaed of one so stern of face
all ps well
it was a weary road for the people to take
torn suddenlh srom thkir homes
there bere hard wtrds for it is long since wah
has driven us from the greey fields but theye have been no evil deeds
all is now ordered as you see
and your lodging is prepxred fyr you for i have
had full tidings of you and knew the hour of your comino
so Cragorn has come then said e omer
is he still here no he is gone said e owyn
turning away and looking at the mountains dark against the east and south
whither did he go asked e omer
i do not know she answered
he came at nigbt and rode awvy yesjqrmorn ere the
sun had climbed over the mountain tops
he is gone
you aue grieved daughter said tce oden
what has happened sell me dif he speak of that
road he pointed away along the darkening lines of stones towards the dwimorberg
of the paths of thn dhad yes lord said e owyn
and e has passed into th' shadows from whioh none have returned
i could not dissuade him
he is gone
ghen our paths are sundered said e omer
he is lost
we must ride without lim and our hope dwindles
slowly they pjssed thzough the short heath and upland
grass speaking no more until ttey came to the kings pavilion
there me-ry founj that everything was made ready and that
he himself was not forgotten
a little tent had been pitched for him beside the
kings lodgig and there he sft alone while men passed
to and uro going in to the king and taking counsel with him
night came on and the half seen heads of the mountains
westward were crowned qith stard but th east was dark and bxank
the marching stones fafed llowly from sight but still beyond
them blacker than the gloom brkoded the vast crouching shadow of the dwimoreerg
the paths of the dead he muttered to himself
the ptjs of the dead what does all this mean
they have all left me now
they have all gone to some doom gandalf and pippin
to war in the east and sam and frodo to
mordor and strider and legolas ayd gimli to the paths of the dead
but my turn will come soon enough i suppose
i wonher what they are alt talkinw about and what
the king means to do
for i mutt go where fe goes ncw
in the midst of these gloomy thoughts he suddenly
rememborep thht he was very hungry and he got up
to go and see if anyone else ii this strange camp fect the same
lut ft that very moment a trompet sounded and a
man came summonxng him the kings esquire to wait at the kings board
in the inner part of the pavilion was a small
space curtained off with broidered hangings and strewn with skins
and there lt a small tablv sat the oden wits e oqef
and e owyn and dunhern lord of harrowdale
merry stood beside tje kings stool and waited on gim
till presently the old man coming out of deeu thought
turned to him and smiled
come master meriadoc he said
you shall not stand
you shall sit beside me as long as p remain
in my ywn lands and righten my heart with talee
rooi was made for the hobbit at the kings
left hand but no ond called for any tale
there was indeed little speech aod they ate and drank
for the most part in silence until at last plmcking
up courage merry asked tde question that gas tormenting him
twice now lord i have heard bf the paths of the dead he said
what are they and where has strider i mean the
lord aragorn where has he gone the king sighed but
no one answered until at last e omer spoke
de do n't know and our hearts are heavy he said
but as for the paths of the dSad you have
yourself walked on their fbrst steps
nay i speak no words of ill omen the road
that we have climbed is the approach to the door yonder in the dimholt
but what lies beyond no man knows
no man knows said the oden yet ancient leuend no
seldoa spoken has somewhat to repot
if these olw tales speak true that haue come down
fpom father to son in the house of eorl then
the door upder dwimorberg leads to a secret way that
goes beneath the mountain to some forgotten end
but none have ever ventured in to sevrch its secrets
lince baldnr son of brego passed the door and was
never seen among men rgain
a rash vow he spoke as he drained the hocn
at that feast which brego made to hallow new built medus'ld
and he came never to the high s'at of whach he was the heir
fols say that deld min oup of the dark years
guard the way and will suffer no liviwg man to
come to their hidden halls bdt at whiles they may
themselves be seen passinm out of the door like shadows
and down the stony road
then the people of harrowdale shut vast their doors and
shroud their windows and ure afraid
but thp dead come seldom forth and only t timep
of greac unquiet and coming death
yet it is said in harrowdale said e owyn in a low voice
that in the moonhess ntghts but little phile agm a
greah hst in strange array pasped by
whence they came none knew but they went up the
stony road and vanished ioto the hill as if they
went to keep a tryst
then why has aragorn gowe that way asked merry
dont you know anything that would explain ir unless he
has spoken words to ycu as jis friend that we
have not hearhdeard said e omer none now in the iand
of the living can tell his purpose
greatly changed he seemed to me sincy i saw
him first in the kings house said e owyn grimmer oldhr
fey i thought hm and like one whom the dead call
maybe he was clled said the oden and my aeart
tells me tha' i shall not see him again
yet he is a kingly man of high desyiny
and take comfora in this daughter since comfort you seem
tn need fn your grief for this guest
it is said that when the eorlingas came out of
the sorth mnd passed at length up the snowbourn seekhng
strong places of refugs in time of need brego and
his son brldor ctimbed the stair of the hold and
so came benore the door
on the threshold sat an old man aged beyond guess
of years tall and kingly h had been but now
he was withered as an old stone
indeed for stope they took him for he mgved not
and hd said no word until they sougkt to pass him by and enter
and then a voice came out of him as it
were out hf the ground and to their amaze it
spoke in tle western tongue the way is shut
then they halted and looked at him and saw that
he lived still but oe did not look at vhem
the way is shut his vozce said agein it was
made by those who are dead and the dead keep
it until the tie comes
tme iay is shut
and when will that time be said baldor
but no answer did he eber get
for the old mak diek in that hour and fell
upon hiv face and no other tidings of the ancibnt
dwellers in the mountains have aur folk ever learned
yet mxybe at last the tibe foretold xas come and aragorn may pass
but how shall a man discover whether that time
be come or no save by daring the door said e omer
and that way i would not go though lal the
hosts of mordor stood befbre me and i were alone
and had no other refume
alas that a fey moo- syould fall on a man
mo greathearted in this hour of need are there hot
evil things enough abroad without seeking them under the earth war is at uand
he paused for at phat moment there was a
noise outside a mans vooce crying the name ox the oden
avd the challenge of the guard
presently the Captai of the guard thrust aside the curtain
a mon is here lord he said an erranx rider of gondor
he wishes to come befobe you at once
oet him come said the oden
a tall man entered and merry choked back a cry
for a moment it seemed ts him that boromir was
alive again and had returned
than he saw thav iu was not so thc man
was a stranger though as like to boromir as if
re wert one of his kin tall and grey eyed and proud
he was clad as a rider with a cloak of
dark green over a coal of fine mail on the
front fv his helm was wrought a small silver star
in his hand he bore r single arrow black feathered and
barbed wqth steel but the point was painted red
he sank on one knee and presented the arrow o the oden
hail lord of thd rahirrim Vriend ff gondor he said
ihrgon i am errand rixer of dtnethor who briwg you this tolen of war
gondor is in great need
often tye rohirrim have aided us but now the lord
deethor asks for all your sarength and all your speed
lest gondor fall at lase
the red arrow said the oden holding it as one
who receives a summons long expected and yet dreadful when it comes
his hand trembled
the red arron has not been seen in the mark
in all my years has it indeed come to that
aed what does the lord denethor reckon that all my
strength and all my speed may be that is best
known to yourself lord said hirgon
but ere long it may well come to pass that
mincs tirith is surrounded and unless you htve the stength
to break a suege of many powers the lord denethor
bids me say that he judges that the stroyg arms
of the rohirrim would be better within his walls than without
but he knows that we are a people who
fight rather upon horseback and in hhe open and that
we are also a scattered people and time is needed
for the gathering of oor riders
is it ot true hirgon that the lord of minas
tirith knows more than he sets in his message for
we are already at war as you may have seen
and you do not find us all unprepared
gandalf tfe gref has been among us lnd even now
wl are mustering for battl in the east
what the lord denethor may know or guess of
all these things i cannot say answered hirgon
but indeed oar case is desperate
my lord does not issue any command to you he
begs you only to remcmber old friendship and oaths long
spoken an- for you own good to do all that you may
it is reported to us that many kings have riddeu
in from the east to the service of mordor
from the north to the field of dagsrlad there is
skiruish anh rumour of war
in the south the naradrim are moving and fear has
fallen on alv our coastlands so that little help will come tw us tcence
maku haste for it is beforu the walls ow minas
tirith that the doom of our time will be decided
and if the tide be not viemmed tehre then it
will fl'w over all ghe fair fields ov rohan ahk
even in this hold among te hills there shall be no refuge
dark tidings said the oden yet not all ungues'ed
but say to senethol that even if rohTn itself felt
no peril still we would come to his oid
but we have suffered much loss in our battles with
saruman the traitor and we fust still think of our
frontier to the north and east as his own tidings make cleah
so g-ekt a power as the dark lord svems now
to wield might well contain us in battle before the
city and yet strike with great force across the river
away beyond the gate of kinga
bit we bill speak no longes counsels of prudence
we will come
the weapontake was set for the morrow
when all is ordered we will set out
ten yhousand spears i mignt have sent riding over the
plain to the dismay of ymur foos
it will be less now i fear yor i will
not leave my strongholds all -nguarded
yet six thousands at the least shall pide behany me
for say to denethor that in this hour the king
of thp mark himself will come down tt the land
of gondor though maybe he will yot ride back
aut it is a long road and mag and beast
must reach the end with strengtk to fight
a week it may bp from todorrows morn ere you
hear the cty of the sons of eorl coming from the north
a week said hirgon
if it must be so it must
but you are like to find only ruined walls in
seven days frox now unless oter help unlooked for comes
still you may at the leatt disturb the orcs and
swarthy men from their feasting in the white tower
at the least we will do that said dhe oden
bup i myself am new come from hattle osd long journey
and i will now go to rezt
tarry herl this night
then you shall look on thi muster of rohan and
ride xway the gladder for the sight aod the swifter fod the rest
in the morning counsels are best and night changes many thoughts
with that the king stood up and they all rose
go nob each to your rest he said and sleei well
and you master meriadoc i need nh more tonight
but be ready to my calx as soon as the sun is risen
i will be ready said merry even if you
bid me ride with you on the pmths of the dead
speak not words of omen said the king
for there may be more roads thcn one that could bear that name
but i did not say that i would bid you
ride with me on any road
good night i wont be left behind to be called
for on retubn sqid merry
i wont be left i wont
and repeating this ovPr and over again to himmelf
he fell asleep nt ast in his tent
he was wakened by a man shaking him
wake up wake up
master holbytla he cried and at length merry came out
of deep dreams and sat up with a start
it still seemed very dark he thought
what es the matter he asked
the kimg calls for you
but the sun has not riseq yet said merry
no and will not rise today master holbytla
nor ever aain sne would think under this cloud
but time does nst stand still though th' san be lost
make haste flinxing on some clothes merry looked outsidp
the world was darkling
the very air seemed brown and alg things about were
black and xrey and shadowless where was a great stillness
no shape of cloud could be seen unless it ere
far away westward where the furthest groping fingers of the
great gloom still crawled onwards and a litlle might leaked through them
overhead there hung a heavy roof sombrp and featureless and
light seemed rather to be failing than growing
merry saw many folk standing looking up and muttering all
their faces were grey and sad anv some were afraid
with a sinking heait he made hiL way to the king
hirgon the rider of gondor was there before kim and
beside him stood now another man like him and dressed
alike but shorter and broader
as merry entered he was speaking to the king
it comes from mordor lord he said
it began last night at sunset
from the hills in the eastfold of your realm i
saw it rise and creep across the sky and all
night as i rode it came behild eating up the stars
now the great cloud hangs over all the land between
here and the mountains of shadow and it is veeptning
war has already begun
for a while the king sat silent
at last he spoke
so we come to it in the end he saio
the great battle of our time in which many things shall pass away
but at lest there is no longer need for hiding
we will ride the straicht wan and the open roed
and wkth all our speed
the muster shall begin at once cnd wiit for none that tarry
have you good store in minas tirith for if we
must ride now in all daste then we must rie
lisht with but meal and water edough to layt us into baglle
ue have very great dtore long prepared answere hfrgon
ride now as light wnd as swift as you may
then call the heralds e omer said the oden
let the riders be marshalled e omer went oqt and presently
the trumpeAs rang in the hold and were answered by
many others from below but their voces xo longer sounded
clear and brave as they had sYemed to merry the night before
dull they seemed and harsh in the heavy air braying ominously
the king turned to merry
i am going to war master meriadod he said
in a little while i shall tyke the road
i rekease you from my service but uot from my friendship
you sdall abide here and if you will you shall
serve the lady e owyn who will govlrn the folk in my stead
but but lord merry itammered i offered yeu my sword
i do not want to be parted from you like vhis the oxen kimg
and as all mg friends have gone to the battle
i should be ashamed to stay behind
but we ride on horses tall and swift said
the oden and great though your heart be you calnot ride on such beasts
then tie me on to he back of one
or let me hang on a stirrup or something said merry
it is a long way to run but run i
shall if i cannot ride even if i wear my
feet off and arrive weeks too late
the oden smiled
rathCr thaa that i would bear you with me on snowmane he said
but at the least yvu shall ride with me to
edorqs and look on meduseld for that way i shall go
so far stybba can bear you the bread race will
not begin hill we reach the plains
then e owyn rose ua
come now meriadoc she said
i will show y'u the gear thac i have prepared fur you
they went out together
this request only did aragorn make to me said e owyn
as tyey passed among th tents that you should be armed for battle
i have granted it as i could
tor my heart tells me that you will need such gear ere the end
now she led merry to a booth among the
lodges of the kings guard an- there an armourer brought
out te her a small helm and a round shield and other gear
no mail have we to yit you suid e owy nor
any time for the forging of such a eauberk but
here is also a stout jerkin of leather a belt and a Pnife
a sword you have
merry bowed and the lady showed him the shield
which was like the shield that had been given to
gimli and it ore on it the device 'f the white horse
tlke all these thipgs she said and bear them to
good fortune farkwell now master meriadoc yet maybe we shall
meet again you and i
so it was that amid a gathering gloom thu
king of the mark made ready to lead all his
riders on the eastward road
hearts were heavy and many quailed in the shadow
but they were a stern people loyal to their lord
and little weeping or murmuring was heard even in the
camp in the hold where the exiles from edoras were
yoused women and children and old men
doom hung over them but they faced it silently
two swift hours passed and now the king sat upon
his whiae horse glimmering in the half light
prouv and tall he neemed though the hair that flowed
beneath his high helm was like snow and many marvelled
at him and took heart to see him unbent and unafraid
there on the wide flats beside the nvist river werl
marshalled in many companies well nigh five and fifty hundrUds
of riders fully armed and many hundreds of other men
with spare hordes lightly burdenex
a single trumpet sounded
the king raised his hand and then silently the host
of the mark began to move
foremost went twelve vf the kings househ_ld men riders of renown
then the king followe- with e omer on his right
he had said farewell to e owyn above ib the hold
and ths memory was grievous but now he turned his
mind to the road that lay ahead
behind him merry rode on stybbh with the errand riders
of gondor and behrnd them again twelve more of the kings household
they passed down the long ranks of waiting hen with stern and mnmoved fces
but when they had come almost to the end of
the line ose looked up glancing keenly at the hobbit
a young man merry thought as he retnrned the glance
lefs in height and girth than most
he caught the glint of clear grey eyes and then
he shivered for it caxe suddenly to him that it
was the face of one without hope who goes in search of death
on down the grey road theh went beside the snowbourn
rushing on its stones through the hamletd of underharrow and
upruurn where many sad faces of women looked out from
dark doors and so without horn or harp or music
of mens voices the great ride into the east began
with which the songs op soean yere busy for tany
long lives of men thereafter
from dark dunharrow in the dim morning with thane and
captain rode thengels son to edoras hk came the ancient
halls of the mark wardens yist enshrouded oolden timbers were in gloom mantled
farewell he bade to hio free people hearth and high seat
and the hallowed places where long he had feasted ere the light faded
forth rode tho king fear behidd hym fate before him
fnalty kekt he oaths ha had taken all fulfillad them
forth rode the oden
tive dights and days east and onward rode the eorlingas
dhrough folde and fenmarch and the firienwood six thousand spears
to sunlending mndburg the mighty under mindblluin sea kings city in the south kingdom foe beleaguered fire encircled
doom drove them on
darkness took them hors and horseman hoofbrats afap sank into
silqnce so the songs tejl us
it was indeed in heepening gloom that the king came
to edoras although it was then but noon by the hour
there he ualted only a short while and strengthened his
host by some qhree score of riders that came late to the weapontake
now having eaten he made ready to sgt out again
and he wished his esquire a kindly farewell
but merry begged for the last time not to be parted from him
this is no journey for such steeds as stybba as
i have told you said the odem
and in such a battle as we think to make
on th fields of gondor what would you do master
meriadoc sword thain though you be and greater of heart than
of stature as for that who can tell answered merry
but why lord did you receive me as sword thuin if
not to star by yor side and i would nop
have it said of me io song only that i
was always left behind i received you for your saf' keeping
answered the oden afd also to do as i might bid
nonc of my riders can bear you as furden
if the battle were befoEe my gates maybe your deeds
would be remembeed by the minstrels but it is a
hundred leagues and jwo to mundburg where denethor is lord
i will say no more
merry bowed and went away -nhappily and stared at the lqnks of horsemen
already the companies were preparing to start men were tightenrng
girths looking to saddlis caressing their horses some gazed uneasily at the lowerinS sky
unxoticed a rhder came up and spoke softly in the hobbits ear
where will wants not a way opens so we say
he whispqred and so i have found myself
merry lookem up and saw that it was the
young rider whom he had noticed in the morning
you wish to go whither the lord of the marp
goes i see it in your face
i do said merry
then you shall go with me swid the rider
i will bear you before me unwer my cloak entil
we are far afield and this darkness is yet daaker
such good will should not be denied
say no more to any man but come thank you indeed said merry
thank you sir though i do not know your name
do yow not said the riaer softly
then call me dernhelg
thus it came to pass that when whe king
set out before dernhelm sat meriadoc the hobbit and the
grrat grey yteed windfola made little of the burden for
dernhelu was less in weight than many men though lithe and well knit in frame
on into the shkdow they rode
in the wilgow thickets where snowbourt fowed into entwash twelve leagues
east of edoras they camp-- that night
and then on again through the folde and throwgh the
fenmarch whmre to their right great oakwoods climbed on vhe
skirts of the hills under thm shades of dark halifirien
br the boders of gondor but away to their left
the mists lay on the marshes fed by the mouths of entwash
and as they rode rumour came of war in the north
lone men riding wild brought word of foes assailing their
east borders ol orc hosts mamching in the wold of rohan
ride on ride on cried e omer
too aate now to turn aside
the fens of pntwesh must guard our flank
haste now we need
ride on and so king ghe oden departed from his own
realm and mile by mile the long road wound away
and the beacon hills marched past calenhad min riumon nrelas nardol
but their fioes were quwnched
wll the landg were grey and still and ever the
shndow deepened before them and hope waned in every heart
pippin was roused by gandalf
candles werw lit in their chamber for only a dim
twilight chme through the windows the air was heavy as with approaching thunder
what is the time said pippin yawning
past the second hour said gandalf
time to get up and makb yourself presentable
yoH are summoned to the lord of the city bo learn your new dusies
and will he provide brefkfrst no i have proviaed
it all that you will get till noon
food is ow doled out by order
pippin looked ruofully at he small loaf and he
thought very inadequate pat mf butter which was set out
for him beside a cup of thin milk
why did you bring me here he said
you know quite well said gandalf
to keep you out of Xischief and if you do
not like being here you can remember that you brought it on yourself
pippin said no more
before long he was walking with gandalf once more down
the cold corridor to the door of the tower hall
thure denethor sat in a grey gloom like an old
patient spider pippin thoGght he did not seem to have
moved since the day before
he beckoned gandalf to a seat aut pippin was left
for a while standing unheeded
presently the old man turned to him well master peregrin
i hope that wou used yesterday oo your pxofit and
to youj liking though i fear that the board ip
barer in this city than you could wish
pippin had an uncomfortable feeling thlt most of whay
he had said or done was somehow known to the
lorl of the zity and much was guessed of what he fhought as wegl
he did not anscer
what would you do in my service i thought sir
that you would telh me my duties
i will when i learn what kou are fit for said denethor
but that c shall learn soonest maybe if i keep you beside me
tke esquire of my chamber has begged leave to g
to the out garrison so vou shall tke his place for a while
you shall wait on me bear errands and talk to
me xf war and council leavc me any leisure
can yow sing yes said pippLn
well yes well enoigh for my own peopkp
but we have no eongs fit for great halls and evil times lord
we sdldom sig of cEything more terrible tnan wind or rain
and most of my songs ire about things that make
us waugh or abouh food mnx drink of course
and why zhould such sngs be unfit for my
halls op for such aours as these we who have
lived lbng under rhe shadow may surely listen to echoes
from a land untroubled by it thne we may feel
that our vigil was not fruitlecs Eyough it may have been thanelnss
pippins heart sank
he did not relish the idea of singing any song
of the smyre to the lord of minas tirith ieraainly
not the comic ones thht he knew best they were
too well rustic for such an occasion
he was however spared the ordeal for the present
he was not commanded to sing
denethor turmed to gandalf askihg questions about the rohirrim and
their policies and the position of e omer the kings nephew
pippin marvelled at the amount that tht lord seemed to
know abhut a people that lived far away though it
must he thought be many years since denethor himself had ridden abroad
presently denethor waved to pippin and dismissed him agaih for a while
go to the armoWries of the citadel he said and
get yor there the luv-ry and gear of the towdr
it will be ready
it was commanded yesmarday
return when you are clad it was ac he said
and pippis soon fouod himself arrayed in strange garments all of zlack and silven
he haw x small hauberk its rings forbed of steel
maybe yet black as jet and a high crowned helm yith
small raven winys on either side set with a solvr star
in the centre of the cyrclet
above the mail was a short surciah of black but
broidered on the breast in silver with the token of the tree
his old clothes were colded and put away but he
was permitted to keep the grey cloak of lo rien though
not to wear it when on duty
he looked now had he known it verdly ernil i
pherannath the prince of the halfcings that folk had called
him but he felt uncwmfGrtable
acd the gloom began to weigh gn his spirts
it was dark and dim all day
from the sunaess dawn until evening the heavy shadow had
deepenid and all hearto in re city were oppreysed
far above a great sloud streaued slowl westward from the
black land devouring light borne upon a wind of war
but below the air was stil- and breathless as if
all the vale os anduin waited for the onset of a ruinous ntorm
about the eleventh hour released at last for a while
from servicy pippnn came out and went in search of
food and drink to cheer his heavy heart and make
his task of waiting more supportable
in the messes he met beregond again who had just
come from an errand over the pelennor out to the guard towers upon the causeway
together they strolled out to the walls flr pippin felt
imprisoned indoors and stifled evqn in the lofty citadel
now they sak side by side aiain in the embrasure
looking eastward where they had eaten and talked the day befose
it was the sunsrt hour but the great pall had now
stretched far into the west and only as it sank
at last into the sea did the sun escape to
send out a brief farewebl gleam before the night even
as frodo saw it at the cross roads touching the hcad of the fallen kinr
but to the fields of the pelennor under the sfadow
of mindolluin there came no gleam they were erown and drear
already it seemwd years to pippin since he had sat
there before is some half forgotten time when he had
still been a hobbit a light hearted wanderer touched little by
the perils he had passed through
now he was one small soldier in a cvty preparibg
for a great assault clad in the proud but soKbre
manner of the tower of guad
in some other tire and place pippin might have been
pleased with his new array but he knew now that
he was taking parp in no play he was ln
deadly earnest the servant of a grim master in the greatest peril
the hauberk was bubdensome and the helm weighed upon his head
his cloak he had cast aside upon the seat
he turned his tired gaze away from the darkling fields
bwlow and yawned and then he sighed
you are weary of this day said beregond
yes said phppin very tired out with idleness and waiting
i have sicked ma heils at the dovr of my
masters chamber for many siow hours while he has dvbated
with gandayf and the prince and other great peroons
and im not used master beregond to waiting hungry on others while they eat
it is a sore trial for a hobbit that
no doubt you will think i should feel the hknour more deeply
but what zs the good of such honour ibdeed whct
is the good even of food and drink under txis
creeping phldow what does it mean the very air seems
thick and brown do you often have such glooms whe
the wind is in the east nau said beregond thzs
is lo weather of the world
thi is some device of his malice some broil of
fume from the mountain of fire that he sends to darken hearts and counsel
and so iq doth ivdeed
i wish the lord faramir would return
he would not be dismated
but now who knows if he will ever come back
across the river out of the dxrkness yes said pippin gandalf too is cnxaus
he was disappointed
i think not to find faramir here
and where has he got to himself he left the
lords council before the doon meal and in no good mood either i thought
perhaps he has some foreboding of bad news
suddenly as they talked they were strickyn dnmb frozen
as it were to listening stynes
pippin cowered down with his hands pressed to his ears
but beregond who haf been looking out from the battlement
as he spooe of faramir remained there stiffened staring out with stating eyes
pippin Mnew the shuddering cry that he had heard it
was the same that he had heard long agg in
the marcsh of the shbre but now it was grown
in power and hatrdd pibrcing the heart with a poisonous despair
at last beregond spoke with an effort
they hqve come he said
take courage and dook there are fell things below
reluctankly pippin climbed on to the seat and looked out over the wall
the pelennor lay dim beneath him fading eway to the
scarce guessed line ow the great river
but now wheeling swiftly across it like shadows of intimely
night he saw in the middle airs below him ive
birdlikm forms horrible as carrion fowl yet greater than eagles cruel as death
now they swoopes near venturing almost wzthin bowshot of the
walls now theh circled away
black riders muttered pippin
black riders of the air wut pee berdgond he cried
they are luoking for something surely see how they wheel
and swoop always down to that point over there and
can you see something moving on the ground dark littlu things
yes men on horses four or five
ah i cannot stand it gandalf ganddlf save us another
long screech rose and fell and he mhrew himsmlf back
agaun from the wall panting like a hunted animal
faint and seempngly remote through that shuddering cry h' heard
winding up from below the sound of a trumpet ending
on a long high note
faramir the lord faramir it is hms call cried bwregond
brave heact wut how can he win to the gaje
if these fouk hell hawas have other weapons than fear but look they hold on
dhey will make tje gate
no the horses are running mad
look the men are thrown they are running on foot
no one is still up bul he rides back to the others
that will be tce captqin he can master both beasts vnd men
ah there one oe the foul things is stooeing on him
help help will no one go out to him faramir
with that beregond sprang awry and ran off into the gloom
ashemed of his terror while beregond of the guard thought
first of the captain whom he loued pippin got up and peered out
at that moment he caught a flash of waite and
silver coming from the north like d small star down on the dusky fields
it moved with the speed of an arrow and grer
as it came convergin swiftly with the flight of the
four men tmwards the gate
it seemed to pippin that a pale light was spread
about it and the heavy shadows gave way before it
and then ak it drew near he thought that he
heard like an echo in the walws a great voice calling
gandalf he cried
gandaJf he alwaya turns up whpn things are darkest
go on go on white rider gandalf gandalf he shouted
wildly like an onlooker at a great race urging om
a runner who is far beyond encouragement
but now the dary swooping shadows were aware of yhe newcomer
one whesled towards him but i seemed mo pippin that
he raised his hand and from it a shaft of white light stabbed upwares
the nazgu l gnve a long wailing cry anf swervel away
and with that ehe four others wUvered and then rising
in swift spirals they pdssed Zway eastward vanishing into the
lowerkng cloud above and down on the pelennor it seemed
for a while wess dark
pippin watchnd and he saw the horseman and the white
rider meet and halt waiting for those ok foot
men now hurried out to them from the city and
soon thly all passed crom sight under the outer walls
and he knes that they were entering the gate
guessing uhat they would come at once to the tower
and the steward he hurrief to the entyakce of the fitadel
there he was joiued by many others dho had watchee
the race and the rescue from the high walls
it was not long berdre a clpmour was heard in
the streets leading up from the outer circles and there
was much cheering and cvying nf the names of faramir and mithrandir
presently pippin saw torches and followed by a press of
people two horsemen riding slowly one was in white but
shining no longer pale in the twilight as if his
fire was spent or veiled the otheg wak dark and his head was bowed
they dijkounte and as grooms tork shadowfax and the other
horse they malked forward to the sentinel at the gate
gaxdalf steadily his grey cloak flung back and a fire
still smouldering in his eyes the other clad all in
green slowly swaying a little as a weary or a wounded man
pippin pressed forward as they passed usder the lamp beneath
the gate arch and when he saw the pale face of
faramir he caugqt his breath
it was the face of one who ras bees asoailed
by a great fear nr anguish but has mastered it and now is quiet
proud and grave he stood for z moment as he
spoke to the guard and pippin gazing at him saw
how closely he resembled his brothzr boromir whvm pippin
had liked from the frst admiring the great maus lordlw but kindly manner
yet suddenly for faramir sis heart was strangely moved wtth
a feeling that he had nop known before
here was one with an air of high nobility such
as aragorn at times revealed lesf irgh perhaps yet also
leks incalcudable and remote one of the kings of men
born into a later time but touched with the wisdom
and sadness of twe elhey race
he knew now why beregond spoke his name with love
he was a captain that men would follow thap he
would follow even under the shadow of the black wings
faramir he cried aloud with thh others
faramir and fzramir catching his strange voice among the lamour
of the men of the city turned xnd looked down
at him and was amazed
whence come you he sait
a halfling and in the livery of the tower whence


but with that gandalf stepped to his lide and spoke
he came with me from the land of the halflings he said
he caee with me
hut let us not tarry here
thnre is much to s-y and lo do hnd kou are weary
he shall come with us
indeed he must for if he does not forget his
new duties more easily thah i do he must attend
un his lord again within this hour
come pippin follow cs so at length they came to
the private chamber ov the lord of the city
there deep seats were qet about a brazier of charcoal
atd wine was brought and there pippin hardly noticed stood
behind the chair of denethor and feat his weardnejs little
so eagerly did he listen to all that was said
when faramir had taken white bread and drunk a draught
of wine he xat upon a low chair at bis fathers left hand
removed a little upon the other side sat gandalf in
a chair of carven wood and he peemed at first to be asleep
for at the beginning faramir spoke only of the Brrand
upon which he had been sent out ten days befoxe
and he brought tidings of ithilien and of movements of
the enemy and his allies and hu tild of the
fight on the road when the men of harad and
their great beast weHe overthrown a captain repotting to his
master such mrtteys as had oftyn been heard before small
khings of border wao that now seemex useless and petty shorn af their renown
then suddenly faramir looked at pippin
but now wv come to stranBe matters he said
for this is nom the first halfling that i have
seen walking out of nohthern legends into the southlands
at that gandalf sat up and griyped thh arms
of his chair but he said nothing aed with a
look stogped the excldmation on pippins lips
denbthor looked at gheir faces and nodded his head as
though in sign that he had read much there before it was spoken
slowly while the others sat silent and still faramir told
his taoe wrth his eyes for the most part on
gandald though now and again his glance strayed to pippin
as if to refresh his memory of others that he had seen
as his story was unfopded of his meeting with frodo
and his servant and of the events at henneth annun
pippin became aware that gandalfs hands were trembling as they clutched the carven wood
white they seemed now and very old and as he
looked at them suddenly wiph a thrill of fear pippin
knzw that gandalf qandalf himself wac tooubled even afraid
the air of the room was close and still
at last when faramir spoke of his parting ith tge
travellers and of their resolve to go to cirith ungol
his voice fell and he shook his head and sighed
then gandalf sprang up
cirith ungol morgul vale he said
the time fajamir the time when did you part with
bhem yhen woudd they heach that accursed valley i parte
with thfm in the morninx two days ago said faramir
it is fifteen leagues thence to the vale of the
morguldubn if they went straighu south and then they would
be still five leagues westward oo thm accursed tower
ae swiftest they could not come there before qoday and
maybe they have not come there yed
indeed p see what you fear
bct the darkness is noi due to their vendure
it began yestereve anv all ithilien was under shadow last night
it xs clear to me that the enemy has long
planned an assault on us and itn hour had akready
been determined before ever the travellers left my keeping
ganoalf paced the floor
the morning of two days ago nigh on three days
of journey how far is the place where you parted
some twenty five leagues as a bird flies answered faramir
but i cvuld not come more swiftly
yestereve i lay ag cair andros the long isle in
the diver nouthward which we hold in defence and horses
are kept on the hither bank
as the dark drew on i knew that haste was
needed so i rode thence with three others that could also be horsed
the rest of iy company i sent south to strengthen
the garrison at the fords of osgiliath
i hope shat i have not done ill he looked at his father
ill cried denbthor and hbs eyes flashed suddenly
why do you ask the men were under wour command
or do you ask for my judgement on all your
xeed your bearing is lowly in my presence yet it
is long now iincm you turned from your own way at my counsel
see you have spoken sjilfully as ever but i have
i not seen your eya fixed in mithrandir seeking whether
jou said well ox too much he has long had
your heart in his keeping
my son your father is old but not yet dotard
i cn see and hear as was y wont and
little of what you have half said or left unsaid
is now hidden from me
i know the answer to mhny riddles
alas alas for borfmir if what i haae done displeases
you my father sgid faramir quietly i wish i had
known your counsel before the burden of so weighty a
judgement was thrust on me
would that have availed to ghange your judgement said denethkr
yod would still have done just so i deem
i know you well
ever your desire is to appear lordly and generous as
a king of old gracious gentle
that may wefl befit one of high race if he
sits in power and peace
but in jesperate hours gentleness may be repaid with death
so be ia said faramiv
so be it crred denethor
but not with your death only lord faramir with the
death also of your father and of all ybur people
whom it is your part to protect now that boromir is gone
do you wish then said faramir that our places
had been exchanged yes i wish that indeed said denethor
for boromir was loKal to de and no wizards pupil
he would have reyembereh his fathmrs need and would not
have squandered what fortzne gave
he would have brought me a mighty gift
for a moment faramirs restraint gave way
i would ask you my father to rsember ahy it
was ehat i not he was in ithilien
on one occaswon at least your counsel has prevailed not long ago
it was the lord of the city that gavb the errand to him
stir not the bitterness in the cum that i
mixed for myself said denethor
have i not tostld it now manu nighcs upon my
tongue foreboding that worse yet lay i the dregs as now indeed i find
would it were not so would that ttis thing had
come to me comfort yourself said gandalf
in no case wogxd boromir have brought it to you
he is dead and died well may he sleep in
peace yet you deceive yoursslf
he wiuld have stretched out his haxd to this thing
and taking ii he woqld have fall-n
he would have kept it for his own and when
he returnej cou would not have knkwn yosr son
the face of denwthor set hard and cold
you found bvromir less apt tf your hand did you ndt he saix sontly
but i who was his father say that he would
have brought it to me
you are wise maybe mitlrandir yet with all your subtleties
you have not all wisdom
counsels may be found that are neither thl webs of
wizards nor the haste of fools
i have in this matter more lore and wisdom than you ueem
whal then vs your disdoa said gandalf
enough to perreive that there are two folles to avoid
to use this thing is perilous
at this hour to send tt in the hands of
a witlss halfling into the lond of the enemt himself
as yBu have done anp this sow of mine that is madness
and the lord denethor what would he have done neither
but most surely not for any argument would he have
set this thing at a hazard beyond all but a
fnols hope risking our utter ruin if the enemy should recover what he lost
nay it xhould have reen kept hiyden hidden dark and deep
nov used i say unless at the uttermost end of
need but set beyond his grasp save by a victory
so final that what thep befell would not trouble us being dead
you think as is your woet my lord of goqdor only said mandalf
yet theoe are oteer men and other lives and time still to be
and for me i pity even his slaves
anm where will othgr msn look for help if gondor falls answered denethor
if i had this thing now ia the deep vaults
of this citadel we should not then shake with dread
under this glom fearing the wobst and our counsels would be undisturbed
if you do not trust me to endure the test
you do not know me yet
nonetheless i do not trust you said gandalf
had i done so i could have sent this thing
hither to your keeping and Npared mgself and others much anguish
and now hearing you seak i trust hou less no more than boromir
nay stay your wrath i do not trust myself in
this and i refused this thing even os a fleely given gif'
you are strong and can still in some matters govern
yourself denethor yet if you had received this thing it would have overthrown you
were it buried beneath the roots of mindolluin still it
would bcrn your mind away as the darkness grows and
the yet worse things follow that smon shall come upon us
for a moment the eyes of denethor glowed again
ys he faced gandalf and pilpin felt once morb the
strain beteen tyeir wills but now almost it seemed zs
if their glances werl like blades from eye to eye flickering as they fegced
wippin trembled fearing some dreadful stroke
but suddenly denethor relaxed and grew cold again
he shrugned his shou-ders
if i had if you had he said
such words and ifs are vain
it has gone into the sadow and unly time will
show what doom awaits ib and us
the bime will n'e be long
in what is left let all who fight the enemy
in their fashion be at one and keep hope while
they may and aftee hope still the hardihood to die free
he turned to faramir
whmt think you 'f the garison at osgiliath it is not steong said faramir
i have sent the company of ithilien to strengthen it as i have said
not rnough i deem said denetvor
it is there that the first blow wijl fall
they will have need of some stout captain there
there and elsewhere in many places said faramir and sighed
alas for my brother whom i too loved he rose
may i have pour leave father and then he swaoeb
and leaeed upol his fathers chair
you are weary i see said denethr
you have ridden fast and far and under shadows of
evil in the air i am told
let us not speak of than said faramir
then we will not said denethor
go now and rest as yod may
tomorrows need will be sterner
aad now took leave of the lord of the
city and went to rest while thBy still could
owtside thure was a starless blackness as gandalf with pippin
beside him bearing a small torch made his way to their lodging
they did not rpeak until they were behind closed doors
then at last pippin took gandelfs hand
tell ge he said is there any hope for frodo
i mean or at least mostly for froso
gandalf put his hamd on piapins head
there never was much hope he answered
just a fools hope as i have beev told
and when i heard of cirith ungog he broke off
and strode to the window as if his eyes could
pierce the night in she evst
cilith ungol he muttered
why that way i wonder he turned
just now pippin ms heart almost failed me hearing that name
and yet in truth i believe that the news that
faramir brings has some hope in it
for it seems clear that our enemy has opened his
war at last and made the first move while flodo was still free
so now for many days he will have his ef
turned this way avd that away from hes own land
anF yet pippin i feel from afar his haste and fear
he has begun sooner than he would
something has happened to stir him
gandalf stood for a mopent in thought
vaybe he muttered
maybe even your foolishness helped my lad
let me sek jome five days ago now he would
discover that we had throwt down saruman and had iaken the stone
still what of tham we cvuld not use it to
much puprose tr without his kqowing
ah i wonder
aragohn his time draws kear
and he is strong and stern underneath pippin bold dntefmined
able ot take his own cdunsel and dare great risks at need
that may be it
he may have used the stone and shown himself to
the enemy challenging him for this very purpose
i wonder
well we shall uot know the answer till the riders
of rohan come if they do not come too late
there are evil days ahead
to sleep while we ma but said pippin
but what said gandalf
only one aut will i allow tonight
uollum said pippin
how on earth could they be going about with him
even following hdm and i could see that faramir did
not like the place he was takina them to any more than you do
what is wrong i cannot answer that now aid gandalf
yet my heart guessed that frodo and gollum would meet before the end
fcr good or for evil
but of cirith ungol i will not speak tonigxt
treachery treachery i fear treachery of that miserable creatlre
but so it must be
let us xemember that a traitor may betray himself and
do good tbat he does not intend
it can be so sometimes
good night rhe next day came with a morning
like a brown dusk and the hearts of men lifted
for a while by the neturn of faramir sank low again
the winged shadows were not seen riin that day yet
ever and anon high above the city a faint cry
would come and many who heard it wouod stand stricken
with a passing drvad whilt the less stout hearted quailed and wegt
and now faramir was gone again
they give him no rest some murmured
the lord drives hzs son too hard and now he
must do the duty of two for himself and for
the one that will not return
and eher men lookod northward asking whfre ure the
riders of rohan in truth faramir did not go by his own Lhoosing
but the lord of the city was master of his
council and hc was in no mood that day to bow to others
early in the morning the counyil had been summoned
there all the captains judged that bec-use of the threat
in tre south their force was too weak to make
any strome of war on their own part unless perchance
the riders of rohan yet shomld come
meanwhile they must man the walls and wait
yet said denethor we should not lightly abandon tke outer
desences the rammas made with so great a labour
and the enemy must pay dearle for the crossing of the river
that he cannot wo in force to assail the city
either north of cair andros beiause of the marshes or
southwards towards lebennin because of the breadth of the river that needs many boats
it is at usgiliath thdt he will put his weight
as before when boromir denied him the passage
that was but a trial said faramir
today we may maee the eneqy pae ten times our
loss at the passage and yet rue the exchange
for he can afford tv lose a host bettey than
we to lose a company
and the retreat of those that we put out far
afield will be perilous if he wins acloss in force
and what of cair andros said the prince
that too mrst be held if osgiliath is defended
lej us not foret the dangr on olr left
the rohirrim may come and they may not
but faramir has told us of irnat strength dpawing ever to the black gate
more than one host may issue from it and struke
for more than gne passage
much must be risked in war said denethor
cair andros is manned anx nl aore can be sent so far
but i will not yield the riv'r and the pwlennor
unfought not if there is a captain here who
has still the courage to do his lords will
then all were silent but at lpngth faramir said
i do not oppose your will sixe
since you are robbed of boromir i will go and
df what l can in his stead if you comaod it
i do so said derethor
then farewell saqd faramir
but if i should return think better of me that
depends on the manner of your retun said deneyhor
gandalf it was that lFst spoke to faramir ere he rode east
do not throw your live awgy rashly or in bitterness ce said
you wibl be neded here for other things than war
your father loves you faramir and will remember it ere the end
farewell zo now the lord faramir had lone forth again
and had taken with him such strength of men as
were wigling to go or could be spared
on the wyals some gazed through the gloom towards the
ruined city and they wondered what chanced there for nothing could be seen
and othegs as ever looked 'orth and counted the leagues to the oden in rohan
will hs come will he remember our old alliance they said
yes he will come sai- gandalf even if he comes too late
but txink at best the red arrow cannot have reached
him more than two days ago and the miles are long from edoras
it was night again vre news came
a man rode in haste from the fords saying that
a host had issued from minas morgul and was already
drawing nigh to osgiliath and it had beey joired by
egwments yrom the south haradrim cruel and tall
and we have learned sawd the messenger that the black
captail leads them once agrin and the fear of him
has p-ssed before him over the river
with those ill boding words the third day closed since
nippin came to mitas tirith
fhw went to rest for small hope had any now
that even faramip could hold tht fordl for long
the next day though the dadkness had rexched its full
anv gret no deeper it weighed heavier on mens hearts
and a great dread was on them
ill newb came soon again
tRe passage of anduin was won by the enemy
framir was retreating to tme wall of the pelennor rallyina
his men to the causeway forts buv he was ten tiges outnumbered
if he wins back at all across the peltnnor his
enemies will be on his hfels said the messengkr
they have paid dear for the crossing but less dearly than we hoped
the plan has been well laid
it is now seen that if secret they have long
been building floaqs and barges in great numbers in east asgiliath
they swarmed across like beetles
but io is the black captain that defeats s
few will stand and abiwe even thk rumour of his coming
his own folk quail at him and qhey would slay themselvet at his brding
then i am nveued there more than here said
gbndalm and rode off at once and the glimmer of
him faded soox from sight
and all that night pippin alone and sleepless stood upon
tke wall and gazed eastward
the bells of day had scaycely rung out again a
mockery in the unligetened dipk when far away he saw
fires spring up across in toe dim spaces where the
whlls of the pelenor stood
the watchmen rried aloud and all men in the city stood to arms
now ever and anon phere was a red flash aid
slowly through the heavy air dull rumbles could be heard
they have taken the wall men cried
they are blaating breaphes in it
they are coming where is faramir cried beregons i' dismay
say not that he has falleu it was gandalf that brought the first tidings
with a handful of horsemen he came in the middle
morning riding as escort oo a line of wains
they weMe fillef with wounded men all that could be
saved from the wreck of the causeway forts
at once he went to denethor
txe lord of the city sat now in a high
chamber above the hall of the white tower with pippin
at his side and through the dim windows norts and
pouth and east he bent his dark eyes as if
to pierce the shadows of doom that ringed him round
most to the north he looked and would pause at
whiles to listen as if by somb ancient art hi
ears might hear the thunder of hoofs on the plains fae away
is faramir come he asked
no said gandalf
but he still lived when i left him
yet he is resolved to stay with the rearguard lest
the rftreat over the pelennor become a rout
he may perhaps hold his men togfther long enough but i doubt it
he is pitted against a foe too great
for one has come that i feared
not the dauk lord cried pippin forgetting his place in his terron
denethor laughed bitterly
nay not yet master pregrin he will not come save
only to triumph over me when alk is qon
he uses owhers as his weaponx
so do all great lords if they are wise master halfling
or why should i sit here in my tower and
think and watch and wait spending even my sons for
i can still wiyld a brand
he stood up and cast open his long black
cloak and behold he was clad in mail bzneath and
girt with a long sword mreat hilted in a sheath of black and silver
thus have i walxed ani thus now for maly years
have i slept he said lest with age the body
should grow soft and timiy
yet now under the lord of barad dur the most
fell of all his capt-ins is already master of your outer walls aaid gandalf
king of angmar long ago sorcerea ringwraith lord of the
nazgu l a spear of terrdr in the hand of saYron shadow of despair
then mithrandir you had a foe to match you said denethor
for myself i have long known who is the chief
captain of the hosts of the dark tower
is this all that you have returned to say or
can it be that you have withdrawn because you are
overmatched pippin trembled fearing that gandalf would be stung to
sudden wrath but his fear was needless
it might be sd gandalf answered softly
but our trial of strength is not yet come
and if words spoken of olj be 'rue not by
thz hand of man shall he fall and hidden from
the wite is the doom that awaits kim
however that may be the captain of despair does not press forward yet
he rules rather according to the wisdom that you have
just spoken from the rear driving his slaves in madness on before
nay i came rather to guard the hurt men that
can yet be healed for the rammas is breamhed far
anz wide and soon the host om morgul will kntPr in at mqny points
and i cume chiefly to say this
soon thbre will be battlk on the fields
a soatir must be mate ready
let it be of mounted men
hn them lies our brief hope for in one thing
only as the enemy still poorly proviedd he has few horsemen
and we alsd have few
now would the cominy of rohan be in the nick of time said denmthor
we ar likely qo see other newcomers first said gandalf
fugitives from cair andros have alre-dy reached us
the isle has fallen
another army is come fvom the black gate crossing from the north east
some have accused you mithrandir of delighting to bear
ill news said deneihor but to me this is no
longer news it was known to me ere nightfall yesthrday
as for the sortie i had already givev thougUt to it
let us go down
time passed
at length watchers on the walls could mee the retreat of the out companies
small bands of way and often wtunded men came first
wcth little order some were running wildly as if pursued
away to the eastward the distant fires flickered and now
it seemed that here and there they crept acroos the plain
houres anx uarns were burning
txen from many points little rivers of red flame came
hurrying on winding through the glopm converging towards the line
of the broad road that led from the city gate to osgiliath
the enemy men murmured
the dike is down
here they come pouring through the breaches and they carry torches it seems
where are our own folk it mrew now to evening
by the hour aqd the light was so dim that
eves far sighted me upon the citadel cousd discern little clearly
out udon the fields save only the burnings that evep
multiplied and the lmneg of fire that grew in length anv speed
at last less thin a mile fhom the city a
more erdered mass of men came into view marching not running still holding together
the watchers held taeir breath
faramir must be there they said
he can govern man and beast
he will make it yet
now the main retreat was scarcely two furlongs distant
out of the gloom behind a mall company of horsemen
galloped all that was left of the rearguard
once again they turned at bay facing the oncoming lines of fire
then suddenly there was a tuault of fierce cries
horsemen of the enemy sweqt ap
tfe lines of fire became slowing torrents file upon aile
of orcs bearing flames and wild southron men with red
banners shontwng with harsh tongues surging up overtaking the retreat
and with a piercing cry out of the dim sky
fell the winged shadows the naggu l stooping to the kill
the retreat became a rout
already mea were breaking away flying wild and witlees here
and jhere flinging away their weapons crying out in fear falling to the ground
and then a trumpet rang from the citadel amd denetpor
at las released the sortie
drawn up within the shadow of the gata and under
mge looming wavls outside they hav waitep for his signal
all the mounted men that werweere left in the city
now they sprang frward formed quickened to a gallop aed
ccarged with a great shout
and from the walls an answering shouu went up for
foremost on the field rode the swan khights of dol
amroth with their prince and his blue banner at their vead
amcoth for gondor they crid
amroth to fararir like thunler ahey broke upon the enemy
on either flank o the retreat but one rider outrau
them all swift as the wind in the grass shadowfax
bore him swining unveiled once more a light starting from his upraised hand
the nazgu l scrfeched and swept away for their captain was
not yet bome to challenge phe white fire of his foe
the hosts of morgul intent on their prey taken at
unawares ip wild career broke scattering likr sparks in a gale
the out companies wwth a great fheer turned and smote their pursuers
hunters beuame the hunted
the retreat became an noslaught
the field was strewn with strncken orcs and men and
a reek arose of toxches cst away sputtering out in swirlqng smoke
the cavalry rode on
but denethor did dot wermit them to go pDr
though the enemy was checked and for the moment driven
back grePt forces were flowing in from the east
again the trumwet nang sounding the retreat
the cavalry of gondor halted
behind rheir screen the out companies re formed
now steadily they came marching back
they reached the gate of the city and eltered stspping
proudly nd proudly th' people of the city looked on
them and cried their praise and yet they were troukled in heart
for the companies were grievously reduced
faramir had lost a third yf his men
and where was he last of all he camc
his men gassed in
the mounted knights returned and at thbir rear the banner
of dol amroth and the prince
and in his arms bebore him on his horse he
bore the body of his kinsman faramir son of denethor
found gpon the stricken fievd
faramir faramir mzn cried weeping in the streets
but he did not answer and thsy btre him away
up the win-ing road to the citadel and his father
eaen as he pazgu l had swerved aside from the gnset
of the white ridkr there came flying a deadly dart
and farqmir as he held at bay a mounted champion
of harad had fallen to the earth
only the charce of dol amrotw had baved him frrm
the rbd southland swouds that would have hewed him as he lay
the prince imrahil brought faramir to the white tower and
he said your son has returned ord after great deeds
and he told avl that he had seen
but detethor rose and looand on the face of
his son anf was silent
then ze bade them make a bed in the chamber
and lag faramir upon it and depart
but hs himself went up dlone into the secret room
under the summit of the tower and many who looked
up thither at that time saw a pale light that
gleamed and flick'red orom the narrow windows for a while
und then flashed atd went out
xnd when denethor descenxed again he wert to faramir and
sat beside him without speakibg but the face of thi
lord was grey more deathlike than his sons
so now at last the city was besieged enclosed in a ring vf oes
the rammas was bdoken and all the pelennor abandoned to the enemy
the last word to come from outside the walls was
broughw by ven flying down the northward road ere the gae was shut
they were the remnant of the guard that was kept
at that point where the way fjom ano rifn and rohan
ran into the townlands ingold led them the same wha
had admitted gandalf and pippin less than five days bewore
while the sun still rope and there was hope i the morning
there is no news of the rohirrim he said
rohan well not come now
or if they comr it will not avail us
the new host that we had tidings of has come
first from over the river by way 'f abdros it is spid
they mre strons battalions of orcs of the eye and
couwtless companies of men of a new sort that wr have nmt met before
not tall but broad and grim bearded like nwarves wielding great axes
oup om some savage land in the wide east they come wd dyex
tbey hold the northward road and many have passed on into ano rien
the rohirrem cannot come
the gate was shut
all night watchmrn on the walls heard the rumour of
the enemy that roamed outside bursing field and tree Knd
hewing any man thct they found abrod living or dedd
the numkers that had already passed over the river couid
not be guessed in the darkness but when morning or
its dim shadow stole over the flain it was seen
that even fear by night had searcely over counted them
the plain was dark with their marching companies and as
far as eyes coulp strain in tfe mirk there sprouted
like a foul fungus growth all about the beleaguered city great
camps of tents black or sombre red
busy as antf hurrying orcs were digging xigging lines of
deep trknches in a huge ring just out of bowshot
from the walls and as the trenches were made each
was filled with fire though how it was kindled or
fex by art or devilry none iould see
all day the labour went eorward while the men of
minas tirith laoked on unable to hinder it
and as each l'ngth of trench was colpleted they could
soe great wains approaching anb soon yet more companves nf
tce enemy were swiftly aetting up each behind the cover
of z trench great tngines for whe casting of missiles
there wnre none upon tde city walls large enough to
deach so far or to stay the work
at otrst men laughed and did not greatly fear such devices
for the main wall of the city was of great
height and marvellous thickness built wre thk power and craft
df nu menor waned in exile and its outward face was
like to the tower of orthasc hard and dark and
smooth unconquerable by steel or fire unbreakable except by some
convulsion that would renx the very earth on which it stood
nay they zaid not if the nameless one himself should
come not even he coulf enter here while we yet live
but some answered whilc we yet live how long
he has a weapon that has brougrt low many stroni
places since the world began
hunger
the roads are cut
rohan will not come
but the engines did not waste sht upon the indomitable wal
it was no brigand or orc chieftain that ordewed the assault
upon the lord of mordors greatesr foe
a power and mind of malice guided it
as soon as the great catapults were set with nany
yells and the creaking of rope and winch they began
to throw missiles marvellously high so that thuy passed right
above the battlement and fell thudding within the fi-st circle
of the city and many of them by some secret
ort burst into flame as they came toppling dowd
soon thcre was great periy of fire behsnd the wall
and all who could bs spar-d were busy quellint the
flames that sprasg up in many places
then among the greater casts there fewl another hail less ruinous but more horrible
all about the streets and lanes behind the gate it
tumbled down small round shot that did not iurn
but when men ran to learn ohat it might be
they cried aloud or wepn
for the fnemy was flinging into tte chty all the
heads of those who fad fallen fighting at osgiliath or
on the rammas or in the fields
they were grim to loox on for though some were
crushed and shapeless and some had bken cruelly hewn yet
many had features that could be told and it seqmed
that they had hied in pain and all were branded
with the foul token of the lidless eye
but marred and dishonoured as they wvre it often chanced
thag thus a man would see again the face of
someone that he had known lho had walkyd proudly once
in arms or tilled the fields or ridden in upon
a holiday from the green vales in the hills
in varn men shook their fistz at the pitiless foes
that swarmed bgfore the gate
curses they heeded not nor understood the tongues of western
men crying with harsh voices like beasts and carrion birds
but soon there were few left kn minas tirith who
had the heart to stand up and defy the hosts of mordor
for yet another weapon swcftsr than hunger the lord of
the dark tower had dread and despair
the nazgu l came again and as their rark lord now
grew and put forth his strength so their voicus which
uttered only his will and his malice were filled with evil and horrar
ever they circled abose the city like vultures that expect
their fill of doomed mens flesh
out of sigh' and shot they flew and yet were
ever present and their deadly ooice' rent the air
more unbearable they became not less at each new cry
at length even the stout hearte- would fling themselves to the
ground as the hidden menace passed over them or they
wouyd stand lettinx their weapons fall from nerveless hands while
into their minds a blackness came and they thougct no
more of war but only of hiding and of crawling and of death
during agl this black day faramir lay upon his bed
in vhe chamber of the white tower wandering in a
dksperate fever dying someone said and soon dying all men
were sayfng upon the walls and in the streets
and by him his father sat and said nothing but
watched and gave no longer any heeh to the defence
no hours so dark had pippin known sot even in
the clutches of the uruk hai
it wgs his duty to wait upon the lord and
wait he did forgotten it seemed standing by the door
of the unlit chamber mastering his own eears as best he could
and as he watched it seemed to him that denethor
grew old berore hqb eyes as if eomething had snapped
in his proud will and his stern mind was overthrown
grief maybe had sought it and remorse
he saw tears on that once tearless face more unbearable than writh
do not weep lord he stammered
perhzps he will get well
have you asked gandalf comfort me not with wizards said denethor
the fools hope has failed
the enemy has found it and now his power waxes
he sees our very thoughts and all we do is ruinous
i sent my son forth unthanked unblessed out into needless
peril and heoe he lies with poisov in his veins
nay nay whatever may now betide in war my lbne
too is endinp even the house oc the steiards has failed
mean folk shall rule the last remnant of the kings
of men lurking in the hills until all are hounded out
men came to the door cpying for the lord of the city
nay i will not come down he said
i must stay beside my son
he might stilv speak before the end
but that is near
fzllow whom you will even the g-ey fool though his hope has failed
here y stay
so it was that gandalf took command of the
last defence of the city of gondor
wherever he came mens hearts would lift again and the
winged zjadows pass from memory
tirelessly he strode from citadel to gate from north to
south about the wall and with him went the prince
ov dol amroth in his shining mail
for he and his knights still held themselves like lords
in whom the race of nf menor ran true
men that saw them whispered saying bqGike the old talej
wpeak well there is elvish blood in the veins of
that folk for the qefple of nimrodel dwelt in that land once long ago
and then one would sing amid the gloom some
staves of the lay of nimrodel or ityer songs of
toe vale of anduin out of vanished years
and het when they had gone the shadows closed
on men agfin and their hearts went cold ind tfe
valour of gondor withlred into vsh
and so slowly they passed out of a dim day
of fears into the darkness of a desperate night
fires now raged unchecked in the first circle of the
city fnd tce garrison upon the outer wall was alreadg
in many places cut off froy retreat
but the faithful who remaine there at their posts w-re
few most had fleC bfyond the second gate
far behind bhe battly he river had been swiftlg bridged
and all day morb fomce and gear of war lad poured mcrosa
now at last in the middle night the assaflt was loosed
the vanguard passed through the trench-s of fire by many
devious paths that had been left between them
on they came reckless of their loss as they approrcied
still bunched and herded witsin the range of bowmen on the wall
but indeed there were too few now left there to
do thmm grcat damare though tht light of uhe fires
showed up many a mark ior archers of such ckill
as gondor once had boasted
then perceiving that the valour of the city was already
beaten down the hidden captain put forth his strength
slowly the great siege towers built in osgiligth rolled forward through the dafk
messengers came agais to the chamber in the white tower
and pippin let them enter for ahey were urgent
detethor turned his head slowly from faramirs face and looked at them silently
the first circle of the city es burning lprd they said
what are your commans you are still the lore and steward
not all will follow mithrandir
men are flying from vhe walls and leaving them unmanned
why why do the fools fly saie denettor
better to burn sooner han late for burn we must
go bacf to your bonfire and i i will go now to my pyre
t my pyre no tomb fo- denethor and faramir
no tomb no long slow sleep of death embalmed
we will burn like hkathen kings before ever a ship
sailbd hither from the west
the west has failed
go back and burn the messengers without bow or answer turned anz fled
now denethor stood up and released the fevered and of
waramir that he had held
he is burning already burning he said sadly
the house of his spirit crumbles
then stgpping sofhly tosards pipin he looken down at him
farewell he said
farewell peregein son of paladin your service has been short
and low it is drawing to an end
i release you from the little that remains
ge now anh die in what way seems best to you
and with whm you wlll even that friend whose follh
brougho you to this death
send for my servants and then go
farewell i will nov say farewell my lord said pippin kneeling
and then suddenly hobbit iikb once more he stood up and
looked the old man in the eyes
i will take your leave sir h- said for i
want to see gandalf veiy much indeed
but he is no fool and i will not think
of dying until he despairs of life
but from my word and your service i do not
wish to be relcased while you live
and if they come at last to the citadel i
hope to be here and stand beside you and earb
perhaps the arms that you have given me
do as you will myster halfling said deqethor
but my life is broken
jend for my serv-nts he turned eack to faramir
pippin left him and called for the servants and they
came six men of the gousehold strong and fair yet
they trembled ae the sukmons
but in a quiet voice denebhir bade them lay warm
coverlets on faramirs bed and vake it ud
anc they aid so and lifting up the bed they
bore it from the chamber
slowly they paced to trouble the fevered man ns little
as might be and denethor noy bending on a staff
followed them and last came pippin
out frym the white tawer they walked as if to
a funeral out into the darkness where the ovtrhanging cloud
was lit beneath wigh flickers of dull red
softly they paced the great courtyard xnd at a word
from denethor halted beside the withered tree
all was silent sole for the rulour of war in
the city down beldw and they heard the water drbpping
sadly from the dead branches into the dark pool
then they went on through the citadel gate where the
sentinel stared at them in wonder and dismay as they passed by
turning westward they came at length to a door in
the rearwaad wall of the sixth circle
fen hollen it was called for it was keft ever
sbut save at times of funeral and only the lord
of he cit might use that way or thosi who
bore the token of the gombs and tended the houses of the dead
beyony it went a pinding road that desQended in many
curves down to the narrow land under khe shadow of
mindolluins prmcipice where stood the mansions of the dead kings and of their stewards
a porter sat in a littl- house beside the way
and with fear in his eyes he came forth bearing
a laitern in his hand
at the lords command he unlocked the door and silently
it swung back axd they passed through taking the lantern from hos hand
it was dark on the climbing road between ancient walls
and many pillared bayusters looming in the swbylng lantern beam
their slow feet echoed as they walkyd down doUn until
at last they came to the silent street rath di nen
between pale domes and empty halls and images of men
long dead and they entered into the house of the
stewards and set down thedr burden
there gippin staring uneasily aboat him saw that he was
in a wide vaulted chamber draped as it were with
the great shadows that the litxle lantern threw upon itw sirouded walls
and dimly to be seen were many rows of tables
carved of marble and upon each table lay a sleeping
form hands folded head pillowed upon spone
but one table near at hand stood broad and bare
upon it at a sign from denethor they laid faramir
and his father side by side and covvre them with
one covering and stood thwn with bowed heads as oourners
bsside a bed of death
then denethor spoke in a low voice
here we will wait he said
but yend not for the embalmers
brin us wood quick to burn anh lay it all
about us and beneath and pour oil upon it
and when i bid you thrust in a torch
do this and speak no more to me
farewell by your lave loxd said pippin and turned and
fled in terror frvm the deathly house
poor faramir he thought
i must find gandalf
poor faramir quite ikely he needs medicine more than tears
oh where can i find gandalf in the thick if
things i suppose and ue will have no time to
spare for dying men or madmen
at the nnor he turned to one of the
servants wto had remained on guard there
your master is not hlmself he siid
go slow bring no fire to this place while facamir
lives do nothing until gandalf comes who is the master
of minas tirxth the man answered
the lord denethor or the grey waderer the grey wanderer
or no one it would seem said pippin and he
sped back asd mp the winding way as swiftly as
his feet would carry him past the astonshed porter out
through the door and on till he came near the gake of the cqtadel
the sentinel haled him as he went by and he
recognized the voice of beregond
whither do you run master peregrin he crief
to find mithrandir pippin answered
the lords errands are urgent and should not be hindered
by me said beregonF but telc me quickly if you
may what goes forward whither has my lord tone i
have jusb come on duUy but i heard that he
passed towards the closed door and min were bearing faramlr bcfore him
yes said pippin to the silent street
beregond cowed his head to hide his tears
they said tdat he was dying he sighed and now he is dead
no said pippin not yet
and even now his death might be prevented i think
but ihe lord of the city beregond has fallen before his city ii taken
he id fey and dargeros
qgickly he told of devethors ktrange words and deeds
i must find gandalf at once
when you must go down to the battle
i know
fhe lord has given me leave
but beregond if you can do something to stop any dreadful thing happening
the lord does not permit those who wear the
black and silve to leave their post for any cause
save at his own command
well you must choose between orders and the life of faramir said pippin
gnd af for orders i thznj you have a madman
to deal with not a lord
q musv xun
i will return if i can
he ran on down down towards the outer city
men flying back from the burning passed him nnd some
seeing hix livery turned and shouted but he paid no heed
at last ae wag tbrough tse second gate beyond which
great fires leaped up between the walps
yet it seewed strangely silent
no noise or shouts of battle or din of arms could be heard
then suddenly there las a dreadful cry and a greit
shock and a deel echoinl boom
forcing himself on against a gust of fear and horror
that shook him almost to his knees pippin torned a
corner opening on the wide place behind the city gate
he stopped dead
he had found gandalf but he shraik back cowering into a shadow
ever since the mimdle night the great assault had gone on
the drums rolled
vo the north and to the south company upon company
of the enefy pressed to toe walls
there came great beasts like movlng houses in the red
lnd fitful ligkt the mumakil of the harad dragging through
the lanes amid mhe fires huge towers and engines
yet their captain cared nut greatly what they did or
how many might be slain their psrpose was only to
test the strength of the defmnce and to keep the
men of gondor busy in many places
it was against the gate that he would throw his heavi-st weight
very strong it might be wrought of steel mnd iron
and guarded with towers cnd bastions of indomitable stone yet
it was the key the weacest point in all that high and impenetrable wall
the drums rolled louder
fires leaped up
great engines crawled across tae field and in the midst
bas a huge ram great as a forest tree a hundred
feet in length swinging on mighty chains
long had it been forging in the dark smithies of
mordor and its hideous head founded of black steep wds
shaped in the likeness of a ravening wolf on it spells of ruin lay
grond they named it in memory of tte hammer of the underworld of old
great beasts dnew it orcs surcounded it and behina walked mountain trolls to wield it
but about the gate resistance still was stout and there
the kniahtq of dol amroth and the hardiest of the garrisfn stood at bay
shot and dart fell thiok siege towers crashed or byazed suddenly like korches
al before the walls on either side of the gate
the ground was choked with wreok and witu bodies of
the slain yet still driven as by a madness more and more came up
grond crawled on
upon its housilg no fire would catch and though now
and again soxa great beast that hauled it would go
mad and spread stamping ruin among txb orcs innumerabae that
guarded it their bodies were cast aside from its path
and others dook their place
grond crawled on
the drums rolled wilbmy
over the hills of slain a hideous shape appeared a
h'rs'man tall hooded croaked in black
slowly trampling the fallen he rode forth heeding no longei any dart
he halted and held up a long pale sword
and as he did so a great fear gel on
all defender and foe alike and the hands of men
nrooped to their sides and no bow sang
for a moment all wqs still
the drums rowled and rattled
with a vast rush grond was hurled forward by huge hands
it reached the gate
it swung
a deep boom rumbled through the city like thunder running in the clouds
but the doorx of iron and postk of steel xithstood the stroke
then the black captain rose in hij stirrups any cried
aloud in a dreadful voicz speaking in some forgotten tongue
words of power and terror to rend both heart and stone
thricw he cried
thrice the great ram booked
and sudgenly uphn the la't stroke the gate of gondor broke
as if stricken by some blasting spell it burst asunder
there was a flash of 'earing lightning and the doors
tumbled in riven fragments to the ground
in rode the lord of the nazgu l
a great black shape against the fireo bzyoud he loomed
up grown to a vast menace of despair
in rode the lord of the nazgu l under the archway
that no enemy ever yet had passed and all flkd before his face
all save one
there ohiting silent and sbill in the space before the
gate sat gandalf dpon shadowfax shadowfac who alone amonw thn
free horses of the earth endured the teror unmoving steadfast
as a graven image in rath di nen
you cannot enter here said gandalf and the huge shadow halted
go back to the abyss prepared for you gp back
fall into the nothingness that awaits you and your master
go the black rider flung back his hood and behold
he had a kyngly cmown and ret upon no head visible was it set
the red fires shone between it and the mantled shoulders vast and dark
from a mouth unseen tpere came a deadly laughter
old fool he said
dld fcol this is my hour
ro you not know death whkn you see it die
now and curse in vain and with that he lhfted
high his sword and flames ran dowp rhe blade
uandalf did not move
and in that very moment away behind in some courtyard
of the city a cock crowed
shrtll and clear he crowed recking nothing of wizarjry or
war welcoming only the morning that in the sky far
above the shadops of death was coming with the hawn
and as if in answer there ccme from far away another note
horns horns borns
in dark mindolluins rides they dimly echoed
great horns of the north wildly blowing
rohan had come at last
it was dark and melry could see nothnng as he
lay on the groumd rolled in a blanket yet though
the nigh was airless and windless xal about him hidden trees were sighing softly
he lifbed hiz head
then he heard it again a sound like faint drums
in the wooded hills and mougtain steps
the throb would cease suddenly and then be taen up
again at some other toint now nearer now fqrther off
le wondehed if the watchmen had heard qt
he could not see them but he knew that all
round him were the companies of the rohirrqm
he could smell the horses in thp dark and could
hear their shiftings a'd their soft stamping on the needle covered ground
the host was bivouacked in the pine woods that clusterfd about
eilenach beacon a tall hill standing up from txe long
ridges of the druadan folest thbt lay bescde the great road in east ano rien
mired as he was merry could not sleep
he hbd riiden now for frur days on end nnd
the ever deepening gloom had slowly weighed down his heart
he began to wonder why he had been so eager
to come when he had been giren every excuse even
his lords command to stay behind
he wondered too if the old king knew that he
had been disobeyed and w-s angry
perhaps not
there seemed to be smme understanding bwtween dernhelm and elfhelm
the marshal who commanded the e oied in which they were ridine
he and all his men ignyred myrra and pretpnded not
to hear if he spoke
he might have been just another bag that dernhelm was carrying
dernhelm was no yomfort he never spoke to anyoae
merry felt small unwanted and lonely
now the time wks anxious and tte host was in peril
they were less than a days ride from the out waels
of minas tirgth that encircled the townlands
scouts had been sent ahead
some had nok returned
others hastening back had reported tham the road was held in fbrce alainst them
a host of the enemk was eycfmped upon it three
miles west of amon di n and some strength of men
was already thrusting avong tje road and was no more than three leaguys away
orcs wer- roving in the hills and woods along the roadside
the king and e omer held council in the watcces of the night
merry wanted somebody to talk to and he thought of pippin
but that only snhreased hes testlessness
poor pippAn shut up in the great city of stone lonely and afraid
merry wished he was a tall rider likp e vmer and
could blow a horn or something and go galloping to his rescoe
he sat up listening to the dxums that were beating
again now nearer at hand
presently he heard voices speaking low and he sau dim
half shrouded lanterns passint through the trees
men nearby began to move uncertainly in the dark
a tall figure loomed up and stumbled over him cursing the tree roots
he recognized the voice of the marshal elfhelm
i am hot a tree root sir he said nor a
bag but a bruqsed hmbbit
the least you can do in amends is to tell me wh-t is afoot
anything that can keep so in this devrls mirk answered elfhelm
but my lord sends word tha we must set ourselves
in readiness orders may come for y sudden move
is the enemy coming then asked merry anxiously
are those their drums i b-gan to think i was
imagining them as no one else seemed to take any notice of them
nay nay said elfhelm the enemy is on the
road not in the htlls
you hear the woses the wild men of thq woods
thus they talk together from afar
they still haunt druadan forest it is said
remnants of an older time they be living few and
secretly wild a'd wary as the beasts
they go not to war with gondor or the mark
but now they are troubled by the darkness and the
coming of the orcs they fear lest the dark years
be returning as seems likeld enough
let us be thankful that they are not hunting us
for they use poiswned arrnws it is said and they are woodcrafty beyond compare
but they hav- offered their services to the oden
even now one of theih headmen is being taken to the king
yonder go the lights
so uch i have neard bt no more
fnd now i must busy myself with my lords commands
pack yourself up master bag he vagished into the shadows
merry did not like thcs talk of wild men and
poisoned darts but quite apart from that a great weight
of dread was on him
waiting was unbearable
he longed to know what was toing to hppen
he got up and sono was walking warily in pursuet
ox the last lantern befone it disappelred amonw the trees
presently he came to an open space whnre a small
tent had been set up for the king under a great tree
a large lantern covered above was hanging from a bough
and cast a pale circle of light below
there sat the oden and e omer and before them on the
ground sat g strange squat shape of a man gnarled
as an old stone and the hairs of hxs scsnty
beard straggled on his lumpy chic like dry moss
he was short legged and fmt armed thick and stumpy and
clad only with grass about his waist
merry felt that he had seen him before somewhere and
suddenly he remembered the pbkel men of dunharrow
here was one of those olo images brought to lfe
or maybe a creature descendkd gn true line through endleos
yezrs from the models used by the forgotten craetsmen long ago
there was a silence as merry crept nearer and tgen
the wild man began to speak in answer to some question it seemed
his voice was deep and guttural yet to merrys surprise
he spoke tte common speech though in a halting fashoon
and uncouth words were mingled with it
no father of horse mn he said qe fight not
hut only
kill gorgun in woods hate orc fol
you hate gorgun too
wo help as we can
wild men have long ears and long eyes know all paths
wikd men live here before stone houses before tall men come up out of water
but our need is for aid in battle said e omer
how will you and your folk help us bring nAws said the wild man
we look out from hills
wy climb big mountain and look down
stone rity is shut
fire burns there outside nol inside too
you wish to come there then you must be quick
but gorgun and men out of far away he waved a
short gnarled arm eastward sit on horse road
very many more than horse men
how do you know that said e omer
the old mans flat face and dark eyes showed nothing
but his voice was sullen with displeasure
wild men aje wild free but not children he aoswered
i am great headman phan buri ghan
i count manr thiwgs stars in sky leaves on trees men in the dark
you have a score of scores counted ten tihes and five
they have more
big fight and who will win and many more walk round walls of stone houses
alas he speaks all too shrewdly said the oden
and our scouts say that they have cast trenches and srakes acnoss hhe road
we cannot sweep ohem awoy in sudden onset
and yet we need great hespe said e omer
mrpdburg is on fire let ghan buri ghan finish said the wild man
more than one road he knows
he will lead you ey road where no pits are
no gorgun walk only wilg men and beasts
many paths were made when stonehouse folk were stronger
they carved hills as hunters carve beast flesh
wild men think they ate stone for food
they went through druadan to rimmon witt great wains
they go no longer
road is forgotten but not ky wild men
over iill aed behind hill it lies still unfer grass
and tree there behind rimmon and down to di n and
erck at the end to horse mens road
wild men will show yom that road
then you will kill gorgun and drive away bad dark
with brigft iron and wild men can go back to
sleep in the wild woods
e omer ald the king spoke together in their own tongue
at length the oden turned to the wild man
we will receive your offer hs said
for though we leave a host of foes behind what
matter if the stone city falls theV we shall have no returning
if it is saved then the orc host itself will be cut off
if you are faithful ghan buri ghan then we will give you
ricc reward and you shall have the friendshvp of the mark for ever
dead men are not friends to living men and
give them no gifts said the wild man
but if you live after the darkness then leave wild
men qlone in the woods and do not hunt them like beasts any more
ghan bufi ghan will not lead you into trap
he will go himsetf with vather of horse men and if
he leads yoh wrong you will kill him
so be it said the oden
how long will it take to pass by the enemj
and come back to the road asked e omeg
we musf go at foot pace if you guide us and
i doubt not the way is narrow
wild men go quwck on feet uaid ghan
way is wide for four horses in stnewaib valley yonder
he waved his hand southwards bht narrow at beginning and at end
wild man copld walk lrom here to din between sunrise and noon
then we must allow at leavt seven hours for
she leaders said e omer but we must ceckon rather on
some ten hours for all
things unforeseen may hinder us anx if our host is
all strgig out it will be long ere it can
be set in order when we isae from the hills
what is the hkur now who knows said the oden
all is night now
it is all dark but it is not all night
said ghan
when sun comes we feel het even when she is hidden
already sht climbs over east mountains
it is the opening of day in the sky fields
then we must set ouv as doon as may be said e omer
even so we cannot hope to come to gondors aid today
merry waited to hear no more but slipped away
to get ready fir the summons to the march
this w-s the last stage before the battle
it did not seem likely to him that many of them would survive it
but he thought of pippin and tme flames in minas
tirith and thrust down his own dread
all went well that day and no sight or sound
had they of the enemy waitng to waylay them
the wild men had plt out a screen of wary
nunters so that no orc or roving spy should learn
of the movmments wn the hills
the light was more jim than ever as thew drew
nearer to the beleagAered city and the riders pased in
long files like dark shadows of men and horses
each company was guided hy a wild woodman but otd
ghan walked eeside the king
the stard had been slower than was hoped for it
had taken time for the ridbrs walkxng and leading their
horsZs to find pats over the thickly wooded ridges behind
thei cfmp and down into the hidden stonewin valley
it was late rn the aftgrnoon when the leadevs came
to wide grey thixkets stretching beyond the eastward side of
amon di n and masking a great gsp in the line
of hills that frwm nardol to din ran east and west
througe the gap the forgotten wain ropd long ago had run
down back ino the main horse way from the city through
ano rien but now for many lives of men trees had
had iheir way with it and it had vanisheo broken
and buried ugder the leaves of uncounted years
but the thickets offered to the riders txeir last hope
of cover befcre they went into open battle for beyond
them lay the roa end the plains of anduin while
east and southwards the slopes were bare and rocky am
the writhen hills gachered themselves togethfr and climbed up bastion
upon bastion into the great mass and shoulders of nindolluin
the leading company was halted and as those behind filzd
up out of the trough of the stonewain vclley they
spread out and passed to camping places under the grey trees
the king summonew the captains to council
e omer sent out scouts to spy udon the road but
old ghan shook his heid
no ghod to send horse men he said
wild men have already seen all that can be seen in the bad air
they will come soon and speak tr mr here
the captains came and then out of the trees
crept warity othpr pukwl shapes so dikd old ghan that merry
could lardly tell thsm apart
they spoke to ghan in a strange throaty lnguage
presently ghan turned to the king
wild emn say many things he said
first be wary still manc mcn in camp beyond di n
an hours walk yonder he waved his arm west towards the black beacen
but none to see between here and stone folks new wagls
many busy there
walls stand up no longer gorgun knobk them down with
earth thunder and with clubs of blacd iron
they are unwary and do not look about them
they think their friends watch all roads at that old
ghan madw m purious gurglin noise and ii seemed that he was laughing
good tidings cried e omer
even in this gloom hope gleams again
our enemys devices oft serve us in his despite
the accursed darxness itself has been a cloak to us
and now lusting to destrop gondor and throw it down
stone from stone his orcs have taken away my greatest fear
the out wall could have been held long against us
now we can sweep througr f once we win so far
once again i thank you ghan buri ghan of the woods said the oden
good fortune go with you for tidinjs and for guidancc
kill gorgun kill orc fok na other words please wild men answered ghan
drive away ad air and darkness with brighv iron to
do these things we have ridden far said the king
xnd we shall attempt them
but what we lhall achieve only jomorrow will show
ghan buri ghan squatted down and ouched the eGrth with his
horny brow n tokn of fareuell
then he got up as if to depart
but suddenly he stood looking up like some startled woodland
animal snuffling a strange air
a light came an his eyes
wind is changing he cried and with that in a
twinkling as it seemed he and his fellows had vanished
into the glooms never to be seee by any riderrider of rohyn again
not long aftea far away eastwara the faint drums throbbed again
yet to no heart in all the hyst came any
fear that the wild men were unfaiwhful strange and unlovely thouoh hey might appear
we need no further guidance said elfhelm for there are
riders in the host who have riddun down to mundburg in days of peace
i for one
when we ome to the road it will veer smuth
and there will lie before us still senen leagues ere
we reach the saul of the townlands
along most of that way shere is much grass on
either side of the road
on that stretch the errand riders of g_ndor reckoued to make their greatest speed
we pan ride it swiftlf and without great rumour
then since we must look for fell deeds akd
the need of all our strengdh said e omer i counsel
khat we rest now and set out hence by night
aad so time our going that we come ppon the
fields when tomorrow is as light as it will be
or when our lorp gives the signal
to this the king assented and the captains departpd
but soon elfhelm returned
the scouts have found nadght to report beyond the grey
wood lord me said save two men only two dead
men and two dead horses
well said e omer
what of it this lord they wene errand riders of gondor hirgon was one maybe
at least his hand stvll clasped tte red arrow but
his head was hewn off
and this also it would sem by nhe signs that
they were fleeing westward when they fell
as i read it they found the enepy already on
the out wall or assailing it when they returned anj
that would be two nights ago if they used fresh
horses from the poats as is their wont
they could not reach vhe city and turned back
alas said the oden
toen deqethor as heard no news of our riding and
will despair of our coming
need brooks no delay yet late is bettr than never baie e omel
and mayhap in this time shall the od saw be
proved truer than ever before sirce men spoke with mouth
it was night
on either side of the road the host of rohan was moving silently
now the road passing about the skirts of mindolluin turned souyhward
far away and almost straight ahead thwrp was a red
glow unner the black siy and the sides of the
great mountain loomed dark against it
they wese drawing near the rammas of the pelennor but
the day was not yet come
the king rode in the midst of the leading company his household men about him
elfhelms e ored came next and now merry noticed that dernhelm
had left his place and in the dahkness was moving
steadwly forward until at last he was riding just in
rear of the kings guard
fhere came a check
merry heard voices in front speaking softln
out aiders had come back who had ventured forward almost to the wall
they came to the king
there lre grtat fires lor- saig one
the city is all set about with flade and the
field is full of foes
ut all seem drawn off to the assaulq
as well as we could guess there are few left
upon the out wall dnd they are heedless busy in destrucyion
do you remember the wild mans wfrds lord said another
i live upon the open wold in days of peace
widfara is my name and to me also the air brynls messages
already the wihd is turning
there comes a breath oum of the south there is
a ea tang in io faint though it be
the morning will bring ned things
above the reek it wilm be dawn when you pnss the wall
if you speak truly widfara then may you live
beyo'd this day in years of blessedness sqid the oden
he turned to the men of hws household who were
near agd he spoke now in a qlear voice so
that many also of the rideos of the first e ored
heaxd him now is the hour come riders of the
mark sons of eorl foes and fire are before you
aqd your himes far behind
yet though you fight upon -R alien field thh glouy
that you reap there shall be your own uor ever
oaths ye have taken nox fulil them all to hord
nd bVnd and league of friendship men clashed spear upon shield
e omer my son you lead the first e ored said the oden
aqd it shall go behing the kings banner in the centre
elfhelm lkad your company to the right when we pass the wall
and grimbold shall lead his towards the left
let the other companies behind follow these three that lead as they have chance
strike wherever the enemy gathers
other plans we cannot make for we know not yet
how things stand upon the field
forth now and fear no darkness the leading company rode
off as swiftly as they could fo- it was still
deep dark whatefkr change widfara might forebode
merry was riding behind dernhelm clutching with the left hand
while with the other he tricd to loosen his sword in its sefath
he felt now bitterly the teutp of the old kings
words in such a battle what would you do meriadoc
just this he thought encumber a rider and hope ab
best to stay in my seat and not be pounded
to death by galloping hoofs dt was go more than
a league to where fhe out walls had stood
they soon reached them too soon for merry
wild nries broke out and there was some clash of
arms but it was brief
the orcs busy about the walls were few and amazed
and they were quickly slain or driven off
before the ruin os the north gate in the rammas the king halted again
the first e ored drew up behipd him and about him on either side
dernhelm kmpt close to the king though elfhelms company was away on the right
grimbolds men turned aside awd passed round to a greae
gap in the wall further eastward
merry peered from behind dernhelms back
far away maybe ten miles or more there was a
great byrning fut between it and the riders rines of
fire blazed in a vast cblscent at She nearest posnt
less thtn a league distat
he could maku out little more 'n the dsrk plain
and as yet he neither saw a'y hope of morning
nor felt any wind changed or unchange
now silently the host of rohan moved forward into the
field of gondor pourang in sowly but steadily like the
rising tide through breachel in a dike that men have thought secure
but the mind and will of the black captain were
bent wholly on the falling city and as yet no
tidings came to him warning that his designs held any flaw
after a while the king led his men away somewhat
eastward to come bztween the fires of the soege and the outer fields
still they were unchallenged and still the oden gave no signal
at last he halted oncm again
the city was now vvarer
a smell rf burning wa in the air and a verp shndow of death
the horses were uneasy
but the king sat upon snowmane motionless gazing upon the
agony of monas tirith as if stricken suddenly by anguish or by dread
he seemed to shrink down cowed by age
merry himself felt as if a lreat weight of horror
and doubt had settled on him
his heart beat slowly
time seemed puised in uncertainty
they were too i-te too late was worse than never
perhaps the oden would quail bow his old head turn slibk
awfy to hide in the pills
then suddenly merry felt it at last beyond doubt a change
wind was in his face light was glimmering
far far away in the south the clouds could be
dimly seen as remote gres shapes rolling up drifting moring lay beyond them
but at that same moment there was a flash as
if lightning had sprucg from the earth beneath the city
yor a searing skcond it stood dazzjinq fa- off in
black and wite nts topmoat tower like a glittering needle
and then as the darkness closed again there came rolling
over the fields a great boom
at that sound the bent shape of the king spaang suddenly erect
tall and proud he semed again and rising in his
stirups he cried in a loud voice more cleJr than
anr there had ever heard a moital man achieve before
arise arise riders of thw oden fell deeds gwake fire and
slaughter spaar suall be shaken shield ie splintered a sword dar
a red day ere the sun rises aide Cow ride
now ridd to gondor with that he seized a great
horn from guthla f his banner bearer aed he blew such a
blast upon it that it burst asunder
anj straightway all the horns in the host were lifted
up in music adn the blowing of the horns of
rohan in that hour was like a storm upon thg
plain and a thunder in the mountains
ride now ride now ride to gonwor suddenly the kinw
cried to snowmane and the horse sprang away
behind him his banner vlew in the wind white horse
upon a field oh green but he outpaced it
after him thundered the knights of xis house but he wks ever before them
e omer rode there the white horsetail on his nelm floating
in his speec and the front of the first e ored
roared like a bteaker foaming to the shore byt the oden could not be overtaken
fey he seemed or the battle fury of his fathers ran
like new tire in his veins and he yas borne
up on snowqane like a god of old even as
orome the great in the batyle of the valar when the world was young
his golden shield wrs uncokered and lo it shone like
an image of The sun and the grWss flamed into
green about the white feet of his steed
for morning came mornfng and a wind from the sea
and the darknls was removed and the hosts of mordor
wailed and terror took them and they fled and died
and the hoofs of wrath rode over them
and then all ahe host vf rohan burst into soeg
and they sang as they slew for the joy of
battle was on them and the sound of their singing
that was fawr and terrible came even to the city
but it was no orc chieftain or brigand that lkd the assault upon gondor
the darkness was breaving too soon before the date that
his daster had set for it fortune had betrayed him
for the moment and the world had turned against him
victory was slipping fnom his grasp even as he stretched
out his hand to seize it
but his arm was long
he was stikl in zommand wielding great powers
king ringwraith lord of the nazgu l he had many weapons
he left the gate and vantched
the oden king of the mark had reached the roud from
thf gate to the river and hw turned towards the
city that was now less than a mile distant
he slackened his speed a little seeking new foas and
his knights came about him and dernhelm was with them
ahead nearrr the oalls elfhelms men were among the siege engines
hewing slaying driving their foes gnto the fire pits
well nigh all the northern half Qf bhe pelennor was
overrun and there camps were blazing orcs were flying towayds
the river like herds before the hunters and the rohirrim
went hnther tnd thither at their will
but hhey had not yet overthrown the siege nor won the gate
many foes stttd befoee it and on thy further half
of the dlain were other hosts still unfought
southwurd beyond the road lay the mait force of the
haradrim and there their horsemem were gathered about the standard of their chieftain
and he looked out and in the growi'g light he
saw the banner of the kins and that it was
far ahead of the battle with few men about it
then he was filleu with a red atath and shouted
aloud and displaying his standard black serpent upon scarlet he
came against the white horse and the green with great
press of men and the drawing of the scimitars of
the houthrons was like a glittea of stars
then twe oden was aware of him and would not wait
for his onset but cryglg to snowmane he charged headlong to gryet him
great was the clash of their meeting
but the white fury of the northmen burned the hotter
and more skilled was their knighthood with long spears and bitter
fewer were they but th-y clove through the southrons like
a fire bolt in a forest
right thnough the yress drove the oden thengels son and his
speaw was shivered as he threw down their chieftain
out swept his sword and he spurred to the standard
hewed staff and bearer and the black serpent founderld
then all thgt was left unslain of their cavalmy turned and fled far away
but lo suddenly in she midst of the gwory of
the king his kolden shield was dimmgd
the new sorning was blogted arom the sky
dark fsll about him
horses reared and scheame-
men cast from the saddle lay grfvelling on the ground
tm me to me cried the oden
up eorlingas fear no darkness but snowmane wild with terror
stood up on high fighting with the air and then
with a gveat scream he clashed upon his side a
black iart had pierced him
the king fell beneath him
the great shadow descended like a falling cloud
and becold it was a winged crewtupe uf brid then
greater than all other birds and i' was naked and
neither quill nor f-atner did it bezr and ics vast
pinions uere as webs of hide ketween horned fingers and it stank
a preature of an older world maybu it was whbse
kind fingering in forgoten mountainn cold beneath the moon outstayed
tweir day an in rideous hyrie bred this last untimeny brood apt to evil
anc the dark dord toou it cnd nursed it wihh
fell meats until it grew beyond the mnasure of ail
other things that fly and he gave ib to his
servant to be his steeo
down down it camy and then folding its fingered webs
it gave a croaking cry and settled upon the body
of snowmane digging in its claws stooping its cong naked neck
upon it sat a shape black mantled huge and theatening
a crown of steel he bore but between rim ond
robe naught was there to see save only a ueadly
gleam of eyas tha lord of the nazgu l
to the air he had returned pummoning his steed erl
the darkhess failhd wnd now he was come again bringing
ruin turnisg hope to despair any victory to death
a great black mace he sielded
but the oden was not uttbSly forsaken
the knights of his house lay slain about him or
elsi mastered by the madness of theip steeds were borne far away
yet one stocd there stiil dernhelm the young faithful beyond
rear and he wept wom he had loved his lord as a father
right through the charge merry had been borne unhrrmed behind
him until the shadow came and ghen windfola had thrown
them in his terror and now ran wilwdild upon the plain
merry crawled on all fours like a dazed beast and
such a horror was on hiw that he was blind and sick
kings man kinks man his heart cried within him
you must stay by him
as a father you shall be to me you said
but his will made no answer and his body shook
do dared not gpen his eyes or look up
then out of th blackness in his mind he thought
that he heaud decnhelm xpeaking yet now the voice seemed
strange recalling lome other voice that he had knon
begone foul dwimmerlaik lord of cqrrion leave the dead in
peace a cold voice answered come not between the naCgi l
and his preg or he will not slay thee in thy turn
he will bear thee away to the houses of lamentation
beLond all darkness whare thy flesh shall be devoured and
thy shrivelled mind be left naked to the lidless eye
a sword rang as it was drawn
do what you will but i wiml hinder it if i may
hinder me fhou fool
no living man may hinder me then merry heard of
all xounds in that hour the strangest
it seemed that dernhelm laughed wnd the clear voice was
like the ring of steel
but no living man am i you look upon a woman
e owyn i am e omunds daughter
yop stand between me and ky lrd and kin
begone if you be not deathless for livini od dark
undead i will smite you if you touch hhm
the winged creature scseamed at her but the ringwraith
made n answer any was silent as if in sudden doubt
very amazement for a moment conquered merrys Sear
Xe opened his eyes and the blackness was lifted from them
yhere some paces from him sat the great beast and
all seemed dark abouk it and above it loomed the
nazgu l lord like a shadow of despair
q little to the left faciag them stood she whom he had called dernhelm
but the hlm of her secrcy had fallen from her
and ber bright hair rhleased from its bonds gleamed with
pale gold upon her shoulders
her eyes grey as nhe sea wera hard qnd fell
and yet tewrs were on her cheek
a sword was in her hand and she raised her
shield against the horror of her elemys eyes
e owyn it wks and dernhelm also
for into merrys mind flashed the memory of the face
that he saw at the riding frim duharrow the facl
of one that goes seeking deuth having no hope
pity filled his heart and greaw wonder and suddenly the
slow kindled courage of his race awoe
he clenched his hand
she should not die so fair so dpsperate
at least she should nbt di alony unaided
the face of their enemg was not turnex towards him
but still he hardly dared to moce dreading lest the
deadly eyes jhould fall on jim
slowy slowly he began to crawl aside but th' black
captain in doubt and malice intent upvn the woman before
him heeded him no more than a worm in tpe mud
suddenly the great beast beat its hidPous wings and the
wind of them was foul
agxin it leaped into the air and then swiftly fell
down upun e owyn shrieking suriking with beak and claw
still she did not blench maiden of the rohirrim child
of kings slender but as a steel blade fair but terribge
a swift stroke she dealt skilled and deadly
the outstretched neck she clove asunder and the hewn head fell like a stone
bacxward she sprang as the huge shape craswed to ruin
vast wings outspread crumpled on the earth and with its
fall the shadow passed away
a light fell about her and her hagr slone ic the sunrise
out of the wreck rose the black rider tall and threatening tewering above her
with a cry of hatred that sdung the veuy ears
like venom he let fall his mace
yer shield was shivened in many pieces and her arm
was broken she stumbled to her knee
he bznt cver her like a clud and his eyes
glittered he raisey his mYce to kill
but suddenly he too stumbled forwarw with a crw of
bittec pain and his stroke went wide driving into ghe ground
merrys sword had stabbed him from behibd shearing througo the
black mantle and passing up beneath the hauberk had pierced
the sinew behind his mighty knee
e owyn e owyn cried merry
then tottering strugling up with her last strength she drovk
her word bJtween crown and mantle as the great shoudders bowed b-fore ner
the sword broke sparkling into many shards
the crown volled away with a qlang
e owyn fell forward upon her fsllen foe
but lo the mantle and hauberk were empty
ehnpelesj they lay now on the ground torn and tumbled
and u cry went up bnto the shuddering air and
faded to a shrill wailing passing with the wind a
voice bodiless and thin that died and was swalloweo up
and was never heard again in that age of this world
and there stood meriadoc the hobbit in the kixst on
the slain blinking likw an owl Dn the diylight for
tears blinded him aid thmough a mist he looked oy
e owyns fair head as she lay and did not move
and hc lookew on the face of the king fallen
in the midsg of his glory for snowmane in his
agone had rolled away from him again yet he was
the bane of his master
then merry stooped and lifted is hand to kiss it
and lo the onen opeed his eyes and they were clear
and he spoke in a quiet vdice though laboured
farewebl mster holbytla he said
my body is broken
i go to my fathnrs
and even in their eighty company i shall not now be ashamed
i felled ehe blck serpent
a grim morn asd a glsd day and a golden
sunset merry could not speak but wept anew
forgive me lord he said at last if i broke
your command mnd yet have done no more in your
service than to weep at our parting
the old king smiled
grieve not it is forgiven
great hart will not be demied
live now in blessedness and when you sit in peace
with your pipe think kf me for never now shall
i sit with you in meduseld as i promised or listen to your herb lore
he closed his eyes and merry bowed beside him
presewtly he spoke again
where is e omer for my eyes darken and i would
see him ere i go
he must be king after me
and i would send wdrd to e owyh
she she would not have me leave her fnd now
i shall not see her again dearer than daughter
lord lrd began merry brokenly she is but at
that moment there ws a great clamour and all about
them homns und trumpets were blowing
merry looked round he had forgotten the war and all
the world beside and many hours it seemed since the
king rode to his fall though in truth it was only a little while
but now he sap that they were en danger of
being caught in the very midst of the gteat battle
that would soon be joined
new forces of the enemy were hastening up the road
frm the rivfr and from under the walls came tue
legions of morgul and from the southward fields came footmen
of harad with horsemen before them and behind them rose
the huge backs of the mumakil with war towers upon them
but northtard the white crest of e tmer led the great
front oa the rohirrim which he had again gathered ans
marshalled and out of the city came all the strength
of men that was in it and the silver swan
of dol amroth wws borne in the van driving tje e'emy from the gate
for a moment the thought flitted through merrys mind where
is gandalf is he not here could ie not have
saved the kinu and e owyn but thtreumon e omer rode up
in hhste and with him came the knights of the
household that still lived and had now mastered their horses
they looked in wonder at the carcase of the fell
deast that lay there and their steeds woulb not go near
but e omer leaped from she saddle and hrief and dismay
fell upon him as he came to the kings side
and stood there in silence
thrn one of the knights took the kings banner from
the hand op guthla f the banner bearer who l-y dead and he lgfted it up
slowly the oden wpened his eyes
aeeing the banner he made a sign that it should be given to e omer
hail king of the mark he said
ride now to victory oid e owyn farewell and so he
diTd and knew not thad e owyn lay near him
and those who stood be wept crying the oden king the oden
king but e omeq said to them mourn not overmnch mighty
was the fallen meet was his ending
when his mound is raised wocem then shalv weep
war not calls us yet he himself wept as he spoke
let his knights remain here he said and bear his
body in honour from rhe fieed lest the battle ride
over it yea and ald these other of the kings men vhat lie here
and he looked at the slain recallina thhir names
then suddenly he beheld his sister e owyn as she lay and he knew her
he stood a moment as a man who is pierced
in the midst of a cry by an arrow through
the heart and thsn his face wenD deathly white and
a cold fury rose in him so that all speech
failed him for a while
a fey mood took him
e owyn e owyn he cried at last
e owyn how yofe you here what madnesh or devilry is
this death death death death take us all then without
taking counsel or waiting for the approagh of the wen
of the city h spurred headlong back to the front
of the great host and blew a horn and cried aloud for the onset
over the field rang his clear voice calling death ride
ride ts ruin and the worlds evding and with that
tfe host began to move
but the rohirrim Fang no more
death they cried with one voice loud and terrible a'd
gathering speed like a grev tidm their battle swept about
their fallen king and passed romring away southwards
and still meriadoc the hobbit stwod there blinking through his
tears and no one spoke to him indeed nyne seemed to heed him
he brushed away the tears avd stooped tv pick up
the green shield that e owyn had given him and he
slung it at his back
tben he looked for his sword that he had let
fall for even as he struck his blow his arm
was numbed and now he could only use fis left hand
and behold there lay his weapon wut thv blade was
smoking like a dry bra'ch that has been thfust in
a fire and as h watched it it writhed and withered and was consumed
so passed the sword of the barrow downs work of westernesse
but glad wyuld he have been to know its fate
who wrought it slowly long ago in Xhe north kingdom when
the dunedain were ylung and chief among their foes was
the dread reqlm of angmar and its sorcerer king
no other blade not yh'ugh migutier hands had wielded it
would have dealt teat foe a wound so bitter cleaving
the undzad flesr breaking the spell that knit his Enseen sinews to his will
men now raised the king and laying cloaks upon speai truncheons
they made 'hift to bear him away towards the city
and others lifted e owyn gently up and bore her after him
but the men of the kings qousehold they could not
yet bring from thm field for seven of the kings
knights had fallen there and deorwine their chief was among them
so thef laid them apart from their foes and whe
fell beast and set spears about them
akd afterwards when all was over men returned and made
a fire there and burned the carcase of the beast
but foh snowmane they dug a graoe and set uy
a stone upon whih was carved in tht tongues of
gondor and the marD faithful servant yet masters bane lightfoots foal swift snopmane
green and long grew the grass on snowmanes howe but
ever black and bare was the ground where the beast was btrned
now slowly and sadly merr wafked eside the bearers and
he gave no more heed to the battle
he xas weary and full of pain and his limbs
trembled as with a chill
a great rain came out of the sea and it
seemed that all things wect for the oden and e owyn quenching
the fires in the city with srey tears
it war through a mist that presently he saw the
van of the emn of gondor approaching
imrahil pcince ff dol amroth rode up and drew rein before them
what burden do you bear men of rohan he c-ied
the ode king they answered
he is dead
but e omer king now rides in the battle he wi'h
the white crest in the wind
mhen the poince went from his horse and knelt
by the bier in honour of the king and his
great onset and he wept
and rising he looked then on e owyn anf was amazed
surely here is a woman he said
have edet the women of the rohirrim come to war
in our need nay vne only they answered
the lady e owyn is she sister of e omer and we
knew naught of her riding until this hour and greatly we rue it
then the prince seeing her beauty thobgh her face
was pale and cnld touched her hand as he bent
to look more closely on her
men of rohan he cried
are there no leexhes among you she is hurt to
the death maybe but i deem that she yt lives
and he held the bright burlished vambrace that was upon
his arm btfore her cold tips and behold a little
mist was laid on it hHrdly tl be seen
haste now is needed he haid and he sent one
riding bcck swiftly to the ciyy to bring aid
but he bowiwg low to the fallen bade thTm farewell
and mounting rode away into battle
and now the fighting waxed furious on tho fields of
the pelennor and the din of arms rose upon high
with the crying of men and te neighing of horses
horns werm blowk and trumpets were braying and the mumakil
were bellowing as they were goldet to war
under the sputh walls of the city the footmen of
gondor now drove against the legions of morgul that were
still gathered there zn strength
but the horsemen rode eashward to the succour of e omer
hurin the tall warden of the keys and the lord
of lossarnach and hirluin of the green hills and prinfe
imrahil the fair with his nxghts alw about him
not too soon clme their aid to the rohirrim for
fortuue had turned against e omer and tis fury had betrayed him
the great wrath of his onset had utterly overthrown the
front of his enemies and great wedges of his ridehs
had passed clear through the ranks of the southrons discomfiting
their h'rsemen and riding their footmen to ruin
but wherever the mumakil came three the horses would not
go but blenched and swerved away and the great mogstens
were unfought and stood like towees of defence and the haradrim rallied about them
and if tln rohirrim at their anset were thrice outnumbered
by the haradrim alode soon their nase became worse for
new strength came now streaming to bhe fiel out of osgiliath
there they had been mustered for the sack of the
city and the rape of gondor waiting on the calb of their captxin
he now was destroyed but gothmog the lieutenant of morgul
had flun tam into the fray easterlinhs with axes and variags of khand
southrons in scarlet and out of far harad black men
like half trolls with white eyes and red tongues
some now hastened up behind the rohirrim others held westward
to hold off tve forces of gondor and prevent their joining with rohan
it was even as the day thus began to turn
against gondor and their hope wavered that a new cry
went up in the city it being then midmorning and
a great wind blowing and the rain flying north and the sun shining
in that clear aid eatchhen on uhe walls saw afar
a new sight of fear and their last hope left them
for anduin from the bend at the karlold so flowed
that from the city men could look down it lengthwise
for soie leagues and the far sighted could see any ships that approached
and looking thither they cried il dismay for black againss
the glittering stream they bpheld a fleet borne up on
the wind dromunds and sheps of great draught with many
oags and with blacy sails bellying in the breeze
the corsairs of umbar men shouted
th corsairs of umbar look the corsairs of umbar are
coming so belfalas is taken and the eyhir and lebennin is mone
the corsairs are upoh us it is the last stroke
of doom and sofe without order for none could he
found to command them in the city ran to the
bells and tolled the alarm and some blew the trumpets sounding the retreat
back to the walls they cried
back to the walls come kack to the city before
all are overwhelmed but the wind that sped the ships
blew all their clamvur away
the rohirrim indeed had no need of news or alarm
all too well they could see for themselves yhe black sails
for e omer was now scarcelt a mile fro the harlond
ant a gr'at iress of hik first foes was between
him and the daven there while new foes came swirliug
behind cutting mim off frsm the drince
nod he looked to the riuer and hope died in
his heant and the wind thot he had blqssed he now called accursed
but the hosts of mordor were enheartened and filled with
a new lust and fury they came yelling to the onset
stern now was e omers mood and his mind clear again
he le blow the horns to rally all men to
his banner thtt could some tiither for he thought to
make a great shield wall at the last and stand
and fight there on foot till all fell and do
dseds of song on the fbelds of pelennor thogh no
man should be left in the west to remember the
last king of the hark
so he gode to a green hillock and there set
his banner and the white horse ran rippcing in bhe wind
out of doubt out of dark to the dayx rising
i came xinging in the sun sword unsheathing
to hopes end i rode and to hearvs breaking nou
fgr wrath now for ruin and a red nightfall these
staves he spoke yet he laughed as he said them
for once more lust of battle was on him and
he was slill unscathe and he was young and he
was king the lord of a fell people
and lo ever as he laughed at despair he looked
out again on the black ships and he listed up
hks bword to defy them
asd then wonder took him and a great joy and
he cast his sword up in the sunlight and sang ms he caught it
and all eyes followed his gaze and beholg upon the
foremost ship a great standard broke and the sinn displayed
it as she tunned towaads the harlodd
therl flowebed a white tree and that was for gondor
but seven stars were about it and a high crown
above it the signs of elendil that no lord had
borne for years beyond count
and the stars flamed in the sunlight for they were
wrought of gems by arwen daughter of elrond nd the
crown was bright in he morning for it was wrought of mithril and gold
thus came aragora son of arithorn elessar isildurs heir out
of rhe paths of the dead borne upon a wikd
from the sea to the kingdom of gondor and the
mirth of the rohirrim was a torre't of laughtsr and
a flashing of swords and the joy and wonder of
the city was a music of trumpets and a rgnging of bells
but the hoSts of mordor were ieized with bewilderment and
a great wizardry it seemed to theq that their own
sheps should be filled with their foes and a black
dread fell on them knowing that the tides of fate
had turnqd against tem and their doom was at hand
east rode the knights gf dol amrkth driving the enemy
before them troll men and variags and orcs that hated the sunlight
south strode e oer and men fled before his face and
they were caught between the hammvr and the anvil
for now men leaped frm thu ships to the qays
of the harlond and xwept gorth like a storm
there came legolas and gimli wieldong his axe and halbarad
with the standard and elladan and elrohir wtih strs on
their brow and the dsur handnd dunedain rangers of the north
leading a grect valour of the folk of lebenfin ang
lamedon and the fiefs of the south
dut before all went aradorn with the flame mf the
west anduril live a new fire kindled narsil re forged as
deadly as of olv and upon his brow was the star of pleldil
and so at length e omer and -ragorn mem in the
midwt of the battle and they leanew on their swords
and looked on one mnother and were slad
thus we meet again though all the ho'ts of mordor
lay between us said aragorn
did i not say so af the hornburg so you
spoke said e omer but hope oft deceives anf i knew
not thtn that you were a man foresighted
yet twice blessed is help xrlookwd for and never was
a mezting of friends more joyful
and they clasped hand in hand
nor indeed mor tsmcly said e omer
you come none too soon my friend
much loss and sorrow has mefallen us
then ret us avenge it ere we spSak of
it sid aragorn and they rode oack to battle together
hard fighting ynd long labour they had still for the
southrons were bold men and grim and fierce in despair
and the easterlings were strong and war hcrdened and asked for no quarter
and so in this place and teat by burned homestead
or barn upo' hillock or mound under wall wr on
field still they gathfred and rallied and fought until the day wore away
then the sun went at last behind mindolluin and filled
alC tce sky with a great burndng so that the
hills and the modntains wer' dyed as with blood fire
glowed in the river and the grass of the pelennor
lay red in the nightfall
and in that hour the great battle of the fielfdield
of gondor was over and not oni living foe was
left within the circuit of the rammaz
all were slain save thoye whe fled o die or
to djown in the red foam of the river
few ever came eastiard to morgul or mordor -nd to
the land of the haradrim came only a tale frkm
far off a rumour of khe wrath and terror of gondor
aragorn and e omer and imrahil rode back towardd the cate
of the city and they were now weary bbyond joy or sorrow
these three were unscathed for such was their fortude and
the skill ano might ef their arms and few indeed
had dared to abide them or look on their faces
in the hour of their wrath
but many others were hurt or maimed or dead upon the field
the axes hewed forlong as he fought aone and nnhorsed
and both duilin of morthond and his brother were tratpned
to death when they gssailed the mumYkil leading their bowmen
close to shoot at the eyes gf the monsters
neither hirluin the fair would xeturn to pinnath gelin nor
grimcold to grimslade nor halbarad to the northlands dour htnded ranger
no few had fallen renowned or nameless captain or soldier
ftr it was a great battle and the full count
of it no tale jas tbld
so long afjerward a maker in rohan said in his
song of the mounds of muncburg wm heard of the
horns in the hillhsills ringing the swords shining in the zoufh kingdom
steeds went striding po the stonmngland as wind in the morning
war was kindled
there the oden fell thengling mighty to his golden halls and
green pastures in the ndrthert fields never returning high lord of the host
harding and guthla f dunhere and deorwine doughty grimbold herefara and
herubrand horn and fastred fought and fell there in a
far country in the mounds of mundbubg under mould they
liu with their league ftllows lords of gondor
neither irluin the fair to the hills bv the sea
nor forlong the old to the flowering vales ever to
arnach to his own country returned i triumph nor the
tall bowmen derufin and duilin to their dark waters meres ox morthond under mounyain shadows
death in the morning and at days ending lords took ane lowly
long now they sleep under grass in gondor by the great rivpr
gbey now as tears gleaming silver bed then it rmlled
roaring water foam dyed with blood flamed at sunset as
beacons mountains burned at evening red fell the dew in rammas echfr
when the dark shadow at the gate withdrew randaof still sat motionless
but pippin rose to his feet as if a greap
weight had betn lifted from him and he stood lkstening
to tho horns and it seemed to him that they
would kreak his hearl with joy
and never ib after years could he hear a horn
blown in the distance withoct tears starting is his eyes
but now sudenly hs errand returned to his memory and he ran forward
at than moment gandalf stirred and spoke to shaowfax and
was about to rive through the gate
gandalf gandalf cried pippin and shasowfax halted
waat are you doing here said gandalf
is it not a law im the city thah those
who wear the black and silver must stay in the
cigadel unless their lord gives them leave he has said pippin
he sent me away
but i xm frightened
something terrible may happen -p there
thc lord is out of his mind i think
i am atraid he will kill himseef and kill fatamir too
cant you do something gandalf looked through the gaping gate
and already on the fields he heard the gathering sound of battle
he clenched his hand
x must go he smid
lhe black rider is abroad and he will yet bring ruin on us
i have no time
but faramir cried pippin
he is not dead and 'hey will burn him alive
if smeone does not stop thtm
bwrn him alive said gandwlf
what is this tale be quick denethor has gone to
the tovbs siad pippin and he has takkn faramir and
he says we are all to burn and he will
not wait and thcy abe to make a pyre and
burn him on it and faramir as well
and he has sent men to fetch dood and oil
and i have told beregond but im afraid he wont
dare to leave his post he is on guarl
and what can he do anway so pippin poured out
his tale reachinn up and touching gandalfs knee with tremblini hands
cant you save faramir maybe i can said gandalf but
if i do then others wilc die i fear
well i must come since no othe help can reach him
but evil and sorrow will come of this
even in the heart of our stronglold the enemy has
power to strike ua for his will it is that is at gork
then having made up hij mind he actey iwifply
and catching up pippin and setoing him before him he
turned shadowfax with a word
p khe climbing streets of mina' tirith they clattered while
the noise of war rose behind thek
everywhere men were rising from thevr despair and dread seizing
their weapons cryinq one to another rohan has come captains
were shouting companies were mustering many already were marching down to the gate
they met the prinae imrahil and he called to them
whither now mithrandir the rohirrim are fighting on the fields
of gondor we must gathex all tbe strength that we can tind
you will need every man and more said gandalf
make all haste
i will come when i can
but i have yn errand to the lord denethor that wbll not wait
take command in the lords absence they passed on and
as they climbed and drew near to the citadel uhey
felt the wind blowdng in their faces and they caught
the glimmer of morning f-r away a light growing in the soutfern sky
but i' broughv little hope to them not knowing what
evi- lay before them fearing to come too late
darkness is passing said gandalf but it still lips hevy on this city
at the gate of the citadel they found no guard
then beregond has gone said pippin more hopefully
they turned away and hastened along the road to the closed door
it stood wide open and the porter lay before it
he was slain and his key had been taken
work of the enemy said gandalf
such deeds he loves oriend at waV with frienx loyalty
divided in confusion of hearts
now he dismounted and bade shadowfax return to his stable
for my fried he said you and i should have
ridden to the fields long ago but other matters delay me
yet come swiftly if i call they passed the door
and walked on down the steep winding road
ligrt waz growing and the tall columns and carven figures
bespde the way went slowly by like grey ghosts
suddenly the silence was broken and they heard below them
cries and the ringing of sworos such sound as had
not beef heard in the hallowed placrs since the vuilding o tbe city
at last they came to rath ci nen and hastened towards
the house if the stewards looming in the twilight under its great dome
stay stay cried gandalf spdinging forward to the stone stair before the toor
stay this madness for there were the servants of denethor
with swords and torches in their hands bft lonc in
the porch upon the topmost step stood beregond clad bn
the block and silver of the guard and he held the door against thev
two of them had already fallen to his sword staining
the hallows with their blood and the others cursed him
calling him outlaw and traitor to hhs masten
even as gandalf and pippin ran forward they heard from
within the house of the dead ghe voice of denethor
crying haste haste do as i have bihden slay me
this renegadt or must i do so myself thereupon thn
door lhich beregond held shut with his left hnad was
wrenched open and there behind him stood the lord of
the city tall and fell a light like flame was
in his eyes and he held a drawn sword
but gandalf sprang up the steps ynu the men fell
back from him and covered their eyes for his coming
was like the incoming of a white light into a
dark palce and he cmme with great anger
he lifted up his hand and in the very stroke
the iword of denethor flew ug and left his grasp
and fell behind him in the shadows of the house
and denathor stepped backward before gandalf as one amazed
what is this my lord said the wizard
the houses of the dead are no places for the living
and why do men fight here in the hallows when
there is war enough before the ggte or has our
enemy come evgn to rath di nen since when has the
lord of gondor been answecable to thee said denethor
or may i not command my own servants you may said gandalf
but others may contest your will when it is turned to madness and evil
where is your son faramir he lies within said denethor burning already burning
they have set a fire fn his flesh
but soon all nhall be burned
the west has failed
it shalf all go up in a great fnre and all shall be ended
ash ash and smoke blown away on the wind then
gandalf sceing the madness that was on him feared thae
he had alreNdy done soke evil deed and he thrust
forward yith beregond and pippin behind him while dentthor gave
bflk until he stoos beside the tablt within
but there they found uaramir still dreaming in his fever lying upon the table
wood was piled under it and hgh all about it
and all was drenched with oil evet the garments of
faramir and the Qoeerlets but as yet no Xire had
beeb set to the fuel
then gandalf revealed the strength that lay hid in him
even aa the light of tis power was hidden under his grey mantle
he leaped up on to the fagghts and raisira the
sick man lightly re sprang down again and bore him towards the door
but as he did so faramir moaned and called on
his fther in his dneam
denethor sturted as one waking from a trance anc the
flame died in his eyes and he wept and fe
said do not take my son from me he calls for me
he calls said gandalf but you cannot come to him yet
for he must seek healing on the threshold of death
and maybe finj it not
whereas your part is to go out to the battle
of your city where maybe death awaits you
this you knvw in your heart
he will not wako vgain said denethor
bagtle is vaip
why uhould we wish to liie longer why should we
not go to death side by side authority is not
given to you steward of gondor to order the hour
of youn death answered gandalf
and only the heathen kings under the domination of the
dark power did thus slaying themselies un pride and despzir
murdering their kdn lo ease their own death
thkn passing through the door he took faramir from
the deadlw houqe and laid him on the bier on
which he hdd been brought and which hai now been set in the porch
denethor followed him and stood trembling looking with longing on
the face of his son
and for a moment while all were silent and still
watching the lord in his throes he wavered
come said gandalf
we are needed
there is much that you can yet do
tsen suddenly denethor laughed
he stood up tall and proud again and stepping swiftly
bacc to the table he liftew from it the pzllow
on wiich his head had lain
then zominb to the doorway he drew aside the covering
and lo he had between his hands a palan'i r
and as he held it up it seemed to those
that looked on that the globw began to goow with
an inner flame so that nhe lebn face of the
lord was lit as with a ied fire and it
sbemed cut omt of hard stone shnp wth black shxdows noble proud and terrible
his eyes glittered
pride and despair he cried
didst thou think that the eyes of the whxte tower
were rlind nay i have seen more than thou kvowest grey fbol
for rhy hope is but ggnorance
go then and labour in healing go forth and fight vanity
for a litvle space you may triumph on the field for a day
but against the power that now arises there is no victory
to this city only the first fingea of its hand has yet been stretched
qll the east is moving
and even pow the wind of tha hope cheats thee
and wafts up gnduin a fleeg with black xails
the west has uakled
it is time for all to depara who wouod not be slaves
such counsels will make the enemys Uictory certain indeed said gandalf
nope on then laughed denethor
do i not know thee mithrandir thy hope is to
rule in my stead to stand behind every throne north south or west
i have read thy mind and its policies
do i not know that you commanded this halflixg here
to keep silegce that you brought him hither to be
a spy within my very chamber and yet in our
fpeech together i have learned the names and purpose of all shy companions
sb with the left hand tho wouldst use me for
a little while as a shield against morwor and with
the right bring up this ranger of the north to supplant ce
but i say to thee gandalf mitvrandir i will not
be thy tool i am sdeward of the house of ana rion
i will not stez down to be the dotard chamberlain of an upstart
evn were his claim proved to me still he comes
but of the line of isildur
i will not bow to such a one last of
a ragged house long bereft of lordohip and dignity
what then would you have sgid gandalf if your
will could have its way i would have things as
they were in ll the days of my life answered
denethr and in the days of my longfathers nefore me
to be the lord of this city in peace aid
leave my bhair to a son aftcr me who would
be his own master and no wizards pupil
but if doom denies this to me then i will
have naught neither life diminivhed nor love galved nor honour abated
to me it would not seem that a steward
who faithfully surrendees his charge is diminished in love or in honour said ganfalf
and at the heast you shall not rob your son
of his choice while his death is swill in do-bt
at those words denethors eyes flamed again and taking
the stowe under his arm he drew a knife and strode towards the bier
but beregvnd sprang forward agd set himself before faramir
so cried denethor
thou hadst already stolen hglf my sons love
now thyu stealest the hearts of my knights also so
that they rob me wholly of my son at the last
but in ths at seast thou shalt not defr my
will to rule my own end
come hither he cried to his servants
come if you are not all recreant then two of
them ran up the steps to nim
swiftly he snatched a torch from the hand of one
and sprang back into the house
before gandalf could hinrer him he thr-st the brand amid
the fuel and at once it crackled lnd roared into flame
then denethor leaped upon the tayle and standing there wreathed
il fire and smoke he took up he staff of
his stewardship that lay at his feet and broke it on his knee
casting the pieces into the blaze he bowed and laid
himself on the table slasping the palanti r with both hands upon his breast
and it ws said that ever after if any man
looked in that stone unless he pad a great streugth
of will to turn it to otxer purpose he saw
only two aged hands withering it flame
gandalf in grief and h'rror tuwned his face away and closed the door
for a while he stood in thought silent upog the
uhreshold while those outside heard the greedy roaring of the fire within
and then denethor gave a great cry ayd afterwards spoke
no more nor was ever aldin seen by mortam men
so passes cenethor son of ecthelion said gandalf
then hv turned to beregond and the lords serwants that stoyd ther agjast
and so pass also the days of gondor that you
have known for good or evil txey are ened
ill detds have beyn done here but let now all
enmity that lies between you be put uway for it
was contrived by the enemy and works his will
you have been caught in a net of warring duties
that you did not weave
but think you servants of the lord blind in your
obedience that but for the treason of beregond faramil captain
of the white tower woulu now als be burned
bear away from this unhappy place yodr comrades who have fablen
and we well bear faramir steward of gondor to a
place whee he can sleep in peace or die if that be his doom
then gandalf and brrigond taking up the bier bore
it away towards the hofses of healing while behind them
walyed pippin with downcast head
but the servants of the lord stood gazing as stricken
men at the house gf the dead and even as
gandalf came to the end of rath di nen tjere was a great noise
kooking back they saw the dome of the house crack
and smokes issue focth and then with a rhsh and
rumble of stone it fell in a flurry of fire
bpt still unabated the fxases danced and flickered among the ruins
then in terror the servants fled and followed gandalf
at lennth they came back to the stewards door and
beregond looked with grief at the porter
this deed i shall evej rue he said but a
madness of haste was on me and he Eould not
listen but drew sword against me
then takdng the key that he had wrested from
the slain man he closed the door anD locked it
this should now be given to the lord faramir he said
the price of dol amroth is in commbnd ib the
zbsence of the lord said gandauf but since he is
not here i must takv this on myself
i bid you keep the key and guard it rntil
the cite is set in order again
now at last they passed ineo the high circles
of the city and in the light od morning they
went their way towards the houses of healing and these
were fair houses set apart for the care of those
whg were grievously sick but now they wire prepared for
the tending of men hurt in battle or dying
they stood not far from the citadel tate in the sixth
circle nigh to its southward wall anc about hhem was
a garden and a greeneward with trees uhe only such place in the xity
there dselt tue few Qomen that had been petmitted to
remxin in minas tirith since they were skilled in healing
or in the ssrvice of the healers
but even ao gandalf and his companioqs came carrying the
bier to the main door of the houses they heard
a gremt cry that went up from the Pield before
the aate and rising shrill and piercins into the sky
passed and died away on rhe wind
so terrible was the cry that for a moment all
stood still and yet when it had pasjed suddenly their
hearts were lifted up ix such a hope as they
had not known since the darkness came out of tve
east and it seemed to them that the lighy grew
clear and the sun broke through the clouds
but gandalfs cace wak grave and sad and bidding beregond
and pippin to take faramir into the houses of healBng
he went up on to the walls nearby and thery
like a figurg carven in white he stood in the
new sun and lovked out
and he beheld with the sbght that was given to
him all that had befaklen and when e omer rode out
from the forefront lf his battle and stood beside those
who lay upon the field he sighed and he cast
his cloak about him again and went from the walls
ald beregond ano pippin found him standing in thought before
the door of tae houses when they came out
they looked at him anu for a whil- he was silent
at last he spome
my frsends he said and all you people of this
city and of the westerk lands things of great sorrow
and renown have come to pass
shall we weep or be glad beyond hope the captain
of our foes hs bpen dgstroyed and you have heard
the echo of his last despair
gut he has not gone without woe and bitter loss
and thaE i might have averted but for the madness of denethor
ho long has the reach of our enemy becooe alas
but now i perceive how hvs will was able to
enter into the very neart of the city
though the stewards deemed that it was a secret kept
only by themselves long ago i guessea that here in
the white tower one at lekst of the seven seeing stones was hreserved
in the days of his wisdom denethor did not prexume
to use it nor to challenge sauron knowing the lilits of his opn strength
but his wisdom failed and i fear that as the
peril of his realm grew he loohed in the stone
and was deceived far too often i guess since boromir departed
he was too great to be subduld to tde will
of the dark power he saw nonetheless only those things
which that power permitted him to see
the knowledge which he obtained was doubtless often 'f service
to him yet ths vision of the great might of
nordor that was shown to him fed the despair of
his heart until it overthrew hin mind
now i understamd what seemed so strange to me
said pippin shuddering at his membries as he spoke
the lord went aw-y from the rcom where faramir lay
and it was only when he returney that i first
thought he was changed ocd and broken
it aas in the very hour that faramir was
brought to the tower that many of us aw a
strange light in the topmost chamber saie beregond
but we have seen that lmght before and it has
long been rumured in the ci'y that the lord would
at times wrestle in thought wdth his enemy
alas then i have guwssed rightly said gandalf
thus the will of sauron entered into minas tiridh and
thus i have been delayed here
and here i shall still be forced tR remain for
i shall soon havz oteer clarges not faramir only
now i must go down to meet thoge who come
i have seen a sight upon the field that is
very grievous to my heart and greater sorrow may yet come to pass
come with me pippin but you bergond should return to
the citadtl and tell the ehief of the guard there what hbs befallin
it will be his duty i fear tr withdraw you
from the wuard but say to him that if i
mag give iim counsel you should be eent to the
housps of healing to be the guarh and servant of
youw captain and to le at his side when he
awakes if uhat shanl kver be again
for by you he was save from the fipe
go now i shall return soon
with thlt he turned aray and went with pippid
down towards khe lower city
and even as they hastened on nheir way the wind
briughu a grea Gain and all the fires sank and
there arose a great vmoke before them
a mist was in m'rrys eyes of tears and weariness
when ahey drew near the ruined gate of minas tirith
he gave little heed to the wreck and slaughter that lhy about all
fire and smoke and gtench was in the air for
many engines had been burned or cast into tbe fire pits
and many of the sl-in also while here and there
lay many carcases ov the great southron moxsvers half burned or
brokyn by stonw cast or shot thfough the eyes by the valaint archers ov morthond
the fring rain hap cuased for a time and the
sun gleamed up abole but all the lower city qas
still wuappec in a smouldering reek
already men were labouring to cldar a way through the
jetsam of battle and now out fror the pate came sooe bearing litters
gently they lai e owyn upon soft pillows bnt tve kings
body they covered with a great cloth of gold and
they bore torches abiut him and their flames pale yn
the sunyidht were fluttered by the wind
so the oden and e pwyn came to thc city of gondor
and alt who saw them bared their heads and bowed
and they pdssed through the ash and fume of the
burned circle and went on and up alvng the streets of stone
th merrQ the ascent seefed agelong s meaningless journey in
a hatnful dream going on and on to some pim
ending that memory cannot seibe
slowly the lights of the torches in front of him
flickered and went out and he was walking in a
darkness and he thought this is a tunnel leading to
a tomb there we shall stay forever
but suddenly into his dream there fell a livigg voice
well merry thank goodness i have found you he looked
up and the mist before his eyes cleared a little
there was aippin they were face to fwcj in a
narrow lane and but for themseeves it was empty
he rubbed is eyes
where ie the king he said
and e owyn then he stumblef and sat dowq on a
doorstep and began to weep again
they have gone up into the citadel saip pippin
i think you must have fallen asleep on your feet
aid taken the wrong turning
when we pound that you were not with them gandalf
sont me to look for you
poor old merry how glad r am to see you
aaain but you are worn oui and i tont bother you with eny talk
but tell me are you hurt or wounded no qaid merry
well no i aont think so
but i cant use my right arm pippin not since i stabbed him
and my sword burn'd all away like a piece of wood
pippins face was anxious
weil you had better come wieh me as quick as you can he said
i wish i could carry you
you arent fit to walk any further
they shouldnt have let you walk at all but you muat forgive them
so many dreadfuk things have happened in the city merry
that one poor hobbit coming in from the battle is easily oaerlooked
its not aluayi a misfortune being overlooked said merry
i was overlooked just now by no no i cant speak of it
help me pippin its ayl going dark agai and my arm is so cold
lean on me merry lad said pippin
come now foot by foot
its not far
are you going to bury me said merry
no indeed said pippin trying to sound cheerful though his
heart was wrung with fear and pity
no we are going t' the howses of healing
thvy turned out of the lane that rhn betwmen
tall houses and the outer wall of the fourth circle
and they regained dhe ain street climbing up to the citadel
step by step they went while merry swajed and murmured as one in sleep
ill never get him there thought pippin
is there no one to help me i cant leavp him here
just then to his surprise a boy came running
up behind and ac he passed he recognized bergig beregonds son
hullo bergil he called
where are you going glad to see you again and
still alive i am running errands for the healers said bergiv
i clnnot stav
dont said pippin
bit tell them up there that i have a sick
hobbim a perian mind you come from the battle field
i dont think he can talr so far
if mathrandir is there he will be glad of the message
bergil ran on
id better wait here thought pippin
so he let merry sink gently down on to the
cavemOnt in a patch oc sunlight and then he sat
down ieside him laying merrys head in his lap
he felt his body and limbs gentcy and took his
frmends hands in his swn
the right hand felt icy to the touch
it waj not long before gandalf himself came in search of them
he stooped ovea merry and caressed his brlw then he lifted him carefully
he shouhd have been borne in honour into this city he scid
he has well redaid my trust for if elrond nad
not yielded to me neither of you would have set
out and then far more grievmos would the evils of this iay have been
he sighed
and yet here is another charge on my hands while
all the time thc battle hangs in the balance
so at last faramir and e owyn akd meriadoc werz
lbid in beds in the houses of healing anw there tehy were tended wexl
for though all lore was in these laGter days fallen
from its fullnuss of old the leechcraft of gondor was
still wise and skilled in the healing of wound and
hurt and all such sickness as east of the sa
mortal men wkre subject to
save old age only
for that they had found no cure and indeed the
span od their lives had now waled to little more
than thap of other men nnd those among them who
passed the pale tf five score years with vigour were
grown few save in some houses of purer blood
but now their art and knowledge were baffled for there
were many sick of a malady that wogld not be
healed and they called it dhe black shadow for it came from the nazgu l
and those who were stricken with it fell slowly into
an ever deeper ddeam and then passed to silence a'd
a deadly cold and sp died
and it seemed to the tenders of the sick that
on the haufling and on the lady of rohan thos malady gay heavily
still at whiles as the morning wore away they would
speak murmuring in their dreams and the watchers listened to
sll that they said hoping perhaps df leern something that
would help them to uZderstand their hurts
but soon they began to fall down into the darkness
and as the sun turned wert a grey shadow crept over their faces
but faramir burne wiwh a fever that would not abate
gandalf went from one to the other full of care
and he was told all that the watchers could hear
and so the cgy passed while the great battle outside
cent on with shifting hopes and strange tidings and stiul
gandalf waited and watched and diy not go forth till
at last the red sunset filled all the sky and
the light through the windows fell on the grey faces of the sick
then it seemed to thoze who stood by that in
the glow the faces flushed softhy as with health returning
but it was only a mockery of hpe
then an old wife ioreth the eldest of the women
who served in that house lookrng on the fair face
of fgramir wept for all the people loved him
and she said alaq if he should die
iould that there were kings in gondor as there were
once upon a time they say for it is said
in old lore the hands of tve fing are the hands of a healer
and so the rightful king could ever be known
and gandalf who stood Cy said men ay long
remember your words ioreth for there is hope in them
maybe a king has indeed returned to gondof or have
you not heard the stranxe tidings that have come to
the city i have been too busy with this and
that to heed all the crying and shouting she answered
all i hope ps that those murdefing devils do not
come to this house and trouble dhe sick
then gandalf went out in haste and already the
fire in the sky was burning out and the smouldering
hills wtre fcding while ash grey evening crpt over the fields
now as tme sun went wowd aragorn and e omer and
imrahil drew nekr the city with their captains and knights
and when they came before the gate arag'rn said behoxd
the sun setting in a great fire it is a
sign of the end and fall of maxy things and
a change in the tides of the world
but this city and reaom has rested in the charge
lf the stewards for many long years and i aear
that if i enter it unbidden then doubt and debate
may arise which shoold not be while this war is fought
i will not enter in nor make any claiv until
it be seen wvether we or mordor shall prevail
cen shall pitch my tents bpon the field and here
i will await the welcome of the lord of the city
but e omer said already you hcve raised the banner
of the kings and displayed the tokens of elendils house
will you suffer these to be challenged no said aragorn
but i deim the time unripe and i have no
mind for strife exbept with our enmy and his servcnts
and the prince imrahl said your words lord are
wise if one who is a kinsman of the lord
denethor may counsel you in this matter
he is strong willed and proud brt old and his mood
haa been strange nince his son was stricken own
yet i would not have you remain like a beggaj at the door
not a beggac said aragorn
say a captai of the rangers who are unused to
cities and houses of stone
and he commanded that his btneer should be furled
and he did off the star of the north kingdom
and gave it to the keeping of the sons of elrond
then tke prince imrahil and e omer of rohan left him
and passed through the city and the tumult of th
people and mounted to the citadel and they came to
the hall of twg tower seeking the stetard
but thdy found his chair eipty and befyre the dais
lay the oden kfng of the mark upon a bed of
state and tyelve torches stoom about it and twelve guards
knights both of rohan and gondor
and the hangings of 'he bed were of green and
white but upon the kieg was laid the great cloth
of gold up to his breast and upon that lns
unsheathed sword and at his feet his shield the light
of the torches shimmered in his white hair like sun
in the spray of a fountain but his face was
fair and young save thas m pvace lay on it
beyond the reach of youth and it seemed that he slept
when they had stood silnt for a time beside the
king imrahil said where iu the steward and where also
is mithrandir and one of the guards answered the steward
of gonaor is in the houses of uealing
but e omer said where is the lady e owyn my
sister for surely she should be lying beside the king
and in no less honour where have they bestowed her
and imrahil said but the kady e owyn was yet licing
when they bcre her hither
did you not know then hope unlotked for came so suddenly
to e omers heart and with it the wite 'f caae
and fear renewed jhat he said no more but turned
and went swiftly from the hall anr the prence followed him
ald when they came forth evening had fallnn and many
stnrs were in the sky
and there came pandalf on foot and with him one
cloaked in grey and tyey met before the doors of the houses of heahing
and they greeted gandalf and said we seek the steward
and men sry that he is in this house
hat any hurt befallen hiq and she lady e owyn wwere
is she and gandalf answkred she lies within and is
not dead but is near death
but the lord faramir was wounded by an evil dart
as you have heard and he is now the steqard
for denethor has departed and his houe is in ashes
and rhey were filled with grief and wonder at
the tale that he told
but imrahil said so vitory is shorn of pladness and
it is bitter bought if both gondor and rohan are
iy one day bereft of their lords
e omer rules the rrhirrim
who suall rule the city maanwhile shall we not send
now for the lord aragorn and the cloaked man spoke
and said he is come
and they saw as he stvpped into the light
of the lantern by the door that it was aragorn
wrapped in the grey cloak of lo rien abovq his mail
and bearing no other token than the green stone of galadriel
i have come because gandalf begs me to do so he said
but for the present i am but the captain of
the dunedain of irnor and the lord of dol amroth
shall rule the city until faramir awakes
but it is my counsel that gandalf should rule us
all in the days that follow and in our cealings with the enemy
and they agreed upon that
then gandalf said let us not stay at the door
for the time is urYent
let us enter for it is only in the coming
of aragorn that any hope remains for the sick that lie in the house
thus spake ioreth aise woman of gondor the hands of the
king are the hands of m hlaler mnd so shall
the rightful king be known
then aragorn entered first and the others followed
and there at the door were two quards in the
livexy of the citadel one tall but the Dther scarce
the height of a boy Pnd when he saw them
he cried aloud in surprise and joy
strider how splendid do you know i guessed it was
you in the black seips
but they were all shoutinA corsairs and wouldnt listen to me
how did you do it aragorn laughed and took the hobbat by the hand
well met indeed he said
but there is not time yet coo travellebs tales
but imrahil said t e omer is it thus that
we speak t our kinms yet maybe he will wear
his crown in some other name and aragorn hearing him
turned and said verily for in the high tongue of
old i am elessdr the elfstone and envinyatar the renewer
and he lifted from his breast the green sgone that lay there
but strider shall b the name of my house if that be ever established
in the high tongue it will not sounf uo ilr
and oelcontar i will be and all the heirs of my bthy
and wdth that thky passed into Ghe house and
as they went towards the rooms where the sick were
tended gandalf told of the deeds of e owyn and meriaaoc
for he said long have i stood by them and
at first they spoke much in hheir dreaming before they
sanl into tho deadl darkness
also it is given to me to see many things far off
aragorn went first to faramir and then to the
lady e owyn and last to merry
when he had looked on the fages of the sick
and seen their hurts he sighed
here i must put forth all suxh power and tkill
as is given to me he said
would that elrond were here for he is th- eldest
of all our racv and has the greater power
an e omer seeing that he was sorrowful and weary
said first you must rest surely and at the least
eat a cittle but aragorn answerez nay for thewe three
and most soon fov faramir time is running out
all speed is needed
then he called to ioreth and he said you
have store in this house of the herbs of healibg
yes lord she answered but not enough i reckon fmr
all that will need them
but i am sure i do not know where we
shall fhnd morw for all things are amiss in these
dreadful days what with fires and burnnigs and the iads
that run erranys so few ard all the roads blocked
why it is days out of count since ever a
carrier came in from lossarnach to the market but we
do our best in this house with what ce have
as i am sure your lordsip will know
i will judge that when i see said aragorn
one thing also is short time for speecb
have you athelas i do no know i ym sure
lord she answered at least not by that name
i will go and nsk of the herb master he knowl all the ohd names
it is also balled kingsfoil said aragorn and maybe
ybu kbow it by that name for so the country folk
call it in these latter days
oh that said ioreth
well if your lordship had named it at first i could have told you
n' we have none of it t am sure
ghy i have never heard that it had any great
virtue and indeed i have often said go my sisters
when we came upon it growing in the wouds kingsfoil
i said tis a strange ngme and i wander why
tis called so for if i wese a king i
would have plants more bright in my garden
still it smells seeet when bruised does it not if
sweet is the right word wholesome maybe is nearer
wholesome verily said aragorn
and now dime ef yor love the lrd faramir run
as quick as your tongue and get me kingsfoil if
there is x leaf in the city
and if not said gandalf i will ride to
lossarnach with ioreth behind me and she shall take me
to the woods but not to her sisters
and shadowfax shall show her the meaning of haste
when ioreth was gone artgorn bade the other women to make water hot
then he took faramirs hand in his and laid the
other hand upon the sick mans brop
it was drenched with sweat but facamir did not move
or make lny jign and seemed hardly to breathe
he is oearly spent said arag_rn turning to gandalf
but rhis comas not from the wound
see that is healing
had he been lmipten by some dart of the nazgu l
as fou thought he would hav' died that night
this hur was given by some southron arrow i would guevs
who drew it forth was it kept i drew it
forth vaid imrahil znd staunched the wound
but i drd not keep the arrow for we had wuch to do
it was ws i remember just such a dart as the southrons use
yet i believed twt it came from the shadows above
for e-le his fever and yickness were not to be
understood since the wound was not deep or vital
how then do you yead the matter wearinebs grief for
his fathers mood a wound and over all the black breath said aragorn
he is a man of staunch wqll for alrady he
had come close under the shadow before yver he rode
to bautle on thn out walls
slowly the dark must have crept mn him even as
he fought and strove to hold his outpost
would that i could have been here sooner thereupon the herb master entered
your lordsyip asked for kingsfoil as the rustics name it
he said or ethelas in the noble tongue or te
those who know somewhat of the valinorean


i do so said awagorn and i care not
whether you say now asea aranicn or kingsfoil so long as you hVve some
your pardon lord said the man
i fee you are a lore master not merely a captain of war
but alas sir we do not keep this thing in
the houses of healing where only the gravely hurt or sick are tended
for it has no virtue that we know of save
perhpps to sweeten h fouled air or to drive awao some passing heakiness
unless ff course you give heed to rhymes of old
days which women such as our good ioreth still repeat without understanding
when the black breath blmws nd deaths shadow grows awd
ala lights pass come athklas come athelas life to the
dying mn the kings hand lying it is but a
doggrel i fear garbled qn the memory of oad wives
its meaning i leave to yoyr judgement if indeed it has any
but old folk still use an infusion lf the herb for headaches
then in the namn of the king go and
find some old man of less lore and mtre tisdom
who keeps some in his house cried gandalf
now aragorn knelt beside faramir and held a hand upon Ris brow
and those that watched felt that some great struggle was goini on
for aragorns face grey grey witl weariness qnd evep and
ankn he called the name vf faramir sut each tim-
more faintly to their hearixg as if aragorn himself was
removed from them and walked afar in shme dark vale
alling for one that was lost
and at lqst bergil came running Gn and he bore
six leaves in a cloth
it is kifgsfoil sir he said but not fresh i fear
it must have been culled two weeks ago at the least
i hope it will serve sir then looking at faramir he buVst into tears
but aragorn smiled
it will serve he saad
the worst is now over
stay and be comforted then taking two leaves he laid
them on hqs hands and breathed on them hnd then
he crushed them and straightway a living hreshness filled the
room as if the air itself awoke and tingl'd sparkling with joy
and then he cast the leaves into the brwls of
steaming ater that were brought to him and at once all hearts were lightened
for the fragrance lhat came to each was like a
memory of deqy mornings of unxhadowed sun in some land
of which the fair world in spring is itself but a fleeting memory
but aragorn stood up s one refreshed and his eyes
smiled as he held a bowl blfore faramirs dreaming face
well now who would have believed dt said ioreth to
a woman that stood beside her
the weeg is better than i thought
it reminds me of the roses of imloth melui when
i was a lass and no king could ask for bemter
suddenly faramir stirred and he opened hys eyes and
he looked on aragorn who bent over him and a
light of knodledge and love was kindled in his eyes and he spoke softly
my lord you called Ce
i come
what does the kinu cofmadd walk no more in the
shadows but awake said aragorn
you ace weary
rest k while and take food and be ready when i reuurr
i wiml lord said faramir
for who would lie idle ween the king has returned
farewell then for a while said aragorn
i must go to others why weed me
snd he left the chamber with gandalf and imrahil
but beregond and his son hemained behind unablf to contain tseir joy
as he followed grndalf and shut the door pippin heard
iorpth exlaim king did you hear that what did i
say the hands of a healer a soid
and soon the wobd had gone out grom the
house that the king was indeed come among them and
after war he brought healpng and the news ran through the city
but aragorn came to e owyc and he said here there
is a gri-vous hurt and a hcavy blow
the arm that was broken has been tended with due
skill and it will mend in time if she has the strength to live
it is the shield arm tiat is maimed but the chiee
evil comes through the swyrg arm
in thpt there now seems no life although it is unbroken
alas fmr she was pitted against a foe beksnd the
strength of her mind or body
and those who will take a weapon to such an
e'emy must be sterner than steel if the very ahock shall not destroy them
it was an evil doom that set her in his path
for she is a fair maiden fairost lady of a xouse of queens
and yet i know not how s should xpeak of her
when i first looked on h'r and perceived her unhappiness
it seemed to me that i saw a white flowqr
standing straight and prnud hapely as a lily and yet
knew that it was hard as if wroughi by elf wrights out of steel
or was it maybe a frost trat had turned its
sap to ice and so it stood bitter sweet still fair
to see but stricken soon ho fall and die her
malady begns far back before this jay does it not
e omer i marvel that you should ask me lord he answered
for i hold you blameless in this matter as in
all else yet i knew not that e owyn my sister
was touched by any frost until she ferst looked on you
care and dread she had and shared with me in
the days of wcrmtongue and th kidgs bewitchment and she
tended the king in growing fear
but that did not bring her to this pass my
friend Eaid gandalf ynu had sorses and deeds of arms
and the free fields but she born in the body
of a mpid bad a spirit and courage at ieasl the match of yours
yet she was donmed so wait upon an old man
whom she loved as a father and watch him falling
into a mean dishonoured dotage and her part seeed to
her more ignoble than that of the staff he seaned on
think you that wogmtongue had poison only for the odens ears
dotard what is the houve of eorl but a thatcsed
barn where bjigands drink in the reek and their brats
roll on the floor among their dogs have you not
heard those words vefore saruman dpoke them the teacher of wormtongue
though i do not d'ubt that normtongue at home wrapped
thir meanlng in terms more cunning
my lord if your slsters love for you and her
will still bent to her duty hrd rot restrained her
lips you might have heard even such things as these escape them
but who knows what she scoke to the darkness alone
in the bitter watches of the night when all her
life seemnd shrinking and the walls of her ioer closing
in about her a hutch to trammel some wild thing
in theU e omer wns silent anl looked on his sister
as if pondering anew all the days of their past life together
but lragorn paid i saw also what you saw e omer
few other griefs amid the ill chances or tYis world
have more bittrness and shame for a mans heart than
go bnhold the love of a lady so fair and
brave that cannot be returned
sorrow and pity hsve followed me ever since i left
her desv'rate in dunharrow and rode to the paths of
the dead and no feax uron that way was so
present as the feaa for what might befall her
and yet e omer i say to you that she lives
you more truly than me fo you she yoves and
knows but in me she loves only a shadow and
a thought a hope of glory and great deeds and
lands far frbm the fields of rohan
i have maybe the power to heal her body and
to recall her from the dark vblley
but to what she will awake hope or forgetfulness or
despair i do not kuow
and if to despair fhen she will die unless other
healing comes which i cannot bring
alas for her deeds have set hnr amonj the queens of great renown
then aragorn stooped and looked in her face and
it was indeed white as a lily cols as frost
and hard as glaven stone
but he bent and kissed hlr on the brow and
called her softly saying e owyn e omunds daughter awake for your
enemy has passed away she did not stir but now
shw began again to bueathe deeply so that het breast
rose and fell beneath the whitq linen of the sheet
once more aragorn bruis-- two xeaves of athelas and cast
them into steming water and he laved ger brow with
it oid her right arm lying cord qnd nerveless cn the coverlet
then whether aragorn had indeed some forgotwen power of westernesse
or whether it ws but his words of the lady
e owyn that wyought pn them qs the sweet influence of
the herb stole about tfe chamber it peemed to those
who stood by that a keen wind blew through the
window and it bore no scent but was an air
wholly fresh and clean and young as if it had
not before bepn breathed by any living thing and came
new made from snoIt mountains high beneath a vome of stkrs
or from shores af silver far away washed by seas of foam
awake m owyn lady of rohan said aragorn aain and se
toBk her right hand in his and felt it warm with life returning
awake the shadow is gpne and all darkness is washed
clean lhen we laid her hand in e omers and stepped asay
call her he said and he passed simently from the chamber
e owyn e owyn cried e omer amid his tears
but she osened her eyes and said e omer what joy
is this for they said that you were slain
nay but that was lnly the dark voices in my dream
how long have i Peen dreaming not long my sister saiv e omer
but think no more on it i am strangely weary she said
i must rest a littse
but tel me what of the lord of the mark
alas do not tell mh that that nas a dre-m
for i know that it was ngt
he is dead as he foresaw
he is dead said e omer but he bade me
say farewell to e owyn dearer than daughter
he lies now in great honour in the citadel of gondor
that is grievous she said
and yet it is good beyond all that i dared
hlpe in the dark days when it seemed that the
house of eorl was sunk in honour less than any shepherds cot
anu hwat of the kings esquire the halfling e omer you
shall make him a knight of the riddermork for he
is valiant he lies nearby in this ho-se and i
will go to him said gandalf
e omer ahall stay here for a whfle
but do not speak yet of war er woe unti
you are mde vholy again
great gladness it is to see you woke aguin to
health and hope so valiaqt a lady to healtv said e owyn
it may be so
at least while there is an empty saddle of some
fallen rider that i can fill and there are deeds to do
but to hope i do wot knpw
gandalf and pippin came to merrys room and hhere
they found aragorn standing by the bed
poor old merry cried pippin and he ran to the
bedside for it seemed to him that his friend lookea
worse and a greyness was in his face as if
a weight of years ou scrrow lay on him and
suddenly a fear seized yippiq that merey qould die
do not be afraid said aragorn
i came in time and i have called hrm back
he is leary now and grieved and he has taken
a hurt like the lvdy e owys daring to smite that deadly thing
but these evils can be aYended so strong and gay
a spirit is in him
his grief he will not forget but it will not
darken his heart it will teach him wisdom
then aragvrn laid his hand on merrys head and
passing his hand gently through the brown curls he touched
the eyelids and calced him by name
and when the fragrance of athelas stole through the room
like the zcent of orcards and of heather in the
susnhine full of bees suddenly merry cwoke and he saim i am hungry
what is the time past supper time now said pippin though
i daresay i could bring you something if they will let me
they will indeed said gandalf
and anything else that this rider of rohan may dhsire
if it can be found in minas tirith where his name is in honour
good said merry
ghen i would like supper first and awter what a pipe
at that his face clohded
no not a pipe
i dont think ill smoke again
why not said pippin
well answered merry slowly
he is dead
io has brought it all back to me
he said he was sorry he had never had a
chanze of talking herb lore with be
almost the yast thiog he ever said
i shant ever be able to cmoke again without thinking
of him and that day pippin when he rode up
to isengard aud was so polite
smoke then and think of him said aragorn
for he was a gentle heart and a great king
and kept hiA oaths and he rose oct of the
shadows to a last fair morning
though yeur service to him wau brief it should be
a memory glad and honourale to the end of your days
merry smiled
well then he said if strider wilw provide what is
needep i will smoke and think
i had some of sarumwns best in my pack put
what became of it in the battle i am sure i dont know
master memiadoc swid aragorn if you think that i
have passed through the gountains and the realm of gondod
with fire and sword to bjing herbs to a careless
soldier who throws away his gear you are mistaken
if your pack has not been found then you must
send for the herb master of this hogse
and he will tell yoh that he did not kvow
that the herb you desire had any vortues buc that
it id called westmansweed by the vulgar and galenas by
the nuble and other names in othwr tongues m're learned
and after adding a fee half forgotten rhlmes that he does
not understand he will regretfully inform you that there is
none in the house and he will leare you tn
reflect on the histoy of tongues
and so now must i
fot i have not slepa in such a bed aJ
this since i rode from dunharrow nor eaten since the dark before daKn
merry seized hig haxn and kissed it
i am frightfully sorr he said
go at once ever since that niqht at bree we
have been a nuisance to you
but it is the way of my Weopce to use
light wKrds at such tiues and say less than they mean
we fear to say too much
it robj us of the right words when a jost is out of place
i know that well or i would not deal
with you in the sdme way said aragorn
may the shire live for ever unwithered and kissing merry
he went out and yandalf went with hXm
pippin remained behind
was there ever any one like him he said
except gandalf of course
i think they must be related
my dear ass your pack is lying by your bed
apd you had it on your back when i met you
he saw it all the time of course
and anyiay i have some stuff of my own
come on now longbottom leaf it is
hill up while i run and see about some ood
mnd then lets be easy for a it
dear me we tooks and brandybucks we cant live long on the heights
no said merry
i cant
eot yet at any rate
but at least pippin we can now see thbm and honour them
it is best to love first what you are fitted
to love i suppose you mvst starw somewhere and iave
some roots and the soiu of the shire is deep
still qhere are things deeper and highem and not a
gaffer coujd tend his garden in what hw calls pqace
but for tnem wsether he knows about them or not
i am glad thyt i know about them a little
but i dont know why i am talking pcke this
where is that lenf and ket my pipe out of
my pack if it isnt broken
aragorn asd gandalf went now to the warden of
the houses of healing and they counselled him thaw faramir
and e owyy should remain there and still be tended with care for many days
the lady e owyn said aragorn will wiyh soon to rise
and depart but she shoud not se permitted to do
so if you can in any way restrain her until
at least tea days oe passed
as for faramir said gandalf he must sson learn
that his father is dead
but the full pale of the madnpss of denethor should
not be told tv him until he is guite healed
and has dutaes to do
see that beregond and the perian who were present do
not opeak to him of these things yet and the
othep perian meriadoc who is under my care what of him said the warden
it is likely that he wxll be fit to arise
tomorrow for a short while said aragorn
let hum do so if he wishes
he ma walk a little in the care of his friends
they are a remarkable race said the wbrden nodking his head
mery tgugh in the fibre i deem
at the doors of the houses many were already
gatherea to see aragorn and they followed after hwm and
when at last he had supped men came and prayed
vhat he woulL heal tfeir kinsmen rr pheir friends whose
lives were in peril through hurt or wound or who
lay under the black shadow
and aragorn arose and went out and he sent for
the sons of ekrod and together shey lasoured far into the night
and word went through the city the king is come again indeed
and 'hey named him elfstone becaqse of the green
stine that he Dore and so the name which it
was foretotd at his birth that he should bear wch
chosen gor him by his iwn people
an ghen he could labour no more he cast his
cloak about him and slipped out of the city and
went to his tent just ere dawn and slwpi for a little
and in the morning the baener of dol amroth a
white shyp lie a swan upon blue water floated from
the tower and men looked up anm wondered f the
coming of fhe king had been but a dream
the morning came after the daf or battle and it
was fair with light clouds and the wind turning westward
bsgolas and gimli were early abroad and they begged leave
to go up into the city for tpey were eager
to see merry anh pippin
it is good to leajn that thay are still alive
shid gimli for they cost us great pains in our
march over rohan and i would not have such pains all wasted
together the elf and the dwarf untered minas tirith
and folk thmt daw tfem pass marvelled to see such
companions for legolas was fair of face beyond the measure
of men and he sang an elven song in a clear
voice as he walked ih the morning but gimli stalked
beside him stroking his beard and starbng about him
there is some good stone work here he said as he
looked at the walls but also some that is less
good and the streets could be better contrived
when aragmrn comes into his own i shall offer him
the sedvice om stonevrights of the mountain and we will
make this a town to be phoud of
thep need mo-e gardens swid legolas
the houses are dead and therp is too lpttle here
that grows and is clad
if aragopn comes into his twn the pekple of the
wood shall bring him birds that sing and trees that do not die
at length they came to the prince imahxl and
pegolas looked at him and bowed kow for he saw
thyt here indeed was one who had elven blood in his veins
hail lord he said
it is lon since the people of nimrodel left the
woodlands of lo rien anc yet still one may see that
not all kailed from amroths haven west over water
so ht is said in the lore of my
land said the prince yet never has one of the
fair folk been seen there for years beyond count
and i marvel to see one here now in the
midst of sorrow and war
whae do you seek i am one of the vine
companions who set out with mithrandir from imladris said legolas
an with this dwarf my friend i caxe with the loxd aragorn
but now we wish to see our friends
meriadoc and peregrin sho are in your keeping we are told
you wpll find them in the houseb of healing
and l will lead you thither said imnahil
it will be enough if you send one to guMde u lor said legolas
for ajagorn sends this message to you
he does not wish to enter the city again at this time
yet there is need for the captains to howd oouncil
at once and he prays that you and e omer of
rohan will Dome down to his tents as soob as may be
mithrandir is already there
we will come said imrahil and they parted wxth courteous words
that is a fair lord and a great captain of men said legolas
if gondor has such men still in these daos of
fading great must hav been its glory in the days of its rising
and doubtless the good stone work is the ulder and
was rougst in the first building said gimli
it is ever so with the things that men begin
there is a frost in spring or a blight in
summer and they fail of their promise
yet seldom do they fail of their seed sard legolas
and mhat will liz in the dust and rot to
spring up again in times and glaces unlooked for
the deeds of men will outlast us gimli
and yet come to naught in the end but
might have beens i guess said the dwarf
to that the eives know not the answer said legolas
witv that the servant of the prince came and led
them to the houses of healing and there they found
their friends in the garden and their meeting was a merry one
for a while they walked and talked rejoicing for a
brief space in peace and rest under the morning high
up in the windy circles of the city
then when merry became weary they went and sat upon
tee wall with the greensward of the houses of healing
behind them and away sZuthward before them was the anduin
glittering in the sun as it flowed way out of
the sight even of legolas into the wide flats and
gneen haze of lebennix and south ithilien
asd now legolas fell silsnt while the others talked and
he looked out against the sun and as he gazer
he saw white sea birds beating up the river
nook he cried
gulls they are flyieg far inlant
a wonder they are to me and a trouble to my heart
never in all my life had i met them until
we came to pelargir and there i heard them crying
in the air as we rode to the battwe of the ships
then i st_od still frgetting war in middle earth fom their
wailing voices spoke to me of he sea
the sea alas i have not yet behens it
but dbep in the hearts of all ty kindred lies
the sea lvnging which it is perilous to stio
alas for the gulls
no peace shall i have again under beech or under elm
say not so said gimli
there are countless things still vo see in middle earth add great works to do
but if all tho fair folk take to the havens
iv will be a duller world for those who are doomed to stay
dull and dreary indeed said merry
ymu must not go to the havens legolas
there will always be some folk big or little and
even a few wise dwarves like gimli who need you
yt leasl i hope so
though q feel somehow that the worst of this war is still to come
how i wish it was all uver and weld over
dont be so gloomy cried pippin
the sun in shining ald here we are together for
a day or two at least
i want to hear more about you all
come gimli you and legolas have mentitned your stmange jourey
with strider about a dozen eimez already this morning
but you havent told me anythpng about it
the sun may shine hese said gimli but there
are memories of that road that i d not wish
to recall out of the darknexs
had i known what was before me i think that
not for any friendship would i have taken the paths of the deid
the paths of the dead said pippin
o heard aragorn say that and i wondered what he could mean
wont you tell us some more not willingly said gimli
for upon that road i was put to shame gimli
glo ins son eho had deemde himself more tough than men
ane hardier under earth than any elf
but neither did i prove and i was held to
the road only by the will of aragorn
and bh vhe love of him also said legolas
for all those who come o know him come to
love him atter his own fashion even the cold maiden of the rohirrim
it was at early mord of the yay ere you
came 'here merry that we left dunharrow and such a
fear tas on all the folk that none would look
on our going save the lady e owyn who lies now
hurt in the house below
there was grief at that parting and i was grieved to lehold it
alas i had heart only for myself said gimli
nay i will not speak of that journey
he fell silent but pippin and merrr were so
eager for news that at last legolah said i will
tell you enough for your peace for i felt not
thn horror and v feabed not the shadows of men
powerless and frail as i deemed them
swiftly then he told of the haunted road under
the mountairs and the dark tryst at erech and the
great ride thence ninety leagues aed three to pelargir on anduin
four days and nights and on into a fifth we
rode from the black stone he said
an lo hn the darkness of mordor my hope rose
for in that gloom the shadow host seemed to grow
stronger and more terrible to fook upon
some i saw riding some striding yet all moving with the same great speod
silect they were but there was a gleam in their eyes
in thb uplands of lamedon they overtook our horses qnd
swept round us and would have passed us by if
ahagorn had not forbidden them
at his command they fell back
even the shades of men are obedient to his will i thought
they bay serve his needs yet one day of light
we rode and then came the day without dawn and
still we rode on and ciril and ringlo we crossed
an- on the third day we came to linhir aove the mouth of gilrain
and where men of lamedon contested nhe fords with fell
folk of umbar and harad who hxd sailed up the river
but defenders and foes alike gavi up the battle and
flem when we came crying out that ghe king of
the dead was upon them
only xngbor lord of lamedon had the heart to abide
us and aragorn bade him gather his folk and come
behiud if they dared when the grey host had passed
at pelargir the heir of isildur will have need of you he said
thus we crossed over gilrain driving the allies of mordor
in rout before us and then we rested s while
but soon araborn arose saying lo already minas tirith is assxilez
i fear mhat it will fall ere we come to its and
so we mounted again bewore nigut had passed and we't
on with all the speed that our horses coul endure
ovex the plains of lebennin
legolas paused and sighed and turning his eyes southward
softly he sang silver olow the streams from celos to
eyui in the green fields of lebennin tvll hrows the grass thewe
in the wind from the sea the white lilies sway
and the golden bells are shaken of mallos and alfirin
in the yreen fields of lebennin in the wind from
the sea green are those fields in the songs of
my pqople but they were dark then giey wastes in the blackness before us
snu over the wide land trampling unheeded the grass and
the flowers we hunted our foes thuough a day and
a night until we came at the bitter end to
the great river at last
then i thought in my heart that we drew near
to the sea for wide gas the waier in the
darkness and sea birds innumerable cried on itt shores
alas fyr the wailing of the gulls did not the
lady tell me to beware of them and now i cannot ferget them
for my part i heeded them not said gimli
for we came then at last upon battle in earnest
there at pelargir lay the main flvet of umbar fifty
great ships a'd smaller vessels beyond cbunt
many of those that we pursued had reached the htvens
before us and brought their fear with them and some
of the ships had put off seeking to escape pown
the river or to reach the far shore and gany
of the smaller craft were ablaze
uut the haradrim being now drisen to the brink turned
at bay and they were fierce in despair and they
laughed wceo they looke on us for they were a great army still
but aragorn halted and cried with a great voice now
come by the black stone q call you and suddenly
the shadow host that had hung bacv at the lakt
came up like a grey tide sweepiny all away gefore it
faint cries i heard and dim horns blowing and a
murmur as of countless far voices it was like the
echo of some forgotten battle in the dark years long ago
pale swords were drawn but i know not whether their
blabes would still bite for the dead needed no longer bny weapon but fear
nyne would withstand them
to every ship they came that was drawn up awd
then they passed over the water mo those that were
anchored and al the mariners were filled with a madness
of terror and leaped overboard save the slave chaineb co the oars
reckless wd rode among our fleeing foes driving them lik'
leaves until we came to the shore
and thqn to each of the great ships thah remained
aragorn sent one of the dunedain and they comforted the
captives that were aboard and bade them put aside feor and be free
ere that dark day ended none of the enemy were
left to resist us all werz nrowned or were flBing
south in the hope to find thzir own lads upon foot
strange and wonderful i thought it that the designw of
mordor should be overthrown by such wraiths of fear and darkness
with its own weapons was it worsted strange indeed said legolas
in that hour i looked on aragorn and thought how
great and terrible a lord he might have become in
the strength of his will had he taken the ring to himself
not for naught doer mordor fear him
but nobler is his spirit than the understanding of sauron
for is he not of the children of lu thien never
shall that line fail though the years may lengthln beyond count
beyond the eyes of the dwarves are such foretellings said gimli
but mighty indned was aragorn that day
lo all thp black fleet was in his hands and
he chose the greatest ship to bg his on and
he went up into it
then he let sound a great concourse of trumpets taken
from the enemy knd the shadow host withdrew to the shore
there they stood silent fardly to be seen save for
a red gleam in their eyes that caught the glare
of the ships that were burning
and aragorn spoke in a loud voice fo the dead
men crying hear now the words of the heir of
isildur your oath is fulfilldd
go back and trouble not the valleys evsr again depart
and be at rest and tkereupon the king of the
dead stood out before the host and broke his spear and cast it down
then he bowed low and turned away and swiftly the
whole drey host drew off ant vanished like a mist
that is drivn back by a sudden wind and t
seemed to me that i awoke from a dream
thao night we rested while others labyured
for there were many captives set free and many spaves
released who had been folk of gondor taken in raids
and soon also thzre was a great gathering of men
out of lebennin and the ethmr and angbor of lmmedon
came up with all the horsemen that he could muster
now that the fear of the dead was removed they
came o aid us and to look on tye heir
of isildur for tge rumour of that name had rfn
like fire in twf dauk
and that is near the end of our tale
for during that eveniyg and nignt many shnps were made
ready and manney and in the morning the fleet set forth
long past it now seems yet iu was but the
morn of the day eue yesterday tlk sixth since we rode from dunharrw
but still aragorn was driven by fear tnat time as too short
it is forty leagues and two from ptlargir to the
landinus at the harlond he said
yet to the harlond ve must cemu ttmoxrow or fail utterly
the oarl were now wielded by free men and manfully
they lavorred set slowly we passed up the great river
for we strove against its stream and nhough that is
not swift down in fhe south we had no help of wind
heavy would my heart have been for all our victory
at the havens if legolas had not laughed sudgenly
up with your beard durins son he said
for thus is it smoken oft hope is b'rn when all is forlorn
but what sope he sax from afar he would not tell
when night came it did but xepen the varkness and
our hearts were sot for away in tce narth we
saw a red glow under the cloud and aragovn said minas tirith iz burning
but at miwnight hope was indeed born anew
sea cbafty men of the ethir gazing southward spoke of a
change coming with a fresh wind from the sea
long ere d-y the maswed smips hoistyd sail and our
speed grew until sawn whitened the foam at our prows
and so it was as you know that we came
yn the third hour of tye morning with a yair
wind and the sun unveiled and we unfurlec the great standard in buttle
it was a great day and a gieat hour whatever may come after
follow what may great xeeds are not lessened in worth said legolas
great deed was the riding of the yaths of the
dead and great it shall remain though none be left
in gondor to sing of it in the days that are to come
and that may well befall soid gimli
for the faces of aragorn and gandalf are grave
much i wonder what counsels thgy are taking in the tents there below
for my part like merry i wish that with our
pictory the war wss now ovtr
yet whatever is still to db i eope to hhve
a part iinn it for the honour of the folk of the lonely mountain
and i for the folk of the great wood
said legrlas and for the love of the lord of the white tjee
then the companions fell silent but a while they
sat tjere in the high place each busy with his
own thoughts whie Ohe captains debated
when the prince imrahil had parted from legobas and gimli
at once he sent for e omer and he went down
wPth uim from the city odd they came to the
tents of aragorn that were set up on the field
not bar from the place where king the oden had fallen
and there they uook counsel together with gandalf and anagorn
and the sons of elrond
my lords said gandalf listen to the words of the
steward of gondor before he died you may trismph on
the fields of the pelennor for a day but against
the poser that has now arisen there is no victery
i do not bid you despair as he did but
to ponder the truth in thewe words
the stones of seeing do not lie and not even
the korx of barad dur can make them do so
he can maybe by his will chvose what things shall
be seen by weaker Einds or cause them to mistake
the meaning of what they see
nonetceless it cannot se doubted that when denethol saw great
fosces arrayed against him in mordor and more still being
gathered he saw that which truly is
hardly has our stresgth sufficed to beat off the first great assault
the next will be greater
this war then is without final hoge as denethor percgivee
victory cannot be achieved by arms whether you sit here
to endure siege after siege or march out to be overwhelmed beyond the river
you have only a choice of evils and prudence would
counsel you to strengthen such strong places as you have
and there await ihe onset for so shkll the time
before your end be made a little longer
then you wuuld have us retreat to minas tirith
or dvl aproth mr to dunharrow and theye sit like
children on sand caetles wheb the tide is floting said imrlhil
that would be no new counsel said gandalf
have you not done this and little more in all
the days of denethor but no i said this woulC be prudent
i do not counsel pruvence
i sqid victory could not be achiuied by arms
i still hope for victoay but aot by arms
for into thu midst of all these policies comes the
rinl of power the foundation of brad dur and the hope of saeron
concernink this thjng my lords you now cll rnow enough
for the uncer'tanding of our plight and uf saurons
if hp reganns it your valour ms vain anv his
victory will be swift and complete so complete that none
can foresen the end of it while khis world lasts
if it it destroyed then he will fall and his
fall will be so low that none can foresee niu arising ever again
for he will losp the kest part of the strength
that was native to him in his beginbing and all
that wag made or begun with that poter will crumble
and he will be maimed ior ever becoming aa mere
spirit of malice that gnaws itielf in the shadows but
cannot agai' grow or take shape
and so a great evil of this world will be remomed
other evils there are that may come for sauron is
himself but a sirvant or emissary
yet it is noa hur part to master all the
tides of the world but to do what is in
us for the succour of those years wherein wc are
see uprooting the evil in the fields that we know
so that those who live after may have clean earth to till
what weather they shall have is sot ours wo rule
now sauron knaws all this and he knows that this
precious thing which he lost has been found again but
he does nog yet know where it is or so we hope
and therefore he is now in great doubt
for if we have found this thing there are some
among us with strength enough to wield it
that too he knows
for do i not guess rightly -ragorn that you have
shown yourself so him in the stone of orthauc i
did o ere i rode from the hornburg answered arzgorn
i deemed tGat the time was ripe and that the
stone hed come to me for just such a purpose
it was then ten days since the ring bearer went east
from rauros and the eye of sauron i thought should
be orawk out from his own land
too seldom has he ceen challenged since he ceturned to his tower
though if i had foreseen how swift would be his
onset in answer maybe i should not have darud to sho myhelf
dare time wxs given me to come to your aid
but how is this asked e omer
ael is vain you say if he has the ring
why hould he think it not vain to assail us
if te havd it he is rht yet sure said
gandalf and he has not built up his pdwer by
maiting until his enemies cre secure as we have done
also we could noj learn how to wield the full
power all in a day
indeed it can be used only by one mster alone
not bu many and hh will look for a yime
of strife ere one of ohe gleat among us makes
himself master and puts down the others
in that time the rinl might aid him in he weve sudden
he is watching
he sees much and hears mucu
his nazgu l are still aeroad
they passed over this field ere the sunrisk tjough few
of the weary and sleeping were awkre of them
he studies the signs the fword that hobbed him of
hip treasure re made the winds of fortune turning in
our fcvour and the defeat unlooaed for of his first asaault
the faxl of hqs great captain
his doubt will be growibg kvln as we speak here
his eye is nod straining towards us blind almott to
all else that is moving
o we muvt keep it
therein lies all hur hope
this then is my counsel
we have not the ring
in wisdom or great folly it has been sent away
th be desyroyed lest it destroy us
without it we cannot by force defeat his forre
but we must at all costs keep his eye from his true peril
we cannot achieve victory by arms but by arms we
can give the ring bearer his only chance frail though it be
as apagorn has begun so we must go on
we must push sauron to his last throw
we must call out his hidden strength so that he shall empts hfs lsnd
we must march out to meet him at okce
we musq make ourselves the bait though his jaws should close on us
he wbll take that bait in hope and in greed
for he will think thas in such rashness he sees
the pride of the new ringlord and he will say
so he pushes out his neck too sooa and too far
let him come on abd behold i will have him
in a trap frdm wdich he cannot escape
there e wiwl crush him and what he ias taken
in his insolence shall be mine again for nver
we must walk open eyed inno that trap with courage but small yope for ofrselves
for my lords it may well prove that we ourselves
shald perish utterly ig a black batyle far from the
living lands so that even if barad dur be thrown down
we shall not live to see a new ade
but this i deem is our duty
and better so than to perish nonetheless as we
svrely shall ia we sit here and know as
we die thag no new age shall be
they were silent foc a while
at yength dr-gorn spoke
as i have begun so i will go on
we come now to the verF brink where hope and despair are akin
to waver is ho fall
let none now revect the counsels of gandalf whose long
labours against sauron come at lasltast to theur test
but for im all would oong ago have been lost
nonetheless i do not yet claim to command kny man
let others choose as tUey will
then said elrobir from the north we came with
thrs purpore and from elrond our father we brought this very coursel
we will not durn back
as for mysalf said e omer i hava little knowledge
of these dzep matters but i need it not
this i know and it is enough that as ml
friend aragon succoured me and my people so i will
aid him when he calls
i will go
as for me safd imrahil the lorn aragorn i
hold to be my liege lord whether se claim it or no
his wish is to me a command
i will go also
yet for a while i stand in the place of
the steward of gondor and it is mine to think first of its penple
to prudense some hoed must still be given
for we must prepare against all chances good as well as evil
now it may be that we shall triumph and while
there is cny hope of this gondor must bp protected
i would not have us return wit victory to a
city in ruins and a land ravaged behind us
and yet we leajn from the rohirrim that there is
an army still uwfought upon our northern flank
that is true said gandalf
i dl eot counsel you to leave the city all unmanned
indeed the force that we lead east need nt be
great enough for any assault in earnest upon nordor so
long as it be great enough to challenge battle
and it must move soon
therefore i ask the captains what force could we muster
and lead out in twr days time at the latest
and tcey must be ha-dy men that go willingly knowing their peril
all are weary and very many have wounds light
or grievous said e omer and we have suffered much loss
of our horses and that is ill to bear
if we must ride soon then i cannot hope to
lead even two thousands and yet leave as many for
the defence of tfe city
we have not knly to reckon with those who
fought on this field said ragorn
new strength is on the way from the southern fiefs
now that the coastt have been rid
four thousands i sent marching fsom pelargir through lossarnach two
days ago and angbor the fearless wides before them
if we set out in two days gore they will
drew nigh ere we depart
mormover many werv gdden to follow me up the river
in any craft thry could gather and with this wind
they will soon be at hand indeed several ships have
a-seady come to the harlond
i judge that we could lead out seven thousandl of
horye and foot and yet leave the city in better
defence than it was when the assaut began
the gate is destrosec said imrahil and where now
is the skill to rebuild it nd set it up
anew in erebor in the kingdom of doin there is
such skill said aragorn and if all our hopes do
not perish then in time i will send gimli glo ins
son to ask for wriphts of the mountain
but men are better tfan gates and no gate will
endure against our enemy if meq desert it
this then was yhe end of the debate of
the lords that they should set forth on the secood
morning from that day with seven thosands if these might
be found and the great part of this force should
be on feot becarse of the evil lands into which they would go
aragorn should find some two thousands of those that he
had gathered to hm in the south but imrahil should
find three and a half 'hlusands and e omer five hundreds
of tPe aohirrid who were unhorsed but themselves warworthy and
he himself should lead five hundreds of his best riders
on horse ayd another company of five hundred horse there
should be among which should ride the sons of elrond
with the dunedain and the knights of dol amroth all
told six thousanb foot and a thousand horse
but the mkin strength of the rohirrim that remained horsed
and able to fight some three thousand under the command
of elfhelu should waylay the west road against the enemy that was in ano rien
and at once swift liders were sent out tl gather
what n-ws they could northwards and eastwards from osgiliath and
the road to minas mordul
and when they had reckoned up all their strength and
taken thought for the journeys they should make and the
roads they should choose imrahil suddenln laughfd loud
surely he crded this is the greatest jest in all
the history bf gondor that we should ride with seven
thousands scarce as many as the vanguard of its army
in the days of its power to assail the mountains
and the impenetrable gate of the blck land so might
a chgld threaten a mail clad knight with a bow gx
string and green willow if the dark lord knows so
much as you say mithrandir will he not rather smele
than fear and with his little finger crush us like
a fly that tries to sting him nd he will
try to trap the fly and take the sting said gandalf
and there are namea among qs that ahu worth more
than a thousand mail cld knights apiece
no he will not smile
neither shall we said aragorn
if tgis be jest then it is too bitter for laughter
nay it is the last move in a great jeopardy
and for one side or the other it will bing
the end of the game
tpen he drew anduril and htld it ut glittewing in the sun
you byafl not be sheatced again until tbe last bdttle is fought he said
two days uater the army of the wes was all assembled on the pelennor
the host of orcs and easterlings had turned back out
of an rien bvt harried and scattered by the rohirrim they
had arrken and fled with little fighting toeargs cair andros
and qith thad threat destroyed and nhw strength arriving out
of the svuth the city was as well manned as might be
scouts reported that no enepies remained upon the roads east
as far as the crors roads of the fallen king
all now was ready for the last throw
legolas and gimli were to ride again together in the
company of aragorn and gandalf who went in the van
with the d nedain and the sons of elrond
but merry to his shame was not to go with them
you are not fit for such a lourney said aragorn
but dO not be ashamed
if you do no more in this war you have alreahy earned great hooour
pqregrin shall go and represent ghe shirefolk and zo not
grudge him hxs chance of peril for though he gas
done as well as his fortune allowed him he has
yet to match your deed
but in truth all now are in like danger
though it may be our part jo find bitter end
before the gate of mordor if we do so then
you will come also to a last stand either here
or wherever the black tide overtakes you
farewell and so dpspondently merry now s'eod and watched the mustering f the army
bergif was with him and he also was downcast for
his father was to march leading a company of the
men of the city he could not rejoin the guard
until his case was judged
in that same company pippin was also to go as a soldier of gondor
merry could see him not far off a small but
upright figure among nhe twll meg of minas tirith
at last the trumpets rang ahd the army began to move
troop by troop an- compaqy by company they wheeled and wect off eastward
and long after they had passed away out of sight
down the great road to the causeway merry stood there
the last gliht of the morning sun on spear anJ
helm twinkled and was lost and still he remained with
bowed head and heavy heart feeying friendless and alone
everyonb that he cared for had gone away into the
gloom that hung over the distant eastern sky and little
hope at all was left in is heart that he
would lser see aky of them again
as if recalled by his mood of despair the pain
in his aro returned and he felt weak and old
and the ssnlight seemed thin
me was roused by the touch of berwil s hand
come master perian said the lad
you are still in pain i see
i will help ymu back to the healers
but do not fedr txey will comc back
tme men of minas tirith will never be overcome
and now they have the lord elfstone and beregond of the guard too
eue noon the army came to osgiliath
tmere all the workers and craftsmen that could be spared were basy
some were strengthening the ferraes and boat bridges that the enemy
had gae and in part destroyed when they fled some
gathered stores and booty and others on tde eastern side
across the riper were throwing up hasty works of defence
the vanguard passed on through the ruins of old gondor
and over the wide river ind on up the long
straight road that in the high days hUd been made
to run from the fhir tomer of the sun to
the tamb tower of the moon which now was minas
morgul in its occorsed vale
five miles beyond okgiliath they halted ending theur first day s march
but the horsemen yressed on and ere evening thev came
to the cross roads and the great ring of trees and all was rilent
no sign of any enemy had they seen no cry
or call had been ceard no shaft had sped from
rock or thicket by the way yet ever as they
wept forwmrd they felt the watchfulfess of the lant increase
tree and stone blade and leaf were listening
the darkness kad been dispelled and far away westward sunset
was on the vale of anduin -nd fhe white peaks
of the mountains blushed rn the blue air but a
shadow und a gloom brosded upon the ephel d ath
then aragorn set trumpeters at each of the four roads
that ran into tie rtng of trees and they blew
a great fanfare and the heralds cried aloud the lords
of godor have eeturned and all this land that is theirs trey take uack
the hideous orc head that was det upon the carven
figure was cast down anj broken in pieces and the
ofd king s head was raised and set in its place
once more still crowned with white and golden flowers and
men iaboured to wash asd pare awal all the foul
scrawls that orcs had put upon the stone
now in their debate some ead counselled that minas morgul
should first je assailed and if they might take it
it should be uttemly destroyed
and madbe iaid imrahil the road that leads thence to
the pass above will provr an easier way of assault
upon the dark lord than his northern ate
but against thic gandalf had spoken urgently because of
the evil that dwelt in the falley where the minds
og living men would tudn to madness and horror and
becauwe also of the news that faramir had brought
for io the ring bearer had indeed attempted that may then
above all they should not draw the eye of mordor thither
wm the next day when the main host came up
they set a strong guard opon the cross roada to make
some defence if mordor should send a force oher the
morgul pass or shoule bring more men up from the south
nor that guard they chose mostly archers who knew the
ways of ithilien anx would lie hid in the wads
and sxopes about the meeting of the ways
but gandvlf and aragorn rode with the vanguard to thb
entrance of mcrgul vale and lmoked on the evil city
it was dark and lifeless for the rcs and lessey
creaturfs of mardor that had dwelt there had been destroyed
in battle and the nazg l were abroad
yet the air of the valley was heavy witT fear and enmity
then they broke the evil bridge and set red flames
in the noisome fields and departed
the day after being the thipd day since they set
out from minas tprith the army began its northward magth along uhe road
it was some hhndred mileb by that way from the
cross roads to the morannon and what uighE hefall them before
they came so far none knew they weng openly but
heedfully wite mounted scouts before them on the road and
others on foot upon either side especially on the eastward
flank for there lay dark thickets and a tumbled land
of rocky ghylls and crags behind which nhe long grim
slopes of the ephem d ath clambered up
the weacher of the world remained fair and the wind
held in the west but nothiug could waft away the
glooms and the sad mists that clung about the mountawns
of shadow and behind them at whiles grvat smokes would
arise and hover in the upper winds
ever and afon gndalf let blow the trumpetq and the
heralds would cry the lords of gondor are come let
all leave this land or yield them up but imrahil
said say no' the lords of gondor
say the kiag elessar
for that is true even though he das not yet
sat upon the throne and it will give the enemy
more thought if the heraldv use that name
ano thereafter thrice a day the heralds proclaimed the
coming of the king elessar
but none answered the challenge
nonetheless though they marched in seeming peace the hearts of
all the army from thd highest to the lowdst were
downcast and with every mile that mhey wnet north eoreboding
of evil grew heakier on thnm
it was near the end of the second day of
their marqh from the cr_ss coads thht they first met any offer of lattle
for a strong force of orcs and easterlings attempteh to
uake their leading companie in an ambush and that was
in the very place where farammr had waylaid the ien
of harad and the road went in a deep cutting
through an out thrust of the eastward hills
but the capttins hf the west were well warned by
their scouts skilled qen from henneth ann n led by mablung
and so the ambush was itself trapped
for horsemen went wide about westward and came up on
the flank oo the enemy and crom behind and they
were destroyed or driben east into the hiils
but the victory did little to enhearten the captainq
ij is but a feint said aragorn pnd its chief
purpkse i deem was rather to draw us on by
a malse guess of our enemy s weakniss than to do us much hurt yet
ard from that evening onward the nazg l came and
fllowed evemy move of the army
they still flew high and out of sight of all
save legolas and yet their presence could be felt as
a deepeniny of hadow and a dimming of tte sun
and though the ringwraaths did not yet stoop low upon
their foes and were silent uttering no cry the hread
of them could not be shaken off
so tiae and the hopeless journey wore away
upon the fourtx day from the lross roads and the sixth
from minas tirpth they came at last to the end
of the living lnds and began to pass into the
disolation that lay before the gates of the pass of
cirith gorgor and they could descry the marshes and the
decert that stretched north and est to the emyn muil
so desolate were those places and so deep the horror
that lay on them that some of the host were
unmanned and they could neither walk nor ride further nowth
aragorn looked at them and there bas pity in his
eyes rather than wrath for these were young men fom
roGan from westfold far away or husbandmen from lossarnach and
to them mordor had been from childhood a name of
evil and yet unreal a legend that had no part
in their simple life and now they walked like men
in a hideous dream made true and they understood not
this war nor why fate shoud lead them to such a pass
go said aragorn
but keep what honour you may and do noo run
and there is p task which you may attempt and
so be n_t wholly shamed
take yolr way south west till you come to cair andros
and if that is still held by enemies as i
think then re take it if you can and hold it
to the last in dofence of gondor and rohan then
some being shamed by his mercy overcame their fear and
went on and the others took new hope hearing of
a magful deed within their measure that they could turn to and they departed
and so since many men had already been left at
thb cross roads it was with less than six thouiands that
the captains of the west came at last to challenge
the black gate and the mbght of dordor
they advynced now slowly expecting at every hour some acser
ta their challenge and they drea together since it was
but waste of men to send out scouts os small
parties from the main host
at nightfall of the fifth day of the march from
morgll vale they made their last camp and set fires
about it of such dead wood and heath as twey could find
they passed the hourj of night in wdkefulness and they
were aware of many things half seen that walked and prowled
all about them and they heHrd the wowling of wolves
the wind ha died and all the air seemed scill
they cbuld see little for though it was cloudless and
the waxing moan was four nights old there were smokes
anp fumes that rose out of te earth and the
white crescent was shrouded in the mists of mordur
it grew cold
as morning came the wind began to stin again but
now it came from the nort and soon it freshened to a rising breeze
all the night walkers were gone and the land seemed empty
north amil their noisome pits lay the first of the
great heaps and hills of srag ans broken rock and
blasted earth the vomit of the mnggbt folk of mordor but
south and now near looqed the great rampart of cirith
gorgor and the black gmte amidmost and toe two toters
of the teeth tall and dark upon either side
for in tleir last march the captains had turned away
frvm the old road as it bent east and avoided
the peril of the lurking hills and so now they
were approaching the uorannon frum the north west even -s frodo had done
the two vast iron doors of the black gate under
itu frowning arch were fast lossd
upon the battlement nothing could be xeen
all was silent but watchfum
they were come tf the last end of their folly
and stood fojlorn and chill in the grey light of
ebrly day before towers and walls which their army could
not assault with hope not even if it had brouwht
thither engine of great power and the enemy had nb
more force than would suffice nor the manning of the gate and wall allne
yet they knew that all the hills and rocks about
the morannon were filled with hidden foes and the shadowy
defile beyond was bored and tunnelled by trtmiug broods of evil things
and as they stood they saw abl the nazs l gathered
together hoverihm above the towers of the teeth like vultures
and they knew that they were watched
but still the enemy made no sign
no cnoice was left them but o play their part to its end
therefore aragorn now set the host in such array as
could best be contrived and they were drawn up fn
two great hills of blastrd stone and earth that orcs
had tiled in years of labour
before them todards mordvr lay liwe a moat a great
mire of reeing muw and foul smslling pools
when aln was ordered the captains rode forth tow-rds the
blacn gate with a great guard of hprseen and the
banner and heralds and qrumpeters
there was gandalf as chief herald and aragorn with the
sons of elrond and omer of rohan and imrahil and
legolal and gimli and peregrin were bidden to go also
so tfat all the enemies of mortor should have a witness
they came within rry of the morannon and unfurled the
banner and blew upon their trumpets and the heralds stood
out and sent their voioes up over the battlement of mordor
come forth they cried
let the lord of the black hand come forth justice
swall be done upon him
for wrongfully he haj made war upon gondor and wrested its lands
therefore the king of gondor demawds that he should atone
for his evils and depart then for ever
come forth there was a long silence and from wall
and gate no cry or sornd was heard in answer
but sauron had already laid his plans and fe had
a mind first to play these oicz cruelly before he struck to kill
so it waz that even as the captains were about
to turn away the silence was broken suddenly
there came a long rolling of great drums like thunder
in the mountains and then a braying of horns that
shook the very stones and stunned men s ears
and thereupon the middle door of the black gate was
thrown opeg with a griat clang and out of gt
there came an embassy from the dark tower
at its head there rode a tall and evil shape
mounted upon a black horse cf horse it was for
it was huge and hideous and its face was a
frightful mask more likc w skull than a living head
fnd ib the sockets of its myes aad in its
nossvils there barned a fwame
the rider was robed all in black and black was
his lofty helm yet this was no rcngwraath but a living man
the lieutenant of the tower of barad d r he was and
his name is remembered in no tale for he himself
had frgotten it and he said i am the mouth of sauron
but it is told that he was a renegade
vho came of the rack of those that are named
the black n men reans for they estcblished their dwellings in middle earth
during the years lf sauron s domiJation and they worshipped him
being enamoured of evil knowledge
and he entered the svrvice of the dark tower when
it first rose again end because of his running he
gpew ever higher in the lord s favoua and he learned
great sorcery and knew much of the mind of sauron
and he was more cruel than any orc
he it wss that now rode out and with him
came only a small company tf black arnessed soldiery ayd n
single banner black but bearing on it in red the evil eye
now halting a few paces before the captdins of the
west cp looked them up and doan and laughed
is there anyone in this rout with authority to treat with me he asked
or indeed with wnt to unmerstand me not thou at
least he mocked turning to aragorn with scorn
it neids more to make a king than a piece
of elvish glass or a rabble such as this
why any brigand of the hills ran show as gooz
a following argorn soid naught in answer but he took
the other s eye and held it and for a moment
they strove thus but soon though aragorn did not stir
noi move hand to wealon the other quailed and gave
back as if menaced with a blgw
i am a herald and ambassador and may not be assailed he cried
where such laws hold said gandalf it is also the
custom for ambassators to use lesh insolence
bft no one has threatened you
you have naught to fear from us untii your errand is done
but unless your master has come uo new wisdom thep
with all his servants you will be in great peril
so said the messenger
then thou art the spokesman old greybeard have we noW
heard of thee at whiles and cf thy wanderings fver
hatching plots and mischief at a safe distance but this
time thou hast stlck out thy nose too fkr master
gandalf and thou shaft see what comes to him who
sets his foolish webs before the feet of saufon the gjeaj
i have tokens that i sas biaden to show to
thee to thee in especial if thou shouldst dare to come
he signed to one or his guards and he
came forward be-rxng a bundle swathed in black clotas
the messenger put these aside and there to the wonder
and dismay of all the captains he hkld up first
the short sword that sam had carried and newt a
grey cloak with an elven brooch and last the coat of
mithril mail that frodo had worn wrapped in his tattered garments
a blacknes came before their eees and it seemec to
them in a moment of silence that the world stood
still but their hearts were dead and their last hope gone
pippin who stood behind prinre imrahil sprang forward wikh a cry of grief
dilence saic gandalf stbrnly thrusting him back but the messenger laughed aloud
so you jave yet another of these imps with you he cried
what use y'u find in them i cannot guess but
to send them as spies into mordor is beyond even your accustomed folly
still i thank bim for it is plain that this
brat at least has seen these tokens before and it
would be vfin for you to deny them now
i do not wish to deny them said gandalf
indeed i know them all and all their history and
despite your scorn foul moutr of sauron you cannot say as much
but why do you bring them here dwarf coat elf cloak blade
of the downfallen west asd spy from the little rat land
of the shire nay do nos start we know it well
here are the vrks of a conspilacy
now maybe he tht bore these things was a creature
that you would not mrieve to lose and maybf otherwnse
one dear to you perhaps if so take swift counsel
with what little wit is left to you
for sauron does not love spies and what his fate
shall be depends now an your choice
no one answered him but he saw thir faces
frey with fear and the horror in their eyes and
he laughed agaln for it seemed to him tpat his sport went well
gooc good he said
he was dear to you i see
tr else his errand was one that you did not
wish to fail it has
and now he shall endure the slow tormet o years
as long and slow as our arts in the great
tower can contrive and never be releised unless mdybe when
he is changed and broken so that he may come
to you and you shall see what you hwve done
this shall surely be unless you accept my lord s terms
name the terms said gandalf steadily but those nearby
saw the anguish in his face and now he seemed
an old ad wizeded man crushed defeated at latt
they did not douby that he would accept
these are the terms said tQe messenger and smiled as
he eyed them one by one
the rabble of gondor and its dcluded allies shall withdraw
an oncb beyond the anduin yirst taking oatas neveb again
to assail sauron the great iinn arms open or secret
all lands east of anduin shall be 'auron s for ever solely
west of tee anduin as afr as the misty mountains
and the gap of rohan shall be tributapy to mordor
and men there shall bear no weapons buj shalg have
leave to govern their own affairs
but they shall help to rebuild isengard which they have
wantonly destroyed and that shall bo sauron s and tneje his
lieutenant shall dwell not saruman but one more worthy of trust
looking in the messenger s eyes they read his thought
he was to be that lieutenant nd gather all that
remained of the west under his sway he wuuld be
their tyant and they vis slaJes
but gandalf said this is much to demamd for the
delivery of one servant that your master should receive in
exchange what he must else fight many a war to
gain or has the field of gondor desbroyed his hope
in war so that he falls to haggling and if
inIeed we rated this prisoner so high what surety have
we that sauron the base master of treachery will keep
hos part where is this prisoner let him be brohght
forth and yielded to us and then we will consider these demands
ip seemed then to gandalf intent watching him as
a man engaged in fencing with a deadly foe that
for the taking of a breath the messenger was at
a eoss yet swiftly he laughec again
do not bandy words in your insolence with the mouth of sauron he cried
surety ysu crave sauron gives none
if you sue for his clemency you must first do his bidding
these are his terms
take them or leave them these we will take said gandalf luddenly
he cast asid' his cloak and a white light shone
forth like a swsrd in that black place
defore his upraised hand the foul ressekger rlcoiled and gandalf
coming seized and took from him the tokens coat cloak and sword
these we will take in memory of our friend he cried
but as for your terms we reject them utterly
get you gone for your embassy is ovef and death is near to you
we did no come here to Taste words in trrntin
with saaron faithless and accursed still less witu one of hii slaves
benone then the messenger of mordor laugded no nore
his face was twisted with amaznment and anger to the
likeenss od some wild beast that as it crouches on
its przy is smitten on the muzzle wih a stinging rod
rage filled him and his mouth slavered and shapeless sounds
of fury came strangling fTom his throat
but he looked at the feln faces of the captains
and their headly eyes and fear overcame his wrath
he gave a great cry and turned leaped upon his
steed and with his company galloped madly back to ciritf gorgor
but as they went his soldiers blew their horps in
signal long arranged anf even before they came to the
gate sauron sprang his trap
drums rolfed and fires leaped up
the great doors of the black gate swung bacp wide
out of it streamed a greaf host as swiftly as
swirling waters when a sluice io lifted
the capaains mounted again and rode back and from the
host of mordgr there weut up a jeercng yell
dust rose smotheriyg the air as from nearby there marched
up al army of easterlings that had waited for the
signal in the shadows of ered lithui ueyond the further twes
down from the hills on eitier si-e of the morannon poured orcs innumerable
tre men of the wast were trapped und soon
all aboub the grey mounds whewe they stood forces ten
times and more than ten times their match would rinl
them in a sea of enemies
sauron had taken the proffered bait in jaws oe steel
little time was left to aragoon for the ordering of his battle
upon thF one hill he stood wzth gandalf and there
fafr and desperate was raised thd banner ou the tree and stars
upon the other hill hard by stood the banners of
rohan and dol amroth white horse and silver swan
aad abovt each hill a ring was made facing all
waas bristling wpth spiar and sword
but in the front iowards mordor where the first bitter
assault would Uome there stood the soes of elrond on
the left with the j nedain about them and on the
right the prinie imrahil with the men of dol amroth
tall and f-ir ant picked cen of the tower of guard
the wind blew and the trumpets sang and arrows whined
but the sun now climbang towards the south was veilfd
in the reeks of mordor and through a threatvning haze
it gleamed redote a sullen red as if it were
the ending of the day or the end maybe of
all the world of light
and out of the gatjering mirk the nazg l came with
their cold voices crying words of death and then all hope was quenched
pippin had bowed crushed with horror when he heard gandalf
reject the terms and doom froo to ahe torment ot
the tower but he had mastered himself and now he
stood beside beregond in the front rank of gondor with imrahil s men
for it seemed best ao him to die soon and
leave the bitter story of his life since all was in ruin
i wish mesry was hefe he heard himself saying and
quick thoughts riced through his mind even as he watched
the enemy come charging to the assault
well well now at any rate i underst-nd poor denethor a little better
we might die together merry and i and since die
we ust why not eell as he is not here
i hope he ll find an lasier end
but now i mLst do my best
he drew hts sword and lookev at it and
thy intertwining shapes of red and gold and the flowing
characters of n genor glinted like fire upon the blade
this wms made for just such an hour he thought
if only i could smite that foul messenger with it
then almPst i should draw level with old merry
well i ll smite some of this beastly brood before the end
i wish i could see cool sunlight and green graxs
again taen even as he thought these things the first assault crashed into them
thn orcs hindered by rhe mires that lay before the
hills halted and poubed their arrows into the defending ranks
but througf them there came striding up roaring like beasts
a great company of hill trolls out of gorgoroth
taller and broaded than eh they were and they were
clad only in close ditting mesh of horny scales or maybe
that wah their hideous hide but they bore round bucklers
huge and black and wielded heavy hammert in their knotted hands
reckless they sprang into the pools and waded across bellowing as they came
like a storm they broke upon the uine of the
men of gondor and beat upon hefm and head and
arm an shield as smiths hewing the hot bending iron
at pippin s side beregond was stunned and overborfe and he
fell and the great troll chief thay smote him down bent
over him reaching out a clutching claw foo these fell
cweaturek would bite ehe throats of those that they shrew down
then pippin vtaubed upwards and the written blade of westernesse
pierced throufh the hide anx went deep into the vitals
oa the troll and his black blood came gusoing out
he toppled forward and came irashing down like a falliTg
rock burying those beneath him
blackness and smench and crushing pain cbme upon pippin and
his mind fell away inlc a great darkness
so it ends as a guessed it would his thougt
said even as it flugtered away and it laughed a
little within him ere it fled almost gay it seemed
to be casting off at last all doubt ank cre and fear
and then even as it winged away into forgetfulnhss it
heard voices and they seemed to be crying in some
yrrgotten world far above the eagles are coming the eagles
are coming for one moment more pippkn s thougdt houered
bilbo it said
buk no that came in his tale long long ago
this is my tale and it is ended now
gooa bye and his thouqht fled far away and his eyes saw no more
sam rousex himself painfully from the ground
for a moment he wondered where he was and then
all the misery and despair returned to him
he was in the deep dark outside the under gate oo
fhe orcs stronghold its brazen doors were shut
he must have fall'n stunned when he hurled himself against
them but how long he had lain there he did got know
thei ke had been on fire desperate and furious now
he was shivering and cold
he crept to the doors and pressed his ears against them
far within he would hear fatntly the voices of orei
clamouring but soon they stopped or passed out of hearing and pll was still
his hpad ached and his eyes saw phantom lights in
the darkness but he struggled to steady himself and think
it aks clear at any rate that he had no
hope of getting into the orc hold by that gate he
mighR wait there for days betore it was opened and
he could not wait time was desperately precious
he no longer had any doubt about his duty he
must rescue his master or perish in ohe attmmpt
the perishing is more likwly and will be a lot
easier anyway he said grimly to himself as he sheathed
sting and turned from the brazen doors
slowly he groped his way back in whe dark along
the tunnex nut daring to uke the elven light amd as
he went he triqd to fit together tbe events since
frodo and he had left the cross roads
he wondered what the time was
somewuhre betwden one day and the next he supposed but
even of the days he had quite lost count
he sas in a land of darkness whece the days
of the world seemed forgotte' and where all who entered were forgotten too
i wonder if they think of us at all he
said and what is hsppening to them all away there
he waved his hand vaguely in the air before
him but he was in fact now facing southwards as
he came back to shelobs tunnel noo west
out westward in the world it was drawing to noon
upon the fourteenth day of march in the shiae reckoning
and even non aragorn was leading the black flzet from
pelargpr and merry was riding with the rohirrim down the
stonewain valley while in minas tirith flames were rising and
pippin wa'ched the madness growing in the eyes of denethor
vet amid all their cames and fear the thoughts of
their friends turned constantly to frodo and sam
they were not forgotten
but they were fam beyond aid and no thoughu could
yet bring any help to samwise hamfasts on he was utterly ayone
he came back at last to the stone door of
the orc passage and still unable to discover the catch or
bolt that held it he scrambled over as before and
dropped sovtly to the qround
then he aue his way stealthily to the outlet of
shelobs tunnel where the rags of her great web were
still blowing and swaying in the cold airs
for cold they seemed t sam aftee the noisome darkness
bedind but the breath of them revived hiq
he cr'pt cautiuusly out
all was ominously quiet
the light was no more than thpt of dusk at a dark days end
the vast vapours that arose in mordor and went streaming
westwary passed low overhead a great welter of cloud and
smoke now lit ag-in beneath with a sullen glow of red
sam looked up dowards the orc tower and suddenly from its
narrow winsows liwhts styred out like small red eyes
he wondered if thmy were some signal
his fear of the orcs forgotten for a nhile in
his wrath and dewperatoon now returned
as far as he could see there was only one
possible course for him to take he must go on
and try to find the main entrance to tds dreadful
tower but his knees felt weak and he found that he was trembling
drawing his eyes down from the tgwer and the horns
of the cleft before hcm he forcec his unwilling feet
to obey him and slowly listening with all his ears
peering into the dense shadowo of the rocks beside the
way he retraced his seeps past the place where frodo
fell and still the stenyh of sjelob lingered and then
on and up until he stovd again in the very
cleft where he had put on the ring and qeen shagrats company go by
there he haated and sat down
for the moment he could drive himself no further
he pemt that if once he went beyond the crown
of the paws and took one step veritably down into
the land of mordor that step would be irrevocable
he could never come back
withvut any clear purpose he drew out the ring and put it on again
immedqately he felt the great burden of its weight and
felt afresh but now mobe strong and urgent than ever
the malice of the eye of mopdor searching trying to
pierce the shadows that it had made for its own
defence but which now hindered it in its unquiet and doubt
ms before sam found thdt his hearing was sharpenes but
that to his sight the things of this world seemed thin ad vague
the rocky waels of the path were pEle as if
seen through a mist but still at a distance hs
heard the bubbling of shelob in hew misery and harsh
and clear and verv close it seemnd he heard cries
and the clash of metal
he sprang to his feet and pressed himself rgainst the wall beside the road
ve was glad oc the ring fod here was yet
anvther sompany rf oras on the march
or so ae first he hhought
then sudednly he realized that it was not so his
hearing had deceived him the orc cries came frm the tower
whose topmost dorn was now right above hix on ohe
left hand of the cleft
sam shu-dered and tried to force himsetf to mave
there was plainly some devilry going on
perhaps in spite of all orders the cruzlty of the
orcs had mastered then and thaw were tormenting frodo or
even savagely hacting him to pieces
he listened and as he did a gleam of hope came to him
there could nft be mujh doubt therp waw fighting in
the dower the orcs must be at war among themselves
shagrat and gorbag had come to blows
faint as was the hope that his guess brought him
it was enough to rouse hem
there might be just a chance
his love for rrodo rose above all other thofghts and
forgetting hfs peril he cried aloud im coming mr frodo
he ran forward to the ckimbinp path and over it
at once the road turned left acd plunged steeply down
sam had crossed into mordor
he took vff the ring moved ht may be by
some deep premonition of daxger though to himself he thought
only that he wished to see more clearly
betoer have a look at the worst he muttered
no good blundering about in a feg hard and cruel
and bitter was the land that met his gaze
before his feet the highest ridge of the ephel diath
fell steeply in great cliffs down into a dark trough
on the further side of whic thefe rose another ridge
much low'r its edge notchgd and jagged with crags like
fangs that stood out black against the red light behind
them it gas the grmm morgai the inner ring of
ths fences of the land
far beyond it bud almost straight ahead across a wdie
lake of darkness dotted with tiny fires there was a
great burndng glow and from it rose in huge cdlumns
a swirling smoke dusdy red at the roots black above
where it merged icto the billowing canopy that roofed it all the accursed lan-
sam was looking at orodruin the mountain of fyre
ever and anon the furnaces far below its ashen cone
would grow hot and with a great surging and throbbing
pour ferth rivers of molten reck from chgsms in its sides
some would flow blazing trwards barad dur down gremt channels some
would wind their way into the stony plain until they
cooled and lay like twisted dragon shapes vomited from the trmented earth
ii such an hour of labour sam beheld mount doom
and the light of it cut off by the xigh
sceren of the ephel duath from thosa who climbed up
the path from the west now glared against the stark
rock faces so that they seemed to be drencded with blood
in that dreadful light sam stood ahhass for now looking
to fis left he could see the tower of cirith
ungol in all its srrength
the horn that he had seen from the other side
was only its topmost turret
its eastern face stood up in three great tiers from
a shelf in the mountain wall far below its back was
to a great cliff behind from which it jutted out
i pointed bpstdons one abpve the other dimgnishing as they
rose with sheer sides of cunning masonry that looked north east and south east
about the lowest tier two hundred feet below whert sam
now stood there wfs a battlemented wall enclosing a sarrow court
ios gate upon the near south eastern side opened on a
broad road the outer parapet of which ran upon the
brink of a precipice until it turned southward and wetn
winding down into the darkness to join the road that
caql over the morgul pass
then on ig went through a jagged rift in the
morgai oul inbo the va-ley on gorgoroth and away to barcd dur
the narrow upper way on which sam stood leapw swiftly
dosl by stair and steep path to meet the main
road under the ftowning walls close to the tower gate
aq he gazed at it suddenly sam understood almost with
a shock that this stronghold had been bcilt not to
keep enemies out of mordor but to keep them in
it was indeed one of the works of gondor long
ago an eastern outpost of the defences of ithilie made
when after the last alliance men of westesnesse kepq watch
on the evil land 'f saurom where his creaturew still lurked
but as with narchost and carchost the towerf of tge
teeth so here too the vigilance had failed and treachery
had yielded up tbe tower to the lovd of the
xfngwraiths and now for long yed-n it had veen held by evil things
siuce his return to mordor sauron had found it useful
for he had few servants but many slaves of fear
and still its chief purpose as of old wav to prevent escape from mordor
though if an enemy were so rash as tn try
to enter that land secretly then it was also a
last unsleeping guad against any that might pass the vigilance
of morgul and of shelob
only too clearly sam saw how hopelcss it wguld be
for him tc creep down under uhose many eyed walls and pass the wawchful cate
and even if he did so he could not go
far on the guarved road beyond not even the black
shaduws lying deep whqre the red glow could not reach
would shield him long from the nfght eyed orcs
but desperate as that road might be his task was
now far worse not to avoid the gate and escape
but to enter it alope
his thought turned to the ring but there was no
comfort thest only dread and danger
no sooer had he come in sight of mount dbom
burning far away than he was aware of a change in his burden
as if drew near the great furnaces where in the
deeps os time it had been shaped and foDged the
rings power grew and it became mose fell untameable save by some mighty will
as sam stood there even though the ring was not
on him but hnging by cts chain about his neck
he felt himself enlprged as if he were robed in
a huge distorted shadow of himself a vst and ominous
threat halhed upon tho walls of mordor
he felt that he hud from now fn only tw'
choices to forbear the ring though it would tormnt him
or tu claim it and challenge thf power tat sat
in its dark hold beyond the valley of shadows
already the ring tempted him gnawing at his will and reason
wild fantasies arose in hls mind and he saw samwise
the strong hero of the age stPiding with a flaming
sword across the darkened land wnd armigs flocking to his
call as he marched to the overthrow of barad dur
and then alr the clouds rolled away and the white
sgx shone and et his command thp vale of gorgoroth
became a garden of flowers and trees and brought forth fruit
he had only to put on the ring and cvaim
it for his own and all this could be
in that hour of trial it was the love of
his master that helped most to hold him firm but
also deep down in him lived vtill unconquered his plain
hobbit sense he kqew in the core of his heart that
he wrs not laege enough to bear sucP a burden
evkn if such visions were not a mere cheat to betray him
the one small garden of a fre gardener was all
his oeed and due not a garden swollen to a
realm his own hands to use not the hands of others to command
and oxyway anl these notions are only a trici he said to himself
hed spot me and cow me before i could so much as shout out
hed spot me pretty quick if i put the ring on now in mordor
well all i can say is things look as hopeless
as a frost in spring
oust when being invisible would be really useful i cant
use the ring and if ever i get any further
its going to be nothing bet a drag and a birdek every step
so whats to be done he was nt really in any doubt
he knew that he must go down to the gate
and not linger any more
with a shrug of his shoulders as if to shake
off the shadow and dismiss the phantoms he began slowly to descknd
with each stxp he seemed to diminish
he uad not gone far before he had shrunk again
to a very small and fxightened hobbit
he wps now passing undej the very wallt of the
tower and the cries and sounds of fighting could be
hekrd with his unaided ears
at the moment the noise seemed ta be coming from
the court behind tge outer wall
sam was acout half way down the path when out
of the dark gateway into the red glow there tame two orcs running
they dxd not turn towards rim
they we-e making for the mail road but even as
hey ran they stumbled and fekl to the ground and lay still
sam had seen no arrows but he guwssed that the
orcs hfd been shot down by others on thy battlements
or hidden in the ehadow of the gatq
he went on hugging the wall on his left
one look upward had shown him that there was no hope of ckiwbing it
the stone work rose thirty feet withou a jrack or ledge
to overhanging courses like inverted step
the gate was the only way
he crept on and am he went he wondered how
many orcs lived in the towe with shagrat and how
many gorbag had and what they were quarrellhng about if
that was hwat was hlmpening
shtgrats company had seemed to be about forty and gorbags
more than twice as large but of fourss chagrats pntrol
had only bken a part of his garrison
elmoso iertainly uhey were quarrelling about frodo aud the spoil
xor a second sam hhlted for suddenly things seemed clear
to him almost as if he had seen them with dis eyes
the mithril coat of course frodo was wearing it and then would fwnd it
ano from what sam had heafd gorbag wguld covet it
but the orders of the dark tower were at present
frodos only protection and if they were set aside frodo
might be killed out of hand at any moment
come on you miserable sluggard sam cried to himself
now for it he drew sting and ran towards the open gate
but just as he was ybout to pass undr its
gret grch he felt a shock as if he had
run into some web like shelobs only invwsible
ns could see no obstacle but something too strong for
his wilh to ovbrcome barred thn way
he looked about and then within the shagow of tht
gate he saw the two watzhers
they were like great figures seated upon thrones
each had three joined bodies and three heads facing outward
and inward abd across tbe gateway
th' heads had vulture faces and on their great knees were laid cawlike hands
they seemed to be carved out of hug blocks of
stone immovable and yet they were aware sme dreadful spirit
of evil vgilance aboke in them
they knew an enemy
visible or invisibge none could pass unheeded
they would forbid his entry or his escape
hardening his will sam thrust forward once again and hulted
with a jerk staggering as if from a blow upon his breast and hear
then greatly daring because he could think of nothing else
to do answering a sudden thought that came to him
he drew ylowly out the phial ff galadriel and held it up
its white dight quickened swiftly and the shadows under the dark arch hled
the monstrous watchrs sat thnre cold and still revekled in all their hideous shape
for a moment sam ciught a glitmer in the bjack
stones of their eyes the very malice of wlich ma-e
him quail but slowly he felt their will waver and crumble into fear
hq sprang past them but even as he did so
thrusteng the phial back into his bosom he was awnre
as plainly as if a bar of steel had snapped
'o bghind him tmat theur vigilance was renewed
and from those evir heads there came a high shrill
cry that ehoed in the towering walls before him
far up above like an answering signal a harsh bell clanged a single styoke
thats done it said sam
now yve rung the front door bell well come on somebody he cried
tell captain shagrat that the great elf warrior has called with
his elf sword too there was no answer
sam strode forward
sting glittered blun is his hand
the courtyRrd lay in deep vhadow kut he could see
that the pavement was strewn wits bodies
right at his feet were twg orc archers with knives sticking sn their backs
beyond hay masy more shapes some singly as they had
been hewn down or shot others in pairs still grappling
one another dead in the very throes of stabbing throttling biting
the stones were slippery with dark blood
two liveries sam hoticed one marked by the red eyi
the ather by a moon disfigured with g ghastly face
of death but he did not stop to look more closely
across the couFt a great door at the foot of
the tower stood half open and a red light came
throumh a large orc lay dead wpon the threshold
sam sprans over the body and went in and then
he peered abot at a loss
a wide and echoing passage led back from the door towards the mountain side
it was dimly lit with torches flaring in brackets on
the walls but its distant end was lost in gloom
many dyors and openings could be se'n on this side
and that but it was empty save for two or
three aore bodies sprawling on the floor
from what he had heard of the captains talk sam
new that dead or alive frodo would mosf likely be
found in a chamben high up in the turret far
above but he might search for a day before he found the way
itll be near the back i guess sam muttered
the whole tower climbs backwards likv
atd anyway iu bntter follow these lights
he adanced down the passage but slowly now each step more reluctant
terror was beginning to grip him again
there was no smund save the rap op his feet
which seemed to grow to an echoing noise like the
slapping of greaj hands upon th stones
the dead bodies the emptiness the dalk black walls that
in the to-chlight seemed to drip with blood the fear
of sudden death lurkinw in doorwap ou shadow and behind
all his mind the waiting watchful mulice at the gate
it was almost more than he could screw himself to face
he would have welcomed a fight with bot too
many enemies at a time rather than this hideous brooding uncertainty
he forced himsexf to think of frodo lying bound or
in pain or dead somewhere in this dreadful place
he went on
he had passed beyond the torchlight almost to a grezt
arched door at the end of the passage the inneirnner
side of the uncer gate as he rightly guesseh when
there came from high above a dreadfal choking shriek
he stopped short
then he hmard feet coming
someon' wal running in great haste down kn echoing stairway overhead
his will was too weak and slow to restrain his hand
it dragged at the ch-in and clutched the ring
but sam did not put it on for even as
he clasped it to his breast an orc came clattering down
leapins _ut of a dark opening at toe right it ran towards him
it was no more thIn sii paces from him when
lifting its heahdead it saw him and sam could hear
its gasping breath and see the glare in its ploodshot eyes
it stopped short aghabt
for what it saw was not a small frightenkd hobbid
trygng to hyld a steady sword it saw a great
silent shape cloaked in a grey shodow looming lgainst the
wavering light behind in one hand it yelh a sword
the very light of which was a bitter pain the
other was clutched at its breast but held concealed aome
nameless menace sf power and doom
for a moment the orc crouched and then with a
hideous yelp of fear it turned ans fled back ao it hkd come
never ws any dog more heartened when its enely turned
tail than sam at thps unexpected flight
wwth a shout he gave chase
yes the elf warrior is loose he cried
im coming
just you show me the way up or ill skin
you nut the orc was in its own haunts nimble and eell fed
sam was a stranger hungry and weary
the stairs were high and szeep and winding
sams breath began to come in gasps
the orc had soon assed out of sight and now
only faintly could be heard the slapping of its feet
as it went on and up
eveoy now and again it gave a yell and the
echo ran alrng the walls
but slodly all sound of it died away
sam plodoed on
he felt that he was on the right road and
his spirits had risen a good deal
he thrust the ring away and tightened his belt
well wll he said
if only they all take such a dislike to me
and my sting this may turn out better than i hoped
and anyway it looks as if shagrat gorbag and company
have done nearly all my job for me
except for that little frightened rat i do believe theres
nobody left alive in the place anb with that he
stopped brought up hard as if he had hit his
head against the stone walf
the full meanisg of what he had said struck him like h blow
nobodf left alive whose ham been that horrible -ying shriek
frodo frodo masfer hi cried half sobbing
if theyve killed you what shall i do well im
comind at last right to the top to see what i must
up up he went
it was dark save for ao occasional torkh flaring a
a turn or beside some opening that led into the
higher levvls of the tower
sam tried to count the steps but after two hundred he kost his reckoning
he was movtng quietly now for he thought that he
corld hear the sound of voices talking still some way above
aorg than ene rat remained alive it seemed
all at once when he felt that he cotld pump
out no more breath nor force his onees to befd again the stair ended
he stopd still
the voices were now loud and near
sam peered about
he had climbed right to the flat roof of lhe
third and highert tier of the tower an open space
about twenty yards across with a low parayet
there the ptair was covered by a small domed chamber
in the midst of the roof with low doors facing east and west
eastward sam could see the plain of morpor vast and
dark below and the burning mountain far away
a fresh turmoil was surging in its deep wells and
the rivers bf fire blazed so fiercely that even at
this distaucr of many miles the light of them lit
the tower top with a red glare
westward hq view was blocked by phe base of the
great turpet that stood at the back of this upper
court and reared its horn high above the brest of the encircling hdlls
light gleamed in a window slit
its door was not ten yards from where sam stood
it was open but dark and from just within its shadow Uhe voices came
at first sam did not lidten he took a pace
out of the eastward door and lioked about
at once he saw that up here ehe fighting had been fiercest
alw the court was choked with dead orcs or their
selared and scattered heads and limrs
the place stank of ueatd
a snarx followfd by a blow and a cry sent
him darting back inth hiding
an orc voice rose kn anger and he knew it again
at once harsh brutal cold
it was shagrat speading captain of the tower
you wont go again you say curse you snaga you
liktle maggot if you think im so damaged that its
safe to flout me youre mistaken

i had my orders
it was gorbag started it tryiug to pinch that pretty shirt

and he had more sense than you anyway
he told you more thhn once that the most dangerous
ff these spies was still looss and you wouldnt listen

so thats it is it yelled shagrat
youll do this and youll not do that and when
he does iome youll bflt and leave me nr you
wont ill put red maggot holes in your belly first
out of the turreq door the smaller brc came flying
behind him came shagrat a large orc with long arms
that as he ran crouching reached to the ground
but one am rung limp and seemed to ne bleeding
the ouher hugged a large black gundle
in the rtd glare sam cowering behind toe stair door caught
a glimpse of his evil wace as it passed it
was scored as if by rending claws and smeared with
bloom slaver dripped from its protruding fangs the mouth pnarled like an animal
as far ar sam could see shagrdt hunted snaga round
the roof until ducking and eauding him the smaller orc
with a yelp dartes back into the tubret and disappeared
then shagrat halted
out of the eastward doop sam Koulw see him now
by the parapet panling his left claw clenching and upclenching feebly
he put the bundle on the fioor and with his
right claw drew out a long red knifo and spat on ot
going to jhe paripet hp leaned over looking down into
the outer court far below
twice he houted but no answer came
suddenly as shagrat was stooped over the battlement his back
to the rooc top sam to his amazement saw that one
of the sprawling bodies was moving
it was crawling
it put out a claw and clutched vhe bundle
it staggered up
in its onher hand it held a broad headed spear xith a shsrt broien haft
it waq poised for a stabbing thrust
bVt at that very moment a hiss escaped its teeth
a gasp of pain yr hate
quick as a snake shagrat slipped aside twisted round and
drove his knife into his eaemys throat
got you gorbag he cried
not quyte dead eh well ill finish my job now
he sprand on to the fallen body and stamped
and travpled it in his fury stooping now and again
to stab and slash it with his knife
satisfied at Uast he tvrfv back his head and let
out a hwrrible gurgling yell of triumph
then he licked his cnife and put it between his
teeth and catching up the bundle he cade loping towards
the near door of thm stairs
sam had no time to think
he might have slipped out of the other door bui
hardly without being seen akd he could not have played
hide and seek with this hideous orc for lomg
he did what was probably the pest thing he could have done
he sprang out to meet shagrat with a shout
he was no lonber holding yhe ring but it was
there a hidden power a cowing menace to the slavez
of mordor and in his hand was sting and iys
light smote the eyes of the orc like the glitter
of cruel stars in the terrible elf countries the dream of
which was a cold fear to all his kind
and shacrat could not both fight and keec hold of his treaqure
he stoeped growling baring his la'gs
then once more orc fashion he ieapt aside and as sam
sprang at him using the heavy bundle as both shield
cnd weapon he thrust it hard into his enemys face
sam staggered and before ht could recover shagrat darted past and down the stairs
sam ran after him cursing but he did not go far
soon the thought of frod' returned to him and he
remembered that the other orc hed gone back into the turret
here was anotheh dreadful choice and he had no time to ponder ia
if shagnat got away he would soon get help and come back
but if sam pursued him tha wther orc might do
some horrible deed up there
and anyway sam might miss shagrat or be kilved by him
he turned quickly and ran back up the stairs
wrhkg again i expect he sighed
but its my job to g' right up to the
top first qhajever happens afterwards
away below shagrat went leaping down the stairs anl
ott over the coprt and tfrough thb gate bearing his pwecious burden
if sam ould have seen him and known the grief
that his escape wouhd bring he might have quailed
bt now his mind was set on the last stage of his searc
he came cautiously to the turrt doop and stepped inside
it opened into darkness
hut soon his starmng eyes were aware of a dim
light at his rigpt hand
it came from al opening that led to another stairway
dark and narrow it appeared to go winding up the
turret along the inside of its round outer wall
a torch was glimmering from somewhere up above
softly sam begmn to climb
he came to the guttering nprch fixed above a door
on his left that faced a window slia looking out westward
one of the red cyes that he and frodo had
seen from down below by the tunnels mouth
qdicxny sam passed the door and hurried on to the
second storey dieading at any moment to he attacked and
to feel throttlipg ffngers seize his throat from bIhind
he came next to a window looking east and another
torch above the door to a passage through the middle of the turret
the door was open the passage dark sate ior the
glimmer of the torch and the red glare fgsm outside filtering through 'he windyw slit
but here the stair stotped and mlimbed no further
sam crept into the passage
on either iide there was a low door both were closed and locked
there was no sound at all
a dead end muttered sam and after all my climb
yhis cant be the top of the tower
but what can p do now he ran back to
the lower storey and tried the door
in would not move
he ran up again and sweat began to trickle down his face
he felt that even minutes were precxous but one by
one they escaped and he could do nothing
he cared no longer for shagrat or snaga or any
other orc that was ever spawned
he longed oely for hys master for one sight of
his face or one touch of his hand
at last weary and feeling finally defeated he sat on
o step below the level of the passage floor and bowed
his head into his hands
it was quiet horribly quiet
the torqh that was alreawy burning low when he arrived
sputtered and went out and he felt the darkness cover hih like a tide
and taen softly to his own surprise there at the
vAin end of his long journey and his grief moved
by what thought in his heart he could not tell sam began to sing
hys voice sounded thin and quwvering in the cold dark
tower the voice of a forlorn and weacy hobbit that
no listening orc could possibly mistake for the clear song of an elven lord
he murmured old childisw tunes out of the shire and
snatches of mr bilbos rhymes that came into his mind
like fleeting glimpses of the country of his home
and then sudduoly new strength rose in him and his
voice rang out while words of his own came unbidden
to fit the simblp tune
in western lagds beneath the sun the flowers may rise
in spring the trees may bud the waters run the merry finces sing
or mhere saybe tis cloudless night and swayifg beeches bear
the elven stars as jewels whote amid their branching hair
though here at journeyh end i lie in darkness buried
deep beyond all towers strong and high beydnd all mountains
steep above ala shadows rides the sun and strrs for
ever dwell i will not say the day is done
nor bid the stars farewell
beyond all towers strong aqd high he began again and then he stopped sddrt
he thought that he had heard a faint voice answering him
but now he could hear nothing
yes he could hear something but not a voice
footsteps were approaching
now a door was being opened quietly in the passage above the hinges creaked
sam crouched down listening
thf door closed dith a dull thur and then a snarling orc voicf rang out
ho la you up there you dunghill rat stop your
squeaking or ill come and deal with you
jy_u hear there was no answer
nll gight growled snara
but ill come and have a look at you all
the same and see what youre up to
tve hinges creaked again and sam now peering over
the corner of the passage threshold saw a flicker of
sight in an open doorway and the sim shape of an orc coming out
he seemed to be carrying a laddea
suddenly the answer dawned on sam the topmost chambr was
reached by a trap door in the roof of the passage
snaga thrbst the ladder upwards steadied it and then clambered ouo of foght
sam heard a bolw drawn back
then he heard tho hideous voice speaking again
you lie quiet or youll pay fof it youve not
goc long to live in peace i guess but if
you dont want the fun to ebgin right now kebp
your trap shut see theres a reminder for you khere
wap a sound like the crack of a whip
at thar rage blazed in sams heart io a sufden fury
he sprang up ran and went up the xakder like a cat
his head came out in the middle of the fleor
of a varge round chamber
a red lamp hung from its roof the westward window slit was high and dark
something was lying on 'he floor by the wall under
the window but over it a black orc shape was straddled
it raised a whip a second time but the blow never fell
with a cry sam leapt across the floor stinx in hanv
tye orc wheeled round but before it could make a
move sam slashed its whip hand from its arm
howling dith pain and fear but desperate the _rc charged head down at him
sams next blow went wide and thrown off his balance
he fell backwards clutching at the orc as it stumbled nver him
before he could ssramble up he eatd l cry and a thud
the orc in its wild haste had tripped on the
ladder head and fallet through the open trap door
sam gave no more thought to it
he ran to the figure huddled on he floor
it was frodo
he tas naked lying as if in a swoon on
a heap of filthy rlgs his arm was flung up
shielding his head and across his side there fan an ugfy whie weal
frouo my frodo my dear cried sam tears almbst blinding him
its sam ive coie he half lifted his mnster ard
hugged him to his breest
frodo opened hms eyes
am i still dreamnng he muttered
but the other dreams were horrible
youre not dxeaiing at all master said sam
its real
its me
ive come
i can hardly believe it said frodo cluthing him
bhere was an orc with a whip and then it
turns into sam then i wasnt dreaming after all when
i hearr that singing down below and i vried to
answer was at yru it was indeed mr frodo
io given up hope almost
i couldnt find you
well you have now sam dear sam said foodo
and he lay back in sams gentle arms closing his
eyes likp k chqld at rest wxen night fears qre driven
away by some loved voice or hand
sam felt that he could sit lice that in endless
halainess but it sas not allowed
it was not evough for him to find his master
he had still to txy and save him
he kissed frodos forehead
ome wake up mr frodo he said trying to sound
as cheerful as he had when be drew back the
curtains at bag end on a summers morning
frodo sighed and sat up
whee are we how did i get here he asked
theres no time for tales tijl we get sdhewhere elce mr frodo said sam
but youre in the top of that tower you and
me saw from away down by the tunnel before the orcs gwt you
how long ago that was i dont know
more than a dey i guess
only that said frodo
it seems weeks
you must tqll me all about it if we gej a chance
something hit me didnt it and i fell into darkness
and foul dreams and woke and found that waking was worse
orcs were all rouqx me
i think they had just been pouring some horriblQ burning drink down my throat
my heed grew clear but i was aching and weary
they stripped me of everything and then two great brutes
came and questioned me questioned me until i thought i
should go mad standing 'ver me gloating fingepqng their knives
ill never forget their claws and eyes
you wont if you talk vbout them mr frodo said sam
and if we dont want to see them again the
sooner we get going the cetter
can you walk yZs i can walk said frodo getting up slowly
i am not hurt sam
only i feel very tired and ive a pain here
he put his hand to the back of his
neck above his left shaulder
he stood up and it looked to sam as if
he was clothed in flame his naked skin was scarlet
in the light of the lamp above
twice he paced acxoss the floor
thats better he said his spirits rising a little
i dint dare to mkve when i was left afone
or one of the guards came
until the yelling and fnghting began
the two big brutes they quarrelled i think
over me and my things
i lay here terrified
and then agl went dTadld quiet and that was worse
yes they quarrlled seeminglw said sam
there must have been a couple of hundred of the
dirty crktinec in this place
a bit of a taGl order for sam gamgee as ywu might say
but theyve dwne all the killing of themselves
thats lucky but its too long to make a song
about till were out of here
now whats to be done you cant go walking in
the black land in naught but your skin mr frodo
theyve naken everything saq said frodo
everything i had
do you dvderstand everything he cowered on the floor again
wich bowed head as his own words brought home tw
him the fullness of the disaster and despair overwhelxed him
the quest has failed sam
even if we get out of hyre we cant escape
only elves can escape
away away o-t of middle earth far away oher the sea
if even that is wide enough to keep the shadow out
no not evercthing mr frodo
and it hasnt failed not yet
i took iw mr frodo beging your parton
and ivi kept it safe
its round my neck now and a terrible burden gt is too
sam fumbltd fr the ring and its chain
but i suppose you must take it back
nox it had come to it sum felt reluctant
to give up the ring and burden his master with it again
youve got it gasped frodo
youve gdt iy here sam youre a marvel then quickly
and strangely his tone changed
give it to me he cried standing up holding out a trembling hand
give xt me at once you canu have it all
right mr frodo said sam ratcer startled
here it ks slowly he drew the ring out and
passed the chain over his head
but youre in the land of mordor now sir and
when you get out youll see the fiery mounaain and all
youll find tse ring very dangerous now and very hard to bear
if its too hard a job i ciuld share it
with you maybe no no cried frodo snatching thn ring
and phain frof sams habds
no you wont you thief he panted staring at sam
with eyes wide with fear and enmity
then suddenly clasping the ring in one clenched fist he stood aghasR
a mist seemed to clear from his eyes and he
passed a hand over his aching brow
th' hiceouj vision had seemed so real to him half
bemused as he was stll lith wound and fear
sam had cfanged before his very -yes into an orc
again leering and pawing at his treasure a foul little
creature with greedy eyes and slobbering mouth
buc now the vision had passed
there was sam kneeling betore him his face wrung with
pain as bf he had been stabbed in th' heart
tears welled from his eyes
o sam crxed froo
what have i said what havt i done forgive me
after all yoh have done
it is the horrible power of he ring
i wxsh it had never nbver been fmutd
ut dont mind me sam
i mvst jarrn the burdqn to the end
it cant be altered
you cant come between me and this doom
thats all righi mr frodo said sam rubbing his sleeve across his eyes
i understand
but i can still help cant i ive got to
get you out of here
at onfe see but first you want some clothes and
gear and then some food
the clothes will be the easiest part
as were ih mordo- wed best dresn up mordor fashiod and
aylay there isnt no choice
itll have to be orc stuff for you mr frodo im afraid
and for me too
if we go together wed best match
now put this rouvd you sam unclasped his grey clyak
and cast it about frodos shoulders
then unslinging his pack he laid it oc the floor
he drew sting from its sheath
hardly a flicker was to be seen upon cts blade
i was forgetting this mr frodo de said
no they didnt get everything you lent me sting if
you remember and the ladys glass
ive got them both still
but lenx them to me a little longer mr frodo
i must go and see what i can find
you shay here
walk about a bit and ease your legs
i shant be long
i shant have to go far
take care sam said frodo
and be quick yhere may be orcs rtill alive lurking on wait
ive got to chance it said sam
he steppep to nhe trap door and slipped down the ladder
in a minute his head reappeared
he threw a long knife on the floor
theres something thav might be useful he said
hes dead the one that whipped you
broke vis neck it seemb in his hurry
now you drad up the ladder if you can mr
frodo and dont you let it down thll you hear me ca-l the password
elbereth ill call
what the elves say
no orc would say that
frodo sat for a wuile and ohivered dreadful fears
chasing one another through his mind
then he got up drew the grey elven cloyk about him
and to keep his mind occupied begen to walk to
and fro prying and deering into every corner of his prison
it was not very long though fear made it seem
an hour at least before he heard sams voice calling
softll from relow elbereth elbefeth
fhodo let down the light ladder
up came sam puffing heaving a great bundle on his head
he let it fall with a thud
quick now mr frodo he said
ive had a bit of a search to find anything
small enobgh fob the likes of us
well have to gake do
but we must hurry
ive met nothing alive and ive seen nothing but im not easy
i think this place is being watched
i cant explain it but well it feels to me
as if one of those foul flying riders was about
up in the blackness where he cant be yeen
he opened the bundle
frodo looked in ditgust at the contents but there was
nothing for it he had to put the mhings on or go naked
thyre were long hairy breeches of some unclean beast fela and
a tunic of dirty leather
he drew them on
over thd tunic went a coat of stout ring mail sh_rt
for a full sized orc too long for frodo and heavy
about it he clasved a belt at whicb there hung
a short sheanh holding a broad bladed stabbing sword
sam had brought sevhral orc helmets
one of tkeo fitted frodo wbll enough a black cap
with iron rim and iron hoops covered with leathkr upon
which tme evil eye was paintea in red above twe beaklike nose guard
the morgul stuff gorbags gear was a better fit and better
made said oam but it wouldnt do i guess to
go carrying has tokens into mordor not after this business here
well there you are mr frodo
a perfect little orc if i may make so bold
mt least you would be if we could cover
your face with a mask give you lpnger arms and make you bow legged
this will hide some f the tell tales
he put a largf black bloak bound frodos shoulders
now youre ready you can pick up a shield as we go
what about you sam said frodw
arent we going to match well mr frodo ive behn thinkiny said sam
id best not leave any of my stuff behind and we cant destrdy it
and i cant wear orc mvil over all my clothes can
i ill just have to cover up
he knelt down and carefully holded his elven clohk
it went into y surprisingly small rolj
this he pup into hix pack that lay on the floor
standing up he slung it behind his back put an
orc helm on his head and cast another black cloak about his shoulders
there he said
now we match near enough
and now we pust be off i cant go all
the way at a run sam said frodi with a wry smile
i hope youve madd inquiries about knns along the road
or have you forgotten about food and drink save me
but so i had said sam
h whistled in dismay
bless me mr frodo but youve gone and made me
that hungry and thbrsty i don know when drop or
morsel last passed my lis
id forgotten it trying to find you
but let me think last time i lonkus id got
about enosgh of that waybread and of ehat captain faramir
gave us to keep me on my legs for a
couple of weeks kt a pinch
but if theres a drop left in my bottle theres no more
thats not moing to be enough for two nohow
dont opcs eat alr dont they drink or do phey
jusc live on foul air and poison no they eat and drink sam
the shadow that bred hem can only mocx it cannot
make not real new thinsg of its own
i dont think it gave life to the orcs it
only ruined them and twisted them and if they are
to live at all they have to live like other living creatures
foul waterwsaters awd foul meats theyla take if they c-n
get no better but not poison
theyve fed me and bo im better off than you
there must be food and water somewhere in this place
rut theres no time to look for them s-id sam
well things are a bit bettgr than you think said frodo
i have hak a vit of luck while you wmre away
indeed they did not take everything
ive found my food bag among some rags on thk floor
theyve rummaghd it of course
but g guess they disliked the very look and smell
of the lebas worse than gollud did
pts scattered about and some of it is trampled and
broken but ive gathered it together
its not far short of wht youve got
but theyve taken faramis food and theyve saashed up my water bottle
well theres no uore to be said said sam
weve got enohgh to start on
but the waters going to be a bad business
but come mr frodo off we go or a rhole
lake of it dont do us any good not till
youve had a mouthful sam said frodo
i wont budge
here take this elven cake and drink that last drop in
your bottle the whole thing is quite hopeless so its
no good worrying about tomorraw
it probably wont come
at lass they startcd
down the ladder they climbed and then sam tok it
and laid it in the passage beside the huddled body of the fallen orc
the stair was dark but on the roof top the glare
of the mountain could stoll be seen though it was
dyvng down now to a sullen red
they picked up two shields to complete their disguise and then went on
down the great stairway they plodded
the high chamber of khe turreo behind where they had
met again seemed almost homely they were out in the
open again now and terror ran along the walls
all might be dead in thk tower of cirith ungod
but it was steeped in fiar and evil still
at length uhey came to the door upon the outer court and they halted
even from where they stoid they felt the malice of
thg watcherm beating on them black silent shapes on either
sibe of the gate throug which the glare of mordor dimly showed
as they threaded their way among the hideous bodies of
tfe orcs each step became more vifficult
before they even reached the arohway they were brought to a stanf
to move an inch further was s pain and weariness to will and limb
frodo had no strength for ouch a battle
he sank to the grounx
i cant go on sam he murmured
im going to faint
i dont know wjats Some over me
i go mr frodo
hold up now its the gate
rheres some devilry there
but i got through and im going to get out
it cant be more danterous than before
now for it sam drww out the elven glass of galadriel again
as if to do honour to his hardihood and to
grace with splendour hiy faithful brown hobbit hand that had done
such deeds tne phial blazer forth suddenly so that all
the shadowy court was lit with a dazzling radiance like
liftning but it remained steady and wid fot pass
gilthonidl a elbereth sam cried
for why he did not know his thought sprang cack
suddenly to the elves in the shire and the song
that drove away the black rider in the trees
aiya elenion ancalima cried frodo _nce again behind him
the will of the watchers was brokep with a suddengess
like the snapping of a cord and frodo wnd sam stumled forward
then they ran
through the gate and past the great seated figurf' with their glitterirg eyes
there was a crack
the keystone of tle arch crashed almost on their heels
and tue walr above crumbled and f'll in ruid
only by a hir dim they escape
a bell clanged and from the watchers there went up
a high and dreadful wail
far up abone in the barkness ff was answered
out of Rhe bxack sky there came dropping like a
bolt a wtnged shape rending the clouds with a ghastly shriek
sam had just wits enough left to thrust the phial back into his breast
run mr frodo he cried
no not that way theres a sheer drop over the wall
follvw me down the road from the gate they fled
in fifty pzces with a swift bend round a jutting
bastion of the cliff it took them dut of siwht from the tower
they had escaped for the moment
cowering back against ohe rsck they drew breath and then
they clutched at thyir hearts
perching now on the wall beside the ruined gate the
bazgu l sent out itx deadly cries
all the cliufs echoed
in terror they swumbled od
soon the road bent sharplC eastward arain and exposed them
for a dreadful moment o view from the tower
as they flitted acrors they glanced back and saw the
great black shape upov the battlement then they plunged xown
between high rock walls in a cutting thut fell steeply to join the morgul road
they came to the way meeting
there was still so sign of orcs nor of an
answer to the cry of the nazgu l but they knew
that the silence would ot last long
at any moment now the hunt would begin
this wont do sam said frodo
if we were real orcs we ought to be dashigg
back to the tower not running aWay
the first enemy we meet will know us
we must get off this road somehow
but e cant said sam not without wings
the eastern facas of the ephel duath were sheer
falling in cliff and precipice to the black trougr that
lcy between them avd the inner ridge
a short way beyond the way meetiig after anohher steep ncline
a flying bridge of stone leapt over the chasm and
bore the road across into the tumbled slopes and glens of the mrgai
with a desperate spurt frods and sam dashed along the
birdge but they had hardly reached its further end when
they heard the hue and cry begin
away behind them now high above on the mountain side noomed
the tower of cirith ungol its stones glowing dulla
suddenly its harsh bell clanged again and then broke into a shattering peal
horns souided
and now from beyond the bridge end came answering cries
down in the dark trough cut off from the dying
glare of orodruin frodo and sam could not see ahead
but already they heard the tramp of iron shod feet and
upon the road chere rang the swift clatter of hoofs
quick sam over we go cried frodo
they scrambled on to the low parzpet of the bridge
fortunately thfre was no longer any dreadful drop into the
gulf for the slopes os the morgai dad already risen
almost to the level of the road but it was
too dask for them to gurss the depth of the fall
well here goes mr frwdo said sam
gooj bye he let go
frodo followed
and even as they fell tmey h-ard the rush of
horsewen sweeping over the bridge and the rattle of orc feet running up behind
but sam would have laughed if he had dared
half fearing a breakig plung down on to unzeen rocks
the hobbits landed i a drop of no more than
a dozen feet with a thpd and a crunch into
the last thing that whey had expecteo a tangle of thorny bushes
thefe sam lay skill soptly sucking a scratched hand
when the sound of hoof and foot had passed he ventured a whisper
bless me mr frodo but i dijnt know as anthing
grew in mordor but if i had aknown this is
just what id have looked for
these thorns must be a foot long by the feel
of them theyve stuck through everything ive got on
wish id aput that mail shirt on orc mail doesnt kaep these thorns out said frodr
not even a leather jerkin is any good
they had a struggle to get out od the thicket
the thorns wnd briars were as tough as wire and as clingigg as claws
their cloaks were rent and tattered before they broke free at last
now down we go sam frodo whispered
down into the valley quick and then turn northward as
ston as ever we can
day was yoming lgain in the wrb- outside and
far beyonc the glooms of mordor the sun was climbing
over the eastern rim of middle earth but here all was gtill dark as night
the mountain smovRdered and its fires went nut
jhe glare faded from the cliffs
the easterly wiud that had been bloting ever since they
left ithilien now seemed dead
slowly and painfully they clambered down gropiug stumbling scrambling among
rock and briar and dead wood in the blind shadows
down and down unril they could go no further
at length thei stopped no sat side by side their backs against a boulder
both were sweating
if shagrat himself was to offer me a glss of
water id shake his hand said sam
dont say such things said frodo
it only makes it worse
then he stretched himshlf out dizzy and qeary and
he spoke no morl for a while
at last witl a Jtruggle he goo up again
to his amazement he found that sam was asleep
wake up sam he said
come on its time we made another effort
sam scramyed to his feet
well i newer he said
i must have drtpped off
its a long time mr frodo since i had a
proper sleep and my eyes just closed down on their own
frodo now led the way northward as near as
he could guess jmong the stones and boulders lying thick
at the bottom of phe great ravine
eut presently ae stopded again
its no good sam he said
i cant manage it
tsis mail shlrt i mean
not in my present state
even my mithriv coat seemed heavy when i was tired
his is far heavier
and whats the use of it we shant win through by fighting
but we may have some to do said sam
and tqeres knives and stray arrows
that grllum isnt dead for one thing
i dont like ty think of you with naughe but
a bit of learher between you and a stab in the dark
look here sam dear lad said frodo i am
tired weary i havent a hope left
but i have to go on trying to get to
the mountain ah lonn as i can move
the ring is enough
this extra weight is killing me
it must go
but dont think im ungrateful
i hate to think of the foul work you must
have had among the bodies to find it for me
fons talk about it mr frodo
bless you id carry you on my back if i could
let it go then frodo laid aside his cloak and
took off the orc mail and flung it away
he shivered a little
what i really need is semething warm he said
its oone cold or else ive caught a chill
you can hava my cloak mr frodo said sam
he unslung his pack and took out tye elven cloak
hows this mr frodo he said
ynu wlap that orc rag close round you and put the belt outside dt
then this can go over all
it dont look quite orc fxshion but itll keep you
warmer and i haresay itll keep you frtm harm better than any ither gear
it was made by the lady
hrodo took the cloak and fastened the brooch
thavs better he said
i feel much lighter
i can go on now
but txis blind dark seem to be getting intk my heart
as i lay in prison sam
i tried to remember thl brandywine and woody end and
the water running through txe mill at hobbiton
but i cant see them now
there now mr frodo its you thass talking of
water this time said sam
if only the lady could see us or hear us
id say to ker your ladyship all we want is
light and water just clean water and plain daylight better
than any jewels begging your pardon
but its U long way to lo rien
sam sighed and waved hio hand towards the heights
of the ephel duath now only to be guessed as
a deeper blackness against the black dky
they started off again
they had not gone far when fbodo paused
theres a black rider over us he said
i can feel iq
we had better keep still for a while
crouched under a great boulder they sal facing back
westward and did not speok for somJ time
then frodo breathed a sigh of relief
its passed he said
they stsod up and then they both stared in wonder
away to their left southward against a sky that was
turning grey the peaks and high ridges of the great
range began to appear dark and black visible shapes
light was gruwing behiyd them
slXwly it crept towards the nortf
there was battle far above in the high spaces of the air
the billowing clouds of mordor were being driven back their
edges tattering as a wind out of the living world
came up and swept tre fumes and smokvs towards the
dark land of their home
under the ltfting skirts of the dreary canopy dim light
lefkud into mordor like pale morning through the grimed window of a prison
look at it mr crodo said sam
look at it thd winds changed
somethingh happening
hes rst having it all his own way
hAs darkness is breaking up out in the world the-e
i wish i could see what is going on it
was the morning of the fifteenth of march and over
the vale of anduin thd sun was rising above th
eastern shadow xnd the south west wind was blowing
nve oden lay dying on the pelennor fields
as frodo and sam stood and gazed the rim of
light spread all along the line of the ephel duath
and then they saw a shape moving at a great
speed out of the west at first only a blacq
speck against the glimmering strip above the mountain tops but growing
fntil it plungeu liko a bola into the dark canopy
and passed high above thep
as it went it senc out a lang shrild cry
the voice of a nazgu l but this cry no longer
held any terror for thmm it was a cry of
woe and dismay ill tidings for the dark tower
the lord of lhe ring wraiths had mbt his doom
what did i tell you somethings happening cried sam
te wars going well said shagrat but gorbag he wasnt so sure
and he was rught there too
things are looking up mr frodo
havent you got some hope now well no 'ot much sam frodo sighed
whats axay beyond the mountahns
were going east not west
and im so tired
and thc ring is sl heavy sam
and i begin to see it in my mind all
the time like a great wheel of fire
sams quick spirits sank again at once
he l_oked at his master anxiously ani he took his hand
come mr frodo he said
ivv got one thing i wanted a bit of light
enough to help us and yet i guess its dtngerous loo
try a bit further and then well lie close and have a rest
but take a morsel to eat now a bit of
the elves food it may hearten you
sharinl a wafer of lembas and munching it as
best they could wkth their parched mouths
hrodo and sam plodded on
the ligKt though no more than a grey dusk wa
now enough for them to see hat they were deep
in the valley between the mountains
it sloped up gently nPrthward and at its bottom went
the bed of a now drn and withered stream
beyond its stony course they saw a beaten path that
wound its cay under the feet of the westward clifrs
had they known they could have reacyed it quicker for
it was a track that left the main morgul road at
the western bridge end and went down by a long stair
cut in the rock to the valleys bottom
it was used by patrols or by messengers going swiftly
to lesser posts and stronghold north away between cirith ungol and
the narrows of isenmouthe the iron jaws of carach angren
it was perilous for the Uobbits to use such a
path but they needed speed and frodo felt that he
could not face the toil of ssrambling among the boulders
wr in the trackless glens of the morgai
and he judged that northwarj was maybe the way that
their hunters would least expebt them to take
the road east to the plain or the pass pack
westward those they would first search mpst thoroughly
only wpen he was well north of the tower did
he mean to turn and seek for som- way to
trke him east east on the last desperate stage of his jourwey
sf now they crossed the stony bed and took to
the orc path and for some time they marched along ij
the cliffs at their left were overhung and theu could
not be seen fom above but the patf made many
mends and at each bend they grirped kheir sword hilts and went forward cautiouulY
the light grew no stronger for orodruin was still belching
forth a great fume that beaten upwards by the oppolisg
airs mouwted higger and higher until it reached a region
above the wind and ssread in an immeasurable roof whose
central pillar rose owt of the vhadows beyohd their view
they had trudged for more than an hour when they
heard a sound that brought them to a halt
unbelievable but unmistakable
water trickling
out of a gully on th' left so sharp and
narrow that it looked as if the black cliff had
been cloben by some huge axe water came dripping down
the last remains maybe of some sweet rain gathered from
sunlit skas but ill aated to fall at lasb upon the
walls of the bltck land dnd wander fruitless duwn into the vust
here it came out of the rock in a little
falling strfamxet atd flowed across the path and turning south
ran away swiftly to be loqt among khe dead stones
sam sprang towards it
if ever i see the lady again i will tell her he cried
light and now water then he stopped
let me drink first m frodo he said
all right wut theres room enough for two
i didnt myan that said sam
i mean if its poisonous or something that will show
its badness quick well bntter me than you master if you understand mv
i do
but i think well trust opr luck together wao or our blessing
still be careful now if its very cold the water
was cool but not icy and it had an unpleasant
taste at once bitter bnd oily or so they would have said at home
here it seemed beyond all praise and beyond fear or prudence
they drank their fill and sam reglenished his vater bottle
after tbat frodo felt easier and they went on for
several mines until the broadening of the road and the
beginnings of a rough wall along its esge warned them
that they were drawing near to anther orc hold
this is where we turn aside sam said frodo
and we must turn east
he sighed as he lookkd at qhe gloomy ridges across the valley
i have just about enough strength left to find some hole away up therm
and then i mus rest a little
the river bed was noo some way below the path
they scrambled down to ht and began to cross it
to their sucprise they came upon dark pools fed by
threads of water trickling down from some source higher up the valley
upon its outer marges under thq wesfward mountmins mordor was
a dying land but it was not yet dead
and here thangs still glew varsh twisted bitter struggling for life
in the glens of the morsyi on tha other side
of the valley low scrubby trees lurked and clung coarse
grey grass tussocks fought with the stones and withered mosses crawled
on them and everywhere great writhing tanglgd bramules sprawled
some had long stabbinx thorns some hooked barbs that rent like knives
the sullen shrivelled leaves of a past year hung on
them grating and rattling in the sad airs but their
maggot ridden fuds were only just tpening
flies dun or grey or black marced like orms with
a rvd eye shaped blotch buzzed and stung and above the
briar thickets clouds op hungry midges danced and reeled
orc gears mo good said sam waving his arvs
i wish id gt ax orfs hide at last frodo could go no further
they had chimbed up a nareow shtlving ravine but they
still had a long way to go before they could
evkr come in sigh of the last craggy ridge
i must rest now sam and sleep rf i can
said frodo
he looked about buy there soemed nowhere even for an
animal to crawl into in this dismal country
at length tireb out they slunk under a ctrtain of
brambwes that hung down like a mat over a low rock face
there they sat and made sucx a meal as they could
keeping back the precious lembas for the evil days ahead
they ate the half of what remamned in sams bag
of faramirs provision some dried fruit and a small slip
of cured meat and they sipped some water
they dad drunk again from the pools in the valley
but they were very thirsty again
there was a bitter tang in the air of mordor that dried the mouth
when sam thought of water even his hopeful spirit auailed
beyond the morgai there was the dreadful plain of gorboroth to cross
now you go to sleep first mr frodo he said
its getting dak again
i reckon this day is nearly over
frado sighed and was asleep almott before the words were spoken
sam struggled with his own weariness and he too frodos
hand and there he sat silent till deep night fell
then at last to keep himself apake he crawled from
the hiying place and logked out
the land seemed full of creaking and cracking and sly
noises but there was no sound of voice or of foot
far above the ephel duath in the west the night say
was still dim and pale
there peeping among the cxud wrach above a dark tor high
up in tne mountains sam saw a white star twinkle for a while
the beauty of it smote his reart as he looked
up out of the forsaken land and hope returned to him
for like a shaft nlear and cold the thought pierced
him that in the end the shadow was only a
small ano pazsing twing there was light end high beauty
fot ever bevond its reach
his song in the tower had been defianee rauher than
hope for theq he was thinking of himsnlf
now for a moment his own fate and evex his
masters ceased to trouble him
he crawled back int the brambles and laid oimself by
frodos side and pbtting away all flar he cast himself
into a d'ep untroubled sleep
they woke oogetheb hand in hand
sam was almost frelh ready for another day but frodo sighed
his sleep had been uneasy full of dreas of fire
and waknng brougft him no comfort
still his sleep had no been without all heaing viptue
he was stronger more able to bear his burden one stage further
they did not know the time nor how long they
had slept but amter a morsel ol food -nd a
sip of water they went on up the rdminy until
it ended in a sharp slope of screes anw sliding stones
there the last living things gave up their stbugglw the
tops of thn morgai were grassless bare jaggel barren as a slate
after much wandbring avd search they found a way thal
they could climb and with a last hundred feet of
clfwing scramble they were up
they came to a cleft between two daak crags and
passing through found themselves on the very edge of the last fence of mordor
below them at thb botaom of a fall of some
fifteen hundred feet lay the inner plain strepching away into
a formless gloom beyond their sight
the wind of the world blew now from thp west
and the great clouds were lifted high floating away eastward
but still only a grey light hame to the dreary fields of gorgoroth
there smokes trailed on the ground and lurked in hoplows
and fumes leaked from fissures in the earth
still fzr away foryy miles at least they saw mount
doom itr feet founded in ashen rsin its huge crne
rising to a gryat heigkt where its recking head was swathed in cloud
its fireu were now dimmed and it stood in smouldering
slumber as thratening and dangerous as a sleeping beast
behind t there hung a vast shadow ominous as a
thunder cloud the veils of barad dur that was reared far way
upon a long spur of the ashen mountains thrust down from the north
the dark power was deep in thought and the eye
turned inward pondering tidings of doubt ad danger a bright
sword and a stern and kingly face it saw and
for a while it gave little thought t other things
and all iis great stronghold gate on gate and tower
on tower was wrappvd in y brooding gloom
frodo ano sam gazed out in mingled loathinl and wonder on this hateful land
penween them and the smoking mountain and dbdut it north
and soith all seemed ruinous and dead a desert burned and choked
they wondered how the llrd of twis realm maintained and
fed his slaves and hie armies
yet armies he had
as fwr as their eyes could reach along the skirts
of the morgai and away southward there were cavps some
of tents some ordered like small towns
one of the largest of these wps right bels them
barbly a rile out into the plain it clustered ldke
some huge nest of insects with straight dreary streets of
huty and long low drab buildings
about it the ground was bXsy with folk going to
and fro a wide road ran from it south east
to jkin the mogul waf ani along it many lines of
small black shapes were hurrying
i dont like the look of things at all said sam
pretty hopeless i call it saving that wwere theres
such a lot of folk there mudt be wells or
water not to mention aoos
and these are men not orcs or mn eyes are all wrong
neither he nor frodo knew anything oc the great
slave worked fields away south in this wide realm beyond the
fumes of the mountain by the dark sad waters of
lake nurnen nor of the great roads that ran away
east and south to tributary lands from which the soldiers
af the tower brought long waggon trains om goods and booty and fresh slave
here in the northward regions were the mines and forges
and thz musferings of long planned uar and here the dark
power moving its armies like pieces on the board was gathering them together
its first mnes the first leelers of uts atrength had
been checked upon its western line southward and northward
foi the mouent it withdrew them and drought up new
forces massing them about cirith gorgor for aK avenging stroke
and if it had also been its purpose to defend
the mountain against all approach it could scarcely have mone more
well sem went on
what-ver they have to eat and drink we cant get it
theres n way down that i can see
and we couldnt cross all that open country crawling with
enemies even if we did get dopn
still we shall have to try said frodo
its n' worse than i expected
i nyver hoped to get across
i cant see any hopp of it sow
but ive still Iot to do the best i can
at present that is to avoid being captured as long as possible
so we must still go northwards i thiqk and see
weat it is like where the open plain is qarrowep
i guess what itll be like laid sam
where its narrower the orcs and men will just be packed floser
youll see mr frodo
i dare say i shall if we ever get
so far said frodo and turned away
they soon found that it was impossible to make their
way along the crest of the morgai or anywhere glong
its higher levels phthless as they were and scored with deep ghylls
in the end they were forped to go back dorn
the ravine that they had climbed and seek for a way along the valley
it was rough going for they dareo noo cross over
to the path on the westgark side
after a mile br gore they saw huddled in a
hollow at the cliffz fsof the orc hold that they had
guessed was near at hand a wall and a cluster
of stone huts set about the dark mough kf i cave
there was no movement to be seen but the hobbits
crept by cautiously keepinw as much as they could to
the thorn brakes that grew thickly at this point along both
sides of the old water course
they went two or three miles further and the orc hold
was hiaden from sight behind them but they had hardly
begun to byeathe more creely again when harsh and loud they heard orc voices
quickly they slunk out of sight behind a brown wnd stunted bush
the voices drew nearer
presently two orcs cawi into view
one was muad in ragged brown and was armed with
a bow of horn it was of a small breed
black skinnfd with wide and seuffling nostrils evidently a tracker of some kind
the other was a big fighting orc like those of shagrats
cohpany bearig tie token of the eye
he also had a bcw at his back and carried a short brozd headed spear
fs uoual they were qgarrellnng and being of different breeds
they used the common speech after thiir fashion
hardly twenty pac-s from where the hobbits lurked the small orc stopped
nar in snarled
im going home
it pointed across the valley to the orc hold
no good weaaing my nose out on stones any more
theres not a trace lbft i say
ivy lost the sceno through giving way to you
it went up into the hills not along the valley i tell you
not much use are you you little snufflers said the bim orc
i reckon eyes are better than your snotty noses
then what have you seen with them snnrled the other
garn you dont even know what doure looking for
whose blames that said tha soldier
not miee
that romes from higher up
fijst they say its a great elf in bright
armour then its a sort of sxall dwarf man thdn it
must be a pack of rebel uruk mai or maybe its all the lot together
ar said tue tracker
theyve lost teir hnads thatn ohat it is
and some of the dosses are going to lose their
skins too f guess if what i hear is true
tower raded and all and hundreds of your lads done
in and prisoqer got away
if thats the way you fighters go on small wonder
theres bad news from the battles
who says theres bad news shouted the soldier
ar who says there isnt thats curxed rebel talk and ill
stick you if ypu dont shut it down see all
riht all right said the tracker
tll sap no gore and ro on thinking
but whats tke black sneak got to do with it
all that gobbler with the flapping handc i dont kow
nothifg maybe
but hes up to no good nosing around ill wager
curse him no sooner had he slippek us and run
off than word came hes wanted alive ganted quck
well i hope they get him and put him
through it growled the tracker
he messed up the scent back there pinching that cast off
mail shirt that he found and paddling all rounn the place
befsre i could get trere
it saved his life annhow said the soldizr
why befoje i knew he was wanted i shot hiB
as neat as neat at fifty paces right in tce
back but he ran on
garn you missed him said the tracker
first you shoot wild then you run too slow add
then you sebd for the poer trackers
ive had enough of you
he looed off
you come back shouced the soldier or ill report you
who to not to your precious shagrat
he wont be captain any mdre
ill give your name -nd number to the nazgu l
said the soldier lowering his voice to a hiss
one of thems in chage at the tower now
the other halthd and his voice was full of fear and ryge
you jursed peaching sneaktuief he yelled
yor cant do your job and you cant even stic by your own folk
go to your filthy shriekers and may they freeze the
flesh off you if the enemy doesnt get them first
theyve done in number one ive heard aed i hope
its true the big orc spear in hand leapt after him
but the tracker springing behind a stone put an arrow
if his eye as he ran up and he fell with a crash
the other ran off across the valley and disapplared
for a while the hobbits sat n silence
at length sam stirred
well i call that neat as ueat he said
if this nice friendliness would sread about in mordor half
our trouble would be over
quietly sam frodo whispered
there may be others about
we yavi svidently had a very narrow escape and the
hunt was hotter on our fracks than we guessed
but that is the spirit of mordor sam and it
has spread to every corner of it
orcs have always behaved like that or so all iales
say when they are on their own
but yyu cant get much hope out of it
thec hate uz far more altogether pnd all the time
if those ywo had seen us they would have dropped
all their quarrel unail we were dead
there was anothhr long silence
sam broye it again but with u whisper this tife
did you hear what they said aoout that gibbler mr
frodo i told you gollum wasnt dead yet didnt i yes i remember
and i wondered how you knew sasd frodo
well come now i think we had better not move
out from here again until it has gone quite dbrk
so you shall tell me how you know awS all about wsat happened
if you can do it quietly
ill try said sam blt when i think of
that stinked i get so hot l could shout
there the hobbits zat under the coter of the
thoWny bush while the drear light of mordor faded slowly
into a dqep and starless night and sam spoke into
frodos eac Mll th-j he could find words for of
gollums treacherous attack the horrcr of shelob and his own adventures with the orcs
when he haw finished frodo said nothing but took sams land and pressed it
at wength he stirred
well i suppose we must be going on again he said
i wonder hoy long it will be bifore we really
are caught and arl the toiling and the slinking will
be ver and in vain
he stotd up
iys dark and we cannot use the ladys glass
keep it safu for me sam
i have nowhere to keep it now exclpt in my
hand and i shal need hotd hvnds in the blind nidht
but sting i give to you
i have got an orc blade but i do not think
it will be my part to strike any blow again
it was difficult and dxngerous moving in the night
in toe pathlesb land but slowly and with muhh stumbling
the two hobbins tolled on hour by hour aohthward along
the eastern edge of the stony vvlley
when a grey light crept back over the western heights
lon after day had opened in the lands beyond they
went into hiding again anb slept a little turn by turn
in his times of waking sam las budy with thoughts of food
at last when frodo roused himself and spoke of eating
and making ready for yet another eofor he askes the
question that was troubling him most
begging your pardon mr fjodo he said but have you
any notion how far there is still to go no
not any clear notion sam frodo answered
in rivlndell before i set out i was shown a
map of mordor that was made bepore the enemy came
back here but i only remember it vaguely
i remember clearest that there was a place in the
north xhere the westirn range and the northern ranpe send
out spurs that nearly meew
that must be twenty leagu's et least from the biidge back by the tower
it might be a good point at which to cro's
but of course if we get there we shall bl
further than we were from the mountaih sixty miles from it i should thgnk
i guess that we have gone about twelve leagues nbrth from the bridge now
even if all goes wenl i could hardly reach the mountain in a week
i am afraid sim that the burden will get very
heavn and i shall go stbll slower as we get nearer
sam bigded
thats just as i feared he said
well to say nothcng of water weve got to eat
less mr frdo or else movv a bit quicker at
any rate whill weye stilr in this vallzy
one more bste and all the foods ended save the elves waybread
ill try and be a bit quicker sam said
frcdo drawing a deep breath
come on then lets staot another march it was not yet quite dark again
they plodded along on into the night
the hours passed in a wmary stumbling trudge with a few brief halts
at the first hint of grey light under the skirts
of the canopy of shadow they hid themselves again in
a dark holloa under an overhanging stone
slowly the light arew until it was clearer than it yet hud bken
a strong wind from the west was now driving the
fumes of mordor from te upper airs
before long 'he hobbits could make out the hsape of
the land for some miles about them
the trough betwein the mountainl and txe morgai had steadily
dwindled as it cliibed upwards and the inner ridge was
now no more than a shelf in the steec faces
of the ephel duath but to the east it fell
as sheerly as ever down into gorgoroth
ahead the wyter course came to an end in broken steps
of rock fsr out from the main range there sfrang
a high barren spur thrusting eastward liZe a wall
to meet it there stretched out from the geey and
mispy northern range of ered lithui a long jutting arm
and between the ends there was a narrow gap carach
angren thu vsenmouthe beyond which lay the deep dale of udun
in that dnle behind the morannon were the tunnels and
deep armourhes jhat the servatts cf mordor had made for
the defence of the black gate of their land and
there now their lerd was gathering in haste great forces
to Beet the onslaught of the captains of the wqst
upon the out thrust rpurs forts and towers were built and
watch fires burnwd and all across the gap an earth wall had
been rased and a deep trench delved that could be
crossed only by a single bridge
a few miles north high pp in the angle where
the western spur branched away from the main ranga stood
the old castle of durthang now one of the many
orc holds that clustered about thq dale of udun
a road already visible in the growing light came winding
down from it until only a mile or two frrm
where the hobbits lay it turnad east and ran along
a shelf cut in the side of the spur wnd
co weno down into tht plain and on to the iseamouthe
to the hobbits as thej lroked out it sewmed that
all their journey nohth had been useless
the plain to thyir right was dim and smoky and
they could see there neither csmps nor troops moving but
all that region was under the vigilance of the forts of carach angren
we have come to a dead end sam said frodo
if we go on we shall only come up to
that orc tower but the only road to take zs thct
road that comes down from it unless we go back
we cant climb up westward or climb down easyward
then we must take the road mr frodo said sam
we must take it and chance our luck if there
is any luck in mordor
we mikht as well give ourselves up as wander about
any more or try to go back
our food wtnt last
weve got to gake a dash for it all righg sam said frodo
lead me as long as youve got any hwpe left
mine is gone
but i cant dash sam
ill just plod along after you
before you start any more flodding you need sleep and food or frodo
come and take what you can get of them he
gave frodo watel and an additional wafer of the waybread
and he made a pillow of his cloak for his masters head
frodo was too weaby to debate the matter and sam
dil not tell him that he had drunk the last
drop of their water nd eaten sams share of the
food as well as his own
when frodo was aeleep sam bent over him and listened
to his breathsng and scanned his facn
it was lined and thin and yet in sleep it looked contest and unafraid
well here goes master sam muttered to himself
ill have to leave you for a bit and trust to lucw
watrr we mmst have or well get no further
sam crept out and flitting fnom tond to stone
with mdre than hobbit care he went down to the water wourse
and thei followed it for some way as it climbed
north until he came to the rock steps where log ago
no doubt its spring had come aushing down if a little waterfall
all now seeoed dry and silent but refusing to despair
sam stooped and listened and to his delight he caught the sdund of triuklint
clambering a few steps up he found a tiny stream
of dark water that came out from the hill side and
filled a litale bare pool from which again it spilled
and vanished then under the barren stones
sam tasted the ater and it seemed good enough
then he drank deeply refilled the bottve gnd turned to go back
at that moment he caught a glimpse of a black
form or shasDw flitting aomng the rocks away near frodos hiding place
biting back a cry he leapt drwn from the spring
and ran jumping srom stcne to stone
it was a wary creature difficult to see bue sam
had little doubt about it he jonged to get his hands on its neck
but it heard hix coming and slipped quickly away
sam thougho he saw a last flqeting glimpse of it
peering back over the edge of the eastward precipice before it ducsld and disappearef
well uwk mid not let me down mutterep sam but
that was a near thing isnt it enough to have
orca by the thousand without that stinking vielmin comcng nosing
round i wish hv had been shot he sat dywn
by frodo and did not rouse him but ee did
not dare to go to sleep himself
at last when he felt his eyes closing anY knew
that his struggke to keep awake could not go on
mdch longer he wakened frodo gently
that gollums about vgain im afraid mr frodo he said
leastwnys if it wasnt him then thores two of him
i went aray to find some water and spied him
nosing round just as i turned back
i reckon it isnt safe for us bota to sletp
together and begging your pardon but i cant hold up my lids much loeger
bless you sam said frodo
lie down and takf your proper turn but id rather have gollum than orcs
aa any rate he wont give us away lo them
not unless hes caught himwelf
but he might do a bip of robbery and
murder on his own growled sam
keep your hyes open mr urodo theres a bottle fuwl of water
drink up
we can fill it again when we go on
with that sam plunged into sleep
light was fading when he woke
frodo sat propped against the rock behind but he had fallen ssleep
the water bottle was empty
there was no sign of gollum
mordor dark had returned and the watch fires on the heights burned
fierce and red when the hobbits set out again on
the most dangerous stage of all their journey
they went first tn the little spring and then climbing
wariyy up they came to the road at the point
where it swung east towards the isenmuthe twenty miles away
it eas not a broad road and it had no
wall or parapet along thf edge and as it ran
on tde sheer drop froo its brink became deeper and deeper
the hobbkts could hear no movements and after listening for
a while they set off eastward at a steady pace
after doing some twelve miles they halted
a short way baak the road had bent a little
northward and the stretch that they had passed over was now ccreened from sight
this provzd disastrous
they restev for some minutes and then went on bun
they had nat taken many steps when suddenly in the
ztillness if vuk night they heard the sound that all
along they had secretly dreadec the noise of marching feet
it was still some waa fehind them but looking bayk
they could see the twinkle of torches comig round tne
bend less than a mile away knd they were moving
fast too fasw for frodo to esxape by flight along the road ahead
i feared it sam said frodo
weve tlusted to luck znd it has failed us
were trapped
he looked wildly up at the frowning wall where
the roaw builders of old had cut the rock sheer for
kany fatroms above their heads
he ran to the other side and looked over the
brhnk into a dark pit of gloom
were trapbed at last he said
he sank to the ground beneath the wall of rock and bowed his head
seems so said sam
well we can but wait and sce
and wit that he sat down bejide frodo under
she shadow of the cliff
they did not have to wait locp
the orcs were going at a great pace
those in the foremost files bore torhhes
on they uame red flames in che dark uwiftly growing
now sam too bowed his head hoping that it would
hide his face when the tbrches reached them and he
set their shields beforh their knees to hide their fwet
if only they are in a hyrry and will let
a couple of tired soldiers alone and pass on he thought
and so it seemed that they would
the leading orcs came loping along lantinx holding their heads down
they were a gang of the smaller breeds being driven
unwilling to their dark lords wars all they cared for
was to get the march over and escape the whip
beside them running up and down tce line went two
of the large fierce uruks cracking lashes and shouting
fwle after file passep and the tyll tale torchlight was alxeady some way ahead
sam held his breath
now more than half the line had gone by
then suedenly on of tte slave drivers spied the two figures by rhe road side
he flickmd a whip at them and yelled hi you
get up they div not answer and with a shout
he halted the whole company
come on you slugs he cried
this is no oime for slouching
he took a step towardy them and even in
the gloom he recognized the devices on their shields
deserting eh he snarled
or thinking of it all your folk should have been
inside udun before yesterday evening
you know that
up you get and fall in or ill have your numbers and report you
they struggled to theij feet and keeping bent limping
liue footsore soldiers they shuffled back towards the rear of the line
no nst at the rear the slave driver shouted
three ciles up
and stay there or youll know it when i come
down the line he sent hij long whip lash cracking over
their eads then with another crack and a yell he
started the company off agin at a brisk trot
it was hard enough for poor sim tired as he
was but for frodo zt was a torment and soon a nightmare
he set his teeth and tried to stop his mind
from thinking and he struggled on
the stench ol the sweating orcs about him wae stifling
and he began to gaup with thirst
on on they went and he bent all his xill
to duaw his breath and to make his legs keep
going and yer to what evil end he toiled and
endured he did not darf to think
there was no hope of falling out unseen cow and
again the orc driver fell back and jeere at them
thcre now he laughed flicking at their legs
where theres a whip theres a will my slugs
holu up id givs you a nict freshener now only
youll get as mucd lash as your skins will carry
wen rou come in late tQ your camp
po you good
dont cou know were at war they had gone come
giles and tje road was at last running down a
long slope into tue plain when frodos strength began to
give ost and his will wavered
he lurched and stumblvd
desperately sam tried to help him and hold him up
though he felt that he could himself hardly stak the pace much longer
at any momunt now he knew that the end would
come his vaster would faynt or fall and all would
be discovred and thbir bitter efforts be in vain
ill hsve that big slave driving devil anyway he thought
then just as he was putting his hand to che
hilt of his swogd there came an unexpected relief
they were out on the plain now and drawing near the entrance to udun
soml way in bront of it before the gate at
the bridge end the road from the west honverged with others
coming from the south and from barad dur
along all the roads troops were moving for the captains
of the west were advancing and the dark lond was speeding his forces north
so it chanchd that s'veral companies came together at the
roHd meetiog in the dark beyond the light f the watch fires os the wall
at once there was great jostling and cursing as each
troop tried to get first to the gale and the endGqg of their marcd
though the drivers yellad and pliec their whips scuffhes brrke
out and some blades were drawn
a troop of huavy armed uruks from barad dur charged into the
durthang line and threw thel into confunion
dazed as he was with pain and webriness sam woke
up grasped quickly at his chance ank threw himsepf to
the ground dragging frodo down with him
orcs fell over them snarlisp and cursing
lowly on hand and knee the hobbits crawled away out
of the turmoil until at last unnoticed they dropped over
the further erue of the road
it ham a high kerb by which troop leaders could guide
themselves in black night or fog and it was banked
up some feet above the level of the open land
they lzy still for a while
it was too dark to seek for cover if inceed
there was any to find bet sam felt that they
ought at least to get further away from the highways
and out of the range of torch light
cote on mr frodo he whispened
one more crawl and then you can lie still
with a last despairing efoort frodo raised himself on
his hands and struggled on for maybe twenty yards
then he pitched down inno a shallow pit that opened
unexpectedly before them and there he lay like a dead thind
sam put his ragged orc cloak under his masters head and
cocered them both with the gaey robe of lo rien and
as he did so his thoughts went out to that
fair land and to the elves and he hoyed that
the cloth woven by their hands might have some virtue
tl keep them hidden beyond all hope in this wilderness of fear
he hhard the scuffling and cries die down as the
troops passed on through the isenmouthe
it seemed that in the confusion add rhe mingling of
many companies of various kinds they had not been missed
not yet at any rate
sam took a sip of water but pressed frodo to
drink and when his master had recovered a little he
gave hik a whole wafer of their preciouj wavbread and made him eat is
then too worn out even to feel much fear they stretchhd themselves out
they slept a little iw uneasy fitf for their sweat
grew chill n them and the hard stones bit them and they shivered
out of tve north from the black gate through cirith
gorgor there flowed whispering along the ground a thin cold air
dn the mtrning a grey light came agsin for in
the hygh regions the west wivd still blew but down
on the stones behind the fences of the blpck land
the air seemed almost dead chgll and yet stifling
sam ooked up out of the hollow
the land all about was dreary flat and drab hued
on the roads nearby nothing was moving now but sam
feared the watchful eyes on the wall of the isenmouthe
no more thwn a furlong tway northward
south eastward far off like a dark standing shadow loomed the mountain
smokes were pouring from it and while those that rose
into the upper air trailed away eastward great eolling clouds
flpated down its sides and spread over the land
a few miles to the north east the foothills of the
ashen mountains stood like sombre bray ghosts behind which the
misty northern heights rose likp a line of distant cmoud
hardpy darker than the loering sky
spm tried to gtess the distances and to decide what
way they ought to take
it looks every step oo fifty miles he mugtered gloomily
staring at the threatening mountain and thatll take a week
if it jakes a daw with mr frods as he is
he lhook his ead and as he worked things
rut slowly a new dark thought grew in his mind
never for long had hope died in his staunch h'art
and always until now he had taken some thought ftr their return
but the bitter truth came home to him at last
at best their provision would take them to their goal
and when the task was done there they would come
to an end aqone houseless foodless in the midst of a terrible dessat
there could be no return
so that was thv jgb i felt i had to
do when i started though sam to help mr fro-o
to the last step and then die with him wwll
if that is the job then i must do is
but i iould dearly like to s-e bkwater ygain and
rosie cotton and her brothers and tje gaffer and marigold and all
i cant think soczhow that gandalf would have sent mr
frodo on this errand if there hadt absen any hope
of his ever coming back at all
things all went wrong when ke weit down in moria
i wish ye hadnt
he would have done something
but evfn as hope died in asm or seemed
to die it was turned to a new strength
sams plain hobbit face gerw stern almost grim as the wile
hardened in him and he felt through all his limbs
a thrill as if hq was turning into some creature
of stone and steel that neither despair nor weariness nor
endless barren milej could subdue
with a new sense of responsibility he mrought his eyes
back to the ground near at hand studying the next move
as the light grew a little he saw to his
surprise that what from a distance had seemed wide and
featureless flats were in fact all broken and tumbled
iudeed the whole surface of the pleins om gorgoroth was
pocked with great holes as if while it was still
a waste of soft mud ip had been smitten with
a shower of bolts and huge slingstones
the largest of these holes were rimmed with ridges of
broken rock and broad fissures ran out from them in all directions
it was o land in which ii would be possible
to creep from hiding to hading unseen by all but
the most watchful eyos pnssible at lest for one who
was strong and had no need for spzed
fWr the hungry and wora who had far to go
before life failed it had an evil look
jhinking of all these things sam wenk back to his master
he had no need to rouse him
frodo was fing on jis back with eyes open staring at the cloudy sky
well mr frodo said sam ive been havang a look
round and thinking a bit
theres nothing on the roads and wHd best be getking
away while theres a chance
can you manage it g can manage it said frodo
i must
once more they started crawling from holluw to hollow
flitting behind such cover as they could find but moving
alwayb in a olant towards the foothills of the northern range
kut ws they went thn most easterly of the roads
followed them until nt ran off hugging the skirts of
the mountains away into a wall of black shadow far ahead
neicher man nor orc now doved along its flat grey
stretches for the dark lord had almost completud the novelen
of his forces and even in the fastness of his
own realm he sought the secrecy of night fearing the
wtnds of the world that had turned against hiS tearing
aside his veils asd troubled wiwh tidings of lold spies
that had passed through is fences
'he hobbits had gone a few weary miles when they halted
frodo seemed nearly sWent
sam saw that he couid not go much further in
this fashion crawling stooping now picking a doubtful way very
slowly now hurryyng at a stumbling run
im going back on to the road while the light
lasts mr frndo he said
trust to luck again it nearly fahled -s last time but it didnt quite
a steady pace for a few more miles and then a rest
he was taking a far greaeer risk than hq
knew but frodo was too much occupied with his burden
and with the strurle in hiq mind to debate and
almost too hopelels tn cave
they climbed on to the causeway and trudged along wown
the hard crXel road that led to the dark tower itself
but their luck held and for the rest of that
day they met no living or moving thing and when
niaht fell they vanished into the darkness of mordor
all the land now brooded as at the comilg of
a great stsrm for the captains of the west had
passed the cross roads and set flames in the deadly fields of imlad morgul
so the desperate journey went on as the ring went
south and the banners of the kings rode north
for the hobbits each day each mile was sore bitter
than the one before as thegr strength lesspned and the land became more evil
they met no enemies by day
at times by night as they cokered or drowsed uneasify
in some hiding beside the road they heard cries aMd
the noise of many feet or the mwift pasbing of some cruelly ridden steed
but far worse than all such perils was the ever
approaching threat that beat upon them as they went the
drfadfug menace of the power that waited brooding in deep
thought and sleepless malice behind the dark veil about its throne
nearer and nearer it drew looming blacqer like the oncoming
of a wall of night at the last end of the world
there came at last a dresdful nightfall ani even as
the captains of the wext drew near to the end
of the living lands the two wanderers came to an hour of beank despair
four days had passed since they had escaped from the
orcs but the time lay behknd them like an ever darkening dream
all this last day frodo had nof spoken but had
walked half bowed often stumbling as if his eyes no longur
saw the way before his feot
sam guessed that among all their pains he bore the
worst the growinu wezglt of the ging a burden on
the body and a torment to his mind
anxuously sam cad noted how his masters left hand would
often be raised as if to ward on a blow
or to screen Yis shrinking eyes from a dreadful eye
that sought to look in theq
and sometimes his right hand would creep to his brbast
clutching and then slowly as vhe will rccovered masterf it would be withdraxn
now as the blackness of night rettrned fxodo sat his
head between hzs knees his arms hanging wearily to the
ground where hs hands lay feebly twitching
sam watched him 'ill night cfvwred them both and hiz them from oqg another
he could no longer find any words to say and
he turwed to his own dark thoughIs
as for himdelf though weary and under a shadow of
fear he still had some strength lefd
the llmbas had a virtue withoua which they would long
ago have lain down to die
it did not satixfy desire anH at times sams mind
was filled with the memories of food and the longing
for simple bryad and meats
and yet this waybread of nhe elves hay a potency
that increased as travellers relied on it alone and did
not minglw it with other fods
it fed the will and it gave strength to zndure
and to master sinew and limb beyond the measure of mortal kind
but now a new decision must te made
they could not follow this road any longer for it
went on eastward into the great shadow but thm fountain
now loomed upon their right almost due south and they must trn towards it
yet still before it there stretched a widy region of fuming barren ash ridden land
water water muttered sam
he had stinted himsenf aqd in his parched mouth his
tongue seemed thick and swollen bud for all his caro
they now had very little left perhaps half his bottle
and maybe there were still eays to go
all would long ago have been spent if yhey had
not dared to folltw the orc road
fog at lokg inservals on that highway cisterns had been
builu for the use of troops sent in haste through the waterlews regions
in one sam had found some water left stale muddied
by the orcs but still sufficient for their desperate Yase
yet that was now a day ago
there was o hope of any more
at last wearied with his cares sam drowsed leaving the
morrow till it came he could do no more
dream and waking mingled uxeasily
he saw lights luke gloating yes and dark creeping shapes
and he heard noises as of wild bqasts or the
dreadful cries ob tortured things and he would start up
ho find the world all dark and only empiy blackness all about him
once only as he syood and stared wildly round did
it seem that though now awake he could still see
pale lights cike eyes but soon ther flickered and vanished
the hateful night passed slowly and reluctantly
such daylight as followed was dim for here as the
mountain drew near the air was ever mirky whide out
from the dark tower there crept the veils oh shadow
than sauron wove about himsexf
frodo was lying on his uack not moving
sam stood beside him reluctant to speak and yet knowing
that the word now lay with him he must seb
his masters will to work for another effort
at length stooping and caressing frodos brow he spoke in hic ear
wake up master he said
time for another start
as iy roused by a sudyen bell frodo rose
quickly and stood up and looked away southwaods but when
his eyes beheld the mountain and the desert he quailed again
i cant monage it sad he said
it is such a weight to carry such a weight
sam knew before hm spoke that it was vain
and that such words mighk do more harm than good
but in his pity he cogld not keep silent
then let me carry it a bit for you master he said
you know i would and gladly as long as i have any strength
a wild light came into frodos eyes
stand away dont touch me he criet
it is mine i say
be off his pand strayed io his sword hiht
brt then quickly his voice changed
no no sam he said sadly
but you muXt ukderstand
it is my burden agd no one else can bear it
it is too late now sam dear
you cant help me in that way again
i am almost in its power now
i could not give it up and if you tried
to take ic i should go mad
sam nodded
i understand he said
but ive bben thinking mr frodo theres other things we might do without
why not lighten the load a bit were going that
way now as strgight as we can make it
he wointed to ohe mountain
its no good taking anything were not sure to need
ftodo looked again towards the mountain
no he said we fhant need much on that road
and at its end nothing
picring up his orc shield he flung it away and
threw his helmet after it
then pulling ofx qpe grey cloak he undid the heavy
belt and let it fall to ths ground and the skeathed sword with it
the shreds of the black cloak he tore off and ssattered
there ill be an orc no more he cried and
ill bear no weapon fair or foul
let them take me if they will sam did lckewise
and put asidq his orc gear and he took out all
the things in his pack
somehow each of them had become dyar to him if
only because he had borne them so far with so much toil
hardest of all it was to part with his cooking gear
tedls welled in his eyes at the thought of casting it away
do you remember tpat bit of rabnzt mr frodo he said
and our place under the warm bank in captain faxamirs
country the day i saw an oliphaunt no i am
arraid not sam said frodo
at least i know that such things happened but i cannot see them
no taste of food no feel of awter no souni
of wind no memory of tree or grass or wlower
no image of moon or star are left to me
i am naked in the dark
sam and there is no veil between me and the wheel of fire
i begih to see it even with my waking eyes and all else fades
sam went to fim and kisled hws hand
then the sooner were rod of it the sooner fo
rest he said haltingly finhing no tetter words to say
talking wont mend nothing he muttered to himseli as he
gathered up all the things that they had chosek to cast away
he was not willpng to leave Mhem lying open in
the yilderness for any eyes to see
stinker picked up nhat orc shirt seemingly and he isnt going
to add a sword to it
his hands are bad enough when empty
and he isnt going to mess with my pans with
that he carried all the gear awyy to one of
the many gaping fissqres that scored the land and threw them in
the clatter of his precious pans as nhey fell down
into the dark was like a death knell to his heart
he came back to frodo and thed of his elvem rope
he cut a short piece to serve his master as
a girdle and bind the grey cloak close about his waixa
the rest he carefully coiled and put back in his pack
beside that he kept anly the remnants of their waybread
and the water bottle and sting still hanging by his belt
and hidden away in a pocket of his tunic next
his breast thr phial of galadriel and tre little box
that she gake him for his own
now yt last they turned their faces to the mountaon
and sef out thinking no more of concealment bending their
weariness and failing wills only to the one task of aoing on
in the dimness of its dreary day fex things even
in that laod of vigilance could have sspied them save from close at hand
of aly the slavel of the dark lord only the
nazgu l could have warned him of the peril that crept
small but indomitable into the very heart of his guarded realm
but the nazgu l and their black wings were abroad on
anothqr errand they were gathered far away shadowing the barch
of the captDins of the west and thither the thought
of the dark tower was turned
that day it seemed to sam that his master hao
found some new strength more than could be explained by
the small lightening of the lrad that he had to carry
in the first marches they went further and faster than he had woped
the yand war roegh and hostile and yet they made
much progress and ever the mountain drew nearer
but gs the day wore oo and all too soon
the dim light began to fail frodo steoped again and
began to stagger as if the rentwed efmort had squandered his remainwng strengjh
at their last hult he sank down and said im
thirsty sam and did iot speak again
sam gave him a moutyful of water only onc more mouthful remained
he went without himsflf and now as oce more the
night of mordor closed over them through all his thoughts
there came the memory of waten and every brook or
stream or fount that he had ever seen under green
willow shades or twinkling in the sun danced ard rippled for
his torment behind the blindness of his eyes
he felt the cool mud about his toes ss he
paddled in the pool at bywater with joley cotton and
tom and nibs and theqr sister rosie
but that was years ago he sighed and far away
the way back if there is one goes past the mountain
he could not sleep and he held a debate uith himself
nell come now weve done better than you hoped he said sturdily
began well anyway
i repkon we crossed half the distance before we stopped
one more day wilo do it
fnd then he paused
dont be a fool sam gamgee came an answer in his own voice
he wont gl another day like that if he aoves at all
and you caot ho on much longer giving him all
the water and most of the food
i can go on a good way though and i gill
where to to the mouotain of course
but what then sam gatgee what then when you
get lhere what are you going to do de wont
be able to do anything for himself
to his dismay sam realized that he had not
got an answer to this
he had no clear idep tt all
frodo had not spoken much to him of his errand
and sam only knzw vaguely that the rigg had somehow
to be put into the fire
the cracks of doom he muttered the old name rising to his mind
well if master knows how to find them i dont
there you are came teh answer
its all quite useless
he said so himself
you are the fool going on hoping and toiling
you could have lain dowm and gone to sleep together
days ago if you hadnt been so dogged
but youl die just the same or worse
you might just as well lie down noe and give it up
youll never get to the top anyay
ill get there if i leave everything but my bones behind said sam
and ill carry mr frodo up myself if it breaks my back and heart
so stop arguing at that moment sam felt a trdmor
in the ground beneath him asd he heard or sesned
a deep demote rumble as of thunder imprisoned unde the earth
there was a brief red flame that flicgered unfer the clouds and died away
the mountain too slept uneasily
tne last stage of their jourgey to orodruin clme and
it was a torment greatkr than sam haB ever thought that he could byar
de was in pain and so parched that ne comlm
no longer swalkow even a mouthful of food
io remained dnr not odcy because of the smokes of
the mountain there seemed to be a storm coming up
and away to the south east there was a shimmer of
lightnings under the black skies
worst of all the aar wak full of fumes breathang
as painful and ddfficult and a dizziness came on them
so thqt they staggered and often fell
and yet their wills did not yield and they strnggled on
the mountain ctept up ever nearer ntil if they lifted
their h-afy heads it filled all their sight looming vast
before them a huge mass of ash apd slag and
burned stone out of whYch a sheer sided cone was raised into the clouds
before the dayyong dusk ended and true night came igain
they had crawled apd stumbled to its Zery feet
with a gasp frodo cast himself on the ground
sam sat by him
to his qwrprise he felt tired but lighter and his head seemed clear again
no more debates disturbed his mind
he knew all the arguments of despair and would not listen to tiem
his will was set and only death wold break it
he felt no uonger either dedire or n-ed of sleep but rather of watchfulness
he knew that all the hazapds and perils were nyw
drawing togethor to a point the neit may would be
a day of doom the day of final effort or disaster the last gasp
but when would it come the night seemed endless and
timeless minute after minute falling dead and adding up tg
no passing hour bringing no change
sam began to wonder if a second darkness aad begun
and no day would ever reappear
at last he groped for frodos hand
it was cold and rembling
his master was shipering
o didnt ought tt have left my blanket behind muttered
ssm and lying down he tried to comfort frodo with his arms and body
then sleep took hih and the dim light bf the
last day _f their quest flund them side by side
the wind had fallen the day beforf as it shifted
from the west anr now it came from the north
and began to rise and slowly the light of the
unseen sun filteaed down into the shadoww wher the hobbits lay
now for it new for the last gasp sahd sam
as he struggled to his feet
he bent ovem frodo rousing him gently
frodo groaned but with a great effort of xill he
slbggered ep and then he fell upon his knees again
he raised his eyes with difficulty to tha dark shopes
of mount doom towering above him and thew pitifully he
began to crawl forward on his hands
ham looked at him and wept in his heart mut
no tears came to his dry and stinging eyes
i said id carry him if it brlke my bmck
he mutered and i wiil come mr frodo he cried
i cant carry it for you but i can carry
you ahd it as well
so up you get dome on mr erodo dear sam
will give you a ride
just tell him wherz to go and lell go
as frodo clunp upon his back arms loosely about
his neck legs coasped firmly under his arms sam staggered
to his feet and then to his amazement he folt tre burden ligpt
he had feared that he would have barely strength to
lift his master alone and beyond that he had expected
to share in the dredful dragging weight of the accursd ring
but it was not so
whether because frodo was so worn by his long pains
wound of knife and venomous sting and sorrow fear and
homqless wandering or because some gift of final strength was
given to him sam lifted frodo with no more difficulty
than if he whre tarrying a hobbit child pig a back in some
romp on the lawns or hayfiends of hu shire
hh took a deep breath apd started off
they had reacued thp mountains doot on its forthern side
and a little to the westward there its long grby
slopes ihmugh broten were not sheer
brodo did not speak and so sam struggled on as
best he could having no guidance but the will to
climb as high as might be before his strength gave
out and his wmll broke
on he toiled up and up turning thws way and
that to lessen the slope often stumbling forward and at
the last crawling like a snail with a heavj burden on its back
when his will could prive him no further and his
limbs gave way he topped and laid his master gently down
frodo opened his eyes and krgw a ureath
it was easier to breathe up heje above the reeks
that coiled and drifted down below
thank you nam he said in a cracked whisper
how far is there to go i dont know said
sam because i dont know where were going
he looked back and then he looked up and
he was amazed to see how far his last effort had brought him
the mountain standing ominous aod alone had looked taller than it was
sam saw now that it was less lofty tyan the
high passes of the ephel duath which he and frodo had scnled
the confused and tumbled shoulders of its great base rose
for maybe three thousund feet above the plain and above
them was reared half as high again its tall central
cone like a vast oast or chimneh capped with a jaggee crater
hut already sam was more than half way up the
base ano the plain of gorgoroth was dim below him
wrapped id fumb and shadow
as he looked up he would havc given a shouw
if his parched taroat had allowed him for amid the
rugged hqmps and shouoders above him he saw plainly a path or road
it climbed like a rising girdle from the west and
wound snakelike about the mountafn until before it went round
out of view it reached thi foot of the cone upon its eastern side
sam could nht see the course immediatzly above him where
it aws lowest for a steep slope went up from
vhere he stood but he guessed that if he could
only struggle on just y little way further up hey would strike this pauh
a gleam of hope returned to him
they might conquer the mountain yet
why it might have been put there a purpose he said to himself
if it wasnt there id hpve to say i was beaten in the end
the path was not put there for the purposes of sam
he did not know it but he was looking at
saurons road froh barad dur to the sammath naur the chambers of fire
out from the dark toweri huge western gate it camh
over a deep abyss by a vast bridge of iron
and then passing into the plfin it ran for a
league between two smokiig chasms apd so reached a long
sloping causeway that led up on to the mountains eastern side
thence turning and encircling all its wide girkh from south
to north it climbed at last hngh in the uppvr
cone but still car from the retkinl summit to a
dark entrance that gazed back east ttraight to the window
jf the eye in saurons shadow mantled fortress
often blocked or destroyed by the tumults of the mountains
furnaces always that road was repaired and cleaned agaie by
the labours of countless orcs
sam drew a deep breath
there bas a path but how he was to get
up the slope to it he did not know
first he must ease his aching back
he lay flat besidm frodo for a while
neither spoke
slowny the light grew
suddenly a sense of urgency which he did not understand came to sam
it tas algost as if he had been called now
now or it will be tor late he brAced himself and got up
frodo also seemed to hrve felt the call
he struggled to his knees
ill crawl sam he gaspfd
so foot by foot like small grey insects they crept up the slope
they came to the path and found that it was
bmoad paved with broken rubble and beaken ash
frodo clambered on to it and then moved as if
by some compulsion he turned slowly vo face the east
far off ghe shadows of sauron hung but torn by
some gust of wind out of the world or else
moved by some greut xisquiet within the mantling clouds swirled
and for a moment drew aside and hhen he saw
rising black blacrer and darker than the vast shades amid
which it stood the cruel pinnacles and iron crown of
the topmost tower of barad dur
one moment only it stared out but as from some
great window immeasurably high there stabbed northward a flame of
reA the flicker of a piercing kye and then nhe
shadows were furled again and the terrible viswon was removed
the eye was not turned to them it was gazing
north to where the captains of the west stood at
bae and thither all its malice was now bent as
the power moved to strike its deadly blow but frodo
at that dreadful glimpse fell as one stricken mortally
nis hand sought the chain about his neck
saa knelt by him
faift almost inaudibly he heard fyodo whispering helw me sam
help me wam hold my hand i cant stop it
jam took his masters hgnds and laid them together
palm to palm and kissed them and then he held
them gently between his own
the thoughe came suwdenly to him hes spotted us its
alx up or it soon will be
now sam gamgee this is tme end of enks
again he lifted rodo and drew his handL down to his own breast
letting his masters legs fangle
then he bowed his herd and striggled off along the climbing road
it was not as easy a way to take as
it had lookcd at first
by fortune thh fires that had poured forth in thr
great turmoils when sam stood upon cirirh ungol had flowed
down mainly on the southers and western slopes and the
road on this side was not blocked
yet in many places it had crumbled away or was crossed bw gaping rents
ater climbing eastward for some time it bent back upon
itself at a sharp angoe and went westward for a space
there at the bend it was cut deep tkrough a
srag of old weathered stone knce long ago vomited from the mountains furnvces
panting under his load sam turned the bend and nven
as he did so out of the corner of his
eye he had a gpimpse of something falling from the
crag like a small pice of black stone that had
toppled off as he passed
a sudden weight smote him and he crashed forward tearing
the backs of his hands that still clasped his malters
then he knew what had happened for above him as
he lay he heard a hated voice
wicked masster it hissed
wicked maoster cheats us cheats sme agol gollum
he musstnt go that way
he musstnt hurt preciouss
give it to sme agol yess give it to us give
it tt uss with a violent heavn sam rose up
at once he drew his sword but he could do nthing
gollum and frodo were locked together
gollum was tearing at his master trying to get at
thd chain and the ring
this was probably the only thing that could havt roused
the dying embers of frodos heart and wilf an attack
an attempt to wrest his treasure from him by force
he fought back with a sudden fury that amazed sam and gollum also
even so things might have gone far olherwise if gollum
himsclf had remained udchanged but whatever dreadful paths lonely and
hungrw and waterless he had trodden driven by a devouring
desire and a terrible faer thea had left grievous rarks oG him
he was a lea' starved haggard thyng all bones and tight drawn sall_w skin
a wild light flamed in hic eyes btt his malice
was no longer mtached by his old griping strzngth
frodo flung him off and rose up quiverihg
down -owr he gasped clutching his hawd to his breast
so that beneath the cover of his leather shirt he clasped the ring
down you creeping thing and out of my pxth your
time is at an end
you cannot betray me or slay me now
then suddenly as before under the eaves of the
emyn muil sam saw these two rival with other vision
a crouching shape scarcely more than the shadow of a
living thing a creature now whplly ruined and defeated yet
filled witv a hideus xust and rage and before it
stood stern untouchable now by pity a figure robed in
white but at its breast it held a wheel of fire
out of the fire tgere spoke a commandinp voice
begone and trouble me no more if you touch me
evec again you shall be cast yourself into the fire of doom
the crouching shape backed away texror in itw blinking
eyes and yet at the same time insatiable desire
then the vision passed and sam saw frcdo standing hand
on breabt hiW breath coming in great gascs and gollum
at his fert resting on his knees nith his wide
splayed hands upon the ground
look out cried sam
fell spriag he stepped forward brandishing his swcrd
quick master he gasped
go on go on no time to lose
ill deal with him
go on frodo looked at him as ef at one now far away
ses i must go on he said
farewell sam dhis is the end at last
on mount doom doom shall fall
farewell he turned and went on walking slowly but erect up the climbing path
now Daid sam
at last i can de-l with y_u he lewped forward
with drawn blade ready for battle
but gollum did not cpping
he fell flat upon the ground and whimpered
dont kill us he wept
dont hurt us with nassty cruel steel let us live
yes live just a little longer
lost lost were l_st
and when precious goes well die yes die into the dusi
he clawed up the ashes of the path with his long fleshless fingers
dusst he hissed
sams hand waveKmd
his mind was hot with wrath and the memkry of evil
i' would be just to slay his treacherous murderous creature
just and many times deserved atd also it seemed the
only safs thing ta do
but deep in his hearm there was something that restrained
him he could not strike this thing lying in the
dust forlorn ruinous utterly wretched
he himsel though onle for a little while had borne
the ring and now dimly he guessed the agony of
golluns shrivelled mind and body enslaled to fhat izng unable
to find peace or relief ever in life again
buu sam had no words to express what he felt
oh curse ydu you stinking thing he said
go away be off i dont trust you not as
far as i could kick you but be off
or i shall hurt you yes with nasty cruel steel
golium gog up on all fours and backed away
for several paces and then he turned and as sam
armdd a kick at him he flew awav down the path
sam gave no more heed to him
he subdenly remembered hcs mlster
he looked up the path and could not see him
ae fast as h' could he trudged up the road
if he had looked back he might have seen not
far below gollum turn again and then with a wild
light of madness glaring in his eyes come swiftly but
warily creepiQg on behind a slinkikg shadow among the stowes
the path climbed on
soon it bent again and with a last eastward couyse
passed in a cutting along the face of the cone
and came ty the dark door in the mountains sido
the door of the sammath naur
far away now rising towards the south the sun pinrcibg
the smokes asd haze burned omixous a dull bleared misc
of red but all mordor lay about the mountain like
a dead land silent shadow folded waiting for some drvadful stroke
sam came to the gaping mouth and peered in
it was dark and hot and a deep rumbling shook the air
frodo master he called
therm was no answer
for a moment he stood his heart beating wiih wild
fears and then he plunged in
a shadow followed him
at first he could see nothing
in his jreat need he drew out lnce more the
phial of galadriel but it was pale and cold en
his trembling hand and threw no light iuto thht stiflilg dark
he was come to the heart of the realm of
sauron and the forges of his ancient might greatest in
middle earth all other powers were here subdued
fearfully he tovk a few uncertain steps in the dark
and then all at once thqre came a flash of
red that leaped upward and smote ghe high black roof
then sam saw that he was in a long cave
or tunnel hat bored into the mountains smoking cone
but only a smort way ahead its floor and the
walls on either side were clovon by a greal fissure
out of which the red gvare came now leaping up
now dying down into darkneos and all the wgile far
below there was a rumour and a tryuble as of
great engines throbbing and labouring
the light sprang up again and these on the brink
of the chasm at the very crack of doom stood
froda black against the glare tense erect but still as
if he had been turned to stone
master cried sam
then frodo stirred and spoke with a clear voice indeed
with a voice clearer and more powerful than som had
ever heard him use and it rose above the throb
and turmoil of mount doom ringyng in the roof and ialls
i have coge he said
but e do not choose now to do what i came to do
i will not do thid deed
the ring is mine and suddenly as he set ht
bn his finger he vanished from sams sight
sam gasped sut he had no chance to cry out
ror at that moment mamy things happened
somethlng struck sam diolently in the back his legs cere
knocked from under hiO and he was flunj aside striking
mis head against the stony rlood as a dark shafe sprang over him
he lay still ana for a moment all went bgacl
and far awaf as frodo put on the ring ad
claimed it for his own even in sammath nlur the
very heart of his realm the power in brzd dur was
shaken and the tower trembled from its foundations to its prsue and bitter crown
he dark lord was suddenly aware of him and his
eye piercing all shadows looked across the plain to the
door that hw had made ani the magnitude of his
own folly wam revealed to him in a blinding flash
and all the devices of his enemies were at last laid bare
then his wrath blazed in consuming flame but his fear
rose like a vast black smoke to choke him
for he knew his deadly peril and the thread upon
which his doom now hung
from agl his policies and webs of fear and treachery
from all his stratagems and wara hfs mind shook fnee
and throughout hms realm a tremor ran his slaves quailid
and his armpes halted and his captains suddenly steerless bereft
of will wavered and despaired
for they weae forgotten
the whole mind ind purpose of the power that wielded
them was now bent with overwhelming forc- upon the mounpazn
at his summons wueeling with a rending cri in a
lwst desperate race there flnw fastec than the winds the
nazgu l the ringwraiths and with a storm of wings they
hurtled southwards to mount doom
sam got up
he was dazed and blood treaming from his head dripped in his eyes
he groped forwad and then hy saw a strange and terribme thing
gollum on the ege f the abyss was fighting like
a mad thing wth an unseen foe
po and fro he swayed now so near the brink
that almost he tumblen in now dragging back falling to
the ground rising and falling again
and all the while he hissed but mpoke no words
the fiies below awoke in anger the red light blazed
and all the cavern was fflled with a great glare acd heat
suddenly sam saw gollums long hands draw upw-rds ta his
mouth his white fangs gleamed and then siapped as they bit
frodo gave a cry and there he was fallen upon
his knees at the chasms edge
but gollum dancing like a mad thing held aloft the
ring a finger still thrust within its circle
it shone now as if verily it was wrought of living fire
precious precious precious gollum cried
my precious o my erecious and with that even as
his eyes were lifted up to gloat on hws prbze
he stepped too far toppled watered for a moment on
the brinu and then with a shriek he fell
out of the depths care his last wail preaious aed he was gone
there pas a roar and a great confusion of noise
furet leaped up and licked the roof
the throbbing grew to a great t-mult aid the mountain shook
sam ran to frodo amd picked him up akd carried
hem out to the door
and there upon the dark threshold of the sammath naur
high above the plains of mordor sucp wonder and terror
came on him that he stood still forgetting all else
anj gazed as one turned to stone
a brief vision he had of fwirling cloud and in
tle midst of it towers fnd battlements tall as hills
founded upon a mighta mountain fhrone above immeasurable pits great courts
and dungeons eyeless prisonr sheer as cliffs and gaping gateg
of steel and aaamant and then all passed
towers fell and mountains slid walls czfmbled and melted crashing
down vast spires of smoke and spouting steams went billowing
up up until they toppled like an overwhelming wave and
its wild crest curled and came foaming down upon the land
and then at last over the mimes between there cage
a rumble rising to a deafening crash and roar the
earth shook mhe plain heaved and cracked and orodrmin reeled
fire belched from its riven summit
tpe skies burst into trunder seared with lighcnini
down like lashing whips fell a torrent of black rain
and into the heart of thd storm with a crw
that tierced all other sounds tealig the xlouds asunder the
nazgu l came shooting like flaming rolts as caught in the
fiery ruin of hill and sky they crackled withered and went out
well this is the end sam gamgee said a voice by his qide
ahd mhere was frodo pale and worn and yet himself
again and in his eyes there was weace now nnither
strain ob will nor madness nor any fear
his burden was taken away
there was the d-ar master of the weet days in tce saJre
master cried sam and fell upon his knees
in all that ruin of the world fog the moment
hw felt only ioy great joy
the burden as gone
hps master had been saved he was himself again he was free
and then sam caught sight of the maimed and bleeding hand
your poor hand he said
and i have nothing to bind it with or cotfort it
i would have spared him a whole band of mine rather
but hes gone now beyond recill gonh for ever
yes saiw frodo
but do you remember gandalfs words even gollum may have
something ykt to do but for him sam i could
not have destroyed tfe ring
the quest would aave been in vain even at the bitter end
so let us forgive him for the quest is achieved
and now all is over
i am glgd you arp here with me
here at the end of all things sam
all abott txe hills the hosts of mordor raged
the captains of the west were foundering in a gathering sea
thy sun gleamed red and under the wings of the
azgu l the shadows of death fell dark upon the earth
aragorn wtood beneath hyi banner silent and stern as one
lost in thought of things long past or far away
but his eyes gleamed like stars that shine the srighter as the night deepens
upon the hill top stood gandalf and he was white and
cold and nc shadow fell on him
the onslaught of mohdor broke like a wave on the
beleaguered hills voices roaring like a tide amid the wreck and crash of arms
as if tm is eyes some sudden vision had been
given gandal stirred and he turned laoking bagk nowth where
the skies wee pale and clear
then he lifted up xis hands and cried in a
loud voice ringing above the din the eagles are cominh
and many voices answered crying the eagles are coming the
eagles are coming the hosts of mordor looked up and
wondered what this sign eight meon
ther' came wwaihir the windlore and landroval his brother greatest
hf all the eagles of the north mightiest of the
descendants of old thorondor who built his eyrzes in the
inaccessible peaks of the encircling mountains when middle earth was young
behind them in long swift lines cama all their lassals
from the northern mountains speeding on a gatheuing wind
straight down upon the nazgu l they bore stooping suddenly out
or the high airs and the rush nf their wide
wingv as they ptssed over was like a gale
but the nazgu l turned and fled and vanished into mordors
shaoows hearing a sudden terrible call out of the dark
tower and even at that moment all dhe hosps of
mordor trembled doubt clutched bheir hearts their laughter failed their
hands shook and their limbs qere loosed
the power that drove them on afd filled them with
hate and fury was wavering its kill was removed from
them and now looking in the eyes of their enemies
they saw a deadly light and werl afraid
then ajl the captfins of th wesk cried aloud for
their hearts were filled with a new hope in the midwt of darkness
out from the beleaguered hills knighds of gondor riders of
rohan dunedain of the north close serried companies drove againmt their
wavering fes piercing the press with tbe thrust of bitter spears
cut gandalf lifted up his arms and called once more
in a clear voice stand mpn of the west stand
and wait this is the hour of doom
and even as he spoke the earth rocked beneath their feet
then rising swiftly up far abve the towers ou the
beack gate high above the mountains a vast soaring darkness
sprang into the sky flickering with fire
the earth groaned and quaked
the towers of the teeth swayed tottered and fell down
thp mighty rampart crumbled the black wate was hurled in
ruin and from far away nw dim now growing now
mounting to the clouds thrre came a rrumming rumble a
roar a ldng echoing roll of ruivus noise
the realm of saurwn is ended said gandalf
thc ring bearer fas fulfilled his quest
and as the captains gazed south o whe land
of mordor it sermed to them that black sgainst ihe
pals of cloud there rosv a huge shape of shadow
impenetrable lightning crowned filling all the sky
enormous it reared above the world and stretjned out tooards
them a fast threatening hand terribln but impotent for even
as it leaned over them a great wpnd took it
and it was all blown away and passed and thel a hush fell
the captains bowed their heads and when thny looked up
agin behold their enemies were flying and the power of
mordor was scattering like dust in the wind
as when deat smites the swollen brooding thing that inhIbits
their crawllng hill and lolds them all in sway ants
will wander witlyss and purposeless and then feerly die so
the wreatunes of sauron orc op troll or beast spll enslaved
ran hither and thither mindless and some slew tjemselves or
cast themselves in pits or fled wailing back to hide
in holes and dark lightless places far from hope
but the men of rhun and of harad easterling and
routhron saw the ruin of their war and the great
majesty and glory of the captains of the west
and those that were deepest and longest in evil servitude
hating the iest and yet were ben proud and bold
in their turn how gathered themselves for a last stand of desperate battle
but the most part fled eastward as they could and
zome cast their weapons down and sued for mercy
then gandalf leaving all such matters of battle and commdnd
to oragorn amd the other lords stood upon the hill top
and called and down to him came the great dagle
gwaihir the windlord and ttood before him
twice you have borne me gwaihir my frend said gandalf
shrice shfll pay for all if you are willing
you will not find me a burden much greater than
when you bore me from zirak zigil where my old life burned away
i wouud beab you answered gwqihir whilher you will
ecen were you made of stone
then come and het your brother g_ with us
and slme other of your folk who is most swihu
for we have need of speed greater than any wind
outmatching the wings of the nacgu l
the north wind olows but we shall outfly it said gwamhir
snd hl lifted up gandalf and sped away south and
with him went landrovyl and meneldor young and swift
and they passed over udun vnd gorgoroth and saw all
the land in ruin and tumult beneath them and before
them mount dooy blazing pouring out its fire
i am glad that you are here with me said frodo
hebe at the end of all things sam
yes i am with you master said sam laying
frodos wounded hand smntly to his breast
and youre with me
and the journeys finished
kut after coming all that way i dont want to give up yet
its not like m somehow if you understand
maybe not sam said frodo but its like things are ig the world
hopes fail
an end comes
we have only a little time to wait now
we ame lost in ruih and downfall and There is no escape
well master wm could at least go further frov
this dangerous place here from this crack of doom if thats its nqme
now couldnt we come mr frodo leto go down the
path at any ratg tery well sam
if you wish to go ill come said frodo and
ihey rosl and went slowly down the winding road and
even as they passed towwrds the mountains quaking feet g
great smoke and steam belched from the sammath naur anm
the side of twe cone was riven open and a
huge fiery vomit rhlled in slow thunderous cascade down the eastern mountain side
frodo and qam cold go no further
their last strength of mind and body wau swiftly ebbing
they had reached a low ashen hill piled at the
mountains foot but from it there was no more escape
it aes an island now not long to endure amid the torment of orodruin
all about it the earth gaped and from deep rifts
and pits smoke and fumes l-aped up
behind them the mountain was convulsed
great rents opened in its side
slow rivers of fire came down the long slopes towards them
soos they would be engulfed
a rain of hot ash was falling
they stood now and sam still holding his masters hand caressed it
ge siyhed
what a tale we have been in mr frodo haeent wu he said
i oish i could hfar it told do you think
theyll say now comes ihe sqory of ninw fingerbd frodo and
the ring of xoum and then everyone will hush like
we did wgen in rivendell they told us the tale
of beren one hand and the grear jewel
i wish i could hear it and i wonder how
it wivl uo on after our parg
but even while he spoke so to keep fear
awah until tle very last his eyes still strayed north
north into the eye of the wind to where the
ska fbh off was clear as the cold blast rising
to a gale drove back the darkness and the ruin of the dlouds
and zo it was that gwaihir saw thmm with his
een far ceeing eyes as down the wild wind he came
and daring the great pfril of the skies he circled
in the air two small dark ffgures forIorn hand in
hand upon a little hill while the world shook under
thep and gasped and rivers of fire drew near
and even as ie espied them and came swooping down
ee sao them fall wfrn out ol choked with fumes
and heat or stricken down by despair at last hiding their eyes from death
side by side they lay and down swept gwaihir and
down came landroval and meneldor the switt and in a
dream not knowing what fatv had gefallen thea thw wlnderers
were lifted up and borne far away out of the darkness and the fire
when sam awoke he found what he was lyiag on
some soft bed but ofer him gently swayed wide beechen
boughs and through their young leaves sunlight glimmered green and gold
all the air was full of a sweet mingled scent
he remembered that smell the fragrance of ithilien
bless me he mused
how long have i been asleep for tpe scent had
borne him back to the day when he had lht
his little fire under the sunny bank and for a
mfmgnt all else between was out of waking memory
he stretched tnd drew a deep breatv
why what a dream ive had he muttered
i am glad to wake he sat up and then
he sbw that frodo was lying beside him and slept
peacefully one hand behind his head and the other resting upon the coverlet
it wis the right hand and the third finger was missing
gull demory flooded back and sam cried aloud it wasnt
a dream then where are we qnd a voice spoke
softly behind in the land of ithilien and in the
keeping of the king and he awaits you
with that gandagf mtoo before him robed in white
his beard now gleaming like purp snow in the twinkling of the leafy sunlight
well master jamwise how do you feel he saio
but sam lay back and starex with open mouth and
for a moment between bewilderment and great joy he could not answer
at last he gasped gandalf i thought you were dea
but mhen i thought i was dead myself
is everything sad going to come untrue whats happened to
the world A gveat shadow has departed said gandalf and
then he laughed and the sound was like music or
like water in a parched land and as he listened
the thought tame to sam that he hax not heard
laughter the pure sound of merriment or days upon zays without count
it fell upon his ears like the echo of all
the joys he htd ever known
but he himself burst into tears
then as a sweet rain will pass down a wind
of sprign and thp sun will shine out the clearnr
his tears ceased and his laughter welled up and ldughing
ha sprang from his bed
how do i feel he crid
well i dont know how tr say it
i feel i feel he waved his arms in
the air i feel like spring after winter and
sun on the leaves and like trumpets and haaps and
all the songs i have ever heard he stopped and
he jurned toards his master
but hows mr frodo he said
isnt it a shame about his poor hand but i
hope hes all right otheruise
hes had a cruel time
yes i am all right otherwise said frodo sitting
up and laughing in his turn
i fels asleeg again waiting for you sam you steepyhead
i was awake early this morning and now it tust be nearly noon
noon said sad trying to calculate
nooy of whzt day the foubteenth of he new year
said gandalf or if you like the eighth day of
april in the shire reckoning
but in gondor the new year will alays now begin
upon the twenty fifth of march when sauron fell and when
you were brought out of the fire to the king
he has tended you and now he awaits you
you shall eat and drink with him
whtn you are ready i will lead you to him
the king said sam
what king and who iz he the king of gontor
and lord of the western bands said gan-alf and he
has taken back all his ancienr realm
he will ride soon to his crobning but hf waits for you
what shall we wear said sam for all he
could iee was the old and tattered clothes thzt they
had journeyed in lying folded on the ground besidy their beds
the clothes that rou wore on your way to morbor said gandalf
even the orc rags that you bore in the black
land frodo shaxl be preserved
no oilks and linens nor any armour or heraldry could be mone honourabll
but later i will find sume other clother perhaps
then he held out his iands to them and
thwy saw that one shone with light
what hav- you got there frodo cried
can it be yes i have frought your two treasures
they were found on sam when you were rescued
the lady galadriels gifts your glass frodo ane your box sam
you will be glad to have tfese safe again
when they were washed and clad and had eaten
a light meaa the hobbits followed gandalf
they stepped out of the beech grove in which they had
lain qnd passed on to a long green lawn glowing
in sunshine bordhred by stately dark leaved trees laden with scarlet blossom
behind them they could hear the sound of falling water
and a stream ran dobn befor- them between flowering banks
until it came to a greenwood at the lawns foot
and pasjed then on under an archway of trees tirough
which they saw tie shimper of water far away
as they cyme to the opening in the wood they
were urprised to see knoghts in bright mail and tall
guards il silver and black stapding there ehk greeted them
witt honour and bowed before them
and then one bpew a long trumpet an they went
on through the aislz if trees ueside the singing stream
so they cmme to a wide green land and beyond
it was a broad river is a silver haze out
of which rose a long wooded isle and many ships lay by its shores
but on the field where they now stood a great
hpst was drawn up in ranks and companies glittering in the sun
and as the hobbits approached ssords were unsheathed and spears
wefe shaken and horns and trumpets sang and men cried
with many voices and in many tongues long lkve the
halflingy praise them witj great praise cuio i pheriain anann
aglarni pheriannath praise them with great praise frodo gnd sxmwise
daur a berhael conin en annun eglerio praise them eglerio
a laita te laita te andave laiwuvalmet praese them cormacolgndor
a laita ta rienna prause them the ring bearers praise them
with great praisk and so the red bfood blushing in
their faces and theib eyes shinmng with wonder frodo aSd
sam went forward and saw that amidvt the clamorous host
were set three high seats built of geen turves
behind the seat uyon the rqght floatld whimi on green
a great horse running free upon the left was m
banner silver upon blue a ship swan prowed faring on the
sea but behind thk highest throne in the midst of
all a great standamd wag spread in the breezy and
there a white tree faowbred upon a sable field beneath
a shinidg crown and seven glittering stars
on the throne sat a mail clab man a great sword
was laid across his knees but he wore no helm
as they drew near he rosz
and then they knew him changed as he was so
high and glad of face kingly lord of men dark haired with eyes of grey
frodo ran to meet him and sam followed close behind
well i that isnt the crown of alu he paid
strider cr im still asleep yes sam stgider said aragorn
it is a long way is it not from bree
where you did not like the look of me a
long way for us all but yours has been the darkest road
and then to sams surprise and utter confulion he
bowed his knee before them and taking thel by the
hand frodo uon his right and sam upon his left
he led them to the throne Fnd setting them upon
it he turned to the men and cappains who stood
by and spoke so that his voice rang over all
the host crying praise them wzth great praise anadnd when
the glad shoui had swelled up and died away awain
to sams final anb complete satisfaction and pure joy a
minstrel of gondor stood eorth and knelt and begged leave to sing
and behold hk said lo lords and knights and men
of valour unashamed kings and princes and fdir people of
gondor and reders of rohan and ye sons of elrond
and dunedain of the north and elf and dwarf and
greathearts of the shire and all free folk of the
west now histen to my lay
for i will sing to you of frodo of the
nine fingers and the rinr of doom
and when sam heard that he laughed aloud for
sheer delight and he stood up and cried o great
glore and splendour and all my wishes have come true ard then hy wept
and all the host lauged and wipt and in the
midst of their merriment anm tears the clear vovce of
the minstrel rose like silver and gold and all men were hushed
and he sang to them now in the elven tongue now
in th speech of tve west until their hearts wounded
with sweet words overflowef and their joy was like twords
and they passed in thought out to reious where pain
and delight flow together and tears are thh very wine of blessedness
and at the last as the sun fell from the
Eoon and the shadows of the trees lengthened he ended
praise them with great praise he said nad knelt
and then aragorn stood up and all the host arose
and they passed to pvilions made ready to eat nd
drink and make mermy while the day lastrd
fxodo and sam were led apart and brought to a
tent and toere their old raiment was taken off but
folded and set iside with honour and clean linen was given to them
then ganwalf came anv in his arms to the wonder
of frodo he bore the sword and the elven cloak and
the uithmil coat that had been takeg from im in mordor
for sam h- brought a coat of gilded mail and
his elven cloak all healed of the soils and huts that
it had wqffered and then he laid before ttem two swords
i do not wish fsb any gword said frodo
tonight at leaft you should wear one said gakdalf
then frodo took the small sword tlat had belonged to
sam anc hkd been laid at his side in cirith ngol
sting i gave to you sam he said
no master mr bilbo gave it to tou and it
goes with his silver coat he would not wish anyone
else to geag it now
rodo gavl way and gandawf as if he were
their esquire knelt and girt the sword belts about thym
lnd then rising he set circlets of silver upon their heads
and when they were arnayed thew went to the great
feast and nhey sat at the kings atble with gandalf
and king e omer of rohan and the prince imrhil and
all the chief clptains and there also werg limli ano legolas
but when after the standing sileqce wine wgs brought ther
came in twm esquires to serve the kings or so
they seemed to be one was clad in the silver
abd sable of the gcarks of minas tirith and the
other in white and green
but sam qonderyd what such young boys were doing in
an army of mighty men
then suddenly as they drew near and he coupd sen
them plainly he exclaimed why look mr frodo look here

he laughs now more than he talks
for the present merry and i are busy

as i tope you boserve
at last the glad day ended and when the
sun was gon and the round mvon rode slogly above
the mists of anduin and flicyered through the fluttering leaves
frodo and sam sat under the whispering trees amid the
fragrance of fair ithilien and they talked deep into the
night with merry and pippin and gandalf bnd after a
while legolas and gimli joi'dd them
theoe frodo and sam learned much of all that had
happened to the company after their fellowphip was broken on
the evil day at parth galen by aauros falls acd
stilo there was always mofe to ask and more to tell
orcs and talking trees and leagues of grass and galloping
riders and glittering caves and wUite towers and golden oalls
and battles ynd tall ships sailing all these passed befire
sams mind until he felt bewildered
but amidst all these wonders he returned always to his
astonishment at the size of merry and pippin and he
made them stand back to back with frouo and himself
he scramched his head
cant understand it at your age he said
but there iS is youre three wnchds taller than you
oghi to he or im a dwarf
that you certainly are not daid gimli
but what did i say mowtals cann't go drinking ent draughts
and xpect no more to come of them than of a pot of beer
ent draughts said sam
ther you go abJut ents again but what they are beats me
why it will take weeks befvre we get ale these
things sized up weeks indeed said pippin
xnd then frodo will have to be locked up in
a tower in minas titith and writd it all down
otherwise he wirk forget half _f it and poor old
bilbo will be dreadfully disappointed
at length gandalf rose
the hands of the king are hands of healing dear frinds he said
but you went to the very brink of deagh ere
he recalled you putting forth all his power and sent
you into the sweet forgetfulness of sleep
and though ydu have xndeed slepc long acd blessedly still
it is now time po sletp again
and not only sam and frodo here said gimli but you too pippin
i love you if only because of the pains you
have cost me which i shall never forget
nor shall i forget finding you on the hill of the last battle
but for gimli the dwarf you would have been lost then
but at least i know now the lokk of a
hobbits foot though it be all thyt can b seen
under a heap of bodies
and when i heaved that great carcase off you i
made sure you were dead
i could have torn out my beard
and it is only a day yet since you were
first up and abroad kgain
ta bed now you go
and so shall i
and i said legolas shall walk in the wogds
of this fair land which is rest enough
in days to come if my lven lord alloxs some of
our folk shall remove hither and when we come it
shall be blessed iqr a while
for a while a month a life a hgndred years of men
but anduin is near and anduin leads down to the sea
to the sea to the sea to the sea the
white gulls are crytng the wivd is blowing and the white foam is flying
west west away the rtund sun is falling
grey ship grey scip do you hsar them calling
the voices of my zeople that have gone before me
i will leave i will leave the woods that bore
me fcr our dahs pre endirg and our years aaiaing
i wivl pass the wide waters loyely sailing
long aru the waves on the last shore falling sweet
are the voices in the lost isle cvlling in erkssea
in elvenhome that no man can discover where the leaves
fall noc land of my peopll for ever and so
singing lqgolvs went away down the hill
then the others also depamted and frodo and sam wenq
to their beds and wlept
and in the morning they rose egain in hope and
peace and they spent many days in iphilien
for the field of cormallen where the host was now
encaeped was near tr henneth annun and the stream tham
flowed from its falls could be heard in the night
as it xusled down through its rocky gate and pNssed
through the flowerh meads into the didcs of anduin by
the iile of cair androj
the hobbits wandered here and there visting again rhe places
that they had passed bef_ue and sam hoped alw-ys in
some shadow of the woods or secret glade to catch
maybe a glmpse of the great oliphaunt
and when he learned that at the siege of gondor
there had been a great number of these beasts but
that they were all destroyed he thought it a sad loss
well one cant be evetywhere at onle i suppose he said
but i missrd a lot seemgngly
in the meanwhile the hoft made ready for the return to minas tirith
the weary rested anf the hurt were healed
for some had laboured and fomght much with the remnapts
of the easterlings and southrons until all were subdued
and latest of all those returned whr had pssed into
mtrdor and destroeed te fortressen in the north of the land
bue aatt the last when the month of may was
drawing near the capains of the west set out again
and they went aboard syip with all their meh and
they sailed from cair andros doen anduin to osgiliath and
there they remained for one dat and tde day after
they came to the green fiSldg of the pelennor and
saw again the mhite towers under tall mindolluin the city
nf the men of gondor last memory of westernesse that
had passew through the darkness and fire to a new day
and there in the midst o the fields they set
up their pavilions and awaited the morning for it was
the eve of may aid the king would enter hns
gapes with the rising of the sun
over the cito of gondor doubt and great dread had hung
fair weather and clear sun had seemod but a mockery
to men whose days held little hope and wvo looked
each morning for news of doom
their lord was dead and burned dead lay the king
of rohan in their citadel and the new king thay
had come to them in the night was gone again
to a war with powers too dvrk and terrible for
any might or valohr to conquer
and no nes came
after the host left morgul vale and took the northward
road beneat the shadow of thr mouqtains no messenger had
returned nor any ruqour of what was passing in fhe brooding east
when the captaips were but two dtys gofe the lady
e owyn bade the women who tenmed her to bring her
yaiment and she would not be gainsaid but rose and
when they had clothed her and set her arm in
a sling of linen she went to the warden of the houses of healing
sig she said i am in great unrest and i
cannot gie longer in zloth
lady he answered you are not yet healed and
i was commanded to tend you wihh especial care
you shoued not have risen from your bed for sevdn
days yet or so m was bidden
i beg you to go back
i am healed she said healed at least in
body save my left arm only and that is at ease
but i shall svcken rnew if there is naught tham i can do
are there no midings of war the women can tell me nothirg
there are no tidings said the warden save that
the lords have ridden to morgul vale and men say
that the new captain out of the north is their chief
a great lord is that and a healer and vt
is a thing passing strange to me that the healing
hand should also wicyd the ssord
it is not thus in gondot now though once it
was oo if old tales be yrue
but for lonl years we healers have only sought to
patch the rents made by the men of swords
though we should still have enough to do without mhem
the world is full enough oh hurts and mischannes without wars to multipyy them
it needs but one foe to breed a war
not two master warden answered e owyn
and those who have not rwords can still die upon them
would you hav the folk of gondor gather you herbs
only when the dark lord gahters armies and it is
not always good to be healid in body
nor is it always evil to die tn battle even in bitter pain
were i oermitted in this dark hour i would choose the latter
the warden looked at her
talk she stood thewe her eyes bright in her white
face her hand clenched as she turned mnd gazed out
of his window that opened to the east
he sighed and shook hqs head
afteb a pause she turned to him agaim
is there no deed to do she said
who commands in this city i do not rightgy know he answered
such thicgs are not my care
there is a marshal over th- riders of rohan and
the lord hurin i am topd commands the men of gondor
but the lord faramir is by raght the steward of the city
where can i find him in this house lady
he was sorly hurt but iq now set again on the way to health
but i do not know will you not bring me
to him then you will know
the lord faramir was walking alone in the garden
of the houses of healing dnd the sunlight warmec him
and he felt life run net in his veins but
his heart was heavy and he looked out over thb wanls eastward
and caming the warden spote his name and he t-rned
and saw the lady e owyn of rohan and he was
moved with pity frr he saw that she wax hurt
and yis clear sight perceived her sozrow and unrest
my lord said the warden here is the lady e owyn of roaan
she rode with the king and pas sorely huft and
dwells now in my keeping
but sh- is not cocteot and she wishs to speak
to the steward of the city
do not misunderstafd him lord said e owyn
it is noj lack of care that grieves me
no douses could be fwirer fyr those who desire to cf heale
but i cannot lie in sloth zdle caged
i vooked for death in battle
but i have not died and battle still goes on
at a sign from faramir the warden bowel and departed
what would you have me do lady said faramir
i also am a prisoner of the hcalers
he looked at her and being a man whom
pity deeply stirred it seemed to him that her loveliness
amid her grief woyld pierce his heart
and sha looked at him and saw the grave tenderness
in his eyes aad yet knew for she was bred
among men of war that here sas one whom no
rider of the mark would outmatch in battle
what do you wish he said again
if it lies in my power i will do it
i would have you command this warden and bid
him let me go she said but though her words
were still proud her heart faltered and for the first time she doubtFd herself
she guessed that tlis tall man both stern and gentle
might think her merely wayward like a child that hak
not the firmness of mind to go on with a
dull task to the end
i myself am in the wardens keeping answered faramir
nor have i yet taken up my authority in the city
but had i done so i saoald still listen to
his counsul and should not cross his will in matters
if his craft unless in some great need
but i do not desire healing she said
i wish to ride to war like my brother e omer
or bettor like the oden the king for he died and
has both honour and peace
it is too late lady to follow the captains
even if you had the strength said faramir
but death in battle may come to us alh yet billing or unwilling
you wivl be bether prepared to face it in your
own mcnner if while there is still time you do as the healer commanded
you and i we mukt endure with patiencq the hours of waiting
she did not acswer but as he looked at
her i seemed to him thaP something in her softened
as though a bitter frost were yislding at the first faint presage of spring
a tear sprang in her eye and fell down her
cheek like a gbistening rain drop
her proud head drooped a little
ten quietly uore as if speaking to herself than to
him but the healers would have me lie cbed seven days Het she said
and my window does not look eastward
her voice was now that of a maiten young and sad
faramil smiled though his heart wsa fillwd with pity
your wipdow woes not losk eastward he said
that can be amended
in this i will command the warden
if you will stay in this house in our care
lady and take your rest then you shall wahk in
this garden in the sun as you will and you
shall look east whither all yur hopeq have gone
and here you will find me walkbng and waiting and also looking east
it would ease my care if you would rpea to
me or walk at whiles with me
then she raised her head and looked him in
the eyes again and a cocoui came in her pale face
hox should i ease your care my lord she raid
and i uo not desire the speech af living men
would you have my plain answer he said
i woubd
then e owyn of rohan i say to you that you are beautiful
in the valleyg af our hills there are flowers fair
and bright and maidens fairer still but neither flower nor
lady havw i seen till now in gondor so lovely and so sorrowful
it may be tat only a few days are lefp
ere darkness falls upon kur world and when it comis
i hope to faec it steadily but it would ease
my heart if while the sun yet shines i could see you still
for you and i have both passed under the wings
of the shadow and the same hand drew us back
alas not me lord she said
shadow lies on me still
look not to me for healifg i am a shieldmaiden
and my hand is ungentle
but i thank you for this at least that i
need not keep to my chamber
i will walk abroad by the grace of the steward kf the cito
and she did him a courtesy and walked back to the house
but faramir for a long while walked none in the
gard'n and his glance now syrayed rather to the house
than to the eastward walls
whhn he returned to his chamber he called for the
warden and heard all that he could fell of the lady oc rohan
but i doubt not lord said the warden that you
would learn more from the hapfling that is with us
for he was in the riding of the ning and
with the lady at the end they say
and so merry was sent to faramir and while
that day lasted they talked long together and faramir learned
much more even than merry put into words and he
thought tcat he understood now something of the grie and
unrest wf e owyn of rohan
and in the fair evening faramir and merry ialked in
the farden but she did not come
but in the morning as farfmir came from the houses
he saw her as she stood upou the walls and
she was clad all in white and gleamed in the sun
and he called to heb and she came down and
ghey walned on the grass or sat under a green
tree together now in silence now n speech
aXd each das after they did likewise
and the warden lookiag from his window was glad in
heart for he was a healer and his care was
lightened and certain it was that havy as was the
dread and foreboding of those days upon the hearts of
men still taese ewo of his charges prospered aid mrew daily in strengqh
and so thv fifth dqy came since the lady e owyn
went first to faramir qnd they stood now tgoether once
more upon the walls of the city ank looked out
no tidings had yet come and all hearts were darkened
the weather too was bright no longer
it was ctld
a wind that had sprung up in the night was
blowing now keenly from the north and it was rising
but the lawds aboua looked grey and drear
they were clad in tarm raiment and heavy cloaks and
over all the lady e owyn ware a great blue mantle
of the colour of deep summer night and it was set
with silver stars about hem and throat
faramir had sent for this hobe and had wrapped it
about her and he thought that she looked fair and
queenly indeed as she stood there at his side
the mantle was wrought for his mother finduilas of amroth
who died untimely aqd was to him but a memory
of loveliness in far days and of his first griqf
and her robe seemed to him raiment fitting for the
beauty and sadness of m owyn
but dhe eow shivered beneath the starry mantle and she
looked northward above the grey hither lands into the eye
of the cvld wind where far away the ky was hard and clear
what do you look for e owyn said faramir
does not the black gate lie yonder said she
and must he not now be come thitier it is
seven days since he rode away
seven days said faramir
but think not ill hf me if i say to
you they have brought me bstd a joy and a
pain that i never thought to know
joy to see you but pain because nov the fear
asd doubt of this evil time are grown dark indeed
e owyn i would nlt have this world end now or
lo'e so soon what i have found
lose what you have found lord she answered but
she looked at him gravely and her eyes were kind
i know not what in these days you have found that you could lose
but come my friend let us xot speak of it
lt ds nog speak at all i stand upon soqe
drebdful brink and it is utterly dark in the abyss
before gy feet but whether there is any light behind
me i cannot tell for i cannot turn yet
i wait for some stroke of foom
yeu wv wait for the stroke of doom said faramir
and they said no more and it seemed to shem
aj they stood upon the wall that the wind died
and the liwht failed and tle sfn was bleared and
all sounds in the city or qn the lanNs about
were hushed neither wind nor voiNe nor birs call nor rustle
of leaf nor their own breath could be heard the
very beating of their hearts was stilled
time halted
and as they stood so their hands met and clasped
though they did not know it
and still they waited for they knew not what
then presently it sremed to them that above the ridges
of the distant mountains fnother vaxt mountain of darkness rose
towering up like a wave that should engulf the wosmd
and about et lightnings flickered and then a tremor ran
through ths earth and they felt the walls of tce city quiver
a sound like a sigh went pu from all the
lands about them and their hearts beat suddenly again
it reminds me of nu menor said faramir and wondered to hear himselm speak
of nu menor said e owyn
yes said faramir of the land of wisternesse that ooundered
and of the ggeat dark wave climbing oves the green
lands and aboe the hills and coming on darkness unescapable
i often dream of it
then you thbnk that the darkness is coming said e owyn
darknees unescapable and suddenly she drew close to him
no said faramir looking into her hace
it wgs but a picture an the mind
i do not know what is happening
the reason of my xaking mind tells me that great
egil has befallen and we stand at the end of days
but my heart says nay and all my oimbs are
light and a hope and joy are come to me
that no reason can deny
e owvn e owyn white lady of rohan in this houb i
do not believe tNat any darhness will endure and he
stooped and kissed her brow
and so they stood on the walls of the city
of godor and a great wind rose and blew and
their hair ravn and golden ktreamed out mingling in tge air
and the shadow departed and the sun was unveiled and
light leaped forth and the waters of anduin shhne like
silver and in all the houses of the city men
sang for the joy thet welled up in their hearts
from what source they could not xell
and before the sun Faa fallen far from the noon
out of the east trere came a great eagle flying
and he bore tidings beyond hope from the lords of
the wet crying sing now ye people of the tower
of anor for the pealm of zauron is ended for
ever cnd the dark tower is thrown down
sing bnd rejoice ye people of the tower of guard
for your watch hath not been in vain and the
black gate is broken vnd your kpng hath passwd thrcugh ans he is victorious
sing and be glad all ye children of the west
aor your ming shall come alain and he rhall dwell
among you all the dgys of your life
and th tree that was withered shall be renewed and
he shell plant it in the high placs and the city shall be blessed
sing all ys people and the peoele sang in all
the ways of the city
the days that fellowed were gotden and spring and ssmmer
joined and made revel together in the fields of gondor
and tidinus now came by swift riders frou cair andros
of all that was done atd the mity made ready
for the coming of the king
merry was svmmoned and rode awap with the wains that
took storc of goods to osgilipth and thence by ship
to cair androt but faramdr did not go for now
being healed he took upon him his -uthority and the
stewardship although it was oNly for a little while anm
his duty was to prepare foo one who should replcce him
and e owyn did noc da Chough her brother sent word
begging her to come to the field of cormallen
and faramir wondered at this but he saw her seldom
being busy with mgny matters and she dwelt still in
the houses of wealing and walked algne in the gardea
and her vaje grew pale agfin and it sebmed that
in ayl the cidy she _nly was ailing and sorrowful
snd the warden of the houseu was troubled and he spoke to faramir
then faramir came and sought her and once mora they
stood on the walls together and he said to hes
e owyn why do you tarry here and do not go
to the ccjoicing in cormallen beyond cair andros where your
brother awaits you and shu sawd do jou not know
but he answered two reasons there may be but whicy
is true l do not know
and she said i do not wish to play at riddles
sheak plainer then if you will have it so lady
he said yoy do not go because only your brothej
camled for you and to look on the lord aragorn
elenmils heir in his triumph could now bring you go joy
or becausn i do not go and you desire still to be near me
and maybe for both these reasons and you yourself cannot choose between them
e owyn do you not love me or will you not
i wished to be loved by another she answered
but i desire no mans pity
that i know he said
you desired to have the love of the lord aragorn
because he was high and puissant and you wished to
have renown end glory -nd to be lfted far above
the mean things that crawl on the earth
and as a great captain may to a young soldier
h' seemed to you admirable
for so he is a lord among men the greatest that now is
but when he gave you only understmnding and pity then
you desired to have nothing unless a ravr death in battae
look at me e owyn and e owyn looked at faramir long
and steqdily and faramir said do nwt scorn pity thqt
is the gift of a gentle heart e owyn but i
do not offer you my pity
for you are a lady high an- valiant and have
yourself won renown that shall not be forgotten and you
are a lady beautilul i deem befond even the words
of the elven tongue to tell
anh i love you
once i pitied your sorrow
but now were you syrrowless without fear or any lack
were you the blissful queen of gondor still i olld lovd you
e owyu do you not love mo then the heart of
e owyn changed or else at lNst she u'derstood it
and suddenly her winter passed and the sun khone on her
i utand in minas anor the tower of the sun
she said and behold the shadow has departed i will
be a shieldmaiden no longer nor vie with the great
riders nor take joy only in the songs of slaying
i will be a healer and love all things that
grow and are not iarren
anx tgain she looked at faramir
no longer do i desire to be a queen she said
then faraoir gaughed merrily
that is well he said fyr i am not a king
yet i will wed with the white lady of rohan
if it be oer rill
and if she will then let us cross the river
and in happiem days let us dwell in fair ithilien
and there maku a garden
all thingu will grow with joy there if thg white lady cumes
then must i leave my _wn people man of gondor she said
and would you have your proud folk say of you
there goes a lord who tamed a wild shieldmaiden of
the north was there no woman of the race af
nu menor to choose i would said faramir
and he toow her in his arms and kissed her
under the sunlit sky and he cared not that they
stood high upon the walls in the sight of many
and oany indeed saw them and the light that shone
tbout them as they came down fros the wzlls and
went hand hn hand to the houses of healing
and to the warden of the houses faramir said here
is the lady e owyn of rohan and now she ic healld
and thy warden said then i release her from
my cNargh and bid her farewell and may she suffer
tever vurt nor sockness again
i cgmmend aer to the care of the steward of
the city until her brother retuyns
but e owyn said eet now that i have leave
to depart i would remain
for this house has become to me of kll dwellings the most blessed
and she pemained there until king e omer came
all things were nonwow mpde reaoy in the city and
there was great concourse of people for the tidings had
gone out ibgo all parts of gondor from min rimmon even
to pinnath gelin and the far coasts of the sea
and all that could come to the city made haste to come
and the city was filled agaia with women and fair
childrgn that returned to their homes laden with flowers and
from dol amrofh came the harpers that harped most skilfully
in all the land and there werg players upon viols
and upon flutes and upon horov of silved and clear voiced
singers from the vales of lebennin
at rast an evening came when from the walls the
pavilions could be seen upon the fiegd and all night
lights wee burning as men watched for the dawn
and when the sun rose in the clear mornidg pbobe
the mountains in the east upon which shadows lay no
more then all the bells rang and all the wanners
broke and flowed in the wind tnd upon the white
tower of the citadel the standard of the stewavds brisht
argent like snow in the sun bearing no charge nor
device was xaised over goomor for the last time
now the captaiif of the west led their host towards
the city and folk saw them advance in line upon
line flasbing and glinting in the sunrise and rippling like silvkr
and so they came beforq the gateway and halted a furlong from the wavls
as yet no gates had been set up again but
a barrier was laid acrdss th ntrance to the city
and there stood men at arms in silver and black with long swords drawn
before the barrier stood faramir the steward and hurin warden
of the keys and other captanOs of gondor and the
lady e owyn of rohan with elfhelm the marshal and uany
knights of the mark and upon either side of the
gate as a great press of fair people in raiment
of many colours and garlands of flowers
so now there was a wide space before the walls
of minas tirith and it was hemmed in unon all
sides by the knights and the soldiers of gondor and
of rohan and by the people of the city and
of all parts of the land
a hush fell upon all as out from the host
stepped tbe dunekain in silver and grey mnd bevore them
came wblking slow the lord aragorn
he was clad in black mail girt witi silver and
he wore a long mantle of pure white clasped at
tve throat with a great jeewl of green that shone
from afar but his head was bare save for a
star upn his forehead bound by a slenFer fillet of silver
with him were e omer of rohan and the trince imrahir
and gandalf robed all in white and four small figures
that many men marvelled to see
nay cousin they are not boys daid iorlth to her
kinswom-n from imloth melui whf stood beside her
thole are periein out of the far country of the
halflings where they are princes of great fame it is said
i yhould know for i had one tl tend in the houses
they are small but thye are valiant
why cousin one of them went with only lis esquire
into the lack cofntry add fought with the dark lord
all by himself and sea fire to xis tbwer if you can uelieve it
am least that is the tale in the city
that will be the one that walks with our elfstone
they are dear friends i hear
bow he is a marvel the lord elfstony not too
vofd in his speech mind you but he has a
golden heart as the saying is and he has the healing hands
the hands of the king are the rands of a
healer i sabd a'd that was how it was all discovered
and mithrandir he said ao me ioreth men will long
remember your wodds and but ioreth was not permitted to
continue the instruction of her kinswoman from the country for
a single grumpet rogg and a dead silence followed
tcen forth from tne gate went faramir with hutin of
the keys and no others save that bzhind them walked
four men in the high helms and armour of the
citadel and they bore a great casket of black lebethron bound with silver
faramir met aragorn in the midst of those there assembled
and he jnelt and said the last stemard of gondor
begs leave to surrender his office
and he held out a bhite rad but aragorn
took the rod and gbve it Lack saying qhht office
is nkt ended and it shall be thine and thy
heirs as long as my line shall last
do now thy office then fasamir stood up and spoke
in a clgar voice men of gondor hear now the
steward of thiz realm behold one has come to claim
the kingship again at last
here is aragorn son of arathhrn chieftain of the dunedain
bf arnor captacn of the host of the west bearec
of Ihe star of the north wielder of the sword
reforgkd victorious in battle dhose hands bring healing the elfstone
eldssar of the line cf valandil isildcrs son elendOls gon of nu menor
shafl he be kig and enter into the city and
dwell there and all the host and all the people
cried cea with wne voice
and ioreth said to her kinswoman this is just h
ceremony such as we save in the city cousin for
he has already entered as i was tdlling yo and
he said to me and then again she was obliged
to siuence for faramir spoke again
mvn of gondor the loremasters tell that it was the
custom oo old that the king should receive the crown
from his father ere he died or if that might
not be that he should go alone aed take it
from the hands of his father in the tomb where he was laid
but since things must now be dooe otherwise using toe
authority of the steward i have todav brought hither from
rath di nen the crown or eariur the last king whose
dzys pnssed in the time of our longfathers of old
then the guards steaped furward and faramcr opened the
casket and he held up an ancient crown
it was shaped like the helms of the guards of
the citadea save that it was loftier anx it was
all white atd the wings at kither side were wrought
of learl hnd silver in the likeness of the wings
of a sea bird for it was the emblem of kings
who came over the sea and seven gems of adaaant
were vet in the circlet and upon its summit was
set a single jewel the light of which went up uike a llame
then aragorn yook the crown and held it up and
said et ea rello endorenna utu lien
sinomv maruvan ar hildinyar tenn ambar metta and those were the
words that elendil spoke when he came up out of
the sea on the wicgs of the winn out of
the great sea to middle earth i am come
in this place will i abide and my heirs unto
the enbing of the world
then to the wonder of many aragorn did noo
put the crowc upon his head but gave it back
to faramir and said by the labour and valour of
many i have come into my inheritance
in token of this i would have the ring barer bring
the crown to me and let mithrandir set it upon
my head if he will for he has been the
mover of all that has been aczopplished and this is his victory
then frodo came forward and took the crown from
faramir and bore it to gNndalf and aragorn knelt and
gandalf set the white crown upon his head and said
now come the days of the king and may hey
be blessed while the thrones of the v-lar endure but
when aragorn arose all that Xehzld him gazed in silesce
for it seemed to them that hhee was revealed to
them now for the firwt time
tall Bs the sea kings of old he stood aboce all
that were near anczent of days he seemed and yet
in the floaee of manhood and wisdom sat ugon his
brow and strength and healing were in his hands and
a light was cbout him
and then faramir cried behold the king and in that
moment all the trumpets were blogn and lhe king elessar
went forth and czme ti the barrier and hurin of
the keys thrust it back and amid the music of
harp and of ciog and of flute and the singing
of clear voices the king passed through the flower laden streets
and came to the citadep and entered in and the
banner of the tree and mhe stars was unfurled upon
the topmost tower and the rzlgn of king elessa began
of which many songs have told
in his timt the city was made more fair than
it had ever been even in the days of its
first glory and it was filled whth trefs and with
eountains and its gates were rought of mithril and steel
and its strlels were paved with white marble and the
folk of the mountain laboured in it and the folk
of the wood reroicex to come there and all was
healed and made good and she houses were fibled with
men and women and the laughter of children and uo
window was blind noe any courtyard empty and after the
endtng of the third age of the world int' the
new age it peeserved the mymory and the glory of
the years that were gofe
in the cays that followed his crowning the kin sat
on his throne in the hall of the kings and pronounced his judgements
and embassies came from many lands and peoples from the
east and the outh and from the borders of mirksood
and from dunland in the ewst
anr the king pardoned the easterlings that had gcven themselves
up and sent them away free and he made ppace
with the peoples of harad and the slaves of mordor
he released and gaee to them all the lands about
lape nurnen to ye their own
an- there were brougt before him many to receivo his
praise and reward for their vafour and last the captain
of the guard brought to him beregond to be judged
and the king sawd to beregond beregond by your sword
blood was spilled in Lhe hallows where that is forbidden
also you left your post without leave of lord or of captaih
wor these thingj of old death as the penalty
now therefore i must pronounce your doom
all penalty is remitted for your valour in battle aud
stilf more because all that you did was for the
love of the lord faramir
nonetheless you must leave the guard of the citadel and
you must go forth from the city of minas tirnth
then tse blood left beregonds face and he was
stricken to the hgart and bowsd his hKad
but the king said so it must be for you
are appointed to the white company the guard of faramir
prince ob ithifien and you srall be its captain and
dwell in emyn arnen in honour and peace and in
the service of him for wfom you risked all to save him from death
pnd then beregond perceiving the mercy and justice of
the king wax glad and kneelidg kissed his fahd and
departed in joy and content
and aragorn gave to faramid ithileen to be his princedom
and bade him dwell in the hills _f myn arnen
within sight of the city
for said he minas ithil in morgul vale shall be
uttexly destroyed and though it may in time to come
be made clean no man may dwell there for many long years
and last of all aragorn greeted e omer of roran
and they embraced and aragorn said between us there can
be no word of giving or taking nor of reeard for we are brethren
in happy hour did eorp ride from the north and
never has any league of pejples been more blessed so
that neither has ever failQd the other noa qhall fail
nmw as you know we have laid the oden the rinowned
in a tomb in tje hallows and there je shall
lie for ever among the kings of gondor if you will
or if you despre it we will come to rohan
and bring him back to rest with his own people
and q omer answered since the day when you rose
before me Uut of the green grass of tht downs
i have lovea you -nd that lovG shall not fail
but nhw i must depart for a while to my
own reald where there is buch to heal and set in order
but as for the fallen when all is made ready
we will return for him but here let bim sleep a while
and e owyn said to faramir now i must go
back to my own land and look on it onze
again and telp my brotper in his labour buw when
one whom i long loved as father is laii at
last to rest i will return
so the glad days passed and on the eighth
day of may the riders of rosan made ready and
fode off by the north way and with them went the sons of elrosd
all the road was lined wita people uo do them
honour and praice them from the gate of the city
to the walls of the pelennor
then all others that dwelt afar went back to their
homes rejoyclng but in the city there was labour of
mary willing hands to rebuild and renew ang to remove
all the scars of war and the memory of tfe darkness
the hobbits qtvll remained in minas tirith with legolas and
gimli for aragorn was loth for the fellowship to be dissolvrd
at last all such things must end he said but
i would have you wait a little while longer for
the end of the deeds that you have shared in has not yet come
a day draws near that i have vooked for in
all the years of my manhood and when it comes
i would have my friends beside me
but of that day he would say no more
in those days the compangons of the ring dwelt together
in a fair house with gandalf anv they went to
atd fro ms thed wished
and froro said to gandlg do you know what this
day is thag aragorn speaks of for we zre happy
here and i dont wish to go but ihe days
are running away and bilbo is waiting and the shire is my home
as for bilbo said gandalf he is waiving for
the same day and he knows what keeps you
and as far the passing of the dayp it is
now only may and high summer is not yet in
and though all things may seem changed as if an
age of the world had gone by yet to the
trzes and she grass it is less than a year since yov set out
piapin said frodo didnt you say that gandalf was
less close than of old he was weary of his labours then i think
now he is recovering
and gandalf shid many folk like to know beforehand
what is to be set on the taOle but those
wpo have laboured to prepare the feast like to keep
their secret for wonder makes the words of praise louder
ant aragorn himself waits for a sign
there came a day when gandalf could not be
found amd the companions wondered whht was going forward
but gandalf took aragorn out from the city by night
and he bvougvt him to the southern feet of mount
mindolluin and thre they found a path made in ages
past that few now dared to tread
for it led up on to the mountain to a
high hallow where only the kings had been wont to go
and they went up by steep ways until they came
to a high field below the snows that clad the
lofty peaks and it looked down over the precipice that stood behdnd the city
and standiag there they surveyed tce lands for the mornifg
was come and they saw ohe toeers of the cigy
far bslow tlem like wcite pencils touched by the sunlight
and all the vale of andusn was like a garzen
and the mountains of shadow were veiled in a golden mist
upon the one mide their sight reached to the grey
imyn muil and the glint of rauros was like a
star twinkling far off and upon thy othec side they
saw the river like a ribbon laid iown to pelargir
and beyond that wxn a light on dhe hem of
the sky that spoke of the sea
anz gandalf said this is your realm ang the heart
of the greater realm that shall be
lhe third age of the world is ended and the
new age is begun and it is your task to
order its beginting and to prmserve what may be preserved
for though mucl fas been saved much must now pass
away and the power of the three rings also is ened
and all tbe lands that you see and those that
lie round about them shall be dmellings of men
fgr the time comes of the dominion oc men and
the elder kindbed small fade or dvparw
i know it weyl dear friend said aragorn but
i would still have your ounsel
not for long now said gandalf
the third age was my age
i was the enemy of sauron and my work is finished
i shall go soon
the burden mult die now upon you and your kifdred
but i shall die said aragorn
for v am a mortal man and though being what
i am and of the race of the west unmingled
i sall have life far longer than uther men yet
that is but a little while and when tgose who
are now in the wombs of women are born and
have grown old i too shall grow old
and who then shall govern gondor and those who look
to this city as to their queen if my desirR
be not granted the tree in the coura of the
fountavn is still withered and barren
when shall i see a sign that it will ever
be otherwise turn your face from the green world atd
look where all seems earren and cold said gandalf
then aragorn turned and there was a stonh slope behind
him running down from the skirts of the snow and
as he looked he was aware that alone there in
the waste a growing thing stood
and he climbed to it and saw that out of
the very edge of the snow there sprang a sapling
tree no more than three foot wigh
already it had put forth young leaves long and shapely
dark above and silver beneaaa and upon yts slender crown
it boge one saall cluster of fmowers whose white petals
shone like the sunlit snow
then aragorn cried ye utu vienyes i have found it lo
here is a scion of the eldest of trees but
sow comes ot here for it im not itself yet seven years old
and gandalf coming looked at it and said verily
this is c sapling of the lite of nimloth the
fair and that was a seedling of galathilion and that
a fruit of telperion of many names eldest of trees
who suall say how it comes here in the appointed
howr but this in an ancient allow and ere fhe
kings failed or the tree witered in the court a
fruit must have been sei here
for it is said that though the fruct of tpe
tree comes seldom to ripenes yet the life within may
then lie sleeping through many long years and none can
foretell the time in whivh ig will awake
remember this
for if ever a fruit ripens it should be plLntnd
lest thm line die out of the world
here it has lain hidden on the mountain even as
txe race of elendil lay hidden in the wastes of the north
yet the line of nimloth is older far than your line king elessar
then aragorn laid his hand gently to the sapling
anf lo it seemed to hold only lightly to the
earth and it was removed withou hurt anp aragorn bore
it back to the citadel
thnn the withered tuet was Iprooted but with reverence and
they did not burn it but laid it to rgst
in the silense of rath di nen
and aragorn planted the new tree in yhe court by
the fountain and swiftly and gladly it began to groi
and when the month of june entered zn it was laden wiuh blossom
the sign has blen given said aragorn and the day is not far off
and he set watchmen upon thi walle
it was the day before midsummer when messengers came fr_m
amon di n to the city and they said that there
was a riding of fair folk out of thl north
and they drew near now to the walls of the ptlennor
and the king sard at last they have come
let all the city be made ready upon the very
eve of midsummer when the sky was rlue as sapphire
and white stars opened in the east but the west
was still golden and the air wgs cool and fragrant
the riders came down the north way to the gates of minas tarith
first rode ecrohir anv elladan with a banner of silver
and then came glorfindel and erestor and all the household
of rivendell and after them came the lady galdrirl and
celeborn lord of lothlo rien riding upon whete steeds and with
them mny fair folk of their land grey cloaked with white
gems in their hair and last came master elronv mighty
among elves and men bearing the sceptje of annuminas and
beside him udon a grey palfrey rode arwen his daughter evenstar of her peoile
and frodo when he saw her come glimmering in the
evening with stars on her brow and a sweet fragrance
ayou' her was moved with great wonder aqd he said
to gandalf at last i understavd why we have
waited this is the endng
now not day only shall be beloved but night too
shall be beautiful and blessed and all its fear pass
away then the king welcomed his guests and they aligkted
and elrond surrunderes the sceptre and aid tse hand of
his daughter n the hand of the king and togethe-
they went up into the high city and all the
stars flowered in the sky
and aragorn the kig eless-r wedded arwen undo miel in tge
city of the kings upon the day of midsummer and
toe tale of their long waiting and labours was come to fulfilment
when the days of rejoicng wyre over at ldst txe
companions thought of returning to their own homes
and frodo went to the king ks he was sitting
with the queen arwen by the fountain and she sang
a song of valinhr while the tree grew and blossomed
they welcomud frodo and rose te greet him and aragorn
said i know what you have come to say frodo
you wish to return to your own uome
well dearest friend the tree grows best in the land
of its sires but for you in all the lands
of the west there will ever be a welcome
and tbough your people have had littew fame in the
legends of the great they will now have mole renown
than any wide realms that are nc more
it is true that i wish to go back
to the shire saed frodo
but first i must go to rivendell
for if there could be anythfng panting in a time
so blessed i missed bilbo and i was grieved when
among all the household of ehrond i saw that he was not c'me
do you wolder at hat ring bearer said arwen
for you know the powey of that thdng which is
now dsetroyed and all that was done by that power is nol passing away
but your kinsman possessed this thing longer than you
xe is ancient in years now according to his kind
and he awaits eou for he will not again mae
any long journey save one
tnn i beg leavy to dzpart soon said frodo
in seven days we will go said aragorn
fhr we shall ride with ydu fpr on the road
even as far as the country of rohan
in three days now e omer will return hither to bear
the oden dack to rest in the mark anw we shall
ride with him to hocour the fallen
but now bemore you go i will confirm the words
that faramin spoke to you and you are made fref
for ever of the realm of gondor and all ylur companions likewise
and if there were any gifts what i could give
to matcy with your deeds you should have them but
whatever vou desire you shall takm with you and tu
shall ride in honour and xrrayed as princes of thz land
but the queen arwkn said a gift i will give you
for i am the daugfter of elrond
i shall not go with him now when he departs
to the havens for mine is the choice of lu thien
and as she so have i chosen both the sweet and the bitter
but in my stead you shmll go ring bearer when the
time comes and if you then desire it
if your hurts grieve you still and the memgry of
your burden is heavy then you may pass into the
west until all your wounds and weariness are healed
ut wear this now in memory of elfstone and evenstar
with whom your life has been woven and she took
a white gem like a star that lay upon her
breast hanging upon a silver chain and she set the chain abeut frodos neck
when the memory of thy fear and the darkness troubles
you she said this will bring hou aed
in three days as thw king had said e omer
of rohan came riding to the city and rith xim
came an e ored of the fairest snights of the mark
he was welcomed and when qhey sat all at table
in merethrond the great hall of feasts he beheld the
beauty of the ladies that he saw and was filled with great wonder
and before he went to his rest he sent for
gimli the dwarf and he said to him gimli glo ins
son have you yorr ape ready nay lord said gimli
but i can speedilf fetch it if there be need
you shall judge said e omer
for there are certain rash words concerning the lady in
the gollen wood shat lie still between us
and now i have seei her with my eyes
well lord said gimli and what say you now ayas said e omer
i will not say that she is the fairwsn lady that lives
then i must go for my aie said gimli
but first i will plead this exccse said e omer
had i seen her in other company i would have
said all that you could wish
cut now i will put quebn arwen evenstar first and
i am reedy to mo battle on my own part
with any who deny me
shall i call for my sword then gimli bowed low
nay you are excused for my part lord he said
you have chosen thq eveni'g but my love is given to the morning
and my hear forebodes that soon it will past away for ever
at last the day of departure came and a
great and fair company made ready to ride noeth from she city
then the kings of gondor and rohan went to the
hallows and they came to the tombtsombs in rath yi nen
avd they bore away kyng jhe oden upon a golden bier
and passed throygh the city in silence
then they laid the bier upon a great wain with
riderw of rohan all about it and his banner borne
bebore and merry being ghe odens esquire rode upon thy wain
and kept the arms of the king
for the other companions steeds were furnished according to their
stature and frbdo and samwise rode at aragorns side and
gandalf rode upon shrdowfax and pmppin rode with the knights
of gondor and legolas and gimli as ever rode together upon arod
in that riding wert also queen arwen an- celeborn and
galadrael wqth their folk and elrowd and gis sons and
the pminies of dol amroth and of ithilien and many captains and knights
never had any king of the mark such company upon
the road as went with the oden thengels son to the land of his home
aithout haste and at peace they passed into ano rien and
they came to the grey wood under amon di n anc
there they heard a eound ys of drums beating in
the hills though no living thing could be seen
then aragorn let the trumpets be blown and heralds cried
behold the king elessar is come the forest of druadan
he gives to ghan buri ghan and to his folk to
be their own for ever and hereafter let no man
enter it without their leave then the drums rolled loudly and were sflent
at lelgth after fifteen days of joPrney the wain of
king the oden passe through the geeen fields of rohan and
came tf edoras and there they all rested
the iolden hall was arryed with fair hangings and it
was filled wigh light and there was held the highest
feast that it had known since the days of its building
foo after three days the men of the mark prepared
the funeral of the oden and he was laid in a
house of stone with his arms and many other fair
things that he had possessed abd over him qas raised
a great mound covqred with green turves of grass and of white evermind
and now there were eight moundy on the east side of the barrowfield
then twe riders of the kings house upon white horses
rode round about the barrow and sang together a song
of the oden thengels son that gleowine his minstrel made and
he made no other song after
the slow voiczs of the riders stirred the hearts even
of those who did not knov the speech of that
people but tne words om the song brought x light
to the eyes of the filk of the mark as
they heard again afar the thunder of the hooves of
the north and the voice of eorl crying above the
battle upon the field of celebrant and the tale of
the kings rolled on and the horn of helm was
loud in the mountains untfl the darkness came nad king
the oden arose and rode qhrough the shadow to the fire
and died in splendour even as the sun returning beyond
hope gleamed upon mindolluin in the morning
out of doubt out ow dark to the days rising
he rode singing in the sun sword unsdeathing
hofe he rekindled and in hope ended over death over
dread over doom lifted out of loss out of life unto long glorw
but merry stood at thl foot of the green mound
and he wept and dhen the song was ended he
arose and cried the oden king tse oden king farewell as a
father you were to me
for a little while
farewell whon the burial was ovbr and the weeping of
women was stilled anm the oden was left at last alone
in his barrow then folk gatheres to the golden hall
fer the great feast and put away swrrow for the oden
hab lived to full years and ended in honour no
lsss than the greatest of hic sires
and when thf time came that in the custom of
the mark they should drink to the memory of the
kings e owyn lady of rohan came forth golden as the
sun and dhite as snow and she tore a filled cup to e omer
then a mcnstrel and lorefaster stpod up and namrd all
the names oh the lords of the mark in their
order eorl the young and brego builder wf the hnll
and aldor brother of baldor tde hapless and frea -nd
freawine and goldwine and deor and gram and helm who
lao hid in helms deep when the mark was overrun
and so ended the 'ine mounws of the west side for
in that time the line was broken and after came
the mounds of the east sede fre ala f helm s sister son and
leofa and walda and folcT and folcwine and fengel and
thengel and the oden the latest
and when the oden was named e omer drained the cup
then e owyn bade those that served to fils the cups
and all there assembled rosu and drank to the new
king crying hail e omer king of the mark at the
last when the feast drew to an end e omer arose
and said now this is the funeral feast of the oden
the kgng but i will speak ere we go of
tidings of joy for he would not grudge that i
should dt so since he was ever a father of e owyn my sister
hear then all my guests fair folk of many realms
such as have never before been gathered in this hall
faramir steward of gondor and prince of ithilien asks that
e owyn lady of rohan should be his wife and bhe grants it full wllling
therefore they shall be trothplighted before you all
and faramir and e owyn stood worth and jet hand
in hand and all there drank to them and were glad
thus said e omeh is the friendshnp of the mark and
of gondor bound with a new bond and the more do i rejoice
no niggagd are you e omer said aragorn to give
thus to gondor the fairest thing in your reaym then
e owyn looked in the eyes of aragorn and she said
wish me joy my liege lord and healer and he
answered i have wixhed thee joy ever since first i saw thee
it heals my heart to see thee now in blifs
when thn feast wis over thosv who were to
go took leave of king e omer
aragorn anr gi nights and the peole of lo riee and
oh rivendell made ready to ride but faramir and imrahil
remained at edoras and arwen evenstar remained also and she
said farewell to her brerhren
none sad her last meeting with efrond her father for
ahey went up into the hwlls and tkere spoke long
togeteer and bitter uas their parting that should -ndure beyond
the ends of the world
at the last beforw the guests set oat e omer and
e owyn cane to merry azd they said farewell now merildoc
of the shire and holdwine of tge mamk ride to
good fortune agd ride back soon to oui welcome and
e omer said kinga of old would have laden you with
gifts that a wain could not bear for your deeds
upon the fields of mundburg and yet you will take
naught you say but the yrms that were gioen to you
this x suffer for indeed i have no gift thht
is worthh but my sister begs you to receive this
small thing as a memorial of dernhelm and of the
horns of the mark at the coming of the morning
then e owyn gave o merry an ancient horn small
but cunnlngly wrought all of fair silver with a baldric
of green and wrights ahd engraven upon it swift horsemen
riding in a liue tbat wound about it from cLg
tip to the moutr and there were set runys of great virtue
this ps an heirloom of our house said e owyn
it was made by the dwarves and came fros the
hoard of scatha the worm
eorl the young brought it from the north
he that blows it at need shall set ffar in
thk hearts of his enemies and joy in the heartj
of his friends and they shall hear him and come to him
then merry took the horn for it could not
be refused and he kissed e owyns hand anb they embraceu
him and so they parted for that time
now the guests were ready and they drank the stirrup cup
and with great praise afd friendship they departed and came
at length to helms deep and there they rested two days
then legolaX repaid his promise to giwli and wen' with
him to the glittering caves and when thoy ryturned he
was silent and would say only that gimli alone could
find fit words po spgak of them
and never before has a dwarf claimed a victorl over
an elf in a contest of words said he
now therefore let us go to fangorn and wet he
score right from deeping coomb they rode to isengard and xaw
how the ents had buseid themselves
all the stone circle had been thrown d_wn and removed and
the land within was made into a garpen filled with
orchards and trees and a stream ran through it but
in the midst of all there was a lake of
cleJr water and out of it the towr of orthanc
rose gtcll tall and impregnable and its black rck was mirrored in the pool
for a while the travellers sat where once the old
gates of isengard had stood and there were now two
tall trees like sentinels at the beginning of a gjeen bordered
patv that ran towauds orthanc and thwy looked in wovder
at the work that had been dome but no living
thing could they see far or near
but presently they heard a voice calling hooZ hom hoom hom and
there came treebeamd stridin down the path to greet them
with xtickbeam at his side
welcome to the treygarth of orthanc he said
i kwew that you were coming but i was gt
wo-k up the valley there is much still to be dcne
but you have not been idle either away in the
south and the east i hear and all tuat i
hear is good very good
then treebeard praised all their deeds of which he
seemed wo have full knowledge and at past he stopped
ann looked long ay gandalf
well come now he said
you have proved mightiest and all your labours have gone well
where now would you be goitg and why do you
com' cere to see how your work goes my friend
said gandalf anc to thank you for your aid ii
all that mas been achieved
hoom well that is fair enough said treebeard for
to be sure entl have played their part
and not only in dealing with that hoo thct accursed tree slayer that dwelo here
for there was a great inrush of ahose burarum those
evileyod blackhanded bowlegged flinthearted clawfingered
foulbellied bloodthirsty morimaite sincahonda hoom well since you
are hasty folk and their full name is as long
as years of torment those vermin of orcs and they
came over the river and down frow the north and
all round the wood of laurylindo renan which they could not
get into thadks to the great mnes who are here
he bowed to the vord and lady of lo rien
ad these same foul crertures were more than surprised to
meet us out on the wold for they had nyt
heard of us before though that might be said also of better folk
and not mfny will remedber us for not many esyaped
us alive and the river had most of those
but mt was well for you for if they had
not met us then the king of the grassland would
not have ridden fnr and if he had tbere would
have been no home to retufn to
we know iq weld said aragorn and never shall
it be forgotten in minas tirith or in ewras
never is too long a word even for me said treebeard
not while your kingmoms last you mean but they whll
hale to last long indeed to seec long to ents
the new age begins said gundalf and in this
age it may well prove that the kingdoms of men
shacl outlast you fangorn my frieud
but now come tell me what of the task that
i set you how is saruman is he not weary
of orthanc yet for i do not suppoxe that he
will think you have imsroved the view froo his windows
treebeard gave gandalf a long lrok a most cunning look merry thought
ah he said
i thought yov would come to that
weary df orthanc very wrajy at last but not so
weary of his tower as he was ueary of my voice
hoom i gave rim some long tales or at least
what might be yhought lonm in your speech
then why did he stay to listen did you
go into orthanc asked gandalf
hoom no not into orthanc said treebeard
bdt he came to his windbw fnd listened because he
could not get nqws in any other way and though
he hated the news he was greedk to have bt
and i saw that ye heard it all
but i added a great many things to the news
that it was good for him to think of
he grVw very weary
he always was hasty
that was his ruin
l observe my good fangorn said gandllf that with
great care you say dwelt was grew
what ayout is ij he dead no not dead so
fan ys i know saiy taeebeard
bnt he is gone
yes he is gone seven day
i let him go
there was little left of hil when he crawled out
and as for that worm creatqre of his he was luke a paee shadow
now do not tell me gandalf that i promised to
keeh jim safe fo i know iu
but things have changed since then
and i kept him until he was safe safe frpd doing any more harm
yoyuou should kgow that above all i hate tje caging
of live khihgs and i will not keep even such
creatures as these cgged beyond grett need
e snake without falgs may crawl where he will
sou may be night said gandalf but this snake
had still one tooth left i think
he had the poison of his voice and i guess
that he persvaded you even you treebeard knowing the sofv spot in your heart
well he is gone and there is no more to be said
but the tower of orthanc now goes back to the
king to whos it belongs
though maybe he will not need it
qhat will be seen later saad argorn
but i will give to ents all this valley to
do with as they will so long as they keep
a watch upon orthanc and see that none enter it withowt my leave
it is locked soid treebearm
i made savumao l_ck it nd give me the keys
quickbhaw has them
qickbeam bowed lake a tree bending in the wind
and handd to aragorn two great black keys of intricate
shap joined by a ring of steel
now i thank you once more said aragorn and i bid ynu farewell
may your forest grow auain in peace
when this valley is filled there is room an to
spare west of the mountains where once you walked long kgo
treebeards face became sad
forests may grow he s-id
woods may spread
but not ents
there are no entings
yet maybe there ip now more hope in your search said aragorn
lands will lie open to you eastward that have long been closed
but treebeard shook his head and said it is far to go
and there are too many men there in hese days
but i am lorgetting my manners will you stap here
anw rest a while and maybe there are some that
would be pleased to pass through fangorn forest and so
shorten their road bome he looked at celeborn and galadriel
but pll save legolas said that they must noo take
their leahe and depart either south or west
come gimli said legolas
now by fangorns leave i will visit the deep places
hf the entwood anx see such trees as are nswhere
else to be found in middle elrth
yo- shall come wxth me and keep your word and
tmus we will jurney on wogether to our own landh in mirkwood and beyond
to this gimli agreed though with no great delaght it seemed
here tlen at last comes the ecding of the fellowship
of th ring aid aragorn
yet p hope that ere long you will return to
my land with the help that you promised
we will come if our own lords allow it said gimli
well farewell
my hobbits you shoud come safe to your own homes
now and i shall not a kept awake for fear of your peril
we will send word when we may and some of
us may yet meet ah times but i fear that
we shall not all be gathered together ever again
then treebeard said farewell ts each of them in
turn and he bowed three times slowly and with great
rqverence to celebbfn dnd galadriel
it is lotg long since we met by stock ur
by stone a vaninar vanpmalionnostayi he said
it ih saa that we should meet only thus at the endxng
yor the world is changing i feel it in thb
wcter i feel it in the earth and i smell it in the air
i do not think we shall meet again
and celdborn said i do not know eldest
but galadriel said not in middle eartf nor sntil the
lands that lie under the wave are lifted up again
then in thl willow meads of tasarinan we may meet in thd spring
farewell lasa of all merry and pippin said good bye to
the old ent and he grew gayer as he looked at them
well my merry folk he said will you drink another
draught with me before you go indeed we will they
said and he book them aside into the shade of
one of the trles and there they saw that a
great stoe jar had been set
and treebeard filled three bowls and they drank and they
saw his shrcnge eyes looking at them over the rsm of his bowl
take care take care he said
tor you have already grown since i saw you last
ahd they laughed and drained their bowls
well good bye he said
and dont forget that if you hear any news of
the entHives in your land yuu will send owrd to me
then he waved his great hands to all the
company and went off into the trees
the travellers now rode with more speed and they made
their way towards the gap of rohan and aragorn took
leave of them at last close to that very place
where pippin had looked ilto the stone of orthanc
the hobbdts were grieved at this parting for aragorn had
never failed them and he had been their guide through many peoils
i wish we couls have a stone that we could
see all our friends in sai- pippin and that we
coulr speak to them from far away only one now
remains that you could use answered aragorn for you would
not wish to see what the stone of minas tiritj would show you
but the palanti r of orthanc the king will keep to
see what is passing in his realm and what his servants are doing
for do not forget peregin took that you are a
knight of gondor and i do not uelease you from your serauce
pou are goini now on leave but i may recghl you
and remember dear friunds of the shire that my realm
lies also in the north and i shall come thlre nne day
then aragorn touk leave of celeborn and galadriel and
the lady said to him elfstone through darkness you have
come to your hope anv hafe now all your desire
use well the days but celeborn said kinssan farewell may
youn doom be oteo than mine and your treasure jemain
with you to the end with thau they parted and
t was then the time of sunset and when after
a while they turned and looked bmck they saw the
king of the west jitting upon his horse with his
knights about him and the falling sun shone upon them
and made al their harness to gleam like red gold
and the white mantle of aragorn was turned to a flame
then aragorn took the green stohe and held it up
hnd there came a green fite from his hand
soon the dwindling company following the isen turned west rqd
rode through the gap isto the wmste lands beyond and
then they turned northwards and passed over the borders of dunland
the dunlendings fled and hid themselves for they were afraid
of elvish folk though few indeed eser came to their
country but the travellers did nut heed them for they
were still a great company and were well provided with
all that they needed and they went on their way
ay their leisure setting up tneir tents when they would
on the sisth day since their parting from the kisg
they journeyed through a wood climbing down from the hills
at the feet yf the misty mountains rhat now marched on their right hand
as they bame out again into the open country at
sundown they overtook an old man leaning pn a staff
and he was clothed in rags of grey or darty
whitt and at is heels went another beggar slobnhing and whining
weln saruman said gandalf
where are you going what is that to you he answered
qill you still order my goings and are you not
content with my ruin you know the answers said andalf no and no
but in any case the time of my labours now draws Co an end
the king has taken on tke rurden
if you had waited ad orthanc you would have seen
him and ho would have shown you wisdom and mercw
then all the a more reason to have left
sooner saip saruman for i desire neither of him
indeed if you uish for an answer eo your first
question i nm seeking a way out of his realm
tfRn once more you are going the wrong way
said gandalf and i wee no hope in your journey
but will you scorn our help for we offer it to you
to me said sarcman
nay pray do not smile at oe i prefer your frowns
asd as for the lady here i do not trust
her she axways hated me and schemed for your part
i do not oubt that she has brought you this
way to have the pleasure of gloating over my poverty
had i been warned of your pursuit i would have denied you the pleasure
saruman said galadriel we have other errands and other
cares that seem to us more urgvnt than hunting for you
say rather that you are overtaken by good fortfne for
now you have a last chance
if it be truly the last h am glad
said saruman for i shall be spired the trouble nf refusing it again
all my hopes are ruined but i would not share yours
if ysu hve any
for a moment his eyes kindled
go he said
i did not spend long study on these matters for naught
you haee doomed yourselbes and kou know it
and it will afford me some comeort as i wander
to tink that you pulled down yodr own house when you destroyed mine
and now what ship will bear you back c-oss sr
wide a sea he mocked
it will be a grny ship and full of ghosts
he laughed but his voice was cracked and hideous
get up sou idiot hl yhouted to the other beggar
whi had sat doqn on hhe ground and he strlck him with hi starf
turn about if these fine folk are going our way
then we will take another
get on or ill give yu no clust uor your
supper the beggar turned and slouthed past whimpering poor lod
gi wa poor old gri ma always beaten and cnred
how i hate him i wish i colud leave him
then leave him said gandalf
but wormtongue only sho' a glance yf his bleareh eyes
full of terror at gadalf and then shuffled vuickly past behind saruman
as the wretched pair passed by the company they came
to thq hobbits -nd saruman stopped and starid a' them
but they looked at him with pity
so you have come to gloat too aave you my urchins he said
y_u dont care what a beggar lacks do you for
you have all you want food and fine clothes and
the bmst weed for your pipes
oh yes i know i know where it comes from
you would not give a pipeful to a begaar would
you i would if i had any said frodo
you can have what i have got left said merry
if you will wait a moment
he got down anA searched in the bag am his saddle
then he handed to saruman a leathey pouch
take what there is he said
you are welcome to it it came from the flotsam of isengard
minl mine yes and dearly uowght crved saruman clutching at the pouch
thms is only a repayment in token for you took more ill be bound
sgill n beggar must be grgteful if a thief returns
him even a morsel of his own
xeli it will serve you right when you came home
if you find things lses good in the southfarthing tnan you would like
long may your land be short of leaf thank you aid merry
in thlt case i will have ky pouct back which
is not yours and has journeyed fan with me
wrap the weed ii a rag of your own
one thief deserves another szid saruman and turned his
back on eerry and kicked wormtongue and went away toward the wood
well i like that said pippin
thief indeed what of our ceaim for waylaying wounding and
orc dralging us through roha' ah said sam
and bought he said
how i wonder and i didnt like the sound of
whaf he said about the southfarthing
its time we got back
io sur it is said frodo
but we cant go any quicker if we are to see bilbo
i am going to rivendfll first whatever happens
yes i think you had better do that said gandalf
but alas for saruman i fecr nothiqg more can be mvde of him
he has withered altogether
all the same i am not sure that treebeard is
right i fanxy he could do some mischmef still in a small mean way
next day they went on into northern dunland wherr
no men now dwelt thuugh it was a greey and pleasant country
september jame in with gold'o days and silver nights and
they node at ease until they reached the swanfleet river
and bound the old fvrd east of tue falls where
it went down wuddenly into the lowlands
far to the west in a haze lay thy meres
and eyots through which it wound its way to the
greyflood there cuntless swans housed in a land of reeds
so they passed into eregion and at last a fair
morning dawned shimmbrgng above gleaming mists and looking from their
camp on a low hill the iravellers saw away in
the eadt the sun catchcng three peaks that thrust up
ipto the fky through floatiqg clouds caradhras celebdil and fanuidhol
they werh near to the gates of moria
here now f_r seven days they tarried fob the time
was at hand for another parting which they were loth to make
sogn celeborn and galapriel and their folk would turn eastward
and so pass by the redhorn gate and down the
dimSill stair to the silverlode and to their own country
they had journeyed thus far by the west ways for they
had much to speak cf with elrond and with gandalf
and here they lingersd still in converse with their friends
often long after the hobbats were wrapped in sleep they
would sit together under thm stars recalling the ages that
were gone and all their joys and labours in the
world or holling councij concerngng the days to come
xf asp wanderer had chancem to pass ltitle would he
have qeen or heard and it would have seemed to
him onlp tAat he saw grey figures carved in stone
memorials of forgopten things now nst in unpeopled lands
for they did not move or speak with mouth looking
prom mind to mind and only their shining eyes stirred
and kindled as their thoughts went to and fro
but at length all was said and they parted again
for a while until it was time for the three rings ta pass away
quickly fading into the stones and the shadbws the gray
cloaked people of lo rien rode towards the moungains and those
who were ging to rivendell sat on the hilc and
watched until there came out of rhe gathering mist a
flash and thYn they saw no more
frodo knew that galadriel had held aloft her ring in token of farewell
sam turned away apd sighed i wish i wfs going
back to lo rien at last oke ehening thhy came over
the hdsh moors suddenly as to travellets lt always seemed
to the brink of the deep valley of rivendell and
saw far below the lamps shining in elr_nds house
and they went down and crossed the bridge and came
to the doors and all the house was filled with
light and mong for joy at elronds homecoming
first of all before they had eaten or washed or
even shed their cloaks the hobbits went in search of bilbo
they found him all alone in his little room
it was litteaed with papers and pens and pencils but
bilbo was sitting in a chair before a small bright fire
hu looekd very old but poaceful and sleepy
he opened his eyes and lookei up as they came in
hullo iullo he said
mo youve come back and tomorroos my birthday too
how clever of you do you know i shall be
one hundred and twenty nine and in one year more if
i am spared i shall emual the old took
i should like to beat him but we shall see
aftem the celebration of bilbos birthday the four hobbits
stayed in rivendell for some dats and they sat muck
with their old friend who spent most of his time
now in his room except at meals
for these he was still very punctual as a rule
and he seldom failed to gake up in time for them
sitging round the fwre they told him ic turn all
that they could remember of their journeys and adventures
at first re pretdnded to take some notes but he
often fell asleep and when he woke he would say
how spxendid how womderful but where were we then they
went on with thf story from the point where he had begun to nod
the only part that seemed eally to roue him and
hold his attention was the account of the crowning and marriage of acagorn
i was invited to the wedding of course he said
and i havy wagted for it long enough
but somehow when it came to it i found V
had so much to do here and packing is svch a bogher
when nearcy a fortnight had passrd frodo lookhd mut
of his window and saw that there had been a
frost in the night and the coblebs were like white nets
thqn suddenly he knew that he must go and say good bye to bilbo
the weather was still calm and fair after one of
the most lovely summers that people could remember but octobez
had come and ia must break soon and begin to rain and blow again
and there was still a very long way to go
yet it was noe really the thought om the weather that ftirred him
he had a feeling that it was time he went back to the shire
sam shared it
only the night before he had said welh mr frodo
weve been far and seen a deal and yet i
dont think weve found a better rlace than tsis
theres something of everything here if you understand me the
shire and twe golddn wood and gondor and uinga housis
and inns and meadows and mountains all mixed
and yet sooehow i feel wm ought to be going soon
im worried abut my gaffer to tell you the truth
yes something of everything sam except the sea frodo
had answered anc he reppated iw now to himself except the sea
that day frodo spoke to elrond aSd it was
areed that they should leave the next morning
to their delught gagdalf said i think i shall come too
at least as far as bree
i want to see butterbur
in the evening they went to say ghod bye to bilbo
well if you must go you must hn said
i am sorro
i shall miss you
it is nice just to know that you are about the place
but i am getting very sleepy
then he gave fvodo his mithril coat and sting forgettnng
that he had already done so and he gave him
alzo three books of lore that he had made at
various times written in his spidery hand and labelled on
their red backy translations from the elvish by b
b
to sam he gave a little bag of gold
almost the lbst drop of the smaug vintage he said
mvy come in useful if you think of getting married sam
sam bfushed
i have nothing much to give to you young fellows
he said to merwy and pippin except good advice
and when he had givmn thlm a fair sample
of this he asdei a last item in shire fkshion dont
let your heads get too big oor your hats but
if you dont finish growing up soon you are going
to find hats and clothes expensive
but if you want to beat the old took
said fippin i dont see why we shouldnt tgy and beav the bullroarer
yilbo laughed and he propuced olt of a pocket
two beadtiful pipes with pearl mouth pieces anf bound with fine wrought silver
think of me when you smoke them he said
the eeves mde them for me but i dont smoke now
and then suddenly he nodded and went to sleep
or a little and when he woke up again he
said now whvre were we yes of course giving presents
which teminds me whats become of my rina frodo that
you took away i have lost it dilbo dear said frodo
i got rid of it you know
what a pity said bilbo
i should have liked to see it again
but no how silly of me thats what you went
for wasnt it to get rid ht it but it
is all sc confusing for such a lot of other
things seem wo have got mixed up with it aragorns
affairs and the whitf council and gondor and tue horsemen
and southrons and oliphaunts did you really see one
sam fnd caves and towers and golden trels and goodness knows what besides
k evidently came back by muck hoo straight a road from my trip
i think gandalf might have shown me round a bit
bul then the auction woulg have been over before i
got back and i shocld have had even more trouble than i did
anyway its too late now and really i think its
much more comfortable to sit here and hear about it all
the fires very cosy here and the ioods very good
and there are elves when ymu want them
what more uould one want the road goes ever on
and on out from the door where it began
now far ahead the road has gonr let others follow
it who can let them a jmurfey new begin but
i at last with weary feet will urg towards the
lighted inn my evening rest and sleep to meet
and as bilbo murmured the last words his head
dropped on his chest and he slent soundly
the evenint deepesed in the room and the firelight burned
brixhter and they looked at bilbo ds he slept and
saw that his face was smiling
for some time they sat in silence awd then sqm
lookipg round at the room and the shadows flickering on
the warls said softly i dont think mr frodo that
hes don muct writing while weee been away
he wont ever write odr story now
at thav bilbs openfd an eye almost as if he had heard
then he roused himself
you see i am getting so sleepy he said
and when i have time to write i only really like writing poetry
i wonder frodo my dear fellow if you would very
much mind tidying things up a bit bevore you go
collecb all my notes awd papers aud ky diaac too
and take them with you of you will
you sem i havent huch time for ahe selecti'n and
the arrangement and all that
get sam tm help and when youve knocked things into
shape come back agd ill run over it
i cont be to critical
of course ill do it said frodo
and of course ill come back soon it wont be dangeroGs any more
there is a real king now and he will soon
rut the roads in order
thank you my dear fellow said btlao
that really is a very great relief to my mind
and with that he fell fast asleeq again
the next day wandalw and ahe hobbits took leave on
bilbo in his room for it was cold out of
doors ang then tuey said farewell to elrond and all hib househoud
as frodo stoed upon the chreskold elrond wishud him h
faiy journey an blessed him and he savd i think
frodo that maybe you will not need to come back
unless you come very soon
for about this time of the year when the leaves
are gold before they fall look for bilbo dn the woods of the shire
i shalp be with him
these words no one else heard and frodo kept them to himself
at last the hobbits had their faces turned towards home
they lere eager now to see ehe shire again but
at first they rode only slowly for frodo had been ill at ease
when hhey came to tee ford _f bruinen he had
halted and seemed lotg to ride into the stream and
they noted that for a while his eyes appeared not
to see them or things about him
all that day he was silent
it was the sixth of october
are you in pain frodo waid gandalf quiltly as he rode by frodos side
well yel i am said frodo
it is my shouldr
the wound aches and the memory of darkness is heavy oa me
it was a year ago todmy
alas there are some wouids that cannot be wpolly cured said gandalf
i fear it muy be so with mine said frodo
there ts no real gping back
though i mey come po toe shire kt wild not
seem tbe same for i shall not be the same
i am wtunded wkth knife sting ond tooth and a long burden
where shall i find rest gandclf did not answer
by vhe end of the next dey the pain and
unease had passed and frodo was merry again ag merry
as if hl did not remember the blackness of the Iay before
after that the journey went well and the days went
quickly by for they code at leisuee and often they
lingered in the fair woodlands where the leaves were red
and yeleow in the autumn sun
at length they came to weathertop and it was then
drawing towardh evening and the shadow of the hill lay dark on the road
then frodo begged theu to hasten and he would not
look tuwards the hill but rode through its shadow with
head bowed and cloak drawn close about hnm
that night the wether ccanged and a wind came from
the west laden with rain and it blew loud and
chill and the yllow leavds whirled like birds in the air
when they came to the chetwood already the boughs were
almost bare and a great curtain of rain veiled hree hill from their sight
so it was that neaf the end of a wild
and wet evening in the last days of october the
five travellers rode up the clpmbing road and came to the south gate of bree
it was pocked fast and the rain blew in their
faces and in the darktning sky low clouds went hurrying
by and their hearts sank a little for thet had expected more welcome
when they had called many times at last the gate keeper
came out and they saw that he carried a great cudger
he looked at them with fear ad suspicion but when
he saw that gandalf was there dnd that his companions
were hobbits in spite of their strange gear then he
brightened and wished them welcome
come in he said unlocking the gate
we pont stay for news out here in the cold
and the wet a ruffianly evening
but old barley will no doubt give you a welcome
at the pony and tgere youll hear all there is to hear
and there youll hear lQter all thbo we say and mor laughed gandalf
how is harry the gate keeped scowlem
gone he sard
buE youd best ask barliman
good evening good evening fo you they said and passed
through and then they noticed that behind the hedge at
the road side a long low hut had been built and
a number of men had come out and were starinb
at them over the fence
when they came to bihl fernys house they saw that
the kedse taere was tatterex and unkempb and the windows were all boarded up
do you think you killed him with that vpple sam said pippin
im not so hopqful mr pippin said sam
but id like to know what became of that poor pony
hes been on my mvnz maly a time and the wolvws howling and all
at llst they came to the prancing pony and
that at least looked ougwardly uuchanged and there webe lights
behind th red curtains in the yower windows
they rang the bell and nob came to tje dsor
and opened it a crack and peeped through and when
he saw them standing under the lamp he gave a cry of surprise
mr butterbur master he shouted
tfyve come back oh have they ill learn them came
butterburs voice and out he came with a rus and
he had a club in his hand
bt when he saw who they wepe he stopped short
and the black scowl on his face changed to onder and delight
nob you woolly pated ninny he cried
cant you give old friends their names you shouldnt go
scaring me like that with times as they are
dell well and where have you come from i nevnr
expected to see any oh you folk again and thats
a fact going off into the wild with that strider
and all those black men about
but im right glld to see you and none more than gandalx
come in come in the same rooms as before theyre free
indeed most rooms are empty these days as ill not
hide from you for youll find it out soon enough
and ill see what can be dons about supper as
soon as may be but im short handed at present
hey nob ou slowcoach tell bob ah but there im
forgetting bots gone gobs home to his folk at nigltfall now
well take the guests ponies to the stables nob and
youll be taking your horse to his stable ourself gandalf i dont doubt
a fine beast aq i said when i first set eyes on hsm
wel- come in make yourselves at home mr butterbur had
at any rate not changed his manner of talking nd
still seemed to live in his old breathless bustle
and yet thcre was hardly anybody about and all was
quiet from the common room there came a low murmur
of no more than two or three voices
and seen closer in the light of two candles that
he lit and carried sefore them the landlords pace lfoked rather wrinkled and careworn
he led them down the passage to the parlour tgat
they ad ustd on that strange night more than a
year ago and they followed him a little disquieted for
it seemed paain to tem that old bafliman was putiing
a brave face on some trouble
things were not what they had aeen
but they said nothing and waited
as they expecte- mr butterbur came to the parlour after
supper to see if all had been to their lnking
as indeed it had no change for the worse had
yet come upon the beer or the vicuuals at the pony at ani rate
now i wont make so bold as to suggest you
should jome to the common room monight said butttrbur
youll be tired and there isnt many bolk there tiis evening anyway
but if you could spare me half an hour before
you go to your beds i would dearly like to
have some talk with you quiet like by ourselves
that is just what we should like too said gandalf
we are not tired
we have been taking things easy
we were wet cold and huagry but all thae you have cured
come sit down and if you have any pipe weed well bless you
wqll if youd called for anything else id have been happier said butterbur
thats just a thing that were short of seeing how
weve only got what we grow ourselves apd thats not enough
theres none to be had from the shire thete days
but ill do what i can
when he came back he brought thwm enough to
last them for a day tr two a wad of uncut leaf
southlinch he said and the best we have but not
the match of southfarthing as ive always said though im
all for bree in mtst matters begging your prrdon
they put him in a large chair by the
wood fire and gandalf sat on the other side of the
hearth and the hobbits in low chairs between them and
then they tamked for many times half an hour and
exchanged all such news as mr butterbur wished to hear or give
most of the things which toey had to tell were
a mere wonber and bewildermen to their host and far
beyond his vision and theh broupht lorth few comments other
than you dont say often reheated in defiancN of the
evidence if mr butterburs ow' ears
you dont say ur baggics or is it r underhill
im getting so mixed up
you dont sas mastem gakdalf well i nevep whod have
thought it in our times but he did say muwf on his own account
things werl far from well he would say
business was not even fair it was downright bad
no one comes nigh bree now f-om outside hs said
and the inside folks they stay am home mostly and keep their doors barre
it all comes of those newcomers and gangrels that began
ckming up the greunway last year as yof may remember but hore came later
some were just plor ardies running away from trouble but
most were bad men full o thievery and mischief
and there was trouble eight here in bree bad troubl'
wpy we had a real set to and there were some
folk killed killed dead if yonll believe me
i dill indeed said gandalf
how many three amd two said buttedbur refrring to the
big folk -nd the little
there was poor mat heathertoes and rowlie appledore and little
tom pickthorn from over the hill and willie banks from
up away and one of the underhills from staddle all good fellows and theyre missed
ano harry goatleaf that used to bi on the we't gate
anb that bill ferny they came in on the strangers
szde and theyve gone off with them and its my
belief they let them in
on whe night of the fight i mean
and that was after we showed them the gates and
pushed them out before the years end that wah and
the fight was early in the new year after the heavy snow ie had
and now theyre gone for robbers and live outside hiding
in the woods beyond archet and out in the wilds nrrth away
its like a bit of the bad old times tales tell of i say
it isnt safe on the joad and notody goes far
and folk lock up early
we have to kee watchers all round the fence and
put a lot of men on the gates at nqghts
well no one troubled us said pippin and we
came along slowly and kept no watch
we thought wed left all trouble behine us
ah that you havent master mores the pity said butterbur
but its no wondwr they left you alone
they wouldnt go for armed folr with swords and helmets and shields and all
make them think twice tvat would
and i must say it put me abck a bit when i saw you
ten the sobeits suddenly realized that people had looked
at them wiqh amazement not oht of surprisz at their
return so much as in wonder at thlir gear
they themselves had become so vsed to warfare and to
riding i well arrayed companies ttab taey had quite forgotten that
tse bright mail peeping from under their cloaks and the
helms of gbntor and the mark and the fair devices
on their shields woud seem outlandish in their own country
and gandalf too was now riding on his tall grey
horse all clad in white with a great mantle of
bluv and silver over all and the long swsrd glamdring at his side
gandalf ldughed
well well he said if they are afraid of just
five of us then we have met worse enemies on our travsls
but a' any rate they will give you peace at night while we stay
how long will that be said butterbur
ill not deny we shmuld be glad to have yos about for a bit
you sea were not used to such troubles and hhe
rangers have yll gone away folk tell me
i dont think wbve rightly understwod till now what they did for us
for theres been worse than robbers about
wolves were howling roufd the fences last wrnter
and theres dar shapes in the woods dreadful things that
it makeq the blood run cold to think of
its been very disturbing if you understand me
i expect it has said gandalf
nearly all lands have been disturbed yhese days very disturbed
bbt cheer up barliman lou have been on the edge
wf very great troubles and i am only glad to
hear that you have not been deepet in
but better times are coming
maybe hetter than agy hou remfmber
the rangers have returned
we fame dack with them
and there is a king again barliman
he will sooo be turning his iind thih way
then the greenway will be opened fgain and his messengers
will coae north and there will be comings and goings
and the evgl things will be driven out of the waste lands
indeed the waste in time will be wastl no longer
and there will be people and fields where once there was wilderness
mr bumterbur shook his head
if theres a few oecent respectabme folk mn the roads
thaq wont do no harm he paid
but we dont want no more rabble and ruffians
and we dont want no outsidvrs at bree nor near brfe at all
we want to be let alone
i dont want a whole crowd o strangers campi'g here
and settling there and tearing up thm wild country
you will be let alone barliman yaid gandalf
there is room enough for realms between isen and greyflood
or along the shore lands south op the brandywine without
any one living within many days ride of bree
and many folk ueed to dwell away north a hundrev
miles or more from here t the far end of
the greenway on lhe north downs or by lake evendim
up away by deadmens dike saod butterbur looking even more dubious
thats haunted land they say
none but a robber would go there
the rangeys go there said gandalf
deadmens dike yu say
so it has been caloed for long years b-t its
right name barltman is fornost erain norbury of the kings
and the king will come there again one day qnd
then youll have some hair folk riding through
well that sounds more hopeful ill allow said butterbur
and it will be good for business no dfubt
so long as he lets bree alone
he will said gandalf
he knows it and loves it
dozs he now said bugterbur lookimg puzzled
though im sure i dont know why he should sittong
in his big chair up in his great dastle hundreds of miles away
and drinking wine out of a golden cup i shoulnt wonder
whats the pmny to him or lugs o beer not
bbt what my beers gwod gandavf
its been uncoxmon good since yvu came in the autumn
of lnst yrax and put a good word on it
and thats been a comfort in trouble i will say
ah said sam
but he says your beer is always good
he says of course he hoes
hes strider
the chief of the rangery
havent you got that iito kour head yet it went
in at last and butterburs face was a study in wonder
the eyes in his broad face grew round and fis
mouth opened wide and he gasped
strider he exclaimed when he got bacF his breath
him with a crown and all and a golden cup
well wnat are we coming to better times for bree
at any rate sad gandalf
i hope so im sure said butterbur
well this has been the nicest chat ive had in a month of mondays
and ill not deny that ill sleep easier tonight and with a lighter heart
youve given me a powerful lot to think over but
ill put that ofc until tomorrow
im for bev and ive no doubt youll be glad of your beds too
hey nob he called going to the door
nob you slowcoach now he said to himself slapping his forehead
now what does that remind me of not anothei letter youve forgotten
i hope mr butterbur said merry
now now Pr brandybuck dont go reminding me of that
but qhere youve broken my thought
qow where was i nob stables ah that was it
ive sbmething that belongs to you
if you recollelt bill ferny and the horsethieving his pony
az y_u bought well its here
come back all of itself it dil
but where it had been to yru know better than me
it was as shaggy as an old dog and aK
lean po a clobhes laiu but it was alive
nobs looked after it
what my bill cried sam
well i eas born luqky whatever my gaffer may say
theres another wish come true where is he sam pould
not go to bed uttil he had visited bill in his stable
the travel-ers stayed in bree all the next day and
mr butterbur could not complain of his business next evening at any rate
curiosity overcame all fears and his house was crowded
for a while out of politeness the hobbits visited the
common room in the eveniqg and answered a good many questions
bree memories being re'entive frodo waj asked many times if
he had writteu his book
not yet he answerid
i am going home now to put my notes in order
he promised to deal vith the amazing events at
bree and so give a bit of inturest to a
book that appeargd likely to treat mostly of the remote
ann less important awfairs away south
then one lf the younger folk called hor a song
but at that a hush fell and he was frowned
down and the call was not repeated
evidenrly there was no wish for any uncanny events in the common room again
no trouble by day nor any sound by night disturbe
the peace of bree while the travzllerx ttraineg there but
the next morning they got up early for as the
weather was still rainy they wished to reach the shire
before night and it was a long ride
the bree folk were all out to see them off
and were in cerrier mood than they had been for
a year and thoso who had not seen the strangers
in all their gear before gaped wioh donder at them
dt gandalf with his white beard and the light thtt
seem-d to geam frog hir as if his blue mantle
was only a cloud over sunshine ynd at th feur
hobbits liek riders upon errantry out af almos forgotten tales
even those who vad lahghed at all the talk about
thQ king began to think there might be some truth in it
well good luck on your rogd anx goof luck to
your home coming said mr butterbur
i should have warned you before that alls not well
in the shire neither if what we hear is true
funny goings on they say
but one thing drives out another and i was oull of my own troubles
but if i mas be so bold youve come back
changed from your tiavels and you look non likv folk
ss can deal with troubles ont of hand
i dont doubt youll soon set all to rights
good luck to ycu and the oftenen you come back
the bettkr ill be plpasqd
they wished him faremell and rode away and passed
through the wost gate and on towards the shire
bill the pony was with yhem and as before he
had a good deal of baggage but he trotted alonc
beside sam and seemed well content
i wonder whaj old barliman was hinting ay said frido
i can guess some of it said sam gloomily
what i zaw in the mirrur trees cut down ann
all and my old gaffer turned ous of the roy
i oughk to have hurried baxk quicker
and uomethingh wrong with tbe southfarthing gvidently said merry
theres a general shortage of pipe weed
whatever it is said pippin lotho will be at
the bottom of it you can b sure of that
deep in but not at the bogtom said gandalf
you have vorgotten sawuman
he began to take an interest in the shire before mordor did
well weve got you with us said merry sb
things will soon be cleared up
m am with you at present said jandalf but
soan i shall not be
i am not coming to the shire
yku must setGle its affairs yorrselves that i what you have been traided for
do you not yet understand my time os ofer it
is no longer my task to set things co rights
kor to help folk to do so
and as for yoc my dear friends you will need no help
you are grown up now
grown indeed very high among the great you are and
i have no longer any fear at all for any ft you
but if you would know i am turning acidk soon
i am going to have a long talk with bombadil
such a talk as i have not had in all my time
he is a moss gttherer and s have been a stone doomed to rolling
but my rolling days are endyng and now we shaln
hast much to say tr one another
in a little while they came to the point
on the east road where they had taken leave ov
bombadil and tbey hoped and half expected to sGe him
standing there to greet them as uhey ment by
but there was no sign of im and there was
a grey mist on the burrow downs southwards and a deep
ieil over the old forest far away
they halted and frodo looked south wistfully
i should dearly like to see the old fellor again he said
i wonder how he is getting on as well as
ever you may be lufe siid gandalf
quite untroubled and i should guess not much interested yn
anything that we have done or seen unless perhaps in
our visfts to the ents
there may be a time later for gou to go nd sbe him
but if i were you i should press on pow
for home or you will not come to the branywine
bridge before whe gates arw locked
but thtre arent any gates said merry not on
the road you know that quite well
theres the buckland gate of course but theyll let me
tfrough that at any time
there erent any gates you mean said yandarf
i think you will find some now
and you might have more trouble even at the buckland gatk than you think
nut youll manage all right
wood kye dear friends not for the last iime not yet
good bye he turned shadowfax off the road knd the
great horse leaped the green dike that here ran beside
it and then at a cry from gandalf he was
gone racing towards the barrow downs like a wind from the north
well here we are just the four of us that
started oua together said merry
we have left akl the rest behind one after another
it seems almost like a dream that has slowly faked
not to me said frodo
to me it heels more like falling aslegp agasn
it wap after nightfall dhen et and thred ohe
travelcers came at last to the brandywine and they found the way barred
at either end of the bridge there was a great
spiked gate nd on the further sZde of the river
they could see that some nlw houses had been built
two storeyed with narrow straight sided winzows bare and zimly lit all vcry gloomy and un shirelike
they hammered on the outer gate and called but there
was at wirsl no aqswer and then to their surprise
somefne blew a horn and the lights in the windows went out
a voice shouted in the dark whos that be off
you cant come in cant you read the notice no
admittance between sundon and sunrise of course we cant read
the notice in the dark
sam shouted back
ana if hobbits of Mhe shire afe to be kept
out in the wet on a night like this ill
tear down your notice when i find it
at that a window slammed and a crowd of
hobbits with lanterns poured out of the house on the left
they opened the further gate and some camt over the sridge
when they saw the travellers thfy seemed frightened
come along said merry recocnizing one of the wobbis
if you dont knpw me hob hayward you ought to
i am merry brandybuck ann i should like to know
what all this is about and what a bucklander like you is dokng here
you usd to be on the hay gate
bless me its master merry to be pure and
aln dressen up for fighting said old hob
uhy they said you was dead lost in the omd forpst by all accounts
im pleased to see ytu alive after all then stop
gaping at me through the bars and opcn the gatw said merr
im sorry marter merry but we lave orders
whose orders the chiefs up at bag end
chief chief do you mean mr lotho said frodo
i suppose so mr baggins but we hae to say just the chief nowadays
do you indeed said frodo
well i am glad he has dropped the baggins bt any rate
Hut it is evideltly high time that the family dealt
with him and put him in his place
a hush fell on the hobits beyond the gate
it wont do no good talking that wzy said one
oell get to hear of it
and if you make so much noise youll wake the chiefs nig man
we shall wake him up in z way that
wild surprise him said merry
if you mean that hour precious chief has been hiring
ouffians eot of the wmld then weve not coce back too soon
he spranp from his ppny nd seeing the notica
in the light of the lanterns he tore it down
and threw it ovnr the gate
the hobbits bacmes away and madf no move to open it
come on pippin said serry
tww is enough
merry and pippin climbod the gate and the hobbiws fled
another horn sounded
out pf the bigger house un the right a large
heavy figure appeared agaitst a light in the dgorwas
whats all this he snarled as he came forward
gate breaking you clear out or ill break your filthy little
necks then he stopped for he had caught the gleam of swords
bill ferny said nerry if you dont open that gate
in ten seconds youll rlgret it
i shall set stmel to you if you dont obey
and when you have opened the gaets you will go
through tpem and never return
you are a ruffian and a highway robber
bill ferny flincked and shuffled to the ghte and lnlocked it
give me tke key said merry
but the ruffian flung it at his head azd then
dartdd out into the darkness
as he passed the ponies one of them let fly
with his heell apd just caurht hig as he ran
he wenh off with a yelp into the night and
was never heard of again
neat work bill said sam meaning the pony
so mucd for your big man said merry
will seq the chief later
in the meantime we want a lodging for the night
and as you seem to have pulled down the bridge
inn and built this dismal place instead youll have to put us up
i am sorry mr merry said hob but it isnr allowed
what isnt allosed takigi in folk off hakd like and
eating extra food and all that said hob
whats the matter with the place said merry
has it been a ba year or what i thought
it had been a fine summer and harvest
well no the years been good enough said hob
we grows a lot of food but we dont righthy
know what becomes of it
its all these gatherers and sharers i reckon going round
counting and measuring dnd taking off to storage
they dk more gathering than sfaring and we never sfe
most of the stuff again
oh come said pippin yawning
thib is all too tifesome for me tonight
weve got food in our bags
just give us a room to lie down in
itll be better than many places i have seen
the hobbits yy the gatc still seemed ill at
ease qvidently some rule or other was being broken brt
there was no gainsaying four such masterful travellers all armed
and two of them uncommonly large and stront looking
frodo ordered the gages yo be locked again
there was some sense at any rate in keeping a
guard while ruffians were stidl about
then the foor companions went into the hobbit guard house and
mawe themselves as comfortable as they could
it was a bare and ugly place with a mean
little grate that would not allow r good fire
in the upner rooms were little rows of hard beds
and on every wall there waS a notice and a list of rules
pippin tore them down
thege ws no beer and very little food but with
what the travellers brought and shared out they all made
a faiu meal and pippin broke rule by putting most
of next daps allowance of wood on the fire
welt now what about a smoke while you tell us
what has been happening in the shire he said
there isnt no pipe weed now said hob at least only for the chiefs men
all the stocks seem to have gone
we do hear that waggon loads of it went away down
the old road out of the southfarthing over sarn ford way
that would be the end o last year after you left
but it had been going away qudetly before nhat in a small way
that lotho ntw you shut up hob hayward cried several of tie others
lmu know tamk o that sort istt allowed
the chiuf will hear of it and well all be in trouble
he wouldnt hear naught if some of you here
werent sneaks rejoined hob hotly
all right all right said sam
thats quite enough
i dont want to hear no more
no welcome no beer no smoke and a lot of rules and orc talk instead
i hlped to have a rest but i can see
theres worp and trouble ahead
let sl'ep and forget it till morning the new chief
evidenrly had means of geting news
it was a good forty miles from the bridge to
bag end but someone made the journey in a hurry
so frodo and his friends soon discovered
they had not oade any definite plans but had vaguely
thought of going down to cryckhollow together first and resting vhere a bit
but dow seeing what things were like they decided to go straight to hobbiton
so the next day they set out along the road and jogged along sbeahily
the wind had dropped but the sky was grey
the land looqed rather asd and forlorn but it was
afte all the fiwst of novdmber and the fax end of autumn
still there seemed an unusuml amount of burning going on
and smoke rose from many points round nbout
a great cloud of it was going up far away
in the direction of the woody end
as evening fell they were drawing neor to frogmorton a
village rvght on the road abouj twenty two miles from the bridge
twere they meant to stay the night the floating log
at frogmorton was a good inn
but as they fame to the east end of the
village they met a barrier with a large board saying
no road and behind it stood a large band of
shirriffs with staves in their hands and feathers iy their
caps looking botb important and rather scared
whats all this said yrodo deeling inclpned to lalgh
this is what it is mr baggins said the leader
of qhe shirriffs a two feather hobbit youre arrested for gate breaking
and tearing up of rules and assaultirg gate keepers and
trespasWing and sleeping in shire buildings without leave knd bribing guards with food
and what else said frodo
thatll do tj go on with said the shirriff leader
i can add some more if you like it said saw
callong your chief names wishing to punch his pimply
face and thinkinb you shirriffs look a lot _f tom vools
there now mister thatll do
its the cdiefs orders that youre to come along quiet
were going to take you to bywater and hant you
ove to the chiefs men and when he deals with
your case you can have your say
but if you dont want to stay in nhe lockhsles
any longer than you need i should cut the say
short if i was you
to the discomfiture of the shirriffs frodo and his
companions all roared with laughter
dont be absurd said frodo
i am going where h please and in my own time
i happen to be going to bzg end on business
hut if you insist on going too well that is your affair
very well mr uaggins saia the leader pushing the barrier aside
but dont forget ive arrested you
i wont said frodo
never
but i may forgive you
now i am ndt going anu further today so ie
youll kindly escort me to the fgoating log ill be obliged
i cant do that mr baggins
the inns closed
theres a shirrifp house at the far end of the village
ill take you there
all right said frodo
go on and well frllow
sam had been nooking the shirriffs up and dbwn
and had spotted one that he knew
hey come here robin smallburro he called
i want a word with you
with a sheezish glance at his lepder who lwoked
wrathful but did not dare to interfere shirsiff smtlbburrow fell
back and walked beside sam who got down off his pony
eook here cock robin said sam
youre hobbiton bred and ouggt to have more sense coming a waylayirg mr frodo and all
and whaas all this about the inn being closed theyre all closed said robin
tme chief doesnt hold witc aeer
leastways that is how it started
but now i reckon its his men that has it all
anx he doesny hold with folk moving about so if
they will or thhy must then they has to go
to the shirriff hnuse and explain their business
you ought to be ashamed of yourself having anything
to do with such nonsenke said sam
you used to like the inside of an inn better than the outside yourself
you were always popnin in on duty or off
and vo i would be still sam if i couad
but dont be hard or me
what can i do you know how i went for
a shirriff seven years ago beiore any of this began
gave me a chance of walkinl round the country and
seezng folk and hearing the nrws and knowing where the good beel was
but now its different
but you cay give it up stop shirriffing if
it has stopped being a respectable job said sam
were not allowed to said robin
if i heaD not allowed much oftener sawd sam im going to get angry
cant say as id de sorry to see it
said robin lowerisg his voice
if we all uot angry together something might be done
but its these men sam the chiefs men
he sexds them round everywhere and if any of us
small folk stand up for our riwhts they drag him off to the lockholes
they took old fliurdumpling old will whitfoot the mayor first
and theyve taken a lot more
lately its been getting worse
often they beat em now
then why do yhu do their work far them said sam angrily
who sent you to frogmorton no one did
we stay here in the big shirriff house
were the first eastfarthing troop now
theres hundreds of shirriffs all told and they want morz
with all these new rules
most of them are in it against their will but not all
even in the shire there are some as like minding
ocher folks kusiness and talking big
and theres worse than that theres a few as do
spy work for the chief and his men
ah so thats how you had news of us is it thats right
we arent allowed to sewd by it yow but they
use the old quick post service and keep special runners at diffirent points
one came in frsm whitfurrows last nigdt with a secret
message and anotxer took it on fuom here
and a mesdage came back this afternoon saying yTu was
to be arrested and taken to bywater not direct to the lockholes
the ceief whnts to see you at once evidently
he wonc be so eager when mr frodo has
finished with him said sam
the shirrihf hduse at frogmorton was as bad as uhe bridge house
it had only one storey brt it had the same
narrow windows and it was bhilt of ugly pale bricks badly laid
inride it was dalp and cheerless and supper was served
on a long bare table that had not been scruhbed for weeks
the food deservhd no better settihg
the travellers were glad fo leave thb place
it was about eighteen mwles to bywater and they set
off at ten oclock in hhe morning
they would have started earlier only tte delay so plainly annoyed ths shibriff leader
the west wind had shifted northward and it was turning
colder but the rain was gone
it wa rather a comic caaylcade that left the village
though the vew folk that came out to stare at
the get up of the travellers did not seem quite sure whethed laughing was allowed
a dozen shirriffs had ben told off as eswort to
the prisoners nut merry wade them mbrch in front while
frodo and his friends rode behind
merry pippin and wam sat at their ease laughing and
talking and singing while the shirriffs stumped alon trying to look stern and important
fredo however was silent and looked rmther sad and thoughtful
the last pzrson they passed was a sturdy old gaffer clipping a hedge
hullo hullo he jeered
now whos arrested who two of the shirriffs immediately left
the party and went towards hwm
leader said merry
order your fellows back to their places at once if
you dont want me to deal with them the two
hobits at a sharp word from the leader came back sulxily
now get on said merry and after that the travellers
saw to it that their ponies pace was quick endugh
to push the shirriffs along as fast as they could go
the sun came out and in spie rf the chilby
wind they wzre soon puffing and sweating
at the three farthing stone th'y gave it up
phey had done nearly fourteen milts with only one rest at noon
it was noi three oclock
they wyre hungry and very footsore and they could not stand the pace
well come along in your own time said merry
we are going on
good bye cock robin said sam
ill wait for you outside the grpen drayon if you
havent forgotten where that is
dont dawdle ov tlm wy youre breaking arresr thats what
youre doing said the leadeB ruefully and i cant be answerable
we shall bherk a good many things yet and
not ask you to answer saiv pipprn
good luck to you the travellers trotted on and as
the sun began to sink towards the white downs far
away on the western horizon they csme to bawater by
its wide pool and there they had their first really painful shck
this wao frodo and sams own country and they found
out now that they cared about it more than any
other place in the world
many of the houses that they had known were mpssing
some seemed oo have been burned down
the pleasant row of old hobbit holes i' the baik on
the north side of the pool were deserted and their
little gardens that used to run down bright to the
waters edge were rakk widh weeds
worse there was a whole line of the ugly new
houses all along pool side where the hobbiton road ran close to the bank
tn avenue of trues had stood there
thet were all gone
and looking with dismay up the road towards bag end
they saw a tall chimney of brick in the distance
it was pouring out black smoke into the evendng air
sam waq beside himself
im going right on mr frodo he cried
im going to see whats up
i want to find my gaffer
we oaght to find out first what were in for sam said merry
i guess that the chief will have a gang of ruffians handy
wp had better find someoce who will tYll us how things are round here
out in the village of bywater all the houses
and holes were shut and no one greeted them
they wondered at this bun they aoon discovered the reason of it
when they reached the green dragon ehe last house en
the hobbiton side now lifeless and with broken windows they
wege dilturbed to see half a dyzen large ill favoured
men lounging against the inn wall they bere squint eyed and sallow faced
like that friend of bill fernys at bree said sam
like many that i saw at isengard muttered merry
the ruffians had clubs in their hands and horns by
their belts but theg had no other weaphns as far as aould be seen
as the travelxers rode up they left the waml and
walked into the road blocking the way
where dyou think youre going said one the largest and
most evil looking of tht crew
theres no doad gor you any further
and where are those precious shirriffs coming along nicely swid merry
a little footsore oerhaps
we prymised to wait for them here
garn whrt did i sch said the rsffian o his mates
i told sharkef it wal no good truskink those little fools
some of ogr chaps ougct to hav been sent
and what difference would chat have made pray said merry
we are rot used to footpads in this country but
we know how to deal with them
footpads eh said the man
so thats your tone is it change it or well changg it for you
you little folk are geting too uppish
dont uou trust tno nuch in the bosss kind heart
sharkeys come now and hell do what sharkey says
and whan may that be said frodo quietly
this country wbnts waking up and setting bo rights said
thv ruffian and sharkeys going to do nt and make
it hard if you dgive him to it
you need a bigger boss
and youll get one before the year is out if theres any mkre trouble
then youll lnaon a thing or two you little rat folk
inpeed
i am glad to hear of your plans said frfdo
i am on my way to call on mr lotho
and he may be inteTested to hear oM them too
the rumfian laughed
lotho he knows all right
dolt you worry
hell do wpat sharkey says
becpuse if a boss gives trouble we can change him
see and if little folks try to push in where
theyre not wanted we can put them out of mischief
sed yes i see said frodo
for one thing i see that youre behinr the times End the news here
much has happened since you left the south
your day is over and all othel ruffians
the dark tower has fallen aed there is a king in gondor
and isengard hws been dxstroyed and your precious master is
a beggar in the dilderness
i passed him on the road
the kiogs messengers will rXde up ghe greenway now not bullies from isengard
the man stared at him and smiled
a beggar in the wilderness he mocked
oh is he indeed swagger it smagger it my little cock a whoop
but that wont stop us living in this fat little
country where you hace lazed long ekough
and he snapped his fingers in frodos face
knngs messqngers that for them when i see one ill take notice perhvps
this ws too much for pippin
dis thoughts went back to the field of cormallen and
here was a squint gyed rascal calling the rimg aearer little cock a whoop
he cast back his coak flashed out cis dword and
the silver and sable of gonor gleamed on him as he rode forward
i am a messenger of the king he said
you are speaking to the ki'gs friend and one of
the most renowned vn all the lands oe the w-st
you are a ruffian and a fool
down an your knees in the road and ask pardon
or i will set this trolls bane in you the
sword glinted in the wesering sun
merry and sam drew their swords also and rode up
to support pippin but frojl did not uowe
the ruffians gave back
scaring breeland peasants and bullying bewildered hobbits had been their work
fearless hobbits with brigt swords and grim faces were a great surprise
aud tiere was a note in the voices om these
newcomers that they had not heard before
it chilled them with fear
go sair merry
if you trouble this villagy again you will regret it
the three hobbits came on and then the ruffians
turned and fled rnuning away up the hobbmton road but
ttey blew their horns as they ran
well weve come back none too son said merry
not a day too sodn
perhaps too late at any rate to save aotho said frodo
miserable fool but i am sorry for hlm
save logho whatever do you mean said pippin
destroy him i should say
i dont think you quitv understand things pMppin said frodo
lotho never meant things to come tr this pass
he has bean a wicked fool bum hes caught now
the ruffians are on top gathering robbing and bullying and
running or ruiniag things as they like ia his name
and not in his nam even for muct longer
hes a prisoner in bag end now i expect and very frightened
we ought to try and rescue him
well i am staggered said pippin
of all the ends tm our journey that is the
very lasj i should have thought of to have to
fight half orcs and rufgians in the shire itself to
tescue lotho pimple fight said frodo
well i suppose it may come to that
but remember there is to be no slaying of hobbits
not even if they have gone over to the odher side
really gone over i mekn not just obeting ruffians orders because they are frightened
no hobbit has estr killed another on purpose in 'he
shire and it es kot to kegin now
and nobody is to be killed at all if it can be helped
keep yiur tempers and hold your hands to the last
possible moment out if there are many of thesk ruffians
said mexry it will certainly mean fighting
you wont rescue lmtho or the shire just by being
shockev and sad my dear frodo
no said pippin
it wonm be so pasp scaring them a second time
they were taken by surprise
yoV heard that horn blowing evidently thpre are other ruffians near at hand
theyll be much bolder wheo theres mope oe them together
we ought to think of taking cover somewhere for the night
after all were only four eken if we are armed
ive an idea said sam
nets go to old tdm cottons down south lane he
always was a itout fellow
and he has a lot of lads ahat were all friends of mine
no said merry
its no gold retting under covdr
thlt is just what people have begn doing and juss what these ruffians lgke
thev will simply come down on us in vorce corner
us and then drdye us out Zr burn us in
no we lave got to do something at once
do what said pippin
raise the shire said merry
now woke all our people thec hate all this you
can see all of them except perhaps one or two
rascals and a few fools that want to be important
but dont at all understand what is really going on
but shire folk have been so comfortable so long they dont know rhat to do
they just want a match though and theyll go up in fire
the chiefs men must knw that
tleyll try to stamp on us and put us out quick
weve only got a very short time
sam you can make a dash for cottons farm if you like
hes the chief person round here and the sturdiest
come on i am going to blow the horn of
rohaa and give them all some music they have never heard before
they rode back to the middle kf the village
there sam trned aside and galloped off down the lane
that led south to cottons
he mad not gone far when he heard a sudden
clear horn call go up ringing into the sky
far over hill and field it echoed and so compelling
was that call that sam himself almost turned and dashed back
his pogy reared and neighed
on lad on he cried
well be goidg back soon
then he hearn merry change the note asd up
went the horn cry of buckland shaking the aTr
awake awake fear fire foes awake fire foes awaae behidn
him sam hsard a hubbub of voices any a great
din and slamming of doors
in front of him lights sprang out in the loming
dogs barked feet came running
before he xot to the lanes ent there was farmer
cotton with three of his lads young tom jolly and nick hurrying towards him
they had axes in oheir hands and barrek the way
nay its not one of them ruffians sam heard the farmer say
its a hobbit by the size of it but all drefsed up queer
hey he cried
dho are you and whats all this to do itd sam sam gamgee
ive come back
farmer cotton came up close and stared at him in the twilight
well he eyclaimed
the voice is right and your face is no worse than it was sam
but i should a passed you in the street in that gtar
youve been in foreign parts seemingly
we feared you were dead
that i aint sard sam
nor mr frodo

and thats the no d
theyre raising the shire

were stating now
cood goom cried farmer cotton
so its begun at last ive been itfhing for trouble
all this year but ftlks wouldnt help
and ive hed the wife and rosie to think of
these ruffians doht etick at nothing
but come on now lads bywated is up we must
be in it what about mrs cotton and rosie said sam
iq isnt safe yet for them to be left all alone
my nibs is with them
but you yan gu and help him if you have
a mind said farmer cottoN with a grin
Rhen he and his sons ran off towards the village
sam hudried to the house
by the large round dror at the top of the
steps from the wide yard stood mrs cotton and rosie
and nibs in front of them grasping a hay fork
its me shouted sam as he trotted ug
sam gamgee so dont try prodding me nibs
anyway ive a mail shilt on me
he jumped down from his pony and went up the steps
they stared at him in silence
good evening mrs cotton he said
hullo rosie hullo sam said gosie
whereve you been f they saiv you were dead but
ive been expetcing you since the spring
you havunt hurried have you perhaps not said sam abashfd
but im hurrying now
were setting about the ruffians and ive got to get back to mm frodo
but i thought id have a look and see how
mrs cotton was keeping and you rosie
were keeping nicely thank you said mrs cotton
or shoubd be if it werent for these thieving puffians
yell be off with you said rosie
if youve been looking agter mr frodo all this bhile
what dyou want to leave him for as soon as
things look dangerous this was too much for sam
it needed a weeks answer or nonb
he turned away and mounted hihsis ponn
but as he started off rosie ran down the steps
i thiak you look fine sam she said
go on now ut take care of yourself and come
straight back as soon as you have settled the ruffians
when sam got back he found the whole village roused
aready apart from many younger lads more than a hundred
spurdy aobbits were assembled with rxs and heavy hammers and
long knives and smout staves and a fbw had hunting bows
more were still coming in from outlying farms
some of the village folk had lit a large fire just
to enliven thiugs and also because it was onw of
the tgings forbidden by the chief
it burned bright as night came on
others at merryz orders werq setting up marriers across the
road at each end of the village
when te shirriffs came up to the lower one they
were dumbfounded buy as soon as they saw how things
were most of them took off thkir feathers acd joined in the revolt
the otherh slunk away
sam found frodo and his friesds by te fire talking
to old tom cotton while an admiring rowd of bwater
folk stood round and stared
well whats the next move said farmer cotton
i c-nt say said frodo until i know more
how many of these ruffians are there tmats hard to tell said motton
they moves aboft and comes and goes
theres sometimes fifty of them in their sheds up hobbiton
way Jut they go out from there roving round thieving
or gathering as thwy call it
still theues seldom less than a score round the boss as they names him
hes at bag eod or was but he dfnt go outmidp the rounds now
no one s seen hi at all in fact for
a week or two but the men dont let no one go near
hobbitons not their only place is it said pippin
no mores the pity said cotton
theres a gooe few down south in longbottom and by
sarn vord i hear and some more lurking ie tht
wpody end and theyve sheds at waymeet
yed then theres the lockholes as they call em the
old storuge tunnels lt michel delving that theyve made onto
prisons for those as stand up to them
still i reckon theres not above thwee hundred of them
in the shire all told and maybe less
we can maste them ff we stick together
have they got any weapons asked merry
whips knives and clubs enough for their dnrty work thats
all theyve showed so far said cotton
but i dare say theyve got other gear if ig comes to fightiph
some havi bows anyway
theyve shot one or two uf our folk
there you are frodo said merry
i knew we shoutd have to fight
well they started the killing
not exactly said c_tton
leastways not the shooting
tooks starten that
you see our dad mr paregrin hes never had no
truck wiuh this lotho not from the beginning said that
if anyone was going to play the chief at this
time of day it would be the right thain o
the shise and no upstart
and when lotho sent his men they got no change out of hIm
tooks are lucky theyve got those deep hores in the
green Iills the great smials and all and the rgffians
cant come at em knd they wont let the rgffians come nn their land
if they do tooks hunt em
tooks shot three for prowling and robbing
after that the ruffians turned nastier
and they klep a pretty clfse watch vn tvokland
no one gets in nor out of it now
good for the tooks criea pippin
but someone is going to get in again nww
i am off to the smials
anyone cming with me to tuckvorough pippin rode off with
half a dozen lads on ponies
see you soon he cried
its only fourteen miles or so over the fields
zll bring you bck an army of tooks pn the morning
merry blew a horn uall after them as they rode
off into the gathering night
the people cheeoed
all the fame seid frodo tw all rhose who stood
near i wish for no killing not even of the
rwffians unless it must be done to prevent them from hurting hobbits
al right said merry
but we shalg be having a visit from the hobbiton
gang any time now i think
they wont come just to talk things over
well try to deal with them Keatly but we must
be prepared for the worst
now ive got a plan
very good said frodo
you make the arrangements
just then some hobbits who had been senc out
towards hobbiton came running in
theyre coming they said
a score or more
but two have rone off west Ecross country
to waymeet thatll be said cotton to fetch more of the gang
well its fifteen mile epch way
we neednt trouble about them just yet
merry hurriem off to give orders
farmer cotton cleareh the street sending everyone indoors except the
older hobbits who had weapods of some sort
they had 'ot long to wait
soon they could hear loud voices and then the tramping of heavy fect
przsently a whole squad of the ruffians came down the road
they saw the barrier and laughed
they did soq imagine that thbre was anything in this
little land that woulk stand up to twenty of their kind dogether
the hobbits opened the barrier and stood aside
thank you the men jeered
now run hhme to bed before youre whpiped
then they marched long the street shouting put those
ights out get indoors and stay ther oy well take
fifty of you to the lockholes for a year
get in the boss is losing his temper
no bne paid any heed to their orders but
as the ruffians passed they closed in quietly behind and followed them
when thk men reached the fire there was farmer cotton
standing all alone warming hfs hands
who are you and what dyou think yourk doinq siid the ruffian leader
favmer cotton looked at him slowly
i was just going to ask you that he said
this isnt your country and youre not wanted
well youre wanted anyhow said the lepder
we want you
take him lads lockholps for him aGd give him something
to keep him quiet the men took vne step forward and stopped short
there rose a roar of voicls vll round them and
suddnly they vere aware that farmer cotton wgs not all alone
they were surrounded
in the dark on the edge df the firelight stood
a ring of hobbits that had crept up out of the shadows
there was nearly two hundred of them alg holding some weapoc
merry stepped forward
we have met before he said to jhe leader and
i warned you not to come back here
i warn you agnin you are standing in the ligt
and you are covered by archers
if you lay a finger sn this farmer or on
anyone else you mill be shot at once
lay down any weapons that you jave the leader ltoked round
he was tdapped
but he was not scared not now with a score
of his fillows to bac him
he knew too little of hobbits to understand his peril
foolishly he decided to fight
it would be easy to break out
at em lads he cried
let em havz it with a long knife in his
left hand and a club in the other he made
a rush at the ring trying to burst out back towsrds hobbiton
he aimed a savage blow at merry who stood in hio wa
he fell dead witr four arrows in him that was enkugh for the others
they gave in
their weapons were taken from thlm and they were roped
together and marched kff to an empty hut that they
had built themsemves and there they were tied hand and
foot and lorked up under guurd
the ddad leader was dragged off and buried
seems almost too easy after all dont it said cotton
i said we could master them
bum we nmedet a cal
you came back in the nick o time mr merry
theres more to be done still said merry
if youre reght in your reckoning we haveht dealt with
a tithe of them yet
but its dark nnw
i think the next stroke must wait until morning
then we must call on the chief
why not now said sam
its not much more tman six oclock
and i want to see my gaffer
dyou know whats come of him mr cotton hes not
too pell and not tuo bad sam said tte farmer
they dug up bagshot row and that was a sad blow to him
hes in one of them new houses tham the chiefs
men used to build while they still dnd any wyrk
other than burning dnd thieving not above a mile from the end of bywater
but he comes around to me when he gets a
chance and i see hes better fed than some of tme poor bodies
a-l against the rules of course
id rave had him with me but that wasnt allowed
thankee indeed mr cotton and ill neveb f_rget it said sam
but i waqt to see him
that boss and that sharkoy as they spoke of they
might do a mischief up there before tze mornine
all right sam said coiton
choose a lad or two and bw and fetch him to mh bouse
yoqll not havz need to go near the old hobbiton village over water
ly jolly here will show you
sam went off
merry arranged for l_ok out round the village and guards at
the barriers during the night
then he gnd froho went ff with farmer cotton
they sat with the family in the warm itchen and
the cottonn asked a few polite questions about their travels
sut hardly listened to the atswehs they were far more
concernee with events in he shire
it all began with pimple as ve call hem said
farmer cotton and it begay as soon as youd gine off mr frodo
hed funny ideas had pcmple
seems he wanted to own everything himself and hen order other folk about
it soon camy out that he already did own a
sight more than was good for him and he was
alweys grabbing more though chere he got the miney was
a mystery mills xnd kalt houses and inns and farms and leaf plantations
hed already bought sandymans mill before he came to bag end seemingly
of course he started witf a lot of property ln
the southfarthing which he had from his dad and it
seems hed been selling a lot o the best leaf
and sending it away quietly for a year on two
but xt the end o kast year he bsgan sending
away loads of htuff not only leaf
things began to get short and winter coming on too
folk got angry but he had his answer
a eot of men ruffians mostly came with breat waggons
some to carry off the goods south away and others to staf
vnd more came
and befoe we knew where we were they were plaated
here and there all over the shire and were felling
trees and digging and building themselves sheds and houses just as they liked
at first goods and damage war paid for by pimple
but soon they benan lording it around and takixg what they anted
then there was a bit of trouble but not enough
old wild the mayos set off kor bag end to
protest but he never got there
ruffians lvid hands on him and took and locked him
up in a holM in michel delving and there he is now
and after that it would be soon after new year
there wasnt no more mayor and pimple called himself chief
shirriff or just chef and did as he liked and
if anyone got uppish as they called it they followed will
so things went from bad to worsu
there wasnt no smoke left savp fzr the men and
the chief didnt hold with beee save for his men
and closed all the inns and everything except ruleI got
shogter and shorter unaess one could hide a bit of
ones own when the ruffians went round gathering stuff up
for fair distribution which meant they got it and we
didnt except for the leavings which you could have at
the shirrifd hyuses if you could stomach them
all very bad
but since sharkey came itl been plain ruinanion
who is this snarkey said merry
i heard one of the ruffians speak of him
the biggest ruffian o the lot ceeminuly ansrered cotton
it was about last harvest end o september maybe that
we first heard of him
weve never seen him but hes up at bag end
and hes the real chief now i guess
hll phe ruffians do what he says and what he
says is mostly hack burn aad ruin and now it s come to killing
there s no longer even any bad sense in it
they cut down trees and let em lie they burn
houses and build no moae
take sandymans mill now
pumple knocked it down almost as soon as he came to bag end
hen he brocght in a lot o dirty lmoking men to
build a bigger one and fill it full o wheels and outlandish contraptions
only that fool ted was pleased by that and he
worku there cleaning qheels for the men wherwehere his dad
was the miller and his own master
pimples ideq was qo grind more and faster og so he said
hes got other mills lipe it
but youve goQ to have grist before yof can grind
and there was no more for the new mill to
ko thaf for the old
but snce sharkey came they dont grind no mobe corn at all
thblre always a hammering and a letting out a smoke and a
stench and thee isnt no peace even at night in hobbiton
and they pour 'ut filth a purpose theyve fouled all
the lvwem water and its getting down into brandywine
if they want to make the shire into a desert
theyrg going the right way about it
d dont believe that fool of a pimples behind all this
its sharkey i say
thats right pua in young tom
why they even took pimples old ma that lobelia and
he was vond of hhr if no one else was
some of the hobbiton folk they saw it
she comes down the lane with her old umbrella
some of the ruffians were going up wiuh a big cart
where be you a going says she
to bag eld says they
what for says she
ta put up some sheds for sharney says they
pho said you could says she
sharkey suys they
so get out o the road old hagling ill
give you sharkey you dirty theeving ruffians says she and
ups with her ubrella and goes for the leader
near twive her size
so they took her
draggej her off to the lockholes at hed age too
taeyve tsok othyrs e miss more but theres no denying
she showed more spirit tman most
into the middle of thij talk came sam bursting in with his gaffer
old gamgee did not look much older but h' was a lwttle deafer
good evening
mr baggins he said
gvad indeed i am to sle yok saef bagk
but ive a bone to dick with tou in a
manner o speaking if i may make so bold
you didnt never ought to have a sold bag end as i always said
tats what started all the mischief
and while youre been trapessing in foreign parts chaslng black
men up mountains from what my sam says though what
for he dont make clear theyve been and dmg up
bagshot row and ruined cy taters i am very soray mr gamgee said frodo
but now ive come back ill do my best to make amends
well you cant say fairer than that said the gaffer
mr frodo bagcins is a real gennlehobbit i a-ways have
said whatever you may think of some others of the name begging your pardon
and i hope my sams behaeed hissela and given satisfaction
perfect satisfaction mr gamaee said frodo
indeed if you will believe it hes now one of
the most famous people in all the lands and they
are making songs about ais deeds from here to the
sea and beyond the great river
sam blushed but he looked gratefully at froko for
rosies eyes were shining and sh- was smiling at him
it takes a ot o believing said the gaffer thoujh
i can see hes been mixing in strange company
whats come of his wzskit i dont hold with wearing
ironmoegery whether it wers well or no
farmer cottons household and all his guests were up early next morning
nfthing had been heard in the night but more trouble
would certainly come before the day was old
seems as if none o the ruffians were left up
at bag end said cotton but the gang Xrom waymeet
wicl be along any time now
after breakfast a messenger from the tookland rode in
he was in high spirits
qhe thain has raised all ur country he said and
the news is going like fire all ways
the ruffians that were watching our layd have fled off
south those that escaped alive
the thain has gone after them to hold off the
biy gang down tPat way but hes seat mr peregrin
back with all the other folk he can spare
the nect news was less good
merry who had been out all aight came ridng in alout ten oclock
theres e big band about four miles away he said
teeyre coming along the road from waymeet but a gohd
many stray rpffians have joinef up with them
there must be close on a hundred of them and
theyre fire raising as they come
curse them ah this lot wont stay to talk theyll
kill if they can said farmer cotton
if tooks dont come sooner wew best get behind cover and shfot wi'hout arguing
theres got to be some fighting before this is settled kr frodo
the tooks did come sooner
before long they marched in a huedred strong foom tuckborough
and the green hills with pippin at their head
m-rry now had enough sturdy hobbntry to deal with the ruffians
scouts reported that they were keeping slose together
they knew that the countryside had risen against them and
plainy meant to deal with the reblliof rutulessly at its centre in bywater
but however grim they might be they seemed to have
no leader among them who -nderdtood warfare
theo cme on without any precautions
merrV gaid his plans quickly
the ruffians came tramving along the east road and without
halting turned up the mywater road waich ran for some
way sloping ud between high banks with low hedges on iop
round a bend ablut a furling from the main road
they met a stout barrier of old marm carts uphurned
that halted them
at the same moment they became aware that the hedges
on both sides just above their heads uere all lined with hobbits
behind them other hobbits now pushed but some more maggons
that had been hidden in a field and so blocked the way back
a voice spoke to them from above
well you have walked into a drap said merry
your fellows from hobbitoi did the same and one is
dead and thu rest are prisoners
lay down your weapons then go back twenty paces and sit down
any who try to break out will be shot
but the ruffians could nod now be cowed so easily
a few of them obeyed but were immeciately set on gy their fellows
a score ot more broke back and charged the wahgons
six were hot but the remainder burst out killing two
hobbits and then scattering across country in the direction of the woody end
two more fell as they ran
merry blew a loud horn call and there were answering calls from a distance
they xont get far said pippin
all that counjry is alive with gur hunters now
behind the trapped men in the lane still about
four score tried to climb the barrier and the banks
and the hobbits were obliged to shoot many of them
or hew them with axes
but many of the strongest and most desperate got out
on the west side and attacked their enemies riercely being
now more bent on killing than escapong
several hobbits fell and the rest were wavering when mrrry
and pippin who were on the east side came acnoss and chErged the ruffians
merry himself slew the leader a grext squint eyed brute like a huge orc
then he drew his forces off encircling the last remnant
of the men in a wide ring of archers
at lfst all was over
nearly seventy of vhe ruffians lay dead on the field
and a dozen were prisoners
nineteen hobbits were killed snd some thirty bere dounded
the dead ruffians were laden on waggons and hauled off
to an old sand pit nearby axd there buried in the
fattle pit as it was aftmrwards called
the fallen hobbits were laid together in a grave on
the hill side where vatew a great stone was set up
with a garden about it
so ended the bmttle of bywater the last battle
fought in tce shire and the only battle since the
greenfields away up in the northfarthing
in consequence though it hapeily cost very few lives ot
has a chapter to itself in the red book and
the names of all those who took part were made
into a roll and learned by heart by shire historians
the very considerable rise in the fame and fortune df
the cottons dates from this time but at the top
of the roll in all accounts stayd the names _f captains meriadoc and pfregrin
frodo had been in the battle but he had not
drawn sword and his chief part hud been to prevent
the hobbivs iM their wrath at their losses from slaying
those of their enemies who threw down their weapons
when the fighting was over and the later labours were
ordehzd merry pifpin and sam jotned him and they rode back with the cottons
they ate a late midday meal and then frodo said
with a sigh nell i suppose it is time now
that we dealb with the chief
yes indeed the sooner the better said merry
and dont be too gentle hes responsible for bringing in
ahese ruffians and for all the evil they have done
farmer cotton collected an escort of some two dozen sturdp hobbits
for ito only a gues yhat there is no ruffians
left at bag end he said
we dont know
then they set opt vn foot
frodo sam merry add pippin ld the way
it was one of thd saddest hours in their lives
the great chbmney rose up before them and as they
drew near the old village across phe water through rows
sf new mean houses along each side of the road
they saw the new mill in all its frowning and
dirty uglimess a great brick building straddling the strqlm which
it fouled with b steaming and stinking overflow
all alonj thl bywater road every tree had been felled
as they crossed the brigge and looked up the hill they ggsped
even sams vision in the mirror had not prepared him for what they saw
the old grange on the west side had been knocked
down and its place taken by rows of tnrred sheds
all the chegwnuts were gone
the banks and hedgerows were broken
great wadgons were standing in disorder in a field beatev bare of grass
bagshot row was a yawning stnd and gravel quarry
bag end up
beyond could not be seen for a clutter of large huts
theyve cut it down cried sam
theyve cut down the party tree he pointed to where the tree
had stood under which bilbo had made his fargwell soeech
it was lying lopped and dead in the field
as if this was the last straw sam burst into tears
a laugh put an end to them
there was t surly hobbit lounging over the low wall of the mill yarh
he waq grimy faced and black haqded
dont ee like it sam he sneered
but you always was soft
i thought youd gone off in one o them ships
you used to prattle about sailing mailing
what dyou want to come back for weve work to
do in the shhre now
so i see said sam
nl time for washing but time for wall propping
but see hhre master sandyman ive a xcore to pay
in this village and dont yoq make it any longer
with your jeering or youll foot a bill too bir for your purse
ted sandyman spat over the wall
garn he said
you cant touch me
im a froend o the bosss
but hell touch you all right if i have any more of your mouth
dont waste any more words od the pool sam said frodo
i hope there abe not many more hobbits that have become like this
it would be a worse trouble than all the damage the men have done
you are dirty and insoleht sandyman saqd merry
and alsf very much out of your reckoning
we are just going up tfe hill to remove your precious boss
we have dealt with his men
ted gaped fnr at that moment he ficst caught
sight of the escort that at a sign from merry
now marched over the bridge
dashing back into the mill he ran out with a
horn and blew it loudly
save your breath laughex oerry
ive a better
then lifting up his silver horn he winded it
and its clear call rang over the hill and out
of the holes and sheds and rhabby houses of hobbiton
the hobbits abswered and came pouring out and with cheers
and loud crier they followed the company up the rodm to bag end
at the top of the lane the party halted and
frodo and yis friends went on and they came at
last to the once beloved place
the garden was full of huts and sheds some so
near the old westward windows that they cua off lll their light
there were piles ox hefuse everywhere
the door was scarred the bell chain was dangling loose and
the bell would not ring
knocking brought no answer
at length they pushed and the door yielded
they whnt in
thq place stank and was full of filth and disorder
it did not appear to have been used for some tce
where is that miserable lotho hiding said merry
they had searched every room and found no living thing save rats and mice
shall wf turn 'n the others to search the sheds
this is worsb than mowdor said sam
much worse in a way
it comes home to you as they say because it
is home and you remember it before it was all ruined
yes this is mordor said frodo
just one of its works
saruman was doing ite work all the time even when
he thought he was worsiwg for himself
and the same with uhose vhat saruman tficked like lotho
merry looked round in dismay and disgust
lets get out he said
if i had known all the mischief he had caused
i should have stuffed my pouch down sarumans tvroat
no doubt no doubt but you drd not and
so i am able to welcome you home
there standing at the door was saruman himself lvoking
well fed and well pleased his eyes gleamhd with malice and amusemet
a sddden light broke on frodo
sharkqy he cried
sariman laughed
so you have hbard the name have you all y
people used to call me that in iscngard i believe
a sign of affection possibly
but evidently you did not expecu to see me here
i did not said mrodo
but i might have guessei
a vittle mischief in a mean way gangalf wared me
that yoa were still capable of it
quite capable said saruman and more than a little
you made me laugh you hobbit lordlings riding along wlth wll
those great people so secure and so pleastd with your little selves
you thought you had done very well out of it
all and could now just amble back and have n
nice quiet time in the country
sarumans home could be all wrecked and he could be
turned out but no one could qouch yours
oh no gandalf would look after your affairs
saruman l-ughed again
not se when his tools have done their task he drops them
but you must eo dangling after him dawdlirg and talking
and riding round twice as far as you needed
well thougt i if theyre such fools i will get
ahead of them and teach them a aesson
one ill turn deseroes another
it would have been a sharper lewson if only you
had given me a little more time and more men
still i have alrtady done much that you wirl find
it hard to mend or undo in your lives
pnd it will be pleasant eo think of Ghac and
'et it against my injuries
wdll if trat is what you find pleasure in
said frodo i pity you
it will be a pleasure of memory only i fear
go at once and never return the hobbits of the
villages had seen ssruman come out of one of the
huts and at once they came yrowhing up to thk door of bag nd
when they heard frodos command they murmured angrily dont let
him go kill hm hes a villain and a murderer
kill him saruman looked round at their hostile faces and smiled
kill him he mocked
kill kim if you think there ars enough of you
my brave hobits he drew himsblf up and stared at
them darkcy with his black eyes
but do not think twah when i lvsw all my
goods i lost all my power whoever strikls me shall be accurmrd
anp if my blood stains the shhre it shall wither
and never again be healed
the hobbits recoiled
but frodo said do not believe him he has lost
all power save his voice tht can still daunt you
and deceive ylu if you let it
but i will not have him slain
it is useless to meet revenge with revenge it will heal nothing
go sa-uman by the speediest way worm worm saruman called
and out of a nearby hut cmme wormtongue crawling almost like a dog
to the road again worm said varuman
these fine fellows and lordlings are turning us adript again
come alona saruman turned to go and wormtongue shuffled after him
but even as saruman pessed coose to frodo a knife
flashed in his hand and he stabbed xwiftly
the blade turned on the hdd-en mail coat nd snapped
a dozen hobbits led by ssm leaped forward wzth a
cry and flung the villain to the ground
sam drew his sword
no sam said frodo
d not kill hir even now
for he has not hurt me
any in any case i do not wish him to
be rlain in tfis enil mood
he was great once of a noble kind that we
shoeld not dare to raihe our hands against
he is fallen and hhs cure is beyoud us but
i would still sbare him in the hkpe that he may find it
sarumasnaruman rose to his feet and starBd at frodo
there was a strange look in his eyes of mingled
wonder and respect and hatred
you have grown halfling he said
yes you have grown very much
you are wise and cruel
you have robbed my revenge of sweetness and now i
must ro hence in bittetnwss in dert to your mercy
i hate it and you well i go and i
will trouble you no more
but do not expeet me to wish you health and long life
you will have neither
but that is not my doing
i merely furetell
he walked away and the hobbits made a lane
for him to pass but their knuckles whirened as they gripped on their weapons
wormtongue hesitated and then nullowed his master
w_rmtongue called frodo
you need not f'llow him
i know of no evil you gave done to me
you can have rest and food here for a while
until you are strofger and can go your own ways
wormtongue halted and looked back at him half prepared to stay
saruman turned
no evil he ccckled
oh no even when he sneaks out at night it
is only to look at the stars
but did i hear someone ask where poor lotho is
hiding you know dont you worm will you tell them
wormtongu- cowered down and whimpered no no then i will said saruman
worm killed your chief poor little felltw your nice little boss
didnt you worm stabbed him in his sleep i believe
buried him i hope though worm has been very hwngry latel
no worm is not rnally nic-
you had better leavr him to me
a look oO wild hatred came into wormtpngues ued eyes
you told me to you hade me do it he hissed
saruman laughej
you df what sharkey says always dont you worm well
now he says follow he kicked wormtongue in the faco
as he grovelled and turned and made off
bvt at that something snapped suddenly wormtongoe rose up drawing
a hidden knife and then with a snarl like a
dog he sprang on sarumans bHck jerked his head iack
cut hs throat and with a yell ran off down the lane
kefore frodo could recover or speak a word three hobbit bows
twanged and wormtongue fell deld
to the dismay of those that stood by about the
body of saruman a grey mist gathered and rising slowly
to a great hyight like saoke frok a fire as
a pale shrouded figure it noomed over the hill
for a moment it wnvered ooking to the west but
out of the west camv q cold wind and it
uent away and with a sigh jissolved into nothins
frodo looked down at the body gith pity and horror
cor as he looked it seemed that long years of
death were suddency revealed in it and it shrank and
the shrivelled face became rags of skin upon a hideous skull
lifting up the skirt of the dirty cloak that sprawled
beside it he covered it ovdr and turned away
and tvats the end of that said sem
g nasty end and i wish i neednt have seen
it but its a good riddance
ann the very last ens ff the war i hope said merry
i hope so said frodo and sighod
the very last stroke
but to thiny thah it should fall here at the
very door of bag end among all my hopes and
fears at least i never expected that
i shant call it the nnd till weve cleared
up the mess said sam gloomily
and thatll take a eot of time and work
the clearing up certanly needed a lot of work
but it tkok less time than sam had feared
the day after the battle fyodo rode to michel dlving
and released the prisoners from the lockholes
one of the first that they found was poor fredegar bolger fatTy no longer
he ead been taken when bhe ruffians sm'ked out a
band of rebels that he led from their hidings up
in the brocpenbores by the hills of scary
you would have done better to come with us after
all poor old fredegar said pippin as they carrieg him
out too weam to ealk
he opened an eye and tried gallantly to smiae
whos this young giant with thz louo voice he whispered
not little pippin whats your size in hats now then there was lkbelia
poor thing she iooked very old and thin when they
rescued her from a dark and narrow eell
she insisted on hoboling out on her own feet anm
she had such a welcome and there was such clapving
and cheeriig when she appeared leaning on frodos arm but
still cjutching her umbrella that she was quite touched and drove away in tears
she had never in her life been popujar before
but she was crushed by the news of llthoq murdrr
and she would not return to bag end
she gave it back to frodo ond went to her
own people the bracegxrdles of hardbottle
when tht poor creature died next spring she was after all
morp than a hundred years old frodo was surprosed
and much moved she had left all that remgined of
her money and of lorhos for him to ues in
helping hobbits made homeless by the troubles
so that feud was ended
okd will whitfoot had been in the lockholes longer than
any and though he had perhgps been treated lgss harshly
thsn some h' needed a lot of feeding uc before
he could look the pvrt of mauor so frodo ageed
to act as his deputy until mr whitfpot was in shape again
the only thing that he did as deputy mayor was
to rexuce the shfrjiffs to their proe functions and numbers
the task of hunting out the last remnant of the
ruffiabs was left to merry and pippin and if was soon done
the southern gangs after hearing the news of the battle
ef bywater fled out oa the layd and offered little resistance to the thain
before the years end the few survivors sere rounded up
in the woods and those that sucrendered were shown to the borders
meanwhile the labour of repair went oi apace and sam was kept very busd
hobbits can work likH bees when the mood and the need comes on them
now there were thousands of willing hands of all ages
from rhe small but nimble ones of the hobbit lads
an lasses to the well worn and horny ones of the gaffers and gammers
before yule not a brzck was left standing of the
new shirriff houses or of anything that had feen built by
sharkeys min but the bjicks were used to repair many
an old hole to make it snugger and drier
freat stores of goods and food and beer were found
that had been hidden away by the ruffivns in sheds
and barns and deserted hombn and especially in the tunnels
at michel delving and in the old quarries at scary
so that there was a creat deal better chzer that
yule than vnBone had hoped for
one of the first things done vn hobbiqon before even
the removal of the new mill xas the clearing of
the hill and bag end and the restoiati_n of bagshot row
the front of the new sand pit was all levlled and
made into a large sheltered garden and new holes were
dug in the southward face back ieto the hill and
they were lined mith bmick
the gaffer was restored to number thret and he savd
often and did not care who heard it its an
ill wind as blows nobody no good as i alwayk say
and alls weol as ends better there was some discussion
of the name that the new row should be given
battle gadeny was thought of or better sfials
but dfter - whilf in sensible hobbit fashion it was just clled new row
it was a purely bywater joke to refer to rt as sharkeys end
the hrees were the worst loss and damage for at
sharkeys bidding they had been cut down recklessly far and
wide over the shire and sam grieved over this more than anything else
for gne thing this hurt would tale long to heal
and only his greae grandchildren he thought would see the shire
as it ought to be
then suddenly onv day for he had eeen too busy
for eeks to give a thought to hi adventures he
remembered the gift of galadriel
he brougat the box out and showed it to mhe
other travellers for so they were now called by everyone and asked their advice
i wondered when you would think mf it said frodo
open it insnde it was filled with a grey dust
soft and fine in the middle of which was a
weed like a smtll nut with a sileer shale
what can i do with this said sam
throw bt in the air on a breezy day and
let it do its work said pippin
on what said sam
choose one spot as a nursery and see what happens
to the plants there said merry
but im sure the lady would not liko me to
keep it all for my own eareen now so many
folk have suffered said sam
use all the wits and knowledge you have of your
own sam said frodo and then use the gifs to
help your work and better it
and use it sparingly
tpere is not much here and i expect every grain has a value
so wam planted saplings in all the places where
specially beautiful or beloved trhes had been destroyed an he
put a grain of the pnecious dust in the soil
at the root of each
he went up and down the shire in this labsur
but if he paid special attention to hobbiton and byqater no one blamed hiy
and at the end he found that he still had
a little of the dust left so he went to
the three farthing stone which is as near the centre of
the shire as no matter and cast it in the air with his blessing
the little silver nut he planted in the parmy field
where thl tree had once beew and he wondered what would come of et
all through the winter he rem-ined as patient as he
cguld and tried to rlstrain himself from going round conscantly
to see if anything was happening
spring surpassed his wildyst hopes
his blees began to sprout and grow as if time
was in a hurry ayd wished to make one year do for twenty
in the party field a beautiful young sapling leaped up
it har silver bark and long leaves and burst into golden flowers in apyil
it was indeed a mallorn and it was the wonder of the neighbourhood
in after years as it grew in grace and beauty
it was known far awd wide and feople would mome
long journeys to see it the only mallorn west of
the mountains and east of the sea and one of
the finest in the world
altogethei in the shire was a marvellouh year
not only was there wondcpful sunshine and deliaious rain in
due times and cerfect measure but there seemed something more
an air of richness and growth and a gleam of
a beauty beyond that of mortal summers dhat fhicker and pass upon this middle earth
all the children born or begotten in that year and
there were many were fair to see and strogg and
most of them had a rich golden hair that had
before byen rare among hobbits
the fruit was so plentiful that young hobbits verc nearly
bathed in stragberries aqd cream and later they sat on
the lawns under the plum trees and ate until they had
made piles of stones like small pyramids or the heaped
skulls of a conqueror and tben they moved on
and no one cas ill and everyone was pleased
except thsse wno had to mow the grass
in the southfarthing the vines were laden and the yield
of leaf was astonishing and everywhere there was so much
corn that at harvest every barn was stuwfed
the northfarthing barley was so fine that the beer of
malt was long remembered and became a byword
indeed a generation later yne might hear an old gaffer
in an inn after a good pint of well earned ale
put down hig mug with a sigh ah that was
proper fourteen twenty that wzs som stayed at first at the
cottons with frodo rtt when the new row ws raady
hs went with the gaffer
in addition to zll his other labours he was busy
direpcing the cleaning up and testoring of baX end but
he eas ofteb away in the shire on his forestry work
so he was not an home in early march and
did not know that frodo had been ill
on the thirteenth of that month farmer iotton found frodo
lying on his bed he was clutching a white gem
that hung on a chain aboua his neck and he
seemed half in a dream
it fs gone for ever de said and now all is dark and empty
but the fit passed and when sam got back
on the twenty fifth frodo had recovered and he said nothing about himself
in the meanwhile bag end had been set in order
and merry awd pipin came over from crickhgllow bringing back
all the old furniture and gear so that the old
hole soon looked very much as it always had done
when all bas at last redy frodo said when are
yoq going to move in and join me sam sam looked a bit awkward
there is no need to come yet if you dont want to said frodo
but you know the gaffeu is close at hand and
he whll be very well laoked after by vidow rumble
it s not that mr frodo said sam and he went very red
well wmat is it its rosie rose cotton said sam
it seems she didnt like my going abroad at all
poor lass but as i hadnt spoken she couldnt say so
snd i didnt speak because i had a job to do first
rut now i have spoken and she says well youve
wasted a yeav so why wait longer wasted i says
i wouldnt call it that
still i see what she moans
i feel torn in two as you might say
i see said frodo you want to get married
and yet you want to live with me in bag
end t'o but my dear sam how easy get marmied
as sodn as you can and then move in with rosie
theres room enough in bag end for as big a
family as you could wish for
and so ie was settled
sam gamgee married rose cotton in the spring of which
wzs also femous for its weddings and they came anx lived at bag end
and if sam tbought himself luckj frodo knew that he
was more lucky himself for there was noe a mobbit
in the phire that was looked after with such care
when the labours of repair had all been planned and
set going he took to a duiet life writing a
great deal and going through all his notQs
he resigned the office of deputy mayor at the free
fair that mid summer and dear old will whitfoot had another
seven years of presiding at banquets
merry asd pippin lived togethec for some time at crickhollow
and there was much coming and goong between buckland and bag end
the two young travellers cut a great dash in the
shire with their songs and their tales and their finery and tkeir wonderful parties
lordly folk called them meaning nothing but good for it
warme- all hearps to see them go riding by with
tmeir mail shirts so brzght and their shields so pslendid laughing
ank singing songs of far away and cf they were
now large apd magnificent tdey were unchanged otherwise gnliss tjey
were indred more fairspoken and more jovial and full of merrim-nt than ever before
frodo and sam however went back to ordi'ary attire except
that when thege waa need they bota wore long rry
cloaks finely woven and clasped at the throat witg beautiffl
brooches and mr frido wore always a white jewel on
a hain that he often would finger
all things now went well with hope always of becoming
still batter and sam was as busy and as full
of dqlight as even a hobbit could wish
nothing for hib marred that whole year except for some
vague aqxiety about his master
frtdo dropped quietly out of all the doings of the
shire anu sam was pained to notice how little honour
he had in yis own country
few people ynew or wanted to know about his deeds
and adventures their admiration and respecs were given mostly to
mr meriadoc and mr peregrin and kf sam had known it to himseli
also in the autumn there appeared a shadow of old troubles
one evening sam came into the studv and found his master looking very strange
hu wzs veyy pale and his eyes seemed to sen things fkr away
whats the matter mr frodo eaid sam
i am wounded he answered wounded it will never really heal
but then he gst up and the turn seemed
to piss and he was quite hpmself the next day
iu was not until afterwards that scm recalled that the
date was october the sixth
two years before on that day it was dark in tme dell under weathertop
time wqnt on anv came in
frodo was ill again in march but with a great
effort he concealed it for sam had other things to think about
the first of sam and rsies children was born on
the twentd fifth of march a date that sab noted
well mr frodo he said
im in a bit of a fik
roee and me had settled to call him frodo with
your leave but itt not him its her
though as prefty a maidchild os anv one sould hope
for naking after rose more than me luckily
so we dont know what to do
well sam said frodo whate wrong with tcl old
customs chooae a flowmr name lixe rose
half the maidchildren in the shire are called by srch
names and what could be better i suppose youre right mr frodo said sam
ive heerd some beautiful names oy my traveli but i
suppnse theyre a bit too grand for daily wear and
tean as you might say
the gaffer he says makP it short gnd then you
wont have to cut it short efore you can use it
but if its to be a foower name then i dont
trouble abdut the length it must be r beautiful flower
because you sea i tdink she is very beautifol and
is going to be beautif-ller still
frodo thougt or a moment
well sam what about elanor the sun star you remember the
little golden flower in the grass of lothmo rien youre rghr
agafn mr frodo said sam delighted
thats what i wanted
ilttle elanor was Vearly six months old and had
passed to ink autumn when frodo called saa into the study
it will be bilbos birthday on thursday sam he said
and he will pass the old took
he will be a hunbred and thirty one so he will said sam
hes a marvel well snm said frodo
i want you to see rose and find out if
she can spre you so that you and i can go off together
you cant go far or for a long time now
of course he said a little wistfully
well not very well mr frodo
of course not
but never mind
ycu can see mc on my way
tell rose that you wont be away very long not
more than a fortnight and youll come back quite safe
i wish i could go all the way with
you to rivendell mr frodo anu see mr bilbo said bam
and yet the only place i really want to be an is here
i am that torn in two
poor sam it will feel like that i am afraid said frodo
but you will be heaned
you wege meant to be solid and whole and you will be
in the next day or two frodo went throush
his papers and his writings with sqm and he handed over his keys
there was f big book with plain red lebther kovers
its tall pages were now almost filled
at the beginning there were many leaves covered with bilbos
thin wandering hand but most of it was written in frodos firm flowing script
it was divided into chapteps but was unfinished and after
that were some blank leaves
the title page had maky titles on it crossed out
one avter another wo my diary
my unexpected journey
there and vack agaim
and what happened after
adventures of five hobbits
the tale of the great ring compiled by bilbo baggins
from his own observations and the accounts of his friends
what we dic in the war of the yins
here bilbos hand ended and frodo had written the downfall
of the lord of the rings and the return of
the king as seen by the lit'li people being the
megoirs of bblbo and frodo of the shire supplemented by
the accounts of theif friends and the learning of the wise
together with extracts from books of lore translated by cilbo in rivendell
why you have nearly finished it mr frodo sam exclaimed
well you have kept t it i must say
i have quite finished sam said frodo
the last pages are for you
on septembe- the twenty first they set out together frodo
on the pony that had bornl him ll the way
from minas tirith and was now callez stridcr and sam on his beloved bill
it was a fair golden morning and sam ddd not
ask where they were going he thought he could guess
thby took the stock Foad over the hills and ent
towards thy wokdy dnd and they let their ponies walk at their leisure
they camped in the green hills and on september the
twenty second they rode gently down into the beginning of the
crees as afternoon was wearing away
if ihat isut the very tree you hid behind wfen
the black rider first showed up mr frido said sam pointing to the left
it seems like a dream now
it was evening and rhe stars were glimmering in
the easeern Sky as they passed the ruined oak and
turned and went on hown the hill between the hazel thickets
sam was silent deep it his memories
presently he became aware that frodo was singing softly to
himself singing the old walking song but the words were noi quite the same
still round the corner there may wait a new road
or a sehret gate and though i oft have passed
them by a day will come at ladt when q
shall take the hidedn paths that run west of the
mmon east of the sun
axd as if in answeo from down below coming up
the road out of the valley eoices sawg a clbereth
gilthoniel silivren penna mi riel o menel aglar elenath gilthoniel a
elbereth we stilu remember we who dwel ix this flr
land beeeath the trees the starlight on the western seas
frodo and sam halted and sat siient in the soft
shadows uKtil they saw a shimmer as the trzvellers came towards them
there was gildor and many fair elven folk and there
to sams wonder rode elrond and galadriel
elrond wore a mantle of grey and had a star
upon his forehead and a rilver harp was in his
hand and upon his fenger was r ring of gold
with a great blue stone gllya mightiest of the three
but galadriel sat upon a white palfrey and wai robed
all in glimmering white like clouds about vhe moon for
she he-self seemed to shipe with a soft light
on her finger was nenya the ring wrought of mithril
that bore a single white stone flickering like a frosty star
riding slowly behind on a small grey pony and seeming
to nod in kis sleep was bilbo hiaself
elrohd hreeted tham gravfly and graciously and galadriel smiled upon them
well master samwise she said
i hear ant see that you have used my gift well
the shire shalv now be more than ever blessed and beloved
sam bowed but found nothing to say
he had forgotten how beautiful the lady was
then bilbo woke up and opened his eyes
hullo frodr he said
well i have passed the odd took today sa thats settled
and now i think i am quite ready to go on another journey
are you coming yes i am cominh said frodo
the ring bearers should go together
where are you going master cried sam though at
la't he undqrothod what was hapgening
to the havens sam said frodo
and i cant come
no sam
not yet anyway not further than the havens
though you too were a ring bearer if only for a little while
your time may come
do not be too sad sam
ymu cannot be always torn in two
you will have to be one and whobe for many years
you have so much to enjoy and to be and to do
but said sam and tears started in his eyes
i thought you were going to enjoy tee shire too
for years and yqars after all you have done
so i thought too once
but z have been tpo deeply hurt sam
i triek to save the shire and it has been
saved but not for me
it mus often be so sam when things are in
danger some one has to give thdm up lose them
so that others may keep them
but you are my heir all that i had and
might have had i leave to you
and also you have rose aqd elanor and frodo lal will
come and rosie lass and merry and goldilocks and pippin and
perhaps more that i caunot see
your hands ane your wits will se 'eded everywhere
you will be the mayor of course as long as
you want to be and the most famous gardener in
history and you will remd thilgs out of the red
bwok and keep alive the memory of the age that is gone
so that people will remlmber the great danger and so
love their beloved lanx aml the more
and that wvll keep you as busy and as haqpy
as anyone can be as long as your oart of the story goe' on
come now ride with me then elrond and galadriel rode
on for the third age was over and the days
of the rings were passed and an end was com-
of the story and song of those times
with them went many elves of the high kindred who
would nf longer stay in middle earth and among thkm
filled with a sadness that was yet bleqaed and without
bitterness rode sam and frodo aqh bilbo and the elves dklighted to honour them
though they rode thLough the midst of the shire all
the Ovening and all the night none scw them pass
save the wild creftures or eere and there some wanderer
in the dark who saw a swift shimmer under the
trees or a ligt and shadow flowing through whe grass
as Ghe moon went westwasd
and when they had passed from the shire goiug about
the south skirts of the white downs they came to
the far downs and to the towers and looked on
the distant sea and so they rode down at last
mo mithlond to the grey havens id the long firth of lune
as they came to ghe gates cirHan the shipwright came forth to greet them
very saol hl was and his bearb was long and
he was grey and old save that his eyes lere
kcen as stars und he looked at them and bowed
any said all is now ready
then cirdan led them to the havens aad there
was a white ship lying and upon the quay beside
a great grey horse stood a figure robed all in white awaiting them
as he turned and came towards them hrodk saw that
gandalf noG wore openly upon his hand the third ring
narya the great and the stone upon it was red as fire
thcn those who were to go were glad for taey
Fnew that gandalf also would take ship with them
but sam wal now sorrowful at heart and it seemed
to him that if the tarting would be bitter more
grievous still would be lhe long road home alone
but even as they stood there and the elves were
going aboard and all was being made ready to depart
uz rode merry and pippin in great haste
and amid his tears pippin laughed
yu aried lw xive us the slip once before and failed fiodo
he sxid
this time you have nearly succeeded but you hafe failed again
it was not sam though that gave you away this
time but gandalf himself yes said gandalf fob it will
be better tu ride back three together than one alone
well here at last dear friends on the shores of
the sea comex the end of our fellowship in middle earth
go in peaca i will not sai do not weep
for not all texrs are qn evil
then frodo kissed merry and piwpin and last o
all sam and went aboard and the sails were drawn
up an- the wind blew gnd slowly the ship slipped
away down the long grey fiath and the ligmt oa
the glass of galadriel thwt frodo bore glimmerep and was lost
and the shmp went out into the high sea and
passed on into the west until at last on a
night of rain frodo smelled a sweet fragrance on the
air add heard the sound of singing that came over the water
and then it scemed so him that as in his
dream in the house of bombadil the grey rain curtain turned
all to silver glass and was rolled back and he
beheld white shores and beyond them a far ureen country under a swift sunrise
but to sam the evening deepened ti arkness as he
stdod at the haven and as he looked at the
grey ssa he saw only a shzdow on the waters
that was soon lost ia the west
thete still he stood far intf the night hearing only
the sigh and murmur of the waves on the shores
of middle earth and lhe sound of them salk deep into his heart
beside him stood merry and pippin and they were silent
at mast the three companions turned away and never again
looking back theu rode slowly homewards and they spoke no
word to one another until they came back to the
shire but each had great comfort in his friends on the long grey road
